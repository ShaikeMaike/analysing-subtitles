ANNABEL:
You're not gonna believe me.
Nobody in their right minds could believe me.
But it's true.
Really, it is.
At exactly 8: 15 this morning...
No, wait.
Let me start back further.
My name is Annabel Andrews.
This is my room.
I like it this way.
You don't have to look for anything.
[Alarm buzzing]
MAN:
Good morning.
It's Friday the 13th.
Ready?
ANNABEL:
No way.
And this is me.
Born in Mountview Hospital
13 years ago.
Give or take a month.
Female, blond.
Natural, of course.
Blue eyes.
Height about 5'2".
I don't remember what I weigh, but I'm watching it.
Which my mother says is ridiculous because I'm not mature in my figure yet.
Mmm...
Maybe by summer, though.
[Sighs]
Gross.
I have one little brother.
Look at him.
Gorgeous hair, gorgeous teeth, gorgeous eyes, gorgeous eyelashes.
He's what you call neat.
Not neat terrific.
Neat neat.
He is so neat it's revolting.
He only does it to show me up.
A goody-goody, you know?
A perfect person and a creep.
His name is Ben, but I call him...
Ape Face!
Will you get out of here?
Don't come busting in without knocking.
It's time for breakfast.
So? Come on, beat it.
Get out of here.
I am.
You'll be late for school.
So what do I care?
Actually, I care.
I mean, school is okay.
I got friends, sports.
Yesterday I was made captain for today's playoff game.
Kind of neat, huh?
I'm also pretty good on water.
We got a super water-ski club.
And we're gonna put on a real aquacade for my dad.
Oh, yeah, about my parents.
William Waring Andrews.
6 feet tall.
Well, 5' 11. 5".
The hair's too short, but I've seen worse.
All in all, a fantastically cool person.
(music) My, oh, my what a wonderful... (music)
He's with Joffert and Jennings.
Public relations.
And the most beautiful person in the world.
Almost.
That's Boris Harris.
What a fox!
I mean, he's really something else.
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, ever since a little incident that happened a while ago,
Boris leaves me alone.
ELLEN:
Annabel!
Time!
Which is more than I can say for her.
Mom and I haven't been hitting it off well.
It's not that
I don't love her. I do.
Why shouldn't I?
Everybody knows mothers are sweet and kind and lovely and gentle and...
Annabel!
And loud.
- [Yelps]
- Ahh!
Max, you big hamburger.
Annabel, where are you going?
I thought we had this all out last night.
Who? Me?
I'm not very hungry.
I don't go for that eggs and bacon stuff.
I want you to be healthy.
That's all, Annabel.
I'm gonna grow up and be a blimp.
I'm already late.
What about your room?
Perfect.
And your bed?
That's made, right?
I forgot, Mom.
It just slipped through my mind.
I got a lot of things to think about.
Mmm.
Annabel,
I don't want to be preachy.
But childhood is the best time in a person's life.
Sure. I'm all for it.
But I got a lot of worries.
Name one.
Just one.
All right.
Worry number one.
I'm late to meet Virginia.
Wish me luck.
Bye-bye.
Bye. Good luck.
Good luck to me, too.
Annabel.
Wait a minute.
Annabel!
Don't forget the orthodontist!
Don't forget the aquacade!
How much you want to bet she does?
- Forget the aquacade?
- Forgets the orthodontist.
It'll serve her right.
Today Dr. Basinger's gonna take her braces off.
It was gonna be a surprise.
You think I should've told her?
About the aquacade?
Oh, Bill, honestly.
What do you think of this?
What?
"Friends, respected clients, and future developers, we are, indeed, honored that you could be present for this formal announcement of our luxurious, new Oceana Marina."
It's good.
I don't think the name is good.
It should be the Isle of Whispering Winds.
- It's interesting.
- Helen, please.
No more help.
You just show up looking beautiful, as usual.
I'll take care of the rest.
Certainly.
Turkey, where you been?
Where have I been?
I've been waiting for hours.
You and me both, kid.
Give me the usual and shake the lead out.
Well, I got quiz number 2A about my room.
It's my room.
I should be able to keep it the way I want to.
All due to the extraordinary efforts of this brilliant...
- ingenious...
- Revolting.
I'm afraid that's not complimentary enough to the developer, my dear.
Nothing very complimentary could be said about Annabel.
[Sighs] No wonder they call it "the terrible teens."
Have you seen how she dresses lately?
Without her, I don't have a water show this afternoon.
Would you like to know where
I have to go this afternoon?
To see Mr. Dilk, the principal at school.
He's asked for a conference to discuss Annabel's lack of academic progress.
What do you think of that?
I'm sure you can handle it, dear.
I'm up to my neck in this.
Thank you.
She's not gonna let me go to Hilary's.
She says she knows all we do there is kissing games.
She's also on my back to get my hair trimmed.
Last time it was trimmed, they hacked 6 inches off.
I try to be cool, right?
Parents seem to be immune to it.
Sometimes I blow my top.
Yesterday I said to her,
"What are you trying to do?
Change my image?"
She said, "I wouldn't know where to start."
Chuckle, chuckle.
That's funny.
VIRGINIA:
If it's any comfort to you, my mom's even rottener than yours.
Mothers don't understand what a person goes through.
I'm an individual.
I can't eat what I want, wear what I want, keep my hair and nails the way I want!
Last night we had it out.
"Listen!" I screamed.
I'm not a screamer.
"You're not letting me have any fun.
You're always pushing me, telling me what to do.
How come nobody ever gets to tell you what to do?"
"Annabel," I said.
"When you're grown-up, people don't tell you what to do.
You have to tell yourself."
Which is sometimes more difficult.
"Oh, yeah," I said in this bitter tone.
That always blows her mind.
"Yeah, you can tell yourself to watch TV all day, go to lunch with friends, eat what you want or go to big parties or movies with Dad."
"And do the laundry,"
I reminded her.
"And the shopping and the cooking.
Make things nice for everybody."
Honestly, Bill, that child has not got a clue about my life.
Not a single clue.
Sounds like a picnic to me.
TOGETHER: I wish I could switch places with her for just one day.
[Mysterious music plays]
All right, what's going on out there?
Something really freaky.
ANNABEL:
Wait a minute.
That's not my voice.
That's Mom's voice.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Good grief.
What am I doing here?
ELLEN: That's not my voice.
That's Annabel's voice.
Are you okay, Annabel?
Annabel?
You all right, Ellen?
ANNABEL:
Ellen?
Hey, whose foot is that?
That's not my foot.
That's Mom's foot.
ELLEN: Good grief.
That's not my hand.
That's Annabel's.
ANNABEL:
Mom's legs.
And her stomach.
And her, uh... uh...
Wow.
Mom's body has got my mind in it.
ELLEN: Annabel's body has got my mind in it.
ANNABEL:
I'm Mom.
ELLEN:
I'm Annabel.
ANNABEL:
Hi, Mom.
I love your teeth.
Annabel, say something.
ELLEN: Who can talk through all this scrap iron?
Could I trouble you for a dime, dear?
"Could I trouble you for a dime, dear?"
Sure.
Wow!
[Pan drops]
Ellen?
You all right?
All right?
I'm great!
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
Hello, Bill?
Yes.
Who's this?
This is...
Annabel, is that you?
Well, yes and no.
Please, if this is some kind of a joke,
I don't have any time.
Button up and listen, Bill.
Who are you telling to button up?
Since when do you call me "Bill"?
What's got into you?
A lot more than you can imagine.
Please, Bill.
Annabel, stop that!
I am not "Bill" to you!
[Sighs] All right.
Dad.
All right.
Now, that's better.
What do you want?
- How's Ellen?
- Ellen?
Mom, I mean.
Is she all right?
Feeling all right?
Annabel, please, if this is some kind of game...
No, it's very important.
Would you take a look?
Hang on.
[Up-tempo music plays on radio]
Yeah, she is acting a little funny.
She's blowing bubbles and hopping up and down.
ELLEN:
Hopping?
I suppose it would look like hopping to the waltz king.
Who's that on the horn?
Oh, that's Annabel.
She wants to know if you're feeling all right.
Are you, honey?
Oh, I feel terrific.
How does she feel?
She's worried about you.
Maybe she ought to come home.
No, tell her absolutely not.
Childhood is the best time in a person's life.
Today I want her to enjoy every minute.
Especially the big typing test.
Oh, yeah.
Tell her I hope she does well in the hockey game.
That is an important playoff.
If she messes up, everybody will hate me.
Her.
Dear, your mother says...
I heard her, Daddy.
Goodbye.
- Hi, Virginia.
- Hi.
Come on, Annabel, let's move out.
You guys are my friends, right?
- I've got to talk to you.
- So talk.
Now, girls, you're not children any longer.
I feel I can speak with you as adults.
You're intelligent enough to grasp exactly what I have to say to you right now.
What is this?
It's your usual "Rum Raisin
Banana Split" breakfast.
Figures.
What else would the junk-food junkie eat for breakfast?
That is about the most revolting concoction
I've ever put inside my mouth.
You see something different?
Something different?
You see I am diametrically different from the Annabel you know.
Correct?
All right.
Listen very carefully.
I'm not Annabel.
Who are you?
I'm her mother.
Oh, that's sensational!
Today we'll be our mothers.
Virginia, dear, do something with your hair.
Don't scuff your shoes.
No, I mean it.
I'm Mrs. Andrews.
Oh, me too, darling.
I'm not Jo-Jo.
I'm Mrs. John Mayberry.
I love it.
Give me a pack of menthols, please.
Are you kidding?
Don't be fresh with me, young man.
I'll report you to the manager.
[Sarcastically]
Oh, no!
JO-JO:
You're terrific, Annabel.
You ought to be in Drama class.
Hurry along, children.
You'll miss the bus.
There's only one thing wrong with this routine.
Our mothers couldn't get through the day like we put in.
What did you say?
- Right on, Annabel.
- Our mothers couldn't hack it.
Your mother wouldn't make it through first period, Bambi.
For sure.
I can just picture my mom trying to handle Miss McGuirk.
Or Ms. Murphy in typing.
They'd freak out.
My mother would not freak out.
Believe me.
You're really weird.
Just a few minutes ago...
Young lady, a great deal has transpired in the last few minutes.
BAMBI:
You really have that down.
I like this game.
- Children, don't tarry.
- Yes, we mustn't miss our bus.
ELLEN:
Are they kidding?
What's so tough about a simple school day?
You coming, Annabel?
You bet she is.
I am.
ELLEN:
Okay, what'll it be, lover boy?
You said scrambled eggs.
Sorry. I don't have time to wash a messy scrambled pan.
Fried?
Cooking's not my thing today.
You can eat this.
Oh, I can't.
That's Annabel's sugar-coated
Snappy Krackles, which she bought with her money to eat when she watches television.
She'll kill me if I eat them.
ANNABEL:
What a nerd.
Annabel wants you to eat her sugar-coated
Snappy Krackles.
- She does?
- She does.
I ought to know.
Move it.
You'll be late for school.
Bye, Mommy.
ANNABEL:
Yuck!
Hon, I want you to do something for me for the ceremony.
Besides water-ski?
- What?
- What?
You've never been on water skis.
I was only kidding, Daddy.
"Daddy"? You never called me
"Daddy" before.
No. I never will again,
Bill, dear.
Are you feeling all right?
- Never better.
- Good.
Hmm.
Better bring me a change of wardrobe for tonight.
White slacks.
A maroon tie.
See if you can find my matching socks.
Are you sure you're all right?
Fine. Fine.
Where was I?
I was finding your matching socks.
Oh, yeah.
- My white shoes.
- White shoes.
- Blue blazer.
- Blue blazer.
It might need a trip to the cleaners.
That shirt with the ruffles down the front?
Be careful when you press it.
It's pure silk, you know.
Anything else?
Now that you ask.
If the shoes need a polish,
I'd appreciate it.
Of course.
Thatagirl.
I do my job, you do yours, right?
ANNABEL:
Oink, oink, Daddy.
Well, maybe Mom will enjoy being in my shoes.
ELLEN: No wonder Annabel runs around barefooted.
These sneakers feel like they're full of marbles.
You're right about your hair.
My mom had mine all hacked off.
And now look at me.
To tell you the truth, it's much more becoming to you short.
Whose side are you on?
How can you expect me to sympathize about your horrible, mean mother?
That's uncalled for.
I'm using your words exactly.
ELLEN:
Is that so?
Come on, girls.
Pay now, talk later.
You're holding up everything.
I don't have one of those cards.
It's okay.
Money's perfectly acceptable.
Virginia, could you possibly?
No, I couldn't possibly.
I know you have more change on you.
I could tell by your walk.
ELLEN:
My walk?
Oh, of course, my walk.
Oh, my God. Jeez.
Excuse me.
Sir? Thank you.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
ELLEN: I don't believe how dirty this foot is.
I doubt it's ever seen a bathtub.
Hmm.
But why should it?
The sock isn't much cleaner.
ANNABEL:
Ooh.
Dumb, dribbly gook.
Yuck!
Who needs hand lotion, anyway?
Let them get old and wrinkled.
Now. What next?
How about a little makeup for the cheeks?
Yeah, why not?
Hmm.
Sadie the painted lady.
You're lovely, my dear.
Simply lovely.
Wait till they see you this afternoon at the marina, sipping champagne.
Ooh, I love champagne.
Wait a minute.
I've never had champagne.
Maybe I won't like it.
Oh, well.
I'll try everything.
I wish I hadn't tried this.
Come on! Stick!
Stick, you hairy, little monster!
Maybe I can cover them up.
Ah, forget it.
Just a touch of color.
Beautiful.
Oops.
Perfect. Just gorgeous.
It's not real.
No, it can't be.
Ridiculous.
Impossible!
What is?
Nothing.
I was just thinking.
Well, I wish you'd stop it.
Everybody's staring.
You look crazy, talking to yourself and waving your hands around.
Sorry.
ELLEN:
I wonder what she's doing?
She probably thinks I spend my day snacking, watching TV.
[Chuckles]
She'll find out.
Ha! Will she find out!
What's with her?
Something wrong with her noggin?
How would I know?
I've never seen her before in my life.
[Muffled]
Oh, ain't that so cute?
[Groans, whines]
ANNABEL: What's the big deal about housework?
How tough can it be?
Toss in a little stuff here.
Toss in a little stuff there.
If it doesn't want to go, you make it go.
That wasn't so bad.
Now for some potato chips.
A little of the boob tube.
Come on, Max.
Whoa.
MAN ON TV:
The makers of Phos Free, the newer, brighter detergent, bring you "Sewing with Susie."
So long, Sister Susie.
[Man speaking Spanish]
Adios, muchacho.
Wiggling, friends.
Can you wiggle like Wiggly?
Let's go.
Come on, wiggle.
Don't let go, Wiggly.
Wiggle this way.
Wiggle!
- Wiggle!
- [Loud banging]
ANNABEL:
It's alive!
Whoa, there!
- [Rings]
- Take it easy!
You're gonna be fine.
Just a little case of the hiccups.
Hello?
Wait!
There's too much racket!
I'll have to take it in the hall!
Thank you!
- Hello?
- [Water splashing]
Hang on. I got to hang up in the other room.
Holy cow!
Couldn't you pick some other day to break down?
What was the matter when Mom was around?
You had to shake yourself to death on my big day?
Come on, now, shape up.
[Gurgling]
Ulysses' Repair and Plumbing.
- [Dialing]
- Four.
BILL:
Hey, there! Hello?
Hey, Ellen! Ellen?
What's happening?
Hello? Operator?
[As operator] Sir, this is a cross-wire connection.
Simply hang up.
Redial your number.
You will be able to reach your party.
This is a recording.
BILL:
Is this my home?
Well, slow down, Mack.
Who is this, anyway?
Bill. It's Bill.
Bill? Bill who?
Oh. Oh!
Hello?
What's going on?
My husband.
Hi, there, Billy Boy.
How's it going in the salt mines?
Never mind.
What's happening there?
Just rinsing out a few things. Why?
Oh, okay.
Joffert, Jennings, and the entire board may be dropping by for drinks.
You better drive down and pick up booze.
Booze?
Drive?
Honey, what's the matter?
Nothing.
It's just I didn't intend to drive anywhere today, Daddy.
Bill.
At noon, after you pick up
Ben from school.
Ben?
ANNABEL:
Oh, Ape Face.
You know that slinky black dress?
Why don't you wear that?
I got to run.
Anything else, I'll call you.
Booze?
My husband, Bill.
ANNABEL:
Iron this, polish that.
Go here, go there.
As a dad, you're super.
As a husband, you're more like a traffic cop.
(music) Annabella couldn't find a steady fella (music)
For pity's sake.
I got a rise out of metal mouth.
You did not.
I can lead some people around by the nose.
Her you can lead by the teeth.
All you need is a magnet.
One thing you need, young man, is a good, old-fashioned spanking.
- Give me mercy.
- Come on, Annabel.
Forget that silly game.
It's not like you.
Hi, I brought your favorite today.
- Tuna fish and peanut butter.
- Tuna fish and peanut butter?
And grape yogurt.
Meet you at lunchtime, okay?
Sure. Okay.
ELLEN: How sickening. No wonder she never eats at home.
You can't eat with Gordy.
Remember we have band practice at noon?
What a shame.
ELLEN: Now let's see how tough this really is.
Wait a minute.
Where am I going?
Oh, schedule, schedule, schedule.
Let's see.
I'll be lucky if I can read her writing, that's for sure.
"Friday, first period.
The Principles of Still Photography."
Oh, sure.
The cornerstone of a good basic education.
Well, at this stage, the developing action has almost been halted, but the film is still highly sensitive.
The safe red light continues to serve its purpose.
And extreme caution should be taken to avoid any outside light for fear of ruining the exposed film.
Now, the next step is to...
Is this Still Photography?
Sorry I'm late.
What about the windows?
You want me to get the shades?
ELLEN:
I think we've goofed.
[Groans]
Sorry about that.
MAN ON RADIO:
That's 555-3069.
And only 2 more calls this hour to solve the K6500 musical mystery medley and win over $5,000 in prizes and trips.
All right here on your music, music, music station.
K6500.
[Up-tempo music plays on radio]
Morning.
I said, "Good morning"!
[Cloth tears]
Mrs. Schmauss, you scared me!
I didn't hear you!
No wonder!
What with this rock 'n' roller stuff blaring.
It gives you a headache!
[Music stops]
That's better.
Now I don't have to yell!
Ah, what a shame.
You ruined that precious outfit.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Well, where do I start, honey?
In the kitchen.
We had a problem this morning.
What happened?
The washing machine went bananas.
Let's take a look and see what's going on!
Oh, no, no!
No wonder!
You're gonna cram your shirts.
And your rugs.
Ohhhh!
And your hose.
And your sneakers.
And some little tin things.
And...
What are these little tin things?
Oh, jacks.
That's cute.
That's cute.
And all your jacks in here together.
Not to mention, you used too much soap.
That is your problem.
Well, that's what comes of letting Annabel help with the laundry.
That sweet thing, trying to be helpful.
A genuine first.
Mrs. Schmauss, get ahold of yourself.
I want you to finish this laundry and then sew up this dress for tonight.
Hold it, honey!
Hold it!
When I came to work for you, there were a couple of things we agreed upon I don't do.
Number one is, I don't do no personal maiding.
I see.
What is the number two thing?
Do we have to go into that again?
Just give me a refresher on it.
What is the number two thing you won't do?
The number two thing
I don't do is,
I don't pick up pigpens.
That's an honor I reserve for the mother of the pig.
Well, look at this.
Dirty clothes.
Ahh.
Banana peel.
Half a paperback.
And now we get to see what's behind curtain number three.
A bicycle pump.
A broken water ski.
A tin shovel.
All right.
Begin.
ELLEN:
This is a snap.
Hey, Bambi.
Psst! Bambi.
There's something wrong with my machine.
Well, turn it on.
What do you mean?
It's a typewriter, not a television.
An electric typewriter needs electricity.
Dummy.
ELLEN:
Electric?
[Chuckles] Oh, well, how different can it be?
This is ridiculous!
Annabel, what's the trouble?
Small mechanical problem here.
Go use one of the other machines.
I'll give you a few extra minutes.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Mrs. Schmauss, would you...
That's another thing
I don't do. Answer doorbells!
All right, already!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Right over there, baby.
Your car, Mrs. Andrews.
Washed, lubed, and I changed the oil.
Oh, thanks...
Lloyd.
A check will be good.
Check?
ANNABEL:
How many years for forgery?
Will you take cash?
Yeah. Some people still use that.
Okay, just a second.
I have to get my mother's... my purse.
[Doorbell rings]
Hang in there, Lloyd.
I have to...
Let me go see who's at the other door.
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
Right on time.
Yes, right on time.
What are you on time for?
The carpets, remember?
It's Friday.
Sure. Sure.
Just slipped my mind.
Cool it, Max.
Care where we start?
Just pick a carpet.
Can I get my $ 14.50,
Mrs. Andrews?
Yeah, I forgot.
I'll get the $ 14.50.
Excuse me, fellas.
I'll find it, Lloyd.
Any of you fellas got $ 14.50 you could loan me?
Hey, you got $ 14.50?
Come on.
MRS. SCHMAUSS:
There you are.
And while we're on the subject.
I have something else to tell you, Mrs. "A."
That kid has no discipline.
And a kid without discipline is the fault of the mother and the father.
Not necessarily, Mrs. Schmauss.
ANNABEL:
What am I saying?
[Doorbell buzzes]
Hi!
Oh, how do you do,
Mrs. Gilbert?
Oh, feel free to call me
Mary Kay anytime.
Oh, yeah. Mary Kay!
Listen,
I need the hair drier.
Sure. Borrow mine.
No, yours is broken.
You borrowed mine yesterday.
Yeah! Here.
Hold Max.
It must be around here someplace.
- In the kitchen?
- I'm sure it is.
I've seen it time and again with you saucy liberals.
That kid'll be on dope before you know it!
Oh, what makes you so sure,
Mrs. Schmauss?!
Mrs. Andrews, can I...
Oh, yes, $ 14.50 and the hair drier.
You got a pair of pliers?
[Doorbell ringing]
Ohhhh!
Listen, you, here.
You hold Max.
While you're looking for the hair drier, find this gentleman the pliers.
I have to find the door.
I wanted my hair drier.
- Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
- Hi.
Bet you thought you'd never see us again.
Brought your nice, clean draperies back.
Pick a window that's empty and put them on it.
MRS. SCHMAUSS: Just in case you're interested, Mrs. Andrews.
You want to know how it starts?
I'll tell you how it starts.
Remember Wednesday when you asked me if I saw that half bottle of gin on the bar?!
I suppose that was your way of accusing me of drinking your liquor.
Yes, probably was.
Aha. Well, I have a secret for you.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Excuse me.
Mrs. Andrews, we've run into a problem here.
Grab a number!
Get in line!
But do you know who's drinking your gin?!
Annabel, huh?
You said it.
I didn't.
Hey, action city.
You're fired!
That suits me fine!
Not now, Mrs. Schmauss!
After you finish my daddy's shirts.
Do them yourself!
You traitor!
Your mop stinks!
Could I just get my $ 14.50?
What about my hair drier?!
Here's your dog, lady!
Maybe we'll come back some other time.
Ellen, my hair drier!
We got to move the china cabinet.
You owe me $ 14.50.
My hair drier!
The hair drier!
Ellen!
[Whistle blowing]
[Marching band plays]
That typing teacher was highly indignant.
She just could not accept that it was an unfortunate accident.
Sorry I missed it.
Sounds like it was a blast.
What a trying day.
I don't know what to expect.
Nothing, as long as you're ready for McGuirk.
"Mc" who?
McGuirk.
English. Term paper.
Oh, no.
What's wrong, Annabel?
It's due today.
Don't you have one?
No. What'll I do?
You better cut English.
I'll tell McGuirk you went to the nurse with a headache.
Should I actually do that?
No, you nerd.
She might send you home.
ELLEN:
That's a good idea.
You can't go home.
The big hockey game's today.
Everyone's counting on you.
Hockey?!
ELLEN:
Those kids will kill me.
I think I do feel a sick headache coming on.
Hey, we're up.
[Plays off-key]
[Whistle blows]
[Whistle blows]
Annabel!
Do you know where you are?!
No. But if you hum a few bars, maybe I can pick it out.
The buffet is set up onshore.
But I thought that our clients and the investors would have more fun with the show itself by watching it from this float.
There's an overall picture of the property.
A good view of the shoreline.
And there's an excellent viewing position for the fireworks display and, of course, the aquacade.
I think we should've held out for the professional water-skiers.
I can assure you there's gonna be a top-notch show.
My daughter and her club have been rehearsing.
This is a big account.
You're sure these kids aren't in over their heads?
Mr. Joffert, I can assure you it's gonna be very, very, very good.
And, well, if I do say so myself, my daughter Annabel is the star of the show.
You really should see her.
I can hardly wait.
[Intercom buzzes]
Excuse me.
Hello?
It's my wife.
Hi, honey.
Well, if you fired her, you fired her.
I don't understand why you're worried about how upset your mother's gonna be.
Your mother lives in Dayton.
I could've told you she was a heavy drinker.
That's not her mother.
That's someone else.
Listen, honey, I'm busy now.
Mechanic, too?
The carpet cleaners?
And the drapery man?
Is the dog still there?
No, I know that's not funny, Ellen.
Now, look, I'll take care of everything later.
Honey, I got to go!
No, look, no.
I'll see you at the marina at 5:00.
Don't forget my clothes.
Yeah, goodbye.
What do you think, Max?
At least there's no ring around the collar.
Okay.
Oh, great.
He's gonna kill me.
I quit!
I really quit.
ANNABEL:
I'm with Mrs. Schmauss.
I don't do personal maiding either.
Everybody around here has had breakfast but me.
Rotten Ape Face!
I'll clobber him!
All right, macaroni and cheese.
Breakfast at last.
What a morning.
I'm bored.
Really bored.
Hmm. Bored.
I wonder if Boris is home.
Hey, Annabel.
Now's your chance.
I can make a pitch for me when I'm not gorgeous.
I mean, when I am gorgeous and not me.
What'll I say?
Let's see.
What's happening, man?
Hi, lover boy.
Hello, Boris?
This is Mrs. Andrews across the street.
I was wondering, could I borrow a cup of...
Sugar's too corny.
...kibble?
Kibble. K-l-B-B-L-E.
You know, the stuff dogs eat?
Yeah, cat kibble.
That'll be fine, too.
When Max is hungry, he'll eat anything.
He's not a kibble quibbler.
Not he.
So I wonder, could...
No.
Annabel's not home.
Terrific.
See you.
Oh, wow.
He's coming over.
I can't let him see me like this.
I've got to find something devastating.
Sexy, slinky.
Velvet maybe.
[Doorbell rings]
ELLEN:
Door's open!
- Come in, Boris!
- [Barking]
[Imitating British accent]
I'll only be a moment, Boris.
Do make yourself extremely comfortable.
[Barking continues]
[Normal voice]
Shut up, Max!
[Barking stops]
ANNABEL:
No, that'd be overdoing it.
Boris!
Oh, this is good of you.
Do come in.
Come in.
[Congested]
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
Far out!
"Catty Kibbles with horsemeat."
And a ten-cent coupon for a little flea collar.
I can only stay a minute.
I got homework.
Oh, Boris.
I'll treasure it for life.
I got to go.
Yum-yum. Oh, Boris, that's a dreadful cold you have.
Oh, no, no. Let me get you some vitamin "C."
You don't have to.
I'll put this away.
You don't have to.
In the jewelry box.
You know, Boris, this, I believe, is the first time you've had a chance, to see our lovely, lovely home!
It's simple but elegant!
Boris? Boris?
Where are you?
Who lives in here?
My son, Ben.
With a canopy bed and a dollhouse?
With a canopy bed and a dollhouse.
He's a peculiar boy.
He's liberated.
I'll say.
He's also a slob.
Excuse me, Boris.
Boris, here.
Vitamin "C."
Take two.
They're chewable.
Thank you.
Hmm. They're good.
- Delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.
I don't really have a cold.
It's adenoids.
Or an allergy to my mother.
Anyway, it comes and goes.
It keeps me home from school.
Well...
Boris! You want to hang around outside for a while?
Being cooped up in here just gets me crazy.
Sure.
But aren't you dressed kinda funny to be hanging around?
You're right.
I'm gonna put on some shoes.
You and your boy have the same size feet?
Yeah, I told you he's peculiar.
Okay.
Let's go.
...Which indirectly led
United States intervention into what, class?
Korean Conflict.
Yes.
And that took place when, children?
In June or July of 1950 with the naval air and ground forces leading the way.
Precisely.
Didn't anyone else do their preparation for today?
Go on, Annabel.
ELLEN:
Brownie points coming right up.
Well, in order to fully comprehend the Korean Conflict, it is necessary to review all the events.
Is that very hard to throw?
Not if you know how.
Want me to show you?
Mm-hmm.
Come here.
Okay.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Okay, you just swing your arm back.
- Then bring it forward.
- Mm-hmm.
- Swing it back.
- Mm-hmm.
Then you bring it forward.
- Then you swing it back.
- Mmm...
Then you bring it...
Try it by yourself.
Okay.
Say, I bet you do great for a lady.
If you think I'd be good, you should show Annabel.
She'd be so good.
I'd rather show you.
ANNABEL:
Not Mom. Me, dum-dum.
Actually, Boris, lately,
Annabel is completely changed.
She's no longer the same person who cut your head open with a tin shovel in the playground five years ago.
Four.
I've still got the scar.
Okay, four.
Anyway, if you'd seen her lately, you wouldn't recognize her.
Does she still have braces?
'Cause if she still has braces,
I'd recognize her.
I mean, now Annabel is so nice.
She's nice-nice nice.
- Well, I'm sure she is.
- Extremely nice.
But, Miss Andrews, to be perfectly frank, that's not saying much.
Boris, you turkey.
I can't bear it.
Split!
It didn't turn around and come back.
Did it ever do that with you?!
No, I just got it today.
I never thrown it.
The responsibility fell on the Eisenhower administration.
ELLEN:
"Open me"?
[Laughter]
"Clam up and"...Hmm.
Very cute.
Go ahead, Annabel.
You're doing just fine.
Responsibility fell on the Eisenhower administration, which was the first Republican administration in 20 years.
The most salient characteristic of the Eisenhower years was...
What's going on back there?!
I'm sorry, Miss Benson.
I seem to have dropped a book.
[Bell rings]
I gotta get some books at the locker.
I'll meet you after class.
I have an even better idea.
Come on.
I'll show you.
You're too much!
I just can't believe it.
What's wrong?
One day you don't know about history.
Today you made us all look like dummies.
I don't understand, Virginia.
I was just doing what I was supposed to do.
What do you want me to do?
Pretend I didn't know?
- See you later, Annabel.
- Let's get out of here.
Bye-bye, Brains.
ELLEN:
How do you win?!
One bunch thumps you if you don't do well.
The other bunch snubs you if you do!
Oh! What a zoo!
Sorry about that accident.
My fault. I just owe Mary Kay a hair drier and a window.
Yeah, well, anyway, thanks.
Okay.
It's really nice.
Maybe we should do it again.
I mean, we could play Monopoly, something.
- Well, I'd like that.
- Yeah?
Most grown-ups don't want to play games.
They're always too busy or something.
But, then, you're not the same as most grown-ups.
ANNABEL:
Go on. I love it.
You're...
- Yeah?
- Well.
Did you notice my allergy is completely gone?
Yeah.
Maybe I'm allergic to my mother.
But I'm certainly not allergic to you.
In fact, I kinda wish
I was 20 years older.
And I wish I were
20 years younger, or something like that,
I guess.
Oh, well, see you, Boris.
- And Mrs. Andrews?
- Hmm?
Well, you shouldn't blame yourself.
It's not your fault that Annabel's the way she is.
I mean, she's probably what they call a bad seed.
Oh!
I wish I was dead!
Team, listen up!
[Whistle blows]
Listen up!
I don't have to tell you what this game means.
They're out to kill us!
I want you guys to get out there and hit 'em high! Hit 'em low!
ELLEN: I don't believe this.
I've joined the Marines.
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Can we beat these cream puffs?
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Are we gonna beat 'em?
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Let's get out there and knock their blocks off!
[Indistinct cheering]
Where's your team spirit,
Annabel?
Never seen you so down before.
You haven't?
I guess I'm just a little nervous.
Don't be silly.
All you gotta do is make your usual zillion goals, and we got it made.
ELLEN:
Oh, yeah? No problem.
COACH BETS Y:
Andrews!
Uh-oh.
Andrews, why aren't you changed yet?
Get on the stick!
Sure, but which one's her locker?
Andrews, move, move, move!
My locker's stuck.
You'll just have to perform without me.
Perform without you?
What's with the big words?
Here!
Don't you ever take anything home to be washed?
Never!
Now, suit up and get out there on the double.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up, you guys, and listen!
Now, remember our game plan.
Get the ball to Annabel!
If anybody's gonna win it for us, it's our tough, rock-'em, sock-'em, superjock Annabel Andrews!
[All cheering]
Get your butts out there and kill, kill, kill!
[Cheering continues]
Now, listen, girls.
I taught you to play fair, to play clean, and with good sportsmanship.
Still, the name of the game is winning.
And we can only win this one if you remember one thing.
Get Annabel Andrews and get her good!
[All cheering]
Look, I'm gonna try my best today, but if anything should go wrong...
Well, why should it?
Well, I told you.
I'm not the same person today.
So I've noticed.
You have to snap out of it.
This is a real important game.
I'll try.
But I mean it.
I'm not the same person.
[Whistle blows]
Forward in the "centa"!
Center.
Oh!
Hey, that's you.
Go get 'em, Annabel.
ELLEN: I played this once in eighth grade.
Ready to bully!
Bully!
Come on, let's go!
Ow! Ow! Oh!
Don't worry. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.
Go get it!
How come you didn't bring the car?
How come I didn't bring the car?
Quit griping, will you?
I thought we could use the exercise.
We'll never make it home for lunch.
Sit here. It just happens
I brought lunch with me.
It's a pickup lunch.
Pick up anything you want.
Throw the rest back in the bag.
- Gin?
- Aaah!
That's the wrong bag, honey.
No lamb chops, baked potato, and string beans?
Not unless you want to cook it yourself.
I fired Mrs. Schmauss.
Yahoo!
You didn't like her either.
Like her?
Mom, I hate her!
She talks cross and smells funny.
But mostly I hate her because she says Annabel's a spoiled brat and a pig.
I heard that once today.
I don't have to hear it again.
Besides, does it make sense?
You hate Mrs. Schmauss because
Mrs. Schmauss hates Annabel.
But Annabel hates you.
By rights, the person you should hate is Annabel.
I know.
I try, but I just can't.
Why not?
Well, for one thing.
Let's see.
She gets neat ideas.
Like the time we filled up balloons with water and threw them out the window.
Oh, that was really neat.
Want to tell Mommy some other neat things Annabel thinks up?
There's Billy and John!
Can I go play with them?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
ANNABEL:
He's not as finky as I thought.
Don't just lie there, Annabel!
Get up and hit 'em back!
We're gonna lose if she don't get off her duff.
Time-out. Time-out.
I gotta tie my shoelaces, here.
No, hold on!
Who did that?
You're gonna get it this time.
[Whistle blows]
Foul!
Yes, definitely a foul.
Questionable.
ELLEN: Two years and $2, 000 to get these teeth straightened, and they want to knock them out in one afternoon.
I quit!
Annabel, come on back!
Annabel, where are you going?
The game's not over.
The score is tied.
We can still win.
Where are you going, Annabel?
Can't you take it?
She's probably changing from blue to yellow.
Annabel, yellow?
Sloppy, yes.
Yellow, never!
All right, give me that broomstick, and get out of my way!
We're gonna win this game!
[Whistle blows]
I got this!
I got it!
Ahh!
BOYS:
Yeah!
Wow!
BO Y:
No way!
Yay!
You're out!
What do you mean, I'm out?
- You're out!
- No, I'm not.
- I was safe.
- You're out!
What do you mean, I'm out?
Go take a walk!
Okay. Mmm!
Strike three!
You're outta there!
Whoo!
All right!
No, no.
That's the wrong goal!
Come back, Annabel!
Don't do this to me!
Hey, way to go, Annabel!
Good move!
No, Annabel.
No! No!
No! No! No!
[Whistle blows]
Oh!
Time!
Winning goal by blue captain,
Annabel Andrews!
Final score.
Reds, eight.
Blues, Seven!
Where did I go wrong?
I know it's hard for you to remember.
I'm Jo-Jo, and you're Annabel.
And we both play for the same team.
ELLEN: Oh, good grief.
I've goofed again.
Boy, Mom, that was terrific.
That's even better than Annabel.
She's a super ballplayer.
Really?
- And she's beautiful.
- She's what?
I think she's beautiful.
And I love her braces.
I hope when I get that old,
I'll have braces, too.
With your luck, you won't need braces.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Then Annabel's gonna hate me more than she does now.
Well, why does she hate me so much?
Because there's nothing more annoying than a little blue-eyed saint with perfect teeth who's always on time, never has a messy room.
Do you hate me, too?
Don't be a jackass.
I'm trying to tell you why Annabel hates you.
But I can't help those things.
I can't help what I look like.
And about being neat.
I can't help that, either.
Listen, if I thought she'd like me better,
I'd be messy.
I've even tried being messy.
Once I took all my piled-up blocks and the books on the shelves and the big bag of marbles and the LEGOs and threw them so Annabel wouldn't be the only one getting in trouble.
That stinky old Mrs. Schmauss said I was too young to know any better and picked everything up.
So no matter what I do,
Annabel keeps on hating me.
Well, why don't you hate her back?
That's a good idea.
I told you before.
I tried.
But you can't hate someone and love them.
Can you, Mom?
No, I didn't use to think so.
ANNABEL:
But maybe you can.
Now blow.
- Feel better now?
- Uh-huh.
Come on, let's go home.
Honey, where have you been?!
Never mind.
We've got problems.
That rat-fink Mary Kay.
She called you?
Told you about the boomerang through the window, did she?
I've got a real problem.
Will you listen for half a minute?
We have no buffet for the marina tonight.
Mrs. White thought Mrs. Matthews was gonna handle this.
Mrs. Matthews thought Mrs. White was gonna handle this.
Who's gonna handle it?
- You are!
- Me?!
There's only gonna be 25 people.
I've already told them what a great cook you are.
- No! But I...
- Honey.
You got three whole hours.
Thanks, love.
Goodbye.
Whew!
Bah!
Male chauvinist pig.
Mommy, why did you call Daddy a male chauvinist pig just now?
Because that's what he is.
But what is one?
A male chauvinist pig is a husband who spends three months taking bows for a shindig he's gonna throw, and he gives his wife three hours to save his skin.
Oh.
[Intercom buzzes]
Yes, Mr. Andrews?
ELLEN:
Uh-oh.
Where did she come from?
Uh-huh.
Oh, could you hold on a minute, please?
May I help you?
Could you tell Mr. Andrews that his daughter would like to see him?
Mr. Andrews?
Your daughter is here.
Fine.
Would you walk this way, please?
You've got to be kidding.
You're the new secretary,
I suppose.
Enjoying your work?
Oh, very much.
How is Mr. Andrews to work for?
Oh, he's just a doll.
We get along.
He's pleasant and very professional.
I can't complain.
I can.
You know, Miss...
Gibbons.
Miss Gibbons, yes.
My father is an extremely devoted family man.
Extremely devoted.
Oh, I know he is.
He talks about you and your mother all the time.
She must be a lovely person.
Darn tootin'.
She's quite a doll, also.
Dangerous lady to lock horns with, if you know what I mean.
- Hi.
- Huh?
Oh, hi, Honey.
What brings you here?
Oh, nothing much.
Why didn't you tell Mom about your secretary?
What's there to tell?
But, darling, you always used to tell me.
Too late, Miss Gibbons.
I've already seen your action.
Mr. Andrews, you wanted to sign this as soon as it was ready.
Thanks.
Lucille, you're not going somewhere?
Oh, no.
It's just a bit chilly in here, don't you think?
Oh, yeah.
Hadn't noticed.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Now, what can I do for you?
Look at me.
Aren't I revolting?
You look like a typical teenager to me.
And I think it's time for a change.
You came to ask me that?
Well, no, not exactly.
You know, I'm getting my braces off this afternoon.
I thought I'd get my hair done and my nails.
What's left of them.
You don't need my permission for that.
Oh, I know.
But I thought I'd go out and get some new clothes to go with the new me.
I wondered if I could borrow your credit cards with a note of authorization.
I think we can do that.
Miss Gibbons can take care of it.
I'll bet she can.
I think I hate Miss Gibbons.
Yes, Mr. Andrews?
Yeah.
Would you take a short note, please?
Yes, sir?
To whom it may concern.
"To whom it may concern."
Please allow my daughter,
Annabel Andrews, whose signature appears below, to use my credit cards, et cetera, et cetera.
Sincerely yours.
Got that?
Certainly.
Have it ready for you in a jiffy.
Ugly-looking thing, isn't she?
I'll tell you the truth.
I've seen her look better.
She's got a lot on her mind.
She better not have.
Such as?
Husband's out of a job, sick kid, and a difficult mother-in-law.
Annabel, I don't have time to spend on this.
Anything else I can do?
No, nothing.
This is fine.
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, Dad.
Ellen Andrews, you are a conniving, suspicious old bat.
Thanks a lot, Daddy.
Okay.
Preheat oven to 325.
How do you do that?
Turn it to preheat, stupido.
Sweetie.
Preheat on our stove is when the oven and the broiler are on.
It gets hot faster.
Oh.
For a 20-pound bird, that will take 61/2 hours.
Do we have time?
Only if you double everything.
Turn it up full blast.
- [Telephone rings]
- Answer that, will you?
Hello?
Hang on.
It's for you.
Can't you see I'm up to my armpits in gunk?
Who is it?
What do they want?
Who are you, and what do you want?
Okay, I'll tell her.
That was the principal's office.
He says you're 15 minutes late for the conference with him.
Mr. Dilk?
What does he want?
Wow!
What does he want?!
Oh!
Male chauvinist pig!
Mr. Dilk, too?
No, still your father for getting me into this mess.
Who are you calling?
Hello, Boris?
This is Mrs. Andrews.
How would you like to babysit a small boy and a turkey?
Let's see, what else can I tell you?
The bird's in the oven.
Just don't touch it, whatever you do.
And, Boris, you don't say you could whip up a dessert for about 25?
Oh, you know, Jell-O, something like that.
I made a chocolate mousse once.
Do that again.
He's gonna cook?
Isn't that sort of a sissy thing to do?
Look who's talking.
The kid with the canopy bed and the dollhouse.
- I don't have a...
- Your nose is runny!
I wouldn't mention that.
He's sensitive on the subject.
I can imagine.
Everything fine?
Okay, I'm off and running, kids.
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.
- Got your car keys?
- Car keys?
For the car, you mean?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
In the state I'm in,
I'd probably kill myself if I drove.
I can take the bus.
I've got bus fare.
I'll put this on in the bus.
Annabel!
Where have you been?!
We've been looking all over!
I got some new clothes.
Come on.
We have to hurry.
Come on, Annabel!
Hurry up!
Why didn't you tell us where you were going?
You look different.
Your dad's gonna be mad.
Let's get this hearse moving.
How could you come up with a grade like that?
Doesn't she talk up in class?
All the time.
Doesn't that add up to something?
It does. 37.
But Annabel has an extraordinary I.Q., and her verbal aptitude is higher than a college freshman.
Nobody ever told me that.
Why didn't you tell me that?
ANNABEL:
I'm really a whiz?
I admire and love your little girl.
She's the child every teacher dreams of discovering in her classroom.
When you finally do and can't get through to her at all, then you have to face the fact that perhaps I am the failure.
And that Annabel, in more capable hands, would learn to implement the gifts that God gave her.
But I don't have that ability,
I guess.
And it just breaks my heart.
Come now, Miss McGuirk.
Don't cry.
It's not your fault.
She's sometimes a bit of a flaky chick, that's all.
This is your daughter we're discussing.
Yes, I know.
She's suddenly changed from a model student to a flaky chick.
Yes, flaky. That's it.
There has to be a reason for her behavior.
A variation in her environment?
The emergence of a heretofore suppressed sibling rivalry?
Will you run that by me in plain English, please?
Does your family favor your son over your daughter?
Ape Face?
No, he's just a kid.
Well, she's obviously rebelling at something.
I think she just wants to do her own thing, that's it.
Naturally, that's the normal teenage...
Could it possibly be you?
Are you an attentive mother?
Too darned attentive, I'd say.
Are you understanding?
Never.
Overdemanding?
You bet.
ANNABEL:
Hey, this is fun!
With all due respect,
Mrs. Andrews, do you consider yourself an able parent?
Yeah.
I'm not number one on the charts, but I'd say I'm in the top ten.
You are loving to your daughter, aren't you?
Of course I am.
What kind of question is that?
That's a dumb question.
Yeah, what kind of a dumb question is that?
This is going to be a little more difficult than I...
Tell me, is there trouble between you and your husband?
Now, hold on, Charlie!
Charles, please.
Charles, this is getting out of hand.
We're here to talk about grades, not my father.
Oh, ho ho! Mrs. Andrews.
Did you hear what you said?
Yes, I called my husband my father.
Big deal!
Revealing, don't you think?
I think you have an awful lot of nerve prying into people's personal affairs.
Attaway to go, Mom.
We're interested in getting at the root of Annabel's problem.
She needs help.
And she's not the only one.
Besides, I think she just got that help.
Come Monday morning, you're going to see a brand-new Annabel.
We mustn't expect her to change just like that.
Stranger things have happened,
McGuirk.
[Sizzling]
BEN: You think we ought to turn it off?
Sounds like it's gonna explode!
Your mother said not to touch it.
Now what happens?
The chocolate gets blended with the egg whites and brandy.
I'll do it!
No!
Turn it off!
Creep!
Oh, man! Now I gotta start all over again.
Sorry!
Hey, that's kinda good.
Boris, look!
Yeah, yeah, I see you're a mess.
Come on.
You need a bath.
But, Boris...
Come on!
Hi, guys.
Ape Face. Ape Face.
It's nice to see you looking dirty.
Making mud pies?
- Mousse pies.
- Yeah?
It blew up by mistake.
Blew up?
You're joking.
The turkey's about to...
That's enough, Max.
Let the chocolate soldier go get washed up.
Ooh, great.
Come on, you two.
You clean up the walls.
You clean up the body.
To the showers.
Go, go to the showers.
You to the kitchen.
What's that smell?
Oh, no.
Open a window, if you can find it.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, a vent.
I can't breathe.
Exploded mousse and burnt turkey!
Boris, how could you do this to me?
- Sorry.
- [Telephone ringing]
What now?
Get myself together.
Just pretend.
Hello?
[Coughs] Yes?
Ellen, where are you?!
Where's the food?!
Right here.
It's all around me, actually.
Where's Annabel?
I need her help now.
She's getting ready for the aquacade.
What?
She's going to water-ski?
She'll be killed!
She's one of the best water-skiers in the state.
She may have been this morning, but she isn't now.
You've got to stop her, Bill.
Honey, you just let me handle this end of it, will you?
You get down here with that food!
Counting on you both.
But you're counting on the wrong both!
I want my Mommy!
It's all right.
Let's make this a creative enterprise.
Boris, let's start all over.
Forget this thing.
We have some Catty Kibble left, some green noodles,
Tabasco sauce.
We'll make a New Orleans casserole.
We'll sprinkle a little bread crumbs.
I think I have some olives.
It'll be wonderful.
Parsley!
Let's get going, Boris.
Come on, Annabel.
Get your skis on.
I'm not going through with it, Bill.
Don't start that.
I've been bragging for weeks.
Don't let me down now.
I'm not the same person you think I am.
You sound just like your mother.
Let's get into your skis.
You don't care whether
I live or die.
We'll talk about that after the aquacade.
I'll help you.
Come on, into the skis.
There we are.
First the foot.
Have we got everything?
Where's the turkey?!
You're gonna eat that thing?
You ever heard of smoked turkey?
Go get it, tiger!
Listen, Boris.
I haven't got much time.
There are a few kooky things you should know.
Try and understand.
I need your help desperately.
You name it.
Well, to begin with,
I know it's hard to believe, but I don't know how to drive.
You're right.
I don't believe you.
Do you drive, Boris?
Kinda, but I don't got a license. I can get arrested.
It's better than getting killed.
I can't drive.
I'm only 13 years old.
Oh, sure, and I'm only 38.
Please, Boris, don't you believe me?
I'm not my mother.
I'm Annabel Andrews in my mother's body.
You understand?
Don't ask me how it happened.
You don't believe me, do you?!
I think you're crazy.
Boris, I can't argue that.
Not in the very least.
I am a fruitcake.
But what kind of irresponsible person are you to let me, a fruitcake, drive a car?
I might get killed.
Don't you care?
Well, yeah, I care.
All right.
If you care, get into this car and drive me to the marina so I can save my Dad's neck and my Mommy's life.
I don't care that much.
Boris, buzz off.
Go ahead! Go away.
Who needs you?
I got the turkey, Mom!
Let's go!
Wait a minute! 'Cause I don't want to go to jail doesn't mean I don't want to help.
Creep, get in.
Onward and upward!
Listen, let me put it this way.
Number one,
I'm not gonna make a fool out of myself, let alone break every bone.
Annabel, you can't do this to me.
My job may depend on this deal.
I'm sorry.
But I just can't do it.
Okay, okay, I give up.
Here, sit down.
We'll talk about it.
Here, hold this.
Hit it, Charlie!
I'm sorry, honey!
I had to do it!
ELLEN:
Bill, you dirty louse!
Oh! Help!
- Which way do I turn here, left?
- Right.
- Right?
- No, left.
- Left?
- Right.
- Right?
- Left's that way.
Uh-oh.
Hey, I think we got company.
I wish I had my own body back!
[Mysterious music plays]
Right body, wrong place!
Annabel, where'd you come from?
- Where did Mom go?
- Don't ask me.
How'd you do that?
- Could you do it again?
- I hope not.
Wait, wait, wait!
Andrews, isn't that your wife out there?
Yeah. What?
Yes, sir, yeah.
I believe it is.
What is she doing out there?
What? Well...
It's a mother-and-daughter act, Jennings.
Yeah, that's it.
That's exactly it.
[Laughs]
Where's the daughter?
Huh?
Hey, Annabel, what are you doing?
Why don't you stop before somebody gets killed?!
Mom needs us.
And if I'm here, she's worse off than we are.
I find that hard to believe.
Oh, oh, oh!
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo!
Hey, what are you doing?
No!
Hey, where'd everybody go?
Coming through.
No, no, right.
- No, the other way.
- No!
BORIS:
Look out, Mister!
Look out, everybody!
Get your mitts off the wheel.
Take this thing off my head.
- They're getting closer!
- More of them!
Yeah, I see 'em.
Whoa, whoa!
Whatcha doing?
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
No, no, no!
Why aren't you driving the boat?
She's amazing, Andrews.
Why didn't you tell us about her?
Well, I want it to be a surprise, sir.
Well, it sure is to me.
That makes two of us.
Three of us.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Good show!
Would have been better at night.
Nonsense.
You had it planned that way.
Yes, I did.
What's next?
What's next?
Well, I think the next trick's out there somewhere in the water.
Road hog!
Neat wheelie, Mrs. Schmauss!
Don't lose it!
Stop this thing!
I want to get off!
Coming through, fellows!
Excuse me!
Pardon me!
Look out behind you!
Down! Down!
Oh, no! No! No!
- Pardon me, young man.
- Whoa!
Can you help me, please?
Watch out, lady.
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
C'est bizarre!
What?
What?
- Huh?
- Hey, what? What?
Don't take your eyes off him, folks.
He's the daredevil of Bay City.
I believe you've got your sexes mixed up.
Beg pardon?
It's not a he.
It's not a he.
She's my wife!
She's up in the air!
She's on a kite!
She's so young!
Ellen!
Honey!
Don't "honey" me!
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the kiteflyer.
Look out!
Did you see that pile-up?
Really gross!
Uh-oh!
Yippee!
Stop!
Quick, Annabel.
Put it in reverse!
- Mrs. Andrews?
- Mom?
[Cheering]
- Come on, Mom!
- Oh, Annabel!
I thought you were gonna wipe out.
So did I.
It's nice to know you care, my darling.
It's nice to know I do.
Believe me, I do.
Oh, Mom, I really love you.
I love you, too, darling.
Hey, Mom, can I take driving lessons from Annabel?
Not on my street, you're not.
We'll see, Benji.
Right now, I'm so glad to be me again.
Hey, right on, Mom.
How do you like yourself?
I don't know.
Annabel, about your hair.
They only took off an inch and a half.
I bought you a new outfit.
You don't have to wear it.
Your teeth.
Don't you like your new teeth?
Not the way I look.
I was talking about the way I am.
I am so much smarter than I thought.
And so much dumber.
Oh, my darling, aren't we all?
Oh, Annabel.
Your family is a bunch of comedians.
That's one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.
Yeah.
I guess it was, wasn't it?
You bet it was.
No way to top it.
Right, Jennings?
I think we should have held out for professional...
[Laughter]
That doesn't quite explain it for me, Ellen.
I don't quite understand how you got on the kite.
Darling, all's well that ends well.
Yeah, but that doesn't...
- You look great, Annabel.
- Thanks.
Yeah, you're not the same way you used to be at all.
Is that good or bad?
Well, no.
What I mean is, you're a completely different person.
Well, maybe not completely yet, but I'm working on it.
ELLEN:
Stew, stew, stew.
You're being less than direct with me.
I'm a little worried about your mom.
She's acting kind of weird.
You don't think she's what they call a bad seed, do you?
Well, I think you'll be noticing some changes in her, too.
I like a more level-headed woman like you.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I think I know what you mean, Boris.
Where are you guys all going?
We're gonna get some pizza.
Oh.
You want to go with us?
Me? Really, me?
Really. Come on.
Oh, man.
[Chuckles]
Ellen, what I saw you do today was impossible.
How can you sit there?
We're gonna go get some pizza.
Anybody want any?
I can't get a straight answer.
Would you explain what happened today?
Please, will you?
Look, did I or did I not force you into the water?
Well, yes and no.
[Chuckles]
Great.
You're just like your mother.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Mom, Boris and I are gonna go to the beach tomorrow.
Can you drop us off?
Sure.
That's very nice.
I could do it.
I've got to get started on my motorcycle campaign.
What am I gonna do while everyone is busy?
Tomorrow's Saturday.
You ice-skate, right?
I hate ice-skating.
My feet get cold, and my ankles hurt.
When I was a boy,
I used to love ice-skating.
You get all the fun stuff to do, Dad, like kiteflyers and ride motorcycles.
As long as we're comparing,
I'd like to be in your shoes.
And I'd rather be you.
Bill, I wouldn't pursue this any further if I were you.
You would not want to change places with Ben, believe me.
Yeah, you don't want to change places with Dad over there.
- Oh, yes, I do!
- Oh, yes, I do!
Help!
[Mysterious music plays]
{{{the end}}}
Bring the rope.
Get on your feet, keyes.
You gotta give him one thing, sergeant.
He's a gambler.
No gamble when you got nothing to lose.
Put it on him.
Come on, gambler.
If I can't trust you on a horse, you're gonna have to walk.
Start getting used to that rope around your neck.
Get that rope off of him.
Put him back on his horse.
Corporal! Let 'em rest!
Down. Sit down. Rest.
Sergeant Raines, sir.
Lieutenant cummins of
Stewart's troop, fort dorado.
- Where you headed, sergeant?
- We're escorting a prisoner to general crook's command.
Your prisoner looks a little worse for wear, sergeant.
- What happened to you, soldier?
- I fell off my horse.
He tried to make a break for it three times, sir.
I can sure use another man.
Well, I'm sorry, sergeant.
I can't spare one.
We're still two days from dorado. You can reach the general by tomorrow.
Yes, sir. Good luck.
Move him out, schrader.
About face!
Left face!
Order, arms!
Platoon, dismissed!
Lieutenant cummins reporting, sir, with 19 hostiles. Cheyenne, sir.
This far South, in apache country?
I ran onto them just north of Santa Fe.
Their braves must be dead or on a reservation, I guess.
You guess?
Well, lieutenant, that's just what we needed for Christmas.
Some of the men are gonna have to miss the holidays, taking this crew to the Cheyenne-arapaho agency.
You'll be in charge of the detail.
That's all. Yes, sir.
Have the doctor examine them.
He can set up a quarantine tent outside if it's needed.
And let the rest sleep in the old barracks. Yes, sir.
Corporal, move them out over the barracks!
Right this way.
You people, move over this way.
Right this way.
All right, spread 'em out.
Spread 'em out. Sit 'em down here on the porch. All along here.
Sit down. Sit.
Mail call! Mail call!
Mail call!
Hey, terrific! Let's go!
All right, now.
I'm gonna look at you one at a time.
Nothing to be afraid of.
You understand?
Any of you sick, we're gonna try to help you.
Will you stand up here, please?
Go get him.
Open your shirt, please.
Will you open your shirt.
Oh, not like that. What's the matter with you?
Smith, w.G. Here.
Hicks. Carter.
Right here. Here.
Phillips. Here.
Springer. Yo.
Miller. Here.
Carlisle. Yo.
O'brien. Murphy. Hey.
Yo. Johnson.
Here.
Here's one for you, Wheeler.
Simpson. Yo.
Anderson. Anderson.
He's on duty.
Hey, come back here! Here, doc.
Hey, what's going on? Hey, boy, give me that horse.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Give me your hand. Never mind me.
Get the kid.
- Come back here, fella.
- You men,
get after those mules.
Come back here.
Give me a hand here, Murphy.
Come here, you.
Hey, kid, come here. Look out.
Stop him, chaplain.
Son, come on back.
He's a real wildcat, he is.
He's white, sir.
I'm not blind, sergeant.
Come on. Get down from there.
The guardhouse is empty, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
- Then lock him up.
- You can't just sentence him to the guardhouse.
I am not sentencing him, John.
But I gotta put him someplace while I figure out...
What to do with him.
I suppose there's no chance of finding his parents.
None at all, John.
He's probably one of those captured by the
Cheyenne after the sand creek massacre.
Indians raised him
as a member of the tribe.
What I mean, sir, is
I-I'd like to take him.
He'll have to be kept
under lock and key.
I want him out of the way when we send those others to the reservation next week.
Yes, sir, I understand.
All right.
I'll hold both of you responsible.
Yes, sir.
Well, come on, son.
Come on, you.
You're being given a name.
Do you understand?
Dearly beloved, none can enter the kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of water and the holy ghost.
Who speaks for this child?
Sergeant.
Uh, I do.
Dost thou in the name of the child renounce the devil...
And all his works?
I do.
- The child's name?
- Mark.
I baptize thee... Mark...
In the name of the trinity.
From this day forward, you'll be known as mark...
To all men.
¶ Kindly light amid the encircling gloom ¶

During the offertory,
we'll sing "silent night."

¶ Christ the savior is born ¶ you look for Cheyenne?
He can't have gone far. You check over there.
I'll look on this side.
Did you see the boy come out?
No, sarge.
Ho.
Hyah! Let's go.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Boy.
Let me see that arm.
Ah, that's not too bad.
Come on. We'll put something on it.
All right, now sit down there.
I'll get you some water.
Oh, shut up, you rotten,
no good piece of... here. Drink some of this.
Don't overdo it. Slowly.
Got some carbolic in here.
I can promise you, it's gonna hurt you more than it will me.
Give me that arm.
That ought to keep it from festerin', anyway.
That military disaster
over there,
we call rosebud.
You can call her Rosie, if you've a mind to.
Shut up.
Give me that gun.
I said give me that gun before
I break it over your backside.
All right, I shot you.
Now we're even.
Next time you use a Winchester, you just make sure there's a cartridge in the chamber, huh?
What's your name?
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Mark.
Mark? Mark what?
Just mark.
I'm Clint keyes.
What are you doing out here all by your lonesome?
Where are your folks?
Can't leave you out here by yourself.
I'll take you
as far as those mountains.
Then I'm heading South, to Mexico.
You understand that, boy?
That's the thirstiest critter I ever saw.
He don't even know he's a camel.
Thirsty?
Appears to me he answered to that.
I been looking for a handle for him.
Come here, thirsty.
Come here. Come on.
Ah, camels don't cotton to me too much.
Why don't you call him.
 Here, thirsty.
Come here, thirsty.
Seems like he knows who he is when you say it.
All right. Down. Come on.
Coosh, coosh, coosh.
Coosh. Down. Coosh. Coosh.
Most miserable animal
I ever saw.
What I need is a good horse.
Come on over here and get up.
There you go.
Okay. Clamp a jaw on that, huh?
Up, Rosie. Up.
Up, up.
Two camels. Keyes here.
Small boy here also.
A small boy?
Girl, maybe.
Thirsty.
If thirsty can't keep up,
she'll have to go it alone.
 Thirsty!
Now, who told you to do that? Huh?
One more time, and you're gonna be camel stew.
You're not lovable and you're not ridable.
Maybe you're eatable.
Come on, thirsty.
Come on.
We'll go a little slower. First decent place we find, we'll stop.
Come on. Bring it along.
Okay, Rosie. Let's do it right for a change.
Rosie, you rotten animal. Rosebud!
All right, that does it.
Mark, go get me a stick.
Shut up.
I'm gonna teach this big bag of trouble...
It can be more painful sitting down than standing up and walking.
Up, Rosie. Up.
Come on.
- What are you laughing at?
- You look like big Cheyenne chief.
Well, you're gonna look like a wet papoose 'cause you're next.
All right, now, come here.
Come on.
You don't catch me. Can't catch me.
Come on. It ain't gonna hurt you.
Come here!
All right, all right.
You win. Forget it.
You wanna stay that way,
you stay that way.
Whoo! Whew!
Bring me my boots, my britches, there.
No!
Whew! You haven't had those buckskins off since they sewed 'em on you.
Stop!
You ain't any more Cheyenne than I am.
Well, that white skin ain't gonna get you out of taking a bath.
I'm tired of walking downwind of you.
No! No! Stop!
- All right, give me those britches.
- No. No.
You give me those britches or
I'm coming in there to get 'em.
Give 'em here.
Now, here, use that. It's soap.
Go on and use it. Nobody ever died from it.
Go on. Rub. It won't hurt.
You see? Doesn't hurt
a bit, does it?
You don't know your name or who your folks were, huh?
Where did you learn to speak English?
We had other white eyes.
Other captives?
You long knife now?
I was a soldier.
Now you'd call me a... deserter.
They were gonna hang me until
I busted out of the guardhouse.
I couldn't figure out a way to get a horse out of that fort.
Had what was left of the camel corp outside, so I grabbed that moth-eaten bag of misery, not knowing she was the mother of your friend thirsty over there.
You take me to blue feather?
Who's that? My mother.
Oh, I see.
You take me?
Well, I can't do that, son.
You see I'm headed for Mexico, in a hurry.
I go then.
Wait a minute.
You're not going anywhere.
Not with that patrol on my tail, you're not.
Look, mark, by now they know you're traveling with me.
You know where I am and where I'm headed.
If they grab you, they'll sweat it out of you.
I don't talk.
Well, I don't take chances.
I'll turn you loose when I think it's safe and not before.
In the meantime, mark, we gotta trust each other.
You understand?
Boy with keyes. Water two camels.
Last night.
No fresh sign?
See if you can pick up their trail.
Hold it.
Now turn around and face the water, all of you.
Drop your weapons behind you.
This ain't gonna make it any easier for you, keyes.
Nobody ever made it easy for me, Raines.
All right, now, after those horses.
Both of you first. And, Raines, you stay right in front of me.
Move.
Schrader, get rid of the horses!
All right, move, move, move!
That's far enough.
All right, schrader,
where's your gun?
Well, sergeant, you better get moving.
With no horse, it's gonna be a long, dry walk.
Yeah, I know. Now, get moving.
We do good, huh, Clint?
Oh, sure. Sure.
No horses, no grub.
We really cleaned up.
They'll be back.
You can count on it.
Come on.
See if we can fool 'em.
We'll hide out in these mountains for a couple of days.
Right now, though, we better find us some grub.
That's cattle. I hear long time ago.
Thanks for telling me.
- Ow!
- What's the matter, Clint?
You talk to camels.
Tell her to get off my foot.
Move, Rosie.
You...
that's beef
for fort dorado, likely.
Bacon. I smell.
You'd like a little of that, huh?
Clint, we got nothing to eat.
Cheyenne quiet. I steal.
You've got to get over the idea that anytime you want anything, you can just go steal it.
We'll wait till they quiet down.
Then I'll steal the bacon.
Something wrong, boss? They're kinda spooky tonight.
I'm gonna get me some water.
I'm kinda thirsty myself.
Drink. Much obliged.
Yeah, they look kinda antsy, at that.
Well, it's funny.
No wind, no sand.
Nothing to make 'em spook.
We better keep an eye on 'em.
Rosie! What are you doing here?
Come on, Rosie.
Coosh. Coosh down.
Rosie, get down.
Get up. Get up. They're spookin'.
Get your horses quick.
Get up over there. Let's go.
Get down.
Pull 'em in, tom. Pull 'em in.
- Come on. Get 'em in.
- Oh, you dumb... Rosie. Easy.
What was that? I don't know.
Let's go, Rosie.
Let's go. Ho! Ho!
Let's go, Rosie. Go. No, Rosie.
Rosie, Rosie.
Rosie. Aw, Rosie, stop.
Rosie!
Whoa. Whoa!
Rosie, now you've gone far enough.
No, Rosie. No.
Whoa! Whoa!
Ow! Ow!
How many more?
I know about those.
How many more?
Not many, Clint.
What are you doing, Rosie? Get out of here.
Go on. Git. Git, Rosie.
Ow!
She's sorry, Clint.
Yeah, she's sorry.
Before getting mixed up with her, I should've stayed in the guardhouse...
And let 'em hang me,
peaceful-like.
That's all, Clint.
Carbolic. Like you said, it's gonna hurt you more than me.
Aah!
Won't fester.
Whoa, Rosie. Whoa.
I gotta get down, kid.
Take this. Here.
I've sat on campfires that were more comfortable.
Come on, Rosie.
Whoa.
Well, this looks like as good a place as any.
¶ What's that?
¶
¶ All in a wood
there grew a tree ¶
¶ the finest tree you ever did see ¶
¶ and the green leaves grew around and around ¶
¶ and the green leaves grew around ¶
- let's do it again, mama.
- Uh, all right.
One more chorus, and then we have to finish our packing.
¶ And on this tree there grew a limb ¶
¶ the finest limb you ever did see ¶
¶ the limb was on the tree ¶
¶ the tree was in the wood ¶ they don't have camels in new Mexico, do they, mama?
No, dear, they don't.
¶ And the green leaves grew around and around ¶ something's eating at our corn.
¶ And the green leaves grew around ¶
Judas priest, it is a camel.
But you said that... I know what I said.
Get back inside.
Oh, it's only
a little camel, mama.
Well, let's hope it's big enough to know what a shotgun is.
Git. Come on. Get out of my corn.
I said git!
Get out of here! Git! Git!
Don't go in the barn! Git!
Nothing to be afraid of, ma'am.
Who are you?
Howdy.
- What do you want?
- Well, we'd just like something to, uh...
well, to eat,
if you've got it, ma'am.
We-we'll be leaving here in a few days.
You can take everything then.
Oh, well, we'll be gone long before that.
Uh, are... is there anyone else here?
No. Just me and my little girl.
We sold everything, even the stock.
You can take anything you want.
Just leave us alone, please.
Well, there's no need to worry, ma'am.
We're camped nearby. Here.
No, we won't make any trouble.
Come on, mark.
Is he yours?
I never knew anyone who had a camel before.
They're here!
These are fresh this morning.
Well, thank you.
My name is Clint keyes, and this is mark.
Oh, I'm Doris mciver.
This is my daughter Martha.
- Are you with the army, Mr. Keyes?
- Well, not just now.
No, ma'am. Where's the camel?
- We left it back at camp.
- I don't understand.
I didn't know they had camels in the middle of new Mexico.
Well, Jeff Davis brought 'em over when he was secretary of war, for the desert troops.
- But yours is just a baby.
- We have the mother camel too.
A big camel?
Mama, can I see it, please?
- Mark would love to show it to her.
- Oh, well, I don't know.
It's all right. Mark loves
to show 'em off. Go on.
You said you were leaving. Maybe there's something I can do to help.
Oh, no, thank you.
They're sending a wagon out from town for us tomorrow morning.
We'll take the stagecoach from there.
We're going back to Colorado.
Mountain creek.
We came out here for my husband's health.
But it was no use.
It was too late.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.
Look, if you'll take these,
I'll cut some wood.
Oh, well, thank you.
Ah... oh, Mr. Keyes.
I notice you're limping.
Are you hurt?
Oh, I just had a little accident.
Well, I've had some nursing.
Would you like me to look at it?
No, ma'am. Oh, it'll be fine. Just fine.
Do you ride it? Sure.
Could I... could I ride it, please?
Could I ride the little one?
Why not?
- You're a girl.
- Well, she's the mother. She's a girl too.
All right. You ride.
Coosh, Rosie. Coosh.
Coosh down. Coosh. Coosh.
Coosh.
Coosh. Ready? Yeah.
Up, Rosie. Up.
Come on, Rosie.
Take this requisition to fort dorado.
They'll give you cash for your saddles and side arms...
And replace them horses we're taking there.
Fine. Ah, this man you're after... if it ain't a government secret, what'd he do?
Mutiny. Deserted up in Wyoming.
We caught up with him, took him to general crook's headquarters.
Busted out of the guardhouse there and attacked a noncommissioned officer.
Oh. And you say he was headed for Mexico?
Heading South, figures.
Well, may be.
But if it was me on the run,
I'd stay off that open desert.
Hole up in these mountains around here for a while.
You just may be right. Thanks.
Good luck, sergeant.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, say, there's more than enough fish...
If you and the boy'd care to stay for supper.
Well, no, than... I don't think we ought to.
That's very kind of you.
You mean you don't like fish?
Well, no, ma'am, it's not that.
It's just that...
Mark and I aren't exactly dressed, I haven't shaved... oh, well, there's plenty of time if you wanna shave.
Well, the truth is,
I just lost my razor.
Well, you're welcome to use my husband's, if you like.
Oh, well, you're already packed. I wouldn't wanna cause you any trouble.
Oh, no trouble.
Why don't you and mark sleep in the barn?
You'll be more comfortable there.
I'm obliged again, ma'am.
Come on, mark.
He depends on you a lot, doesn't he?
Oh, I guess.
But mostly he's just trying to use me to get to blue feather.
Are you going to take him?
I can't. I'm headed for Mexico.
Oh, I didn't know that.
With the boy?
No, ma'am.
What are you gonna do with him?
- That's my problem, I guess.
- You just can't leave him.
Well, I know that.
But he doesn't belong in Mexico...
Any more than he belongs in a tepee on a reservation.
What he needs is a home...
And a family.
It's a mite hard to tell whether a camel loves you or hates you.
- Either way they're ornery as sin.
- I love 'em.
I guess you gotta give them credit, though.
The heat doesn't bother 'em.
Neither does the cold.
The, uh, biggest ones
can travel...
Fifteen, sixteen Miles an hour, carrying a ton of weight.
They can outlast any horse.
Well, you certainly know a lot about camels, Mr. Keyes.
- Well, just hearsay.
- Oh.
Where... where are you going?
Camels.
First you say excuse me, and then you say thank you to Mrs. Mciver.
Go on. Say it.
Uh, Martha...
I just wanna talk to mark. I think you better go to bed now, dear.
- But it's early.
- Martha, we're leaving tomorrow.
Now, it's gonna be a very long, hard day.
I can't figure out what's eating mark.
Oh, he just feels out of place.
And a little jealous, I think.
I don't mean to pry, but is there some reason you can't take him to Mexico with you?
Yeah, there sure is.
Uh, Doris, I'm on the run.
- You mean somebody's after you?
- An army patrol.
Well.
What I did, I'm...
Not exactly proud of, but I'm not ashamed of it either.
Well, I'm sure what you did you thought was right.
Well, I guess
I better put these away.
Let me help you.
I don't know exactly how to say this, but, uh, you've been honest with me.
I'd like to explain to you about mark.
What about him?
Well, let's not pretend.
You've been hinting all day, trying to get me to say
I'd take the boy.
Well, you're right. I have.
You say what he needs is a home and a family.
A family. Not half a family.
I'd be less than human if my heart didn't go out to the boy.
But I can't listen to my heart. It's gonna be hard enough for Martha and me.
I'll teach a little piano and do a little nursing.
But a mother and daughter can always get along.
Why, oh, you figure I'm just trying to get shut of the boy.
Right now that's true.
If I had a choice...
- but you don't have a choice.
- I know that.
I can't keep him either.
I know that too.
Could I dry the dishes for you or something?
No. I... I'll just let 'em soak.
I think you better go out and see how he is.
Clint.
I'll tell you what I will do. I'll take mark up north with me tomorrow.
I'll do my level best
to find him a good family.
- That's the most I can promise.
- Well, nobody could ask for more than that.
I wanna thank you.
Well, I've got a busy day tomorrow.
Doris.
Doris, uh...
Doris, I forgot
to give this back to you.
Oh. Why don't you just keep it?
Oh, well, I can make good use of it. Thank you.
I must say, it's made quite an improvement.
Hmm? You.
Without the beard.
Good night, Doris.
Clint? Yeah?
I do wrong, huh, Clint?
Well, they're good people, mark.
You eat their food, a little thank you's not too much to ask.
It's one of those things you'll have to learn.
But you not mad at me now?
No.
No. We're friends, aren't we?
You good friend, Clint.
I not forget.
Mark.
I have something to tell you.
- You're going to come with us.
- Shh.
Mark!
Clint would've taken you, if he could.
But he thought it was better if you stayed with us for a little while.
You'll love Colorado. We're gonna ride on the stagecoach.
Mark, let me talk to you.
Please, mark, listen.
Martha and I both
want you to go with us.
You can stay with us as long as you like.
Mark.
Wait.
Please.
Please.
Cheyenne don't cry.
Mark.
Where's Clint keyes?
Keyes?
Schrader, search the house.
Dixon, you take the barn.
I said, where's keyes?
I'm gonna find out, ma'am.
That's my job.
- Anything?
- Uh-uh.
- Give me the boy.
- He's done nothing wrong.
If you won't tell me about keyes, he'll have to.
Leave him alone.
Mr. Keyes isn't here.
He left last night.
Which way did he go?
I don't know.
I didn't see him leave.
You might as well tell me the rest of it.
Um, well, he talked about north, I think.
Try South.
Jimmy wolf!
Any signs? Camel tracks.
This way.
Get after him. Much obliged for your help, ma'am.
Giddap! Come on!
Mark!
Martha! Martha!
Martha, it's time to go!
Mama, I can't find mark
anywhere.
I know, but you've been looking and calling for a long time now, and we really have to go now.
That's right, ma'am.
We better hustle. You're gonna miss your stage.
We just can't leave mark, mama.
I don't want to leave him any more than you do, Martha, but he must be Miles away from here by now.
He's not. He's still here.
I know he is.
Martha, he'll find Mr. Keyes.
I'm sure he will.
Now, come on.
Now, up we go.
-  Giddap!
- Mark! Mark!
Good-bye, mark!
Bye!
Bye, mark!
Bye!
Rosie, ho! Ho!
Rosie, you wanna be the only hopeless camel in the world, you just keep that up.
Coosh! Coosh! Coosh! Coosh!
Steady now. Easy, girl. Ho.
Ho, girl.
Up, Rosie. Up.
Hyah! Hup! Hup! Hyah!
Ho.
Well, Rosie, it's the end of the line.
Whoa, Rosie.
All right, Rosie, hightail it out of here.
Rosie, it's what you've always wanted. Now, go.
Rosie, don't go gettin' sentimental on me now.
I haven't got that much time.
Now get outta here. Go on.
All right, Rosie!
Hyah, hyah, hyah!
Camel. This way.
Looks like we're driving him down towards the desert.
Come, thirsty. This way.
Carbolic?
Sure bet you didn't expect him to trap himself...
In no box canyon, huh, sarge?
Shut up, Dixon. You just be ready when he flushes him out of there.
What'd you see from the rim?
He's not there.
What do you mean, he's not there?
Where is he?
We follow empty camel.
Follow empty camel.
Dixon, go get that camel.
We're headin' back. What do we need that old camel for, sarge?
Because we haven't got but four horses.
Or would you rather ride double with keyes?
Move!
Tell schrader he can quit lookin' for keyes.
Help! Ohh!
Rope him, you dumb John!
Come back!
Hold on, Dixon!
Whoa! Whoa!
Help us, schrader! Stop!
Whoa! Stop! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Ohh!
I wish I'd have let you rode double with keyes.
All I was tryin' to do was find you a family.
That's nothing
to get sore about.
I only promised to take you as far as the mountains, remember?
You left me.
Sure, I left you.
I left you with Mrs. Mciver so you could live regular,
maybe go to school and make somethin' out of yourself.
I'll fix you somethin' to eat.
Not hungry.
Why didn't you go with 'em, mark?
I go to blue feather.
You take me now?
Now, you know I can't do that, not with that patrol still on my tail.
I'd lose too many Miles.
I got good idea, Clint.
Yeah? What kind of idea?
You take me to Cheyenne. They hide you.
They my friends.
The Cheyenne hide me?
Kid, neither one of us could get within spittin' distance of that reservation.
Set one foot inside that fort, and they'd grab you just like they did at fort dorado.
To them, you're... you're just a white captive kidnapped by Indians, and to the Indians, you're nothin' but trouble, and they know it.
Now, mark, uh, blue feather... blue feather won't take you back because she can't.
You gotta understand that.
Son, I...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I know it's tough.
It's not like you're gonna be alone.
You'll be with me.
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I know I left you at the farm, but I explained about that.
We always got along.
We're partners, ain't we?
'Spose we can go on down to Mexico together.
We can make it down there.
No.
You don't want me.
I go to Cheyenne.
Now, wait a minute, kid.
I'm tired of arguing with you.
All right, you want your Indians?
I'll show you how to get there, and I hope you like what you get.
Here's our Mountain right here.
You go on the other side of it.
When you get over there, you go north three, four days...
Till you hit the Canadian river, and it's gonna be high this time of year.
When you hit it, you turn east, maybe seven, eight days.
And right here is your reservation,
long knives and all.
We got you surrounded, keyes!
Rosie.
Hold it, keyes!
All right, corporal.
This time... I give the party.
¶
Troopers, fall in!
Dress right! Dress!
Ready, front!
Parade... dress!
Whoa! Ten-hut!
Take 'em out, sergeant.
Forward!
Welcome back, sir.
How'd the maneuvers go?
Lieutenant, what is that thing doing on my parade ground?
It's a gallows, sir.
What I want to know, lieutenant, is why is it there and who authorized its construction.
A patrol under sergeant...
Raines brought in a prisoner. He has orders from general crook... well, lieutenant, you bring that sergeant and his patrol to my office.
Yes, sir. And on the double, lieutenant!
What are you, sergeant, some sort of traveling hangman?
No, sir. My orders are to capture the prisoner and execute him, signed by general crook, sir.
Your orders also refer to the usual courtesies extended a commanding officer.
I didn't know when you'd be back, sir.
Nobody here could tell me.
You simply took over my command.
No, sir. I was just following my orders.
Where is the prisoner?
- I can get him for you, sir.
-  Sergeant!
When I need your help,
I'll tell you.
I asked you where he is.
He's in the guardhouse, sir.
Have the prisoner brought in here.
You're corporal Clinton keyes?
Yes, sir.
You took part in McKenzie's raid on dull knife's village? Yes, sir.
You were convicted of mutiny and desertion.
That's all it says here.
I'd like to know what happened.
There were 173 lodges in dull knife's village.
We destroyed them all.
Man next to me started shooting the women, so I hit him with my rifle.
When you say a man,
you mean another trooper?
Yes, sir. Then what did you do?
I tried to help the braves with their families.
Against your officers and your fellow troopers?
If you mean did I shoot at them, no, sir.
- But you did mutiny.
-  That's what they called it.
Corporal, you seem to feel that each man has a right to consult his conscience...
And decide which orders he will obey...
And which he will disobey.
Take him out.
Sergeant, I want this execution finished as quickly as possible.
There will be no formalities.
No members of my command will participate in any way whatsoever.
You are solely responsible, sergeant. You understand?
- Sir, my orders state that...
- Dismissed, sergeant.
I'm, uh, glad you asked for me, but I wanted you to know that
I'd have come in any event.
Uh, now, is there anything...
I know all that, reverend.
Uh, reverend, do you remember a boy that was brought here...
With some Cheyenne by the name of mark?
Mark? Yes, I do.
Is he all right? Where is he?
Well, that's what I don't know.
By now he should be halfway across the desert, if he's still heading towards the reservation.
- Looking for blue feather.
- Yeah.
How do you know about the boy?
Oh, I ran onto him north of here.
We were sort of partners for a while till we had a little set-to.
I guess I sort of forgot which one was the man and which one was the boy.
Chaplain, what I want to ask is a favor.
Anything, if I can.
Well, if the boy makes it to the reservation, the army will grab him for sure.
They'll need a home for him.
I ran onto this widow woman up in the mountains where we stopped.
She had a little daughter.
They were headed toward Colorado.
Place called Mountain creek.
Her name is Doris mciver.
Now?
Just a minute.
Uh, one minute, please.
I want you to know that I'll do everything I can to find that boy.
Thank you.
You... would you, uh, like me to go up there with you?
It's funny.
I memorized whole books of words to say at a time like this.
I just can't remember any of them.
I've had to live with this for a long time, chaplain.
I won't need any words.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hold on!
Look out! Run on the porch!
Get out of the way!
Get keyes!
- Clint!
- Here, mark!
- Let's go, mark!
-  Hey, you! Come here!
Go, Rosie!
Let's get after him!
Gotcha! You're not gettin' away this time! Come on!
G'yup there! G'yup!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Hyah!
Come on! Come on! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Come on, Rosie! Hyah! Hyah!
Move! Let's go!
Ho.
Sergeant, that camel's faster than the horses.
Never gonna catch 'em this way.
Gimme that Springfield!
On the double!
Missed.
Let's get back to the fort.
Rose, come on, now.
You can outrun 'em. Come on, don't quit on me now, Rosie.
Come on, Rosie. Don't quit...
All right, Rosie. Easy.
Okay, okay, girl.
Okay. I ain't going anyplace.
It's all right, girl.
I know he's in the guardhouse, John.
I ordered him put there.
If you think you're taking him back to the chapel, you can forget it.
No. Only temporarily, sir.
Now, I have an idea...
John, you... excuse me, captain.
It's urgent.
I need fresh horses and more men.
Sergeant... he outrun us, sir, but he can't keep runnin'.
When he stops to rest, why, we'll jump him.
There'll be no more horses.
No more men.
Your manhunt is over.
Sir, you read general crook's orders.
General crook's orders call for the hanging of corporal keyes.
A noose was placed around his neck, the trap was sprung, the man was hung.
It is my personal view, sergeant, that corporal keyes...
Has more than paid for his misdeeds, such as they were.
I have no intention of hanging a man twice for the same crime.
Dismissed, sergeant.
Tell him I won't give him any trouble.
I came to tell you you're free.
I don't think I understand.
Well, the captain says you've been hung once already anyway.
He's sending that patrol back onto general crook.
That's mighty good news, reverend.
Real good news.
Uh, reverend, what about mark?
Oh, he's fine.
I brought your things.
Look, if the cavalry doesn't want me, is there any reason why I can't see the boy?
Well, he's a ward of the army.
I'm supposed to, uh, find a home for him.
I told you about that Mrs. Mciver.
The home he really wants is with you, only he's afraid that you don't want him.
That ain't true. I offered to take him with me once. He knows that.
Yes, but was that because you wanted him or because you just had no choice?
Well, things were different then.
Look, how do you truly feel about the boy now?
Well, I don't know if anybody will trust me with my record and all, but if I could have the boy, reverend, well, you bet I want him.
We do good, huh, Clint? Yeah, you did just great. Just great.
Well, I guess I'd better be gettin' on back.
This, uh, arrangement
was my decision.
I might have some explaining to do to the captain.
Thank you, chaplain.
Thanks for everything.
That's all right.
She's dead.
Yeah, well... she wasn't much to look at.
Pure impossible to get along with, but...
She saved both our lives more than once.
You know, there near the end,
I think she...
Even kind of enjoyed hatin' me.
Well, maybe a little anyway, huh?
Clint. Yeah?
When you take me to see blue feather?
Well, how about next summer?
We'll go visit her on the reservation, the both of us.
After we go to Mexico?
Yeah, well, Mexico, uh... you know, seein' how
I'm a free man,
I've been thinking maybe we could, um, oh, run up maybe to...
Mountain creek, Colorado, someplace like that instead.
What do you think?
All right, come on.
Well, looks like we're back to ridin' double again.
Come on, thirsty.
- Did I miss anything?
- No, he's doing the same old thing.
[Higgins] Lufkin, why is it that every time we have a budget meeting,
- you stir up trouble?
- [Lufkin] I'm not trying to stir up trouble.
I'm just trying to get what I need, so we can have a decent lab.
[Higgins] I think you've got what you need.
Need I remind you, it was just last year that we bought 10 new
Bunsen burners for that lab.
We've got to draw the line somewhere.
This can't go on forever.
But our students have to experiment.
Be creative.
That's what science is all about.
Creative, my foot.
You're talking about this bunch out there being creative. That's impossible.
[Lufkin] You're being unfair, Dean Higgins.
Suppose people had taken that attitude about Thomas Edison?
We're not talking about people like Edison.
We're talking about people like Dexter Riley.
Believe me, Dexter Riley is no Thomas Edison.
[Dexter] Nobody ever said he was!
Of course, nobody said he was.
That would be a ridiculous thing to say...
No, Lufkin, I think you better forget about your course in creative lab.
Just stick with the old conventional systems.
Burn the sulfur, make clouds, smell up the place, like you do.
[Lufkin] Now, really, Dean Higgins.
That was good enough for the '40s, but today, science...
Why is it that every time we have a meeting, they're out there?
Listening to something?
[Buzzer]
- They're just having a little gathering.
- I don't like little gatherings.
They make me nervous. I don't even like...
Yes, Winifred?
Who? Yes, I'll talk to him, Winifred.
That'll be all today, gentlemen.
That was even duller than usual.
But you gotta listen.
You never know what might come up.
Yes, Helwig, did you find out anything?
Yes, I've been watching them.
They've been bugging your office.
[Higgins] They've been bugging my office?
- What?
- [Higgins] Are you sure?
What'd he say?
We'll find out! Wait a minute.
I should've known.
I wonder where they hid that thing.
- He's on to us.
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta do something in a hurry.
- Let's get moving.
Behind the books, that's where they'd hide it.
They're worried about the establishment.
Hello? I'll show them what the establishment really is.
Soon as I find the evidence,
I'll expel them all.
Tuition or no tuition, I'll get a federal grant. I don't need them.
Nothing under here.
No! My homework!
Anything wrong, Dean Higgins?
No, nothing's wrong.
You need an electrician or anything?
No, I don't need an electrician.
You don't have to snap my head off.
If I wanted an electrician,
I'd have called one in the first place.
Don't they ever clean this thing? I don't know what I pay that janitor for anyway.
Excuse me, could you show me my attendance file in history?
Mr. Baines says I missed half my classes and I don't believe it.
I don't think I missed any.
- The name?
- Schuylar, Richard Schuylar.
Says here you've been absent every Thursday.
You mean it's on Thursdays, too?
I only thought it was on Tuesdays.
No wonder all those epics seemed to roll along so fast.
I think I got the answer.
If I flunk it this semester,
I'll go on Thursdays next semester and pick up the stuff I missed.
Thanks, Mrs. Kesley, you'll never know how much you helped me!
Dean Higgins, do you mind if I change your flowers?
No, I don't. I've got more important things on my mind.
[Higgins] Wait!
I knew it. It's those flowers.
All right, Dexter Riley,
I know you're in there.
Imagine it, sir. If one of our own students could actually win the Forsythe Award!
- With this bunch, that's impossible.
- Good morning, Dean Higgins.
- But Dean, it's $50,000 this year.
- Really? $50,000?
Morning, Dean Higgins.
Young Druffle seems to have come up with something very promising.
He's one of our honor students. What's he doing here with a crowd like this?
Good morning, Dean.
There's another beaut, that Schuylar.
Right this way, sir.
Well, Druffle...
I thought we might give Dean Higgins a progress report on your experiment.
Certainly. Good morning.
Morning.
Actually, my work with bumble bees is based on a very simple theory.
See, when you consider the mass of the body of the bee, the drag quotient far outmeasures the foil efficiency and the lift field.
- Ergo, it's fairly safe to say...
- Thank you, Druffle.
Morning, Dean.
Howdy ho, Dean.
- Tell them not to touch me.
- Please.
I know what Tinkertoys are when
I see them, but what is this monstrosity?
- What is this?
- It's an invention of my own.
I can imagine.
People have been trying to figure out the problem of invisibility.
- I didn't know that was a problem.
- Things have changed.
A lot has happened since Einstein split the atom.
This looks like one of them.
It looks complicated, but actually it's very simple once you understand it.
I'm not sure I care to understand it.
First of all, you have to read
Bersokoff's book on quantum mechanics.
- I do. And who was Bersokoff?
- You don't know him?
That's funny, he was a very famous
18th century Russian scientist.
He was the man who developed the theory,
"If we could prevent reflection..."
Let me show you.
If we could prevent reflection by... bending light waves around objects with a non-reflectable liquid, we could make those objects invisible.
That was his theory?
Making objects invisible?
- Yes, sir.
- That's idiotic.
No, sir, it's a very sound theory.
If it's so sound, how come he could never make it work?
- Who?
- The Russian! Whoever...
You mean Bersokoff.
Unfortunately, his career was cut short.
I didn't know that. His career...
What happened?
- What happened to him?
- They threw him into an insane asylum.
They threw him into an insane asylum?
And you're working on his theory?
Yeah.
Don't you exercise any control whatsoever around here?
You come to me and ask me for money to buy expensive equipment, so that nitwit kid can work on a theory that some Russian proposed,
- over 200 years ago?
- Wait a minute, sir!
We may not agree with the Russians politically, we may not even like them, but as scientists, don't you think we ought to raise ourselves above these petty prejudices?
Scientists? I'm talking about a nut they had to lock up over 200 years ago!
Dean, I'm sorry!
Dean, I'm sorry.
I don't how it happened.
These lunatics are trying to kill me.
Wait a minute.
- I've had enough.
- What about...
[students] You don't understand.
[Thunder]
[Thunder]
[Glass shattering]
I must be going crazy, but the guy in that car looked like A.J. Arno.
It couldn't be him.
He's in jail.
All right, move away from the car.
Come on, move.
What's the matter with you?
Leave them alone.
They're not doing any harm.
Boys, don't pay any attention to him.
- Hi, kids. Nice to see you.
- Hi, Mr. Arno.
What's the matter?
You seem surprised to see me.
- We thought you were in jail.
- Oh, that. That was a mistake.
You know, the police, judges, they all make mistakes.
But I forgive them. I don't hold grudges.
Dean Higgins, nice to see you.
- [Higgins] Always a pleasure to see you.
- [Arno] Thank you.
What's going on around here?
Arno took over the mortgage on the college.
He told Dean Higgins that if he can't make the payment in June,
- to make it whenever he could.
- Sure doesn't sound like Arno.
That's why Dean Higgins is walking around on airs.
It's the first time he hasn't had to worry about money.
But I don't understand it.
That guy's a crook.
Crook or no crook, he's interested in higher education.
He's already dreamed up improvements for the school.
That's where he is now.
Dean Higgins is showing him around.
I have to run off to a teacher's meeting.
Anything else you need?
No, Professor, I'm just gonna work on my experiment for a while.
Holy smoke.
The whole thing's burned out.
How come mine and nobody else's?
Oh, boy.
Oh, no.
Gotta be in there somewhere.
That stuff must eat everything alive.
I'll bet I gotta replace everything.
[Tapping]
A vector is any quantity such as a force of velocity that has direction as well as amount.
I've done it.
I've really done it.
- Hi.
- Hi, Dexter.
What have you done to your glasses?
You look ridiculous.
I've done it!
[Schuylar] Your fingers!
- You better get to the hospital right away.
- I'll call an ambulance.
There's nothing to be worried about.
You see, my fingers are all there.
- They're just invisible.
- Invisible?
I don't know how it works, but it works.
Let me show you.
Now this is the stuff that does it.
It's incredible.
But the main thing is,
I can make myself invisible.
Can you imagine? Look!
Look, human flesh, invisible!
You mean, you just stuck your hand in that stuff and your fingers became invisible?
That's all there is to it.
Look, you try it.
- Me?
- Why not?
I don't think I better.
I mean, I'm not much on this science business.
In fact, I don't even know what I'm doing in this class.
- Schuylar, there's nothing to be afraid of.
- I'm not afraid.
Then you do it.
Look at 'em!
They're gone, but they're there.
This is incredible.
Dexter, how do we make our fingers visible again?
- That shouldn't be any problem.
- Are you sure?
Of course!
Look, it's just a solution.
It should come right off.
There, see.
- Give me that towel.
- Don't panic, Debbie.
I'm not panicking.
Dexter, what have you done to me?
What are you people doing in here?
- Nothing.
- I wouldn't call it nothing.
I mean, this thing has quite a history.
You've probably heard of the famous
Russian scientist, Bersokoff.
Nobody wants to hear anything about Bersokoff.
Now, Mr. Arno, we've got a simply marvelous... experiment over here by one of our honor students, Druffle.
He's working on a very interesting theory on bumble bees.
You see, according to all the laws of aerodynamics when you consider the mass of their body to their wingspread, they shouldn't fly at all.
- Then how come they do?
- I don't know.
That's what Druffle's trying to find out.
What a day to bring Mr. Arno up here.
You certainly have quite a view from here.
It's an entirely different perspective.
Do you mind if my architect takes a look at it?
Your architect? You think he'd like it?
That'd be wonderful.
It's quite a view indeed.
Goodbye, young lady. Son?
- Goodbye, Hector.
- Dexter.
Yeah, Dexter.
What is the matter with everybody's right hand around here?
They've been working on Dexter's experiment and they might have got something on them.
If they've got something on them, why don't they wash them?
I never thought of that.
It did it.
Water takes it off!
It's amazing.
Dean Higgins, you're a genius.
You know, it just doesn't figure.
Arno gets out of prison and picks up the mortgage on this place.
Next thing you know, he wants to bring over his architect and remodel.
A.J. Arno just doesn't do favors for people.
Yeah. What was so interesting out this window?
I don't know.
He's sure up to something.
And we're gonna find out what it is.
I know, I know!
This afternoon you said you'd do it.
How come you changed your mind?
This afternoon it was just my hand. Tonight it's all of me.
But it's the same principle.
When we're through, we wet you down and you'll be yourself again.
But it's when I'm not myself that I don't like it.
It's too late to back out on me now.
I need you.
Oh, no!
- Wait a minute, don't forget the camera.
- [Dexter] Thanks. Come on, let's go.
- Be careful, you guys!
- [Dexter] We will, don't worry.
- [Schuylar] I don't like this at all.
- [Dexter] I don't either,
- but we have to find out what Arno's up to.
- How do you know he's up to anything?
Because he's a crook. And he bought the mortgage on Midfield College.
Why would a crook like Arno want to do that?
[Schuylar] I don't know, don't ask me.
Don't ask me anything at all.
Why not?
Because if I knew anything,
I wouldn't be here in the first place.
- [Schuylar] Did you hear that?
- [Dexter] What?
- [Schuylar] That slushing sound.
- [Dexter] You hear it too?
[Dexter] It stopped now.
[Schuylar] Wait a minute, my shoes are visible!
[Dexter] That's what the slushing sound was.
You must've stepped in some water somewhere.
[Schuylar] This looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Schuylar, will you quit playing around and come on?
Okay.
- [Schuylar] Good, the door's locked.
- [Dexter] Look out! Somebody's coming.
Mr. Arno, leaving his tennis shoes out to be shined.
Must be going nuts, or something.
[Groaning]
Ow!
[Dexter] I'll hit the filing cabinet, you look in his desk.
[Schuylar] His desk is locked.
I guess I just better look around.
- [Dexter] Medfield.
- [Schuylar] That would be under "M."
[Dexter] I know what it would be under.
Medfield College.
That's it.
[Schuylar] There's another room over here.
- What's in it?
- Some sort of model.
[Dexter] "Dear Mr. Arno,
In regard to your inquiry,
"the law of 1912 permitting gambling
"on the Medfield property is still in effect."
[Dexter] I've really stumbled onto something here.
[Schuylar] I found something, too.
It's a model of the school. Evidently,
Arno's planning on changing it a lot.
- It has the craziest football field ever.
- What's so crazy about it?
[Schuylar] It has no goal post and there's a lake in the middle of it.
[Dexter] Never heard of that!
- What are you talking about?
- See what I mean!
[Dexter] That's not a football field anymore, that's a dog track.
[Schuylar] A dog track?
[Dexter] He's turning the college into a gambling joint.
Look where the gym used to be.
Arno's Golden Horseshoe Club.
[Schuylar] The casino is replacing the library.
[Dexter] I knew that guy was up to something.
"Arno Town."
Wait'll Dean Higgins gets a load of this.
Is he gonna change his opinion about A.J. Arno!
[Schuylar] Excuse me!
[Gun firing]
Wait, you!
Come back here, whoever you are!
- How'd it go?
- [Dexter] Move over, Arno saw us!
But that's impossible.
He couldn't see you.
[Dexter] Will you come on? He's after us.
But I'll look silly sitting over here all by myself.
[Schuylar] Will you get us out of here?
So you have the pictures, but how do you expect to see Dean
Higgins in the condition you're in?
[Dexter] We're not gonna see him tonight.
We'll wait till tomorrow when we're ourselves again.
[Debbie] If it's so important, why don't you see him tonight?
[Dexter] Because he's not here.
He's up at the Friendly Sons of the Forest Convention in Riverton.
The kids in that car can hear you.
[Dexter] Just play it like nothing's wrong.
It'll be okay.
Hi, gang.
The zoning laws of 1912?
Casinos?
Dog racing?
Medfield College, a gambling town?
If Arno's got plans like these, he'll foreclose on that mortgage for sure.
I'll bet that's what he had on his mind all the time.
There's always the Forsythe Award.
That's a pipe dream, Lufkin.
Medfield wasn't even invited.
They can't do that to us.
We have it all locked up.
I thought Druffle's bumble bee experiment would open the eyes of the scientific world.
I wasn't talking about Druffle.
I was talking about me.
- You! What do you have?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- I'd have to show you.
- Show me!
I can't. I'd rather wait till the day of the contest with Arno, and everything.
It's such a big discovery that if word got out, there's no telling what might happen!
How could word get out?
Are you insinuating I'd shoot off my mouth?
No, sir. We're going to win the award.
We just want you to trust us, that's all.
Trust you? This college is going to be taken over by a crook like Arno and you want me to trust you, you big lummox?
- Just a minute, don't start yelling at me.
- Take it easy.
I didn't want to be in on this in the first place!
If we don't get into the contest, we will lose the school.
Forsythe is staying at the Medfield Inn.
Why don't you give him a call?
I'll bet you can talk us right back into the contest.
You think I could do it?
Sure, sir, you can handle that easily.
You can do that stuff really good.
I suppose I could do something, as a matter of fact.
Winifred, would you get me Mr. Forsythe at the Medfield Inn?
When you get right down to it, there's no reason for him to ignore us.
It's not as though we were a hick school.
Besides I've got a pretty good reputation in this part of the country.
[Winifred] Mr. Forsythe on the line.
Lufkin, grab the other phone and see how these things are handled.
[Forsythe] Hello?
Hello, Mr. Forsythe.
This is Dean Higgins,
...from Medfield College.
Yeah, Higgins. Blasted!
I beg your pardon?
Nothing, I'm sorry.
I just missed a put I should've made.
You can't put unless you really concentrate.
No, I've always said that.
- You're a golfer?
- Yes!
- He's no golfer.
- Good, what can I do for you?
It's about the Forsythe Award.
I'm sorry we're dropping the smaller colleges this year.
Frankly, it just became too much of a waste of time.
We're not a waste of time.
We're small but we have an excellent science department.
Yes, I know, but...
If you would just give me a chance,
I would meet you anywhere, anytime.
Maybe I can fit you in.
I'm playing golf this morning at 10:00 with Collingsgood at Thunder Ridge.
Why don't you join us and we can chat between holes?
Is that Dean Collingsgood from State?
Yeah, what's the matter?
Nothing. That'll be wonderful.
Okay, first tee, 10:00, balls in the air.
See you then.
Yes, I'll be there.
Thank you very much, Mr. Forsythe.
- I've got to go change.
- You're gonna play golf with Forsythe?
- What's the matter with that?
- You don't play golf.
Yes, I do. I played just yesterday afternoon at Swenson's with Bertha.
Tough course, too. You gotta hit the ball up a ramp and right through a little castle.
- That's miniature golf.
- It can't be that much different.
Don't worry about me.
Besides it's the only chance we've got.
Looks like we got our work cut out for us today.
What do you mean?
I can handle the game, but you better be his caddy.
- I may need some help out there.
- I don't know how to be a caddy.
That's all right. Dean Higgins doesn't know how to play golf either.
[Forsythe] That's cutting into the ball,
Collingsgood.
- Good shot.
- I was hoping for a little more distance.
It was straight, anyway.
[Collingsgood] What a shot, Timothy!
I'll take it. You're up, Higgins.
We better do something.
Let's let him hit one and we'll see.
You don't have any little castles here,
I noticed.
Isn't that Dean Higgins down there?
I didn't know he played golf.
I don't think he does.
Maybe that was just a mistake.
Let's give him another chance.
He might be better than we think.
I guess I got under that one a little too much. It went...
Just another swing,
I'll be out there with you fellas.
[Forsythe] That poor old man!
He's worse than we think.
Come on.
Hey, I might be able to use this.
Good luck.
- Are you all right, Mr. Reeves?
- Yes, I think so.
Boy, that fellow can sure hit a long ball.
That ball didn't come from over there.
It came from over there!
I don't know what happened there.
I just sort of hit the edge of the club.
No offense, but people are waiting to play through. We don't want to hold them up.
Why don't you just take a nice, hot shower and call it a day?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I'm just getting warmed up.
Schuylar, which club do I use now?
In view of what I've seen so far,
I don't know what to tell you.
Of course you don't!
Just give me any club.
Next time, I'll pay $10 and get a real caddy.
Give me a second, gentlemen.
I'll knock it out there.
We'll be on our way.
Let's face it.
Higgins just isn't a golfer.
I could've told you that.
The man's an impostor. Always has been.
He has no more business being on a golf course than...
Look!
That was a good one.
Remember that club.
Seems to break to the left.
Hurry up, will you?
We can't wait all day.
I want to get this put.
If I do, I'll get my par.
Great Scott!
It does break to the left.
Your shot, Collingsgood.
[Dexter] Now, watch this!
[Dexter] What's a nice ball like you doing in a place like this?
We'll give them something to talk about this time.
Perfect!
The farmer in the dell
The farmer in the dell
Hi-ho, the dairy-o,
The farmer in the dell
[laughs]
It's got to be around here some place.
Maybe it trickled up on the green.
Don't be silly.
You could see it if it did.
Besides, you can't hit every ball on the green.
[Dexter] Schuylar, look in the hole.
- Huh?
- [Dexter] Look in the hole!
[Schuylar] Look in the hole.
Why didn't I think of that!
I'm gonna look in the hole.
Of course, in the hole.
There's no other place.
There's that little Dickens!
- That's amazing! Absolutely amazing!
- Isn't it?
If I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it.
That Higgins is a golfing phenomenon.
Do you know he's had two holes and one on the front nine?
What I don't understand is why nobody ever asked him to join the club?
Nobody ever thought he had that kind of talent.
It's still impossible to believe.
- [Dexter] I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
How come you said that?
- What?
- That's okay.
You just bumped into me and said you were sorry. So I said, "That's okay."
But I didn't bump into you.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
I believe that's a two.
That's all right.
I'll give you that one.
He's already had four holes in one.
Do you think he could make another one?
Would you keep these people quiet?
This is very difficult.
People, please be quiet.
Dean Higgins is trying to concentrate.
[Ball bouncing off trees]
That's amazing, Higgins!
I can't believe it!
- Schuylar, what club should we use here?
- I think you ought to use this one, sir.
- You've had a lot of luck with it.
- Good thinking.
[Dexter] It's not over yet. Get out of there.
That's one of the most incredible rounds of golf I've ever seen.
Thank you, but with all the excitement, we forgot to mention Medfield's participation in the Forsythe Award.
Consider yourself entered.
A man who plays golf like you, how can we keep your school out?
Let me buy you a drink.
I want to introduce you to some of the members.
I don't as a rule, but we mustn't forget Collingsgood.
- Come along, Edgar!
- He can change his shoes in the car.
[Whistling]
[Water running]
Boss, I got the car...
What's the matter? Is something wrong?
- I think I must be going nuts.
- That's too bad, boss.
If you weren't my sister's son,
I'd fire you!
- I always forget you're my uncle.
- Take your hands off me.
I'm sorry I reminded you.
[Buzzer]
Winifred, if that's somebody else calling to congratulate me would you just thank them and take their names?
Who? I'll talk to him, yes.
It's Collins, from TeleSports.
Hello, Mr. Collins.
Thank you. It was just one of those days, where I put everything together.
Challenge Golf?
I don't know.
For how much?
Yes, you can count on me!
I'll be there today!
Thank you.
Winifred, would you call the airport and get me two tickets to Oceanview City?
Then, get a hold of Richard Schuylar for me.
You know that $50,000 mortgage payment we're worried about?
We don't have to worry about that anymore.
Hey, Druffle.
Where is everybody?
They're all out at the airport to see Dean Higgins off.
Where's he going?
Up to Oceanview.
He's playing in a golf tournament.
Winner take all.
Dean Higgins is gonna play golf against pros?
Incidentally, Schuylar wants you to get to the airport as soon as you can.
- He says things are rather desperate.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
Listen, what time does the plane leave?
- I think he said 10:30.
- Oh, no!
[Tires screeching]
And furthermore, I want it to be known, that all the proceeds from my golf victory today will go to Medfield College.
[Cheering]
- I wonder where Dexter is.
- Will you forget about Dexter?
Oh, no! What's he doing out there?
I think he wants us to stop the plane, sir.
- What for?
- He probably wants to get on board.
Don't you think maybe we ought to let him?
Of course not!
What do we need with him? Sit back.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first tee.
The trouble on this hole are some trees on the left fairway, but I don't think any of our golfers will have any trouble with that.
And here is Billy Casper, former Open champ, considered by many to be one of the best putters on the tour.
Trying for the $50,000 first prize.
[Higgins] Billy.
You mind? This is a little something that could help you. I picked this up.
He seems to be getting a few tips from Dean Higgins, involving the hands.
Wrist, you know what I mean? Wrist.
[Reporter] That's a beauty.
Higgins' tips obviously helped.
He's well away from the trouble.
Out about 270 yards.
And here's controversial Dave Hill.
Former Vardon trophy winner.
A beautiful shot.
He's right out there with Mr. Casper.
It'll be interesting to see how Dean Higgins' unorthodox swing holds up against this competition.
There's a pro!
That's an interesting shot.
I wonder what Dean Higgins has in mind.
I don't have time for interviews now.
Maybe later.
[Reporter] We're watching Dean Higgins in his first attempt at getting out of a trap.
He's entering the trap now, assuming his stance.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're waiting for some word on Dean Higgins.
Here are our pros
Dave Hill and Billy Casper.
- Where is he?
- We're not sure.
- You mean, he's still out there on a safari?
- I'm afraid so.
Our mobile crew thinks they've located him.
- He's around the 12th fairway.
- Beautiful.
Jim, come in.
Tom, I've spotted his caddy by a thicket on the left side.
Dean Higgins must be in it because the caddy sure is passing in a lot of clubs.
It's out! Right...
Which club now?
I think you better use the one you got.
It's the straightest one we have left.
We're sorry Dean Higgins can't be with us at this moment, but something unprecedented has happened.
We seem to have lost him.
But in the meanwhile, we want to thank Dave Hill and Billy...
Just a moment.
Yes, Jim.
We seem to have found him.
He's having trouble on the 13th hole.
If you ask me, I think we ought to throw it up there.
I didn't ask you.
Besides we're on TV.
You want people to think I can't shoot my way out of a little difficulty?
Where'd it go?
But I'm getting all wet!
What do you think is happening to me?
Just stay away!
I think you better turn around!
[Screaming]
Crazy, isn't it? How could a guy be so good one week and so lousy the next?
There's something weird going on around here, all right.
I'll lay you odds if you keep your eye on Dexter Riley and that creative lab, you'll find out what it is.
Not one word.
I don't want to hear a single word.
You, take those things and get rid of 'em.
Yes, sir.
[Higgins] Come in!
- All right, what is it?
- It's about the Forsythe Award, sir.
It's an idea of what Druffle plans to prove with his bumble bee experiments.
Of course, he will use real bees.
And here's more or less of an outline of what he's trying to prove.
Well, it looks very promising.
I think he's definitely on the brink of a solution.
I hope so, Lufkin, because frankly,
I think that Druffle is our last chance.
[Buzzer]
Yes, Winifred?
[Winifred] I hate to disturb you, but could Druffle come in and see you?
Of course he can.
She lets every nincompoop in this school in here, then she hesitates to let a real scholar like Druffle in.
[Knocking]
Yes, come in.
Mr. Lufkin has been explaining to me...
Who are you?
[Mumbling]
- What did he say?
- I don't know.
[Mumbles] The bees...
What's that again?
It's Druffle.
"Bitten by bumble bees.
Doctor says I'm allergic to them.
"Will have to abandon experiment.
Am taking pills. May be ready next year."
We're through!
There goes the Forsythe Award.
There'll be no mortgage payment.
Medfield is down the drain...
Not quite, sir.
There's... Dexter Riley.
- He still thinks he has something.
- He certainly does.
A mental condition, with that invisibility experiment.
Dean Higgins, who else have we got?
Nobody.
But Dexter Riley...
[Dexter] Okay, the first thing we have to do is get everything organized.
[Schuylar] Nobody seems to think we have a chance at winning this thing, but Debbie, you and I, and I guess maybe Lufkin.
You didn't happen to talk to him, did you?
[Dexter] Lufkin didn't seem too enthused, but we can't pay attention to that.
After this showing,
Medfield'll win the award money and you and I'll be written up in every chemistry book in the world.
Me, written up in chemistry books?
You gotta be kidding!
- What's the matter with that?
- I flunked chemistry last semester.
That is kinda weird, isn't it?
First things first. We'll spray you invisible.
As soon as you disappear, pick those things on the table up one at a time.
- It'll look like they're floating in the air.
- That should look pretty good.
[Dexter] You're darn right, it'll look terrific.
Let's rehearse it.
You're not gonna spray me tonight.
We want to see exactly how this thing works, don't we?
I've got a date in a half hour.
I don't want that stuff all over me.
I'd have to take another shower.
This is the last time you'll do it.
Now, hold still.
I said I didn't want to do it.
Dexter, now look what you've done!
[Loud crash]
Hold this. You better stay here.
[Cookie] Sorry I startled you, but I got my foot stuck in this bucket.
[Schuylar] Wonder how he did that?
You know, some people don't care how they look at all.
Boss, you are not going to believe this, but I saw it with my own eyes.
- Yeah, Cookie? You saw what?
- I don't how to tell you. It's crazy.
- Tell me what it is.
- You're gonna laugh at me.
So I'll laugh at you!
Will you tell me what it is?
Well, this...
Excuse me.
This kid's got this spray, like they used to use for bugs...
- Cookie, you're aggravating me!
- You spray people with...
Excuse me. I'm sorry, Al.
- It makes people...
- It makes them what?
- You're not going to believe this.
- Try me.
Invisible.
I believe you.
You see, I knew!
I knew like I know my own name.
- You believe me?
- You bet your sweet life, I do!
I knew there was something crazy going on around here.
Listen, birdbrain, this is what I want you to do.
[Forsythe] You know what I mean?
Good morning, Mr. Forsythe.
It's so nice to see you again.
Nice to see you.
I saw you on the golf match on TV.
Very funny.
- Funny, indeed.
- I don't know what happened.
Golf isn't important. It's science.
Hope you have something interesting for me.
You should have seen our display last night.
A new version of a helio-spectrogram.
Quite remarkable.
The Medfield Press predicted that
State'll take first place with that one.
[Forsythe] The Medfield Press isn't going to pick the winner of this contest.
Medfield's display today,
Rutland tomorrow.
Then we'll let me announce the winner Friday night, won't we?
- Yes, sir.
- Better believe it.
You sure you got everything worked out?
You're not worried?
Don't worry about me. I rise to the occasion when I perform in front of people.
As soon as you finish your act, give Debbie the signal.
She'll pour the water on you.
This thing'll be terrific.
Right this way, Mr. Forsythe.
Good morning.
Distinguished deans, honorable scholars, please come this way.
This would be a good place to watch.
This is Dexter Riley and his assistant.
Nice to know you, young people.
What've you got to show us?
We've come up with something very extraordinary on invisibility.
- You're not kidding us, are you?
- I don't think so.
Why don't you just sit down?
Let me explain the procedure to you, so that no one will be alarmed.
I'm going to spray this substance on Mr. Schuylar and he will disappear.
He will then go to the table and raise those objects. He will talk as he does this, so that you will know that it's his invisible body raising the objects.
All right?
Now, watch closely.
You don't see me, but...
I am now walking toward the table.
Now you will see a vase.
It is floating in the air.
But it is not floating in the air.
Although you cannot see me,
- I am holding the vase.
- Schuylar!
I am now walking back to the table.
This ball.
It seems to be bouncing by itself.
However it is not.
It is I who am bouncing the ball.
We've had enough of this.
Come along!
[Forsythe] You call this science.
It's a disgrace to the academic world.
That's what it is.
Don't apologize, Dean!
It may have been a simple error in the formula.
[Schuylar] I guess they've seen enough.
I'm over here.
You can hit me with the water now.
I don't want to stay invisible too long.
Pretty good, huh? But listen, next time try some lukewarm water.
Okay?
This isn't our formula.
This is just colored water.
- What do you mean?
- You didn't disappear.
I don't understand it, but somebody must've snuck in here and changed it.
Nobody knew about it, but the three of us.
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Charlie
You mean I never was invisible?
You didn't tell anybody, did you?
You didn't tell anybody, did you?
- Tell them what?
- Charlie.
- That other janitor, what's his name?
- There's no other janitor.
There was on Tuesday night.
There's no janitor who works here on Tuesday nights.
Part of Dean Higgins' economy plan.
- And you know the dean.
- Yeah, I do.
Thanks a lot!
It was that fake janitor that made the switch, whoever he was.
I've seen that face somewhere before.
- What face?
- Arno's chauffeur.
Arno with that stuff could be murder.
- I wonder what he's gonna do with it.
- And how are we going to find that out?
Maybe we should let him tell us.
Testing, one, two, three, four.
[Dexter] Loud and clear. Good luck.
Aren't those beautiful!
- They're for Mr. Arno. Is he in?
- They're gorgeous!
I'll take them in.
No, I'm sorry, but there's a message involved.
We have to deliver them in person.
There's a message for Mr. Arno.
I see. Okay, just a minute.
Mr. Arno, there are some delivery boys out here with some flowers for you.
Flowers for me?
Who'd be sending me flowers?
[Secretary] I don't know, sir.
Tell them to leave 'em.
Sir, there's a message involved.
They say they have to deliver them in person.
All right, send them in.
Who'd be sending me flowers?
Mr. Arno, sir, these flowers are for you.
Ready?
[Humming]
(music) Happy birthday to you
(music) Happy birthday to you
(music) Happy birthday, Mr. Arno
Signed E.J. Higgins,
Dean of Medfield College.
But it isn't even my birthday.
What's this all about?
Why's he sending me flowers?
I don't know, maybe he just likes you.
- What?
- We can't take them back.
It really does liven up your office.
Cookie, take care of them, will you?
- They're plastic, too.
- You don't have to water them.
Just leave 'em alone and they'll last forever.
That's good to know.
Thank you very much, boys.
I'll be sure to thank the dean when I see him. Goodbye.
That takes care of the first part. We gotta set up a watch on this radio day and night till we find out what's going on.
[Arno] Get a load of Dean Higgins sending me flowers.
He must really be in a panic.
He must think I'm going to foreclose on him. You know something, he's right!
[Guard] All right, let's give us a little room, would you please.
What do you know, a bank taking in money. That's pretty good.
In this area, Friday's payday.
The bank cashes a lot of paychecks.
People coming in from all over.
So, if you ever need any dough on a
Friday, you know where to come.
That's pretty good.
- So long, Mr. Arno.
- I'll be seeing you.
[Cookie] 20 more points,
I got you in a blitz.
I wish you'd concentrate.
I feel like I'm taking advantage of you.
You threw this eighter?
- Again? Man, you are killing me.
- I don't know why you threw me the eight.
[Cookie] You know I need the eight.
Why'd you throw it?
- I needed the eight.
- [Alfred] I did not know.
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have thrown it to you.
Okay, boys, put the cards away.
We got business.
- Big business.
- [Cookie] What's up, chief?
Alfred, first of all, I want you to go out and get a car.
Something nondescript that people won't notice.
Use a phony name, so it can't be traced back to us.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
- But his ice cream will melt.
- Will you shut up and listen?
Cookie, this will be the first one of many.
If there was a chance of getting caught,
I wouldn't try it, but there's no way.
Invisible men walk into the bank.
Spray the money invisible.
Invisible men walk out.
- The crime of the century.
- [Cookie] What are you talking about?
Cookie, at exactly 1:00 today, you and I are hitting the Medfield Bank.
Vertical line, add on, using the principle of repetition... we see what is commonly referred to as the Roman Keyhole effect.
But this in fact can be traced back to the early Phoenicians.
Early Phoenician art can be traced back to the Franco-Cantabian-Paleolithic age, when the first implements fashioned by the hand and mind of man appeared.
A fascinating question arises as to whether western naturalistic art ever made contact with the Caspian and Neolithic pre-Egyptian world.
In order to study the Phoenician art form, we must first investigate the lifestyle of the period.
And the accomplishments of these people.
Pssst!
[Professor] It is interesting to note...
- Pssst!
- [Professor]... that the color purple was first found by the early Phoenicians in a Mediterranean shellfish...
Excuse me, Professor.
...by the name of Murex.
- Excuse me.
- That is found in the Mediterranean Sea.
An extract by the name of Murex.
Murex, which is spelled...
M...
M...
So, that's what they're planning.
If we can get that formula back, we can still win that award.
They don't announce the winner till tonight.
You go to the police and tell them what you heard.
The rest of us will go down to the bank.
Let's go!
Now, you're sure about this?
You could be in an awful lot of trouble if you're wrong.
Yes, sir, I understand that.
I'll guarantee it.
Burns, I think you better go around and warn all the tellers.
But Mr. Sampson...
I'm not saying shoot to kill.
Just to keep an eye on him, that's all.
Excuse me, sir, keeping an eye on him won't do any good.
Why not?
You won't be able to see them.
What?
You see, they'll be invisible.
And they'll make the money invisible too, so... you really won't see anything.
You'll just find the money gone.
That's all.
How do you propose to stop all this?
In order to make the money visible, all we have to do is wet them down.
Wet them down?
Wet them down, I see.
I suppose you're suggesting we drive a fire truck right in here to the bank.
Something like that?
I didn't mean that exactly.
This is the biggest bunch of nonsense
I've ever heard in my life.
Burns, you may return to your duties.
Good day, Mr. Riley.
Mr. Sampson...
- What happened?
- What'd he say?
- He wouldn't believe us.
- Nobody believes us.
Hey, guys! How'd it go?
[Dexter] Nothing.
What did the police say?
- They said I was nuts.
- It's enough to drive you crazy.
We could solve the school's problems and save the bank, if we could just get somebody to listen to us!
Wait a second! Water!
Don't you see? Go to the hardware store and get a fire hose and a wrench.
- Hurry up. We haven't got much time left.
- Let's go!
- [Dick] Here he comes.
- [Dexter] Get down!
[Cookie] How 'bout this?
A spot right in front of the joint!
[Arno] Just don't hit the car in back of you, stupid!
[Footsteps]
Hurry, those guys are in there already.
A few more of these and we can break for lunch.
It's about time. My stomach's been growling for the last hour.
Why don't we go to Eddy's?
He's got great chili.
[Yelping]
We don't have to have chili.
We could have hot dogs and beans.
What's the matter with you?
[Arno] Cookie, spray all the loot, then put that thing under your coat.
Gotcha, boss.
- [Cookie] This stuff really works!
- [Arno] Okay, let's get out of here.
- Come on, Schuylar, step on it!
- I am!
Will you hurry?
They'll be gone in a second!
It's stuck!
I bet nobody's turned it in years.
Give it all you got!
[Cookie] This money's heavier than I thought.
[Arno] Will you keep quiet?
Come on, they're getting away!
Got it!
Those are the wrong guys!
Turn it off!
They're heading for the West End.
You and Dick, get down to Taylor Street.
See if you can't cut 'em off at Osbourne.
Burns, what's happened?
I don't know. I was just standing here and the lights went out.
That kid was right.
Why didn't you listen to him?
Operator, get me the police.
[Cookie] Nice day, officer.
[Cookie] It's them kids!
- What do we do, boss? We're trapped.
- [Arno] I'll show you!
- [Gunshots]
- [Screaming]
Everybody stay down.
- [Air hissing from tire]
- [Schuylar] Oh, no.
Okay, kids, clear out or we're coming out to get you!
Dexter, maybe we'd better be on our way.
Schuylar, stay behind your car.
[Sirens wailing]
[Cookie] Now we got cops. I don't like it.
[Schuylar] The police!
Come on, Sergeant.
[Dexter] We got 'em trapped.
Watch out!
What's going on here?
Let's get these cars out of here.
- I got to get to a bank robbery.
- We got the robbers trapped in that car.
- You what?
- You can't see them, that's all.
- You what?
- You can't see them, that's all.
Don't you give me any more of that invisible nonsense.
I had enough down at the station!
[Gunshot]
You know something, boy,
I'm beginning to believe you.
- Shall we shoot, Sarge?
- What at?
- [Arno] Let's get out of here.
- [Cookie] You're the boss.
[Sergeant] They're going to ram us.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here!
My insurance!
Murph, they hit our unit!
Come on, let's get that thing!
- [Schuylar] Dexter, a car!
- [Dexter] Hold on!
[Cookie] We're in trouble.
The cops are getting closer.
[Arno] You're telling me.
I got it! Spray the car invisible.
[Cookie] Boss, you're a genius.
[Sirens wailing]
[Arno] Will you hurry up?
We haven't got all day.
[Cookie] There's no cop on earth could touch us now.
Go to the right of that truck, Murph.
Slow down, it's an intersection.
Don't worry, Sarge, it's clear as a bell.
[Cookie] It's the cop's car!
How could he hit us?
[Arno] Because he didn't see us.
[Cookie] Come on, let's get out of here.
[Tires screeching]
- What'd you hit?
- I don't really know.
I bet they sprayed the car invisible.
- You know something, I think he's right.
- We hit something.
See you, Sarge.
Wait a minute.
Crazy kids.
Look out, Murphy!
Attention, all cars.
Bank robbers headed south on Osbourne St. Near 10th.
- In an invisible car.
- [Dispatch] An invisible what, Sarge?
You heard me, I said invisible car.
There's a bunch of kids in a dune buggy tailing them.
When you see 'em, close in. Out.
That's the problem with the department.
No imagination.
What's so strange about an invisible car?
Nothing.
We can't be too far behind him.
Keep your eyes open for anything.
There he is!
[Arno] Stop, you're gonna hit those guys.
[Cookie] I can't.
The kids are right behind me.
- There he is!
- Look out!
[Arno] Watch it, watch it.
Watch it!
- [Debbie] We're gonna get wet.
- [Dexter] Hold on.
- What'd you go up on the sidewalk for?
- Do you want to drive?
- There's no top.
- Be careful.
All right!
Sergeant Cassidy, come in please.
This is Sgt. Cassidy.
The invisible vehicle eluded us. He's evidently following Fuller St. Out of town.
Have your men follow three abreast,
I'll have the highway patrol set up a roadblock near the park. Out.
- Roger.
- He won't get away from us this time.
Not this time.
[Arno] They think they got us! Pull over to the side of the road. Let the kids go by.
[Dexter] Those guys aren't doing anything.
We must've passed right by 'em.
[Arno] Now, Cookie, take us home.
We'll hit the showers and set up our alibi.
[Cookie] Okay, boss, but I hope you know what you're doing.
What happened to the invisible car?
Probably let you slip by them, then went back the other way.
But don't worry, we'll get him. In fact, he's practically in our hands right now.
- [Cookie] We lost 'em.
- [Arno] Sure.
[Arno] Down the bridle path.
[Horn beeping]
- [Horses whinnying]
- [Horn beeping]
[Cookie] Hey, get them nags out of the way here!
[Horn continues beeping]
He broke through the bridle trail and headed down Peppertree Lane.
He's probably heading south.
I'll alert the Riverton police department.
In the meantime, your units can head on down there.
- Right.
- Officer, can I speak to the sergeant?
- I'm sorry, it's for official use only.
- I gotta speak to him. He's all wrong.
Yeah, I'm sure of that.
All right, fellas, move out for Riverton.
- Where to now?
- [Dexter] To see Sgt. Cassidy.
- Why?
- Because I think he's wrong.
[Sirens wailing]
I wonder what Cassidy'll say this time.
Whoever did this is just like any other crook. He's got the money.
Now all he wants to do is get as far away from this town as possible.
If you ask me, he's on his way to Riverton right now.
Arno's different. He'll want to come back, become visible and establish an alibi.
Son, that's just a guess.
We've got this whole thing figured out.
It's about time you got here.
I'm sorry, Sarge. They had me out looking for an invisible car.
I think the department's going nuts.
You do?
Come on, let's get to Riverton.
We might as well go on home.
We've done all we can here.
- Wait a second, we have to get my car.
- I forgot about that thing.
What do you mean, "that thing"?
[Arno] Look out for the police car!
That's him.
By golly, the kid was right, Murph.
Attention, all units.
Invisible car now going north on Osbourne.
How could you expect us to change the tire when you haven't got a spare?
You could've patched it or something.
You guys had plenty of time.
- You can't patch that thing. Look at it.
- [Sirens wailing]
Wait a minute. You guys hear those sirens? They must've found Arno.
It sounds like he's headed for Highland Park.
- That's where Arno lives.
- Chester Ave. Is the only way in there.
If we block it off, we've got him caged in, right? Let's go!
How am I gonna get there?
I got a flat tire.
Ride your rim.
- Come on, Schuylar, bring it over here.
- I'm coming.
- Schuylar, hurry up!
- I can't. I think I'm out of gas.
Come on, let's shove him in.
- Come on!
- [Dexter] Push!
[Arno] Is this as fast as this thing'll go?
[Cookie] I got it floored, boss.
I don't know what more you want me to do.
- [Arno] Go through there.
- [Cookie] Gotcha.
We're out of control, boss.
Let's go!
Oh, my God!
What's going on?
- What happened?
- You idiot!
- There they are!
- A pool.
- There's the formula.
- It's over there.
- Boss, I can't swim.
- Good!
Don't just stand around.
Let's get him out of there!
[Sergeant] Pull them out.
Get 'em over to the police car.
- [Arno] You stupid...
- Knock it off. Get 'em over there.
- Come on.
- Got it!
There still might be time.
Let's go. Hurry!
Look at him. The winner won't be announced for five minutes and there he is accepting congratulations.
The man is disgusting.
That improvement in the helio-spectrogram was really something.
- I'm afraid he deserves to win.
- He does not!
If Druffle hadn't been bitten by those bumble bees, we'd have had this thing locked up.
He's winning by forfeit.
He's always pulling something like this.
The man's behavior is practically criminal.
Eugene, how nice to see you.
Hello, Collingsgood. Congratulations.
You can't congratulate me now.
There are four minutes left.
We don't even know who won yet.
There's Mr. Forsythe on the platform.
Will you excuse me?
I want to get close, so I don't have to fight through the crowd
- when the announcement is made.
- Certainly.
He doesn't know who the winner is going to be, but he wants to be close, so he doesn't have to fight his way through the crowd.
[Tires screeching]
I hope we're not too late.
[Dexter] Forsythe, wait a second!
Have you announced the winner yet?
- No.
- We've still got time then.
We got it!
The real formula got stolen and we just got it back.
If you'll let us demonstrate, it'll just take a second.
It sounds unbelievable, but go ahead.
Thanks. Okay, Schuylar, get over there.
Not with the invisibility again!
They're not going to get away with it this time.
Okay, I'm ready.
If you just watch closely, it only takes two squirts.
Stop that!
Sorry, Dean, I didn't mean to get it on...
- You didn't disappear.
- He's still there.
Of course, I didn't disappear.
Can you get it through your thick heads once and for all nobody is going to disappear?!
I don't know why they insist on ridiculing me.
First that Schuylar walks around...
- Something's happened.
- Smells like chlorine.
- It does.
- Maybe some pool water got into it.
Maybe it's just diluted.
There is no such thing as invisibility.
There it goes!
[Higgins] I think I'll go home. You should too, you're getting that blank look again.
Congratulations once more.
You ought to start working out.
Your grip isn't what it used to be.
Goodbye, folks. People certainly get carried away at these parties.
[Screaming]
[Higgins] Thanks for the invitation,
Mr. Forsythe.
What's the matter with everyone?
Are they going crazy?
[Screaming]
[Higgins] My dear fella, you ought to get other work.
You're making everybody nervous.
I've never seen people act so strange.
I wonder what was in that champagne.
I'll have to...
[screaming]
What's he doing lying on the floor?
What a dream! Wait a minute, I'm here?
It wasn't a dream?
It certainly wasn't.
Dean Eugene Higgins...
I take great pride in presenting this check to Medfield College.
$50,000. The Forsythe Science Award, for your massive contribution to the advancement of science.
That was close!
That was close!
We just won the award by the skin of our teeth.
[Dexter] We sure did. At least Higgins can pay off that $50,000 mortgage now.
- The school's good for another year.
- [Debbie] But that's the problem.
He was able to come up with $50,000 this year because you invented invisibility.
But next year he's got to come up with $50,000 again.
Plus, I discovered invisibility by accident.
How many times is something like that gonna happen?
[Schuylar] Don't start borrowing trouble.
This year's all taken care of, right?
As far as next year is concerned, don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.
[Man]
Petey.
[Man #2]
Where'd he go?
[Man]
He must have went that-a-way.
- [Man] Oh, Petey...
- [Owl Hooting]
I'll wring his neck!
[Man #2]
Petey!
- Petey.
- [Hooting Continues]
- [Whispering] Elliott, put me down.
- [Men Chattering, Indistinct]
- [Man] Look around.
- [Woman] Spread out!
They're getting closer.
We'd better hide.
- [Knocking]
- Stop swingin' your tail.
You almost knocked me down.
Here they come.

Passamaquoddy.
Sounds like a nice place.
[Mumbling Gibberish]
Now, Elliott, we want the people of Passamaquoddy to like us.
- Don't we?
- [Gibberish]
I mean, you're kind of big, and we don't want to scare anyone.
- Do we?
- [Growling, Clicking Tongue]
So you better not show yourself, understand?
[Gasps, Sighs]
I know how ya feel, but you'll have to make yourself invisible.
# [Humming]
Nope.
- [Panting]
- Uh-uh.
- Nope. [Giggling]
- [Gibberish]
- Nope.
- [Moaning]
- [Panting]
- I'm sorry, but the whole thing has to go.
Behave yourself, Elliott.
[Elliott Muttering]
[Muttering Continues]
[Meowing]
[Sighs]
Eggs! Fresh eggs!
Get 'em by the dozen!
- Remember what I said, Elliott!
- Ooh!
Come on.
- Hi!
- [Clattering]
- [Whinnying]
- [Shouting]
I told ya not to fool around.
Get on the sidewalk and stay next to me.
[Banging]
[Squishing]
Look out, Elliott!
- Oops. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.
- [All Laughing]
I'm sorry, real sorry.
I was telling my dragon not to bump his head on the sign.
All right, smarties.
Into your classroom.
March, march!
[Teacher]
March! March!
March! March!
How dare you?
I mean, how dare you lie and try to embarrass me in front of my students.
- I wasn't lying.
- Thaùs a lie on top of a lie.
Ugh! You're not one of my pupils.
What school are you playing hooky from?
- I-I don't go to school.
- Ah! I knew it.
Thaùs just what this town needs.
- [Elliott Giggling]
- [Teacher] Another ignoramus.
- No, Elliott.
- [Ripping]
[All Laughing]
You disgusting little street urchin!
You could be locked up for this.
Where's the sheriff?
Please. I didn't do anything.
Your skirt got caught on a nail.
Yes!
Your fingernail!
Gentlemen,
I propose to say...
Passamaquoddy's a beautiful community... where the sun always rises and the sun always sets.
- Thaùs very deep. Don't you think?
- Elliott!
Iùs a place of serenity and security, where the unexpected never happens.
- Ow!
- [Elliott Grumbles, Growls]
- Iùs okay, Elliott.
- [Astonished Mumbling]
It seems to say,
"Welcome!"
You-You absolute oaf.
You-You idiot!
- No, come, come.
- Look, it was that kid that pushed me.
He pulled off
Miss Taylor's petticoat.
- He walked through my cement with his big feet.
- He scared my horse, Victoria.
Leùs get out of here, Elliott.
- We-Well, where is this person?
- Th-There he goes!
- Well, detain him. Detain him.
- [Crowd Shouting]
[Chuckling]
- Elliott...
- Uh-oh.
- You spoiled everything.
- [Gibberish]
Darn you, Elliott.
I told you to behave.
[Sorrowful Gibberish]
[Sighs]
Scallops.
And some oysters.
And...
Oh, hello there, little boy.
- Hi.
- [Sniffing]
- Hi.
- [Puzzled Gibberish]
- Hey! Hey, you look terrible.
- Whoopee!
Hey, your frienÔs... turned green.
- [Gibberish]
- If I didn't know any better,
I'd say he was a dragon.
- A drag-drag...
- [Growls]
Dragon!
- Elliott, didn't I tell you that...
- [Frantic Gibberish]
- [Loud Chattering]
- [Screaming, Indistinct]
[Gibberish]
Oh! Gentlemen...
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# A green and seething fire-breathing monster is in sight #
# With eyes of red a lion's head and wings as dark as night #
# Oh, he has a jaw of gleaming teeth
He's 50 feet in height #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
# Iùs true, iùs true
He'll break us all in two #
# Oh, he's comin' in
His great big fin is right against the door #
# So board up all the windows #
# And get down on the floor #
Has anybody seen my dad?
Nora, please, my child, come in.
- Get off that street.
- Whaùs the matter?
- Worst thing I ever saw in my life out on the street.
- What was it?
- I don't want to tell you for fear iùll scare you to death!
- Scare me.
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# His tail lashing, he'll be smashing every shop in town #
# With scaly feet he'll crack the street and tear the steeple down #
# Iùs not some loony dream
I heard a scream from Sheriff Brown #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
- # Iùs true, iùs true #
- # Old Lampie's in a stew #
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear there was a dragon #
# You're off your hinges
All those binges put you in a haze #
# You crazy fools
Iùs all your doggone fault he's in a daze #
# Let go of me, let go of me and mend your wicked ways #
- [Braying]
- Aah!
# What makes you think there ever was, there never was #
# There never, never, ever was a dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon dragon, dragon, dragon #
# Dragon, dragon, dragon dragon, dragon, dragon #
[Screaming]
[Cheering]
# There never, never, never never, never, never, never #
# Never, never, never, never never, never, never, never #
# Never, never, never was a dragon #
[Grumbling,
Indistinct]
- Now, why don't you just calm down?
- I seen his face.
If you wanna call it a face.
It was this close to me.
Why don't you lie down, Dad? Come on.
You know what else?
It started to smile at me.
- Well, did you smile back?
- I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.
And you know...
And you know what else?
There was this boy with it.
And he wasn't afraid.
- This boy...
- Lie down.
[Clicking, Mumbling]
[Gibberish]

# [Humming]
We're in a lot of trouble, and iùs all your fault.
[Sighing]
[Inhaling]
[Exhaling]
[Inhaling, Exhaling]
I don't wanna play.
You did everything wrong is Passamaquoddy.
Now everybody hates us.
I don't know whether you're good for me... or bad.
[Sniffles]
I'm sorry, Elliott.
I didn't really mean that.
Iùs just
I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.
[Sniffles]
[Groans]
Hello in there!
[Whispering]
Get back!
[Grumbling, Grunting]
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just playing tic-tac-toe.
[Chuckling] Well, this isn't exactly the best place for tic-tac-toe.
The tide's coming in.
High water reaches this cave sometimes.
You better head for home.
You're not from
Passamaquoddy, are you?
Nope.
Just sort of... travelling.
Where are your parents?
Where are you staying?
- Whaùs your name?
- Pete.
I'm Nora, and I have to get back on watch, up in the lighthouse.
There's chowder on the stove, if you'd like some.
Wh-Whaùs the matter?
Iùs a hand, not a shark.
You can finish that chowder... if you'd like.
[Exhales, Sniffles]
Oh, I forgot something.
Be right back.
I forgive you, Elliott.
- [Giggles]
- [Sighs, Chuckles]
Stay here till I see what iùs like up in the lighthouse.
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
The Gogans own me,
I guess.
They said it was against the law for me to ever leave them.
Where did you get that bruise?
Mr Gogan. I was milking the cow, and I missed the bucket.
- Had he done that before?
- All the time.
The first time I ran away, the orphan home sent me back.
This time,
I'll just keep running.
Well, you'll be safe here.
Nora, no one's ever been this nice to me. I'll always remember it.
Pete, why don't you sleep here tonight?
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow.
Okay?
Wonderful.
I've got work to do. Come on.
Are you anybody's mother?
I'm not even anybody's wife.
But you're gonna get married now, aren't you?
[Scoffs] I'm already married to this lighthouse.
- Who's that?
- Paul.
- Is he part of your family?
- He almost was.
- How can someone almost be part of a family?
- We were going to be married.
How come you weren't?
Well, as far as we know, his ship was headed for a storm.
They were never heard from again.
That was a year ago.
He'll come back.
I tell myself the same thing every day, standing up there watching for ships on the horizon.
[Sighs] Time I should be thinking of other things, so they tell me.
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.
He has a way of knowing things.
Who's Elliott?
- My dragon.
- Dragon?
[Gasps]
So you're the boy with the dragon.
- Yup.
- Where is he?
- Down in the cave.
- Thaùs interesting.
I've never known anyone with a dragon.
What does he look like?
Just a plain, ordinary dragon.
How plain?
How ordinary?
# He has the head of a camel #
# The neck of a crocodile #
It sounds rather strange.
# He's both a fish and a mammal #
# And I hope he'll never change #
# 'Cause iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# I'm glad I found him
I love him #
# I won't let him get away #
# 'Cause iùs not easy #
# You say the head of a camel #
- # The neck of a crocodile #
- And the ears of a cow!
# Iùs clear that friends can be different #
# Yes, I understand you now #
[Together] # Iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# Now that you have him
Hold him #
# Treasure him from day to day #
# Iùs so easy #
# Life is lollipops and raindrops #
# With the one you love #
# Someone you can always be with #
# Argue and agree with #
# Climb the highest tree with #
[Together]
# Iùs not easy #
# To share somebody's dream #
# It gets easy when you work as a team #
# You've got to tend it
Fan it #
# Thaùs what
I plan to do #
# Oh, I had one friend by my side #
# Now I have two #
# Him and you #
# Him and me #
[Together]
# And iùs so easy #
# [Humming]
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, son.
- Nice to see you again.
- Ah. Thank you.
Aah!
- Iùs you!
- Whaùs the matter?
Iùs you.
The boy with the dragon.
Yes, sir.
[Screaming]
Dad! Dad, what is it?
- The boy with the dragon.
- I know, I know. Now, just take it easy.
You saw it.
You saw it?
I didn't actually see it, but I know what it looks like.
- But wha...
- We'll talk about it later.
O-One thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?
- No, Ellioùs down in the cave.
- Oh, Ellio...
Elliott? Lt... It even has a name.
There's nothing to get upset about.
You're right. Right, there's nothing to get upset about.
Nothing. No, why should I get upset?
I should be happy.
L... I should be happy! I'll go down to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.
I'll say, "Boys, here it is."
And then hear the apologies. [Laughs]
Ellioùll be happy to do it for you, sir.
Good boy. Good lad.
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.
Oh. Elliott...
He won't... won't start to scratch or... or fight, or set anything on fire, will he?
- Well, he's sort of...
- Sort of what?
- Unpredictable.
- Now, don't do anything with Elliott.
Wh-Why don't you leave him where he is?
- Iùs too dangerous to take him into town.
- Iùs dangerous.
Now, I don't want either one of you to say a word about Elliott...
- to anyone, do you understand,
- No. No. Yes!
Until we've talked this over.
Now, leùs all have breakfast. The lamp has to be polished, the lens cleaned, and I want to take Pete to buy new clothes.
Yes, well, clean Elliott and eat the lamp.
I mean, we'll... clea-clean the lamp.
[Muttering] Elliott!
The name's Elliott. Did you hear that?
Doc Terminus is comin'!
Are they still after us?
We lost 'em.
Good.
- Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
- What?
Pass-a-ma-quoddy ahead, ahoy!
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
All hands on deck!
Here comes the Doc!
[Dog Barking]
- [Screams] Slow down!
- My fence!
Wet! Wet!
Iùs still wet!
[Screaming]
Throw out the anchor!
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.
[Screams]
[Townspeople Screaming]
When did I start losing control of my town?
[Both Screaming]
- You dummy!
- You told me to drop the anchor.
I dropped the anchor.
[Groaning]
- Watch Bones.
- Get him off of me! Get him off!
I think they remember us.
Uh-oh. I think
I remember them.
- Just act normal.
- I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.
Quick, whaùs the name of this town again?
Passamaquoddy.
- "Quassama" what?
- Passamaquoddy!
Got it. How wonderful to see your smiling faces again.
All of you.
I-I've never known such warmth, such welcome, such loving hospitality.
Get out, ya quack!
And don't bring those phoney remedies here again.
Go on back where you belong: Jail.
- [Booing]
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I sense enthusiasm,
I sense loving response, and thaùs why I feel that this is my home... away from home.

Pete, if you bring up the oil can, we'll be ready for the night.
Sure. Before that, I'd like to show Elliott my new suit.
No! No, no.
You can't bring Elliott up here.
Government regulation 302 states that... no dragons shall be allowed... on the premises of the United States' lighthouses.
Now, go on down and get the oil so I can mark it up in the log that you did that.
Okay. Nora, first can
I bring Paul's picture down to Elliott?
Then he can start looking for Paul.
All right.
[Door Opens,
Closes]
- Thanks, Dad.
- For what?
- For making believe about the dragon and going along with it.
- Making...
It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.
I'm not making believe.
I actually saw it.
And I haven't been the same since!
Go to the cave; you'd see it too, and your eyes would...
- [Popping] pop right out!
- [Scoffs]
I was there.
I saw nothing!
Dad, be realistic.
Oh, you wanna be realistic.
Leùs talk about how realistic you are.
Here you are, waiting for someone to come back that just ain't gonna come back, Nora.
And if waitin' for over a year hasn't told ya nothin', then you're not the one to talk about being realistic, are you?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

Hi, Elliott!
How do you like my new suit?
Wow!
[Panting]
[Gibberish]
And new shoes too.
Look at the way they shine!
[Laughing]
Nora's so nice to me,
I want us to do something for her.
I want you to concentrate on finding Paul for Nora.
This is what he looks like.
[Gibberish]
Remember his face.
Try real hard.
Hmm.
[Gibberish]
Better go now.
- [Kissing]
- Aww.
- See ya tomorrow.
- [Whistling]
[Giggling]
Twelve times a day till iùs empty, then come back.
One dollar, please.
Thank you.
I'm getting tired.
Sick and tired... of having to explain why we have a sail instead of horses.
Would you rather tell them how I gave the horses away in Matawanakey... to settle a malpractice suit, hmm?
- No.
- Well, don't worry.
When we leave here, we'll have horses again and plenty more.
- More what?
- More everything.
- Whoo!
- More anything! I don't know.
Do you mind if I sound optimistic?
This is the worst town on our route.
I hate Pass... Pass...
- Pastafazooli, or whatever the name is.
- Quoddy.
Yeah! I don't wanna cure anybody here.
- They all deserve to have whatever they have.
- I'll drink to that.
I've had nothing, nothing but bad luck in this burg.
Hey! Ooh...
- I'm sorry, Doc.
- You see what I mean, hmm?
Doc, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, Hoagy.
- I di... Can I buy everybody a round?
- Yeah.
Huh? Well... Hey, 'cause,
Doc, I gotta talk to you. Okay?
- Sit down.
- May I? Thank you.
Hey, you're a ma...
You're a man of science, ain't you?
A man of science, yes.
Yes, I am.
With degrees from the Royal Medical College, London.
- Huh?
- The Gleinen Einen Peitzen in Vienna.
- Oh!
- And the Moulin Rouge in Paris.
Why do you think they call me Doc?
Because they sail their boats into me, hmm?
Eh?
[Chuckling]
Oh. You know anything about dragons?
Of course I do. I see them in all the big cities going down the streets, with that funny little walk, wearing bright colours, fluttering around...
No, no, no. I'm talkin' about a real dragon.
Real dragon. With fire... fire coming out of his mouth.
And he's got real wings.
Uh, you need a veterinarian. Hmm?
- Why do you ask?
- I saw one.
Is it sitting at the next table?
Hmm? [Chuckling]
I tell ya, I saw a real dragon yesterday afternoon.
He's owned... owned by a young boy... by the name of Pete.
You are trying to tell me that there is a dragon here...
- In Passamacracka? Yeah.
- "Quoddy."
- Yes.
- I told you this was a rotten town.
Well, in my educated opinion, sir,
- I think you've been up in your lighthouse too long.
- Huh?
Wait. Wait, listen. What if what
I just told you was true?
In my scientific opinion, the existence of a dragon... would have an impact of gigantic proportions.
Mythology and legend would become history and science.
- One could really make a quick buck with it.
- Well, I can prove it.
I can prove it!
H-His name is Elliott.
[Stammering] H-He's downstairs.
You could go and see him right now.
Unfortunately,
I cannot make it right now.
I have an appointment with a young lady who's interested in a nursing career.
- Oh. Oh.
- I wanna see it.
- You wanna see it?
Well, see it you shall!
- Okay.
But first...
First, leùs have a quick one... because of the rocks we have to climb.
And the dragon...
The dragon is scary.
Okay, we'll have one for the rocks.
And one for the scary.
- Quoddy.
- Hmm?
Shh!
Nora. Shh!
We don't...
We don't...
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
- Huh?
- Shh.
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
I tell you that he's in there.
[Deep Sighing]
[Lips Smacking]
- Are you convinced?
- Absolutely.
- Well, leùs get outta here.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a mi...
I-I want to pet him.
Huh? You wa...
You want to pet him?
Are you crazy?
I know you ain't drunk.
No matter what you see in here, don't get scared.
[Footsteps]
Hey, I might as well tell you straight off, you're gonna see a hideous monster.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
And iùs big.
Fifty feet of terror!
Claws! Claws so sharp they could tear a man to shreds.
- [Gulps]
- Eyes, evil eyes... that can see right through ya.
And a tail thaùs so big and powerful, it could destroy the hull of a frigate!
It can wipe out an entire crew... with one swish of his tail.
Face... Face so terrible, it could turn a man to stone, a hero into a coward.
A flame so hot, it could roast a turkey!
And a mouth so terrible, it could devour a man and...
[Spits] spit him 20 leagues.
Stay close.
[Sputtering]
Iùs g-g-g-got m-me.
[Screams]
[Stammering]
Look at it!
[Screams]
[Both Screaming]
[Shuddering]
Them eyes are lookin' right through us.
Look, don't ever let a dragon know you're... you're afraid of him.
- [Whimpering]
- [Mumbling]
Stop-Stop shaking, and-and smile.
Can't stop shaking, and I am smiling.
[Stammering]
Hello. Hello. Hello, Elliott.
[Gibberish]
Aah! Hey, see how smart he is?
- [Whimpering]
- He said hello to me.
Yeah! He likes me!
- Y-You do somethin' so he'll like you.
- L-Like me?
Yeah. Do somethin' to make him like you.
- Huh?
- You think?
Elliott, would you... would you like a little b-belt, huh?

[Panting]
Is it... Is it two parts fish oil and three parts seawater... and six parts potato squeezings, or is it only two parts seawater, hmm?
Ten parts seawater, hmm? That much.
[Chuckles] No wonder they love it.
S-s-s-s-s-s...
- Saw it.
- Saw what?
El-El-El...
Dra-Dra-Dra...
What is an "el-el-el dra-dra-dra," hmm?
Dr-Dr-Dragon.
[Panting]
I-I saw the dragon.
L-Lampie wasn't lying.
Iùs real. It belched flame at me.
Belched?
You saw a belching dragon?
You sure you weren't belching yourself in front of the mirror?
N-Never saw anything so horrible in my life.
Th-Thought
I was a goner.
There was no need for him to do that.
I only offered him a sociable drink.
Hoagy, I can't stand you when you're drunk.
Doc, look at me.
I'm not drunk.
What I saw tonight sobered me in a second.
I swear... I swear to you, there's a big, horrible dragon... up in that cave, I swear.
I just realized,
I can't stand you when you're sober!
Now, get out of here. Get yourself a good, stiff drink. Out!
I swear.
A vicious dragon.
Out!
Dragon.
# [Humming]
Nine and nine are eighteen.
Really?
Nine times nine are eighty-one.
Amazing!
Two thousand pounds make a ton.
Wow!
That sign says "Passamaquoddy."
- You still have to go to school.
- Do I have to like it?
Like it or hate it, you have to go.
Do you wanna be stupid when you grow up, like the Gogans?
Okay, I like it.
I like it.
- Isn't that the boy with the dragon?
- I think so. Leùs go see.
Come on.
- Are you the boy with the dragon?
- Yep.
- Is it a he or a she?
- You don't name girls Elliott.
- Where is he?
- Following me.
- Elliott the dragon is walking right there.
- I can't seem to make out his colour.
- Mostly green.
- He's not too big, is he?
- Regular dragon size.
- Wow!
- Pete? School.
- Gee!
I ain't got hardly nothin' to sell.
So? I pulled my nets in, and there weren't a fish in 'em.
I just docked. There ain't nothin' out in that ocean but water.
Iùs real strange,
I'm tellin' ya.
Iùs like every fish sorta disappeared.
Just suddenly up and disappeared.
There's the cause of it.
That kid Pete.
From the day he come to town, the fishing turned sour.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Iùs that crazy dragon talk of his.
That kiÔs been nothin' but bad luck wherever he goes.
You're a bunch of superstitious ding-dongs.
You know that fishing grounds shift from time to time.
Ellioùll make the fish come back.
There he goes, talkin' dragons again.
Hey, kid! There ain't no room in this town for a dragon, and there ain't no room in this town for jinxes like you, neither!
Well, if there's enough room for a chowderhead like you, then there's more than enough room for a dragon.
# There's room for everyone in this world #

[Ringing Continues]
You're late. You're late.
Late. Late. Late.
Late.
Why is everybody late?
We were playing with
Nora, Pete and his dragon.
- His wagon?
- No, dragon!
Dragon, wagon. Thaùs no excuse for being late. Get inside.
Good morning, Miss Taylor.
Good morning. Thank you for making my students late... and for disrupting the entire schedule.
- You have a new student.
- I have?
This is Pete.
Oh, him.
If he's a transfer,
I'll have to have his records.
Unfortunately, his old school burned down and his records were destroyed.
- Pete, give her nine times nine.
- Eighty-one.
Then I'll have to have his birth certificate.
Tragically, the flames from the school house... set fire to the city hall, and his certificate went up with it.
- Pete, give her a ton.
- Two thousand pounds.
Do you want him to spell
Passamaquoddy?
No, no, no. This is irregular, irregular, irregular.
But he needs an education, education, education.
Surely you can't disagree with that.
I would if I could, but I can't.
[Bell Ringing]
Why is the bell ringing?
There's no one out there.
I'll stop it.
- Elliott, stop it!
- [Elliott Chattering]
The bell isn't supposed to ring till recess!
- Stop that!
- I'm not doing it.
Liar. Liar, liar.
Iùs the knuckle cracker for you.
Three for lying and three... for whom the bell tolls. Come.
Put your hands out.
Palms down, knuckles up.
One. Two.
- Three! Four!
- It doesn't hurt much, Elliott.
- Whom are you talking to? Five, six!
- Elliott!
- Whom?
- My dragon.
- [Laughing]
- Your dragon, wagon.
Nothing but a network of lies!
Three more for your imagination!
Seven! Eight!
And a great big nine!
Go stand in the corner.
[Huffs]
Work, work, work, everyone.
All this nonsense about a dragon.
# [Elliott Humming]
- No, Elliott!
- You did it! You pulled the chair out from under me.
- It was Elliott.
- [Gasps] That does it.
You've had a taste of the knuckle cracker.
Now you'll have a dose of the behind breaker.
- Bend over.
- [Elliott Growling, Thumping]
[Screaming]
No, no, Elliott.
Get out!
[Elliott Grunting]
- [Crowd Chattering]
- [Elliott Growling]
No, Elliott, you're going about this the wrong way.
- Go back to the cave. Go on!
- [Elliott Grumbling]
[Man]
Jehoshaphat! Would you look at that!
- Why do I hear a bell ringing?
- School must be out.
Iùs too early, stupid.
See, I told you.
School is out.
- Wait! Whaùs happening?
- Pete's dragon wrecked the school!
I told you.
I told you!
[Man]
Whaùs happened over there? Something crashed right through the school.
Look at it, I'm telling you.
Iùs a big hole in the side of the wall.
And a dragon came in through one wall... and went out the other wall.
Now do you believe me?
[Chuckling]
- You think this kid Pete would sell it?
- Money talks.
First there's a dragon.
Now he tells me money talks.
Will miracles never cease?
Dragons, dragons, dragons.
Dragons.

Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?
At last we've seen the light.
[Chuckling]
I tell you, you've got to have a sense of humour these days.
- And you must be Pete.
- Yes, sir!
I'm Dr Terminus, and this is Hoagy, who's doing his internship with me.
I heard about the incident at school yesterday.
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- I realize you must be disturbed about it, and, uh, up to here in dragons.
You know, Pete, I have always loved dragons.
They're such wonderful creatures.
When they're not busy destroying things, of course.
I've had a dream since
I was your age that one day...
I would have my very own dragon.
I would consider my life to be fulfilled... and would be most grateful if you would sell me your dragon.
You wanna buy Elliott?
Sight unseen. As is.
We'll give him a good home. Bless him.
I couldn't sell him.
Sure you could! Thaùs what life is all about: Buying and selling.
- I'll give ya three dollars.
- [Whispering] Offer him four!
I'll offer him five.
Iùll make his head swim.
Five... dollars.
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.
- Well, what did ya do, rent him?
- Well, who owns him?
Well, nobody, I guess.
He just came to me.
He only goes to those who need him.
I need him.
Listen, Doc, I don't know what you're up to, but you better forget about this.
- He's not for sale.
- Nora, go paint your lighthouse.
Pete, my boy, you're conversant with Elliott.
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.
Deliver Elliott to me and the fiver is yours, plus a bottle of my medicine thaùs guaranteed to bring on puberty two years ahead of time, and thaùs better than a dragon, hmm?
[Chuckling]
- Doc, maybe you should talk to Elliott yourself.
- Mm-hmm.
Wh-Where is he?
Does he speak English?
Down the beach.
- Where?
- Right there, by the water.
- Right. I still don't see...
- Thaùs because he's invisible today.
[Laughing]
They know they're sitting on a gold mine.
Well, they've had their chance to make a few dollars.
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!
# We'll bind him up, grind him up
Lock him up, chop him up #
# Can't you hear that jingle-jangle sound #
- # Oh yeah #
- [Cackling]
# Iùs money, money, money by the pound #
- [Horn Blowing]
- Ahh!
[Laughing]
Uh! Ah-ah-ah!
[Laughing]
Fog! Fog!
- Where's the fog?
- There's not much fog.
We were just using the horn to chase off a few buzzards.
Few buzzards. Nora, how many times must l...
Oh, started already, huh?
Look, if you're gonna whitewash, son, let your brush go up and down, up... thaùs a boy... and down.
- Up and down. Up and down.
- Thaùs right.
- [Chuckling]
- This is fun.
If iùs so much fun, I'm gonna leave it to you and Nora to finish up... while I go in and take a nice little nap.
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Tell him, Nora.
Pete, Lampie and I have talked it over.
- We feel the time has come for you to stop running.
- Yes, iùs true.
If iùs all right with you, we'd like you to live here with us.
Oh, Nora, Lampie, do you mean this could be my real home?
- It certainly does.
- And Elliott too?
- Well, l...
- Sure, and Elliott too.
But Elliott has to live in the cave.
All right, he will.
- Oh.
- [Lampie Chuckling]
No, no, no!
Not on me! Not on me!
On the side of the building, please, huh?
- Now up... Up and down.
- And down. Up and down.

Answers to the name of Pete.
Half of the kids in this town answer to the name of Pete.
Other half don't answer.
- Let me break his bones, Pa!
- Just a minute!
This particular Pete, he's always talkin'... to his big, hokey-pokey, uh, whatchamacallit, uh...
- Dragon.
- Dragon?
Merle, this here's the place.
Come on, Willie.
It would be unethical of me to leave my patient at a time like this.
Iùs important.
About the dragon.
Put your foot on there.
Now, don't move, stay tense, or that weight will fall, that clamp will break your jaw, tear your gums apart and go through your cheek.
- Tense. Tense!

Ugh! Iùs ugly!
Well! If it ain't our own little Petey!
- [Cackling]
- The Gogans!
Well, you look so nice and clean, and those new clothes.
I guess all those good manners
I taught you done paid off.
Who's that pretty lady you're with, little Pete?
- Yeah. Introduce us.
- Yeah. Introduce us.
I'm Nora, and Pete is staying with me.
Why, boys, I believe she's tryin' to break up our happy little family.
Elliott went to look for Paul.
I wish he were here.
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.
I guess we're gonna take him back now, miss, to his own home, sweet home.
- Come on, Pete.
- You won't be taking him anywhere!
Okay, lady. We're gonna take him whether you like it or not.
- Right, boys?
- Right, Pa.
Willie, you grab onto Pete, while I hold onto her.
You grab Pete.
I wanna hold her.
- I wanna hold her!
- Well, I'm gonna hold her!
[Squabbling]
All right!
I'll settle this.
You two grab the brat.
I'll hold her.
Lf'n you think you're gonna hold her like my boys wanna hold her, you're gonna be holdin' your head, ya understand?

We done had our bath in May!
Ahh-ahh-ahh...
- [Sneezing]
- [Men] Bless you, Ma.
- [Coughing]
- Excuse me, folks.
I witnessed what happened today, and I'm completely sympathetic with you.
- Whaùs sympathetic mean?
- I'm Doc Terminus. Like to talk to you.
Oh, Doc, I got this here "poomonia."
- Sit down.
- Ahh-ahh-ahh...
[Sneezing]
- Bless you, Ma.
- Bless you, Ma.
[Groaning, Panting]
I got this terrible ache in my back!
Good. Whaùs rightfully yours is rightfully yours.
Now, you want Pete, right?
- Right!
- Right!
- Right!
I want... the dragon.
- The dragon?
- The dragon?
- [Laughing]
W-W-Wait a minute.
Now I got a stitch in my side.
You really want the dragon?
Very much. Mm-hmm.
Well, then, what are you willing to give for it?
The help you need getting Pete.
I'll need the same kind of help getting the dragon.
[Cackling]
[Laughing]
N-Now I think the pain's in my head!
- Have we got a deal?
- Sure.
We scratch your back, you scratch ours.
The boathouse, sunset, hmm?
Uh, Doc.
What you gonna do with a dragon?
Oh, maybe put him on a ranch, breed him. Hmm?
Big stud fees.
Ahoy. Ahoy. Here.
How would you like to make the fishing good again?
- How do we do that?
- Catch that dragon!
Set a trap for him, throw a net over him, drag him away.
Goodbye, Elliott.
Hello, fish. Hmm?
Sunset, the boathouse.
Spread the word, hmm?
[Fishermen Murmuring
In Agreement]
Get back!
Get back!
Dr Terminus! Here's that there harpoon you wanted!
Good! Put it right over there!
[Ma]
Now you just remember our bargain!
Okay, I want separate trip lines on the primary tarp, the secondary net and on the tertiary.
- T-Tertiary?
- Whaùs that?
Dragon medicine.
[Cackling]
- Okay, fix it.
- We've done it!
Don't signal till you're re...
- [Men Shouting]
- Get this net up off of me!
Will you get this... Will you get this net up! Up! Up!
Now, I've gotta go and get that kid.
You rehearse this and make it run like clockwork or else.
Elliott!
Oh, Elliott, you were terrific the way you saved us from the Gogans.
- [Laughing]
- What?
[Gibberish]
Do you mean it?
[Clicking Tongue]
Wow! Thaùs great.
You're the most wonderful dragon in the whole world.
[Soft Growling,
Clicking Tongue]
Wait till I tell Nora!
# [Humming]
Nora! Nora! Good news!
Elliott found Paul, and he's on his way home!
- Pete...
- I wouldn't say anything like that if I were you.
But iùs true.
Elliott said.
Please.
There's been enough talk about Paul, and Elliott too.
[Sighing]
Both of us have to be... realistic.
Paul's ship went down.
He's not coming back.
And I have to adjust my life to it.
You have to make a big adjustment too.
You have us now.
You don't have to make believe your only friend is a dragon.
But I'm not making believe.
Thaùs what I mean by "realistic."
There are no dragons.
Except for Elliott.
He's real.
Lampie, you've seen him, haven't you?
Well, l...
I thought I saw him.
Wait till Paul gets here. Then you'll know how realistic Elliott is.
Okay.
Until that time, leùs try not to talk about it.
How about filling the reserve oil can?
Sure.
Well, at least one of us is entitled to have illusions.
[Thunderclap]
[Wind Howling]
Pete! Pete, iùs Elliott!
- Whaùs the matter?
- Ellioùs in Passapaka... Pakadaka...
He's in town, and he's tearing the place apart.
- You've gotta do something.
- Oh, no!
[Laughing]
We should be in the channel.
We shoulÔve made
Passamaquoddy Light by now.
There it is!
Iùs my home port.
I didn't think I'd ever see it again.
- Iùs a welcome sight.
- Looks great to me.
I know the light keepers personally.
- He's in there! Come on!
- Elliott! Elliott!
Did I say the primary was really the tertiary?
[Men Shouting]
Never!
- Where's Elliott?
- Nowhere!
Your hokey-pokey dragon's out helping Santa Claus pull his sled!
- Boys!
- Let me go!
Now you're never gonna get away again!
We're gonna put chains on you when you're workin'!
- And when you're not workin'.
- And when you're sleepin'!
Okay, okay. Tear him to pieces in your own time.
Right now he is the bait for the trap.
Take him in there where that thing can see him when he comes through the door.
He'll head straight for Pete.
We spring the trap.
After the tertiary net drops on him,
I'll give you the signal, and you fire the harpoon right into the middle.
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Got it?
Got it!
But what I don't got is, h-h-how you gonna get that monster, that hideous beast, that nightmare sent by the devil, to come here?
Easy. We get someone he knows to bring him here.
Well, who'd be crazy enough to do that?
No! No!
He knows you.
He trusts you.
He scares me!
He hates me!
Hoagy.
We are all on this earth for a purpose, and the time for your purpose is now.
I know that inside this pale, frail, pathetic shell of a man... there is a Vesuvius ready to erupt.
Now, I've known you, man and beast, since, since you were nothing.
But now, Hoagy, now, you're still nothing, but you could be something!
You can be a somebody.
A legend, Hoagy. A legend in your own lifetime, not a joke!
The momenùs here, Hoagy.
Grab it. Grab it!
Today the jester.
Tomorrow the king!
- No!
- Get out!
[Whimpering]
[Elliott Snoring]
E-Elliott.
C-Can you come out here for a second? Please?
[Snoring]
[Gasping]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
Wake up.
W-W-Wake up!
[Snarling]
D-D-Don't get n-n-nervous!
I'm a friend.
[Groaning, Snorting]
Don't roast me!
[Snarling]
Boo!

H-Hon... Honest.
L-l-I-I-I got a m-mess... m-m-m-message about P-P-Pete!
- T-The G-G-Gogans...

Got P-P-P-Pete!
- [Bellowing]
- Ahh!
[Snarling, Roaring]
Aaah!
Follow me!
[Thunderclap]
Captain, the lighùs gone!
There's a reef between us and the channel.
Dad, I can't find Pete.
- Can you get it lit?
- I have to put in a dry wick.
Battle stations!
[Hoagy] I told you!
I told you, Elliott! There he is!
Look out, Elliott!
Iùs a trap!
Aaah! Get him!
He's right here!
Drop everything!
Drop everything!
[Men Shouting]
[Elliott Bellowing]
Elliott, over here!
[Hoagy] Get me out of here!
Elliott, don't step on me!
- Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
- Iùs beginnin' to look like a...
- Dragon!
- Don't say that!
I've got it!
We've done it! Out!
We've got it!
We've got it!
- Hoagy!

Please!
Please, let me out!

- Doc, get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!
- Okay. Okay!
[Growling]

- Help! Over here!
- Don't say that!
Tie him down!
Help, Elliott, help!
Man this harpoon. Take this.
[Chuckling]
Light the fuse.
No, no!
Don't shoot Elliott!
[Ma Screaming,
Shouting]
[Pa]
Get him back! Get him back!
The other.
- [Pa] Pick him up!
- [Ma] Take him outside!
[Hoagy]
Get out of the way!
- [Whimpering]
- [Screaming]
He's going!
Let me get a bead on him!
- Elliott, save me!
- [Ma] Don't let him get away again!
Get him outta here!
- Hands...
- Elliott, don't let 'em take me!
[Growling]
[Roaring]
[Stammering]
Wait! Wait!
[Ma Shouting]
- [Muttering]
- [Gogans Whimpering]
Huh? Pete!
- Thanks, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
You just listen to me!
That there boy belongs to me!
I paid fifty dollars for him, plus legals, and I got a bill of sale right here to prove it.
[Snarling]
- Boo.
- [Screaming]
[Ma] Merle, help! Get me out of here!
Don't just stand there!
Come on! Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!
[Ma]
You clucks!
[Elliott Laughing]

- [Ma] Let him keep the brat!
[Roaring]
[Ma]
Come on! Get in the wagon!
[Shouting]
[Ma]
Wait! Wait for us!
[Elliott Howling]
Daaah-ah-ah!
Aaah-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[Screaming]
Aaah! Doh!
Hoagy, get me down!
We've gotta do something!
That dragon's gonna get away!
[Snarling]
[Whimpering]
Where is he? Where is he?
Elliott! Wait!
Wait, Elliott!
I wanna make a deal with ya.
To buy up all your used and spare parts, you know, like a hangnail, or if you shed your skin, or if your hair falls out,
I'll pay you top dollar!
Whaùs the matter with you?
Don't you have any business sense?
- Don't shout!
- Elliott! Elliott!
[Screaming]
He's gonna eat us up!
[Growling]
Oh!
[Whimpering]
[Wagon Crashing]
...in the street.
Quite a storm here.
Wait a minute.
Watch those stairs.
- [Gasping]
- [Electricity Crackling]
Oh, look!
Th-Th-There really is a dragon!
Yes, and he saved us!
- Dragon!
- A dragon! A real dragon!
- Attaboy, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
[Clicking Tongue]
That ship's headed for the reef!
Go down and sound the foghorn!
[Foghorn Blowing]
Elliott, quick! Quick!
[Foghorn Blowing]
[Ship Creaking]
Nora, let me have the light so I can see what I'm doing.
[Foghorn Blowing]
Come on, Elliott.
You can do it.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- I got it!
Come on, Elliott.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- Come on, Elliott!
[Panting]
[Pete]
Hurry!
Whaùs the matter?
Everything is wet in here, thaùs whaùs the matter!
- Don't worry, Lampie. Elliott came.
- Elliott?
Thaùs all I need is a dragon in here. Ah!
Get him outta here!
[Muttering]
Start your burner, Elliott.
Light the wick.
[Gibberish]
- [Clicking Tongue]
- All right, Elliott. Go ahead. Light it.
[Pete]
Now, Elliott! Now!
All right.
Where's the fire?
- [Groaning]
- Whaùs the matter?
[Gibberish, Sputtering]
- He's all squished up in the stairs.
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- [Foghorn Blowing]
- [Elliott Blowing]
- El-Elliott?
- [Gibberish]
He's real.
He's really real.
[Muttering,
Clicking Tongue]
- Of course he is.
He's gonna light the wick.
- Can he do it?
Can he? He can throw a flame clear across to Bar Harbor... if he can get his own burner goin'!
[Gasping]
- Come on, Elliott!
- [Whining]
- Go on!
Come on, Elliott!
Come on!
[Lampie]
Blow, Elliott!
[Drawing A Deep Breath]
- Wow! [Panting]
- [Pete] Elliott, you did it!
[Gibberish,
Clicking Tongue]
Look there!
That means the harbor is dead ahead, Captain!
Hard right rudder!
Elliott, I could give you a great big kiss.
[Shuddering]
# A dragon, a dragon
You bet we saw a dragon #
# So big and brave, he came to save a village in distress #
# He kept the ship from crashing when he heard the S.O.S. #
# He faced a group of villains and he fought them with success #
# He's great
He's great #
- # A chum #
- # A pal #
- # A mate #
# A dragon, a dragon
We're proud to love a dragon #
# Before he came to fight the storm the night was dark and dim #
# Now everyone in town is safe again because of him #
# He filled the ocean full of fish
He packed it to the brim #
# We want it known that he's our very own #
Nora! Nora!
Paul!
[Elliott Muttering]
- What happened?
- We sank in a storm off Cape Patters.
I was the only survivor.
When I woke up in the hospital,
I'd lost my memory.
Then the other day, a strange thing happened.
My bed suddenly tipped over.
I don't know how, but I bumped my head and everything came back to me.
- Iùs a miracle!
- [Chattering]
Iùs Elliott.
Gather around, everyone. I'm going to have a few appropriate words to say.
Gather around. Come on.
Closer, closer.
There you are, yes.
Iùs nice to see you.
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pete, I want you to thank
Elliott the dragon... for the council here and all the townspeople.
- You do that?
- Well, he's right here.
He'd appreciate it if you'd thank him yourself.
- [Laughter]
- You mean I can talk right to him, huh?
Go right to the main source.
That was my campaign...
- No, he's over here.
- Oh! Oh, over that side.
So, uh, on behalf of...
[Laughter]
[Muttering]
Thank you.
# Iùs a brazzle dazzle day #
- # So throw off the past and everything in it #
- [Elliott Clicking Tongue]
# Thaùs the brazzle dazzle way #
# Enjoying your time from minute to minute #
Hi!
Oh, Elliott, you're the greatest.
You've made everybody happy, especially me.
I'm very proud of you.
[Muttering]
We've got a real family now and a place to live.
[Clearing Throat]
[Gibberish]
You've gotta go?
When will you be back?
[Gulping, Muttering,
Sniffling]
You... You won't be back?
[Muttering]
But why?
Did I do something wrong?
[Muttering]
[Snarling]
There's another kid in trouble?
[Muttering,
Growling]
[Soft Roar]
Well, if anyone can get him out of it, you can.
- Ohh...
- [Giggling]
[Muttering]
I won't see you again, will I?
Ever.
[Sniffling, Whimpering]
[Sniffling]
What are you sniffing for?
[Gasping, Sneezing]
[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
Now, remember, don't scare people.
[Gibberish]
Goodbye, Elliott.
Goodbye.
[Gibberish]
- It is a dragon!
- [Pete, Lampie, Nora] Iùs Elliott!
[Pete] And remember, you're supposed to be invisible!
IA'
- FIRE ONE ACROSS
THE BOW, MATES!
- ONE ACROSS THE BOW!
- ONE ACROSS THE BOW, IT IS.
IA'
IA'
- ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN,
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
I WANT YOU TWO TO PLAY NICELY,
AND DON'T FIGHT.
- IT ALL STARTED THAT
FIRST THURSDAY IN JULY.
MOM AND DAD WERE
GOING ON VACATION.
WE WERE STAYING HOME.
MOM WAS SUPER WORRIED,
BUT DAD CALMED HER DOWN.
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY.
"THE CHILDREN WON'T
REALLY BE ALONE.
"THEIR OLD FRIEND,
PIPPI LONGSTOCKING,
"HAS PROMISED TO KEEP
AN EYE ON 'EM."
- OKAY, KIDS,
HAVE FUN AT PIPPl'S.
- YOU WOULD SAY THAT, SVEN.
NOW, I'M STARTING
TO WORRY AGAIN.
- GEE, WHAT ARE YOU
WORRYING FOR?
- THAT'S WHAT I SAY.
ANNIKA.
BYE, TOM.
- GIVE US A KISS.
- SEE YA.
- SAY HELLO TO PIPPI FOR US.
- OKAY, BYE.
- I WILL.
- SO LONG.
SEE YA!
HAVE A GOOD TIME!
- WE WILL!
BYE!
SEE YA.
- SEE YA!
- IMAGINE, LIVING AT PIPPl'S
FOR A WHOLE THREE WEEKS.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
- GREAT!
HI, OLD MAN!
- HI, OLD MAN.
HOW ARE YOU?
WANT A PIECE OF SUGAR?
OKAY, THERE YOU ARE.
CHEW IT CAREFULLY.
HOW IS IT'?
GOOD?
SURE.
- PIPPI!
- PIPPI, WE'RE HERE!
PIPPI!
- PIPPl!
- PIPPl!
- PIPPl!
- WHERE ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
- PIPPl!
- I FOUND HER ON THE COUCH.
SOUND ASLEEP.
WAKE UP!
- PIPPI, WHERE
HAVE YOU GONE?
- WELL, YOU JUST
TRY TO FIND ME.
- SHE'S OUTSIDE
IN THE YARD.
PIPPI!
- WATCH OUT!
I'M COMING IN
FORA LANDING!
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T FLYA BED-.
- NOBODY CAN FLY A BED-.
- IT lSN'TA BED.
THIS IS A--
MMM... lT'SAZEPPELIN.
- AW, THAT'S NO ZEPPELIN.
- SURE, IT ISAZEPPELIN.
I SHOULD KNOW.
I BUILT IT, DIDN'T I?
IA'
EXCUSE ME, MY BEARD
NEEDS A LITTLE TRIMMING.
NOW I LOOK JUST
LIKE PIRATE FABE.
- PIRATE FABE?
WHO'S THAT?
- HE WAS MY GRANDFATHER.
CAPTAIN FABIAN LONGSTOCKING.
MOST DANGEROUS PIRATE
OF THE SEVEN SEAS.
HE ONLY ROBBED
BIG SHIPS
BECAUSE THEY CARRIED
LOTS OF TREASURE.
AND ALL THE TREASURE HE
BURIED IN A SECRET CAVE,
ON A FARAWAY ISLAND,
WHERE IT REMAINS HIDDEN
TO THIS VERY DAY.
- IMAGINE, THE TREASURE
OF A PIRATE.
- THEN THAT'S WHERE
YOU AND YOUR DAD GO
TO GET THOSE GOLDEN COINS.
- UH-HUH.
GEE, THEY DONT
MAKE BEDS LIKE THEY USED TO.
PIPPI, THE PIRATE
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GOING TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
- OH, SURE, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN GOT A BOAT.
- WHO NEEDS A BOAT?
I'LL JUST WALK
ON THE WATER.
- WALK ON WATER!
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.
- OKAY.
IA'
- WELL, NOW WE KNOW
YOU CAN'T WALK ON WATER.
- BUT THEN I
HAVEN'T PRACTICED.
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE
TO DO ANYTHING WELL.
- I SEE A BOTTLE OUT THERE
WITH A NOTE INSIDE.
- HEY, YEAH.
I THINK, YOU'RE RIGHT, ANNIKA.
DON'T WORRY.
NO SECRET MESSAGE EVER GOT AWAY
FROM PIPPI LONGSTOCKING.
- IS IT REALLY
A BOTTLE MESSAGE?
- I THINK SO.
THERE'S A PAPER
INSIDE IT, ANYHOW.
- ISN'T THIS EXCITING?
- HERE, YOU TAKE IT, TOMMY.
YOU'D BETTER READ IT,
'CAUSE I STILL DON'T KNOW
ALL THE LETTERS.
- PIPPI, FROM YOUR PAPA!
- WELL, HURRY.
READ THE WORDS.
- "PIPPI, COME HELP ME
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE."
- READ THE REST, FAST!
- WELL, IT SAYS, "I'VE BEEN
CAPTURED BY PIRATES."
- OH, PAPA,
HOW COULD YOU?
- "THEY'VE TAKEN
MY SHIPAND CREW,
"AND PUT US ASHORE
ON A DESERTED ISLAND-.
"ME, I SEEM TO BE IN
A SMALL PIRATE'S TOWN.
"BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE EXACTLY,
"'CAUSE I WAS BROUGHT
HERE BLINDFOLDED.
"REMEMBER THOSE TWO NEW
MEN I WROTE ABOUT'?
"WELL, THEY GOT TOGETHER
WITH A BAND OF PIRATES,
"ORGANIZED A MUTINY,
"THEN BECAME PIRATE
CHIEFS THEMSELVES,
"CALLED BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE."
"THEY HAVE ME LOCKED UP
IN A MUSTY OLD FORT,
"AND THEY PLAGUE ME
NIGHT AND DAY
"TO TELL THEM WHERE
THE TREASURE IS.
"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, PIPPI,
COME HELP ME BEFORE I STARVE.
"ALL THEY GIVE ME
IS BREAD AND WATER."
- BREAD AND WATER?
MY POOR PAPA.
- CHUBBY.
HEY, CHUBBY.
ARE YOU WEAKENING,
CHUBBY, EH?
- STOP CALLING ME CHUBBY.
CHUBBY.
CHUBBY, HUH?
- KEEP LAUGHING,
ROSALINDA.
SEE?
- EH?
- A MESSAGE.
NOW ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS WAIT.
- YOU JUST WAIT, CHUBBY.
YOU JUST WAIT.
- I DON'T WANNA WAIT!
I DON'T WAN NA WAIT!
I WANNA GET OUT!
- I'VE GOTTA GET UP A
RESCUE EXPEDITION, FAST.
- WE'LL GO WITH YOU, PIPPI.
- MOMMY WON'T LIKE THAT, TOMMY.
WE'D BETTER STAY HOME.
- OH, I THINKALL THREE
OF US GOING TOGETHER
ISA NEAT IDEA.
- I DON'T.
- DIDN'T I PROMISE
ON MY WORD OF HONOR
TO LOOKAFTER YOU
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE?
- WELL, YES.
- IF I LEFT YOU HOME,
I WOULDN'T BE KEEPING
MY WORD, WOULD I?
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD
HAPPEN TO THE TWO OF YOU
WHILE I WAS AWAY?
TERRIBLE THINGS, MAYBE.
- THAT'S TRUE.
- NOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
ON THIS EXPEDITION.
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ATELESCOPE...
A REAP'. --...
A SEXTANT...
AND THIS.
THIS IS GREAT.
- WHAT'S SO GREAT?
- FIRST, IT WAS PURCHASED
IN ACAPU LCO.
IT'S A MAGIC BALL.
NO FOOLING.
IT BELONGED TO
A FORTUNE TELLER.
CRYSTAL...
CRYSTAL BALL.
WHAT'S BECOME OF PAPA?
GOOD BALL...
FAMOUS BALL...
WHERE'S PAPA?
SHOW ME WHERE HE IS.
AW, THE STUPID THING
DOESN'T WORK.
WE'D BETTER TAKE THIS GUN.
" WOW!
- I KNOW MOM WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT A THING
IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE
PROTECTED WITH A GUN.
- SURE, SHE'D BE GLAD.
- IMAGINE, GOING TO
A REAL PIRATE'S TOWN.
HOW EXCITING!
- CRYSTAL BALL...
CRYSTAL BALL.
OH, IF ONLY THAT CRYSTAL BALL
WASN'T SO STUPID.
I WAS SURE IT WOULD SHOW US
WHERE MY PAPA IS.
- PORTO PILUSE.
PORTO PILUSE.
- GOODBYE, OLD MAN.
" BYE!
" BYE!
- DON'T EAT ALL
YOUR OATS AT ONCE.
SAVE SOME FOR LATER.

THERE ARE NO DANGEROUS

WE'LL HAVE TO LOOSEN UP
YOUR TONGUE A LITTLE.

WE HAVE TO RESCUE HER PAPA,
THEN GET RIGHT HOME.
HELP!

THAT WAS SILLY.

- FOR ALLI KNOW,
A SHIP MIGHT BE HEADING
THIS WAY RIG HT NOW.

TOMMY, ANNIKA,

MIGHT BE IN CHARGE.
- WELL, THEY'VE
SAILED IN OUR PORT!
- HEY, WATCH OUT, PIPPI!
SHARKS, SHARKS!
- THE OCEAN IS FILLED.
IT'S FILLED UP
WITH BIG SHARKS.
COME BACK!
- WHO'S AFRAID OF
SOME OLD SHARKS?
GETAWAY, YOU OLD SHARK.
I HAVE TO GET THROUGH.
THAT'S THE WAY.
THAT'S A GOOD SHARKIE.
- WELL, GOOD MORNING.
ONE-EYED OSKAR,
WHAT GETS YOU UP SO EARLY?
- WELL, LOOK, KALLE,
A MAN HAS TO SLEEP SOMETIME.
EVEN IF HE IS
AN ADVENTURER.
WELL, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'LL SAY
AFTERWARDS ABOUT US?
- WHAT?
- THAT YOU AND ME,
KALLE THE FOX
AND ONE-EYED OSKAR,
ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS
PIRATES ON THE SEVEN SEAS.
WE'LL LAUGH AT THOSE PIGS.
THAT BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE.
MOVE OVER, BOYS!
MAKE ROOM!
- AND ONCE WE GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT LONGSTOCKING GUY,
WE WON'T BE JUST THE MOST
DANGEROUS ON THE SEVEN SEAS,
WE'LL BE THE RICHEST!
SET SAIL, LADS!
TO PORTO PILUSE!
TO PORTO PILUSE!
WHAT WAS THAT?
- OH, THE WATER'S
ALIVE WITH SHARKS.
LOOK, YOU JUST
LEAVE BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE TO ME.
WITH MY OWN HANDS,
I'LL PUT 'EM RIGHT ON THE PLAN K,
AND THEY'RE FINISH ED.
- AND THAT LONGSTOCKING GUY
GOES RIGHT DOWN TO THE HOLD,
AND THERE HE STAYS
ON BREAD AND WATER,
TILL HE SQUEALS ABOUT WHERE
HE'S BURIED HIS TREASURE.
- QUICK, GET OUR THINGS OUT!
- WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO, PIPPI?
- WE'RE GOING TO BECOME PIRATES
AND TAKE THAT SHIP.
- HOW WILL WE BE
ABLE TO DO THAT?
- AS GRANDFATHER USED TO SAY,
WE HAVE TO BE CLEVER.
- POOR BLOD-SVENTE.
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
IN HIS SHOES.
- AND NOT IN
JOCKE'S EITHER.
COME OVER HERE.
- OSKAR!
- OSKAR!
- OSKAR!
- WHO IN THUNDER
CAN THAT BE?
- OSKAR!

WHO KNOWS ME OUT HERE?
- DON'T ASK ME.

GHOSTS, YOU THINK?

OSKAR!
COME AND GET THE
TREASURE, OSKAR!
- PIRATE TREASURE.
- DON'T WORRY, OSKAR.
WE'LL ALL GO WITH YOU.
EVERYBODY IN THE BOATS.

AND KEEP A SHARP WATCH.
- HEAVE!
HEAVE, TOO,

- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THAT TREASURE!

HEY, THAT'S SCARY.

YOU MAY HAVE RUINED
OUR WHOLE ESCAPE PLAN.
- HEY, YOU THINK
THE MONKEY CALLED?
- NAH.
I KNOW THEY'RE
NOT THAT SMART.

AN UNINHABITED ISLAND,
DRESSED LIKE A PERSON.
- EH... COME!

- WELL, THEY GOTTA
BE HERE SOMEPLACE!
- WHO SAYS SO?
MAYBE THEY'RE BLASTED SPOOKS,
IS WHAT THEY ARE.
- SPOOKS, MY FOOT.
THEY'RE HERE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
IT SUDDENLY GOT SO QUIET.
WHY DON'T THEY SHOUT
OR CALL OUT,
SO WE CAN TRACE
THEIR VOICES?
- LISTEN, SOMETHING FISHY'S
GOING ON AROUND HERE.
- OOH.
- HELLO, HELLO!
BACK TO THE BOATS!
BACK TO THE BOATS, EVERYBODY!

BEFORE THE SHARKS GET YOU.

- PIPPI, I DO FEEL SORRY
FOR THOSE PIRATES.
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED
TO GET OUT OF THERE?
- BUT THEY HAVE
BOATS, ANNIKA.
AND THEY ALL CAN ROW,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.
- HEY, THAT RHYMES!
BUT ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE
THEIR BOAT AWAY FROM THEM
LIKE THAT?
- IT ISN'T THEIR BOAT.
THEY CAPTURED IT,
AND THEN TOOK IT RIGHTAWAY
FROM SOMEONE ELSE!
- WE'LL BORROW IT TILL WE GET
HOME TO VILLA VILLEKU ILA.
THEN THE FIRST
THING I'LL DO
IS STICK AN ADVERTISEMENT
IN THE PAPER.
"FOUND, ONE PIRATE SHIP.
"MAY BE CLAIMED BY
GIVING DESCRIPTION."
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW FILTHY YOU CAN GET
ON THESE EXPEDITIONS, TOM.
- GOOD THING
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- BETTER GIVE
YOUR SHIRT TO ME.
PIPPI, GIVE ME YOUR APRON.
- HERE, ANNIKA.
IA'
- HA-HA!
- THERE YOU ARE.
- AW, NO!
THERE IS THE PIRATE FABE!
DREAD MENACE OF
THE SEVEN SEAS.
HA-HA!
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT,
"HA-HA?"
- WELL, HAVEN'T YOU HEARD,
THAT'S WHAT ALL PIRATES SAY.
HA-HA!
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE PIRATE
SHIPS THAT ARE FULL OF GRUB?
L'! I ill h'! E
I'LL STAND WATCH.
GO GET SOME GRUB, MATE.
- SO, PIRATE FABE HIMSELF
WILL BE AT THE HELM.
- YUP.
- GOOD.
I'M STARVED.

I ALWAYS SAY.

WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE
TAUGHT YOU SOME MANNERS!
- THIS MAY NOT RAISE
YOUR LEVEL MUCH,
BUT AT LEAST
IT'S A START.
- GOOD.
- POOR MARCO.
- IT WASN'T MARCO'S FAULT,
YOU BIG, OBJECTIONABLE BULLY.
IT WAS COMPLETELY THE FAULT
OF THOSE TWO DEVILS.
AND SINCE THEY'RE BEHAVING
JUST LIKE-LIKE CHILDREN,
THEY SHOULDN'T
BE OUT SO LATE,
'CAUSE THEY'LL WORRY THEIR
POOR MAMAS AND PAPAS.

WE'LL NEVER GET IN THERE.
THOUGH, THE IDEA
SOUNDS AWFUL.
IA'
- MARCO!

PIPPI.
WHEN SHE DOES,
I'M GONNA LET HER HAVE IT
RIGHT IN THE KISSER.
THAT BRAT IS GETTING
ON MY NERVES.
I'M SICK AND TIRED.
I MEAN IT!
- WELL, YOU'D BETTER TRY
OUT THE CANNONS FIRST
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
WORKING RIGHT.
- AYE-AYE, CAPTAIN.
TEST ALL CANNON.
WHO DID THAT?
- WHO FIRED?
- BATTLE STATIONS!
- OH, MY!

WE ONLY HAVE
A FEW SECONDS .
- WHERE WE GONNA GO?
- WE'LL HIDE IN THE WELL.
- THIS I KNOW MOMMY
WOULDN'T LIKE.
SHE GETS HYSTERICAL
EVEN IF WE GET OUR FEET
A TI NY, LITTLE BIT WET.
- I THINK SHE'S
A BIT SQUEAMISH.
- LET'S CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.
LOOK, PIPPI, HOW LONG
ARE WE GONNA STAY HERE?
- I THINK UNTIL TONIGHT,
WHEN THE PIRATES GO TO SLEEP.
- AND FIRE!
AND FIRE!
AND FIRE!
- "AND FIRE" MEANS
QUITE AN EXPLOSION.
GEE, IF I ONLY KNEW WHERE
THEY WERE HOLDING MY PAPA
AS THEIR PRISONER.
I THINK I'LL GO UP THERE
AND HAVE A LOOKAROUND.
- CAREFUL, PIPPI.
- ARE YOU WEAKENING
YET, CHUBBY?
I'M WEAKENING.
I THINK I'VE
LOST ALL COU RAGE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
PIPPl'S EVER COMING.
I GUESS SHE NEVER
GOT MY BOTTLE NOTES.
- BRAVO, BRAVO!
- YOU ARE THE MEANEST PAPAGAYA
I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE
TO MEET.
- KISS ME.
KISS ME.
- NO, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
MUST HANG UP THIS HANKY
TO DRY OUT.
- I KNOW WHERE
THEY'VE GOT MY PAPA.
HE'S IN THE EAST TOWER.
I SAW HIS BIG HANDKERCHIEF
HANGING OUTSIDE.
- ARE YOU POSITIVE THAT IT'S
HIS HANDKERCHIEF YOU SAW?
- SURE, I GAVE IT TO HIM MYSELF
AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT,
YOU SEE.
IA'
- WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
- I DON'T KNOW THE WORDS.
IT'S A SCANDINAVIAN
PIRATE SONG.
GRANDFATHER FABIAN
USED TO SING IT, TOO.
- PROBABLY BRAGGING ABOUT
HOW GREAT THEY ARE.
IA'
- OH, PIPPI,
I'M SO HUNGRY.
- I AM, TOO.
- WELL, WE'LL FIX THAT.
- STEP OVER HIM.
WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- IT LOOKS LIKE-LOOKS
LIKE JOCKE THE KNIFE.
- YES, IT'S JOCKE,
ALL RIGHT.
BUT HE'S KNIFELESS.
THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE
MY PAPA'S A PRISONER.
- WE CAN'T GET
UP THERE, PIPPI.
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.
- YES, I KNOW THAT.
BUT BY FABIAN, I TELL YOU
THAT I MUST GET UP THERE.
YOU TWO WAIT HERE.
- BUT WHAT'LL WE DO
IF THE PIRATES WAKE UP?
- HIDE IN THE CANNONS.
YOU'LL FIND IT
QUITE SAFE THERE.
- COME ON.
IA'
OH, PAPA.
LOOK, HE'S BEEN CRYING.
OH, PAPA.
PAPA, CANT YOU JUST FEEL

EVERY HOUR, THERE ARE
GUARDS WHO SHOW UP.
HOW DID YOU

IF YOU HADN'T
GAINED WEIGHT.

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
Many ages ago, when this ancient planet was not quite so ancient...
...long before man recorded his history...
...there was the time of Middle Earth when man shared his days...
...with elves, dwarves, wizards, goblins, dragons and hobbits.
In the lands of Middle Earth, in an area known as the Shire...
...there was a village named Hobbiton.
There, in a hole in the ground, lived a hobbit.
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole...
...nor a dry, bare, sandy hole.
It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort.
Bilbo Baggins?
- I'm looking to hire a burglar.
- Burglar?
You've come to the wrong place.
You mean you do not wish to share a grand adventure?
Dear me, no.
We hobbits are plain, quiet folk.
Adventures make one late for dinner.
Enough! I am Gandalf.
And Gandalf means me!
- Gandalf? Not the wandering wizard?
- The same!
Listen.
Thorin and company, at your service.
Dwalin, Balin...
...lKili, Fili...
...Dori, Nori and Ori.
Oin, sir. And Gloin, sir.
Call him Bifur. And him Bofur.
And Bombur at your service.
We are all at your service.
What do these dwarves want in Hobbiton?
They have come for tea, and for supper...
...and for you, Burglar Baggins!
- There's a magic in that music.
- And it moves through me.
- You feel the love of beautiful things.
- To go and see the great mountains...
...and hear the pine trees and waterfalls.
To wear a sword instead of a walking stick.
Just once.
Gandalf, dwarves, and Burglar Baggins...
What is this "burglar" business?
If you prefer, you can say
"expert treasure hunter."
Well, yes, I do prefer that.
We are met tonight in the house of our friend...
...this most excellent hobbit.
May the hair on his toes never fall out.
Hear, hear!
We shall soon start on our long journey.
Our object is, I take it, well-known to us?
All of us?
It is not well-known to me.
Really? Then we must inform our burglar.
We seek a treasure...
...that which is rightfully ours.
Far off in the East...
...beyond the Misty Mountains and the dark Forest of Mirkwood...
...there you will find
Lonely Mountain.
Long ago, this was the home of my people...
...and was ruled by my grandfather:
King Under the Mountain.
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep
Where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells
Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold where no man delves
There lay they long
And many a song
Was sung unheard by man or elves
For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought
And light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword
On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars
On crowns they hung
The dragon fire
In twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun
Undoubtedly, all this wealth was what brought the dragon.
The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red
It flaming spread
The trees like torches
Blazed with light
And below us, in the valley, lay Dale...
...a town of mortal men.
The bells were ringing in the Dale
The men looked up with faces pale
The dragon's ire
More fierce than fire
Laid low their towers
And houses frail
The mountain smoked beneath the moon
The dwarves they heard
The tramp of doom
They fled their hall
To dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon
Curses to the dragon!
Curses to Smaug!
He killed our men and stole our gold!
Curses to the dragon Smaug!
Is this the adventure you've planned for me?
To help you recapture the gold?
None other.
There are 13 of you. Very unlucky.
Mr. Baggins will make it 14.
A splendid lucky number you've found for us.
No arguments.
Let us have the contract.
"To Burglar Baggins:
Terms for your professional services.
One fourteenth of total profits.
Traveling expenses guaranteed.
Funeral expenses, if necessary.
Sincerely, Thorin and Company."
- "Funeral expenses"?
- Do you find the terms acceptable?
- Of course he does!
- But, but, but l...
And so tomorrow begins your greatest adventure.
No hat, no stick, no pipe.
Not even a pocket handkerchief.
How can one survive?
- How did Gandalf get ahead of us?
- He comes and goes at will.
He is a wizard, you know.
Oh, bother burgling and everything to do with it.
Always remember, Bilbo, when your heart wants lifting...
...think of pleasant things.
Eggs and bacon. A good, full pipe.
My garden at twilight. Cakes...
We'll camp here. Perhaps we can find a dry patch to sleep on.
Our lookout has spied something.
Look. Trolls!
Miserable, no-good, robbing trolls!
Where the deuce is Gandalf?
Left us again. Just when a wizard would have been most useful.
No matter. We have an expert burglar with us.
- What have trolls to do with burgling?
- We could use some of their meat.
- Oh, I say!
- Burglar, do your burgling!
Blast! Nothing but mutton to eat!
How I long...
...for a bit of man-flesh!
Bacon and eggs. My fireplace.
Hot chestnuts.
- What the blazes?!
- Help! Let me down! Stop that!
What have we got here?
Let's cook him and find out!
He wouldn't make a mouthful.
But maybe there's more where he came from.
Dwarves! I'm done for! Run for it!
Dwarves?
Now that's a supper.
Let's go get them all!
Let us roast them.
Boil them, says I!
Each to his own, boys!
There's plenty for all.
I likes mine raw.
Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!
The sun!
Blast it!
How did the morning come so soon?
We're done for!
Excellent.
One moment. One moment!
Where's that bumbling Burglar?
Lucky number, indeed!
Over here!
Come see what I've found.
Not bad, Burglar, for your first attempt.
Oh, it was nothing, actually.
We'll keep these.
Deucedly fine blades.
Considering they were made by trolls.
They don't seem like troll blades to me.
Probably stolen.
- See these strange runes?
- Whatever are runes?
Ancient writing. Mine has them too.
Can you make them out?
I am not familiar with these letters.
Well, whoever made them, we've got them now!
Cover up the treasure, men.
We'll fetch it on our return.
Take that, Smaug, you filthy worm!
I see you've also claimed a sword.
Yes. Just a dagger, actually.
But for one of my size, it suffices.
Hurry, men, we must be on our way.
- Hold!
- Hold?
It is time for you to have this.
And what may that be?
This is a map of Lonely Mountain...
...presented to me 100 years ago by your father.
What? Why did it not come to me, the rightful heir?
I've chosen my own time to hand it over.
Oh, I do love maps.
I have quite a collection.
I remember the mountain well enough without this!
Indeed? And how do you intend to enter Smaug's chambers?
Through the main gate, as a houseguest?
You'd be ashes before you took your seventh step.
Oh, see, look!
This hand points from these runes to...
Bless my soul! A secret entrance!
- A hidden passage to the lower halls.
- Excellent, Burglar!
- I'm really quite good with maps.
- Let me see.
Yes, quite correct.
But has it remained a secret all these years?
It's too small for Smaug to use.
It's covered by a door made to look exactly like the side of the mountain.
Here is the key. IKeep it safe.
Of course I will!
But if the secret door is hidden, how do we find it?
- The map doesn't tell.
- It does and it doesn't.
You will understand in time.
Behold, at last, Rivendell!
The hidden valley of the elves, where Elrond dwells.
Simply enchanting!
- But we must be on.
- Pity.
Elvish singing is not a thing to miss...
...in June, under the stars. But...
My dear Elrond, your hospitality is magnificent:
The food, the wine, the stories, the music.
Yes, but we've much to accomplish.
You promised to have a look-see at these troll swords.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, first of all, they're not troll-make.
They must have been stolen.
They were made for the Goblin Wars.
This sword, Thorin, the runes name:
Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!
- And mine?
- Glamdring, the Foe Hammer.
- IKeep them well.
- I will keep this in honor.
- Now show me your map.
- I have it here.
Something strange. Let's see.
Yes, indeed!
There are moon letters here! See?
What are moon letters?
Runes that can only be seen when the moon shines behind them.
They give directions for finding the secret door.
"Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks...
...and the last light of the setting sun...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
This way!
Shelter! A dry cave!
Now get some sleep, men.
We've found the perfect place to camp.
Dwarves have a strange notion of perfection.
And where's Gandalf?
Gone again? I wish I was a wizard!
Hello! What's this?
Look out!
The ponies! The ponies!
Wake up! We're being robbed!
The goblins are upon us!
Save the ponies from the goblins!
Trapped! The goblins have us!
Who are these miserable persons?
Thorin at your service.
We did not mean to trespass.
We were merely seeking shelter from the storm.
He is a liar,
O truly tremendous one.
Ask him to explain his weapon!
This sword is named
Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!
Murderers!
Elf friends!
Stop!
I know that sword!
It is called
Glamdring, the Foe Hammer!
It's Gandalf! Good old Gandalf!
Follow me! Quickly!
Through here! Follow me!
Bilbo!
He's gone!
Where are you?
My precious.
It is my precious.
Hello, my precious.
Bless us and splash us.
Food for my precious.
Eggs and bacon. Spoons all polished.
Warm muffins and sweet butter.
What is that noise, my precious?
My precious does not know.
Bless my soul!
Hello! What's this?
Nice souvenir to show the neighbors back home. If I ever get home.
Who are you?
Bless us, my precious.
A tasty morsel it would make us.
What is it, my precious?
I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.
I've lost my dwarves, my wizard and my way.
Mind you, I'm armed with an elvish blade!
That's better.
Perhaps you know the way out?
But perhaps we sits here...
...and chats with it a bitsy, my precious?
Lt... likes... riddles?
Do I like riddles?
Well, yes, after a fashion.
It must have a competition with us.
If precious asks and it doesn't answer...
...we eats it, my precious.
Oh, I say!
But if it asks us...
...and we doesn't answer...
...then we...
...shows it...
...the way out!
- It seems I have no choice.
- My precious...
...we makes the first riddle.
Voiceless, it cries
Wingless, flutters
Toothless, bites
Mouthless, mutters
Can it...
...guess...
...the answer?
Half a moment.
Is it nice, my precious?
Is it juicy?
Gooey? Yucky?
Is it scrumptious?
If you please!
Wind! Wind is the answer.
Now, my turn.
A box without hinges, key or lid
Yet golden treasure inside is hid
Let us give us a chance, my precious.
Eggs!
Eggs, it is!
Oh, bother!
Us now! Now us, my precious.
I'm aquiver with anticipation!
Now...
This thing, alls things devours
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers
Gnaws iron, bites steel
Grinds hard stones to meal
Slays king, ruins town
And beats high mountain down
Well, interesting.
Yes, now, let me see.
What does it answer?
What does it answer?
Just a moment now!
My precious...
...will it taste delicious?
It will!
- Give me some time.
- What?
What does it say?!
I said time! Time!
Whatever is the matter?
It guess!
Time is the answer!
It is?
I knew it all along.
That's an old one.
Well, fun's fun.
Now, couldn't we get out of here?
It's got to ask us another riddle, my precious!
Blast, I can't think of another one.
Ask! Ask!
Oh, very well.
- What have I got in my pocket?
- Not fair!
Not fair to ask my precious...
...what it's got in its nasty...
...little pocketeses!
I'm sorry. That's my riddle.
And if you can't guess it, you lose and show me out!
My precious loses!
But first...
...my precious shows it...
...his something pretty.
- You wish to show me something?
- My birthday present.
Wait! Where are you going?
My precious finds a ring...
...on his birthday...
...long ago.
A golden ring.
A magic ring!
We must get my precious' birthday present from its hiding place.
Now what?
He'll never guess my pocket contained this.
Bless my soul!
Where is it?
My golden ring! My magic ring!
Lost, it is.
Lost!
Lost!
Curse us and crush us! My ring, lost!
My precious remembers.
He wears it before.
And he drops it on the shore!
Curse it! Curse the Baggins!
He's found it! My ring!
My birthday present!
My, he does carry on.
Bless my soul!
The ring?
Most definitely.
My precious will find it!
Will find it! The Baggins.
My precious will crush it...
...and smash it!
Better douse this.
Where is it?
Where is it?
It is tricksy.
It says it doesn't know the way out...
...but it knows the way in, my precious.
It must...
...know a way out!
It's off for the back door.
My precious must make haste to the back door.
To the back door!
How convenient.
Well, follow the leader.
It's not here, my precious.
It's make an escape!
Ta-ta!
Thief!
Thief!
Baggins!
We hates it!
Hates it forever!
Gollum thought I knew the way out and was trying to head me off.
I merely followed him to the exit.
We had to fight our way through the goblin guard.
- How is it they didn't see you?
- Oh, well...
...the art of burgling is really, you know...
...the art of being unobtrusive.
Invisible, so to speak.
Your story has the ring of truth.
Yes, it rings true.
You need say no more.
We'd best get a move on.
There are still goblins about.
Oh, bother! More mountains?
No. Don't you see?
The sun is setting in the west, behind the mountains.
We're on the other side, to the edge of the land beyond.
- The Wargs!
- With the goblins!
- Help!
- We can't go any higher!
- My arms.
- My poor legs! My legs!
But what will they do with us?
Drop us to our deaths?
Who knows?
But they've brought us a far distance with no dropping!
Behold, the River of Wilderland below!
By thunder!
They're taking us to the edge of Mirkwood Forest...
...to dash us against those rocks,
I know it!
O Great Lord of the Eagles...
...we are eternally grateful for your gallant rescue.
I have not forgotten the arrow...
...that brought me down so many years ago.
I have not forgotten the wizard...
...who found me and healed my wound.
And now...
...farewell, wherever you fare...
...till your aeries receive you at the journey's end.
So this is the Forest of Mirkwood.
Terrible place, if I remember.
And dangerous.
Now, now.
The map shows the safest path.
Follow it closely, straight through the forest.
Don't stray off the track.
If you do, you will never get out.
You speak as if you weren't going with us.
I'm not. I have pressing business away south.
- Oh, no! He can't mean it.
- What will we do without Gandalf?
Please, don't leave us.
I'm already late because of bothering with you people.
I'm sending Mr. Baggins with you.
That should be enough.
- Mr. Baggins?
- Bilbo?
The burglar?
Me? I'm no equal to a wizard!
Nonsense. You are the lucky number.
And you'll soon find out there's more about you than you guess.
You, sir, will be my surrogate.
My replacement, so to say.
Here is paper and a marker.
IKeep a strict log of your journey...
...so I may study it when we meet again and point out your missteps.
I can only do my best.
Then that will have to suffice.
To Gandalf:
As per your instructions...
...I am keeping this log of our journey through Mirkwood Forest.
I shall make good use of it someday as a basis for my memoirs...
...which I intend to call:
There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Holiday.
The days are terrible, and the nights are impossible...
...for we are hungry and thirsty.
The berries which grow here are hideous.
Everything about these woods is unpleasant.
One day we decided someone...
...should climb to the top of the tallest tree and have a look.
I couldn't argue. My contract is vague on several points.
There are moments...
...which can change a person for all time.
And I suddenly wondered if I would ever see my snug hobbit hole again.
I wondered if I actually wanted to.
I awoke the next morning to a hideous surprise.
Now I will give you a name.
And I shall call you Sting!
The rest of the morning
I spent seeking my companions.
And I found them, finally, in a place as black and terrible...
...as a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away.
They'll make fine eating...
...when they've hung a bit!
Go away!
Go away!
Bombur!
I certainly could not let my companions, my comrades...
...become a meal for those hideous spiders. Action was called for.
You are all free. I know the spiders' poisons have made you weak.
But you must follow me. Quickly!
Look! On the path ahead.
There it is.
It has freed our supper.
Now we see you!
We will eat you and leave your skin hanging in the tree.
Grab it!
I can hold them off!
Run to the wood-elves' clearing!
But, how can you...?
I will do the stinging! Run.
Swiftly now.
We've trapped it now.
Close the circle.
It can't escape us!
Lazy lob! Attercop!
Blast! What is it?
What is it called?
Sting! Sting! Sting!
Away! Retreat!
We are no match for Sting!
I joined my companions at the clearing of the wood-elves.
But when I found them,
I was in for another surprise.
The wood-elves had returned, but armed for battle.
The dwarves, weakened by their encounter with the spiders...
...gave up without a struggle.
We traveled all day and night.
Finally, we came to the palace of the Elf King...
...which was at the very eastern edge of the forest.
We'd come all the way through...
...only to end up as prisoners.
- Why did you dwarves try to attack?
- No attack!
We came to beg. We were starving.
Why were you in the woods in the first place?
- That is our business.
- Very well.
Take them away until they feel inclined to tell the truth...
...even if they wait 100 years!
Greed. The fortune we were after was big enough to share with the elves.
They'd make valuable allies against that old worm Smaug.
Instead, they became the enemy, and we were their prisoners.
And even though my invisibility allowed me to move about with ease...
...I had no way of opening the locks.
So it was weeks before I found a way to free my companions.
The river flowed under the caves.
Deliveries of fine wines were brought up the river...
...by human men who lived on Long Lake.
Now, wood-elves enjoy their wine, and the barrels were soon drained.
Oh, stop complaining!
I never promised to burgle you first-class accommodations.
I'd come far, and through many adventures, to see it...
...and now I did not like the look of it at all!
Within hours we'd reached the human colony called Laketown.
A precise, if not too imaginative name...
...for the village was actually built on the surface of Long Lake.
The descendants of the men of Dale still dared to dwell...
...and do business in the shadow of old Smaug's mountain.
I am Thorin...
...grandson of
IKing Under the Mountain!
I have returned!
Hail, Thorin Oakenshield.
I am Bard the guardsman.
We are honored by your presence.
Your grandfather lives in our songs and legends.
What help we can offer will be yours, and we trust to your gratitude...
...when the dragon Smaug is killed and your kingdom is regained.
We were fed, fattened, given supplies...
...and two weeks later found us nearing the end of our journey.
And chances were it would be a very horrible end, indeed.
That smell!
I've not smelled dragon before.
All the halls within must be filled with his foul reek.
And while Smaug slept inside...
...we spent our days searching for that elusive secret door.
Then, one afternoon...
And so, Gandalf, while I wait, I inscribe the final pages of your log.
My only companion is an annoying bird, cracking snails.
"Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks...
...and the last light of the setting sun...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
Oh, my goodness!
Wake up! Wake up! It's happening!
By thunder!
There it is!
Thorin, before it's gone again, use your key.
Well, here we are.
But what now?
Now is the time for our esteemed
Mr. Baggins to perform the service...
...for which he was included in our company.
You must earn your reward.
We do have a contract.
You think it's my job to go in first?
I've already gotten you out of two messes not in the original bargain.
And who will come with me?
Any of you?
I see.
Well, you are the burglar.
Go down and burgle something.
Very well. I won't refuse.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I've begun to trust my luck more than in the old days.
Now you're in for it at last,
Bilbo Baggins.
Why are you here?
You've no use for dragon treasures.
Feel the worm's heat, Mr. Baggins?
A few more steps and you shall see...
...the old dragon Smaug at last.
You can still turn back, you know.
But to go on, to take those steps...
...that would be the bravest of all moments.
Whatever happens afterwards is nothing.
Yes, here is where you fight...
...your real battle,
Mr. Bilbo Baggins.
Do you go back?
Well, thief...
...I smell you, feel your air.
I hear your breath.
Come along!
Help yourself. There's plenty, and to spare.
Thank you, oh, Smaug the Magnificent.
I did not come for presents.
I only wish to have a look at you...
...and see if you are truly as great as tales say.
I did not believe them.
Do you now?
They fall utterly short of reality...
...O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities!
You have nice manners, for a thief...
...and a liar.
You know me...
...but I don't remember smelling you before.
Who are you and where do you come from?
I come from under the hill.
And under the hill and over the hills my paths led.
And through the air.
I am he that walks unseen.
You make riddles?
What is your name?
I am the lucky number, the web-cutter, the spider-stinger...
Lovely titles.
I am he that drowns his friends and draws them alive again from the water.
I am the guest of eagles, the ring-winner and luck-wearer...
...the clue-finder and the barrel-rider.
Barrel-rider, eh?
Then I have guessed your riddle!
You are one of those miserable...
...tub-thumping Lake-men!
You and your town shall pay dearly for this intrusion!
So the Lake-men would steal my treasure?
Wait! You don't know everything.
Not gold alone brought me hither.
Be done with your riddles!
What else brought you, Lake-man?
Revenge!
Revenge?
Surely you realize that your success...
...has made you some bitter enemies.
Revenge? You? Ha!
I am Smaug!
I kill what I wish!
I am strong...
...strong...
...strong!
My armor is like tenfold shields...
...my teeth are like swords...
...my claws, spears...
...the shock of my tail...
...a thunderbolt!
My wings...
...a hurricane!
And my breath...
...death!
Well?
Well?!
Where are your riddles now?
Very, very impressive.
However...
...I have always understood that dragons...
...were soft underneath. Vulnerable.
Especially in the region of the chest.
You have heard wrong!
I am armored both above and below.
Well, I don't know about that.
You "don't know about that."
I shall show you!
Look!
What do you say to this?
Rare and wonderful, eh?
Dazzling!
Marvelous!
Perfect!
Flawless!
Staggering! Mag...
Old fool!
There's a patch in the hollow of your left breast...
...as bare as a snail out of its shell.
What's that?
More riddles?
No, my riddling is done.
I really must not detain
Your Magnificence any longer.
Sorry you could not find me. But a fine burglar takes expert catching.
Burglar?
Burglar!
Thief! Fire! Murderer!
- We should have gone with him!
- To be roasted alive?
It's the burglar!
Three cheers for good old Bilbo!
Thank you! But I'd appreciate a more pragmatic salute.
In other words...
...extinguish me!
There we go! There we go!
Always glad to help a friend.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
Never mind that.
What did you burgle?
This.
What's that?
Earthquake?
Into the secret passage!
Our only chance!
Barrel-rider!
Thieving Lake-man!
Your people shall see my vengeance!
The Lake-people are doomed unless...
Yes! You, who are a mere thrush, and yet so much more.
You have seen Smaug.
You know his vulnerable spot!
Go now, to Laketown. There is a guardsman, Bard. Tell him!
This breeze is strangely warm for autumn.
Bard! What's that?
The dragon is coming, or I'm a fool!
Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!
The dragon! Old Smaug!
Awake after all these years!
The dragon is coming!
Ready? As he passes over...
Arrows!
Stand your ground. Rearm!
Away, you fool bird! Away!
You speak?
Bilbo Baggins?
He found what?
Yes! I'll look.
Jove! You speak the truth, old thrush!
Black arrow, you've never failed me.
I've always recovered you.
I had you from my father and he from of old.
If you came from the true king's forges under the mountain...
...go now and speed well!
Now I am king!
Stop!
There is only one IKing Under the Mountain, and I am he...
...Thorin!
Hail Thorin!
Hip-hip-hooray!
Now, now...
...there's much to be done.
We must catalog our wealth.
Dear me! And pack it for shipment.
Join the fun, Burglar!
Part of this is yours!
Might be mine!
What if Smaug returns?
Oh, he's been gone for a week now!
Found greener pastures, no doubt.
Has this wealth made you mad?
We must find our way out of this mountain...
...and see if he's gone, and quickly!
According to this map, the main gate lies in this direction.
Follow me, gentlemen!
Bless my soul.
What are they?
Is the entire valley floor populated by giant fireflies?
Not fireflies, fires! Campfires!
Nonsense! Only an army would need that many fires.
No, my friend. Two armies!
Bard of Laketown? What did you say?
Two armies!
Smaug is dead. I have slain him.
The thrush delivered your message.
Really? Splendid news, old fellow.
I hoped he would!
My people have made me king.
IKing? Really? Congratulations!
Couldn't happen to a nicer chap.
I don't know how to thank you.
Our town is destroyed and must be rebuilt.
You can thank us by sharing your fortune.
Why, of course, of course.
There's plenty for all.
Wait! The fortune is ours and belongs to dwarves alone!
It wouldn't be yours if Smaug still lived.
A technicality.
- So you brought two armies to take it?
- I brought one army.
The other is mine!
You, who threw us into the dungeon?
My people have suffered greatly from the worm through the years.
We demand retribution.
Never!
Why not? There's enough for all in this mountain.
It's a matter of principle, of honor!
Then tomorrow we take it!
We will meet at sunrise on the field of battle.
You are hopelessly outnumbered.
This is ridiculous!
Quiet! What does a burglar know of these matters?
Then tomorrow it is!
This is deucedly uncomfortable.
I'm certain to get a rash.
That armor was forged in the foundries of my grandfather.
Wear it proudly and it will carry you to victory!
Confusticate and bebother victory!
My only hope is to be taken prisoner as quickly as possible.
Those are the words of a coward.
The coward who flushed out Smaug?
The coward who saved you time and time again?
The coward who always went forward while you cringed behind?
You don't see us cringing now, do you?
This is madness!
Fourteen against 10,000...
...and yet you march off to certain destruction...
...as merrily as if you were on your way to a tea party.
Your kind will never understand war, hobbit.
This is war. War!
Our lookout has spied something!
O great IKing Under the Mountain!
- Balin, it's only Thorin!
- Quiet!
- Yes, general?
- "General"?
Another army approaches from the northeast!
An army of our kind.
An army of dwarves!
- My cousin Dain from the Iron Hills?
- None other!
Ha! Now we are not outnumbered!
Now we have an army!
- A battle of three armies?
- To war!
Onward!
Forward!
To battle!
- Scurvy dwarves!
- Thieving dwarves!
IKill them!
- Chop them!
- Take their heads!
IKill the men! IKill the elves!
Save the gold for ourselves!
I'd rather be back in Hobbiton.
- Who's that old man?
- Get out of the way!
Move, you old fool!
Old fool?
Gandalf!
Halt!
I would speak with the kings!
Dread has come upon you all!
An army of goblins with claim to the treasure comes from the north!
Behold!
They ride upon wolves!
O great Elf IKing, my truest friend and ally.
We must join forces against this kind of scourge.
But of course, O noble
IKing Under the Mountain.
Your people are like brothers unto mine.
My men and all their weapons are as one with yours.
Together we will vanquish the foul foe!
Together!
Thorin is correct. I simply do not understand war.
A battle of four armies.
One, two, three... Yes, four!
Our cause is hopeless!
The goblins are too powerful!
We'll spill much of their blood before the day's finished!
If these be our last moments, let us live them with honor!
Hold! All is not lost.
The goblins have many enemies.
There is yet still another army on the way.
The eagles!
Five armies now?
Mr. Bilbo Baggins, enough is enough.
Bombur! You're hurt!
I still live. And you?
A slight wound. Crack on the head.
Out for hours. What happened?
We won.
Bombur gone too?
Of our original 13, how many are left?
Seven.
And Thorin?
Soon there will be only six.
I have brought him.
Farewell, good thief.
I wish to part in friendship...
...and take back my words at the gate.
There are many words I would take back also.
And does it take this...
...to make us see each other?
- Thorin!
- Hush.
You are no coward, my friend.
I am sorry I so named you.
- This is not important...
- And I was wrong.
You did understand war.
It was I who did not.
Until now.
Farewell, IKing Under the Mountain.
Child of the kindly west.
I have come to know...
...if more of us valued your ways...
...food and cheer above hoarded gold...
...it would be a merrier world.
But sad or merry...
...I must leave it now.
- Farewell.
- Farewell, Thorin.
You take only two tiny bags of gold home with you?
Your share was greater.
It's all my pony could carry, and it's more than I'll ever need.
But you have other prizes.
The ring? Oh, yes.
I'll keep it as a souvenir, in a glass box on the mantel.
And so the prophecies of old have come true.
Smaug is gone and the goblins driven away.
The dwarves and elves live in peace...
...and the men thrive, multiply and build a civilization.
Prophecies!
- What?
- I had a hand in all that!
You disbelieve the prophecies because you helped bring them about?
You don't really suppose...
...that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck...
...just for your sole benefit?
You're a very fine person,
Mr. Baggins. I'm very fond of you...
...but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.
Thank goodness!
Yes, you will return to your home...
...place your souvenir ring on your mantel...
...publish your story, which you believe has come to its end...
What do you mean, believe has come to an end?
It has, hasn't it?
Oh, Bilbo Baggins, if you really understood that ring...
...as someday members of your family not yet born will...
...then you'd realize that this story has not ended...
...but is only beginning.
Maybe you could do better if you'd crawl on your hands and knees.
Come on!
Some day I'm gonna sock that guy...
- right on the beezer!
- Hey, you, Dink. Lay off of that stuff.
If there's any fighting in this family your old man's gonna do it.
Alley-oop!
How much further is it to Tijuana?
About three miles.
Go on, or I'll run on top of you.
- Want me to carry you?
- No! What do you think I am, a sissy?
Say, Dink, if them promoters get me that fight, I'm gonna buy you a horse.
Gee, a real horse?
Certainly. What do you think it is, a wooden horse?
Hey, what happened to the atch-pay
I sewed on the anny-fay?
Gee, I must have lost it.
Does it ow-shay?
Well, I guess it's your underwear.
It'll give you plenty of air... through there, anyway.
Gee, I think that's enough for today, don't you, huh?
You've done swell, Champ.
Ain't he, Jonah?
- Thanks.
- You bet your boots!
Let me tell you something.
Them promoters ain't got a chance of turning me down tonight, have they?
- No, they'll grab you up.
- Here, feel that muscle.
- It's getting big, ain't it, Jonah?
- Sure.
Look at those punch muscles in the back.
I'm just as good right now as I was in the old days.
- You betcha!
- You know I am.
Tell you what you do, you stay here and play with Jonah a little while.
I'm going to run over and play a little of that there Kelly pool.
Champ, you've had enough exercise for today.
This ain't exercise.
This is just a little let-down... a relaxation, you know?
Hey, Champ! Champ, wait a minute.
Oh, no! You know I wouldn't.
Didn't I tell you
I wasn't going to drink anymore?
I haven't had a drink for three weeks and you know I wouldn't take a drink... going to meet them promoters tonight, don't you?
Goodbye.
Champ!
There ain't no pool tables in that place.
Doggone if I didn't forget that!
This one shows him wearing the diamond belt. Looks great, don't he?
There he is, right after the bout with Battling Kelly.
Look at him, not even a scratch.
Sure, he was the greatest fighter in his day.
Now, here he is...
How did that get among these?
Now, this one here shows you his muscular development.
All there, ain't he?
Hey, Dominick, have you seen the Champ?
No, he ain't been over here.
All right, gang.
Wait here, gang. Hey, come on.
Boy, oh boy.
Give me another drink, Louie.
Nix, Champ. Forget it, Louie!
Well, if it ain't a little spitball.
Go ahead, Louie!
Those promoters from Los Angeles are up at the place waiting for you.
Oh, darn it, I forgot.
You can't let them see you've been drinking.
Get some ice and tell Curley to open you a can of tomatoes.
Okay.
They've been there for over an hour.
Gosh, why did you have to go on a binge tonight?
Listen at him bawling me out.
I'm gonna be good from now on, Dink.
- Honest, I am.
- You said you'd behave. Oh, gee whiz!
- Rub his neck with the ice.
- Okay.
- Come on, Champ, drink. It'll do you good.
- Drink? Sure.
No, that ain't what I ordered.
- Boy, you got to straighten up.
- I'm all right.
- Who's dribbling down my back?
- He's coming around now.
Okay.
- See if you can stand up.
- Oh, I can stand up all right.
I'm all right. Your old man's okay.
I'm always okay.
You guys better scram now.
I got him, Jonah.
Okay, Dink.
The air didn't make you feel bad, did it, Champ?
No, I feel good.
- Put your feet out one after another.
- That is a good idea.
Ain't no more than fair.
We can do better than that.
Only, seeing you guys came all the way from Los Angeles...
- Live and let live, that's my motto.
- Sure.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Andy.
Hello.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Business. Hello, there.
- Hi, big boy.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- How are you?
Okay.
There you are, Champ.
- What's your proposition?
- How's your condition, Andy?
He's tip-top. Better than he ever was.
Sure, ain't stopped training a minute.
Hardly.
We got him doing roadwork, skipping a rope, shadow boxing.
Why, only last week he tore up three punching bags.
Certainly. We could've matched him with Gene Tunney, if Gene hadn't quit.
Yeah?
Something I ate.
Booze-fighting and box-fighting don't mix.
You know that.
- I don't get you.
- Why, you're cockeyed right now!
What do you mean, I'm cockeyed?
Just like you were the night you lost the Championship.
Yeah?
Sit down!
You big palooka!
The mug.
Is that all right?
Of all the nights, you would pick tonight to get stinking!
- Yes, and I could...
- Lay off of me will you?
Go on, scram.
You, too, Sponge. Get out of here.
You don't believe what they said about me being drunk... the night I lost the Championship, do you, Dink?
No.
All right.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
I'm gonna lay off the booze, word of honor.
I'm not gonna gamble anymore.
You hear what I said, Dink?
Yeah, I heard you, Champ.
You ain't mad at me, are you?
No, I ain't mad.
- Well, goodnight, Dink.
- Goodnight, Champ.
If the Champ wins this fight, he says he's gonna buy me a horse.
Hey, Kadinkus. Hey, Dinkey.
Here, spit on it for luck.
Attaboy!
You know that cartwheel that you spit on for good luck?
Well, it brought it!
I made 14 straight passes... and doubled up each time.
And was Joe sore!
Oh, boy, he was sore.
Oh, he's burned up.
Get a load of this.
It's yourn.
Thanks, Champ.
Hey.
Genuine Stetson.
Feel the felt.
That's yourn, too.
Thanks, Champ.
Hey, Dink. Come here and have a look.
- Could you go for that?
- You mean the...
The horse, sure. It belongs to you.
It's yourn!
- Where'd you get it?
- Oh, I won it from Joe.
- You did?
- Yeah.
Hooray!
- Gee! Mine?
- Sure he's yourn, just like I said.
- Look at that. Ain't he swell?
- Gee!
- He's a race horse, ain't he?
- Well, he was in a race once.
- What's his name?
- They call him Butterfly.
- Butterfly?
- Yeah.
That's a heck of a name for a swell horse like this.
We got to change it.
I tell you, we'll call him
"Little Champ" after you.
That ain't a bad idea, huh?
- And we can enter him in a race soon.
- Sure. We can fix him up, can't we, Tim?
- I should hope to tell you.
- Gee, can I sit on him?
Well, I guess he's been sat on before.
Alley!
Oops-a-daisy! Hey!
- Hey, give me my hat.
- Isn't he a swell horse?
Yeah, sure he's swell.
Gee. Oh, don't do that.
Somebody might be looking.
Oh, what do we care whether they look or not?
Gee, I'll bet he can go a mile in 20 minutes!
I bet he can go a mile in just-like-that.
How are you today?
Hello, beautiful baby! Baby, hello.
Oh, don't you do that to your mama.
- How is he?
- Great.
Baby, you're gonna win a big old race.
- Mr. Carlton.
- Yes?
I'm from The Herald-Examiner.
Would you and Mrs. Carlton mind...
- posing for a picture with Blue Boy?
- Not at all.
- Thanks.
- Linda.
- Yes, darling?
- We're going to have our pictures taken.
Well, well. Come on, Blue Boy.
Now, Blue Boy belongs to Mrs. Carlton, doesn't he?
- Yes, he does.
- A birthday gift from my husband.
- I see he's a favorite today.
- Who? My husband?
No, Blue Boy.
- My husband's a favorite every day.
- Step just a little closer.
- Like this?
- Just a little closer.
Now, nice smile. That's it.
Fine. That's good.
Say, lady, I wouldn't bet on that horse if I was you.
- You wouldn't?
- No.
If you got any money, you better stick it on my horse here.
- Is this your horse?
- Sure, it's my horse.
Well, he's a pretty good-looking animal.
Pretty good-looking, my eye!
He's gonna win the race today.
Well, I think if you know,
I'll just have to put some money on him.
- What's his name?
- Little Champ.
Little Champ?
What's your name?
Dink. What's yours?
- Linda.
- Hi, Linda.
I think Dink's a pretty name.
- Well, Linda ain't a bad name, either.
- Tony... this young man says that his horse is gonna win this race.
Well, now, that may be a good hunch.
What's the name of the horse?
- Little Champ.
- Little Champ, eh?
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.
- I'll bet $50 on him.
Gee, that's a lot of money.
How about it, Dink? Is that a safe bet?
Plenty safe!
I'd bet my last two bits on him.
Say, Dink,
I don't think I've met your little friend.
Oh, this is Jonah, my pal.
Meet Miss Linda.
- Glad to know you, Miss Linda.
- How do you do, Jonah?
- I'm glad to meet you.
- So am I.
- He's colored.
- So he is.
- Kind of a pretty color.
- Yeah, ain't it, Jonah?
Sure.
Hi, Dink.
Hey, Benny, come here.
Hey, now, listen.
Little Champ is fit to run, see?
As fit as we can make him.
Now, when you start off, you get him up on top, see... and then give him his head and let him roll... and if he starts loafing on you, you just give him the gun, see?
Andy, the guy was right in the next stall to me.
- Who was with him? Linda?
- Yes. There he is now.
Hello, Andy.
- I thought you never came West.
- We're spending the winter in California.
- Meaning...
- Linda and I.
Yeah.
Okay.
- The nerve of that guy.
- What did he say, Andy?
- Oh, nothing.
- Can you beat that?
They're coming out for the fifth race.
Number one is Chester Queen.
Number two, Phillip Ramble.
Number three, Romp.
Number four, Capt. Gilbert.
Number five, Blue Boy.
- Number six, Little Champ.
- Come on, line up that horse!
Number seven, Van Ettish.
Number eight, Selma Bobby.
Chester Queen goes through the barrier.
- Did you place the bet?
- Yes.
Now they're taking him back to his stall.
They're getting set. They're moving in.
Little Champ is fractious.
There goes Little Champ
through the barrier.
Why, Tony, dear, you look as if you had seen a ghost.
Now they're lining up once again...
I have.
They're getting set.
They've lined up evenly.
They're off! There they go!
Going past the grandstand the first time...
Capt. Gilbert leads by a head.
Blue Boy in second by a neck.
Little Champ is third by a half-length.
Blue Boy leading easily by one length.
Capt. Gilbert second by a length.
Van Ettish, fourth by a half-length.
Little Champ dropping back into the pack.
Stop pulling my hair!
Swing around the turn
into the backstretch.
Capt. Gilbert creeping up
on Blue Boy for the lead.
They're well out in front. And now...
Little Champ is moving up on the leaders.
It looks like Little Champ has a chance yet.
Blue Boy is first...
but Little Champ moving up fast.
He's moving up fast.
What a race!
Little Champ is now coming right out
in front. He's out to win! He's out to win!
There they come, down the stretch!
Wow! He stumbled.
What a shame, he had the race won.
There they go, past the finish.
Blue Boy wins!
Capt. Gilbert, second, and Romp is third.
- Are you all right, Benny?
- No, Dink, he's all right.
- He's all right.
- He's killed!
No, he's all right. Here, keep your chin up.
Oh, he's killed, I know it, by golly!
No, he's all right.
How do you know?
Dink, he's all right.
- He's broke his leg, that's what he did!
- No, his leg's all right, Dink.
He's got for sure a broken leg.
- No, keep your chin up. He's all right.
- All right, Dink.
He's all right, Dink. There you are.
- No...
- Look, he's all right.
He just stalled and lost his wind.
Look at that. He's all right, sure.
- Go on and pet him. Attaboy.
- How are you, Little Champ? Gee wiz.
- See, I told you the horse was all right.
- Sure, I told you.
- I told you.
- I told you.
- You're crazy!
- I told you!
Tony! Look at that man with Dink!
Yes, Linda, it's Andy.
I thought so.
- Then Dink is...
- Possibly.
- Oh, Tony, let's go and see.
- No, you stay here, dear. I'll find out.
- Gee, Dink, that sure was tough.
- That's okay.
- Is he hurt?
- No.
- He didn't break his leg, did he?
- Course not.
I was supposed to buy groceries with them two bits I lost.
- What did you do, lose two bits?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, now don't go gambling anymore.
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
Go on, take him over to the stables.
Sure tough on the kid.
Not so good on us, neither.
We're flat again.
- Yeah, well, we've been broke before.
- Yeah.
- Andy.
- Yeah?
- Alone.
- All right.
Is Dink Linda's child?
Well, if I remember correctly, she had something to do with it.
She'd like to see him, Andy.
No, she washed the both of us up a long time ago, didn't she?
Your marriage to Linda was a mistake.
There was no love in it.
Oh, at that time you were World's Champion... glamorous, important.
- She was fascinated.
- Yeah, I wasn't in her class.
That was the mistake.
You came along and she gave me the gate.
Well, that's done with, Andy.
Let Linda see the boy.
No! The court gave me the custody of the kid and I'm keeping him.
- You got a kid of your own, ain't you?
- Yes, we've got a little girl.
Yeah.
- But Dink is Linda's child, too.
- No, she's got you and a new kid.
I got Dink and we remain as is.
She'd give anything in the world to talk to him, Andy.
Money, if you needed it.
If I needed it?
Gee, I'm just crawling with money.
I'm round-shouldered from carrying it around, Tony.
Here's $100 now.
Bring him to the hotel in the morning and there'll be another $100.
Well, I'm not very crazy about doing this, Tony.
When a fellow's got a lot of bad breaks and things are tough... why, he'll do things that he won't do when everything's flush, you know?
- I'll bring him over.
- Thanks a lot, Andy.
Okay.
Now, let's see how you look.
Turn around front.
There's one of those tags.
Now, listen. When you go up there
I want you to act like a gentleman... just like your father is.
You wish something?
Do you have to wish for something around here?
Now you're all set. All right.
All right, Sponge, you take him up there and don't let him out of your sight.
And don't forget that other $100, do you hear?
You leave it to me, boy.
Ain't you coming?
- No, I'm gonna wait here.
- Come on, Dink.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
You got another one of those things right there on you.
- Oh, gosh!
- Can you beat that?
Now, let's see. Turn around.
Take off your hat.
I thought I told you to wash them this morning.
- Well, I washed my ears good enough.
- Well you didn't wash in back.
Now go up there and be a gentleman just like I am.
Don't forget that other $100. Go on.
Everything will be all right, Andy.
I got to go in and collect some dough first.
You wait here.
- I'd like to see Mrs. Carlton, please.
- Come right in. She's expecting you.
Thank you.
Some gum. Gee.
Think I'll take three more.
I'd better not leave any there.
Some candy. Think I'll take some.
What's in here?
Cigarettes.
Boy, I think I'll bring some home for the Champ.
Guess that's enough.
Hi there, Champ!
What are you doing up on that roof?
Get down from there.
Come on, before I knock your ears off.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you like fairy tales?
- No.
Have you read the one about the Sleeping Beauty?
It's about a princess that slept 1,000 years.
That's a lot of hooey.
How could anyone sleep 1,000 years?
It's only a fairy tale.
I'll say it is.
And all the time she was sleeping, didn't she ever eat?
It doesn't say anything about that.
Did you ever try going without breakfast?
Try it sometime and see how empty you get.
And this princess goes for 1,000 years without even eating a sandwich.
- Bushwa.
- I'm awfully glad you're my brother.
The dame's nuts.
Come here.
- How far can you spit?
- I don't know.
You watch me.
- See?
- Okay, Dink. Inside.
Come on.
- Oh, hello, Linda.
- Hello, Dink.
My, I'm glad to see you.
Say, I'm awful sorry about you losing your dough yesterday.
That was all right, Dink.
Won't you sit down?
Ain't that the reason why you wanted to see me?
- No, that's not the reason.
- Ain't it, Linda?
Gee.
This ain't a bad dump you got here, you know that?
- You like it? I'm glad you do, Dink.
- Yeah.
The Champ and me ain't fixed up as swell as this, but our joint's more lively.
It's right above the Greek's saloon, you know.
And I like to listen to the piano playing... while I'm waiting for the Champ to come home nights.
Does he leave you alone at night much, Dink?
No, he takes me pretty near every place he goes... especially when he shoots dice.
I'm good luck to him.
But when he goes on a binge...
I wait up in the room till he comes home.
Then I have to put him to bed.
- Yes, I know.
- You do?
Dink, you're awfully fond of your father, aren't you?
I mean, you like him an awful lot.
Like him? Gee, the Champ's the greatest guy in the whole world.
Gee, you ought to meet him sometime.
I'm telling you, you'd like him.
- I have met him, Dink.
- You have?
Hasn't your father told you who I am?
I don't know. He says you're some dame with a lot of jack.
Has he ever talked to you about your mother?
Well, you see, she kicked the bucket before I was born.
Did he tell you that?
I heard it some place.
Dink, I'm your mother.
- What you trying to do, kid me?
- No, Dink.
I really am your mother. Cross my heart.
Well, then, why ain't you living with the Champ and me?
Well, you see, we disagreed... and I'm married to Mr. Carlton now.
That little girl you were talking to is your little half-sister.
Well, then, you ain't married to the Champ anymore?
Well, then, I guess you're not my mother.
What you crying about?
Oh, Dink. Dink, I am your mother.
Nothing that ever happened between your father and me can alter that.
Well, you don't need to cry about it.
I like you.
- Do you, Dink? Do you?
- Sure.
Dink, wouldn't you kiss me?
Oh, no, Linda, I don't kiss dames.
Oh, please, Dink, just once.
Well, what's the good in it?
It would make me awfully happy if you would.
Well...
Well, they wanted that one thing very...
Well, they wanted it.
- And that was all there was to it.
- Okay, Sponge.
- All set?
- Yeah.
- Bye.
- So long.
Say, come down to Tijuana sometime and I'll show you around.
- Thank you.
- So long.
So long, Dink.
Well, Tony, good... So long.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
Goodbye, Dink.
Goodbye.
Oh, Tony! We can't let that baby stay in that atmosphere another minute... now that we've found him.
I'll never forgive myself.
We've got to get him away from it.
- Tony, we've got to.
- Will you leave it to me, Linda?
Hey, where did you get them cigars?
She sent them to you.
She...
No, don't, Champ, please. I swiped them.
Well, that's different then.
She make any cracks about me up there?
- Suppose she's got a swell joint.
- Smells nice.
Got pretty flowers in the garden, too.
Yeah, I guess you went around and smelled them all, huh?
All I'd do was spit on them.
Yeah, I suppose our place will look like a dump after seeing that place of hers.
Well, did you get it?
Well, what are you holding out for?
Here, Dink, spit on it for luck.
We'll run that up to a million.
Okay, Champ.
Dink, that hit him.
Boy, what are we going to do with all that jack?
First of all, me and Dink is gonna get a new room.
That joint down at the Greek's, that don't smell so nice.
- Maybe we'll leave Tijuana.
- Travel?
Well, maybe, perhaps. You never can tell.
I'm dying on my feet, Champ.
Listen, we can't quit when we're going so good.
I'll quit in a minute.
Dinkey, boy. Andy. Two points...
There you are. That's a natural.
I think we're going into a new business.
Oh, you're sure hot today, ain't you, Andy?
Hit them, baby.
Here, I'll show you how to make a 10.
There you are. Six.
What do you want, a 10?
That's a cinch. There's a 10.
There he comes. There he comes, six!
Andy.
Here, you shoot them.
But use your own dough.
- What's the point?
Well, spill it.
Linda and I have a proposition to make you, Andy.
Yeah?
Give us Dink for six months.
We want to do something for the boy.
Like what?
Well, send him to school.
Give him a different environment.
He's got plenty of environment right here.
I know you love him, Andy, and Dink loves you.
But this sort of...
Oh, give the boy a chance.
Let Linda have him.
I thought she'd pull something like this.
I got to keep counting to keep from smacking you down.
I've got close to $3,000 on that table.
I'm going to send that boy to school and I'm going to be the one... to dress him up.
He and me is going to travel.
If we wanted to be nasty, we could take the boy away from you.
You know, you're not a very good father.
You better go on while the going's good.
Shove off!
Give me them dice. I'll shoot $100!
Let's go home, Champ.
- There's a natural seven.
Don't you want me to spit on the dice for luck?
You? You'd give them halitosis.
Okay, Andy, sign it.
Gee! It is Dink's horse, Whitey.
I must have gone nuts to gamble him away.
Dink will die if he finds it out.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If you can raise the money within a couple of days...
I'll let you have him back.
We won't say nothing, Andy.
Goodnight, boy.
Goodnight.
Dink.
Hey, Dink. We're heading for home.
What time is it, Champ?
Morning.
Come on. You want me to carry you?
No, I got legs.
Did you have bad luck?
Yes.
Well, tomorrow's another day.
Cheer up.
Goodnight, Andy.
So long.
Come on.
No, I can do that, Dink.
Here, you're all tired out.
Give me your hoof.
You ain't feeling sick, are you, Champ?
No. I feel fine.
I got to get up early this morning.
I got to go over to the track and see Little Champ.
You know, I ain't seen that guy... since day before yesterday.
Well... you better sleep late this morning.
Growing kids need a lot of sleep, Dink.
Come on, hop in.
Ain't you coming to bed, Champ?
Sure. In a little while.
Well, goodnight, Champ.
Goodnight, Dink.
And that's McGonnigle.
He won yesterday's race.
Little Champ wasn't running.
Hey, now watch, gang.
Hey, Little Champ!
Hey, what's the matter with you, you old hay-burner?
Ain't you got any sense?
Stick your head out when your master's voice calls you.
Where's he at?
Hey, look!
Gee! Hey!
Hey, bring my horse back!
Hang on!
Wait a minute, that's Dink's horse!
Champ! Champ!
Champ, do you know what they did?
They just took Little Champ away, just now.
Yeah, I saw them.
I lost him last night, Dink.
I'll win him back... just as soon as I can get some dough,
I'll get him back.
Now, listen, Dink... don't take it hard.
I didn't know what was going on... and he went so quick... and well, you know, those things happen... and, gosh, I'm sorry about it.
We're going to get him back.
Come on, get your chin up.
Come on, be a big fellow and get your...
Go on, get that lip up before you lose it.
Come on. Up with the ippy-lay.
Come on. Up with the lip.
Come on now. Give us a smile.
Come on, a little smile.
Attaboy!
I'm going to get Little Champ back for you now... just as soon as I can get a hold of some money.
- Are you?
- Sure I am.
Sure, wait a minute. I got a little old... four-bit piece here you can spit on for luck.
I guess.
No, I don't guess I have.
Well... here, spit in my hand, just for luck.
Attaboy!
Now we're going to get a bankroll, you hear?
And we'll get Little Champ back and...
Thanks, Linda.
Andy, wait.
Andy, won't you reconsider letting us have Dink?
Can't you see the advantages we could give him? A good home... decent environment, friends.
We could send him to a good school.
Andy, he's old enough to decide for himself.
Perhaps he'd like to live with us.
Andy, won't you ask him?
Well... that's fair enough, Linda.
I'll ask him, we'll see what he says.
- Will you, Andy?
- Sure, I will.
- Promise?
- Yeah.
- I'll ask him.
- Thanks.
Eak-stay?
O-nay. Orn-cay.
Orn-cay?
There.
- Utter-bay and alt-say.
- Utter-bay?
- Here. Alt-say and epper-pay.
- Yeah.
- No epper-pay.
- No epper-pay?
- Nope.
- Okay.
Anks-thay.
You're old enough to... make up your mind about what you want to do, ain't you?
- Sure.
- Sure.
And you wouldn't like to go to military school, would you?
- What's it like?
- Well, it's just like a prison.
Everybody has to dress in uniforms... and they have to drill all day... and you wouldn't like that, would you?
- No.
- No.
You wouldn't like to live in a great big home, would you?
One of those great big barns... nothing cozy like... well, like our joint, for instance?
And you have to be dressed up all day... and wash all over three or four times every day.
You wouldn't like that, would you?
- Wash three or four times a day?
- Yeah.
- All over?
- Yeah.
Nothing doing!
You got plenty of environment right here, ain't you?
Sure, I'm full up.
Full up.
So am I.
- Well, I got your horse back.
- You did?
Little Champ? Where is he?
- Down in my barn.
- Gee, that's swell!
Wait a minute!
Come on, Stinky!
Little Champ's back!
Well, you got my money, Andy?
Yes.
Oh, sure, yeah.
How much was that?
You know how much it was.
$300, was it?
Yeah, that's right. I guess you're right.
Wait, don't rush me. Don't push me, now.
Wait a minute.
Let me figure this thing out.
Let's see if you can... guess the number of the bill. Odd or even?
You starting that game again?
Well, l...
Who's starting who's who and what again?
- You keep out of this, will you?
- Shut your face.
- Odd or even? Odd or even?
- I want my dough.
Well, wait a minute. Let's go take a drink... and then we can talk it over.
- Sure, that's what we want is...
- Never mind.
- Go on, get out of here!
- Shut your face.
Come on, odd or even?
I want that dough.
- Gee, don't Little Champ look great?
- Yeah.
Boy!
Sponge says he looks like Man O' War... only he can't run as fast yet.
All he need is practice.
- It' s a beef!
- Let's go see!
Somebody's pinched!
Let's go to the jail and find out who!
Come on!
Last one there's a sissy!
Come on, kill him!
- Come on!
- Give him the raspberry, Dink!
Okay.
Get them out of here!
I ain't going to stand for no...
Nuts!
Looks like your pappy, he done it again.
Yeah.
Ain't you slept?
I've been thinking.
Thinking?
Holy mackerel, what a joint.
You'd think a respectable bedbug would have better sense... than to stay in a dump like this.
Say, who started that beef, anyway?
Oh, I remember.
You started gambling and lost all the dough for the kid's horse.
Then you accused Whitey of using loaded dice.
Then that made Whitey sore and then you sloughed Whitey.
Boy, then things started.
Well, I'd never do a thing like that.
Use loaded dice.
I got caught too many times.
I'm giving Dink to his mother.
What?
I ain't no good.
He'll be better off with her.
You'll have a tough time getting rid of him.
I'll get rid of him all right.
Maybe he'll forget me.
Kids are like that.
Yeah, I know they are.
I had a swell old man... but a couple of years after they hung him,
I forgot all about him.
Champ?
Well, Andy, in again, huh?
Brought you something to eat, Champ.
I'm not hungry.
You take that kid over and pack up his clothes... and then... bring him over to the hotel to his mother.
What for?
Because I said so. You're going to stay with your mother from now on.
Oh, no, Champ, I want to stay with you.
You do?
Well... that's tough because you're just out of luck. You're not going to.
What am I going to do with her?
Well, you're going to go to school... and learn something... and grow up to be somebody.
I'm tired of feeding you.
Let her feed you for a while.
I don't like you anymore.
You're hanging around every place that I go... and I don't like you, that's all.
I won't eat so much, Champ.
And I won't hang around you.
I'll stay up at the Greek's... and wait till you come home nights.
No. No.
I wish you wouldn't send me, Champ.
Gee, I can go to school here.
The Fathers asked me a lot of times.
I could grow up to be somebody.
Somebody like you.
No. You're going to go to your mother's.
I'm not going to have any sniveling around.
You're going to stay with her... and I'm not going to have any more backtalk from you now, that's all.
No, sir, Champ, I ain't going to go.
I'm telling you I ain't gonna go!
- I'm telling you I ain't gonna...
- You're going to go.
- You're going to your mother's now.
- I don't want to go.
Oh, no, I want to stay with you. Please!
You're not going to.
You're going to your mother's, Dink.
- I wanna stay with you...
- No! No! No!
Okay, Champ.
I'll go if you don't want me.
Go on, scram out of here.
Cut it out, Champ!
What are you trying to do?
Gee, I hit my kid.
Don't do that, Champ, you're breaking your hand.
Don't do it, Champ. What's the matter?
You going crazy?
Time to go to bed, youngster.
I've got good news for you, Dink.
I pulled a few strings today and your father's home again.
You mean you got him out of jail?
Thanks a lot.
You know, Dink,
I think you're going to like New York.
You'll like school, too.
We thought it would be nice if you went to the same school I attended for years.
You'll get riding and drilling and target practice.
Was he all right?
Who?
Oh, yes. Yes, he was fine.
Well, did he... Did he...
Yes, he did.
And I told him you were getting along fine.
Well, that's what you'd want me to tell him... isn't it?
Isn't it?
Sure.
Say goodnight to Mary Lou.
Goodnight, Mary Lou.
Goodnight, Dink.
Sleep tight.
Father, come and kiss me goodnight.
All right, dear.
Goodnight, son.
Goodnight.
Hello, Dink.
Just thought I'd help you get settled.
Here's your toothbrush and toothpaste.
Could I help you, darling?
I can undress myself.
Got kind of a little cold, haven't you?
Yeah. You know... my eyes and nose, well... they've been running something awful.
You know?
That's too bad.
Yeah.
Let me help you, huh?
No, I can do that.
Could I take the other one off?
All right.
There we are.
Oh, Dink, you don't know how happy I am to have you here.
Well, I think you better go now.
All right, Dink.
I'll go and see how Mary Lou's getting along... then I'll come back and tuck you in, huh?
San Diego... stop here 15 minutes.
Are you all undressed, dear?
Just about.
Are you nearly ready to be tucked in?
I'm already tucked in already.
Gosh, I'm tired.
See you in the morning, dear.
Okay.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You got to snap out of it, Andy.
Now that we got you that fight with those promoters, you're laying down on it.
You should be doing some heavy training.
Oh, what's the use?
I don't need to train.
All I need is some sleep.
Why, if I could only get a little shuteye, I'd...
We know what you're going through, and we're with you, no kidding.
But we got to grab this chance.
We may never get another one.
Why, if they come up here and find that you're not up and doing...
What do I care?
That don't make any difference.
Let them find me.
Let them take the fight away from me.
What's the difference?
I don't care whether I fight or not.
Hello.
Thought I'd come and see how you was.
You got a cold, ain't you?
No, I'm just sort of crying.
No, no you ain't.
Gee, boy, but you look swell.
Ain't much life to a suit of clothes... but they ain't so bad.
Why, you had a manicure.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, I just scratched it a little bit.
Been feeling all right again?
Sure, I'm feeling fine.
Gee, I'm feeling great.
I haven't had a drink since I got out of jail.
- Yeah?
- And I don't shoot dice no more.
Gee, that's swell.
- Tomorrow I'm going into training.
- No kidding?
Yeah. Feel the muscle.
- Gee, it's like iron.
- Just like steel.
Feel the stomach. Hit it.
Hit it hard.
Hey, did you know
I had a fight all lined up?
- No!
- Sure, all set, ready to go.
Gee, that's swell!
Say, there ain't no reason why I can't come back, is there?
If I do, why, I'll get us a girl that will follow us around... and do nothing but look after our fingernails, huh?
Couldn't we get a couple of men to do that?
Sure. We can get us four men.
And I'll get you a new suit and a pair of rubber boots.
- Real rubber?
- Real rubber boots and a shotgun.
Say, a shotgun that goes "kablooie" and...
Oh boy, that's swell!
And we can travel.
And we can go down to Paris...
- Georgia, and Des Moines, Missouri.
- Oh boy!
- Gee, that's keen!
- Won't that be swell?
Yeah! Boy!
Oh, gee!
- You broke the window!
- What do we care?
Come on, don't get your chin down there.
Come on.
- Come on, hit him in the...
- Chin!
That's what I said.
Andy, you ain't showed a thing yet.
Look at that.
You look at it. I've seen it.
Gee, that guy's good.
Boy, look what he's doing to his sparring partner!
Dink's old man ain't got a chance.
Gee, look at his left.
- It's faster than lightning.
- Yeah.
Boy, he's...
Well, what do you think of the Mexican now?
Come on, Jonah.
That guy didn't look so good to me.
His footwork was terrible.
I don't think he could fight at all.
Not at all.
Gee, Champ ain't got a chance.
But this is a fight he's going into, Tim.
Yeah.
Come on, lop ears. Hot groceries.
Hiya, Dink.
Hello, Dink.
You tired, Champ?
Well, I'm a little tired.
I got a lot of catching up to do... but I'm doing it all right.
I want to talk to you about that.
About what?
Well, about this here fight racket.
I don't seem to like it.
How come?
I thought you was strong for it.
Well, I've been thinking it over, you know, Champ?
I like you lots better when you're not training.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, for instance, when you got a couple of drinks in you... well, you're a lot of fun.
I thought you didn't like me drinking.
Well, I was wrong, Champ.
Now that you quit gambling...
I got practically nothing to spit on.
Well, when I was gambling I lost all of our dough and I lost the horse... and I think we're better off now that I've quit.
We used to have a lot of fun... and now you're training most of the time... and we don't get to see much of each other.
Hey, now, what are you getting at?
Well, you was the World's Champion once.
Everybody knows that.
What do we care about you being champ again?
And fighting this Mexican ain't gonna get you much.
Well, if I win, it will get me $20,000.
- Who cares about that?
- I do.
With that dough, why,
I can send you to school... and I can get Little Champ, and you and me can travel.
Oh, I don't have to go to school.
You didn't go to school, I bet.
Yeah, I know that, but that's the reason that you have to go to school.
Hey, listen... you ain't trying to get me to throw this fight, now, are you?
No, Champ.
All right.
Come on... let's go get some grub.
No, thanks, Champ. I ain't hungry.
I'll see you later.
Oh, gee!
Oh, gee whiz!
Well, what do you say, Doc?
Everything all right?
I guess you'll get by all right.
But you don't want to work too hard at first.
You know, you got to be mighty careful.
That old heart isn't any too strong.
What do you mean?
Well, it's working pretty hard.
Say, listen, the last championship fight, that old heart was doing nip-ups.
Everything was all right.
Come in!
- Well! Hello, Tony!
- Hello, Andy.
- Where did you come from?
- Linda and I came down to see the fight.
Good, good.
Now remember, Andy, what I told you.
Take it easy.
Say, listening to you doctors make those undertakers rich.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I know.
Well, Tony.
Well, I suppose you're back to try and get the kid again, eh?
No, we know we can't do the impossible.
We can't separate you and Dink.
So we're not going to try anymore.
Now you got a lot of sense.
Say, this is going to be some fight.
I'm going to make an enchilada out of this big palooka and eat him.
Say, it's a cinch.
Linda and I have been talking things over, Andy.
We don't want you to take any chances.
Chances?
Say, I wouldn't have that kid see me lose for anything in the world.
Dink's gonna be proud of his old man.
I'm going to win that fight tonight.
Everything is gonna be okay.
- Hi.
- Hello, Dink.
Hello, there. Say, when did you get back?
Couldn't stay away, just had to see this fight.
- Did you put any money on it?
- Did he? I'll say he did.
- Yeah, you're gonna clean up too, boy!
- Andy, will you let's go, we're on next.
Quit your squawking, kewpie. I'll be there.
Come on. Come on, let's go.
Good luck, Andy.
- All right, this as a walkaway.
- Hello, gang!
- Hi, boys!
- Good luck, Andy!
Thanks.
Attaboy, Andy!
- What about the horse?
- Waiting outside.
You got him outside?
I'll have the dough for you right after the fight.
For the love of Mike, Andy. Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The main event of the evening: ten rounds of boxing.
Introducing, at 210 pounds... the former Heavyweight Champion of the World...
Andy Purcell.
At 205... the Heavyweight Champion of Mexico...
Manuel Quiroga.
Bob Perry, referee.
Let's go!
Take your time, boy.
Let him fight himself out.
I'll tell you when to commence.
- Keep it coming up, Andy!
- Up!
Keep that left up, Andy.
You're going swell, Andy.
Keep it up and the fight's yours.
I've given him everything that I've got.
You've got plenty left, Andy.
He hit me a couple of terrible wallops here.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What did you say, Champ?
What's the matter?
Everything's okay. Everything will be okay.
Now is the time, let him have it.
Don't give him an inch.
Let him have it quick.
I don't think he can take them in the middle.
Keep working on that stomach now.
Tear in. Let him have it from both sides.
Go to it, boy. Stay with him now.
Nice doing, Andy!
...three... four, five, six...
One, two, three... four, five, six, seven...
Go on, save yourself. That's the stuff!
Hang on, Andy, save yourself!
One, two... three... four, five...
- six...
- Ring that bell!
...seven, eight, nine...
- Ring that bell!
You're doing fine, Manuel.
You nearly knocked him out.
The bell saved him.
It's all right, take your time.
Give me that smelling salts.
Hey, here's the water.
Frankie, is he hurt?
Is he unconscious?
I'm all right.
What's the use, Andy?
What's the use of going on?
- Let's quit, will you?
- No! I can whip him.
The odds are too big, Andy.
You can't buck him, boy!
No! I can whip him!
Daddy, I'm scared what he's doing to you, that's all.
- No.
- I don't want you to go in.
I'm all right, Dink.
- I'm gonna throw this towel in.
- No, don't! No!
Don't.
I'm surprised at you.
Don't, Champ, please!
- Here.
- Come on, Tim, get him out of here.
Spit on that for luck.
Go on, please, spit on it for luck.
Come on, spit on it, Dink. Please.
Just for luck. Shoot the works.
That's right.
- Andy! To your neutral corner!
- One, two...
- He's down!
...three, four...
They're counting him out!
Get in the corner!
...five, six, seven... eight, nine, ten.
Out!
Well! I better go easy, huh?
Not as good as I used to be?
Great fight, Andy. I'm proud of you, boy.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Have you got the horse?
- Sure, take a look.
- Right over there.
- Yeah.
- Dinkus, look at that.
- Little Champ!
Yeah, he's yours this time for keeps.
- Go and get him.
- Hooray! Whoopee!
Hello there, Little Champ, how are you?
Gee, I ain't seen you in such a long time.
Gee, I'm glad I got that horse.
I am, too, Andy.
Come on, let's go.
Let's get in that dressing room.
All right, Champ.
- Champ! What's the matter?
- Andy!
Frankie, get the doctor. Quick!
- What's the matter, old boy?
- Andy?
Where is he? Frankie.
Doc, he flopped outside.
What's the matter?
What's happened?
Nothing, Dink.
All of a sudden I turn sissy... and faint dead away.
The ground came up... and socked me right square in the face.
I won the fight, didn't I, Dink?
I'll say you did.
Ain't you proud of your old man now?
Gee, Champ, I always was.
And you was going to throw that towel in... and stop the fight.
Ain't you ashamed of yourself?
Champ.
Champ!
Nix, Dink.
Keep your chin up.
Don't cry.
Come on.
Give the old man a smile.
Keep it...
Champ!
Champ, open your eyes!
Look at me!
Champ! Champ!
It's little Dink talking.
Please open your eyes.
Look at me.
Doctor, what's the matter?
What's the matter with him?
Come on now, Dink.
You've got to be brave, son.
Why is the Champ acting that way?
He never has before.
Why doesn't he talk to me?
Well, but the Champ is just tired, you understand.
No, it ain't so.
Oh, God!
I want the Champ!
I want the Champ!
I want the Champ!
Tim understands.
Champ's gone on a trip.
No! Go away! Let me go!
I want the Champ! The Champ!
Steady, Dink. I'm your pal.
I want the Champ! I want the Champ!
Don't worry, Dink.
We'll have a lot of fun from now on.
Oh, that's all right.
I want the Champ!
Dink, be a brave little boy, will you?
Be a brave boy.
Okay.
But I want the Champ!
Dink, everything will be all right, Dink.
Oh, Tony, yeah.
But you... Oh, go away!
Go on! I want the Champ!
I want the Champ! I want the Champ!
Mother?
- Mother.
- Yes, dear.
My baby.
The Champ is dead, Mama.
There, there.
Oh, sweetie... you'll be all right, darling.

»Emil in Lönneberga, he who lived on Katthult farm«
»in Lönneberga parish in the province of Småland,«
»have you possibly heard of him?«
Costume designer; Snapshots
Day-care mother; Grip
Production Coordinator
Producer
»Not one single person in Lönneberga«
»- I can assure you that -«
»did not know of this terrible little boy in Katthult.«
»This Emil, who was up to more mischief«
»than the year has days.«
These poor Svensson family in Katthult had a harsh time.
What's happened now?
Director
"Good grief, he was an impish boy,"
"he second was to none."
"and Emil was the name he had, yes, Emil was his name."
»Yes, poor Svensson's in Katthult, that has such a dreadful boy!«
»One example: His father had left his hat behind at the Katthult stream.«
»What did Emil do with it ...?«
»There was no evil behind it, he just wanted to see if it could float.«
"Good grief, he was an impish boy, he second was to none."
"and Emil was the name he had, yes, Emil was his name."
»Emil was a decent boy, in that he rarely did the same mischief twice,«
»but found out new ones all the time.«
I didn't get a boot out of you, you bastard!
»No, those boots were not waterproof,«
»but maybe another pair.«
»One fine character Emil had, was, that he had a yearn for testing things.«
»In what other way could you otherwise learn?«
Yes, they seem to hold water better than mine.
How could that be?
Emil!
Just you wait!
Open the door, you wicked brat!
I'm not that stupid, am I?
Open!
Oooh!
»This toolshed had an advantage.«
»It could be hasped both from the outside and from the inside.«
»Emil's father hasped it from the outside,«
»when he would prevent Emil from getting out,«
»whilst Emil hasped it from the inside,«
»when he would prevent his father from getting in.«
»Two good and wise decisions!«
Well then, stay there and ponder over your mischief!
You have a need for that!
»Every time Emil spent his time in the toolshed,«
»he carved a funny looking little wood figure.
This must be the biggest collection of wooden figures in all Småland.
»Yes, it was indeed an imposing collection.«
And it is constantly growing ... one by one.
»Katthult was a well maintained little farm, amid apple trees and lilacs.«
»It was surrounded by fields, meadows and grows.«
»This is were Emil lived ... and his father of course.«
»His name was Anton Svensson.«
»And Emil's mother.
Her name was Alma Svensson.«
What's for dinner today?
- Meat soup.
- Yum, I like that!
»And Emil's sister, Ida.«
Good grief, always this meat soup!
»A farm hand, who's name was Alfred, and a milk maid who's name was Lina.«
Keep turning the handle.
- Don't stop!
- "Keep turning!"
I will.
»And Krösa-Maja, we mustn't forget her.«
»She was an agile old crofter's widow living in a cottage in the woods.«
»She was often seen in Katthult,«
»giving a hand with the laundry, with cramming and other work.«
»and frightening Emil and Ida«
»with her ghastly stories about ghost-children, phantoms, wraiths, murderers and other evils.«
»Of course there were also animals in Katthult.«
»Two horses, Hankus and Jullan,«
»two oxen,«
»eight cows and three heifers,«
Cooows!
»three pigs ... ten sheep and lambs,«
»fifteen hen and one rooster,«
»and one cat.«
You're a nice cat, Månsan.
»Emil had two possessions he loved the most:«
»first, it was a cap, that his father had bought when he had been to town,«
»the second was a wooden gun, that the kind-hearted Alfred had carved.«
»Hardly one single day passed, without Emil doing mischief.«
»Peace and quiet, was a rare state in Katthult«
Eeemiiil!
- Oh dear!
»And all Lönneberga was indeed well informed.«
»Because Krösa-Maja ran about and told everyone in the whole district.«
Listen, and you'll get to know what Emil, the wicked boy has done!
»Emil's mother had a fine handwriting.«
»Every evening she wrote down
Emil's mischief in a blue notebook.«
»Emil's father found this needless.«
To what purpose, if I may ask?
All the mischief that brat is doing.
This way, you're wearing our pencil out.
Has that ever crossed your mind?
When I do, I'll buy a new one.
You don't fear expenses!
»Emil's mother made this note:«
»"Help me God with that boy!"«
»"He's spent this whole day in the toolshed."«
»This night something terrible happened in Katthult.«
»But this time,
Emil was not the culprit.«
Why are you shouting like that, dear girl?
It was a rat.
It was running across my face!
- Good grief!
- So we've got rats in the kitchen.
That's a fine thing!
- They can devour our bread and pork!
- And me!
Well yes, but think of the bread and the pork. Better think of that!
Here's the rat-hole.
What a scoundrel!
We must fix that hole.
And Lina, you must have the cat in your bed from this day on.
And I'll place my little mousetrap at the rat-hole.
Fine, but let's go to bed now.
And Lina, try to get yet some sleep.
Soon it's milking time.
Calm down, I'm coming.
»Every morning, when Lina was away milking the cows,«
»Emil's father used to have a cup of coffee in the kitchen, in quiet solitude.«
»He liked to sit like this, all by himself,«
»listening to the birds' singing and to the hen's clucking,«
»drinking his coffee.«
- So, you're arisen this early, Emil?
- Yes, I'm going to set my mousetrap.
Good, but the rat won't be back until this night, understood?
I know, and then it will be caught, that's fore sure.
Yes, rats will fear this day!
How many wooden figures have you made?
Have you counted them?
Yes, there's 97 of them.
I'll be damned!
Have you done all that mischief?
Yes.
»All those wooden figures still exist,«
»but for one, which his mother buried behind the currant bushes,«
»because of its likeness to the dean.«
»"You mustn't depict the dean that way", his mother said.«
I tell you Alfred, when I've got an even 100, I'll have a party here in the toolshed.
- I see. Who are you going to invite?
- Only you!
You and me, Alfred.
You know that.
That's for sure, you and I, Emil.
Now Månsan, you'd better catch that rat for me this night.
"God, the children's loving friend, to me, a child, you peace will send.
Where ever I step ..."
»Now, everyone in Katthult was asleep.«
»Lina was sleeping on a lumpy mattress in the kitchen sofa,«
»as did thousands of milking maids all over Småland.«
»Emils father, mother and little Ida«
»was sleeping in the chamber next to the kitchen.«
»Alfred was sleeping in the scanty farm hand shed,«
»as did thousands of other farm hands in Småland.«
»Yes, every living soul in Katthult was asleep, man and beast.«
»Månsan alone was awake, chasing rats, but not in the kitchen.«
»Emil lay wide awake in his bed in the chamber pondering:«
Maybe it's not that good to place the mousetrap next to the rat-hole.
The rat might become suspicious, when it sees it right away.
Maybe I should place it in Lina's face.
There's where the rat use to walk in the nights.
But she would wake up of course, easily scared as she is.
Under the table ...
That's the spot!
I reckon the rat use to search for bread crumbs there.
And then it'll see the pork morsel.
»Afterwards, Emil went to bed, highly pleased with himself.«
Oh goodness gracious!
Oh, they're shouting with pleasure, because the rat is dead!
Quickly, get down to the toolshed!
When father is free from the mousetrap,
I fear your last moment has arrived.
- Oh God!
- Mother, my gun!
Your gun, well yes.
»Emil's mother locked from the outside, to prevent Emil from getting out,«
»and Emil, as usual, from the inside, to prevent his father from getting in.«
»He thought it was for the better not to see his father in some hours.«
»His mother was of the same opinion.«
»Emil sat down and began carving his 98th figure,«
»and was pleased that he would reach 100, one of these days,«
»so he could have a 100-figure-party.«
»In the afternoon he was let out, as usual.«
- Emil!
- We'll have "palt" for dinner.
- Oh, lovely!
»You might not know what "palt" is.«
»They has just slaughtered a pig,«
»and then you must take the opportunity to make palt.«
»It's made of pig's blood, rye flour and spices and cocked to black lumps.«
»Then fat pork is added.«
»It tastes like blood pudding, but different and much better.«
I'm going to eat eighteen.
Father will never allow you to.
And by the way, you're fed up with one.
- Speaking of father; where is he?
- He's resting outside.
»Usually, Emil's father never took a nap until after dinner.
»He was unusually tired today.«
»I suppose this could happen, if you wake up in a mousetrap.«
»Emil was ashamed when he saw the bandage on his fathers big toe,«
»so he thought of making his father in high spirits again.«
Father, we'll have palt for dinner.
Look!
Look father, what a lot of sludge!
Oh my!
- Oh, help me God!
- Eeemil!
Oh no Emil, hurry down to the toolshed!
You wicked brat!
Just you wait!
Just you wait!
Now dear master Anton in Katthult is finished!
Emil the wretched boy has beaten him into blood!
Try and scrape together just some to at least one or two palts.
Oh no, what's wasted is wasted.
Hi, hi, we won't have anything for dinner today.
»Oh yes, Emil's mother told Lina to make potato pancakes instead.«
»You may not know what potato pancakes are either?«
»It's a sort of pancakes with grinded potatoes added,«
»and it tastes much better than it sounds,
I can assure you.«
No, dinner simply has to be ready now.
It's far beyond dinner time.
Yes!
I'm tired of running here letting you out!
"Sicken blows!"
"Sicken blows!"
Do you intend to run about in the nightshirt all day long?
»Honestly, Emil is not to be blamed,«
»that his father entered that very moment, with a raving hunger,«
»and got ...«
No, the toolshed, Emil!
Is it my fault that dad is in the way, everywhere?
I cannot even set a mousetrap without he getting stuck in it!
»It was not in this way he had in mind to celebrate his 100-figure-party!«
»It was Saturday evening, so he couldn't even invite Alfred as intended!«
"When Herman wooed her, a fumbling start,"
"he was unfaithful and cold in heart."
"Amanda, love, I don't feel no more,"
"another girl knocks upon my door."
"my bride she is as from heaven send,"
"Don't cry Amanda, this is the end."
What a scoundrel!
"Amanda fainting falls down to earth,"
"Those words he said had so little worth."
"Oh God Almighty will punish thee,"
"for being untrue and false to me."
»No, this evening did not turn out according Emil's intention.«
»Is this supposed to be justice,«
»he sitting here in his nightshirt this whole, long Saturday?«
»Emil was angry.«
»But obviously it was the toolshed they wanted him, the Katthult people.«
And their wish will be fulfilled!
»In this very moment,
Emil took a dreadful decision.«
»He intended to stay in the toolshed for the rest of his life.«
»Lonely and abandoned of everybody,«
»he would stay here until his life came to its end.«
Then they finally will be content!
But don't you try enter the toolshed!
Then I'll fire!
Emil. Emil, dear.
You've nothing to fear any longer.
Father has calmed down, so you can come out now.
Ha!
Why do you talk like that?
Come out now, Emil.
I'll never come out again!
And don't try to come in.
I'll shoot if you do!
Please come out, so that we at least can have a talk.
... but ... Emil ...
- Emil!
- I said no!
Emil is in the toolshed, and says he'll never come out again.
What kind of twaddle is that?
You must go there and bring him to reason, Anton.
Well then, you'll come out when you're hungry.
Ha, ha!
»Emil's father didn't know about the box
Emil had hidden in the fireplace.«
»A handsome little food supply, oh yes indeed!«
»Being a cunning boy, he'd made precautions not to starve to death in the toolshed.«
Or I'll have to use brute force, because you cannot stay in there the whole night.
Just you try!
I'll shoot the first person that enters!
Emil ... come out and let's go to the lake for a swim, the two of us.
Oh no! Just you be sitting on that bench with Lina!
Be my guest!
I stay here.
He can remain in there until he's bored.
Let's go to bed.
- But ...
- Come.
- Always the same. Always.
- But, Anton.
- Now he won't even let us sleep at night.
- But ...
I wish we could be sure he indeed will stay there, that wicked child.
That would really please me!
»This was a cheerless Saturday evening.«
»Of course Emil's parents missed their little boy,«
»who usually sleeps in his little bed in the corner«
»with his furry head on the pillow«
»hugging his cap and his gun.«
"Amanda goes to the nearby lake,"
"her bond with life she intends to break."
"Fare-well you brute, who turned love to ice,"
"One day we will meet in Paradise."
I'd like to have had a word with that Herman.
- ... Why?
- A promise is a promise!
Don't forget that, Alfred.
But I cannot be blamed for what this Herman did?
Just you don't do the same!
But I haven't promised you anything, have I?
Yes you have!
I could go with Alfred for a short swim, and sneak into the toolshed afterwards.
Yes, I will!
»Emil was certain who had hasped the door from the outside.«
I'll show her, that hag!
Hello old moon, look at one who can really climb!
- What's the matter?
- Look, a "myling", on the roof!
No ... I recognize that little myling.
»A "myling" was the ghost of a dead child.
In old days everybody in Småland feared them.«
»Krösa-Maja had told many a ghastly story about mylingar.«
Come down, Emil!
Oh no!
I will pull down this toolshed and never again be placed in it!
Come down and let's go for a swim.
Jump!
What do you say about Lina? She thought she saw a myling!
Well then ... that's what I got out of this Saturday evening.
You're in fact a good swimmer!
Yes, thanks to you, Alfred.
You and I, Alfred.
You and I, Emil, that's for sure.
»That's the end of that day,«
»but more days followed with more mischief.«
"Now I'll let you know how he got in the bowl with meat soup"
"headfirst made a deep dive, and jammed he was indeed."
"in his mother's soup bowl
'cause his ears was far too big,"
"So they went to town to the doctor in great speed."
"Good grief, he was an impish boy, please listen to my voice."
"If you one only soup bowl have, don't fill it up with boys."
»This day in Katthult they had meat soup with vegetables for dinner.«
Do you have to slurp like that, Emil.
Yes, otherwise you don't know that it's soup you're eating.
»Everyone had his fill, and then the bowl was empty,«
»but for a drop at the bottom.«
»Emil had decided to get that last drop.«
»The sole way of getting access to that drop,«
»was to put the head in and lick it up.«
I'm jammed!
My dear child!
- Just a second and I'll help you out.
- A dimwit's acting!
Why on earth should you put your head into it?
That's nothing to be done about!
He's trapped.
Oh, this lovely soup bowl! In what do we serve the pea soup on Thursday?
Did you think the boy should stay in the bowl until Thursday, you silly?
Good Lord, what do we do now?
We'll have to use the poker,
- and break the bowl with it.
- Are you out of your mind?
- The bowl costed 4 crowns!
- Let me try.
Poor Emil.
Don't worry, Emil.
- I've never seen anything like this!
- Stop it! Stop it!
Put me down.
Let me go, don't you hear me?
Emil is crying.
No, I don't!
It's meat soup.
We must make use of the poker.
That cannot be avoided.
That must never be done!
The bowl costed me 4 crowns.
We'd better go to the doctor in Mariannelund.
He only charges 3 crowns.
In that way we gain 1 crown.
A good idea! Let's do that.
Buy something for me at the same time.
Buy and buy!
I never hear another word.
Harness the horse, Alfred.
We'd better be at the doctor's before he closes.
»Yes, all of a sudden they were all in a hurry in Katthult.«
I simply have to tidy him up a little, if it can be done, since he's going to the doctor.
- We cannot comb his hair.
- No, that cannot be done.
And we cannot wash his ears.
No, but that's a necessity;
I know that for sure.
I have to have a go for it just the same.
- Outch!
- What now then. Outch!
- Oh no!
- What now then?
I'm jammed!
Yes, that what happens.
Are you out of your minds everybody?
Who's the next to squeeze himself into that bowl?
By all means! Do that!
We'll take the big hay-cart.
I can take everyone in Katthult to Mariannelund.
No, we must leave your ears as they are, all the same.
- Then I had some benefit of this bowl.
- Yes.
This misery, will it never end; year after year always the same!
Good luck!
This will be a subject in Lönneberga.
Well yes, I reckon you'll see to that, Krösa-Maja.
- Look after little Ida carefully!
- Yes, I will.
See you, Emil!
- Good bye!
- And good bye with the soup bowl.
What on earth is this ...?
Oh, that little brat! Poor Svensson's, that's all I have to say!
- Oh look!
- It must be Emil. Emil!
It's amazing, all that he can find out!
Here we go, becoming a common laughing-stock.
- It's not that fun.
- No, it isn't
But remember that you'll gain 1 crown.
You don't do that every day.
- He couldn't be by his senses!
- No!
- Good afternoon, Jocke. How are you?
- By all means.
It is a peculiar hat he's got, Emil.
Are those in fashion?
No they're not!
»It was all but often
Emil visited Mariannelund,«
»so he enjoyed himself all the same,«
»though he saw nothing but the tip of his boots«
»beneath the rim of the bowl.«
"Up and down, down and up, piglets crow in spruce fir top."
"and a mouse in our house swears and wears a blouse."
"Lambs drink brandy, eggs are filled with candy."
"Dogs are meowing, pigs and hogs they crow."
"Up and down, down and up, piglets crow in spruce fir top."
"A cow gallop, a sheep on top, halt please, I say stop!"
Here you see the prince, riding on his horse.
Oh my, how did this happen?
A mishap, nothing else.
- Are your ears cold, lad?
- No.
What use do you have of that gizmo on your head?
Otherwise my ears would be cold.
»Emil did indeed know how to gain a laughter.«
Next please.
I find your case more serious, so you can go first.
Oh tank you, can we really?
Thank you!
Just a minute, please.
I read here that you have a cough plus chest-pains.
No, what really is the matter is that our son ...
Well, he's got jammed, our son.
How do you do ... in there?
I'm fine, thank you.
There flew 4 crowns away!
So, it costed 4 crowns, that bowl?
I daresay, that was a blessing in disguise for you.
You see, I charge 5 crowns, sometimes more.
Pulling a head out of a soup bowl is no easy matter!
5 crowns?
I thought you only charged 3 crowns, sir.
Upon my honour no, 5 crowns, not an "öre" less!
But now the boy has managed to cure himself.
He did yes. Yes, he did!
Then we won't have to pay at all?
No, you haven't.
That's ... that's really pleasing.
Be my guest.
You'll find a dustbin on the outside.
There you can throw away the shards.
Good bye.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
Dustbin! Over my dead body!
We can glue this together.
Just think of it; we have gained yet a crown!
What should we but for that one?
Buy!
We're not going to buy anything!
It was nice of you to fix it, so we didn't have to pay anything.
So it's only right that you'll have 5 öre.
- Thank you.
- You can put it in your piggy bank.
»Had Emil been an ordinary kid, nothing else would have happened this day.«
»Bur Emil wasn't an ordinary kid.
Guess what he did?«
Oops!
- What's the matter?
- The 5 öre coin!
- It's in my stomach.
- Good gratious, is that really so?
Yes!
Father, how are we going to get the coin out of our boy?
We must return to the doctor's.
So, that's how you have figured it out?
You want me to pay the doctor
5 crowns to get out a 5 öre coin?
What marks in maths did you have in school?
I'd surely want to know that!
It is in here, but I don't mind.
I can be my own piggy bank, and keep the 5 öre coin in there.
You're out of your mind both of you.
Anton, I didn't mind when he ate his trouser buttons, but a 5 öre coin!
This could be bad for him, believe me.
A coin is much harder to digest.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
- So you mean it could be dangerous?
- Yes!
Then let's return.
So, did you forget something?
- No ...
- No, this time Emil has swallowed a 5 öre coin.
A 5 öre coin. I daresay!
And he did swallow it?
Yes, our Emil is capable of anything.
Well would it be possible to let him have an operation for 5 ... 4 crowns.
And you can keep the 5 öre coin!
Nice try! It is my coin!
No, an operation is a bit to overdo it.
Believe me, the coin will come out on Thursday, at the very latest.
Nature will fix that, I promise.
But you must eat four buns.
You see ... the coin could use some company, in order not to irritate your stomach.
What do we owe you this time; for the prescription I mean?
Nothing!
- Thank you.
- Very pleasing, thank you!
- Thank you, sir.
- Good bye.
- All right.
Next please!
He didn't charge anything.
Just imagine all that money we've gained!
We've never done this good business before!
True! He's a good doctor.
Let's go to the baker's and buy buns for Emil.
Never in a lifetime. Buns!
We have buns enough at home!
- I'm hungry now!
- Yes, Anton.
If a can borrow 5 öre, then I can buy my own buns.
And I'll pay you back in a couple of days.
- Sure as eggs are eggs.
- Really?
The best medicine I've got in my entire life.
"Still going strong he is my horse,"
"limping on all four he does of course,"
"but I do not care!"
»Emil's father showed unusual mirth.«
»It was a long time since he'd made this good business.«
"... on this smooth road!"
Lina, they're coming!
They're here!
Home sweet home!
My dear little Ida!
Come to mother.
- Oh my!
- Yes indeed ...
... provided nobody touches it.
Did you hear, Alfred? Meat soup will be served once again in Katthult!
It's a very nice soup bowl.
Lucky that father could mend it!
How could you get your head inside it in the first place?
Easy as duck soup!
I just did like this.
Outch, I'm jammed!
You wretched child!
No!
»Two days later Emil's father got back the 5 öre coin; a small comfort.«
Here you are.
At least I do pay my debts.
»This is the story about Emil in the soup bowl.«
"Listen now my dear friends,
I will tell you all a story,"
"What Emil was up to a sunny day in May."
"Up the Katthult flagpole he did hoist his little sister,"
"Looking at her when she was floating in the wind."
"Good grief, he was an impish boy, but Ida was content."
"She was maybe the only child, who could sail in the air."
»There was to be a party in Katthult this Sunday.«
The cow is about to calve!
Hurry!
Must she really calve today, when we're having a party?
- It's Broka. We must have a look.
- No, not now, not when you're neat and clean!
Oh, it's high!
Yes, we do have a high flagpole.
If I was up there, I probably could see Mariannelund.
- Shall I hoist you up?
- Don't be silly. That cannot be done.
We don't know until we've tried.
I do want to see Mariannelund!
And you will!
»Now the guests arrived in a long row, and the flag was hoisted.«
»One of the guests was the refined Mrs Petrell.
She came all the way from Vimmerby,«
»to taste the delicate, homemade sausage of Alma Svensson's.«
»And the dean with his wife.«
»Refined and well-bred people was seen at this party; indeed not only peasants.«
How do you do, my dear Mrs Petrell?
- What a blissed weather we have!
- Yes.
- Yes indeed. A true weather for a party.
- How wonderful to be out in the countryside!
Tell me what you see from up there.
- All sorts of things.
- Tell me.
I can see the Lönneberga church.
- Don't you see Mariannelund?
- No.
- Shall I let you down?
- No, I like to see Lönneberga.
Ah ... and the flag is hoisted, of course it is.
»Mrs Petrell was very near-sighted, so this is what she saw:«
»something red and white that showed no likeness to the Swedish flag.«
- Welcome.
- Howdy.
Excuse me for not greeting you,
We had a calving cow. She simply had to calve this party day.
Dear Anton, you must give me an explanation to this.
Why have you hoisted the Dannebrogen?
... Well Anton?
»"Dannebrogen"?
Emil didn't know that word.«
»He didn't have a clue that this meant the red and white Danish flag.«
»But this he knew that the red and white up his flagpole«
»was not a Dannebrog.«
Thast not a Dannebrog.
It's just little Ida.
It's just me.
I can see all Lönneberga
Ida!
You wretched child!
What are you doing?
No!
I want to stay up here.
Don't put me down.
Oh no ... Ida!
I want to stay up here.
What did I tell you?
- Ida!
- Wretched child!
Now it'll be the toolshed ... for life!
- She wanted to see Mariannelund.
- So, she wanted it herself.
- She wanted to see Mariannelund.
- Bah! Now it's the toolshed for you.
- She did want to see Mariannelund.
- Stay here ... and ponder over your mischief!
And ponder over your mischief!
I simply do not accept this!
But I don't care about their old party.
Goddamn, what a lot of nettles!
»It was easy to work up an appetite in this larder!«
»Smoked hams and sausages were hanging in the ceiling,«
»and round "palt breads" in long lines.«
»Emil's father liked "palt bread" with pork and white sauce.«
He was very old, this Johansson.
Oh dear, we've forgotten about Emil!
He's been sitting in there far too long.
Please Anton, go and let him out.
Well ... my intention was never to keep him there this long.
Maybe not, but we've had some peace and quiet.
You can come out now, Emil.
- Emil is not here.
- What? ... How remarkable ...!
Where could he be?
He must have escaped through the window, that imp.
This cannot be!
No feet has trodden in these ...
At least not a human foot.
Could he have flown away?
Oh yes he can!
He could have been turned into a dove.
I cannot see a single dove.
Maybe that is Emil?
I doubt it, my little Ida.
Alma. Alma!
Emil has disappeared.
»Lina used to sing about a poor girl who was turned into a dove and flew to Heaven.«
»So why couldn't Emil have been turned into a hen?«
He couldn't be else where but in the toolshed. Don't you see that?
But he isn't!
Where is he then, if he isn't in the toolshed?
Look for yourselves.
Emil!
What are these?
He's gone; that's for sure.
Who on earth has made all these wooden figures?
Nobody but our little Emil has made them.
And now he's gone!
Emil, don't fly to heaven!
I'll give you chicken fodder as much as you can eat, as long as you stay in Katthult.
Come forth, Emil!
»Poor people in Katthult, they searched and searched!«
»They searched in the woodshed and in the mangleshed, but no Emil.«
»In the sheep house, in the hen house, in the laundryshed, but no Emil.«
I know. The subterraneans must have taken him, the goblins.
They will regret it! Tell the subterraneans that, with my greetings.
»They searched the stable, the barn and the pigsty, but no Emil.«
»Then they looked in the well.«
Maybe The Old Man in the Well has caught him.
- If so, he's finished!
- Come forth! Where are you?
»But no Emil.«
»Then everybody headed for the stream.«
»Luckily he wasn't found there either.«
Yes, "Näcken", the evil water spirit has taken him!
He always covets children.
Children are easiest to capture.
Bah, Emil will break that habit of his in no time!
... should it at all be Näcken, who has him.
Bah, Näcken hasn't got Emil.
Of course he must be somewhere.
Don't despair, he will turn up.
No ... I don't think so.
I had hoped this would be a fine and merry party.
He ... he ...
Anton ... what on earth shall we do?
It's time to bring forth the food.
We cannot let the guest starve to death.
They're invited to dinner.
We'd all better return to the house!
Wasting the food won't ease our troubles.
»Well said of Emil's father, because everyone was hungry from all the mourning and searching.«
Alma ... the sausage.
The sausage? ...
Oh my, I've forgotten the sausage!
Lina, go and get the sausage, will you.
Well, many a child has disappeared and never turned up again.
We all know that.
My dear Krösa-Maja, we mustn't think of the worst, really not!
What's the matter with you?
Where's the sausage?
If you all please follow me,
I'll show you something.
What foolishness is this?
Follow me ... and I'll show you this foolishness of mine.
You do have an odd milk maid.
Yes, she differs from all milk maids in Lönneberga, but let's join her.
What are you up to, Lina?
- Emil, our little boy!
- Oh yes, Emil, sweet little Emil.
He isn't turned into something.
At least not that much.
Is he alive?
Yes, praise be to God, he's alive!
Wake up, Emil.
He has obviously been eating sausages.
Right. Now maybe you know why I couldn't bring you any sausages.
You really did frighten us, my little Emil.
»Imagine how one tiny boy, found stuffed with sausage, could create such great happiness!«
He's alive, and that's all that counts.
- Oh yes.
- No matter the sausage!
But I left one behind.
I know I did.
- We must give that one to Mrs Petrell.
- Yes.
She's second to no one but Emil, devouring sausage!
»The evening darkened and the party in Katthult came to an end.«
»The guests returned to their own homes.«
Give my gratitude to Emil for saving one sausage. That was very civil of him!
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
»Everyone was content.«
»They'd all got a new story«
»about poor Svensson's in Katthult and their impish boy.«
»Autumn was gloomy with rain and rough weather.«
Hey there, you lazy ox, this day is not ended yet.
Do you hear that, you lazy ox.
»Lucky for Alfred, he had little Emil as a discussion partner.«
»They had an important subject to examine.«
Lina both acts as and believes that you're going to marry her.
But you don't intend to, Alfred?
No, I dare not.
The worst, however, is that I dare not tell her.
Do you want me to tell her?
I dare, I promise I do!
Well ... you must say it properly, nicely.
You cannot rush straight ahead!
"My Alfred the sweetest thing for us, for you and me,«
»is to rest in the graveyard side by side."
"Where no delusive friends may ever do us part,"
"In Heaven we wed, I'll your bride."
"And now the floor is shining, tjo littan, littan lej."
Now Månsan it's time for you to catch the big barn-rat.
You wicked child, look what you have done!
I'm scrubbing all day, trying to keep the house clean, then you bring half Småland in the kitchen.
- Indeed!
- Calm down, Lina.
Yes, you stick to him, whatever he does!
Get out!
She's so meticulous.
Marrying her is not an easy bargain.
- No.
- My gosh!
»The autumn darkness fell heavily upon Katthult.«
»Already 3 o'clock PM the kerosene lamp in the kitchen had to be lit.«
»And everybody in the kitchen was busy with his and her own tasks.«
Emil's mother spun a nice, white yarn for socks to Emil and Ida.
Lina and Krösa-Maja carded the wool.
»Emil's father was pegging shoes,«
»and saved a lot of money, they otherwise must have paid the shoemaker.«
»Alfred mended his own socks, and that was highly needed.«
»Emil and Ida was playing under the drop-leaf table«
»like children in Småland have made for centuries.«
Oh my, can you wear out shoes, Alma!
The way you're walking,
I'll have to buy a new pair of shoes.
Continually, continually!
- At least every tenth year.
- Right you are.
Your shoes could be spared a step now and then.
You could go with bare feet.
- At least in summer.
- Yes, and jump on one leg in winter.
What on earth are you doing?
We have a wolf under the table.
Emil says that Månsan is a wolf.
If so, you have never seen a wolf.
- Have you?
- Indeed I have!
In the old days, wolfs roamed Småland in big packs.
We were greatly infested by them here in Lönneberga.
All handy men dug deep wolf pits.
Many wolves fell into them and were shot.
One winter evening when I was young,
I heard a pack of wolves howl in the woods.
By cracky, did I run!
Then you must have been afraid, Krösa-Maja?
Indeed! ... But can you guess what was even worse?
No, what?
There were also werewolves!
Werewolves, what's that?
A werewolf is ... no, I don't even dare to mention it.
A werewolf, well ... one part is a man, the other part is a wolf.
He's out stalking at night when the moon is full.
He's almost like a ghost, you see.
Good grief!
Should you meet a werewolf in the night, you're done for!
A more gruesome beast doesn't exist.
People should stay at home at night, if you ask me, and not run about in the moonlight.
Right!
Krösa-Maja, please don't frighten the children like that.
Yes, please do! Tell us about murderers, ghosts and mylingar and all this.
- Oh no, no more stories.
- But tell us at least how to dig a wolf pit.
»Next morning, Emil started to dig a wolf pit.«
»He thought that once you have a wolf pit, you'll soon get a wolf.«
The main thing is to get it ready before the snow.
When the snow comes and the cold, then the wolves leave the woods.
Good grief!
By the way, I think Alfred will give me a hand.
»And he did, otherwise the wolf pit would never have been finished.«
When it's covered by snow the wolf will fall right into it.
Wham, and there he is!
- Yes, wham, and there he is!
- Wham, and there he is!
»Now he longed for winter to come, and one day it was there.«
»Winter came some weeks before Christmas, and the snow was falling for days.«
»Katthult was covered by the snow, and Lönneberga, and all Småland.«
»This was a busy time! In Katthult Christmas was thoroughly celebrated with lots of food.«
»Room was scarce, due to all the different sorts of sausages piling up,«
»and hams, brawns, meatballs and a lot more.«
»Everything had it's origin in the newly slaughtered pig.«
»And candles!
Candles were important at Christmas.«
»Emil's mother and Lina worked almost a whole night, making candles.«
»Big candles, small candles, branched candles.
Christmas must shine!«
»Emil's father found some oats sheaves he'd saved for the sparrows.«
This is one big waste of food ... and foolishness.
But sparrows must also eat at Christmas.
Hmm, I think I'll save this for next Christmas.
Yes.
»Everything living must eat at Christmas.«
»All the "fattighjons" in the workhouse.«
»You might not know what a "fattighjon" is and a workhouse?«
»Be pleased that you don't have to know.«
»In old days every parish had its workhouse.«
»Imagine a miserable cottage with two or three rooms,«
»a filled with poor, worn out and aged persons,«
»sitting there idly in filth, lice, starvation and misery,«
»then you know what a "fattighjon" is and a workhouse.«
So, Jocke, there you are!
What did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you to keep indoors?
He wasn't far away this time.
I caught him within minutes.
Don't do that again!
I've other duties than chasing you.
And you don't have wits enough to cope on your own.
Do you understand?
Look, she walks like a roaring lion amidst the sheep.
»This was about "The Commander".
She was in charge in the workhouse.«
»Emil's mother had sent her son to the workhouse with some food for Christmas,«
»sausages, ham, brawns and more,«
»and a box of snuff for Albert's grandfather.«
Enter!
Oh, who is coming?
Isn't it Emil himself?
Mother has sent me with some food for you, Christmas food.
God bless her!
Yes, God bless her!
She has a good heart.
That dear mistress in Katthult!
She knows the need of the poor.
The snuff is for Alfred's grandfather only.
So ... well then, he'd better get it.
- Merry Christmas everybody!
- Merry Christmas!
Give your mother our greatful greetings.
I will.
Let's have a look.
- Couldn't we eat some of it right away?
- That would make you happy, wouldn't it?
On Christmas Eve will this be eaten!
- I am so hungry.
- Not until Christmas Eve.
I'll put it in my cupboard in the attic, and God have mercy upon the one who touches it!
»Christmas is here.«
»Emil was silent and calm all trough the Christmas Day service.«
»He behaved so well, that his mother had to write this down in the notebook.«
»"That lad is really pious,"«
»"and at least he does no mischief in church."«
»Emil and Ida were playing with their Christmas gifts,«
»and Katthult was half asleep in peace.«
»This day was Boxing Day,«
»and Emil's parents were invited for a Christmas feast in Skorphult,«
»at the other end of the parish.«
»All Lönneberga knew about Emil ... so the children were not invited.«
»It was Lina's duty to stay behind as babysitter, but she urged to join the others in the sledge.«
»She wished to visit her mother, living in a cottage near Skorphult,«
»and she whined for not being allowed to go.«
Don't whine like that, Lina.
You may come with us, for God's sake.
- Oh can I really?
- I'll take care of the children.
But you know Emil!
Emil is a sweet little lad. At least he does no mischief at Christmas.
No mischief! Understood?
- Did you her that?
- Yes.
Giddap!
Let's have some fun!
Sicken blows!
Sicken blows!
He's not here yet?
Strange.
Where could he be?
He must have gone to Katthult ... as always.
What business does he have in Katthult?
I reckon he has one or two things to discuss this time.
What do you mean by that?
Klossan, go to Katthult and get
Stolle-Jocke back here. Immediately!
- What ... you don't mean that!
- Yes.
I must have my gun, and put The Commander to death!
Calm down, Emil.
It's risky to be that vexed!
I don't care, because now I am vexed!
Look, Lill-Klossan is coming!
- Yes, she is.
- To bring me home.
Yes indeed! She had hidden all of it in her cupboard in the attic.
And when she brought it forth on Christmas Eve, a tiny stump of a sausage was missing.
Then she was raving mad, and she said, if that person, who had stolen the sausage did not confess ... then you'll have a Christmas Eve, that'll make the angels in Heaven cry.
And that how it was.
All Christmas trough we have had nothing but rancid herring to eat.
But The Commander ... she sat on her room, and ate blood pudding and sausage, so that you wondered why she wasn't filled up to her ears.
I watched her once every hour.
She did nothing but eat, and eat and eat.
And every now and then she used some of Jocke's snuff.
My snuff.
We'd better go now, Jocke.
The poor are surely to be pitied, grandfather.
I know a person who will have a big feast!
- Who?
- I will!
I'll invite all the poor in the workhouse to a feast here in Katthult. At once!
Not The Commander ... or?
No, but the others.
Emil, are you sure this is not a mischief?
Well Emil, is it?
No, it isn't. It's that sort of scheme that'll make God's angels clap their hands.
- Mother would like it too.
- But father ...?
Emil worked his will ... he always did.
"Up and down, down and up, piglets crow in spruce fir top.
"And a mouse ..."
»At the same time The Commander used the last of Stolle-Jocke's snuff.«
»She was a bit mournful, as often happen when you have done wrong,«
»and have eaten too much food.«
- Good evening.
- Good evening, dear Emil.
Oh, little Emil.
What do you want?
Did I possibly forget my clasp-knife at my last visit?
No Emil, I haven't seen a clasp-knife.
Have any of you seen Emil's knife here?
No, I haven't seen it.
No Emil, no one has seen it.
Then I must leave you.
Was the food to your liking?
The sausages and the brawns?
Oh yes, oh yes ...
Give our greetings to your mother; everything was so tasty.
I will when she comes back.
Mother and father are at the feast in Skorphult today.
The Christmas feast in Skorphult!
So, they're having a feast?
To be sure! And seventeen curd cakes!
How about that?
Oh my!
All these ... curd cakes!
Believe me, she'll be heading for Skorphult.
What a hag!
She's locking the door.
We'll have to bring them out through a window.
But they all have inner windows.
Those cannot be opened.
How are we getting you out?
Is there a window that can be opened?
The one in the attic.
»Yes there was; the window in The Commander's own room.«
»Luckily Alfred was so big and strong, and the fattighjons so thin and light.«
Don't drop her.
She's as close as can be my fiancée.
What's what you're thinking!
You cannot make me join this foolishness.
Don't you want to join the feast?
My legs cannot go to feasts any more.
A pity, but I'll let the others bring some food to you.
God bless you for that, Emil.
We run ahead and prepare for your arrival.
You see, I become breathless.
That makes my pace so slow.
Right you are.
Imagine when The Commander is back and finds the workhouse empty!
That serves her right!
The workhouse without a living soul.
She must face that!
I haven't been to a Christmas feast for twenty years.
Well, then it's about time!
Good grief! I have never seen ...
Lo!
There is light and bliss without end.
Welcome, all of you!
Thank you.
This will be some feast!
»I want you to know«
»what was on the table in Katthult«
»that evening on Boxing Day«
»There was ...«
»one dish with blood bread,«
»one dish with cooked pork sausage, «
»one dish with brawn,«
»one dish with liver pâté,«
»one dish with smoked sausage,«
»one dish with meat-balls,«
»one dish with veal chops,«
»one dish with spare ribs,«
»one dish with barley-grain sausage,«
»one dish with potato sausage,«
»one dish with pickled herring salad,«
»one saucer with salted and cooked beef,«
»one dish with beef tongue,«
»one dish with mince-meat sausage,«
»one dish with the big Christmas ham,«
»one dish with the big Christmas cheese,«
»and loaf bread, syrup bread and light rye bread,«
»one tankard of juniper ale and one jug of milk,«
»one tureen with rice porridge,«
»one dish with curd cake,«
»one bowl with prunes,«
»one dish with apple cake,«
»one bowl with whipped cream, «
»one bowl with strawberry jam,«
»one bowl with ginger pears,«
»plus one suckling piglet, roasted whole and decorated with icing.«
»Little Ida watched them gobbling all the food.«
»She understood that only a starving person could eat like that.«
»Then she was frightened.«
»She recalled, that all their relatives from Ingatorp was coming tomorrow.«
»and this evening all the feast food would be finished.«
Emil, are you certain this isn't a mischief?
We're having guests from Ingatorp tomorrow.
They are fat enough already.
- Better all the food is eaten by those who really need it.
Yes.
What!
What's this?
Where are you?
Where are ye all?
»The Commander was more afraid than she had ever been before.«
»Who can walk through locked doors?«
»No others than the angels in Heaven.«
»There could be no other explanation, thought The Commander.«
»The poor miserable ones she had swindled of their food and snuff.«
»God's angels had brought them to a better place that the workhouse.«
»She alone was left behind in groaning and misery.«
What's this whining about?
Who was that?
What do you want?
Is that you, lying there?
Where are all the others?
I won't tell you.
Tell me, or I'll show you!
Now I've surly "tagit tabberas" on the herring salad.
Now I've surly "tagit tabberas" on the spare ribs.
»They said: "tagit tabberas".«
»That means 'tabula rasa', they've emptied the dishes and left nothing.«
»That's why this feast ever since was called
"The Big Tabberas in Katthult".«
»I can tell you that is was told about for decades afterwards,«
»in Lönneberga and in other parishes.«
Only the piglet remains.
By cracky, he looks like a little ghost.
He is not for me!
No, I've never seen such an ogre.
But Blissed-Amalia ... we've forgotten about her.
Shall we bring it to her?
Alright, let's take the piglet even if he looks like a ghost.
Is that alright, Emil?
Well ... let her have the piglet.
"A small and needy child I am,"
"yet so content and free."
"I know my Father good and dear,"
"will care for you and me."
"He loves me, warms me when I'm cold,"
"His hand will guide my way."
"His love for me is more than gold,"
»The Commander is ashamed. She dare not knock at the door and be let in.«
»She's first going to peep through the window,«
»and be assured of if her inmates are really having a party.«
»She need a box or something to step on.«
»She walks around searching ... and she did find something,«
»but not a box. She finds ...«
A sausage!
I'm well fed up already, but a sausage is a sausage.
»This is how they caught wolves in the old days in Småland.«
The banquet is over, and my days in sorrow will also come to an end.
I'm so fully fed that I can hardly walk.
Well, let's bring forth the wood sledge, Alfred.
»In a great haste they all flew down the slopes at Katthult,«
»and they all shouted for joy,«
»because it was so long since they rode a sledge.«
It certainly is fun to ride in a sledge.
»Arriving to the workhouse, they found the door open. Strange!«
»They entered and stumbled to bed, totally exhausted from food and the sledge ride,«
»but in a higher spirit than for many a year.«
»But the miserable Commander was not in a high spirit.«
»This wolf pit of Emil's was indeed deep.«
»But she had no intention to cry for help ... yet.«
»She was ashamed, and she was convinced she would be able to cope on her own.«
What's that sound?
I've caught a wolf in my wolf pit!
Mother!
That wolf has a strange howl.
Listen.
A werewolf!
»Emil was disappointed, founding out what kind of werewolf he had got.«
»Then he got an idea. Maybe he could domesticate The Commander,«
»and make her more benevolent to Stolle-Jocke and the others.«
Come and look what a shaggy beast
I've got in my pit!
Emil, is that really a werewolf?
Certainly! A mean old werewolf, and they are the most dangerous ones.
Yes, they are the greediest.
Right, that one has been a glutton all her live.
But this is the end.
Alfred, bring me my gun.
No please Emil, don't you see who I am?
»In this moment The Commander was struck by utmost fear.«
»How could she have known that Emil's gun was just a toy?«
»A wooden gun that Alfred had carved.«
Did you hear what the werewolf said, Alfred?
No ...
Neither do I care.
Bring my gun.
Don't you think this werewolf resembles The Commander?
- Yes, but The Commander is much worse.
- Oh yes.
I wonder who really took that sausage from the cupboard?
I did.
God have mercy upon me for that.
I took that sausage.
I did.
Alfred, don't you see that it really is
The Commander and not a werewolf?
Yes! Holy smoke, what a mistake we made!
Give her a hand, Alfred.
Take it!
I did take the sausage, but I had forgotten that on Christmas Eve. I swear!
A good thing she got some time to remember.
Wolf pits are not that bad after all!
»Third day of Christmas came.«
»That was the day for the Ingatorp relatives to arrive.«
»Woe! What kind of feast was this to be?«
»By all means! There was some salted pork in the larder,«
»Fried pork with rich onion sauce, that's a dish for a king!«
»But Emil's mother wrote in the blue notebook:«
»"The evening of the third day of Christmas, in despair."«
»"He's spent the whole day in the toolshed, poor child."«
»"He certainly is pious that lad,"«
»"but sometimes I think he must be stark mad."«
»In the end of March came the last blizzard that winter.«
»On the first of April the ice broke up in the Katthult stream.«
»Fourteen days later the fields lay bare.«
»At the time for the spring ploughing, more snow.«
»Then spring arrived with great haste.«
»Winter and spring were passed. Summer had come and life was the same as always.«
Wretched child!
Just you wait!
- Emil.
- Calm down, Anton
Calm down! I'm calming down the best I can!
Where's my wooden shoe?
I am calm!
»However, at some occasions Emil was content being a nice boy smacking flies.«
"They were to meet in this flower dell,"
"and now she rests at the cooling well."
"She felt alone and begun to walk,"
"Alas no Alfred with loving talk."
There was a fly walking on your behind.
"By agony her mind was stirred,"
"when a shot from the wood she heard."
"She almost fainted, Alfred she found,"
"so bleeding deadly upon the ground."
Good grief, what gloomy songs you sing!
Lina, give me a hand, will you.
Alfred, have you talked to her?
- Talked about what?
- That you don't want to marry her.
No, I haven't
Why don't you tell her?
Well ... that must be done courteously.
It's a delicate matter.
I don't want to make her sad.
But you have to tell her soon.
Well yes, I will.
Only I could find out a polite way!
"The maiden said now is fall, lovingly will none me call."
"Disappear like a dream, life's an empty stream."
"Nothing gives me joy, until I meet my boy."
"World, oh you are so amiss, with no love no bliss."
"In my grave tears I'll cry, with no love I'd rather die."
"Nothing more I beg thee, truelove come to me."
So, there you are, Lina.
Well Lina, since long I have wanted to tell you something.
What could that be, sweet Alfred?
What will you tell me?
That marriage we've spoken of for years,
Well, marriage is just bullshit.
Let's blow that of.
»Well, those were his exact words, poor Alfred.«
»I shouldn't have told you.«
»I don't want to teach you more swear words than you already know.«
»But have in mind that Alfred was a poor farm hand in Lönneberga, whilst you're not.«
»He was unable to find a more polite way to tell Lina, poor man.«
»By the way,
Lina wasn't at all depressed.«
»Bullshit! That's what you think.
Just you wait and see!«
»In that moment Alfred knew that he would never get away from Lina.«
»This very evening he wanted to feel free and happy.«
»So he and Emil went down to Katthult Lake, to catch perch.«
»The evening was as beautiful, as it can almost only be in Småland«
»The blackbirds were singing, and the mosquitoes were buzzing.«
»They were sitting on a rock, hardly saying anything,«
»still they enjoyed each others company.«
Do you know what I'm going to do tomorrow, Alfred?
No.
Some kind of mischief?
Well ...
I don't know.
I never know until afterwards.
"Good grief, he was an impish boy,"
"he second was to none."
"and Emil was the name he had, yes, Emil was his name."

Huck, oh, ho, Huckleberry
Huck, say, hey
Say, Huckleberry, Huck
Oh, oh, Huckleberry
Say, Huckleberry Finn
Say, Huckleberry, Huckleberry Finn
To the possum, you're the next of kin
Hey, Huckleberry, Huckleberry Finn
Boss is gonna getcha, gonna fetcha home
Hey, Huck
Gonna bet you're somewheres off alone
You all seen Huckleberry?
No, Jim.
Hey, Huckleberry, Huckleberry Finn
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Marybelle, have you seen Huckleberry?
No, not around here, I haven't.
All right. Thank you.
Sun's a-settin' in the same old place
Moon's about to climb the sky
You're a-wastin' all my time a-chasin'
'Cause your supper is about to fry
Mr. Tomkins... has Huck Finn been in here today?
No, he hasn't, Jim.
Well, I best go on down to the river, then.
Ho, ho, Huckleberry
Huck, ho, ho, Huckleberry
Huck, say, hey
Hey, Huckleberry, Huck, ho, ho
Huckleberry, hey, Huckleberry, hey
Folks are cozyin' to home 'bout now
But you're out mozyin'
So I've been chozyin'
To fetch you back to home with me
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Jim!
Oh, I knew it wasn't no catfish.
Tug was more like a whale.
You got to get home quick.
The ladies are waiting supper on you, and I know you don't want no more punishment, now do you, Huckleberry?
- Heck, no.
- All right, then. Let's go.
And Mr. Dobbins said all you have to do is learn to apply yourself better.
He said you had good natural intelligence and you learn very fast.
He could be the head of the class if he'd only try.
I'd like to see him the head of the Sunday school class.
In fact, I'd just like to see him
in his Sunday school class.
Just what was your lesson for next Sunday?
Mmm... Moses a-a-and the bull rushers.
Huckleberry, dear, my sister and I are only concerned about your future.
Judge Thatcher put that buried treasure money that you found into a trust.
When you come of age, you're going to be a young gentlemen of considerable means.
You don't have to end up like your father... a derelict with his body floating down the river.
Sometimes I get the feelin' that Pap ain't dead.
And that body they found floatin' was floatin' face up.
And everybody knows that a dead man floats face down.
Leastwise, that's the feelin' I get.
Better get upstairs and do your studying now, Huckleberry.
Yes, ma'am.
And it wouldn't hurt to take another look at that chapter on Moses and the bull rushers.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm getting more concerned about that boy every day.
Oh, sister.
You worry too much.
You think you're a good deal of a big bug, don't ya?
Pap! You ain't dead!
You've put on considerable many frills since I've been away.
You can read and write.
Who told you you might meddle with such high-falutin' foolishness, huh?
- The widder.
- The widder, eh?!
Who told the widder she could put in her shovel of a thing that ain't none of her business?
Nobody, Pap.
I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father.
Let on to be better than what he is!
They say you're rich, eh?
How's that?
Well, I found some money, Pap.
They put it in a trust till...
Liar!
Mr. Finn!
What are you doing?!
What do you want?
What I'm doin' is learnin' my son not to lie.
And what I want is what's rightfully mine.
The money he's lyin' about.
Come on!
Huckleberry has no money!
None he can put his hands on...
All I know is I want $1,000!
Now, if you ever wanna see this kid again, you have it for me in two days.
- Come on!
- We're poor women.
Where would we get that much money?
You're a poor woman, ain't ya?
With a big, healthy slave down there who'll fetch a fine piece of money from the slave traders.
Come on!
Please, Mr. Finn!
Mr. Finn, please let me talk to you.
Mr. Finn, please!
Please!
Don't take him away from me!
Mr. Finn!
Two days!
You have the money here.
I'll be back.
- Honey.
- Jim.
I gotta go. I gotta go now.
I gotta get away from here.
Got to go?
What did you do, Jim?
I ain't done nothin', but they're gonna sell me to the slave traders.
- Not Miss Watson.
- She can't help it.
Huck's pap done came and took him away.
And the ladies... they need the money to buy Huck back.
Jim, you know what they do to runaway slaves.
They catch you, they whip you, they truss you up like a hog!
But if they sell me... then I may as well be dead.
'Cause I won't never see you no more.
But where will you go?
Where will you hide?
I'll try to make it to the free states.
To... well, to Cairo, Illinois.
That's... that's the closest place.
Cairo? Why, that must be a thousand miles from here.
Someday there ain't gonna be no more good-byes.
Someday, honey, darlin'
Won't be tears in your eyes
And someday we'll be standing
With our heads held up high
Smilin' and a-laughin'
Just for no reason why
I see it plain that somehow
I don't know now
But I know we'll be fine
Trust me, oh, honey, trust me
'Cause I've seen me a sign
That someday, honey, darlin'
Don't know how long it'd be
Honey, darlin'
Honey, darlin'
You must remember this
Though I'm goin' far away
It's gonna be all sunshine
And singin'
Someday
I can't explain, but somehow
I don't know now
But I know we'll be fine
You, me, and the baby
Oh, I've seen me that sign
That someday, honey, darlin'
Don't know how long it'd be
Honey, darlin'
Honey, darlin'
You belong just to me
Pap! Pap! Wake up!
Pap, you was havin' another one of your fits.
It ain't fair.
You sleep sound while I've got the demons chasing me.
Likes I won't get no sleep till I'm dead.
Get yourself down to the lines, see if we got any breakfast.
What's takin' you so long?!
Hurry up!
- We get any fish?
- Yeah, Pa!
I fell in, Pap.
It ain't so bad, us bein' together again.
Is it, Pap?
Just don't get too comfortable about it.
As soon as I get that money,
I don't care if you go straight to hell.
You've been bad luck for me since the day you was born!
You killed your mother gettin' born... you know that!
I'm goin' across to Hannibal now.
And your two sweet old ladies better have my $1,000.
My son comes into money
I'll tell ya what I see
Two gospel-spoutin' biddies is stealin' it from me
I never got a tumble,
I never got a break
But now my luck's a-changin'
I'll get all I can take
Rotten luck
Filthy rotten luck
The only kind of luck
I ever had
Rotten luck
Stinkin' rotten luck
But now, at last, my luck
Ha! It ain't so bad!
They're all liars!
Runaway slave.
Like hell he run away.
Murder!
Murder!
He's been murdered!
Huck, can you... can you hear me?
Here, sit up.
Take it easy now.
There you are.
You rest easy, right there.
Take it easy.
Here. Drink this.
Oh, I gave you up for dead almost two days ago.
- What happened, Jim?
- Snake bite.
The only thing to do is to cut an X, suck out the poison and pray.
What's this?
That's... that's a hex.
I ain't stuperstitious or nothin', but, uh...
Well, with a friend's life, you don't wanna take too many chances.
Gosh, Jim.
Thanks for savin' my life.
Don't thank me.
You best thank that hex.
They been comin' past this island every day shootin' off them cannons tryin' to raise your body.
I heard 'em talkin' from the boats.
You supposed to be murdered.
Well, I just had to get away from Pap.
So I broke out and I killed me this wild pig.
Then I bloodied up the place real smart.
Well, they tell me it's real bad luck makin' out like you're dead.
How'd you come to get here, Jim?
- I ran away, Huck.
- You ran away?
And now you know, and now they your troubles, too.
So, I figure, I die showin' nothin' they sell me down to New Orleans to them slave traders.
So I come here, and I'm just about finished buildin' me this raft with a wigwam on it and a nice, dry sand on the floor.
Well, anywheres you land they's gonna pick you up for runaway.
Don't you know that?
Not if I make it to the free states, they ain't.
Free states?!
That's pretty far.
Cairo, Illinois.
We gonna cha-dugga-dugga on down the river to the free states!

Jim! Look!
Hey, looks like a wrecked houseboat.
Looks like she hasn't been a-ground too long.
You know, Huck, we just may be in luck.
You tie her off here and I'll see what we can find.
Oh, we gonna feast fancy tonight!
Pap.
You find anything?
Nothin'. There ain't nothin' in there but... a dead man.
It ain't nothin' but a house of death.
Let's get outta here.
Goshen should be over there.
Huck, we're lost.
Well, let's head for that cove over there.
I'll find out where we are.
- Who is it?
- Just me, ma'am.
Well, who's "just me"?
Sarah Williams, ma'am.
Well, whereabouts you live?
In this neighborhood?
In Bookerville.
I've walked all the way, and I'm all tired out.
Hungry, too, I reckon.
I'll fetch you somethin' to eat.
Come in and take a chair.
Thank you, ma'am.
But I ain't hungry.
You see, my mother's down sick and out of money and everything.
And, well,
I come to visit my uncle.
And, well, I never been here in Goshen before.
Goshen? This ain't Goshen, child.
This is St. Petersburg.
St. Petersburg?
Goshen's 30 miles up the river.
- Who told you this was Goshen?
- Why, a man I met this morning.
Well, he was drunk,
I reckon.
And you, poor thing, walkin' around with a murderin' runaway slave hidin' out in these parts.
A murderin' slave?
Killed a lad named Huck Finn.
Near Hannibal.
It's an $800 reward on his head.
What did you say your name was, honey?
Mary Williams.
I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in.
Yes, ma'am, I did.
It's Sarah Mary Williams.
Oh, that's the way it is, is it?
Yes, ma'am.
Maybe you'll find a bigger needle in there.
What's your real name?
Is it Tom? Dick? Bob?
What is it?
Please don't poke fun at a poor girl like me. If I'm in your way...
Just sit right down there.
You're a runaway 'prentice, ain't you?
Well, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am.
I won't tell on you.
Don't worry.
Now tell me all about it.
My mother and father's dead.
And the law... well, they bound me out to this mean old farmer in the country, and so I stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out.
When a cow's laying down, which side of it gets up first?
Hind end, ma'am.
- Well, then a horse?
- Forward end, ma'am.
If 15 cows is browsin' on a hillside, how many eat facin' in the same direction?
Well, the whole 15, ma'am.
Well, I reckon you have lived in the country.
I thought you was tryin' to hocus me again.
No, ma'am.
Tell me, what's your real name?
George Peters, ma'am.
- Well, try to remember it, George.
- Yes, ma'am.
You do a girl tolerable poor.
Trot along to your uncle,
Sarah-Mary-Williams-George-Peters.
You'll fetch Goshen by goin' through town and followin' the river up.
Yes, ma'am. Thank ya.
Mind you, boy.
Go through town.
Whatever you do, don't cut through that plantation.
No, ma'am.
Good night, ma'am.
Be done, boys! Hush!
- Who be ya?
- George Jackson, sir.
Stand up, boy.
Whatcha doin' prowlin' round here this time of the night for?
I'm lost. Fell overboard off the steamboat.
Jace. Now, look here. You're tellin' the truth, you needn't be afraid.
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.
- Clothes are dry, Pa.
How come your clothes are dry, George Jackson?
Well, I fell off this afternoon.
George Jackson... are you kin to the Shepherdsons?
No, sir.
You know the Shepherdsons?
No, sir.
I never heard of 'em.
Mr. Jackson,
I'm Colonel Saul Grangerford.
And these are my sons.
It would be my distinct pleasure to have you as our guest here at Grangerford.
Gimme your arm, boy!
Come in.
Mr. Jackson, sir, my name is Buck.
And whiles you're here at Grangerford Manor,
I will be your personal manservant and valet.
Well, would you mind fetchin' me out of this here contraption?
See, I usually does my body-washin' in the river.
Here at Grangerford Manor, there are only gentlefolks.
And they do all their body-washing inside the house.
What's this?
This is your nightcap, sir.
All gentlefolks wear this.
- 'Night, Mr. Jackson.
- Good night.
Jim!
- Good morning, family.
- Good morning, Papa.
- Sleep well, Mr. Jackson?
- Oh, yes. Thank you, sir.
But... if it's all right with you,
I'd like to leave after breakfast.
Don't worry, boy.
We won't let you outstay your welcome.
Mr. Jackson, you look like a bright young man.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Jackson, where was Moses when the candle went out?
Well, I don't know.
I never heard of it before.
Was he in the bull rushers?
Well, guess.
How can I guess if I never heard of it before?
Well, you can guess, can't ya?
It's just as easy.
- Which candle?
- Any candle.
I don't know where he was.
Where was he?
Why, he was in the dark... that's where he was!
- Miss Charlotte.
- Thank you, Mitzi.
I have just composed my finest poem.
It's all about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Botts that fell down a well and was drownded.
Drownded?
Would you like me to read my poem?
I'd be mighty obliged,
Miss Emmeline.
"Ode to Stephen Dowling Botts, deceased."
"And did young Stephen sicken?
"And did young Stephen die?
"And did the sad hearts thicken?
"And did the mourners cry?
"No, such was not the fate of young Stephen Dowling Botts.
"His soul did from this cold world fly by fallin' down a well."
Mighty inspirational, Miss Emmeline.
Mighty inspirational.
I'm so worried about Charlotte.
So worried.
Don't fuss, Rachel, honey.
Don't fuss.
Clive, I must apologize for Charlotte.
I came all the way from New Hope.
I know.
And I'm most sorry.
Just a few friends and relations, Mr. Jackson.
- Handsome tradition, don't you think?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Drink up, Mr. Jackson.
Good Grangerford punch.
Saul, you don't seem to understand.
I haven't seen hide nor hair of our Charlotte since early afternoon.
And she knows Cousin Clive has come all the way from New Hope to see her.
I sent Jason into town to find her.
Don't fret, Rachel, honey.
She'll be along.
My daughters prepared a little entertainment for you.
So, you all gather around.
I found a rose in a Bible
Who knows the story it told
Pressed there with joy or with a tear
It was just a forgotten souvenir
Is our love a rose in a Bible?
A bud that will lose its perfume
Please tell me no
Say that our love will grow
Like a flower
Forever in bloom
Now, would all you gentlemen and ladies join us?
I found a rose in a Bible
Who knows the story it told
Pressed there with joy
- Mr. Jackson, sir.
- Thank you.
Aren't you going to ask me for a dance, Mr. Jackson?
Ma'am, I don't rightly know.
Is our love a rose in a Bible?
A bud that will lose its perfume
Please tell me no
Say that our love will grow
Like a flower
Forever in...
Pa! She's run off!
Charlotte! She's run off!
My own sister!
She's run off and eloped with Harvey Shepherdson.
Horses!
Weapons!
We're gonna kill us some Shepherdsons tonight.
Ain't no need for horses, Pa.
The Shepherdsons have surrounded the place now.
Bring out the guns.
All women and children into the wine cellar.
Buck! He's my gun bearer and my loader.
Mr. Jackson,
I think you're man enough to watch me kill some of those Shepherdsons.
I think you're gonna enjoy it!
Thank you, Buck.
Stay with me.
Snuff out the lights.
Polluters!
Defilers of our Shepherdson blood.
Tonight we spill Grangerford blood!
It's a matter of honor!
Bull's eye.
Feud is a funny thing,
Mr. Jackson.
Man has a quarrel with another man, and he kills him.
And that other man's brother... he kills him.
And the other brothers on both sides...
...they go for one another.
Then the cousins chip in.
If you'd be so kind as to rip down that drape and stomp out the fire,
I'd be ever so grateful to ya,
Mr. Jackson.
Buck!
Gimme my pistol.
Williams!
Bring me some punch.
Take your coat off, Mr. Jackson.
You're in action now!
Thank you, Buck.
How long's this feud been going on, Colonel?
Oh, 60 years or somewhere about that.
What was the trouble about?
I don't rightly know.
It was about some land or something.
Who done the shooting?
Was it Grangerford or was it Shepherdson?
That, Mr. Jackson, is entirely beside the point.
It has now become a matter of honor.
Come with me, Mr. Jackson.
Come with me.
Come on, Mr. Jackson.
Now's your chance.
River's down there.
If I was you, Mr. Jackson,
I'd get myself far away from these here gentlefolks.
Thank you, Buck.
I'm much obliged to ya.
Mr. Jackson, sir!
Mr. Jackson, sir!
Oh, Mr. Jackson.
I was only playin' possum!
- Good-bye, Buck.
- Good-bye.
Is that you?
Hey, I've never been happier to see somebody in my whole life!
Thank God you're all right. I heard them shots last night, I thought they killed you.
- What did they do to you?
- Let's not lose any time.
Let's just shove off for the big water as fast as we can.
All right.
That must've been Goshen back there.
We come 30 miles, Jim.
Yep.
You know... there ain't no home like a raft.
Other places seem so cramped up and smothery.
But a raft doesn't.
You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.
There's only one thing botherin' me.
And that's folks thinkin' that I murdered you.
My bein' called a runaway... that don't bother me at all.
But I don't wanna be called no murderer.
Well, you know I can't show my face back to Hannibal and tell folks
I haven't been murdered.
They'd send me back to Pap for sure.
The way I see it, we just gotta stick together now.
I'm your only evidence.
- Turn in this here cove!
- Yes, sir!
I can't wait till we get to Cairo.
I'm gonna catch me one of them big boats... and gonna ship out as a cabin boy to South America.
And then I'm gonna start my own coffee plantation.
There's lots of money in coffee beans.
But me...
I'm gonna stay in dry goods.
- What's the matter, Jim?
- Slave hunters!
- Who's that yonder?
- It's just a raft, sir.
- Any men on it?
- Just one and me.
Hush up, Jim.
Well, there's five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of the bend.
Your man white or black?
He's white, sir.
I reckon we'll see for ourselves.
Catch this here line.
Pap and me is much obliged to ya.
I can tell ya, everybody scoots off when I want 'em to tow this blamed raft ashore.
Well, that's infernal mean.
Odd, too.
Say, boy, what's the matter with your father?
Well... it ain't anything much.
Boy, you're hidin' somethin'.
What is the matter with your pap?
Well...
Please, if you'll just tow us to shore.
You won't have to get near the raft.
Your pap's got the smallpox!
And you know it precious well!
Drop that line, boy!
Confound it!
I just bet the wind's done blowed it to us!
Why didn't you come out and say so?!
You wanna spread it all over?!
Well, everybody else I told run off and left us.
Poor devil.
We're downright sorry for ya.
But, well, hang it! We don't wanna get the smallpox, don't ya see?
Let's get outta here.
Goodbye, boy!
Good luck.
You see any runaway niggers, you get help and nab 'em!
You can make some good money by it.
Thank you, sir! I won't let any runaway get by me if I can help it.
I ain't no damn abolutionist.
Huck... Huck, here I am.
- Are they outta sight yet?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna roast in hell forever for all the lies I told for you.
You didn't have to get in the water.
Well, I didn't wanna take no chances.
You sure had them scared.
Well...
We best spend the night on the shore.
Come on.
Get them off this boat. We'll have none of that kind of thing around here.
Get them off the boat right now.
- Take your hands off me!
- Get off my ship. Stay off.
We'll have none of that... none of that riff-raff.
Take the scalawags off.
- You'll hear from my law...
- Card sharks! River hustlers!
First you fleece my passengers, but that ain't enough.
Then you start takin' my whole crew!
Do you know, sir, to whom you are speaking?!
Tell him, Bilgewater!
I'll have you know, sir, that we are men of title.
The blood of kings flows through our veins.
Your rash, unfounded accusations can only be looked upon with contempt, sir!
Throw out their luggage!
Bring it out!
Throw it overboard.
You go find my hatbox.
Hurry, you lackeys!
Well, throw it, you idiot!
That should be done with them.
Raise it up.
I hope that an undeserved fate will haunt you forever, sir!
You are obviously not fit...
I told you we shouldn't have pulled the
Cincinnati double shuffle on the first night.
It wasn't our performance, dear boy.
It was their pitiful lack of imagination.
Well, what are we gonna do next?
It's not "what are we gonna do," it is "whom are we going to do."
Now, don't look now, but the next recipients of our estimable companionship are, at this very moment, coming to our rescue.
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
Oh, alas! Oh, woe.
Well, cry, you idiot.
Well, why are you gawking?
Mocking us in our hour of degradation.
Be gone with you!
Be gone, I say.
Do you need any help?
Help?
What help can you give us when fate has fetched us so low, when we were once so high?
Let the cruel world do its worst, but there's one thing we know.
There's a grave somewhere for us.
The world will always go on as it always has, and take everything from us.
Money, property, loved ones... everything!
But they can't take that.
One day we'll lay our poor, broken hearts down in that grave.
The rest... is silence.
Well, what are you heaving your poor, broken hearts at us for?
We're not blaming you.
It's the world that's brought us down.
Where was you brought down from?
Oh, you wouldn't believe us.
The world never believes the secrets of our birth.
'Tis no matter.
Let it pass.
Let it pass.
The secrets of your birth?
Wait a minute.
You have a sympathetic-looking face.
Perhaps you would believe us.
My great-grandmater on my pater's side
Became a baroness
Then great-grandpater died
When later great-grandmater again became a bride
She wed a duke, so the royal strain was doubled when she wed again their son
My grand-pere became the rightful heir
But lost his lofty title in a dubious game of chemin de fer
What a sad demise for the true Dolphine
My Daddy was Louie XVll
Thus I, but for a tragic happenstance
Am His Majesty, the King of France
The King of France?
You're looking at royalty
Royalty
Fouled and foiled, slightly soiled, but
Royalty
Born to reign
All in vain
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Tell him about yourself,
Bilgey.
- Well, l...
- Never mind.
The Duke of Bilgewater
A hundred years gone by
Braved the broad Atlantic to give the colonies a try
My grandfather's life was hard and brief
My mother sold matches and died of grief
Thus here, but for a cruel, historic fluke
Is Lord Bilgewater
A full-fledged Duke
You're looking at...
Royalty
Royalty
Fouled and foiled
Slightly soiled
But royalty
Born to reign
All in vain
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Well, can't we at least fetch you down to the next town?
No, no. We couldn't think of encroaching on your hospitality.
But since you insist, have your manservant tote our belongings aboard, and let's get outta here.
Come on, Jim.
What should I call you?
Your Grace, My Lord, or Your Lordship?
Well, we're traveling incognito, you understand.
You simply call me King.
Call him Bilgewater.
You may put that there, my good man.
You're looking at royalty
Royalty
Lost our throne, two rolling stones
But royalty
Unlike you, our blood is blue
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Shove off. Shove off.
You're lookin' at royalty
You're lookin' at royalty
Fouled and foiled, slightly soiled, but
Royalty
Worn and torn
But
To the manor born
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Lower your eyes and bend your knees
You jack-a-napes are gapin' at royalty
I was up all night.
Think I'll take a few winks of sleep.
Tell me, Jim.
You're a runaway slave, aren't ya?
Who? Me?
No, sir.
I ain't no runaway.
I mean you no harm, Jim.
Just seems mighty strange for a young boy and a healthy black like yourself to be shiftin' free and easy here on this raft headin' downriver.
Straight for Cairo... which, as any simple-minded fool knows, is exactly where a runaway slave would just naturally gravitate.
Well, uh...
He ain't no runaway.
You see, King, my folks was livin' in Pike County, Missouri.
It's where I was born.
And they all died off except for me and Pap and my brother lke and our freeborn manservant here, Jim.
That's right.
He's tellin' it right.
Oh, I know he is.
And he's doing a wonderful job.
- Isn't he, though.
- Yeah.
Continue... what'd you say your name was?
Jackson.
George Jackson.
Well, we ran into a piece of bad luck a couple of nights ago.
A steamboat ran over the forward end of our raft.
We all fell overboard underneath the wheel.
Jim and me come up all right, but, well,
Pap was drunk, and, well, lke was only four years old.
Lord rest their souls.
That was a really, very touching story, but... l've had a trying morning.
Think I'm gonna join my friend in the arms of Morpheus.
Move your feet, Bilgey.
Move your feet.
What?!
I've had better accommodations than this.
You think he believed us?
But did you believe him?
I mean, about them being royalty and all?
Well, not all of it.
Well, as long as he believes we believe that stretcher he told us,
I figure he'll go along with ours.
Besides, like Miss Watson used to say, them two just may be a blessing in disguise.
And once he gets you into his clutches, my friends, the demon rum will rot ya through and through.
Rot your body, rot your brain, rot your immortal soul.
Ooh, it was spellbinding, I tell ya.
I was the pet of the womenfolk... big and little.
'Cause we was makin' it mighty warm for those rummies.
We were takin' in a fortune.
Then somehow or other a little report got out that we was puttin' in time with the jug on the sly.
- They run us out...
- Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
Then we... then we took to sellin' an article to take the tartar off the teeth.
And it does, too.
And generally the enamel along with it.
We... we got out of there just ahead of the lynch mob.
Enough, Bilgey.
They were a pack of ingrates.
Boy, put mine over there.
May I make a suggestion, gentlemen?
If I was to make believe to be your slave, why, folks would never question two gentlemen of obvious qualities such as yourselves.
Why, you'd appear to be the owners of a valuable piece of property... namely, me.
And that way, we could all travel together safely.
Brilliant.
Brilliant!
But... but it needs something.
Let me think.
I've got it!
You two wanna make it safely to Cairo, right?
Yes, sir.
It wouldn't hurt to have a little jingle in your pockets when you get there, would it?
You are now members of the
Royal Shakespeare Touring Company.
Good thinkin', King.
Bilgey, I want you to make me up some new posters and tickets... lots of tickets.
"For two nights only,
David Garrick the younger,
"and Edmund Keene the elder.
"Direct from London in their celebrated performance of The Royal Nonesuch."
The play's the thing, boys.
Our dear citizens of this fair, charming, quaint city of Clairville...
Trusting you all know your own names...
...let me tell you mine.
I am David Garrick the younger of the Royal Haymarket Theatre,
White Chapel, Piccadilly,
Pudding Lane... London!
Now star and managing director of the Royal Shakespeare Touring Company.
And now, let me introduce you to the members of my illustrious troupe.
First of all,
Mr. Edmund Keene the elder of the Drury Lane Theatre, London, right there.
Yes. And now, my young ward
Percival Hepplewhite, III, known throughout Europe as the boy genius of Stratford-Upon-Avon right there.
Thank you for your passionate response, sir.
And now, last but not least, perhaps the world's most brilliant interpreter of Shakespeare's immortal character Caliban, the former king of Huggamugga,
King Goonawonga right there.
Assisted by the strength of my entire troupe, with new appointments, new scenery, new props, for just two nights only because of imperative European engagements...
...we will... we will present the thrilling, spine-tingling, inspiring epic from the pen of the Bard himself...
The Royal Nonesuch.
Unfortunately, however, there...
Unfortunately, however, women and children will not be admitted to either performance.
Under any circumstances.
There must be at least a hundred people in there.
More like 163, including standing room.
- Can hardly wait to see the show myself.
- Me, neither.
Full house. Let's go.
You two run along down to the raft with Bilgewater.
Don't we get to see the show?
His Majesty don't like nobody watching from the wings. Come on. Get out.
Why, Tom, you're too young.
Who let you in?
I let myself in.
- Well, let yourself out.
- Hey! Put me down!
Bless you.
Gentlemen and gentlemen...
The Royal Shakespeare Touring
Company is proud to present tonight, for your pleasure...
...the least known, yet far greatest work of the Bard of Avon.
"The Royal Nonesuch."
Also known as "The Tragedy of the...
- of the King's Camel Leopard."
Prepare for rolling heads
Blood that sheds
Right before your eyes
Revenge and hate
The knell of fate
When everybody dies
And, ooh, there's so much more
There's lust and gore
Laughter
Tears
And sin
The Royal Nonesuch has come to town
So let the play be...
Before we raise the curtain on this epic tour de force
Certain pertinent facts
I must convey
This manuscript lay static
In a corner of Shakespeare's attic
Till I by chance discovered it
Dramatically uncovered it
It was a cold and rainy night.
I happened to be a house guest at the ancestral cottage of my dear friend Shakespeare.
Alas, sleep would not come, so I spent the night scuffling about amidst the boxes and the barrels in the loft, when...
Moment of moments...
I stumbled upon this discarded bundle of parchment.
Breathlessly I blew away
247 years of dust.
And lo... there it was.
In the Bard's own hand.
The Royal Nonesuch, a new tragedy by William Shakespeare!
Oh, ho, there's so much more
Than love and war in this great Shakes-perience
The Royal Nonesuch has come to town
The Royal Nonesuch of much renown
The Royal Nonesuch won't let you down
So let
The play
Commence
Come on, come on.
Can't we at least go back and take a look? He'd never know.
That was a triumph.
Let's get out of here.
- Is the show over already?
- Always leave them wanting more.
Get that boy outta here.
What the devil you doin', boy?
We threw you out once.
Belay there.
Let the boy speak.
I just come to tell you there'll be no show tonight.
They all run off.
I saw 'em.
The kid's right!
They're gone!
There ain't nothin' back there.
No scenery, no costumes... nothin' but the piano player.
I sure don't like this Royal Nonesuch business.
Stealin' poor people's money... that's... that's downright dishonest.
Well, you're stealin' yourself from Miss Watson, ain't ya?
Now, stealin' is stealin', Jim.
Well, there is stealin' and there is stealin'.
But this here... is stealin'.
But the King was right about one thing.
Nobody's lookin' at ya like you're a runaway slave no more, now are they?
And, besides, we're only a couple of days from Cairo.
Cairo.
- Why, that's...
- Money in the bank.
Here. You hammer up the rest of the posters.
I'm gonna do a little advance promotin'.
God rest ye merry gentlemen.
Good tidings to you all.
One and all, good tidings.
Hip, hip, hip, hip, and all that rot.
Whiskey. Your best.
You must be the Reverend Wilks all the way from England.
My condolences.
From England, rather, but Reverend Wilks...
Condolences?
Condolences for what?
Your brother just died.
That is, if you was the Reverend
Mr. Wilks, your brother just died... leaving all that money.
Money?
Come here! Forget the signs, forget the posters.
What?
Gentlemen, we are about to raise the curtain on the most lucrative engagement of our careers.
You might even say we were born for these roles.
But we are not gonna perform here in Barrytown.
The stage awaits a few miles downriver in Jackson's Landing. Come on!
Now remember, Bilgey, you're deaf and dumb.
Yes, yes, King.
Fine. And you?
Rather, I say.
Very good. And that's all you say, so remember it.
Huckleberry, I have a bad feeling about it.
This time, they've gone too far.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
If anybody comes nosin' around here, just get in there and moan and groan.
Let me hear you.
Jim, this is the last of it.
Soon as I shuck these two,
I'm gonna cut right back to here, and we'll be in Cairo tomorrow.
All right, Hucky.
I'll be waitin' for you.
Now, you be careful, you hear?
I won't be long, Jim.
I promise.
Percival, let's get going.
Goodbye, Jim.
Come along, dear boy.
Quick, let's get going.
Jackson's Landing is just around the point.
You row, Bilgey.
Farewell, fellow voyagers.
Parting is such sweet sorrow, but I know that the good Lord, in His kindness, will guide your ship up the river of life.
Bless you, bless you, bless you, ble...
Bless you, bless you.
Bless you.
Bless you.
My poor, afflicted brother here is expressing our profound gratitude for our safe arrival in this haven of the New World after our tedious pilgrimage all the way from England.
Sheffield, England. Amen.
Bless you.
How do you do?
How do you do? Hello.
Hello. Nice day.
Bless you. Bless you.
Can any of you kind people tell us where Mr. Peter Wilks lives?
I'm sorry, sir.
The best we can do is tell you where he used to live as of yesterday mornin'.
You mean... our poor brother... is gone?
If only we had a chance to see him.
It's too much to bear!
- Reverend Wilks?
- Yes. Alas, it is I.
My name is Lot Hovey.
Deacon Lot Hovey.
How often has Peter written of you and your dear wife...
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Of course. Dear Margaret.
And what of my nieces?
Poor darlings. What of them?
I'd be honored to take you to them.
Lead on, Deacon.
Lead on.
Your uncles are here!
Mary Jane, Susan... we are here.
Poor child.
There, there, there. Uncle's here.
Don't cry.
Yes, come to Uncle, dear.
That's it.
Oh, that's it.
Yes, Uncle's here.
Don't cry.
Come, come, honey. Don't cry.
Yes, well, Brother William was just singing a fitting hymn for this solemn...
Oh, Reverend Wilks, could we hear it?
- Yes, out of respect.
- We wanna sing along.
- Please.
- Please.
Well... well, all right.
All right... gentle souls.
Into His hands,
Into His hands
Some day we must come
Some day we must come
Into His wonderful, wonderful hands,
Into His heavenly, heavenly hands
Into His wonderful, heavenly hands
Some day we must come
Some day we must come
Into His hands
Into His hands
Into His hands
Some day we must come
Into His wonderful, wonderful hands
Into His heavenly, heavenly hands
Into His wonderful, heavenly hands
Into His heavenly, heavenly hands
Into His hands,
Into His hands
Into His wonderful, heavenly hands
Some day we must come
Some day we must come
Some day
We must
Come
Amen
So, when we received your dear father's letter, we departed our parish haste post haste, taking our young ward
Percival here with us.
He's been such an aid and comfort to us on our journey.
Poor dear. The only time I get to hear him is when he's eating.
But our main concern is for you, dear children.
- Left all alone...
- Oh! Uncle Harvey?
We almost forgot.
There's a letter.
Father's last wishes.
He wanted us to give it to you immediately upon your arrival, but with...
Completely understandable, my dear.
Go fetch the letter.
Your dear father's last wishes must be carried out forthwith down here.
Because he would not be happy up there knowing that things weren't going right down here.
You're very considerate,
Uncle Harvey.
My calling.
Besides, your dear uncles want to unburden you of all concerns.
God rest his generous soul.
I'm explaining to Brother William that your dear father has willed this house and its furnishings plus $3,000 in gold to you, his dear daughters.
And he has willed the tannery, worth $7,000 and another $3,000 in gold to poor, afflicted William and me.
The gold is hidden in two sacks under some bricks in the cellar.
William... has just expressed a sentiment with which I heartily concur.
We cannot accept one shilling of your dear father's beneficence.
- It's for you.
- No, it's all for you.
No, no, no, no.
It's all yours, dear nieces.
But we will go down to the cellar and fetch it to protect it for you.
So that he may rest cold but joyful.
Those dear, good souls.
Rather.
Be careful. Ow!
Careful, you idiot!
You look over there.
I'll look down here.
Ow!
- These here bricks are loose.
- Get 'em.
Golly dang.
This sure beats... this sure beats
"Royal Nonesuch" all howdy, don't it?
Be aware that it's only the first act.
We're gotta play this one out till the final curtain.
This house alone will bring 10,000, not countin' furnishings... and the tannery.
- Yeah.
- And this $6,000.
Where's the other one?
Here, move this.
There it is.
By the time this play is over, you and I will be gentlemen of leisure.
It's providence, Bilgey.
Providence.
Being relatives to rich dead men and representatives of foreign heirs.
There's the line for us.
No more small time bilkin' hayseeds.
We've found our calling.
By this time tomorrow, we will be rich.
Far away from here.
Who is it?
It's Mary Jane, Percy.
Oh. Come in.
I thought you might need this come morning.
It gets awfully cold.
Rather.
You know, Percy, there's something about you that seems mighty strange.
But there is something about you I like.
Guess I've always wanted a little brother to fuss over.
I'm very happy to have you here, Percy.
I do hope we can all stay together for a long, long time.
Good night, Percy.
Good night, Mary Jane.
Bless you.
Mary Jane.
Susan.
How could I ever hurt them?
Jim's waitin' down on the river.
Gotta get back to him.
What's right? What's wrong?
Try to fight or go along?
How can you win
When every day you make the Devil grin?
Which way is real?
What you're taught or what you feel?
What's false?
What's fine?
And who's decidin' the dividin' line?
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna die and burn
But with the Devil always doggin' at my heels
How the devil am I gonna learn?
What's right? What's wrong?
Try to fight or go along?
How can you tell
The road to heaven from the one to hell?
Some folks live wise
Other folks are livin' lies
Can't find my way
But I'll keep tryin'
Till my dyin' day
We've been robbed!
Vandalized! Pillaged! Plundered!
We've been robbed!
We've been robbed!
Vandalized! Pillaged! Plundered!
Give me a hand, Bilgey.
Plundered!
We've been robbed! We've been robbed!
You've been robbed!
You've been robbed!
What happened?
That river rat... that little swindler.
He took the gold.
The sheriff.
We have got to tell the sheriff.
But I just can't believe it...
Well, you'd better believe it, my dear.
That scalawag has shifty eyes.
Come on, Bil... uh, Brother William.
We have to go roust the sheriff and rescue our nieces' gold.
Also, we have to arrange post haste for the auction.
We should've got out of town last night, like I said.
Now we got nothin'.
First of all, shut your mouth, Bilgey.
Don't you know the biggest half of this loaf is yet to be plucked?
Sheriff?
We have a matter of utmost importance to discuss with you.
- Are they gone?
- Percy!
Are they gone?
They went for the sheriff.
I can't live a lie no more.
I just gotta tell you the truth.
First off, I ain't English.
My real name's George Jackson, and I'm on my way to visit my uncle Abner Moore.
What are you doing with our uncles?
Them two ain't your uncles.
They's just a couple of river sharks comin' to skin you for everything you got.
I didn't know just what they was into until I was too deep in it.
So I took your gold away from them last night.
I hid it in the safest place I could.
Well, where'd you hide it?
I can't tell you right now,
Miss Susan.
Not till them two's exposed.
'Cause they'd find a way to get it out of ya if you knew.
Sister, we can trust George here.
There's somethin' about him I like.
Friends, all.
Our dear brother Peter... your good friend and neighbor who lays yonder... has done generous well with his poor daughters that he's left behind in this vale of tears.
But these poor, orphan children are twice blighted.
A sneak thief has come in the night and robbed them of all of their cash money, so that all that they have left is what we are to auction here today so that their Uncle William and myself can take them back to England with a dowry fitting for them to marry well.
Now, what you see before you is a hand-wrought, hand-chased, hallmarked, sterling silver, genuine antique silver tea service with tray.
Do I hear $50?
How well I remember this gorgeous, six-piece tea service.
When our dear mother used to serve finger sandwiches and tea on the lawn of our estate in Sheffield, England.
No doubt she and Peter are gazing down on us at this very moment, hoping that one of you dear friends and generous neighbors will bring this priceless heirloom into your home.
Did you hear that, brother? $50!
- Do I hear 60?
- I'll bet 60.
$60, that gentleman right there.
- 75! Did you hear that, brother?
75... that's beautiful. 75.
- $100 right there.
- 150. That's gorgeous. Thank you.
150 going once,
150 going twice.
Bless you, sir.
Thank you very much.
- What did you say, sir?
165, the man with the beard.
Thank you very much. 165.
- 175! Thank you, sir.
- 175 going once.
Hallelujah! Did you hear that,
Mother and Brother? $200.
$200 going once,
$200 going twice...
Damn! Damn!
Somebody give me a hotfoot.
I thought he was supposed to be deaf and dumb.
The Lord has spoken!
He has His ways!
Let us not question them because they are beyond the comprehension of us poor mortals.
Let us pray!
Dear Lord, what are you trying to tell us?
What are you trying to say through our poor brother's afflicted mouth?
What heavenly thi...
Uh-oh.
Could anyone be so kind as to direct us to the Peter Wilks residence?
Uncle Harvey!
Uncle William!
I'm gonna get the sheriff!
Thank God you're really here!
Get them! Get them!
All right, you two frauds.
You're goin' to jail!
Jail's too good for 'em.
They hoodwinked the whole town.
- They oughtta be lynched!
- Yeah!
Yeah! Let's get 'em!
The idea of you lynching anybody.
Just 'cause you're brave enough to tar and feather some poor outcast women that come along here.
Why, a man's safe in the hands of 10,000 of your kind.
I was born and raised in the South, and I've lived in the North.
So I know the average all around.
The average man's a coward!
Your mistake is that you didn't bring a man with you to lead you.
You didn't go home and fetch your mask to cover your faces.
Half a man like him there yells,
"Lynch him! Lynch him!"
Well, I'll tell ya what you're gonna do.
You're gonna droop your tails and get along home and crawl in a hole.
Any real lynching's gonna be done around here, come back with your masks on!
Go on, get outta here, and take that half a man there with ya.
King, that really was a great speech.
Not bad. It was first delivered by a Colonel Sherburne down in Arkansas when they were about to lynch him.
Figured it might come in handy one of these days.
After you, sir.
Well, I knew it weren't the most reverent place to hide a couple of sacks of gold, but there weren't nowhere else, so I hid it in the coffin last night just before you came down to pray.
Well, I hope you explain to your two uncles that I didn't mean to be irreverent.
Well, I gotta go now.
See, somebody's waitin' for me.
My uncle, you know?
Good-bye, George Jackson.
And if I don't ever see you again,
I shan't forget you.
And I'll think about you many and many a time.
And I'll pray for you, too.
Oh, Jim.
Crocker says the barge'll be here in less than two hours.
Ain't soon enough for me.
Don't like this many on our hands.
I never can tell. Maybe some of them damn John Brown abolitionists is fixin' to ambush 'em on the river.
Happened two months ago near Orangeville. Got away with 17.
- Turned them all loose in Cairo.
- That John Brown's an idiot.
Who's gonna feed them and take care of them?
Set them free. It's a sin!
Alls I know, John Brown says owning niggers is a sin.
Yeah, but that only proves he's an idiot.
How many we got this time?
Twenty-four, countin' the new batch.
Three females and 21 bucks.
All right, let's get 'em ready.
Tie 'em up over here.
Move along now!
Move along!
No. Get away.
No.
She's mighty early, but it looks like the barge is comin'.
Could be.
The river's high, and the current's mighty strong.
Yeah, that's her, all right.
Better get 'em ready.
- When did he go?
- Just now.
Nigger Jim, d'you hear me?
You all come back before I kill every damn nigger in this stockade.
Stand up!
I know you're in there somewhere.
Jim, no.
All right.
Just you listen to this!
Other slaves in there are bought and paid for.
He'll never do it.
Now, that's one!
Now either give yourself up, or I finish off the rest.
Jim, no.
No. It's a trick.
I swear to ya.
It's a trick, Jim.
Come on.
He ain't gonna fall for that, and you know it.
Once Crocker gets here, we'll put the dogs on him.
Then he won't stand a chance in hell.
Let's get 'em ready for the barge.
Huck... Huck, I can't run no more.
I got... I gotta rest.
I'm all cramped up from bein' tied.
Jim...
Your blood's red... the same as mine.
You didn't know that before, Huck?
It was wrong of me...
I mean, it's wrong for you... for me to let you be out here with me like... like this.
Runnin' the risk of bein' caught like a... a damned "abolutionist."
Huck, I've been lyin' to you all along.
You been lyin'?
You don't need to run from your pap no more.
You don't need to run from anythin'.
You know that... that dead body
I found in that wrecked houseboat?
That was your pap.
I... I wanted to tell ya.
I wanted to tell ya right there, but...
I was... I was scared. I...
I was scared you'd run off and leave me
'cause you didn't need me no more and... well, I needed you.
You did the right thing back there.
I might've run off on ya.
I probably would've.
But now... I don't give a damn what the whole world says.
'Cause if I'm doin' wrong...
...well... well, I hope
I roast in hell forever!
- I can't...
- Gimme your shirt, Jim!
- What?
- Just gimme your shirt!
Now, the raft's on the river, a quarter of a mile or so in the cove.
Now, Cairo's just five miles on the other side.
Ain't you comin' with me?
When you get there, have somebody write a letter to
Judge Thatcher back to Hannibal for ya.
Say where you are,
'cause I'm gonna have the Judge send you your wife and your little girl.
Alls it takes is money, and I still got all of mine saved with the Judge.
I know I can spring enough loose for that.
No, Huck. That's... that's your money. I can't...
But, Jim, you're gonna open up a dry-good store in Cairo, ain't ya?
We'll need them to help us run the business.
We're partners.
Right?
Partners. Remember?
Right.
God bless you.
If there is a God up there... and I ain't sure if there is or there ain't... he'll hear me prayin' for ya, Jim.

Minus five, minus four... three, two, one.
Ignition.
We have separation.
What'll she do?
Stardust's mission is to explore the stars and planets of this galaxy and beyond.
I know that. I mean how fast will she go?
Stardust should definitely travel faster than light, which, as you all know, is 186,283.4 miles per second.
Wow! That's really pouring the coal to it!
We won't be using coal, Senator Milburn.
Stardust will actually collect atoms while in flight, ionising the medium ahead of the craft and guiding the ions into the intake area here.
This can be accomplished by the use of intense magnetic fields.
In just four and a half years, the craft could reach our nearest star, Alpha Centauri.
Aren't such speeds supposed to turn back the clock or develop a time warp?
This flight will put Einstein's
Theory of Relativity to the test.
The crew won't be aware of time passing.
- Did you say "crew"?
The ship is designed for two crewmen.
- You can stop right there, Doctor.
You intend to put fine young American men into that untried contraption and shoot 'em out into some never-never land?
That's oversimplifying it, but yes.
- Oh, no, you're not.
Not while I'm chairman of the Finance Ways and Means Committee of this project.
Not with the elections coming up.
- We have women in the space programme.
Women? No, sir.
Come up with another brainstorm, Doctor, or that baby's never gonna get out of this room.
Trimble here.
- What are you doing?
Transcendental meditation, sir.
- I'm taking you off that project.
You're going onto Humanoids.
- Human...?
Humanoids?
- I want a robot that walks, talks, the works!
Yes, sir!
It's a method of transportation known as an airplane.
Man uses it to fly through the air.
This is a woman. I am a man. You are modelled after me. She is the opposite sex.
We named him Hermes after the Greek god of speed.
We've managed to simulate an ordinary, average human body.
Not only does Hermes look human, but he has human reflexes and responses to a given situation.
Such as.
How do you feel, Hermes?
- (BLEEPS) Fine, thank you.
He talks, he reacts to shapes and stimuli.
He'll relay information on human anatomical compensation to interstellar flight almost as well as man.
Please, gentlemen, step up and say hello!
Well, Senator, we did it.
(TV) This spacecraft will travel farther and
faster than anything yet conceived by man. 
Stardust is designed and equipped
for exploration on distant planets. 
We're informed by Ground Control
that all systems are green,
but we're on hold
due to a technical problem. 
Hermes, the President is waiting.
What's holding things up?
I've got important guests out there.
Hermes doesn't want to go. He's afraid.
- Afraid? What's he afraid of?
That he won't ever come back.
It's possible. Hermes has thought the problem through.
Walter's asking about the delay.
Tell him it's a technical problem we're taking care of.
Zimmerman, I approved this contraption.
My committee chairmanship is riding on it.
You blow it and your budget next year won't be enough to build a paper plane!
Smedley, get Trimble to try and talk some sense into it.
Snap it up! There's a storm front coming in!
- Yes, sir.
Hermes, Hermes, I wanna talk to you.
Close the hatch.
What is this about you not wanting to go?
I'm afraid I'm never coming back.
- Of course you are.
What a silly thing to say.
Get into your nice white space suit.
Dr Zimmerman thinks it'll be good publicity.
You've put me in an embarrassing position.
What are people gonna think if we have to scrub this mission because you're afraid?
Come on, just put this thing on.
What's this?
Hermes!
Well, 30 years is 30 years, I suppose.
We'll forget the suit. Hermes, we've spent a lot of time and money on this mission...
Is that you, Hermes?
- No, it's Tom Trimble.
Get out of the picture, Trimble, you look awful. Where Hermes?
He's here. I think he's hurt, broken.
You've got to get us down!
Impossible, Trimble. We can't abort this mission now. Make yourself comfortable.
For 30 years?!
- Oh, it won't seem that long to you.
10 at the outside.
- I have agoraphobia and it's getting worse!
Relax or we can't get true readings on you.
Something else, Trimble.
When you get back, there'll be a surprise in your pay envelope. How's that sound?
Like a posthumous award!
- Ahem. Well, I have to go.
You won't have much to report until you reach star Vega, but keep in touch.
But...
Hermes, do something!
We've got to get this thing down!
Do what you were programmed to do.
I'm sorry. Your pulse staticizer probably got jammed when you bumped your head.
Don't worry, it's nothing that a soldering iron and a screwdriver can't fix.
I gotta get this thing into orbit.
Oh, no!
Oh, boy, the power's failing.
No... it's the sun rising and setting!
I gotta slow this thing down.
We'd best spend the night here, then get an early start for Camelot in the morning.
What was that?!
It's after us!
Shh!
Why would it stick its tongue out at us?
What's that?
Now you've done it! Fly for your life!
Oh, please, take me instead!
No contest! But, lady, you wouldn't believe what I've been through so... Where am I?
Bodney-on-Trent, Langdale Walk,
Bennington Green, Cornwall, England the year of our Lord 508... monster.
508! It really works!
You really can turn back the clock!
Here.
Albert Einstein, you really knew your stuff!
What is it you're after?
I have to figure a way to get back into orbit, rewind the clock and get back to the Cape.
Mm. Well, we must be going now.
Where?
- Camelot. It's four leagues... monster.
Why do you keep calling me monster?
- You have no face and no ears.
If I can get this off,
I'll show you what I look like inside.
Oh, I'm not that curious to look inside you.
Please, can we go now?
Wait! Who's in charge here?
I suppose I am. Mum died of the plague three years past.
And this is Father. Come on.
What's that she's consorting with?
- 'Tis too big for a troll.
Yet it's plainly not aggressive.
Are you certain you want to go to the castle?
They aren't always friendly to mons...
Strangers.
- I gotta get outta here.
Maybe in Camelot I can find a person who doesn't think I'm from outer space.
And where do you come from?
- Hey, easy with the stick!
I friend!
- Aiding fugitives is punishable by death.
I wasn't aiding anybody...
- You are my prisoner! Do you contest that?
No. Discretion is the better part of valour.
Very good. I must tell that to the King.
Lead on, prisoner, to Camelot!
Go on with your story.
- Well...
.. Sir Mordred wanted Father's land, but Father refused to give it up.
He believes that every freeman should own the land he works, isn't that right, Father?
What is that? They keep doing that.
They think you're a goblin.
Goblins come out in the evening.
Do you still think I'm a goblin?
- Heaven forbid.
I never thought it for an instant.
Goblins don't fly.
When did your father become a goose?
A gander!
- I don't believe it!
Oh, it's quite true.
- No, I mean the castle. That's Camelot?
It is.
- King Arthur's Camelot?
Come on.
When I returned from Haymarket, the gander was in Father's chair eating crumbs off the table.
So you figured it was your old man transformed by some evil spell.
What else could it be? Father was nowhere to be seen and the door was locked.
If only I could see Merlin.
I know he could make Father himself again.
Merlin? The magician?
- Yes.
How would the likes of you know Merlin?
- Oh, just by reputation.
Now, most gracious King Arthur,
I shall transform this pink-eyed white rat into vintage red wine.
If I were to turn you to stone, Sir Gawain, possibly I might continue uninterrupted.
Rattray... vanishay!
Et coldon hideway!
Howmay!
By my soul! That's wine! Wine!
And that concludes my dazzling display of black magic for this evening. Your servant.
Fear not, I have it subdued.
Your Majesty.
- Mordred, what have you in tow this time?
King Arthur, after the ceremony, I...
Your Majesty, with intention to rob, this creature and five like it fell upon me in the forest with firebrands and lances!
I despatched the others and spared this one as a curio for Your Majesty.
The head resembles a bug and I've not seen tentacles like that on a man creature before.
It's this space suit, Your Majesty.
In sand shoes, slacks and a blazer...
What are your plans for it? It's not large enough for a beast of burden.
I was thinking more along the lines of a burning.
Excellent suggestion, Mordred!
With Your Majesty's approval,
I could do something out of the ordinary with this creature.
What do you mean, burning?
Burn who? For what?
Burning is a fit punishment for the offence.
- Very well, then. A burning early tomorrow.
(PEOPLE) Burn him!
- When do I get my turn to bat? Wait, wait!
Wait! Let him speak.
I would know something of your plan.
- I could sell this better without this helmet.
Do you have a wrench around here?
- Wench? Wench?
We've several wenches. We don't usually make them available to captive... things.
However... Peg! Tend to its needs!
Within reason!
I think if you could get a head lock around here and twist...
Don't worry, you won't feel a...
That face!
Hi.
Er... you wanted to hear about my plan.
I suppose I should start with a little history or, in your case, a little future.
In... 1492, a man named Christopher Columbus is going to discover America.
America is another continent approximately 3,000 miles from here.
Columbus's ships will be named the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.
A lot of people think that Leif Ericson got there first. I don't know.
All I know is that all the banks are closed on Columbus Day, not Ericson Day.
Ericson Day!
So we jump a couple of hundred years...
So when Stardust blasted off prematurely,
I was trapped inside.
You recall my explanation of the law of gravity and how that theory is applied to orbiting objects.
Well, Stardust...
- Yes, yes, we all recall Madame Curie...
.. and Fulton's steamboat... and that imbecile who flew kites in the rain!
Just think what we could do with the likes of them today if they were not just the creation of your disordered BRAIN!
Those are the straight goods. It happened just the way I told you or, at least, it will!
And you seriously expect us to believe that you were alive 1,400 years from now?
Then why aren't you 1,400 years old?
- Well, that's a little difficult to explain.
With your permission, may I suggest we put an end to this travesty?
Agreed. Take him away.
- Wait a minute!
I can tell you how the Crusades come out!
Mordred tries to take over your kingdom!
Maybe with a little historical licence,
I can help you out, King!
I'm very good with a screwdriver!
Just listen...
Food for Sir Mordred's latest prisoner!
Sandi... over here.
Thing... I hardly recognised you without your head on!
Stop with that "thing" thing. This is getting serious. I'm gonna be burned at the stake.
Can you believe that?
Me, burned at the stake?
I heard. But, see, I've brought you something.
Clarence's hammer - to free you from your chains.
You did all this for me?
- Well, you've harmed no one.
You should be set free to return to your natural habitat.
You mean the USA.
- Yeah, mm.
Or the sky. Wherever you like it best.
When you get an idea in your head, you don't let go. Look at me closely.
Do I look like a monster to you?
Not any more, but you did when you came out of your shell breathing smoke.
No, that was steam. It was as hot as an oven in the capsule when I re-entered.
How does an ordinary man live in an oven?
This is a special suit. It resists heat.
Its even got its own temperature control - like a built-in air-conditioning system.
Now, between that and the asbestos mater...
Asbestos material!
I need a match.
Didn't that hurt?
- No, no. Here, hold that candle.
And that doesn't either!
I must go now.
- No reason to be afraid. I'll be safe.
This material is a mixture of a silicate of calcium and magnesium.
It doesn't conduct heat!
Now do you understand?
Of course.
No, Sandi, I'm no different from you or anybody... Ow!
What was that?
- Next room.
The man's got growing pains.
It can't last for long.
Are you all right?
Who... Who asks such a stupid question?
Tom Trimble. I'm Sir Mordred's prisoner.
- Satan himself.
He wants me to confess I killed one of his deer.
If I confess to his charge...
.. I must forfeit all my properties to him.
It is my only legacy to my beloved daughter Alisande.
Are you Sandi's father?
- You... You know my daughter?
Yes, yes!
- Poor child must think me dead.
Actually she thinks you're a goose.
- A goose? Her own father?
She must get word to our sovereign.
- Don't worry.
After I'm burned,
I'll tell the whole story to King Arthur.
Would it not show more foresight to tell him BEFORE the burning?
I had troubling dreams when I did sleep, Gawain.
Tell me, was it the Wright brothers who discovered radio?
I think not, Your Highness. That was.. er...
That was Babe Ruth.
And Uncle Milty was... will be the first man to fly, correct?
I believe he invents the horseless carriage, but I dozed off through that period.
He could be trained to be a court jester.
He tells the best lies we've ever heard.
True.
- Better even than Sir Mordred's.
How's that, Sir Gawain?
- When I say better, I mean different.
You tell the most excellent lies, Sir Mordred.
Of course you do!
Executioners, by His Majesty's gracious command, bring in the creature!
Look at the size of him!
- He's eaten a hearty last meal.
Clarence, could you reach inside my leg there?
Hold that till I get back.
There's some very good articles in it.
It is most brave. Isn't it, Father?
Er, King Arthur, could I please have a word with you after the burning?
After the burning?
Well, if he feels up to it, I see no harm.
Make sure it is bound securely.
(THE SUIT WHINES
LIKE A DEFLATING BALLOON)
It would appear it's suddenly wasting away.
Proceed while there's something left to burn.
Start the burning!
By my...!
Mordred, you're rarely at a loss for words.
What say'st thou?
Plainly he comes from hardy stock,
Your Majesty.
Merlin, fan the flames!
Merlin.
Do you think this creature has unholy powers?
Impossible!
I mean, Your Majesty, my liege,
I may have underestimated his capacities.
I'd rather he was with us than against us.
- We've already abused that option.
I can't have it roaming the halls of Camelot.
Mordred, it was all your doing.
And I should be the thing's undoing.
There is nothing to fear!
We have yet to see how this creature resists cold steel! Page!
Go inside and fetch my sword.
- Me?!
Thou jests!
- Thou art on thin ice! I bid thee obey!
You're in trouble. Mordred's looking for you.
- I must find the monster and help him.
He cannot defend himself against weapons, that we have seen.
What concern is that of yours?
- Clarence, perhaps he isn't a monster.
Did you see that?
With these eyes, but my heart refuses to accept it.
Come... we must help it escape.
Come on, Father.
Sandi, I can explain everything! I saw...
- There's no time!
Sir Mordred threatens to run you through!
- Clarence, lend a hand here.
(MORDRED) Page, I would have my sword!
- Is there a back door? A laundry chute?
No, and only the King can order the drawbridge lowered.
(MORDRED) I'll butcher that creature like a hung beef!
It's locked!
Surely you can defend yourself in some way!
Do you bite?
We have the finest selection of swords in the country here. Try one.
Isn't that King's Arthur's sword?
Oh, I knew it! Your heart is pure.
There's no time for that now. You'd better leave before Mordred gets here.
I couldn't bear to watch anyway.
Clarence, I don't know how to fight!
I must deliver Sir Mordred his sword.
If he thought I'd befriended thee...
- Listen, you have to help me!
Impossible! Mordred would boil me in oil!
- He'll never know!
I'm a lowly page, but I'll do what I can.
- Great! Now, which way is north?
Got a hammer?
- Only in the blacksmith's shop.
Anything'll do.
I'm gonna magnetise the sword.
"Magetise" it...?
- A solid blow will rearrange its molecules.
Hurry up, come on!
What delays thee, page? I'll skewer thee!
He wenteth that way.
It's taken refuse in the Great Hall.
- Where it will see its last moments.
Ahh!
It has taken on rust.
I have been putting my lance to use.
Mordred, please,
I have a knack for this sort of thing.
Are you going to be long?
You're holding up the midday meal.
I beg your indulgence, sire...
.. but my sword and I seem to be at odds.
He seems quite attached to it.
I hate to impose on you, Your Majesty, but would you be so kind?
I'll fillet thee like a flounder!
May I remind you, Mordred, that you are a knight of the Round Table?
Ohhh!
If you'd be so kind.
- Is that fair?
A good knight must use his own judgement.
- Sir Mordred is one of our own.
Release it quickly!
- I find it impossible to oblige you.
It is metal it attracts.
Touch not metal with the blade.
- His head be not of metal!
Guards, stay fast!
Now, Mordred, put an end to it!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Oh, dear, what a pity.
Sir Lancelot! Is he here?
- He's taken leave.
Something about rescuing a maiden.
- I heard he was into that.
Sir BrandeI.
Ah... here's Sir Galahad.
- Sir Galahad.
I can't wait to get home and tell the folks about this.
I've gotta get back to the 20th century.
- You keep saying that.
How can one go back to the 20th century when we're in the 6th?
I'll figure it out.
- Tell me, Tom, please.
I promise not to let it go past this room.
Where exactly do you come from?
Do you remember when I told you about Columbus...
Wait, wait, wait. I can't go into that again.
Bugs, the jitter, Beatles, the throw rocks...
- No, no, play rock.
You'll understand better when I show you Stardust.
Ah, Sir Mordred.
King... No, never mind.
What is it?
I don't like to get mixed up in office politics, but sources tell me Mordred has a sideline.
Sideline?
- He's moonlighting.
He has a guy on the rack, trying to force him to confess to poaching so that Mordred can rip off his land.
What?! That's a serious charge against a knight. I trust you have proof.
Oh, I do. Follow me.
- Wait!
A king does not follow a captive, however weird he may be.
Sorry, King, go ahead.
Downstairs and to your left, King.
Sir Mordred put him down here.
Poor guy's just skin and bones.
It appears he's wasted away to nothing.
- If indeed he ever was here.
Mordred, I'm told you're involved in a... what?
Land grab.
- Wresting property from free men.
A blatant lie, Your Majesty!
My honour had been impugned.
I demand satisfaction on the field!
- Again?!
He has that right, though I've lost some good knights that way.
Maybe I made a mistake.
Maybe he said Moorhead, not Mordred.
A joust to the death!
- You wouldn't change that to chess?
Chess? To the death?
- I demand satisfaction!
Oh, dear. Tut tut tut. So be it.
It shall be decided tomorrow.
I'll tell you one thing! No more nice guy me!
- I think you can safely say that.
(WHISPERS) Clarence, are you alone?
- Go away.
My hours are numbered as it is.
I've got a proposition for you.
This is yours to keep if you'll help me get outta here.
If you don't fight Sir Mordred, you'll be banished from England for ever.
That still beats a sharp stick in the chest.
What do you say?
There's a rope by the old chapel.
I'll be there at...
What's that?
- 9 o'clock.
OK.
What news upon my worthy opponent?
- We've searched the castle. He has fled.
Obviously he's cast his spell on the guards and fled, which gives little satisfaction to me!
If he has not made an appearance soon, we'll consider him vanquished.
And with it, I trust, his heinous charges against Sir Mordred, my liege.
Hello, what's this?
Oh, Father, he looks so handsome!
All in white with his little red, white and blue flag.
We must give him something to take into battle and his world beyond.
You shall not have your victory without bloodletting after all.
My pleasure! Let's get on with it!
Oh, Thomas, it would make me most proud if you'd carry something of mine into battle.
Please, wear this.
Oh, it's from Father, too.
- (BLEEPS) Thank you.
Is it over yet?
- Not yet.
But the maid Alisande is talking to your twin brother.
He's not my brother. Sandi?
- Yes.
He's a humanoid, a robot.
When we reset his staticizer,
I programmed him to joust for me.
Well, if thou say so.
Thomas...
.. I wouldn't dare speak like this
if I ever had to face you again. 
But since you're going to be killed, I see no harm in revealing my feelings for you.
Clarence, I think she likes me!
- We really have no time for this.
If one of Sir Mordred's servants found us here, I dare not contemplate his wrath.
OK.
All right, Hermes, that's enough.
Put her down and get on with the joust.
He's programmed to react, but this is sheer insubordination.
Hermes, put the girl down and go on with the joust. That's an order.
(BLEEPS) You feel soft.
I feel soft?
That's it? That's all you have to say?
- (BLEEPS) Later.
There is no later. I can turn you off as fast as she can turn you on!
Get what thou seeks and let us vacate these chambers.
You're right.
Giddy-up.
Should somebody should tell him his arm's missing?
I cannot intercede. I made the rule.
How's it going?
Ah, look at that.
Hermes, turn around and do it again.
You just have to keep going till you can't go any longer.
How's Hermes doing?
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
He seems to have lost his head.
- Hermes is cool.
Oh, you mean REALLY lost his head!
I'm sorry, Hermes, but this is to save England.
I have seen similar phenomena in chickens, My Lord.
This is England, sire.
Sir Mordred.
Can you not put an end to this?
It has long ceased to be sport.
As Your Majesty knows, tradition demands he must yield or die!
Well, at least it's out of its misery. Come.
The contest is over down there.
- How's Hermes?
Done for.
- Maybe I can put him together again.
All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't do that.
Look at this! This is it! Just wait till King
Arthur gets a load of this! C'mon, let's go!
Pity. I was becoming rather attached to it, whatever it was.
It will no longer be a source of torment.
I've despatched it from our midst for all time.
With your permission, I will keep these remains for my laboratory...
.. and gain an insight into its origins and feeding habits.
Yes, well, do as you please, Merlin, but tidy up thoroughly.
Merlin... Oh, I'm sorry.
Might I prevail upon you to change my father over there into his old self?
It's seems...
- Later, later, my child!
More important matters demand my attention.
You and your father can wait in my quarters.
Wait a minute!
Everybody, stay right where you are!
Merlin, keep your mitts off Hermes!
Sandi, I'm all right.
- You are?
This is too much!
You reproduce yourself like a lizard's toe!
You change colours like a chameleon!
- I have documentary proof that Mordred is acquiring territory, arms and men for a takeover.
How did you acquire such holdings?
I see you've been levying your own taxes.
To what ends, Sir Mordred? Well?
To take over Camelot and, with it, England.
He sees himself in your chair, King.
Seize that knight!
- Death to Arthur!
Stop him!
Gawain, there's something unholy about this.
Wouldn't it be better to let him rest in peace?
Perhaps a dandelion poultice would help.
It's not as bad as I thought.
I can bypass his synthesiser and keep his command analyser functioning.
Maybe you can do something about Father.
- I told you, I saw your father. I talked to him.
Are you certain? He's about 12 stone and five-foot-nine.
He may be a little taller than that now.
We must thank you for revealing Mordred's treachery. Is there no way we can repay you?
No. I'm glad to help out.
We must inspect the castle defences.
I'm worried about Mordred's attack.
I may be able to help out there.
Hmm.
Hang in there, Hermes, we'll have you up and about in no time.
OK.
- No hard feelings about the joust?
You are so brave, Hermes.
Oh, don't worry, he's resting comfortably.
Clarence, weren't you supposed to help hide the valuables?
So... er...
.. how would you like a personally conducted tour of Stardust?
Oh... I think not.
I've got some LPs you haven't heard.
Fleetwood Mac, Rolling Stones.
Thanks, anyway.
Hey... why the hot and cold bit?
Didn't you say before the joust that you felt... pangs?
Oh, Thomas, I made an awful fool of myself.
I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
I bared my heart to... to your brother here and it turns out that he's full of wiggly things and smoke.
Look, Sandi, I'm just as human as you are.
I've got a mother and a father.
He's an optometrist in Poughkeepsie.
I squeaked through high school, but I did get a masters at college and lettered in baseball.
I took Mona Shanks to the senior prom and struck out there.
I've got a good job. What more do you want?
I am just an average American boy!
Don't you understand that?
No!
Oh, come on, Father.
Maybe we can get to see Merlin now.
Keep a sharp eye.
Fear not, sire, we shall defend our castle, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beach heads, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the courtyards and in the halls, we shall never surrender!
I'll be darned!
- Well said, Winston!
They'll probably come from the north.
- They'll come from the south.
Mordred will make an assault on the gates with battering rams and superior forces.
They'll have to bridge the moat first.
I have the answer to that.
You do?
- Yes, sir.
See that hay cart down there?
- We can all see the hay cart.
What wizardry hast thou now?
- This is called a laser gun.
Hermes was supposed to use it on planets for collecting rock samples.
You pull the trigger there and don't point it at anything that you wanna keep.
A cart is a cart. Let's see how effective it is against the stone walls of Camelot.
Wait one second.
OK, OK.
- Now?
Well, what do you think?
- Well...
I have always had the highest regard for you, Tom.
I remain, sire, your most obedient servant.
Gawain, please, cease thy fawning prattle.
This is very dangerous. Be careful it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
Don't worry, King, I keep it handy at all times.
Oaf... it's going to be impossible for Mordred to take Camelot with that American and his magic candle.
Oaf kill!
No. Arthur would have an immediate investigation.
There's more than one way to skin a cat, though it could get pretty sticky!
Find that demented girl and tell her the magician will see her in the lower chambers.
And I will take care of the American.
You understand what you are to do, Oaf?
Now, you be nice to the magician when he sees you. He's there to help.
Merlin is expecting us.
The first visit is two gold coins payable at time of treatment.
The magician will see you now.
Well, my dear, what is the matter?
I'm all right, sire, it's Father...
Let me go! Let me go!
Get rid of that accursed goose!
Don't eat it!
There'll be feathers all over the place!
Let me go!
Where is she?
- I know not, sire.
I was told that she would meet you here.
She wanted to hear some of your... LPs.
Thanks.
Fiendishly clever, the American.
Who else would've thought to hide it there?
But he did not reckon with the clairvoyant powers of the invincible Merlin!
Will it make a big noise again?
- Hope not.
I had the cotton packed too tightly last time.
That's why it exploded.
He's trying to get thrust to propel the craft into the air. Can't you see that?
Very good, Hermes.
- ( BLEEPS) Where's Sandi?
Forget about her. I cooled my heels for three hours waiting for her. She and I are through.
You put her out of your mind, too.
- (BLEEPS) That's not easy.
OK, here goes.
Hey!
I'm terribly sorry.
Use that dagger when Mordred attacks.
- I think I can fix it.
Hey, what have you got there?
- It's a goose, as anyone can plainly see.
It's a gander. Where did you find him?
- It was on the moat.
Then it flew up to the parapet.
He'll make a splendid supper.
No, he won't. Keep him in protective custody.
And... not that I care, but... where was the girl?
There was no girl about, just him.
I did hear a woman scream from yon wood.
- I saw her with Oaf, going to Merlin's room.
That quack?
King, I think we're in trouble.
You haven't misplaced her there?
- The laser gun's gone.
Who'd take it?
- Merlin!
He lured me out by saying Sandi would meet me.
Merlin and Mordred?
- Absolutely! They're in cahoots!
Where?
- They're partners. Where'd he take her?
The seaside is awfully nice this time of year.
Please!
- This is serious!
Mordred's camp, no doubt.
- We've got to do something!
Don't look at me.
- I'll take care of it myself.
You're not going after the wench?
- The poor kid needs help!
I got it! King, I need your armour.
Oh, really!
You keep forgetting you're a prisoner. I don't lend prisoners my armour. The answer is no.
Then Mordred will reduce Camelot to dust.
Well, perhaps my workaday armour.
No, your Sunday go-to-meeting armour, the shiniest you've got!
Page, fetch it.
Sounds like some monstrous cat.
- Like none I've ever heard.
What has it coughed up now?
It's a fine cart, but where do the oxen go?
- King, this is a battery-powered lunar rover.
This is the soil sampler... I'll explain later.
Clarence, buff me up.
I can't understand this fuss over a girl. I can find you five girls more comely than that one.
But not as dingy. Lower the drawbridge!
- I saw when the bridge is to be lowered!
I told you that.
- I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.
Lower the bridge!
Hold the fort until I get back.
Alas, we won't see him again.
This passageway will give us access to the castle.
At dawn, you will engage the defenders until the drawbridge can be lowered.
Won't this passage be defended?
- It is my secret passage.
The King has no knowledge of it.
- We'll do our best.
Have your men present in force when the portcullis is raised.
Enough to crush all resistance!
- Sire!
Sire, something approaches the camp.
- Something?
It has two eyes that light up the night and makes strange breathing sounds.
Call out the guards!
It is the American. He has taken the bait.
It's King Arthur himself.
- No, it's Tom Trimble.
I've come for Alisande.
- You shouldn't have come! They'll kill you!
With your choice of weapons!
- Get behind me.
That will serve little purpose. We have seen the awesome power of the magic candle.
It will annihilate you both in a flash.
Now, Mordred, do the honours.
Any parting words, American?
- I'd like to speak to Sandi for a second.
Be brief.
- All right.
Sandi, I just want you to know that I groove on you.
My idea of heaven would be to split a pizza and a 6-pack while watching the Super Bowl, maybe smooch a little at the half.
Well, what do you think?
- Any news of Father?
Didn't you hear? I told you I loved you!
- I'm not going all through that again.
On the other hand, if it's between you and Oaf...
.. I'll take you.
- Great! Pull down my visor. Get behind me.
Yes.
(TOM) Fire at will, Mordred!
Mordred, cease before you destroy your entire force.
He has bewitched it!
Stop them!
Oaf, hold these two! I'll settle with them later!
On to the tunnel!
Six o'clock and all's well!
(WHISPERS) Come on!
Oaf... Oaf... look.
To eat. You... eat.
Sit on my lap!
- No!
Sit on my lap!
Put your arm around me. It's safer.
Are you taking me to your nest?
- No, Camelot.
I hope it's got the same landlord when we get there!
Capture the gatehouse!
Look, sire, it's Tom!
- Ahhhhhh!
Well done!
Once more! The gatehouse!
Ahhhhh!
Come on!
Stand to!
(MORDRED) Lower the drawbridge!
Raise the portcullis!
Thank you, Tom. Well done.
Thank you. Well done.
Never have so many owed so much to one man.
What a nice thought.
Hah!
Look out!
Stop those bowmen!
Oh, really! I've told you before, never turn your back on the enemy. It's dangerous.
It's no way to be found after the battle.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Clarence! Sandi! The winch!
Come, Clarence, hurry!
Free the winch!
No, no! No, no, no!
OK, lower me down to the ledge.
We're to lower him to the ledge.
Make them pay dearly for every inch!
Hermes...
.. activate all systems.
Fire rocket engines one, two and three.
This American's wings must be clipped if we are to save the day.
Do not fear the contrivance! It has no power!
(TOM) Engage left thruster. 
Activate thrusters as your sensors warn of approaching danger.
Whoa! Take me back up to the ledge!
- You're too heavy!
# Oh, say can you see... #
Hermes, close the hatch.
Not so fast!
Destroy the American! He is our nemesis!
Hermes, set both magnetic fields on pulse.
He must be destroyed! Get him!
- Go on!
Get him!
A purse for the man who finishes him!
Increase power of magnetic fields.
Clarence, it's getting heavier!
The King said this armour was solid gold.
It's not.
I think he's in trouble.
- What kind?
It's difficult to say, but don't look, Sandi.
Ahhhhhhh!
Hermes, cut the power!
Come on, Father.
King, take 'em downtown and book 'em.
- Thank you, Tom.
We owe you our kingdom.
Victory!
Hooray! Hooray!
Gee, I don't know what to say.
Such distinguished company.
King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad...
Sir Gawain.
- Sir Gawain.
I will retire this chair and if ever you return, your place at the Round Table will be here.
Boy, they're never gonna believe this at the Cape! Yes, they will!
Everybody, group up there for the photograph.
The what?
- I'll show you in a minute.
Bunch in. Sandi, you and your father get over here. Clarence, scrunch in next to the king.
Put your arm around him, King.
Hurry up! And everybody say cheese!
(ALL) Cheese?
Now, King, this is what I mean by a photograph.
That's me!
- Yes, the whole gang!
King, you take this. When Merlin gets out, it'll drive him bananas.
Bananas?
- Yep.
Er... Sandi, could I talk to you for a second?
Well...
.. I'm going now.
I wish I could take you with me.
There's so many things I'd like to show you.
My old MG, my ten-speed.
The Space Mound, the Grand Canyon.
That would be very nice.
But I just don't know if you'd survive the trip.
You could age 1,000 years before we re-entered.
I understand and thank you for getting Merlin to change my father back into his old self.
Sure.
Would... Would you give this to Hermes, please?
Sure.
Bye.
Clarence, I wanna thank you.
You helped change the course of history.
Did I?
- You certainly did.
Thank you, Hermes.
This is a token of our appreciation.
If it fails, will he stay with us?
- We have a place for him in the chapel.
But...
- Don't bother me. I've important work to do.
It's from his Uncle Sam.
- Really? How nice.
Minus 10 and counting.
- Let's see if we can get off the ground.
Ignition.
Blast off.
We have lift-off.
We did it!
From Sandi.
"Dear Hermes, I think you are sweet and I will remember you fondly,
"but there can never be anything serious between us.
"I have given the matter a lot of thought and I like Tom best,
"but it was not an easy decision. Alisande. "
Ready?
Is the clock winding the right way?
Year 680.
- Good man.
Robot.
We're travelling 290,000 miles a second and someone wants us to move over?
So that's where you've been lately.
Look at that. "Father" laid an egg!
How could we have been so wrong (?)
- Not bad for a goose over 100 years old.
You're right.
You're right! He... She hasn't changed a bit!
Look at her feathers, look at her eyes!
That means that Sandi wouldn't age either!
Hermes, right thruster - 180 degrees!
What on earth will you do with her?
- You mean, what will I do with her on earth?
Live happily ever after. Isn't that what you're supposed to do in a situation like this?
- (MAN) Good evening.
- I'm Professor Ivarsson.
Yes, Sir Anthony has been expecting you.
It's in your hands, Milo.
- Stand fast. They'll come to terms.
- Very well.
If problems come up, consult with the board.
They know my thinking.
Ah, Professor Ivarsson.
I cannot tell you how grateful I am you've joined me.
I haven't agreed to anything.
Someone woke me up at 6.00 yesterday morning saying he was the
British ambassador.
It was the British ambassador.
He'd arranged my passage on a mail-boat to England, and a large man packed my bags and drove me to the dock.
- Your train leaves in ten minutes.
- Good. Come along, Ivarsson.
But the... Sir Anthony.
Expedition to the Arctic?
I'm hardly a professional explorer.
No, let me finish.
- I've had you looked into.
- Oh.
You're an American from the University of Minnesota, currently a guest lecturer at the University of Christiania.
Your specialty is the archaeology of the North.
In the past, you've led several successful expeditions.
You've done interesting work in Greenland.
Oh, no. You're the right man for the job, all right.
For what job? What's so urgent about it? What is it you hope to find?
My... son.
You see, my wife died when Donald was a child.
I began to groom him to take my place in the business.
I pushed him too hard, I think.
Anyway, we had words.
And suddenly,
Donald dropped everything and went off on a whaling ship as an ordinary seaman.
Three months later, I got word that he'd left the ship in Bathenland.
Why?
I had no idea until I received this from a trading post at Fort Conger on Ellesmere Island.
Donald had left it with the factor for safe keeping when he had gone off on some sort of expedition.
When he didn't come back, the factor sent it on to me.
(IVARSSON) It's an old page from a Hudson's Bay Company journal.
Look at the entry for January 15, 1856.
"To this post, this day came
John Merchison with his Eskimos,
"who hunt the white bear far beyond the land's end.
"He told of seeing a lone cloud, as if lying on the ice,
"and hidden beneath it, an island.
"This island, he sought to examine, but his Eskimos refused him,
"saying it's guarded by evil spirits.
"For it's the place where the whales go to die."
- We're coming into Dover now.
- Thank you.
Sir Anthony, the graveyard of whales is just a fantasy, a whaler's El Dorado, where he thinks he's going to find a fortune in whalebone and ambergris.
Fact is, it simply doesn't exist.
It's a legend, nothing more.
Legend or not, the graveyard is what my son went after.
It's my son I'm looking for.
- (MAN) Quarters?
- Take our luggage to the admiral DPO.
Sir Anthony, I'm afraid this has to be the end of the line for me.
I'd help if I could. I know how much this means to you.
But you're trying the impossible.
To try to find one man with nothing more than a page from a journal...
There is something more.
Donald also left this with the factor.
I was hoping you might know what it was.
Hm. It's a carved bone. It's Eskimo work. It's quite common in the Arctic.
- This one's a map.
- (ANTHONY) Map?
If I had a chart,
I could show you how this works.
My yacht is at the pier.
You can have all the charts you need.
(IVARSSON) This pattern will correspond to part of the shoreline here on the chart.
Look.
See how this matches.
It's not exactly to scale, of course.
(ANTHONY) Then this red mark could be what we're looking for.
If there were such an island.
- Why shouldn't there be?
- There's no land here.
It's just a gigantic frozen sea.
All explorers agree.
Peerey, Nance and all of them.
And what is Ivarsson's opinion?
Of course, there's a lot they haven't covered.
But if there were such an island, if the graveyard of whales really did exist...
The world will never know, will it?
Unless you discover it, or unless someone else beats you to it.
Sir Anthony, you're a devious man.
Yes, I am, aren't I?
I've got your contract here.
Your leave from the university.
Power of attorney. My solicitors will handle your affairs in your absence.
- We're under way.
- And have been for some time.
We'll be in France in the morning.
Why France? That's hardly the most direct route to Fort Conger.
On the contrary.
I think you'll find that it is.
Can't you slow him down?
You'd think we were leaving tomorrow morning.
We are.
What?
I said, we are.
First thing in the morning.
Impossible. It's winter.
No ship can get through the ice before spring.
- I've made other arrangements.
- What arrangements?
If I told you, you'd think I was mad.
Sir Anthony, you are mad.
And now you're gonna meet another mad one. Capt. Brieux!
Ah, Monsieur Ross!
What a pleasure!
He was building this for Americans, but he ran through all their money.
I heard of it and took it over.
- Ah, Capt. Brieux.
- Good evening, Sir Anthony.
- Professor Ivarsson.
- I'm honoured.
- Do you mind if I take a closer look?
- No, please.
I'm proud we'll have you for the ceremony tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
- What ceremony?
- Why, the first flight of my creation.
Tomorrow, the whole world will know of me on my Hyperion.
France will rule the air!
Whatever you planned, cancel it.
Tomorrow, we leave for the Arctic.
The Arctic?
The Arctic?
Sir Anthony, that's ridiculous!
It can't be done.
That's impossible.
We would need food, supplies, fuel for the motors.
The fuel, I'll leave to you, Captain.
All other necessities have been amply provided by my staff.
I think it is best that we have an understanding.
We have an understanding.
I bought and paid for your airship.
It's mine.
I intend to use it to find my son, who is lost in the Arctic.
But I cannot do it without your help.
I can offer you nothing except hardship and danger, except your place in history.
- History?
- Think of it, Captain.
You have an opportunity which comes but once in a generation.
The world will know you not only as the first man to fly over the Arctic, but the first man, perhaps, to brave the North Pole itself.
Today, we make history.
There should be flags, music, a speech from the president.
But what do we have?
Two children and a herd of goats.
When you bring her back to France, the celebration's gonna break all records.
- We are ready to depart.
- Very good, carry on.
Silence!
There will be no speaking.
Well, we are on our way.
A glorious day, Monsieur.
We rise with the sun.
Congratulations, Captain.
This will be a morning to remember.
Something in the food hamper just bit me.
That is not the food hamper, that is the small boudoir of Josephine.
It's some kind of a dog.
Of course, the best kind: French.
I am not interested in its nationality.
- Who brought it aboard?
- No one brought her aboard.
She lives here. This is her home since the airship was begun.
(ANTHONY) I'm not running some kind of flying kennel.
Get rid of it.
Very well, if you wish, Monsieur.
Of course, it will take time.
The sun has warmed the gas.
We must wait until night to return to the hangar.
- Then bring back the ground crew.
- Wait until night?
That will mean 12 hours.
I can't lose the time.
You're absolutely right, Sir Anthony.
Congratulations, Josephine.
We've signed on our ship's mascot.
Very well, but I don't like small dogs, and I never did.
Britain may rule the waves,
Sir Anthony, but the French airship rules the sky.
Already, we are speeding in triumph across the shores of your homeland.
It's raining as usual, I see.
- How far have we come?
- About 150 miles.
Hundred and fifty? In six hours?
Is that what you call
"speeding in triumph"?
We'll travel faster, but now my motors are at half-speed.
What on earth for?
Damn you!
- They must run themselves in.
- Poppycock!
I want full speed!
There are the controls.
If you want full speed, it is your responsibility, not mine.
What do you say now, Sir Anthony?
I say, I want full speed.
And I mean to have it.
You have your wish, Monsieur.
It's on your head.
- What's happening?
- Somebody route the propeller.
I followed your orders, Monsieur, and you see the result.
Now we must go back to France for repairs.
We will not.
We will proceed on one propeller.
The Arctic winds!
That would be insanity!
Without full power, my airship could not survive.
- I refuse to go forward.
- And I refuse to go back.
Well, gentlemen, we have to go somewhere.
Captain, you carry a spare propeller, don't you?
- That is right.
- Well, why don't we put it on now.
- In midair?
- Mm-hm.
- Impossible!
- Nothing's impossible.
Splendid idea, Ivarsson.
Come along. Give me a hand.
Sir Anthony!
May I remind you that I am in command here!
Only an idiot would attempt such a thing.
I will do it myself.
Do be careful and don't take any unnecessary risks.
Take good care.
The wind's coming up.
Let's haul him up.
Well done, Captain.
My congratulations.
Thank you, Sir Anthony.
I am deeply honoured.
What's he up to now?
Vive le France!
Top fellow, Brieux.
- The man's incredible.
- Brave, but mad as a hatter.
Musk ox.
Over there.
What are they doing?
They're forming a defensive ring.
They think we are attacking.
Captain, is it really necessary to fly so low?
It's easier to control the airship at this altitude.
No need to be alarmed, Sir Anthony.
Look, I'm in full command.
You made your point, Captain.
There's no need to overdo it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Take hold of the lines.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Now, what I don't understand is, why
Donald took only one Eskimo with him.
Only one could be persuaded to go.
They all knew what he was looking for.
The mythical island, where the whales go to die.
One man's myth is another man's gospel, Mr Ivarsson.
Anyway, the Eskimos believe the island exists.
They're frightened to death of it.
Say it's guarded by evil spirits.
What about the Eskimo who went with him?
Oomiak's his name.
They call him "The Fearless One".
Though he was far from fearless when he came back.
- He came back.
- (MAN) Aye.
That's him out there.
Showing the captain how to fly his airship.
Fetch the fellow. Call him in.
I'm afraid you won't get anything out of him.
Call him in at once. Don't argue.
Very well, Sir.
Any man that goes off with my son and comes back alone...
- I'll see that he talks, all right.
- You'd better let me handle him.
You've never dealt with Eskimos.
They have a diplomacy all their own.
Blasted.
Why doesn't anyone think I have tact?
Come along, Oomiak.
Ah, so there you are.
What I want is an exact account of everything that happened...
Sir Anthony, this is the great Oomiak.
Who knows Oomiak?
Your fame has travelled far.
What fame?
Not even my dogs know me.
You were my son's guide.
What happened to him?
Who?
This is the father of Donald Ross.
We wanna know about your trip...
Tell us what happened when you left here to find the island.
- Island?
- Don't try to play that game with me.
Oomiak, I think you've seen this before.
This is where the whales go to die.
It's the island Donald was looking for.
Well, speak up, man.
My mind forgets.
Is The Fearless One afraid to help us?
We travelled many days.
Evil spirits watch us when we find island.
They make big blizzard.
Pshh.
Then they attack us.
I fight like bear. Ah!
Fight like bear, but evil spirits too strong!
So you ran away and left my son?
No, we both run, blind in snow.
When blizzard stop,
I search for many hours.
No Donald.
I tell truth.
You, Donald's father.
I, Donald's friend.
- His whole story is a pack of lies.
- Maybe.
But he's the only chance we have.
He could show us where he lost him and start searching there.
I don't suppose there's any chance he'd go.
No, Sir, none at all.
Nothing on earth would make him go back.
Nothing on earth.
Why don't you let one of them on.
He can tell the others about it.
- No. You let one aboard...
- What about this fellow?
He's been a great help. Would you like to see the inside of the airship?
Me?
- Yes, I like.
- (ANTHONY) Good man.
Give him a hand, Captain.
Why don't you show him around.
- Perhaps we can win him over.
- Well, we can try.
Captain, a word with you.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Captain?
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
No, no, no, Monsieur.
Quite impossible.
There is no room, and we are overloaded now.
We could leave the mechanic.
Pick him up on the way back.
You ask me to fly without the mechanic?
But you have me.
Just tell me what to do.
I could, but you wouldn't do it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like we're ready to leave.
I better take you down.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Let go the lines there.
Wait, Oomiak's still onboard.
Hang it all, he's the only one who knows where Donald went to.
We could bring him back after he's helped us to find him.
Sir Anthony, since
I no longer have a mechanic, may I suggest that you first make fast the door, then go aloft and take in the landing lines.
Aye, aye, Captain.
We're here.
We can only guess how far the island is.
This Eskimo map is a little vague.
(ANTHONY) It's a lot to gamble on a piece of bone.
He's not much help to us either.
Did you expect him to be?
- (IVARSSON) Sir Anthony.
- Yes?
(IVARSSON) Come up, please.
There's been a report.
- (ANTHONY) What is it?
- Look over there.
- Whales.
- White whales.
Beluga. Indigenous to the Arctic.
Now look over there.
I say, that one's quite different.
The California grey. It's supposed to be found only in the Pacific.
A narwhal, the unicorn of the sea.
That's a rare sight, Sir Anthony.
By Jove, there are whales everywhere.
All kinds of whales.
And all moving in the same direction.
Exactly.
So there is a place where whales go to die.
Captain, that big lead of open water.
Follow it.
If we are on the right track, we'd have seen something.
Look. You remember the journal?
"A lone cloud, as if lying on the ice."
Oomiak.
Is that where the island is?
Wrong way. Wrong way.
Island not that way.
Island back this way.
- He told us what we wanted to know.
- Yes.
Steady as you go, Captain.
Look.
And hidden beneath the cloud, an island.
Captain. What happened?
Captain.
Captain, why are we stopping?
In such a cloud, it's not safe to proceed.
Not safe? What do you mean?
I could not see to navigate, and there will be strong winds.
My airship could be dashed against hidden cliffs and torn apart.
- We can't turn back now.
- We don't have to.
- We can go in on foot.
- Oh.
Capital idea!
Take the ship down to the ice.
- I'll get everything ready.
- No, no. You cannot leave the ship!
Professor, you know the dangers that lie below.
Even if you survive the cold, there are still the cliffs.
- You could not climb the cliffs.
- We must try, Captain.
I know. It's a gamble, Captain.
But with my son's life at stake,
I have no choice.
No, Sir Anthony, it is I who have no choice.
I'm not a man of stone.
There are times when the heart must rule the head.
We will attack the cloud.
- Maybe we can go above them.
- Impossible.
- Our load is too heavy.
- We'll assume lightweight.
Hurry up! We are losing height.
- You all right?
- Yes, quite.
I can't help thinking of the captain.
Poor fellow.
- How long must we keep this up?
- We can't survive in the open.
We've gotta keep moving until we find shelter.
There should be caves in those mountains.
Oomiak, is this anything like the place that you and Donald came to?
I tell you, Donald's father, we see nothing in blizzard.
Then spirits come and...
And you fought like a bear.
Yes, you mentioned that.
- Somebody watches.
- Where?
I don't see.
I feel.
Tommyrot.
Something moved.
- Did you see anything?
- I don't think so.
Neither did I.
I think we should head in that direction.
Oh, very well.
If you don't know where you're going, one way's as good as another.
It's incredible.
- I don't believe it.
- (ANTHONY) Green and fertile.
In all this ice and snow.
Look. There's the explanation.
The island must be volcanic.
Heat rising through fissures in the ground.
It's probably thermal springs.
Exactly like parts of Iceland.
There are buildings down there.
- (IVARSSON) Looks like a settlement.
- People. There are people there.
That means that Donald could be there.
The spirit! The spirit!
Wait a minute.
No, wait. We're friends.
Do you understand their language?
It's Norse.
The Old Norse of the sagas.
Their weapons, their clothes, their appearance.
- They're Vikings.
- Vikings?
They think we're invaders, come to take over their land.
- The three of us?
- No.
They think we're the first and thousands more will follow.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Talk to them.
Explain why we're here.
I'll try, but I've never spoken
Old Norse, only read it.
Donald?
That's it. Donald Ross.
Where is he?
Tell them I'm his father.
What is it? What's going on?
He understood me.
But he's going to sound an alarm to stir up the countryside.
We're to be kept under close guard.
Well, that's not good.
If they think we're invaders, then Donald could have been a prisoner all these months.
Make them tell us where he is.
Oomiak, no!
Idiot.
He might have got us all killed.
But he does fight like a bear.
He says you saved his life.
Well, I'm glad he appreciates it.
But tell him I don't want anything to happen to Oomiak.
Thank you.
He says your son is here and well.
He's living with the family of the man who found him after the great blizzard.
I knew it. I knew he was safe.
- (ANTHONY) What's happening?
- We're stopping to eat.
We just had a talk with our friend and found out why they're so panicky about invaders.
Oh? Why?
These people have been here for centuries.
They're descendants of some early Viking expedition.
We've actually discovered a lost colony.
That's quite remarkable.
They've been so isolated up here they believe that the rest of the world is a frozen wilderness of ice and snow.
How very odd.
- None of them ever left the island.
- They have no reason to.
They call this island Astragard and believe it to be the garden of the gods.
Perfect and unique in a desolate world and set aside for them alone. Forever.
- Why do they feel invaded?
- Because they have a prophecy.
There'll be a day when the barbarians will try to conquer their paradise.
Mm.
So that explains it.
They think that we're the savages who've come to destroy them.
Could be a bit tricky.
As soon as I get to their headman,
I'll straighten things out.
(IVARSSON) Reindeer.
Probably serve them as cattle.
That's the house where Donald's living.
Donald is there? Well, come on!
My son.
I haven't seen him for two years.
Tell them, Ivarsson.
I'll go with them, but not until I've seen my son.
Thank you, my boy.
Very decent of you.
They don't look happy to see us.
That hunter stirred them up.
I don't see Donald amongst them.
Thank you, Sir.
Donald, Donald Ross.
Where is he? Can you tell us?
Ask him about Donald.
Is it true you are Donald's father?
Good heavens, you speak English!
Donald taught me.
He lives with us since he came to our land.
This is my father.
I'm grateful to you for looking after my son.
Where is he now?
He wants us to go in the house.
We cannot talk here.
Oh, very well. Thank you.
So, what do you mean, they took Donald away?
Who took him?
The Godi's men.
They came with weapons.
The Godi's their high priest.
It was because of the hunter.
He rode down from the mountain, shouting of invaders.
- It was that fellow on the horse.
- Yes.
When The Godi heard, he sounded the long horn.
The long horn is their call to battle.
Battle? What battle?
What has this to do with Donald?
When it was told that one of the invaders was Donald's father,
The Godi said Donald was a spy who came here to betray us to the enemy.
- Surely you don't believe that.
- We don't.
Because we know Donald.
There were many that did believe because there was an omen in the sky.
Omen?
Like a whale, but bigger many times.
My dear girl, that's easily explained.
What the people saw was my airship.
You see, it's like...
It...
It's like one of your boats.
Only it sails in the air.
If I could just talk to this Godi,
I could explain everything.
We're to be taken before the council.
Erik's a member.
You'll get your chance to be heard.
That girl, she speaks better English than Oomiak.
She's prettier too.
If she learned it from Donald, he must have spent a lot of time in her company.
Can you blame him?
I can't say I do, no.
This is like an archaeologist's dream.
To go back in history and walk the earth as it was ten centuries ago.
I suggest you forget the past and start thinking about the future, which from the look of things,
I'd say is not very promising.
The clothes, the weapons, each one of them could be a museum piece.
That's what I don't like.
Those museum pieces.
Look at that.
A Viking longship, exactly the way they were built 1,000 years ago.
Poor fellow.
And it's all my fault.
The temple, that's where we're gonna meet the council.
Ah. Good.
"Go straight to the top," I always say.
Odin, Thor and Freyja.
The greatest of all the Viking gods.
I hope they're on our side.
We may need all the help we can get.
A Viking council.
Straight out of a history book.
There's the girl's father.
He seems a sensible old fellow.
(IVARSSON) They probably call the one with the staff "The Lawspeaker".
They all look reasonable enough.
They might be my board of directors if it weren't for their outlandish costumes.
He said, "Bring out the other prisoner."
- Donald!
- Father!
That's my son!
I've been looking for you.
I thought you might.
It's my son.
- John Ivarsson.
- (IVARSSON) Donald.
- How do you do?
- He's keen on the past. Archaeology.
Sorry about all this.
It's a bit sticky here, I'm afraid.
He says that when I came to this land,
I gave my oath that I came alone and in peace.
But now come others, and with them, an evil omen in the sky
- that cannot be ignored.
- That's my confounded airship.
Let them speak before they are judged.
That is precisely what I wanted to do.
- Father.
- I'll handle this.
You just translate for me.
- What do they call this island?
- Astragard. But, Father...
Shh, shh.
Honoured council of Astragard,
I come to your beautiful country as a friend...
...in peace,
- (SPEAKS IN OLD NORSE)
(ANTHONY) seeking only my son, who was lost to me.
The Godi.
He's telling them not to listen to our lies.
It's obvious that we're barbarians who covet their sacred lands.
And we must be condemned at once.
And without a hearing.
Now look here, I thought
I explained to you...
It is no longer a matter for the council, for the gods have spoken.
If these men are spared, more will come in armed hordes to pillage and profane our sacred land.
There can be but one penalty for the invaders: Death.
(CROWD CHANTING
IN OLD NORSE)
Quite a sendoff.
Full Viking honour.
All very authentic.
Very final.
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Nonsense, my boy.
Donald.
(DONALD) Freyja.
We're in your debt, young lady.
Here they come.
And pull.
The shore. It's our only chance.
You stay here. I will draw them away.
- No, you won't. It's too dangerous.
- He's right, my dear.
It's you they're after, not me.
There is a hunter's cave. Up there.
With food and clothing.
I'll be back when it's safe.
Freyja.
Here they come.
- I think she's done it. Good girl.
- I should never have let her go.
- If they catch her...
- Don't worry, my boy.
- She knows what she's doing.
- Let's find that cave.
Hello.
Oomiak! My dear old friend!
I'm so glad to see you!
- We all are.
- We thought we'd lost you.
You can't kill Oomiak. I hide in water.
Swim like white bear.
Good, good, but let's go.
- What now?
- There's still nothing.
Oh, Ivarsson's up above, scouting around.
Right.
- Morning, Father.
- Hmm? Morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Wretchedly.
You must be a bit done in yourself.
I'm worried about Freyja.
So am I, my boy. So am I.
Well, I've made a mess of it, haven't I?
Of what?
The whole miserable thing, all this nightmare we're living in.
It's all my fault. Every bit of it.
Your fault? Why?
I'm the one who ran off chasing rainbows.
- You're not responsible for that.
- I am.
Right from the beginning.
I was always trying to shape you into my mould.
Bullying, badgering, never letting up.
If I hadn't driven you away, none of this would've happened.
Father, you didn't drive me.
Donald, I rode an airship across the top of the world to tell you this.
If we get out of this, you can do anything you want to do.
You'll be free of me, I promise you.
I don't want to be free of you.
I never did.
I came here looking for adventure.
And I certainly found that.
But I don't belong here.
Now, when we get out of this, and we will, I'm coming home with you.
I want to share in your work and your responsibilities.
If you'll let me.
If I'll let you?
You won't regret it.
I'll see to that.
- (FREYJA) Donald?
- Freyja!
He was quite worried about you.
I went back to the farm.
It'll be just as we arranged.
Father will give us dogs and a sled.
What had you arranged?
For some time, Freyja and I had been planning to leave the island.
We hope to reach Fort Conger.
The two of you, together?
You think I'd leave her behind?
Not if you're your father's son, no.
Boats, they come.
What do we do now?
There's not much cover, but we can get to the top without being seen.
That settles it.
We can't stay here. Those hounds would find us in no time.
Look, The Godi's joined us.
Bloodthirsty pounder.
Come on, everybody. Up we go.
They go. They go!
- (DONALD) They've given up!
- Thank heavens for that.
Look out, Father!
Clumsy of me.
Now the wolves are after us again.
Afraid so, Father.
It's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.
- (ANTHONY) Nasty sort of place.
- Oomiak, go watch below.
- We need somewhere to hide.
- But where? They know this island.
- The Bay of Whales.
- Donald!
It's over there, to the south.
It's sacred, taboo.
The Vikings won't go near it.
That's it, then. Let's go!
No, Donald, please.
- The spirits.
- (DONALD) Freyja, believe me.
- What is it?
- The spirits are good spirits.
Didn't they protect your people when they first came here?
- Surely they'll protect us.
- (OOMIAK) They come. We go.
Freyja, trust me.
Come on up.
Oddly enough, they say this sulphur's good for the lungs.
Sir Anthony, this is hardly the time to rest.
I only hope we soon find that blasted Bay of Whales.
Come on.
My father.
Father!
Burning one minute, freezing the next.
A man could catch his death.
Well, that's what's so interesting about the Arctic. It's a contradiction.
- In my first expedition to Bathenland...
- Ivarsson, please. Stop!
What we need is a conference.
Conference? About what, Father?
If we find the Bay of Whales and if it's true The Godi won't follow us there, what do we do then?
We lie low.
Make our way across the mountains to Freyja's farm.
- We can't go back through that.
- No, no. We find iceboat. Float.
- Very good.
- (ANTHONY) Boat?
What's he talking about?
He wants to find a piece of pack ice and float around the mountain.
Preposterous.
Where the whales go to die.
All those great creatures from every sea, lying there, from the beginning of time.
Just look at all that whalebone.
Worth millions of pounds.
And heaven knows what price the ambergris would fetch.
All that doesn't matter now, does it, Father?
Freyja, don't be afraid.
Think of the saga.
Doesn't it tell how, long ago, it was the whales that led your people here?
Where they found peace and happiness, so there's nothing to fear.
Believe me.
We need iceboat.
How we get down there?
Yes, how?
Not down these cliffs, obviously.
There must be a way.
The Vikings found one.
Is it in the saga?
Does it tell how they came up?
With the help of the gods.
It is told that he came through the mouth of hell.
- That's not very explicit, I'm afraid.
- Wait a minute.
That volcano in Iceland, Mount Hekla.
The early Christians believed that was the entrance to hell.
- What?
- Entrance.
It's a wild thought. Come on.
- The crater of a dead volcano.
- Quiet.
You hear that? Down there, there's an underground river.
The river flows to the sea, which means there is a passage from the crater to the bay.
Ho, ho.
Come on.
Look, the water's running out.
- Come on.
- (ANTHONY) Where to?
Wherever the water went.
Look!
Do not worry.
I have sailed this way many times.
It's not this I'm worried about.
It's them.
Will they never give up?
I can't understand why the bowmen haven't been shooting.
They do not have to.
- They only wait to see us die.
- Freyja.
It's taught in the sagas that the bay is guarded by sea beasts.
We cannot escape.
- Killer whales.
- (ANTHONY) What do we do now?
Anything we can.
Here comes the other one.
Hold on, everybody!
The Hyperion!
And heaven be praised, our old friend the captain.
(ANTHONY) My compliments,
Captain. You keep an excellent table.
And you're an excellent shot.
You saved our lives.
- Thank you.
- An unexpected pleasure.
Since I landed two days ago,
I've been trying to save my own.
But getting out of here, that's going to be quite a problem.
- Isn't it, Captain?
- I have the solution.
My ship may be battered and torn, but the mind that conceived it, that still functions.
As you see, the ship has lost much gas, but it retains some buoyancy.
So if we reduce sufficiently the weight, then it will rise.
How would you reduce the weight?
Abandon the motors.
The propellers are broken anyway.
The gondola too.
Strip the ship of everything that weights it down.
What have we then?
- A free balloon.
- By Jove!
- It'd carry us across the bay.
- If we can reach the pack ice...
We shall go farther than that.
The prevailing wind is to the south.
If it holds, we should drift to Greenland.
When we reach the coast, we descend and proceed on foot to the nearest habitation.
Capt. Brieux, you are a very remarkable man.
I've always felt so.
- Sir Anthony.
- This is a bit much, isn't it?
Hardly the time for ceremonies.
Let's be off.
Please, Sir Anthony, this is a moment to be savoured.
Once more, we stand on the threshold of a great adventure.
To my Hyperion.
May she rise.
Like a phoenix from the ashes of despair.
And soar like Man's imagination to Greenland and beyond.
The Hyperion.
- Now, let's get going, shall we?
- (BRIEUX) Of course, Monsieur.
I will show you now the ingenious arrangements
I've made for our departure.
Perhaps you have observed that I've cut loose the gondola.
The ship is now attached to it by a single cable.
So also the motors and the tail.
This section, too, linked to the ship only by a cable.
When I slip these cables, the gondola, the motors and the tail detach themselves, and we rise.
Are you sure?
You will see.
Now, gentlemen, if you will assist me.
The gondola.
The motors and the tail.
When I say three, pull with all your force.
Right.
- Permission to proceed, Monsieur?
- What?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, proceed.
Very well.
One...
...two...
...three!
Well, Sir Anthony.
It worked perfectly.
Once again, Captain,
I underestimated you.
I'm turning in. I haven't had a good night's sleep since England.
- Sir Anthony.
- Hmm?
Take a look.
Campfires.
So they're still waiting for us.
It's a pity we'll have to disappoint them.
What is it?
You look frightened.
- A little.
- No, you mustn't be. It's all over.
We're safe now.
I know.
It is not that.
What, then?
It is the world beyond our mountains, your world.
Our world isn't really so different.
It's bigger, and everything moves faster.
We live by clocks and machines instead of tides and seasons.
You'll get used to it.
And be happy.
Because you'll be surrounded by people you love and who love you.
I wish my father could be with us.
I know.
But his home is Astragard.
His heart will always be here.
Mine is with you.
Ivarsson.
When does the first ship leave Greenland in the spring?
Usually, the beginning of April.
So with luck, we should be back in England in about six weeks.
I should not count on it, Monsieur.
The wind has changed.
We are drifting back to the land.
Well, can't something be done?
I cannot command the wind, Monsieur.
- We're rising.
- Got draft.
The wind against the cliffs.
What happens when we get to the top?
Everybody out. Quick.
It's true that the gods were angry, but it was The Godi who did wrong by leading the people to hatred and to violence.
I'm glad they recognise that.
The prisoners may go in peace on this condition, that they swear a sacred oath.
Never to reveal the existence of this sacred island.
That's fair enough.
To ensure that the oath be honoured for all time, we must demand one thing.
Well, go on. What is it?
That you leave a hostage here.
Your son.
I refuse to discuss it any further.
How could they imagine
I would leave you behind?
- Those are their terms!
- I will not permit it.
Without a hostage, none of us will leave.
- Blasted! Then I'll be the hostage.
- (IVARSSON) I don't think so.
As a matter of fact, everything's already been arranged.
And very satisfactorily for everybody, I think.
Are you sure it's what you want?
Are you sure you want to be left behind?
Yes, I'm sure.
This is a chance no archaeologist could turn down.
Not only to study the past, but to relive it. Here it all is.
Hidden behind mist for 1,000 years, and I haven't scratched the surface.
Besides, who says
I'm being left behind?
We archaeologists take a longer view.
Whole civilisations have vanished before, you know.
The day may come when this might be Man's last refuge.
Good luck.
Goodbye, my friends!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!

Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!

My Mama with her flowers
Papa, Papa
My Papa with his pipe
Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Hurry Grandma!
The train's coming!
Coming.
Here, this is your ticket to Nagasaki.
And this is your lunch.
Don't get mixed up, now.
I sure hope you'll be okay on your own, Mimiko.
Who, me?
I'll be fine.
Anyway, I've got school so there's no choice.
No.
I just can't go.
Grandpa's memorial service is important.
But I just can't leave you alone.
Oh, Grandma!
You're such a worry wart!
You have to get on!
Don't worry, I'll write a letter every day.
Okay?
There.
See you later!
Mimiko!
Make sure you write me every day!
Don't worry, I'll be fine!
See?
Hello, Mimiko.
Where's your Grandma?
She just left.
Um, I'd like some apples, onions and potatoes, please.
Sure.
That means you'll be all alone from tonight.
No problem!
I can do the cooking, cleaning and the wash!
What a good little girl.
Mimiko doesn't have a father or mother.
But she doesn't seem lonely!
Aren't you gonna get scared and cry, being alone at night?
I'll be just fine!
If I see a ghost, then...
Hi-yaah!
I'll beat him up and make him my servant!
You sure are full of energy, Mimi.
Here, this one s on the house.
Thank you!
What a good little girl.
In actual fact, it's she who takes care of Grandma.
Mimi, I hear you're on your own for a while.
That's no good.
What if a burglar gets in your house?
Oh, that'd be great!
I've never seen a burglar before!
You got me there!
Hey... that's weird.
It wasn't like this when I left.
Wonder if it's a burglar?!
Oh, boy.
Somebody was definitely here while I was out.
I'm sure this bucket was put away properly bef ore.
Oh, boy!!!
Wow, a cute stuffed panda!
Wow!
I'm positive you and I are gonna be friends!
Wow!
My very first visitor is a panda!
Go on in.
Wait here, and I'll get us some drinks!
Ups-a-daisy!
There you are.
What a cute way to drink!
Daddy!
Daddy!
I don't see anybody.
Oh, someone's here.
Hang on a second.
Come in!
Thank you, I will.
What a nice house.
The weather's nice too.
And the bamboo grove is especially nice.
I've come to see if my panda son is here.
I thought so!
So you're the panda's f ather!
Come in!
I've just made drinks!
Please don't trouble yourself.
I guess this seat really didn't like being sat upon.
I'm sure this seat will want you to sit on it!
Now this is a nice seat!
The kitchen is nice, too.
And the bamboo grove is especially nice!
Which reminds me...
I should say hello to your parents.
No need to do that.
Because I don't have a mom or dad!
What?!
You don't have a dad?!
That won't do!
But I'm just fine!
I can get along on my own!
No siree.
In order to raise children, there have to be parents.
Like you need a bamboo grove to grow bamboo shoots.
It'd probably be better to have them.
What a nice bamboo grove!
I know!
Why don't I become your father?
Pardon?!
It's hard for a father to become a mother!
But it's easy to become a father!
Nothing to it!
I'm already a dad.
So it'd be nothing for me to become a father!
I'd like even just one father!
Mr. Panda! Be my father!
And in turn, I'll be
Panny's mommy!
Okay?
Then the three of us will live here in this house!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!
That's nice of you.
Panny's always wanted a mom.
Daddy!
Yes?
Daddies wear a hat, you know!
And daddies read a newspaper in the room.
And they smoke a pipe.
Thank you...
You're very welcome!
And daddies...
Um, daddies...
Daddies give hugs, too...
Okay!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Yes, little girl.
That s weird, calling me
"little girl".
Call me "Mimiko".
Huh?
Mimiko.
Daddy.
Mommy.
What is it, Panny?
Mom's right here.
Isn't this nice.
It truly is.
And the bamboo grove is especially nice!
The bamboo grove...?
Oh, I see!
What a nice bamboo grove.
Yes, I'm coming.
Got one!
Mine, too!
Very nice!
Is it good?
This is so great!
It's the happiest day of my lif e!
Standing on your head when you're happy.
That's truly a fun thing to do.
"Dear Grandma. How are you?"
"I'm doing great."
"Because something really terrific happened."
"I got myself a daddy!"
"And I also got a baby."
"Right now Daddy's reading a picture book upside-down..."
"...while he eats some bamboo."
"Panny's fallen asleep."
"I'll have to get his bed ready."
"Well, I'd better get going."
"Being a mother is wonderful, and it keeps you so busy!"
"Take care."
"Bye, Grandma."
"Love from your Granddaughter,
Mimiko."
Panny!
Breakfast is almost ready, so don't go too far!
Get up, Daddy.
Hurry or you'll be late for work!
Work...?
Huh?
Eat up!
All right, then.
Ouch!
Here's your lunch, Dad.
And this is your lunch.
My lunch! My lunch!
Oh! Your hat, Dad!
Here!
Huh?
Language, math...
When you say "Dad has to go to work"...
...are you talking about me?
Sure!
Dads go to work every morning!
Daddy!
I wanna go to work, too!
Work! Work!
Dad's going to work...?
Work...?
That's right!
How could I have forgotten?!
Today's a day off!
I'm sure of it!
Yes, that's right!
It's always a day off!
So I don't have to go to work!
A day off!
Let's go! Let's go!
Let s go for a walk!
We can't!
I've gotta go to school.
No!
I wanna go to school, too!
Don't be like that, or
I'll spank your bottom.
I don't wanna be spanked.
Be a good boy.
See you later!
Bye! Have a good day!
Oh!
Panny, did you follow me?!
You can't come!
Get back home!
You've gotta be bigger to go to school.
You can't come!
Uh-oh!
School's about to start!
Oh, brother.
In that case...
Listen, Panny.
Act like a stuff ed animal.
I'll take you if you promise not to be naughty.
Okay.
I'm a stuff ed animal.
"And after a little while, another tiger appeared."
"The tiger said, I'll eat you up!"
"Language"
Mimi, your stuff ed panda sure is cute!
Yeah.
Let me hold it for a while.
No.
Stingy!
Just for a minute!
"I walk on four feet."
Please!
Mimiko!
Let me see!
No!
What did you bring a stuff ed animal for?!
I'm telling the teacher!
Ouch!
Mimiko!
Yes?
Stand up!
Mimiko, what are you hiding behind the book?
A stuff ed panda!
Isn't it cute?
What a well-made panda.
You shouldn't be bringing stuff ed animals to class!
Now, get rid of it!
But...
Put it in the shoe locker until school s out.
Understand?
Yes.
Okay, Panny.
Stay here and be quiet.
I'll come to get you as soon as school's out.
Okay, I'll be right here.
Don't be naughty!
I won't be naughty.
"Bread"
Oh, dear!
You didn't put it away properly!
Now all this bread has gone to waste!
Oh! What's a rice cake doing in here?
What?!!
A bear!
Class is over.
Huh?
Oh, no! That's Panny!
A bear! Catch it!
Mommy!
Mimi!
Did a bear come this way?!
Look, teacher!
I washed my panda off; isn't it nice and clean?!
No, not a panda! A bear!
A yellow bear!
Oh, it went that way.
"And of course, Grandma..."
"...when we got home,
I scrubbed him clean."
"Because he smelled like curry."
"He was a curry panda."
"Of course, I had to scold him."
"It sure is hard, having a small child."
"Take care now."
Where are you off to,
Mr. Policeman?
Hello.
I thought I'd go check in on Mimi.
Grandma isn't back yet, is she.
No, and I'm worried about
Mimi being on her own.
See you later.
Hello, Mimi.
Hello!
It's unlocked!
Hello!
We have a guest, so stay over there.
What was that?!
Dad and Panny.
"Dad"...?!
A pa... pa... pa... pa!
Yes?
Did you call for Papa?
Boy, what a rude policeman.
He was surprised that I have a dad!
Hurry and let's go f or a walk!
All right, let's go!
Ouch!
That's strange.
I'm sure there was a great big panda and a little one.
A panda and its child were here, right?!
Hello, Mr. Zookeeper.
It was definitely Papa panda and his family!
Hurry and catch them!
I've been so worried about them for the last few days...
. ever since they escaped from our zoo!
Yes, I've heard all about it in the paper and on TV.
But who would've thought they'd be in Mimi's house...!
I'm counting on you!
Wow! It's beautiful!
This air is delicious!
This pipe is delicious!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come and skip!
Oh, a skipping rope!
Come on!
Hey, pandas!
Must be the ones that escaped from the zoo!
I won't let you say bad things about my dad!
Even my dad's dumb!
That's the famous panda that escaped from the zoo!
Don't you have a TV at home?!
Whoever catches them will get a reward!
Daddy...
Hey, hurry and go tell the cops.
I ll guard them!
Daddy!
But I wanted to keep skipping.
No, stop!
Look out, Panny!
Panny!
Ow...
Neat-o!
I'm giving him back.
You're so strong, Panny!
Dad...?
What's a zoo?
It's a place we were in a long, long time ago.
But they didn't have a nice bamboo grove.
And you weren't there.
But when they come to take you back...
...they'll take Panny, too.
Oh, where did Panny get to?!
Panny!
Panny!
Panny!
Where are you?!
Panny!
Panny...!
Hello, Papa Panda.
Lovely day.
And I'm delighted to see you looking so well!
And I m delighted to see you so well, Mr. Zookeeper.
I'd like your cooperation in accompanying us...
...back to the zoo.
We have the car already.
Oh, my.
How kind of you.
Then you'll come back?!
No. Dad!
We've gotta look for Panny!
That's true.
You'll have to excuse me.
"Panny"...? The baby panda!
Oh, no!
Everyone look for the panda!
Panny!
Panny!
We've been looking and looking.
Where could he be?
Hey! He's over there!
Oh, no!
There's a floodgate ahead!
A what?!
We've gotta move!
Panny!
Daddy! Mommy!
Panny!
Mommy!
Hang on tight!
No use!
It's rusted and won't budge!
Panny!
Mommy!
No, don't!
Let me go!
You'll get killed, too!
Mimi! Hang on!
Daddy!
Coming!
Hurry, Dad!
I can't hold on!
It's all over!
Mimi...!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Oh! Isn't that nice!
"Dear Grandma.
How are you?"
"Dad and Panny have gone back to the zoo."
"PANDA GARDEN
ENTRANCE"
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
"Dad's very happy going to work."
"After all, Dads are supposed to go to work."
"Dad buys me presents with the money he makes."
"Anyway, I'm very happy, so don't worry."
Dad!
Welcome back!

"Dear Grandma.
How are you?"
"Dad, Panny and I are all doing very well!"
"That's because we met some terrific people!"
"Who do you think it was, Grandma?"
It's inside this house!
Seems like nobody's home.
No matter!
Let's hurry and take it back!
Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty!
IS ANYBOD Y HOME?!!
You'll make the tiger run away!
Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty!
Think it's okay, letting ourselves in?
I don't like the feel of this.
Mr. Tiger! Mr. Tiger!
Are you in there?
Nobody's here.
I'm sure he's here!
Let's look!
Ouch!
Boss!
Find him?
Take a look at this!
What're you doing?!
Get looking for him!
It's just that I've never seen one this small.
And there's a mid-sized one.
Huh?
And this big one!
Boss...
What now?
What kind of person would use this monstrous tooth brush?
Start looking, or I ll really get mad!
Now where could that tiger have gotten to?
Th-That seat...!
That seat!
What kind of person would have that monstrous seat?!
And that monstrous spoon!
That monstrous plate!
And what kind of thing would eat salad like this?!
Boss there's no doubt about it!
There's some kind of great big thing living here!
Something like a man-eating bear!
Maybe it even ate the tiger!
Huh?!
A... A footprint!
Even a man-eating bear's footprints aren't this big!
What is it?!
I don't see anything.
It was... it was.
This big!
Strange, I could've sworn
I saw it.
What?
T-tiny and r-round!
I don't see anybody.
Huh?
Over there!!
Welcome!
You guys are burglars, right?
This is great!
It's the first time I've ever seen a burglar!
Wow! Wow!
Burglars! Burglars!
How do you do?
I'm Papa Panda!
Too bad.
Just when I finally got to see real burglars...!
They must be very busy.
Mommy! Dinner!
Dinner!
Yes, I guess it's that time.
Let's eat!
Let's eat!
Let's eat!
Somebody ate it!
Somebody ate my curry!
Yeah, you're right.
I wonder if those burglars ate it?
I'll get you some more.
I'm sure those burglars must've been very hungry.
Just like me.
Someone used my towel and got it all dirty.
Someone broke my trumpet!
Somebody's sleeping in my bed.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Hey!
It's a tiger!
A baby tiger!
Oh...
This is my daddy.
This is my mommy.
Mine too! Mine too!
Great!
After the burglars, a tiger came to our house!
I'm Tiny!
I'm Panny!
Wow! Wow! Tiny! Tiny!
Wow! Wow! Panny! Panny!
This is good.
What a nice visitor!
Come on, let s all have dinner together!
More, please!
Wow!
Ready... settee... here we... come!
We can't get out!
They're sleeping side-by-side.
Oh.
Hey, Dad?
I wonder where that tiger came from?
Wonder if he has a mom?
I'll ask around in town, tomorrow.
Daddy!
Hi!
Dad! I'm going to run some errands.
I wanna go, too!
Hang on a minute.
I'm just going to stick this in the mailbox.
Stay off the tracks!
I will.
Me too!
Mommy!
Huh...?
Wonder where they went?
Panny!
Tiny!
Strange.
I wonder if they went on ahead?
Mimi!
Did you know the circus was in town?
The circus?
Yeah!
It came in last night, on the train!
Yeah, and there are lions and all kinds of animals!
Hey, you wanna go?
Is there a tiger in that circus?
I dunno.
Probably!
Come on, let's go!
Then maybe Tiny belongs to the circus...
Which means...
Well? Are you going, or what?
Sure, I'll go!
Oh, what a fix!
Where on earth could that tiger have gotten to?
We've turned the place upside-down.
And I had my fill of that house last night.
Gee, a circus!
Huh...?
A panda!
After it!
It's that panda!
Stop!!
Oh, no!
The panda's gonna get eaten by the tiger!
No way.
You children are naughty!
Come on, just a quick look!
Come on, just a little!
No, I said.
We're setting up.
Come back tomorrow and see.
And bring ticket money!
Not fair!
Mister!
Have you seen my panda
Panny?!
Panda?
Yeah! The panda and tiger are lost!
Tiny!
Help!
A panda's gone into the tiger's cage!
A panda has...?!
Hey, stop!
Get back here!
Come on...
That's a good girl, let go of that panda.
Come on...
Come on, pandas don't taste any good!
Please, let him out.
Please!
No, stop! Stop!
She's in danger!
Mommy!
Mommy!
This is my mommy!
This is my mommy!
Hello, you must be Tiny's mom.
I'm Mimiko, Panny's mom.
Great!
I'm so excited!
Hooray!
The tiger came back!
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!
How nice!
The burglars, and Tiny, and the circus folk were all nice.
Look! The boss gave us some tickets, to thank us.
Let's all go tomorrow.
Wow! Wow! A circus! A circus!
Tiny's gonna be in the show with his mom.
It's going to be very nice weather tomorrow.
Oh...
Huh...?
Hey, is it raining?
Hurry, Dad!
Right.
I don't like the rain
I don't like the rain.
I wonder if Tiny and the others are getting wet.
They'll be okay.
Rain is important; it makes living things stronger.
And it's especially good f or bamboo.
I don't like when it rains.
The circus will be cancelled.
Don't worry I'm sure it'll be nice out tomorrow.
Hey, let's have a snack.
A snack?
Here!
It's Tiny!
It's Tiny! It's Tiny!
"Dear Grandma."
"The storm still hasn't passed."
"The rain just pours down."
"Panny is very disappointed."
"I'm sure there's going to be a big flood."
"I wonder how Tiny and the others are."
"I'm very worried about them."
Mommy, I'm scared.
I'm right here.
Don't be afraid, go to sleep.
Is Tiny okay?
Sure!
Tiny's mom is very strong, after all.
I'm gonna give Tiny my cookie!
Wow, I'm sure he'll be surprised!
Now close your eyes.
Gee whiz!
Dad! Hurry and wake up!
Oh!
Dad, look!
Some fish!
Isn't this nice!
A nice flood.
And the bamboo is especially nice!
Dad!
Time for lunch!
Coming!
Here, help yourself.
Thank you.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Yes?
Since you're down there, get some jam from the kitchen.
Sure.
Tiny! Tiny!
The circus ball.
So the circus must be flooded, too.
Wha't could this be?
Tiny! Tiny!
Read it! Read it!
These are Tiny's footprints, but...
It says, "Help, help!"
Signed, Tiny.
So they're having trouble with all the water!
Dad! Let's save them!
Take this, Dad!
Here.
Got it.
And we're off!
Isn't it nice, Dad?!
Look, the town looks like an island!
Oh, it's Mimi!
Boss, where are Tiny and the others?
The animals were washed away by the water.
Oh, that's terrible!
So you guys took off without them?!
Well, uh...
We tried to get them onto the train.
But the water came suddenly...
...and only the people escaped.
Gee!
Hey, Mimi!
Hurry, Dad!
Poor Tiny and the others!
Over there!
Tiny! Tiny!
You're safe, now!
We re going to get you out!
We have food!
Just wait a bit longer!
Here!
My cookie! My cookie!
It s going to get a little noisy.
Come on out.
There you are.
This is fun!
Nice, Dad!
My turn, next!
There.
Here's some cabbage.
Carrots for Mr. Giraffe.
Ham!
Cookies for the horses!
I'm so excited!
Look, there's no water.
Huh?
We've gotta stop it, Dad!
This is incredible!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Even more incredible!
Boss, did you hear a train?
Huh? Impossible.
See? I told you.
Don't be stupid.
Huh?
There it is!!
Dad, isn't this nice?!
Huh?
Hurry! Hurry!
Stop! Please stop!
Hi-ya!
Hurry! Get a move on!
Snap, snap! Get going!
Mimi!
The brakes! The brakes!
I can't! I dunno which one's the brake!
We're gonna crash!
We're gonna crash!
Daddy, make us stop!
Please, Dad!
Dad!!
Who's there?
Oh, Mr. Mayor.
Sorry about the racket.
You're the greatest, Dad!
"And so, Grandma..."
". The people in town and from the circus were very happy."
"And we're even happier than before, so don't worry."
"Well, I'd better go."
"Good-bye, Grandma."
"Your Granddaughter, Mimiko."
Let's have a chat
with the tiny giggling ants
Because we get along
and have fun laughing together!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda!
Go on, stjepan!
Go on, my boy!
Watch your brother.
The greatest soccer hero in all of yugoslavia.
You watch, you learn!
I'm trying, papa.
Goal! Goal! Goal!
Aah!
Aww.
Watch this, Gus.
- Ohh!
- Andy! Andy!
Andy! Andy!
Are you all right?
Give me your hand, son.
See, mama?
Now we have two heroes.
One soccer hero and one deep-sea diver. Bah!
Andy. Oh, be a good boy.
Stay with butterfly collection, huh?
Ah, I give up.
I wish I never had to see a soccer ball again as long as I live.
Gus? Could you do that again?
Ready, Gus. Oich!
My father gets the paper from yugoslavia. I thought that was pretty funny.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks,
Debbie, but even if
I was yugoslavian,
I'd have trouble laughing these days.
But a mule that kicks
100-yard soccer goals is kinda terrific, don't you think?
Yeah. Especially since we got nobody that can kick any kind of ball five yards.
This is monaghan, Mr. Cooper, against the packers.
That one cost us a 15-yard penalty, if I remember.
Yeah. That was the smallest loss we had all day.
Uh, what do you want to do about monaghan, Mr. Cooper?
Trade him to the packers.
They oughta love him.
He played a better game for them than he did for us.
Yes, sir.
Oh, uh, this is lindstrom, against the rams.
What was he doin'?
Wavin' to his girlfriend in the stands?
Well, I don't think so,
Mr. Cooper. Uh, lindstrom's married.
Mm.
That's probably why he's asking for more money.
What? He must be out of his head.
And that was the blow that did it.
Uh, this is zebrowski,
Mr. Cooper.
What do we do about zebrowski, Mr. Cooper?
- Try the falcons.
- Uh, they don't want him.
Uh, I don't think we got anybody they want.
Coach, we got nobody we want.
Uh, here's, uh, vanowen, Mr. Cooper.
He's the only bright spot in our entire offense.
Well, I was thinking, maybe if, uh, the other players promise not to congratulate so hard, we could coax him out of retirement?
- Debbie?
- Would you do me a favor?
I brought your aspirin,
Mr. Cooper.
Oh, good.
You've seen these film clips, haven't you?
Mr. Cooper, I saw all the games.
Mm-hmm.
All right, outside of Rob cargil at middle linebacker, what have we got?
Oh, we got a pretty good defense, Mr. Cooper.
Our boys have learned how to hit a few people.
If we can only teach 'em which team to hit-- men, we're comin' off a tough season, but this year's gonna be a whole new ball game.
Now, as we open training camp,
I'd like to introduce some of my new coaches-- some of my assistants.
Now, with the help of these men,
I'm gonna turn the California atoms into a solid ball team.
I see ya got the same old faces behind those batons.
Well, a lot of those atomettes have been with the organization a few years, Mr. Cooper.
It's pretty tough to just, you know, let 'em go.
Especially when they're gettin' so close to their pensions.
But listen to this.
I've been giving it a lot of thought, and I have come up with a clever new idea.
You're redecoratin' their wheelchairs.
No. No, no, no, listen.
Starting this fall, for all atomettes, if you're ten years married or got three kids, you're out. one thing, this band sounds better than the one last year.
It certainly does.
One thing I thought
I could count on was a decent halftime show...
That would pull in a few people.
When a man's relatives stop asking for free passes, he's in trouble.
But I got lots more talent for you to see, Mr. Cooper.
Wait'll you see this.
- Uh, Elizabeth?
- One, two! One, two!
Elizabeth?
Yeah?
Do some of those wonderful little flip-flops for Mr. Cooper.
Oh, sure, Mr. Barnsdale.
Very nice, Elizabeth.
Very nice.
That should bring in a few people, especially doctors.
I got some other great ideas, Mr. Cooper.
I saw this act on TV.
This elephant actually twirls a Baton with its trunk.
Now I figure we just dress him up like--
Joe, if I wanted an animal act,
I'd get that yugoslavian mule who kicks
100-yard soccer goals.
Oh, yeah. Debbie showed me that story. Even I'd pay to see that, I think.
Might be worth a look, if it's for real.
All it takes is a round-trip ticket to yugoslavia for me to find out.
No, no. Takes more than that.
Takes someone to loan me the money to buy you the ticket.
Lineman's calisthenics.
Blackboard drill.
Postgame films.
All right, I guess that about covers it for the coaches.
- Now, how many players we got here?
- None.
- None?
- They're not due till tomorrow.
Oh, well, then we'll just, uh-- all right, let's go to work, men.
Unbelievable.
Un-be-liev-able!
That's right, operator.
To thousand oaks, California.
The message reads,
"mule for real.
Never misses at 100 yards."
Uh, operator?
"Sometimes misses at 110."
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Well, what do you think,
Mr. Cooper?
It might just be an expensive bomb.
I'm not sure I'm that desperate.
Mr. Cooper?
I think we've got it.
Aah! Aah!
Wire Joe.
Sign that mule.
Do you want that card, Rob?
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mr. Cooper.
How would you like to baby-sit a yugoslavian mule and his trainer?
They signed!
Got his hoofprint right on the dotted line.
They signed the mule for the halftime show.
Oh, boy, the fans'll sure get a kick out of that.
But I gotta ask ya a favor, Debbie.
Since the trainer's yugoslavian, and you're yugoslavian-- well, my parents are-- close enough.
I'm puttin' you on detached duty and assigning you to this kid,
Andy, for a week or so...
To keep him from gettin' homesick.
Well, I haven't done any folk dancing, but I'll do my best to make him feel at home. Okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
What are you promisin', anyway?
Are we goin' together or not?
Well, it's only for a week or so.
Mr. Cooper's orders.
All incoming passengers from trans world airlines flight702, please claim your baggage at the street entrance.
- Andy?
- Yes, Andy.
- Debbie!
- Uh, Gus.
Uh, well, I'll see ya in a minute.
Come on. Let's go.
Tuck in that ball.
Follow through on that ball.
Way to go!
Introducing the greatest halftime act in all of professional football, direct from yugoslavia.
Hey, Rob.
Throw Andy a ball.
Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper.
Here you go, kid.
Welcome to the NFL.
You okay, kid?
O-oh, y-yes, sir.
M-my brother does it a-all the time.
Okay. Now, I want you to see that mule kick this ball.
Uh, Mr. Cooper?
Hmm?
- Gus has never kicked a ball like this before.
- Can't you get him to try?
For the kind of money
I laid out, I'm at least entitled to see him miss.
Go ahead, Andy.
Just try it.
Go on.
With your finger.
Hold it with your finger, kid.
There. Okay.
- Now, how do you get him to kick?
- I usually just yell, "oich."
Ah-ha-ha!
Right. If that's no fluke, you might have come up with a winner, Hank.
Yeah. A halftime show that'll let the atoms fans forget about the team.
Well, so far, in their opening exhibition game, the atoms haven't disappointed us a bit, folks.
Twenty seconds to go in the first half.
It's the Cleveland browns 27, the California atoms 0.
Manders in kick formation for Cleveland.
He stands on his own 30.
There's the snap. It's-- oh, it's over his head!
It's trickling back to the 25, the 20, the 15!
A scramble for the ball-- and Rob cargil has it for the atoms!
That's the way you do it!
That's the way.
Field goal team, field goal team.
Everyone, out of the way!
Uh-- way to go, big fella! Nice goin'!
Okay. Garcia, why aren't you in uniform?
Oh, that's right.
You're one of the coaches.
Okay, o'brien! O'brien!
Where's my placekicker?
He just went out to kick a field goal, coach.
Oh. Yeah. Good.
Thanks. Okay.
This will be the atoms' first score of the ball game.
Let's see. It's, uh, o'brien.
O'brien lines up for what should be an easy three points.
Now, folks, the moment you've all been waiting for.
You've read about them in the papers. Now you're going to see them in person.
Here they are, direct from yugoslavia, Andy...
And his miracle mule, Gus!
I'll say this, folks.
If Andy and his friend Gus...
Are half as good as their press notices, the fans here will get a lot more to cheer about than they did in that first half!
S-so many people.
I don't think I can go through with this.
What's he doin' to me?
It's the crowd, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's frightened.
When I get my hands on him,
I'll give him something to be frightened about.
Dah!
Can we help you, Mr. Cooper?
Yeah, get out there and do something.
The pyramid?
Yeah, the leaning tower, anything. Go on, go on!
All right, girls.
Form it up.
And, uh, one and two and one and two--
Mr. Cooper!
They're coming back!
Well, at least the crowd's laughing, Mr. Cooper.
They're gonna laugh me right into bankruptcy.
Now, remember, girls.
This one's for Mr. Cooper.
Yeah, for Mr. Cooper.
It's all right, Gus.
I feel better now. Thanks.
Ready, Gus?
Oich!
Ta-da!
Oh! Oh!
Great!
Well, there's a new wrinkle in atomland. Not the atoms.
They have the same old ones, and the old wrinkles lost to the browns 41 to zip tonight.
But that halftime show, with Andy and the mule Gus, that was something else again.
After a shaky start, the four-legged atom put three 100-yard kicks...
Straight through the uprights.
Hank Cooper may have found himself a real drawing card.
Question is, will it be enough to pull the ex-garbage king out of the dumps?
Financial, that is.
This sportscaster doesn't think so.
- Cigar, Charlie?
- Hank, whenever you offer me a cigar, old friends start to become cunning enemies.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!
How long we been playin' poker together?
Twenty years? Twenty-five?
Sure, that's how I got talked into the note.
Well, what
I'm gettin' at,
Charlie, is this.
You're a man who likes to take a chance, and
I think I got a deal for ya.
- Like what?
- Like, say, we make a bet.
Like, say, if I win,
I keep the club.
If I lose, you buy it-- at your price.
Well, now, that sounds interesting.
What's your wager?
I say... the atoms...
Win... half their ball games.
Wha-- seven games?
Th-that's more than they won in the last ten years put together.
- Not a bad bet, huh?
- Ye-- well, now wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What's the catch?
- No catch.
- What are you, some sort of a nut?
Charlie, i'm up the creek.
Flat. Zippo.
How 'bout it?
Is it a bet?
I'll tell you what,
Hank.
Huh?
I got a better bet for ya.
What's that?
Any team that can go from zero to seven wins...
Can go from zero to the super bowl.
The super bowl?
The bet was your idea, Hank.
If you wanna hang on to your team--
- the super bowl?
- I'll refinance you for one year.
You have to get to the super bowl and win it or you lose the team.
Ch-Charlie,
I wanna hang on to that team, but you're diggin' my grave.
Hank.
What are friends for?
Hi, Andy.
How do you like lukom's ranch?
Very much.
It reminds me of home.
Well, a letter from yugoslavia came to the office.
My family!
Maybe papa got the clipping.
Oh, boy, I bet they're proud of you.
Oh, could I have the stamp?
Sure.
Bad news?
Good news, about my brother, stjepan, and papa says that he played brilliantly against Brazil.
Stjepan kicked four goals and won the game single-handed.
That's great, but wh-- where does it mention you?
In the p.S.
"We received your newspaper clipping but could not read it...
"Because of the caviar that was spilled on it...
During stjepan's victory celebration."
Same old papa.
Isn't there something I could do?
How about writing you a cheerful letter?
Or maybe going out to dinner with me tonight?
Ohh. I made a date with Rob.
- Oh.
- You know, I haven't seen him very much lately, and I just don't know how
I could break it.
- Yeah. I understand.
- Otherwise I'd love to.
Yeah.
Gus! What is it?
I'll call the vet and cancel the date with Rob.
Oh, no, no. You go ahead.
I'll take care of it.
Don't be silly.
If Gus is sick,
I want to be here.
It's okay. You'll be okay.
I'd like to say
I cured him, but this mule's healthy as a horse.
I'll see you folks.
It was like a miracle that he recovered.
Yes.
You know, in my country, when a dinner date is canceled, it's canceled.
I think I like your customs.
And your miracles.
I don't believe it. That Debbie stood me up for two hours in front of a Chinese restaurant.
And I don't even like
Chinese food!
Hey, she called and asked me to give you a message, but
I didn't know where you'd gone.
Said something about
Gus the mule being sick and her taking care of him.
Gus the mule?
I got that Yugoslav comin' outta my ears.
Hello. Is Debbie there?
- No, she isn't.
- Where is she?
Out back with the mule?
No, she's out with Andy.
Left for the drive-in movie about an hour ago.
- Any message?
- Yeah, but I'll deliver it myself.
Debbie? Debbie, would you mind steppin' out?
Debbie, I know you're in there.
All right, if you won't come out, then
I'm comin' in. Aah.
I thought we had a da-- i-- sorry.
I am really sorry.
Oh, boy, am I sorry.
* oh, say, does that
* star-spangled banner
* yet wave
* o'er the land of the free
* and the home of the brave it's the home of the brave, all right. Can't be more than a handful of people here tonight.
Well, we saw what the fans thought of the mule.
Now I guess we're seeing what they think of the team.
This is Johnny unitas, and here's my good friend and cohort-- well, howdy there, football fans.
You, too, mother.
Pepper Allen here.
Just down on the field collecting some stats.
And it's just about kickoff time.
Time to welcome the old pepper pot into your living rooms...
For another season of great, great football on football night of the week.
Week after week,
I'll be with ya, step by step, name by name, game by game, and, of course, sittin' right here beside me, I'll have my old buddy Johnny unitas.
He'll be carryin' the ball right along with me, right, John? Right.
But don't you worry, fans.
The old pepper pot will be right here to fall on any fumbles.
Yeah, we're gonna be watchin' a very interesting team here tonight, folks,
'cause this atom ball club has nowhere to go but up!
I mean, it's a team that, during the entire exhibition season, they didn't win a single game!
Strike that!
They didn't score a single touchdown.
Strike that!
Couldn't buy a single point.
And if you can't go up from there, football fans, I don't know where you can go up from.
Right, Johnny?
Right.
Hey, have we got some interesting match-ups for you tonight.
Through the magic of pepper's profiles, i'm gonna give you an insight...
On some of the players who'll be makin' it happen right down there on the field.
Would you roll that film, please, back there?
Excuse me, pepper.
They're about to kick off.
Who? Oh!
The green bay packers, folks.
They're lining up.
And we're ready to go.
Roy really got his toe into that one. Right in and out of the end zone.
Yeah! The atoms get the first break of the ball game.
They don't have to run it back!
All right, offense!
Offense! Get in there and stick it to 'em!
Yeah, you don't have to be a
Johnny unitas to know that the only chance those atoms have...
Is to pass that ball, right, Johnny?
Right. Take it from the old pepper.
Now, if I were that quarterback, i-I'd come right out throwin'!
Throw, throw, throw!
Four! 68! Hut!
They came out throwing, all right.
They got thrown back for four yards, making it second and 14.
Get set!
53! 41! Hut!
Ellis is dropping back. Looks like they're taking your advice, pepper. They're gonna pass.
Oh, no!
Well, it's fourth down and 18.
I guess we better punt.
Hold it!
Uh, you don't want to punt, Mr. Cooper?
We're going for the field goal, coach.
From our own 12 yard line?
If o'brien turned around and kicked the other way, he couldn't make a field goal.
It's a field goal, coach.
Yeah, but wha-- uh-oh. A little confusion down there.
The mule has romped onto the field.
You're gonna do what?
Mr. Cooper's orders.
Someone throws me the ball, and I hold it.
Then Gus kicks it, and then we score a touchdown.
Not a touchdown, you yugoslavian midget.
A field goal. Three points?
If they're crazy enough to let us get away with it.
Now you're gonna have to get that mule off the field, Mr. Cooper, unless you wanna forfeit the game.
Oh, no, we don't want to forfeit the game, do we, Mr. Cooper?
We're not forfeiting anything.
The mule stays in, and he kicks.
There's no way they're gonna let that mule kick.
The referee is talking to someone on the field phone, pepper.
Johnny, please, stick with the money, John. Was the old pepper pot ever wrong?
Take it from me.
If the atoms think they're going to let that mule kick, it's pie in the sky, and I never lie!
Heh-heh, there's just no way!
How 'bout this way-- there's no way!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
I have been asked to read a bulletin.
According to the official rules of the national football league, rule 5, section 1, the game is to be played by two teams of 11 players each.
The rule book does not define the word "player."
Therefore, a player could be a man, a woman...
Or anyone a team chooses to represent them on the field.
And so, ladies and gentlemen, the mule "Gus" will be allowed to play.
And as you say, pepper,
"there's no way."
Oich!
Hank, that mule was a cheap trick.
What trick? You shoved an impossible bet up my armpit.
- I stuck you with a mule.
- Well, you'll never get away with it, Hank.
You wouldn't like to make a little bet on that, too, would you, Charlie?
Another beautiful evening here in Adams stadium and another capacity crowd.
The fans in these parts have gone bananas.
Four weeks into the season, and who is undefeated, and who's in a tie for first place in the western division?
Yes, sir, our own astounding California atoms.
Now let's go down to the field for the introductions.
At 229, number 50,
Fred stillwell. at 235, number 61,
Marvin schnall. at 250, number 57,
- Rob cargil. and weighing in at 1,374 pounds, number double zero,
Gus Petrovic. all right, men, this is another tough one.
I want you to get out there and stick it right to 'em.
This is a 40-man team, and I want a 40-man effort.
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!
Here comes the atoms' third-down play.
Ellis is back to pass.
Receivers are well-covered.
He looks, he looks-- oh, he's smothered.
It's another big loss, and listen to those atoms fans cheer!
Never heard a team cheered for losing ground before, but you're going to be hearing it all evening, folks,
'cause with fourth and 24 on their own nine yard line, here comes the reason.
Go get 'em, Gus!
Ready, Gus?
Oich! that's the way to go, Andy!
San Francisco's ball, good field position.
Remember, Tucker likes to throw the ball.
Yes, he's back to pass.
It looks. Like a screen and cargil is over fast to cover.
Kid. Kid!
Say somethin'.
I did it all for you, papa. here comes Gus trotting out on the field once again.
The question now is, who is going to hold for him?
I have seen everything.
I've seen many players carried off the field on stretchers, folks, but I've never seen anything like this.
Oich.
Cargil! Cargil!
Cargil!
You-- you're trying to ruin me.
I saw what happened!
It was a deliberate hit.
Mr. Cooper, I'm tellin' ya.
It was an accident.
Then it's a $1,000 accident, because that's what it's costin' ya.
One thousand dollars.
And a new suit!
And a box of cigars!
Don't worry.
Cal, they've won four in a row.
They're tied for first place!
Relax, will you?
What chance have they got to get to the super bowl anyway?
What chance?
With that four-legged George blanda kicking field goals, it is a definite possibility!
All right. So what we need is an edge.
You got somethin' in mind?
I'll work on it.
Spinner, crankcase, I've spent ten years of my life observing you two men.
I've seen you come in together and go out together.
I've seen you come back in together and go back out together, and I've seen you come back in-- yeah, yeah, warden.
We know.
You seen us come in together, and you seen us go back out together.
For the last time!
We're splittin' up.
Well, I'm delighted.
Then I wish you gentlemen both a happier and healthier tomorrow.
Thank you, warden.
Good luck.
Slayko, Lester slayko. Sports columnist for united press international, Mr. Lukom?
We thought there'd be a nice, warm human interest story...
About the ranch where
Gus the mule is staying.
And of course about the man who boards him.
Oh, good, good. Well, now, would you mind if I asked you a couple of questions?
Oh, good, good.
Now, I gather that Gus sleeps in a barn. Hmm?
His own stall?
With security,
I assume?
No security as yet.
Uh-huh.
Now, do you drive him to the stadium before the game?
Gordon horse vans.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, now, th-that's, uh, g-o-r-d-o-n?
Yeah.
Capital g-o-r--
Wow. That's the famous mule, huh?
Well, I heard a lot about ya, Andy-- oh, no, I'm Andy.
This is Gus.
Oh. Ye-- yah, well-- oh, well, pardon me. I'm not too good at names or faces.
Have you driven us before?
No, I just got out.
I mean, uh, to these parts.
Yeah. No.
Well, y-you do know the way to the stadium.
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
I'll get you there in plenty of time for the game.
Yeah. I know a shortcut.
It's gonna be all right.
Uh, wanna load him up?
Can't figure it out.
That shortcut disappeared.
Perhaps if we took the longcut it wouldn't use so much gasoline.
Oh, you're a worrier, kid.
By game time, you and I will be there watchin' that mule in action.
Uh, Mr. Cooper?
Mr. Lukom said they left about three hours ago.
By dog sled?
Well, maybe they got caught in a traffic jam.
Joe, they could have been here three hours ago if Gus had ridden in on Andy.
Yeah, you were right about the gas, but I was right about the mule.
It's game time, and we're watchin' him in action.
Did ya hear about what happened yesterday, Charlie?
Yeah, Hank.
It's a shame.
Mule missed the whole game, huh?
Yeah. Yeah!
It was the darndest thing!
Seems like somebody slipped in a phony driver.
Oh, Hank, deliberately?
Now, aren't you exaggerating just a little bit?
Maybe I am, Charlie, but I tell you this:
If it happens again, whoever did it is going to get his tail full of buckshot.
Men, this is a proud team.
This season, we've won four times together.
Now, last week, we went down together, but the Mark of a great team is whether they can come back together!
Yeah!
All right!
Now, first place is waitin' for us, men.
So this week, we're gonna get off the ground, and we're gonna go out there and we're gonna win together!
Are you with me?
Oich!
Let's count our blessings.
In a world sagging under the burden of war, energy crisis, bigotry, overpopulation, crime and inflation, it's a comfort to have Andy and Gus.
The mule is a winner!
He's something we need in our daily life.
If he hadn't just happened, we would have had to invent him.
For man needs hope...
And the assurance that somehow, some way, things are going to work out for the better-- that we're all going to be winners!
And it's taken a simple mule from yugoslavia...
To make this
American dream come true for the California atoms, who are now ten and one and tied for first place in the western division.
And how would you like to meet the young man who, with his mule, has helped bring the peoples of these two great countries,
America and yugoslavia, together?
Our candidates for goodwill ambassadors of the year:
Gus and his co-hero,
Andy Petrovic.
Andy, you've captured the heart and the imagination...
Of all America.
I feel very proud.
I would like to thank
Mr. Hank Cooper and everyone else who has helped me, and most of all,
I would like to thank Gus.
Andy, we have a surprise for you.
Through the magic of telstar, we are going to take you back to a small farm in yugoslavia, where a proud family is waiting to be reunited with you.
Come in, yugoslavia!
- Andy!
- Mama! Papa!
It must make you very proud to have a son who's a hero like Andy, Mr. Petrovic.
I don't understand.
What hero?
The mule kicks, and Andy holds the ball.
A finger is a hero?
You want to see a hero?
I'll show you a hero. Hah!
My brother, stjepan.
The greatest soccer player in all of Europe.
Fine, but this is a salute to Andy and-- and Gus.
Good. While you're saluting a finger, maybe also you should salute a hero!
Uh, well, thank you for the visit, Mr. and Mrs. Petrovic.
What soccer is to the rest of the world, football is to America.
And we can all pay tribute to these newly crowned American heroes tomorrow-- sunday-- now officially called "Gus day."
And as we cheer for Gus tomorrow, we'll be cheering...
For the mule in all of us.
A privilege to meet you, inspector Henderson.
May I ask the reason for the visit?
Just wanted to make sure your boys are on their toes, that's all.
We pembertons are never off them, sir.
We have Gus secured in his stable, all ready for his big night tonight.
Well, then, captain, perhaps you have an explanation for that, huh?
Huh? Huh?
Men!
Shh!
Drink up, Gus.
Today's your day. welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the biggest celebration of the year.
It looks like the whole city has turned out to honor its favorite two citizens.
I've never seen anything like it. This stadium is rocking with Gus fans!
And let me tell ya.
The spirit is catching, folks.
And I do mean catching.
Well, there are dignitaries from all over the state.
They've come here for the pre-game ceremony.
Let's see. There's the honorable mayor, Tom Lansing, and his lovely wife, Loretta, and representatives of boy and girl scouts...
And our own beauteous atomettes.
Let's see. That roar from the crowd can mean only one thing, folks. yes, here comes Andy and Gus in their proudest moment.
Come on, Gus.
Shape up.
Let's see. The mayor is now stepping forward to make the presentation.
Whoa! Help!
Someone, help!
- Gus!
- Wha-- help! Get me up, somebody!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
- Gus!
- Stop! Stop!
Whoa!
Come back, Gus!
Aah!
Well, we're set to go, folks.
The eagles have won the toss, and Gus will kick off...
And if Gus plays with half the spirit he's shown during the pregame ceremonies, watch out, eagles!
Oich!
Tsk. Shame to see ya drop to second place, Hank.
What happened to the mule?
Was he sick or what?
You know darn well what happened.
We ran his oats through a lab and made an interesting discovery.
How'd ya like to try a few of those oats,
Charlie?
Or don't ya drink before breakfast?
Well, all I know is I've got a friend who has problems, so I came here with an olive branch.
Whaddya got on it, arsenic?
Hank, I'm meeting the other offers for the team-- if you sell right now.
Your offer couldn't have been better timed, Charlie.
- Now I know you're sweatin'.
- Hank, you're playing with a cold deck.
Come on.
How about it?
Sorry, Charlie.
There's an old yugoslavian expression.
Never switch mules in the middle of a shave.
Well, the atoms really showed 'em how it's done here in buffalo today, folks.
It was Gus 30, the bills 27.
That moves the California club into a first-place tie with the rams, who lost today, and it sets up the really big one for next week, when the atoms play those same Los Angeles rams for the divisional title.
Incidentally, for wives and sweethearts who want to meet the team, the atoms' plane will arrive at 10:30 tonight in Los Angeles.
How are you?
Oich!
Two things happened to Rob cargil, the atoms' star linebacker today:
He went to the hospital, and he went to the Michigan mammoths.
Too late to help 'em much this year, even if they make it to the super bowl, unless you make tackles from a wheelchair.
The rumor is that Rob was the third side of one of those eternal triangles, and there's been bad blood between him and Andy Petrovic all season.
As for Andy, he hasn't got a problem in the world these days, as he and Gus lead the atoms into the divisional title game this sunday.
Yes, this is he speaking.
This is memorial hospital,
Mr. Petrovic.
Yes?
I've been instructed to call you by a miss Debbie kovacs.
Debbie?
Uh, what's happened to Debbie?
Well, there's been an accident, but she's in very good hands.
- Uh, who is this?
- I'm Dr. Ernest Goldman.
See, it was a two-car collision.
What a mess!
But you're not to worry.
Those were her very words.
She knows you got a crucial game to play today, and she wants you shouldn't miss it.
Uh, where is memorial hospital?
- Oh, you're not to come down here, sir.
- H-how do I find the hospital?
You take the Santa Ana freeway to the orange grove off-ramp.
Turn left at beach boulevard about four miles.
Then take a right.
Dr. Wylie. Dr. Wylie.
Call surgery.
Mr. Petrovic?
Dr. Goldman?
- Right this way, please.
- Dr. Danbry. Call x ray.
Now if you'll notice right here, the--
I couldn't expect a layman like you to be able to read this, but, uh, to the practiced eye, it's quite obvious.
Now, you see the pressure in the ventricular globule in the tertiary gland?
Well, that's causing an obstruction in the, uh, lumbar columbado region.
Ohh.
Uh, ahem, room's ready, doctor.
Thank you, doctor.
Dr. Deloo. Dr. Deloo.
Call inhalation therapy.
Oh, where's Debbie?
She's fine.
Right now, she needs an immediate blood transfusion.
What type blood you got?
Uh, i-I'm not sure.
Perfect. Just the kind she needs.
Here you are.
Change into these.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
- But, Dr. Goldman, i--
- I said I'll be right back.
What do you mean he isn't with ya?
We just brought the mule.
We thought Andy was with you.
You thought?
You thought?
I hired you guys for muscle.
If I wanted somebody to think, I'd have hired the supreme court!
Oh, how's Debbie?
I've been waiting here for the transfusion, but nobody's come in.
Patience, Patience, my boy. Everything's going along perfectly.
She sent you a message.
She said, "everything's going along perfectly.
Just knowing you're here eases the pain."
Oh, if only I could see her!
Will you relax,
Sonny boy?
You'll get your blood all bubbly, and that wouldn't do you any good for the transfusion.
Where are you taking those?
Well, I'm taking these to the transfusion room.
You see, the minute you're finished, you just slide off the table, slip into these and you're on your way to the game.
You keep your eye on
'im while I dump these.
What if somebody wants to come in?
Tell 'em ya got an extreme case of dementia praecox in there.
What kind of peacock?
You know-- oh, you mean the peacock's cuckoo?
Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray-- excuse me.
Uh, Mr. Cooper?
I just heard from Andy.
Where is he?
Well, there's been some kind of emergency.
He said he'd be here as soon as he gives
Debbie a transfusion.
Does that girl look like she needs a transfusion?
Oh, uh, no.
No, no, not at all.
You-- great shape!
Dr. Terussa. Call radiology.
Uh, excuse me.
You can't go in there.
- Pardon me.
- Oh, no. You see, we have a demented peacock in there.
- A what?
- Uh, uh, a, uh--- what about my transfusion?
I have to hurry. I'm playing a very important football game.
Football? Oh, sure, yeah.
I'll tell ya what. Why don't we bring the goalposts here, Gus?
Oh, no. No, i-I'm not Gus.
I'm Andy. You must believe me.
We do.
Yeah, we do. Yeah. Sure, you can be anybody you want here. Man o' war, rin tin tin.
How about dumbo, the flying elephant?
Hasn't got both oars in the water.
Mm-hmm.
It's fourth down, Mr. Cooper.
Guess we oughta punt, huh?
Excuse me.
I've checked every hospital in town, Mr. Cooper.
No sign of Andy.
Well, we're goin' for the field goal, anyway.
O'brien?
Get ready to go in there and hold for Gus.
Stretcher bearers, get ready to go in there for o'brien.
Then there's no
Debbie kovacs registered?
No, sir. I'm sorry.
There isn't.
Okay, get it!
I've heard of a one-man dog, but how could I wind up with a one-man mule?
Well, there's still a chance, Mr. Cooper.
There's a whole quarter left.
Ah, Debbie, we could have two weeks left, but without Andy holding for Gus, we're dead.
Dr. Carlisle. Dr. Carlisle.
Call 2411.
Shhh.
Oh, my. Well, folks, any dreams the atoms had of going to the super bowl...
Have vanished along with their little placekick holder, Andy.
Eighteen seconds to go.
Atoms' ball on their own 48.
Usually an automatic field goal for Gus, but he refuses to kick for anybody but Andy.
Gus is out there,
Mr. Cooper.
The question is, who are we gonna send out there with him?
All right, block that kick!
Block that kick! Block that kick! Block that kick!
Oich! Please, Gus,for Andy!
Andy!
My papa was right.
I'm some hero when-- when anybody can take my place.
Well, if this were my old aunt Hattie,
I'd call it the vapors.
I have a feeling if Andy walked through that door, the vapors would disappear.
Gus is probably more worried than any of us.
Not any more worried than I am.
Where does a yugoslavian kid go to drown his sorrows?
I think I know.
Twa flight 615 now departing.
Hey, Andy! Congratulations.
I was at the game today.
That was a great win.
Yeah, you're puttin' us right on top, Andy.
All right, Andy.
Right up there, huh?
Andy, where's Gus?
Never mind.
Can I have your autograph?
I mean, for my kid.
What kid? It's for you.
And get one for me, too, harv.
Andy, are you going back to New York?
No, b-back to yugoslavia.
But what about the play-offs and the super bowl?
Gus will do very well without me.
No, he won't.
Nor will an awful lot of other people.
Debbie, I'm sorry.
I didn't plan for it to happen this way.
It just happened.
I have to go.
Okay. You have to go, but can't we just talk for a minute?
All right, for just a minute.
Andy--
Debbie, before you start, I know now that my papa was right.
Your papa? Your papa?
My papa was right all along, Debbie.
I was never really a player.
If it weren't for Gus, i--
Andy, listen to me.
It isn't your papa.
It's you.
You've gotta be something in your own eyes...
Before you can be anything to anybody else.
Sure. In the meantime, my brother stjepan's the hero.
Hero? Who cares if you're a hero or not...
If you're not man enough to stay here and fight...
For something or somebody you care about?
Okay, go.
Go ahead. Run away.
You're just going to prove to everybody that that zero on your uniform is right.
To yugoslavia?
You told him off?
Couldn't you just stop him?
She did, Mr. Cooper.
Hi, kid.
That mule is nothin' without him, Debbie.
Nothin'!
Once he's on that plane-- where you been, huh?
Well, i-- never mind where you been.
I'll tell you where you're gonna be from now on!
Anywhere you say, Mr. Cooper.
I just want to say that
I'm sorry for all the trouble.
Uh-huh.
I want to apologize to you and-and to Debbie-- okay, okay, okay.
You just win the play-offs and the super bowl, and all is forgiven.
Right now, you and Gus are going into hidin'.
It's all arranged.
Yes, sir. Whatever you say.
But right now,
I've gotta see Debbie.
Naw, naw, naw, naw, naw.
Nothing doing.
Nobody's goin' near you till after the super bowl.
N-not even Debbie?
Not even nobody.
Yeah, well, Miami was tough.
It was real tough, but I, I had a gut feeling that we'd take 'em if we just, you know, ran right into their strength and, and passed right into that zone...
And swept right around those ends.
Uh, how about the 14 field goals by Gus?
Oh, yeah, well, they helped too.
Well, thank you, coach venner.
And good luck in the Superbowl, all you atoms.
Good game. Way to go.
Nice game.
Really good.
That's the way to do it, isn't it? Huh?
Good game, fellas.
Keep it up, guys.
Keep it up.
Hey, Hank, you're lookin' like a winner.
Gentlemen-- congratulations.
Lookin' like a winner.
Well, we'll know in two weeks, won't we, Charlie?
Oh, come on.
With Gus and Andy in there, heh, the mammoths don't stand a chance.
By the way, where is Andy?
I'd like to congratulate him too.
Oh, I'm sure you would, but you'd need a fast car.
Car?
Or plane.
Maybe even a boat.
Hank, I just want to congratulate him.
I'll tell you what.
I'll arrange a special interview with him...
Right after we win the super bowl.
Andy, are you all right?
No. It is my heart.
Your heart?
Yes. It is very lonely.
Mine too. Andy...
I really miss you.
Me too.
You would love it here.
When you climb to the top of the mountain, you can see the ocean.
Oh, it sounds beautiful.
Uh-huh.
Can see the ocean?
Can see the-- wait a minute. Sure!
Hank Cooper's got a cabin in the Malibu mountains in L.A.
Now, Cal, if I was a betting man--
What's going on here?
Oh, I am just so sorry that my boys aren't here to help me.
You see, I was trying to turn the bus around, and look what happened.
Could you lend me a hand, please?
Well, I don't know.
I think--
Gus can help. He's strong.
Not on your life.
Anything happens to him, it'll be my life.
Back on our farm when wagon is stuck, we use a lever.
I'll show you.
Well, we might as well.
We can't get by you anyway.
Excuse me, Gus.
We'll be on our way in just a minute.
Okay.
No, you're not lookin' at a mirror, Gus. That's just the world's greatest paint job.
Now, we're gonna play a little musical mule, so come on, out you go.
It's just the two of us, and we'd like twin double beds, please.
Yes, sir.
Room 319.
Thank you.
Oopsy-Daisy!
- Well, what's the matter?
- It's my contact lenses.
They're always dropping out, and they bounce all over the place.
Well, let me help.
I've got 20/20 vision.
Very kind of you.
Now, you have to be careful.
Yeah.
Try over there.
Found it.
Huh?
Where?
I don't see it.
Oh, you oughta have your eyes checked.
You need these worse than I do.
You've been very helpful.
Press three.
You know, this is crazy, spinner.
We shouldn't have brought, uh, you-know-who here.
We should have gone right to Mexico.
With the most famous mule in the country? Now, suppose the cops would've caught us?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Hey, I wonder if that
Cooper and company found out they got the wrong mule yet.
Well, how would I know?
The whole thing went off without a hitch.
Now, will you get some sleep?
Tomorrow, right after the game, we gotta get outta here.
Is that you, spinner?
What?
Somebody just crawled in bed with me.
Well, I guess he had to sleep somewhere.
Yeah, but why with me?
Well, how should I know?
Maybe you remind him of his mother.
Now go to sleep.
Hmm.
Hey!
Night.
How'd he sleep last night?
Never better, Mr. Cooper.
But you know something?
He looks like he's put on a few pounds, almost overnight.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, he can look like a whale...
As long as he doesn't go out there and kick like one.
Wanna order of two glasses of orange juice, two orders of toast-- one whole wheat, one rye-- an order of scrambled eggs and bacon, an order of, uh, eggs over with sausage.
Oh, uh, you got any oatmeal?
Well, send up a bucket.
Raw.
Same to you.
Yes, sir.
Here we are, folks.
The old pepper pot, pepper Allan and his favorite sidekick,
Johnny unitas.
We're here in the city of the angels on a rainy super bowl sunday.
Game after game, week after week, the struggle, the anguish, the heartbreak of the whole season...
Has unfolded before your eyes.
And I've brought you some great ones, haven't I?
You bet I have.
I've given you the highlights, the insights and even the hindsights, but the story of the year has got to be this amazing
California atoms team...
And their miracle mule, Gus.
They've gone from the bottom of the pile to winners by a mile.
And now what are they gonna do to those
Michigan mammoths, Johnny?
I'll tell you what they're gonna do.
As sure as there's clouds in the sky and rain in your eye, it's money in the bank for the atoms.
They may be short-changed today, pepper.
The sun's coming out.
Well, sun or no sun, folks, a muddy field means turnover time, and let me tell you what turnover means to those atoms.
They've lived by the turnover all year long, and the question is, will they live or die by the turnover today?
While you're working on the answer, pepper, we've got some guests from overseas in the booth, and we'd better introduce them before their visas run out.
You bet we have, Johnny.
Flown in all the way from yugoslavia-- at no small expense to our network-- mama and papa Petrovic.
It must be a thrill for you to be here this afternoon to see your son Andy perform.
Andy good boy.
Good farmer.
Goats and pigs not the same since he left.
Mr. Petrovic, there may be panic in the pig pen, but we're talkin' about a great American hero.
Oh, the finger, yeah.
Papa, maybe Andy is a hero.
A man who holds the ball for a mule to kick?
We'll see.
We'll all see.
Yes, indeed, folks,
'cause here they come.
Both teams out on the rain-soaked field, and the dream game...
That 100 million fanatic fans have been waiting for is about to happen...
And old pepper is gonna bring it to ya right into your living room.
And here's a little scoop for you right from the pepper pot.
Rob cargil, the ex-atom meat grinder, is suited up and sitting on the Michigan bench, splints and all, ready if needed.
Let me tell ya, folks, right now he's the meanest machine you've ever seen.
Well, here comes the kickoff.
Are you ready, Gus?
Oich!
What happened?
Huh?
Gus, what's the matter?
Gus? Are you Gus?
You're not Gus!
Hey, that mule's gone ape.
What's the matter with him?
Whatever it is, stay away from his hind legs...
Unless you wanna wind up lookin' like that TV set.
Hey!
What's goin' on out there?
Where'd that white spot come from?
Something must've rubbed off, Mr. Cooper.
You know,
I got a sister-in-law who had a nose job.
Maybe we've got a-- a mule with a paint job.
No, just kidding.
That's not even Gus, you nincompoop!
Hey!
It's a fraud!
The old shell game, folks.
Hank Cooper and the missing mule have made jackasses of all of you.
I tried to tell you.
Didn't I, Johnny?
You bet I did.
The bubble had to burst sometime, and the bubble burst right in the first half.
So far, this super bowl has been a laugher for the mammoths, but I don't seem to hear any laughin', do you, Johnny?
No, I don't either.
Especially from the atoms.
'Cause take it from us, folks, there's no more Gus.
Mr. Cooper, they've spotted Gus.
Where is he?
Somewhere near topanga canyon, but they lost him.
Let's go, kid.
But where?
How do I know?
We're gonna find him, and if we don't, nobody better find the two of us.
See anything,
Mr. Cooper?
Same thing you do, kid.
Nothing.
That half-time must be almost over.
Uh, excuse me.
Listen, no mule is gonna outsmart us.
Yeah? Well, he's doing a pretty good job so far.
This place is as good as any corral.
Now, you round him up, and I'll lasso him.
You think you can handle that?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I used to be a bus boy on a dude ranch.
I got him!
Spinner! I got him!
I got him!
Hi.
Oh... oh.
Hello.
Am I in your way?
Whooaahh!
I got him.
Oh. I got him.
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa there.
Whoa. Whoa.
Steady now, Gus.
Hold it. Whoa.
Let go of me!
Ohhh!
Who was that?
Oh, yes.
We package it all ourselves.
That's how we built our reputation for having the freshest meat in town.
Hey! Hey!
Freshest meat!
All right, all right, all right.
Look, crankcase, you go have a look over there, huh?
Yeah.
Hey.
Huh?
And try and be a little more discreet.
Get him! Get him!
Ohhh.
Ohhh! Help!
Aaah! Whoa!
- Ohhh.
- Hey, mom, look at that!
What are you doing in there, huh?
Hey, don't-- don't do that!
All right, quit foolin' around.
Huh?
Stay close.
Which-- which way did he go?
I don't know, but
I'll tell you one thing. I'd settle for goin' back to jail.
Not with 25 g's at stake.
Now, you go over there.
I'm goin' up here for a better look.
Oh, wait a minute.
Here.
Get me a bottle of aspirin.
I got an awful headache.
Aaaaah! No!
Whoa.
Whoa, Gus. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Wh-- whoa. Whoa!
Oh.
Spinner, I got him!
Tsk. Really!
Oh, my goodness!
I'm a mess!
Give him room!
Get out of the way!
Give him some room!
Somebody stop him! No!
Sorry, Mr. Cooper.
There's no sign of him at all.
And it's one hour till doomsday.
Not yet!
Look down there!
It's Gus!
Another of pepper's predictions was right again, folks.
Safe and sound,
Gus has been found!
And the mule-nappers are on their way to the rock pile.
Ah, but before you start cheerin' for the atoms, remember it's a long way from topanga canyon to the coliseum.
And there is no way-- no way they can get him here on time.
Uh, pepper, there's one way.
Johnny, there is no way.
Unless-- unless they bring him in by helicopter, and if they listen to the old pepper pot, that's exactly what they'll do.
Oich!
Oich!
Unbelievable!
Inconceivable!
What a comeback, folks!
Five consecutive field goals!
The atoms have been stickin' and the mule has been kickin'.
And with two minutes to play, don't go away!
The old pepper pot...
Wouldn't miss bringin' this to you for a-- for-- well, at last, it's nice to come into your livin' room, everybody.
If you think you've seen a miracle on the field, we've been treated to an even bigger one here in the booth.
The old pepper head's ground to a halt.
But I think I know what he'd like to say.
Week after week, game after game, play after play, have I ever been wrong?
And now, with all my insight, hindsight and foresight, let me tell you, mother, this is the greatest comeback in the history of American sports.
Win or lose, the atoms have made it a game.
And I told you all along, and I'm telling you again, the mule is the team and the team's on the beam.
Yes, sirree.
And how have the atoms been doing it, folks?
No muss, no fuss, just Gus.
Right, pepper?
Right.
There! Five three!
One, twenty-nine, and... hut!
Well, it looks as if you've won yourself a ball team, Charlie.
And the first thing you're gonna do is to get that mule's hoofprint on a contract.
Better work on our goal line defense.
Prescott.
With ten seconds left, what's the difference if they win by one or a hundred?
Well, losing by one point isn't bad at all, Mr. Cooper.
It's something to be proud of.
Don't you understand?
I've lost the team.
Well, it's something for the next owner to be proud of.
Andy, you and Gus have come so close,
I'm sure your papa realizes.
He must be proud of you.
It isn't papa
I'm worried about.
To him I'll always be a half a hero.
It's Mr. Cooper.
I'm sorry we couldn't win it for him.
Well, here they go,
Mr. Cooper.
Oh, good idea.
I can't watch either.
I'm praying.
Oh. Well, if you're praying for rain, we've had plenty of that already.
I'm praying for a-- fumble! it's a fumble!
Andy, you and Gus get out there and do your stuff!
But we have to kick from the end zone,
Mr. Cooper, and Gus isn't too accurate over a hundred yards.
Kid, kid, just relax.
Be calm.
Don't think about a thing.
Forget that an old man's life or death depends upon this kick, and get out there!
Go, Andy!
Go, Gus!
Holy Toledo!
Look who's comin' in!
While you're down there, say a little prayer, runt,
'cause when the ball's snapped,
I'm turning that spot into a yugoslavian burial ground.
We've gone this far, Gus.
Now we're going all the way.
Oich! Gus!
Go, Andy!
He fumbled.
Oh, no!
Get it!
He's got it!
Go, Andy!
Yea!
This is my boy!
Is real hero, huh?
Well, Gus, your other half stole the thunder, but don't let it get you down.
Even the best of them slip once in a while.
Slip, Gus?
Come on.
Death ends a life...
...but it does not end a relationship...
...which struggles on in the surviv or's mind...
...toward some resolution...
...which it may never find.
Northeast Airlines announces the arrival of flight number four.
Yellow Bird service from Miami and Fort Lauderdale...
...now arriving at Gate Number 9.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Tell me where I can get a wheelchair?
- Yes, at the ramp.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Attention please.
Flight number 10 from Los Angeles...
Hello, Dad.
Well, Gene, as I live and breathe.
This is a surprise.
- I wrote you I'd be here.
- You did?
Oh, well, my mind is a sieve.
- Hello, Mother.
- Northeast Airlines announces...
I got a wheelchair for you.
Save you the walk.
Oh, my precious.
What would we do without you?
You look great.
I'm all right, but listen to him.
I couldn't get him to see a doctor there.
I told you I wasn't gonna let those bozos charge me tourist prices.
That wind down there never stops blowing.
- He's had me sick with worry.
- Now, now, Mother.
I've taken pretty good care of myself for 80 years.
- I know, but...
- Take care of your mother.
I'll see you at the baggage section.
- Bags won't be there yet, Dad.
- I want to be there.
Don't want anyone making off with our luggage.
Where's the car parked?
- It's in the lot.
- Is that the Buick?
I wrote you from California.
I bought a Mustang.
- I thought you like Buicks.
- No, you like Buicks.
Things to worry about.
Nobody's gonna walk off with your bags.
I've travelled a good deal more than you have, old man.
You keep an eye on your luggage or some savage will walk off with it.
You can't change him, lovey.
There's no use trying.
He's a remarkable man.
Look how he walks.
Like a brigadier general.
He may not always remember where he's going...
...but he always goes there with a firm step.
Who took this picture of you?
A friend.
I guess it's supposed to be artistic.
It looks weak.
Oh, now, lovey, don't go on like that.
It's a very nice picture.
No, I like a picture of a man to look at me straight in the eye.
I suppose we should stop and shop.
There'll be nothing in the house to eat.
- I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
- Hooray for our son.
Can you spare the time?
- Mother, he said he would.
- I wanna tell you about California.
- Yes. We haven't heard anything.
- Gene, take the next to the left.
I'll bet Tom didn't bring that battery for the car.
- Did you write him?
- Yes.
And the next right, Gene.
You don't mind my giving you directions, do you?
- Well, he did bring it back.
- Good.
Can't count on anyone these days.
- Where's your mother?
- She's in her garden.
What?
She's walking in her garden.
You know, Gene,
I don't mean to criticise...
...but you're mumbling a great deal.
I have great difficulty understanding you.
You need a hearing aid, Dad.
Oh, I can hear perfectly well if people would only enunciate.
"Mr. Garrison, if you would only enunciate."
Professor Aurelio at night school.
Where did you say your mother was?
In her garden.
You know, Gene...
...the strain has been awful.
- She looks well.
- I know.
You never know when she'll have another one of those damned seizures.
It's been rough, I know.
Well, we'll manage.
She's a good soldier.
But, you know, she eats too fast.
The doctor said she must slow down.
Well...
...we got all of your letters from California, Gene.
- I have them here someplace...
- Sorry I didn't manage every Sunday.
We do look forward to your letters, old man.
There isn't much else for us these days.
But this girl, this woman you mentioned several times...
I'll tell you all about California at dinnertime, okay?
- You seem to see a great deal of her.
- Well, I do.
Carol's been dead, let's see now...
It's over a year.
There's no reason why you shouldn't go out with another woman.
No.
I was in California many years ago.
It's a beautiful place.
- I can understand your enthusiasm.
- I like it a lot.
But, Gene...
...if you were to go out there to live...
...it would kill your mother.
God, you're her whole life.
- Dad, no.
- Yes, you are.
Oh, she's fond of your sister, but you are her life.
You think I haven't known that all these years?
- Dad, I know we're very close, but...
- Gene.
Father.
Just remember what I've said.
Well, let's get the rest of the luggage.
Here she is.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mary.
- Mr. Garrison.
- We missed you.
We had a girl down in Florida with no sense of humour.
- Couldn't get a rise out of her.
- We'll have some jokes then.
- Dry martini?
- You twist my arm.
Six-to-one.
What's your pleasure,
Gene, Dubonnet?
- I'll have a martini.
- But not six to one.
- The same, please.
- Well.
- Mother?
- No, nothing.
My joints would be as stiff as a board.
- Did you say you'd be stiff?
- Oh, my joints. My joints.
We wouldn't want you stiff.
Did I ever show you this ring?
You've shown it to him a hundred times.
I never thought
I'd wear a diamond ring...
...but when T.J. Parks died,
I wanted something of his.
The last time I had it appraised, they told me it was worth 4000.
Whenever I go see a doctor,
I always turn it around.
I don't want him to think
I'm rolling in money.
It's his favourite occupation, getting that ring appraised.
That and telling the gruesome details of his life.
Now, wait a minute.
I can't have anyone in. Your father won't play bridge or do anything.
He just wants to watch Westerns on TV or tell the story of his life.
Well, people seem to be interested.
That story of your mother's funeral.
- I don't remember that.
- Don't get him started.
He keeps telling how he wouldn't allow his father to his mother's funeral.
- You suggesting I should've let him?
- I'm not saying...
He'd run out on us when we were kids.
Can you imagine telling everyone...
...how he shoved his father off the funeral coach?
I'd do it again.
I was 10 years old.
He hadn't been around to see us for over a year.
Four of us living together in that two-room tenement.
Suddenly, he showed up at the funeral...
...weeping, begging.
Drunk as usual.
I shoved him off.
I didn't see him until years later, when he was dying in Bellevue of drink.
- What looks good to you?
- I haven't finished yet.
I went down to see him, asked if he wanted anything.
He said he wanted an orange.
So I sent him in a half dozen oranges.
I would've sent more, except he was dying...
...and there was no point in just sending oranges to the nurses.
The next morning, he died.
Look at your menu, Father.
What looks good to you?
I don't feel like anything.
I have no appetite.
- This is the way it's been.
- Here we are.
Six-to-one.
Oh, damn it.
You always ask for lemon peel.
But twisted over it, not dumped into it.
It's all right. It's all right.
Well, to your smiling Irish eyes.
He hasn't changed a bit, has he?
I like to get a rise out of them.
If they kid with me,
I give them a good tip.
If not, straight 10 percent.
Now, what's the matter?
If you wanna make a fool of yourself, go ahead.
- It's lovely, dear.
- Thank you.
I don't know how he can stand listening to those Westerns hour after hour.
I think he always wanted to be a cowboy.
He won't listen to the things
I wanna hear.
Down in Florida, there was only one TV in the lounge...
...and he rode herd on it.
And then he'd go to sleep in three minutes.
Still, he's a remarkable man.
Good old Mom.
What a shame that children can't see their parents...
...when they're young and courting and in love.
Gene!
Come and watch this one.
It's a real shoot-'em-up.
I'll be down in a minute, Dad.
Now, tell me about California.
Well, I liked it a lot.
It was good for you to get away for a while...
...from your apartment and memories of Carol.
Mother...
...I told you about the woman that I met in California, Peggy.
The doctor with the children.
I'm thinking of marrying her.
Well, she sounds like a lovely woman.
And people would expect a man your age to marry again.
And she has her practice out there.
And children and their friends and their schools.
Well, there's still trains and planes.
And Alice comes home from Chicago once or twice a year with the children.
Your father and I can take care of each other.
He makes the beds...
...which is the only work
I'm not allowed to do...
...and I'll remember where he put his chequebook.
I'm sorry it's worked out like this.
We're fortunate to have had you so near us for so long.
Have you told your father?
No...
...but I think he's guessed from my letters.
He says if I went out there to live, it would kill you.
Why can't he say it would kill him?
Because he thinks it wouldn't hold you...
...or mean anything to you.
I'll talk to him.
- He'll make a dreadful scene but...
- No.
You've always done that for Alice and me.
I'll do it.
What?
- Where's your mother?
- She's upstairs. She's gone to bed.
Dad.
This is a good one.
This fellow can really handle a gun.
- Dad, I wanna talk to you about...
- Just a minute.
- I'm gonna go.
- Oh, so soon?
We see so little of you.
I'm up at least once a week.
Oh, I'm not complaining, but there never seems to be any time...
...and when you are here your mother does all the talking.
Well...
...all's lost, all's spent...
...when we our desires get without content.
'Tis better to be that which we destroy...
...then by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Well, we'll get a chance to talk, Dad.
Maybe you can come down into town in a couple of days and have lunch.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- That's a wonderful idea.
I'll call.
Can't tell you what a comfort it is knowing you're down in the city.
Don't know what we'd do without you, Gene.
- No hat or coat?
- No.
It's still chilly.
You should be careful.
You're coming up for your mother's birthday?
- Yes.
- Gonna be my party.
And Gene...
...remember what I said about California.
Good night, Dad.
Be careful. I noticed you were inclined to push it a little up there.
You make a full stop at the end of the driveway and then turn left.
Then there's a lot of traffic out...
Take the first left and then the second right.
Good night, old man.
Hello, Norma?
It's Gene.
Couple days ago.
Listen...
...would you like to come out for a drink?
Okay. Good.
I'll see you in about 10 minutes, all right?
Bye.
Just once.
Just once I'd like you to come see me and then after...
Afterwards, smile.
Thanks.
You feel guilty, that upsets me and the whole thing gives me the willies.
I'm sorry.
What are you feeling so guilty about now?
That you're gonna get married and you're here with me?
Oh, I don't know, I just...
...always feel like I'm using you.
I don't think of it as using.
Back when Carol was dying, when you first came running up those steps...
...I was pretty damn touched by the whole thing.
You make it sound great.
- Somewhere you must hate me.
- No.
- You're bad.
- Coming to you like this, l...
"Hello, are you gonna be in?
I wanna come over."
Still I get all like...
So...
...some other men go out on a binge.
You come to me.
Frankly, I like your way better.
- It's just...
- Friendlier.
I get so fed up with being treated like a child.
I mean, like an ungrateful child by a senile old man.
I sit there and watch television with him for hours while he sleeps.
Then when I'm going he says,
"We don't ever get to see you."
Why can't your sister do some of his babysitting?
She's in Chicago...
...and banished away.
I told you...
...for marrying a Jew.
I hate him.
And I hate hating him.
I hate what it does to me...
...because when I'm around him l...
Somehow...
...I shrink.
Well, you'll be going away soon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For some damn reason,
I feel guilty about leaving him.
Arguing with each other.
He was a big man in that city.
He was the mayor.
He was the president of the board of education...
...and a lot else.
Now they don't know he exists.
All his contemporaries are dead.
Who reads the bronze plaques on school buildings?
A forgotten man in an ungrateful city.
Now I'm gonna walk out on him too...
...and for some reason, that just depresses the hell out of me.
It's a lousy world, my friend.
Yeah.
Only you wanna set it all right.
Make it like in storybooks.
Love eternal beyond death.
Grandma and Grandpa with the kiddies gathered around them.
And sex always an expression of abiding love.
Grow up, huh?
No.
Don't change.
Hello.
What is it, Dad?
Oh, Jesus.
I'll be right up there.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Garrison's room, please.
- Room 507.
- Thank you.
Mr. Beauhart. Mr. Beauhart please come to admitting office.
I'm her son.
- Is Dr. Mayberry around?
- No, but he saw her an hour ago.
He seems to think everything is going just as well as can be expected.
Thank you.
Miss Chilton.
Miss Chilton, number 2256.
Dad. Dad.
Oh, Gene.
Am I glad to see you.
- You've seen your mother?
- Yes, I have.
That doesn't sound any better, Dad.
I've had a shot.
After your mother got settled here...
...I went down to the doctor's office and had a shot.
I just don't understand it.
I was getting breakfast...
You know, I've been getting breakfast.
- when suddenly,
I heard your mother scream.
"Tom! Tom!"
I went running up the stairs...
...and there she was, stretched out on the floor.
"Nitro, nitro," she whispered.
You know, we've got it all over the house.
Well, I gave her the nitro...
...and I called the doctor and the ambulance...
...and here we are.
She had such a good time in Florida.
Oh, she worried about my cough but she had a good time.
Dad, these things happen.
I suppose I could have seen more of her down there...
...but she only wanted to play bridge.
I met some very interesting people.
You know, I met this man came from Waterbury, Connecticut.
He used to know Helen Moffett.
I've told you about Helen Moffett, haven't I?
When I was a kid, when the clouds hung low and dark for me...
...my grandfather used to take me out there sometimes on Sundays.
A city slum kid in that beautiful country.
And Helen and l...
Oh, it never amounted to much.
We'd go to church, then we'd take a walk.
Sit in a hammock or under an apple tree.
I think she liked that.
But I didn't have any money, so I didn't get out there very often.
Her mother never liked me.
"That young man will end up the same way his father did."
And that scared her off.
This man from Florida,
I have his name here.
He said that Helen had never married.
She'd been in love as a kid...
...and then never married.
Dr. Wish. Dr. Wish, please come to Emergency.
Now, I would like to make a suggestion.
What's that, Dad?
If we move right along, we might just be able to make Rotary for dinner.
I've been away for three months.
They don't like that.
If you're absent too often, they drop you or fine you.
What about it?
I thought we'd just grab a bite here at the hospital.
Oh, I had lunch at the coffee shop downstairs and it's terrible.
We'll just say hello to the fellas and come back.
Your mother's sleeping now.
She'd want us to go.
Sure, Dad.
Dr. Robbins, please call 399.
I don't know what I'd do without you, old man.
- You've been here before, haven't you?
- Yes.
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello Sam.
Good to see you back. Good trip?
Fine. Except for those damn winds down there. Excuse my French, Sam.
You know my son Gene.
Reverend Pell.
- Yes.
- How are you?
Gene was a Marine.
You were a Marine, weren't you Sam?
- Oh, no, Navy.
- Well, same thing.
- Don't say that to a Marine.
- Gene saw the flag go up at lwo.
Dad, let's order a drink, shall we?
Oh, Sam, I've been wanting to talk to you.
This isn't the appropriate time...
...but some bozo has been crowding our pew at church.
I don't wanna seem unreasonable, but there's a whole church to sit in.
Well, we'll see what we can do.
Martini, George. Six-to-one.
- Dubonnet, Gene?
- Martini.
I hope you don't drink too many of those, Tom. Six to one.
My grandmother used to give me every morning before school...
...when I was knee-high to a grasshopper...
...a jigger of gin with garlic in it.
That was to keep away colds.
I wonder what the teachers thought.
I must have stunk to high heaven.
I don't want you to think
I'm running away...
...but I was on my way to the little boys' room. Catch up at dinner.
Go ahead.
We don't want an accident.
- You got a great dad there, Gene.
- Thank you.
Dr. Peggy Thayer, please.
If she wants to know who's calling, it's Gene Garrison from New York.
Hello, Peggy? How are you?
I'm sorry I didn't call earlier.
I'm okay.
Listen.
You know I picked up my mom and dad at the plane and took them home.
Well...
...yesterday my...
My mother had a heart attack.
I went up there last night, and...
No, I'm in the city now.
The hospital just called.
My mother died a few minutes ago.
I'm sorry, Gene. There was nothing that could be done.
She's been living on borrowed time for quite a while.
Your father's all right.
You know, Gene, he's been prepared for this for years.
It may, in many ways, be a relief.
He's taken wonderful care of her.
I know I'm touching on a difficult matter...
...but, as an old friend, he shouldn't be living in that house alone.
Do I have to look at all these?
It's the only way, Tom.
The best way is to let you just wander around and look at them.
The prices are all marked inside the caskets.
Nine hundred dollars. For the casket?
Well, that includes everything, Tom.
All our services...
...and one car for the mourners.
Other cars are extra.
We'll have your car.
We don't need any other.
If anybody else wants to come, let them use their own cars.
Oh, dear, Gene.
Two thousand dollars?
- What are these made of?
- They vary, Tom.
Steel, bronze, wood.
What accounts for that variation in price?
Material, workmanship, the finish inside.
You see, this is all silk.
I suppose the metal ones stand up the best.
Of course, the casket does not go directly into the ground, Tom.
We first sink a concrete outer vault.
That prevents seepage, et cetera.
- That's included in the price?
- Oh, yes.
I suppose the metal ones are welded at the seams.
Yes.
The plot up there is on a slope.
I suppose that's not so good.
I never thought of that when I bought it.
I don't think it makes much difference, Tom.
- For a child.
- Yes.
My mother would've fit into that.
She was just a little bit of a thing.
She died when I was 10.
I don't remember much about the funeral except for my father.
He had run out on us...
...but he came back when she died...
...and I wouldn't let him come to the cemetery.
Well, that's water over the dam...
...but this made me think of her.
Five hundred?
What do you think of this, Gene?
I like the colour of the silk.
Did you say this was silk or satin, Marvin?
Silk.
I don't think it makes any difference.
Whatever you say.
Well, I mean, they all go into that concrete thing.
This one's 800.
I don't see the difference.
I don't like the metal.
The wood seems warmer.
- Don't you agree, Gene?
- Yes, I do.
Nine hundred.
- Is there a tax?
- That includes the tax, Tom.
All right, let's settle on this and get out of here.
Fine.
I'd estimate that Mrs. Garrison should be...
That is if people want to come and pay their respects...
...about noon tomorrow?
- That's fine.
Like to see where Mrs. Garrison will be resting?
That won't be necessary.
- Will your sister be coming on?
- Yes, this afternoon.
Shall we go, Dad?
She was just a little bit of a thing.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm so glad you're here.
You didn't have to meet me in all this rain.
- I wanted to get out of the house.
- I can imagine.
How is he?
He's fine.
God, how fine he is.
What do you mean?
No change. No change that I can see.
Reverend Pell came, he told him his life story.
- How much money he made in 1929.
- Oh, God.
Damn it. You know, our mother just died...
...and I wanted to talk about her...
...but she was never mentioned.
Except as my inspiration, which is his cue to start the story of his life.
Sorry you've had to take it all alone.
I get so fed up with people coming up to me and saying:
"Your dad is a remarkable man."
Nobody ever talks about Mother.
You'd think he died.
I just wanna say to them,
"You don't know my father.
You just know the man in the newspapers.
He banished my sister for marrying a Jew. That didn't get in the papers."
What a night that was.
Mother running out, sobbing, you shouting at him, storming out...
...and the two of us sitting there, father and son...
...eating...
...in silence.
Afterwards, I threw up.
I shouted and you threw up.
That was pretty much the pattern.
I felt guilty about Mother all the way coming here.
I should've seen her more often, brought the kids more often.
Instead I sent flowers.
Well, that's inevitable.
I felt the same way.
You?
You made her life.
A son shouldn't have to make his mother's life.
Dad always said he didn't know the meaning of the word quit.
Well, he quit on her.
And l...
I was just there. l...
Every time I see him like this, asleep, the old tiger...
...the old man, my father.
Then he wakes up and becomes
Tom Garrison and I'm in trouble.
Margaret.
Dad.
I must have dozed off.
Where's your mother?
Dad, Alice is here.
Alice? What for?
Hello, Dad.
"For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God...
...to take from the world the soul of our departed sister...
...we commit her body to the ground.
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord."
Don't know how you feel...
...but I'd like to figure out some kind of memorial for Mother...
...use some of the money she left.
Yes, definitely.
Maybe some shelves of books for the children's library.
Christmas books with the stories she liked to tell.
That's a good idea.
Well, Gene, what are we going to do?
I don't know.
I think you should go and get married and move to California, but...
I might as well get it off my chest.
It would be murder if he came to live with us.
In the first place he wouldn't do it, feeling as he does about Sidney.
Kids can't stand how he tells them how to do everything.
I can't tell you how it makes me feel as a man...
...to see someone like that who's...
...distinguished and remarkable, just...
Just...
...become a nuisance.
I know I sound hard...
...but as long as we can be assured that he's taken care of...
Oh, I'll feel some guilt and you maybe more...
...but my responsibility is to my husband and children.
Yes.
- That's your responsibility.
- And your responsibility is to yourself.
Get married again to get away from memories of Carol...
...and her whole world.
- Oh, well...
Maybe it's Mother's death, the funeral.
All I can think about is Carol.
Gene, my friend, my brother.
Get out of here.
You know we only remember the terrible things about Dad.
I've been trying to remember some of the...
...others.
- What he did for us.
- I'm doing a lot for my kids.
I don't expect them to pay me back at the other end.
I'm sure we can find a full-time housekeeper and he can afford it.
He wouldn't agree to that.
Either that or finding a home.
We might as well face it.
His mind is going.
Sooner or later we'll have to start thinking powers of attorney...
...perhaps even committing him to an institution.
God, it's all so ugly.
He kicked me out.
He said he never wanted to see me again.
He broke Mother's heart over that for years.
He was mean, unloving.
He used to beat you when you were a kid if you disobeyed him.
You've hated and feared him all your adult life.
Still, he's my father and a man.
And what's happening to him as a man appals me.
You know how ashamed I feel.
Not being able to say to him:
"Papa, come live with me. I love you.
I wanna take care of you."
I'm going to talk to him tonight about a housekeeper.
I'll do the dirty work...
...but when he turns to you, don't you give in.
I've always wanted to love him.
I've always needed to love him.
How are you coming?
Oh, Alice.
I've written out receipts for you to sign for the jewellery your mother left you...
...and the things she left for Charlotte.
All right.
It may not be necessary, but as the executor...
...l'll be held responsible for these things.
- Dad, I wanna talk with you...
- All right.
But first I want Gene to hear this letter
I've written to Harry Hall.
He and I used to play golf together out in Jersey.
He wrote me a nice letter about your mother...
...and I've written to him.
It will only take a minute...
...if I can read my own shorthand.
"Dear Harry.
How thoughtful of you to write me on the occasion of Margaret's death.
It was quite a blow.
As you know, she was my inspiration...
...and had been since that day
55 years ago...
...when I first met her...
...when the clouds hung low and dark for me.
At the time, I was supporting my younger brother and sister...
...and my aged grandfather...
...in a two-room flat, going to work every day...
...in a lumber mill.
Providence, which has always been my guide...
...prompted me to take a night course in shorthand and typing...
...and also prompted me to go to the Underwood Typewriting Company...
...seeking a position as stenographer.
They sent me, God be praised...
...to the office of T.J. Parks of Colonial Brass...
...and a job that started at $5 a week...
...ended in 1954, when I retired...
...at 50,000 a year."
That's as far as I've gotten.
Dad, I don't think financial matters are appropriate...
...in answering a letter of condolence.
- But it's true.
You see, it follows. I'm saying that she was my inspiration...
...and it seems entirely appropriate to explain it.
It's your letter, Dad.
- Dad, I'm leaving tomorrow and...
- What?
I'm going home tomorrow.
Well, Alice,
I'm grateful to you for coming.
Your mother would've appreciated it.
She was very fond of you.
I think we ought to talk over what your plans are.
My plans?
I have many letters to answer...
...and a whole mess in my files and accounts.
If the income-tax people ever ask me to produce my books:
I didn't mean exactly that kind of plan.
I meant...
You plan to keep the house?
Why, of course. All my things are here.
It's... It's...
Oh, I'll be back on my feet.
My... will clear up...
...now this strain is over.
I'm confident I'll be in shape any day now.
I worry leaving you in this house alone, Dad.
I'm perfectly all right.
Don't you worry about me.
Either one of you.
Why... Why for the last year, ever since your mother's first attack...
...l've been getting the breakfasts, making the beds, using a dust rag.
And the laundress comes in once a week to clean up for me...
...and Gene here, he'll keep an eye on me, drop in once or twice a week.
- That's the point...
- Alice.
We think you should get a full-time housekeeper to live here.
Alone, here with me?
Well, that's not very proper, is it?
- Nevertheless...
- No.
Now, that's final.
- Gene and I would feel a lot better if...
- Look, Alice.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm perfectly all right.
You go. Leave with a clear mind.
I'm all right.
I will appreciate Gene's dropping in now and then, but I'm all right.
We would still like to get a full-time housekeeper.
What do you mean you would like to get?
I've hired and fired thousands of people in my day.
I don't need anyone getting someone for me.
- Well, will you do it yourself then?
- No.
I told you no.
Since I was 8 years old,
I've taken care of myself.
What would you know about it?
You were given everything on a platter.
At an age when you were swinging on that tree out there...
...breaking all the branches...
...I was selling newspapers five hours a day.
And at night, dancing a jig in saloons for pennies.
You tell me
I can't take care of myself.
If I want a housekeeper, and I don't,
I'll hire one myself.
I've hired and fired thousands of people in my day...
...when I was vice president of
Colonial Brass at 50,000 a year.
Two thousand people.
And you tell me I'm incompetent to hire a housekeeper.
How many people have you hired?
You teach.
All right. If that's what you want to do, that's your business...
...but don't talk to me about hiring and firing.
Dad, you might fall down.
Why fall down?
Nothing wrong with my balance.
- When you get up, you're dizzy.
- Nonsense. l...
I appreciate your concern...
...but I'm perfectly able to carry on by myself.
As I said, with Gene's help from time to time.
I imagine we could have dinner once in a while, couldn't we, Gene?
Once or twice a week?
Take you up to Rotary.
- Some of the speakers are amusing.
- Sure, Dad.
Give us time to get together at last, a chance to know each other.
Gene wants to get married.
- Alice.
- What?
Gene wants to move to California and get married.
Alice, will you shut up?
I can't help it.
You've never faced up to him.
- Let him ruin your life.
- I can handle my own life!
- You can't.
- Children.
Children.
I don't want to interfere with either of your lives.
I took of myself at 8,
I can take care of myself at 80.
I've never wanted to be a burden to my children.
- I'm gonna hang around, Dad.
- There's no need to.
I'll move in until you start feeling better.
I don't want to ruin your life.
I didn't say that.
I've long had the impression that my only function in this family...
...was to supply the money...
- Dad.
- To supply funds for your education.
- Dad, will you stop it!
As far as I'm concerned, this conversation has ended.
Alice, we've gotten along very well for some years without your attention...
- Dad.
- You sent me away. Don't forget that.
You chose to lead your own life.
Well, we won't keep you now.
Dad, come on, stop it.
I've been competent to go into the city year after year...
...to earn money for your clothes, your food, the roof over your head.
Am I now incompetent?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
For God's sakes, Alice...
I'm trying to get a practical matter accomplished.
You didn't have to destroy him in the process.
I wasn't discussing his competence, so that will be a matter for discussion.
You can go with a clear conscience.
I'm doing this because I want to.
You can't help yourself.
When I wanna be analysed,
I'll pay for it.
Did you see yourself when he started to rage? You shrank.
I shrank at the ugliness of what was happening.
You're staying because you can't stand his wrath the day you say:
"Dad, I'm leaving."
You've never been able to stand up to his anger.
Oh, look, Alice...
He'll call you ungrateful and you'll believe him.
What do you want us to do?
Let it be known that Alice and Gene...
...have done all we can to help this old man...
...in old age and make him happy...
...without inconveniencing ourselves.
He's refused our help, so if he falls and hits his head...
...lies and rots, it's not our fault.
Don't think anyone expects us to ruin our lives...
...for an unreasonable old man.
- It's not gonna ruin my life.
- It is.
- It's a week or a month.
- Forever.
Oh, Alice...
...let's stop this.
I know what I'm gonna do.
I just can't do anything else.
Maybe there isn't the same thing between a mother and a daughter...
...but the old man in me...
...wants to extend some kind of mercy to that old man.
I never had a father.
I ran away from him, he ran away from me.
Maybe he's right.
It's time we found each other.
Excuse me for saying so, but I find that a lot of sentimental crap.
What do you hope to find?
You hope to find love?
Can't tell from what he said what you're going to find?
Alice, don't give me the textbooks.
He wants your balls.
And he's had them.
I'm sorry.
I want to shock you.
When has he ever regarded you as a man...
...an equal, a male?
When you were a Marine.
And that you did for him.
You didn't wanna be a Marine.
"Now, Papa, will you love me?"
When was he ever proud of the things you do?
The things you value?
When did he ever mention your teaching or your books...
...except in scorn?
I just do not wanna let my father die a stranger.
You're looking for something that isn't there, Gene.
You're looking for a mother's love in a father.
Mothers are soft and yielding.
Fathers are hard and rough...
...to teach us the way of the world...
...which is rough, which is mean...
...which is selfish and prejudiced.
That's your definition.
Because of what he did, you're entitled to it.
I've always been grateful for what he did to me, kicking me out.
He taught me a marvellous lesson, and has made me able to face a lot.
And there's been a lot to face, and so I'm grateful as hell to him.
If I couldn't get the understanding and compassion from a father...
...who could I expect it from?
So I learned, and I didn't expect it.
And I've found very little, and so I'm grateful to him.
I'm grateful as hell to him.
Let's not argue anymore.
I'm gonna stay, Alice...
...for a while, at least, for whatever reasons.
And Peggy?
Oh, we'll see.
She'll be here in a week for a meeting.
Don't lose her, Gene.
Maybe I'm still fouled up on myself...
...but I think I've spoken near the truth about you.
Suddenly I miss Mother so.
Board!
Let me emphasise that this place would only be equipped to handle your dad...
...while he's still able to function reasonably well.
Of course, at Christmas we fix it up with holly and candles.
Make it very attractive.
This is a superior place.
Rates run around $50 a day.
Well, the state hospital's just a few minutes drive from here.
Oh, my God.
It may sound brutal to say it...
...but that's the other side of our miracle drugs.
We keep them alive...
...but a grim alternative.
Attention, please.
Flight number 10 from Los Angeles...
...has arrived at Gate Number 3.
Come over here.
It's great to see you.
The real world.
Promise me one thing.
We'll die young.
It's a little late for me.
I mean, before we...
Before we become public nuisances.
Oh, my love.
It's been rough.
- That old man...
- I know.
I see it all the time.
Have you managed to find a housekeeper for him?
I looked at the homes the other day.
The institutions, it's...
We'd all come east, you know.
The kids.
- lf you want it that way.
- I don't want it that way.
I don't know what I want.
I just know I want you.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
I told you when I left
I'd be out tonight.
- You did?
- Yes.
Oh, well, my mind's a complete sieve.
Dad, this is Peggy Thayer.
Dr. Peggy Thayer.
Oh, doctor,
I have a slight pain right here.
- How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do, Mr. Garrison?
I don't think Peggy can help you much.
She's a gynaecologist.
- A what?
- I'm a woman's doctor.
Oh, yes, yes. Margaret was always running to one of those.
Well, I'll just have to take my trade to someone else.
I must apologise for the condition of this house.
You see,
Mrs. Garrison passed on just recently.
Yes. I was very sorry to hear about that.
Hundreds of letters to answer.
And look at this, we simply must do something about this.
Your mother's magazine subscriptions.
And this book club.
I've been reading some of it.
Absolutely revolting...
...the things they get away with nowadays.
I'm sure you don't read things like this.
What you mean
"things like this," Dad?
I'm not going to describe them in front of this charming girl.
Are you from this area, Miss?
- Did you tell me your name?
- Dad, this is Peggy from California.
Oh, yes.
- Do you intend to stay long, Miss...?
- Please, call me Peggy.
May I? Thank you.
Is that your real name, or is it short for Margaret?
- My real name's Margaret.
- My wife's name was Margaret.
But she was never called Peggy or Maggy.
Always Margaret.
Yes, it would never have occurred to me to call her Peggy.
She was a Margaret, but Peggy is right for you.
I'm gonna go tuck him in and say good night.
- Gene.
- What?
- Don't get mad.
- What?
I think he's charming.
Most people do.
I'll just be a minute.
- You ready to be tucked in?
- Yes.
Look at all the weight I've lost.
You got quite a little pot there.
Yeah, but through here, through my chest.
We're gonna put all that back on you.
You know, I never had any hair on my chest.
I don't understand it.
You had hair on your chest.
I just never had any.
Oh, well. I'm confident if I can get some exercise.
Remember when I used to get you up in the morning...
...we'd go down...
...do callisthenics to the radio?
- Oh, yeah.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Take it easy, now.
Gotta wait till morning for that.
And then we'd put on the gloves and spar on the side porch.
- Oh, yeah.
- The manly art of self-defence.
Gentleman Jim Corbett.
Wait, wait, wait.
- Hey!
- What?
Well, I'm gonna get over to the club and play some golf.
Sit around and swap stories with the boys.
Too bad you never took up golf.
I was just going through these desk drawers.
I don't know, just going over things...
...pictures.
I think you've seen most of them.
The family.
You know, Dad...
...I don't think I've ever seen a picture of your father.
He's just a boy.
That was just about the time he got married.
Oh, he was a fine looking man before he started drinking.
Big, square, high colour...
...but he became my mortal enemy.
Did I ever show you this? Careful.
I made a home for my brother and sister.
We were out one day and he came around...
...and ripped up all my sister's clothes and shoes.
Drunk, of course.
A few days later he came around to apologise...
...and ask for some money...
...and I threw him out.
The next day he left that note.
- And you kept it?
- Yeah.
I didn't see him again till many years later...
...when he was dying in Bellevue.
Somebody got word to me.
And I went down to see if he wanted anything.
He said he'd like some fruit.
So I sent him in some oranges.
He died the next day.
There must have been something there to love, understand.
In my father?
Do you remember this, Gene?
"To the greatest dad in the world on Father's Day, 1946."
I appreciate that, Gene.
That's a lovely tribute.
I think I have all of your Father's Day cards here.
You know, I never wanted children, coming from the background I did.
We didn't have Alice for a long time...
...but Margaret finally persuaded me.
She said they'd be a comfort in our old age.
And you are, Gene.
Well, l...
A programme of yours in college, some glee club concert.
I have everything in here but the kitchen stove.
- Do you still sing?
- No, Dad. No, I haven't for years.
Oh, that's too bad.
You had a good voice.
Well, we can't do everything.
Oh, I remember your mother would sit at the piano, hour after hour...
...and I'd be up here at my desk, listening to you sing.
You always used to asked me to sing
"When I Grow Too Old To Dream."
Did I?
I don't remember your ever singing that.
You always seemed to be just finishing when I came into the room.
Did you used to sing that for me?
No...
...but you always asked me to sing it for you.
Well, I certainly enjoyed sitting up here and listening.
- That was my mother.
- Oh, yes.
I've seen this, Dad.
It's lovely.
She was just 25 when that was taken.
She died the next year.
I used to carry it in my wallet all the time...
...and I felt I was wearing it out, so I put it away.
Just a little bit of a thing.
Hey. Hey.
Dad.
I never thought it would be like this.
I always thought I'd go first.
I'm sorry.
Just comes over me. l...
It'll pass.
I'll get hold of myself.
Don't try, Dad. Believe me, it's best.
No, no, it...
It's just that...
- I'll be all right.
- No, it's rough, Dad.
- It's bound to be rough.
- It'll pass.
It'll pass.
- Want me to put these things away?
- No, I can...
Yes, if you would.
I don't know what we'd do without you, Gene.
Dad. How'd you like Peggy?
Who?
Oh, yes.
Oh, very nice, very attractive.
Dad, I'm thinking very seriously about marrying her...
...and going out to California to live.
Dad, I know this is your home, what you're used to...
...but, well, I'd like you to come out there with me, Dad.
It's lovely out there.
We'd get you an apartment close to us.
You know...
...I would like to make a suggestion.
- All right.
Why don't you all come here to live?
- Peggy has her practice out there, Dad.
- A what?
She's a doctor. I told you.
And she has children and they have their school and friends.
Well, we have a big house here, and you always liked this house.
It's wonderful for children.
You used to play baseball out back...
...and then there's that basketball thing.
Well, Dad, I'd like to get away from this country for a while.
It's been rough here ever since Carol died...
...and it would be good for you, getting away.
Your mother would be very happy to have the house full of children.
I won't be around long, and then, it's all yours.
Dad, that's very kind of you.
I don't think it would work out.
Besides, Peggy's work and her children...
...all her family's out there.
Your family's here.
Yes, I know.
You know, Gene, I'm just saying this for your own good...
...but you went out to California shortly after Carol's death...
...and you were exhausted from her long illness...
...and, well, naturally, very susceptible.
I'm wondering if you waited long enough to know your mind.
I know my own mind.
I mean, taking on another man's children.
Did you mention this business to your mother?
Yes, she told me to go with her blessing.
She would say that, of course, but I warned you.
Oh, for God's sakes.
All right, go ahead.
I can manage. Send me a Christmas card, if you remember.
- Dad.
- What?
- I've asked you to come with me.
- I'm not going.
I understand that but not this
"send me a card, if you remember."
I'm sorry if I offend you.
Your mother always said
I mustn't raise my voice to you.
Want me to make it easy for you the way your mother did?
Well, I won't. If you wanna go, go!
Oh, goddamn it.
I always knew it would be like this after your mother was gone.
I was only tolerated in this house because I paid the bills.
- Oh, shut up.
- Don't you tell me to shut up.
Shut up!
I've asked you to come with me.
What do you want?
What the hell do you want?
If I lived here the rest of my life, it wouldn't be enough for you.
I've tried, goddamn it,
I've tried to be the dutiful son.
Commanded into your presence on every conceivable occasion.
Easter, birthdays, Christmas,
Thanksgiving.
Even the Thanksgiving when Carol was dying, I was with her in the hospital.
"We miss you.
Our day is nothing without you.
Could you come after you leave Carol?"
You had no regard for what was really going on. My wife was dying!
Is it so terrible to wanna see your own son?
It's terrible to wanna possess him entirely and completely, yes.
There'll be some papers to sign for your mother's estate.
- Leave an address with your lawyer.
- Oh, Dad.
From tonight on, you can consider me dead.
I've given you everything.
Since I was a snot-nosed kid...
...l've worked my fingers to the bone for you.
You had everything, I had nothing.
I put a roof over your head, clothes on your back.
- Food on the table.
- You ungrateful bastard!
What do you want for gratitude?
Nothing!
Nothing would be enough for you!
You resented every damn thing you ever gave me!
The orphan boy in you resented everything!
I'm sorry as hell about your miserable childhood.
When you used to tell me those stories,
I'd come to my room and cry...
...but there's nothing I can do about it now...
...and it does not excuse everything.
And I am grateful to you!
I admire, respect you, stand in awe of what you've done.
I'll never even be able to touch it.
But it does not make me love you, and I wanted to love you.
You hated your father and I saw what that did to you...
...and I did not wanna hate you.
- I don't care what you feel about me.
- Well, I do.
I came so close to loving you tonight.
I'd never felt so open to you.
You don't know what it cost me to ask you to come.
When I've never been able to sit in the same room alone with you.
You think your door was always open to me?
It's not my fault if you never came through it.
Goodbye, Dad.
- I'll have somebody stay with you.
- I don't want anybody.
I can take care of myself.
I've always had to take care of myself.
Who needs you? Out!
I've lived my whole life...
...so that I could look any man in the eye and tell him to go to hell.
That night,
I left my father's house forever.
I took the first right and the second left...
...and this time, went as far as California.
We saw each other a few times after that.
We visited him and he visited us...
...but then the arteries began to harden.
We put him in a hospital...
...and he gradually slipped into speechless senility.
Not long after...
...sitting and staring without comprehension...
...at the television...
...he died...
...alone...
...without even an orange in his hand.
Death ends a life...
...but it does not end a relationship...
...which struggles on in the surviv or's mind...
...towards some resolution which it may never find.
Alice.
Alice said I would not accept the sadness of this world.
What does it matter if I never loved him...
...or he never loved me?
Perhaps she was right.
But still...
...when I hear the word "father"...
...it matters.
2130, day 547.
Unscheduled course correction due at 2200.
Pre-correction check:
Rotation axis plus three degrees.
Nitrous oxide pressure:
4,100, rising to 5,000.
Quad jets C and D on pre-select.
Rotor ignition sequence beginning in 3-0.
Thruster line reactors on standby.
Vincent, notify me with 15 to go.
- Alex?
- Yes, Dan.
Have you determined the difference in ETAs with and without our correction?
Working on it. You know, we shouldn't be needing a direction at this time.
Vincent, run a confirmation on the last inertial fix... and check it with another celestial, please.
I have.
It is correct... but I think I've found the reason for our present variation.
- Mr Pizer.
- Yes, Vincent.
Mr Pizer, I think you should come up here.
What's up, Vincent?
The largest black hole
I have ever encountered, Mr Pizer.
Hmm. Let's have a look at it on the holograph.
My God!
Right out of Dante's Inferno.
Yes. The most destructive force in the universe, Harry.
Nothing can escape it, not even light.
I had a professor who predicted that eventually black holes... would devour the entire universe.
Why not, when you can see giant suns sucked in and disappear without a trace?
- Give us the magnification, Vincent.
- Polarizing image.
Every time I see one of those things,
I expect to spot some guy in red with horns and a pitchfork.
It's a monster, all right.
A rip in the very fabric of space and time... but I picked up something else of interest.
- Let's see it.
- It hasn't moved since I first picked it up.
- It seems to be some kind of ship.
- Do you copy, Alex?
- Roger, Dan.
- Enlarge again, Vincent, and let's try to identify it.
But how could anybody be out here ahead of us?
Arcturius-10, United Kingdom.
Liberty-7, United States.
Russian experimental space station,
series five.
France, Sahara Module 5-3.
Pluto-4, Japan.
United States,
Space Probe One.
- That's it.
- USS Cygnus.
Dr Kate, wasn't that the ship
your father was on?
USS Cygnus.
Its mission: To discover habitable life in outer space. Same as ours.
Signal that ship, Vincent.
- Activate the sensors, Charlie.
- You bet.
They were recalled to Earth
20 years ago... their mission considered a failure.
How that must have galled
Dr Hans Reinhardt.
Did you ever meet
Commander Reinhardt?
Collided with him would be a more accurate description.
- A legend.
- So he believed.
Reinhardt had the knack of making his own ambitions... seem like a matter of national pride.
Why, he talked the space appropriations committee... into the costliest fiasco of all time... and refused to admit failure.
He ignored his recall.
Maybe not.
Maybe it never got through.
That ship just... just disappeared.
They've never been seen again.
Dan, get us in close enough. Vincent and I could get aboard on tethers.
To quote Cicero, "Rashness is the characteristic of youth... prudence that of mellowed age and discretion the better part of valour."
No sense leaving the story of a lifetime untold, Captain.
I believe there is, Harry... and it's looking straight at us.
Picking up anything on the sensors, Charlie?
Negative, but with all that turbulence...
out there, our signal
might not be getting through.
According to my instruments, it hasn't moved a centimetre... since we first spotted it.
But, Alex, how can a lifeless derelict defy that kind of gravity?
I don't know, but it's certainly worth investigating.
My instincts
are against it, Alex... but we'll go in for a closer look.
Fix a coordinate approach, Charlie.
Full power on the thrusters, Vincent.
Strap yourselves in. We'll be feeling the gravitational force... right now.
Range: 29551 and closing.
What's your reading on Cygnus, Vincent?
Triangulation shows it's still holding steady, sir.
- Gravity pull?
- .02450 and rising.
Puts us in an escape attitude of
8-5 degrees. Cut power by two-thirds.
- 8-5 degrees.
She's bucking like a bronco.
- Gravity?
.46960, still climbing.
Switching to manual.
Captain, I'm not sure how long the engines will remain operable... against that much force when we turn back.
Alex, gravity's close to maximum.
We can afford one pass, and then we're gonna have to get the hell out.
- Zero gravity.
- Cut the power.
Smooth as glass.
It's like being in the eye of a hurricane.
- What happened?
- Natural phenomenon.
Or something from that ship.
Activating the microbeam.
Picking up anything, Charlie?
Negative, Alex. No way our signals can't get through this time.
- Gravity's at maximum, Dan.
- My God, I think it's got us.
We're starting to tumble.
Hundred percent on the roll jet quads.
Roll jet quads, full capacity.
- Air break at midship. Losing oxygen.
- Charlie... give me a full burst at 180 degrees, main thrusters.
We got a break here too!
Emergency readouts show the primary and secondary air lines ruptured!
Never rains.
Full-pitch attitude thrusters,
A and B rings.
The black hole is pulling us in.
Going to manual.
The number four hatch blew outward,
Captain. I'll go out and secure it.
Watch yourself out there, Vincent.
There's more gravity pull than we've ever encountered.
Yes, sir.
Alex, we'd better check out the damage below!
Vincent, do you read me?
Come in, Vincent.
Kate, either we have a malfunction here... or there's too much interference on the outside.
See if you can get through to Vincent with your ESP.
I got through to Vincent.
He said there are old pilots and there are bold pilots... but there are very few old, bold pilots.
She's tuned in on Vincent, all right.
Grab my leg! My leg!
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
And that's got it!
Hit the boosters, Charlie. We gotta make a run for that zero gravity.
He secured the hatch!
Good.
We can only make temporary repairs
here, Dan, and that's only
to the secondary line.
Unless we can replace the damaged parts in the main regulator... we're gonna lose our oxygen supply.
Damn!
Dan, the tether's broken.
- I'm going after him.
- Stay at your post, Charlie.
What the hell are you made of?
- What if it were one of us out there?
- Vincent is one of us.
Reverse thrusters and look for a place to set down.
- What's going on?
- That's what I'd like to know.
Like a tree on Christmas morning.
Locking warheads into firing position.
Hold it, Dan. They've got to be friendly. They could have blasted us right out of the sky.
Your side, Dan.
You got a picture down there?
- There are people on board.
- Just a shadow, Kate.
Enlarge, please.
There are people, Alex.
I know it. I feel it.
Docking elevator coming up.
Wonder why they didn't roll out the red carpet earlier.
I don't know, and I don't like it.
But they're calling the shots, and we've got to repair this craft.
Dan, I'm sorry I blew my stack.
I guess we all have a soft spot for the little guy, Charlie.
- Yeah.
- All right, let's bring her in.
Okay.
Bingo.
We have gravity.
Nice work, Vincent.
Out of the frying pan; hopefully, not into the fire.
- Are you all right, Vincent?
- Nothing a hammer and a little metal polish can't fix. Thank you.
Looks like we'll have to go to them.
- Charlie, you'll stay with the Palomino.
- But you need everyone that's got...
- Charlie.
- Don't worry, Mr Pizer.
They also serve who only stand and wait.
Vincent, were you programmed to bug me?
No, sir, to educate you.
When I volunteered for this mission,
I never thought I'd end up playing straight man to a tin can.
This place looks as if it hasn't been used for years.
It's eerie. I feel like a thousand eyes are watching us.
Vincent!
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Vincent, are you all right?
Weapons destroyed by laser fire.
No injuries. Hold your position.
Vincent.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Down, but never for the full count, Dr Kate.
- So much for the friendship theory.
- Come on, Harry. They could have killed us if they'd wanted to.
Yeah, sure.
I don't like it when somebody else pulls the strings, Captain.
Neither do I, Vincent.
Whoever's up in that control tower is calling the shots right now.
Whoever or whatever, Captain.
- Easy, Kate.
- I know I shouldn't get my hopes up, but it's hard not to.
I know.
I don't mind telling you,
I'm a little concerned.
Some of my brother robots were assigned to Project Black Hole... programmed to send ESP messages back from space probes.
Oh, a grand experiment, the scientists thought.
Also ancient history, Vincent.
Not to me, Mr Booth.
Not this close.
The heat in there melts types like me rather quickly.
Hello? I'm Kate McCrae.
Is Officer Frank McCrae aboard?
They appear to be some sort of robot, Dr Kate.
Look over here.
Incredible.
It oughta be.
Sure cost the taxpayers enough.
Kate.
There's someone else with us.
Identify yourself.
What is your type and model?
- A mystery monster.
- Don't move.
Charlie, do you read me?
Charlie Pizer. Come in, Charlie.
This is the story to end all stories, Harry.
A ship of robots and computers with this thing in charge?
Not quite, Dr Durant.
Maximilian and my robots only run this ship the way I wish it run.
How do you know my name?
You were monitored ever since our sensors first detected you.
Now, now, Maximilian.
Calm down.
Don't pick on small people.
Such a nice little robot.
He's harmless.
Miss McCrae, you might come closer.
Welcome aboard the Cygnus.
Hans Reinhardt.
It can't be.
You always did have a flair for theatrical entrances, Doctor.
Dr Reinhardt.
My father, where is he?
My dear child,
I'm sorry to dash your hopes... but your father's not with us any more.
He's dead.
A man to be proud of.
A grave personal loss to me.
He was a trusted and loyal friend.
And you are his daughter.
Yes. The same eyes.
The same eyes.
And the rest of the crew?
- They didn't make it back?
- They did not.
Pity, for such a good crew.
What happened when your mission was recalled, Doctor?
Is this going to be an interview, Mr Booth?
I haven't had that for a long time, but if you want to...
I will answer.
Now, don't be frightened.
Nobody's going to harm you.
The Cygnus encountered a field of meteorites... and was disabled... our main and auxiliary communication systems smashed.
We were adrift.
I told the crew to abandon ship... to return home as ordered.
Perhaps it was another of what you term my "theatrical gestures," Mr Booth... but I chose to remain aboard.
Your dear father chose to remain with me.
We never knew what happened to the others.
You've lived out here for 20 years? Alone?
Twenty years?
Twenty Earth years, but...
I didn't live exactly alone.
I've created companions of a sort.
They look a bit medieval... but I'm a romantic.
Ah, Mr Pizer!
Come in. Join us.
Thank you.
Have you met the goon squad?
"Goon squad." Nice.
I'm Hans Reinhardt.
Forgive this little incident, but you were disarmed for your own safety.
Dismissed.
My robots are programmed to react against any act of aggression.
I assure you, none was intended.
I am glad to hear that. Please.
Consider yourselves my guests.
We won't impose on your hospitality, Doctor.
Just long enough to repair our ship.
And then we can offer you the means of returning to Earth, Doctor.
What makes you think
I want to return?
The Cygnus is in danger of being destroyed here.
Yes! Your captain was worried about that too.
One step too far... and we are done.
But there's no cause for alarm.
We developed antigravity forces to maintain our position.
It's what you might call a Mexican stand-off.
If you were monitoring us, you must have picked up our signals.
- That's right.
- You failed to reply.
Did I have to reply?
Charlie, Charlie.
Slight communications problem.
Maximilian will take you to requisition whatever you need to repair your ship.
In the meantime, you and Dr McCrae will get enough information... to make your mission of historic importance.
- Back off, Vincent.
- Not until he does.
When you're nose to nose with a trash compactor, you cool it.
Now, what does that remind me of?
Oh, yes. David and Goliath.
A classic confrontation.
Only this time,
David is overmatched.
Call him off, Reinhardt.
I said call him off!
On my ship, you ask, Captain.
Indeed.
Please, call him off, Doctor.
Maximilian?
Remember, these are our guests.
Now, let him in.
Show that you've good manners.
That's a good robot.
Communication problems aside, he took an awful long time to show any lights.
- Be careful.
- I know.
Those other robots aren't any friendlier than Dr Frankenstein's monster.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Maybe you should've smiled when you said it, Vincent.
Doctor, this ship doesn't appear to be crippled.
Of course not. We repaired the damage and became operable again.
But you never obeyed the order to return to Earth.
That's right.
I refused this order.
There were larger considerations... other worlds yet to be explored... life dreams unrealized.
The authorities would still consider that an act of piracy, Doctor.
What would you have said, Mr Booth, if the authorities... would have called back Columbus just before he discovered the New World?
You wouldn't even exist.
I'm about to prove to you that the end justifies the means.
Pretty busy around here, Max.
What are you gearing up for?
Tell you what, Charlie.
You'll take care of business here, and I'll go back to the ship and start working on that regulator.
Don't bother to point the way, Max.
I'll find it by myself.
Well, we need primary and secondary demand oxygen pressure regulators... and an ECS proportion flow valve controller.
Max.
Dr Reinhardt told you to requisition the parts for us.
Let's get cracking.
Way to go, Max.
Way to go.
Vincent. Vital Information
Necessary Centralized.
Labour force. The 396.
I see by your markings you're from the old 2-8.
Programmed in Houston.
There is enough instant energy down there to supply all of Earth.
The first step to colonizing the galaxy.
You will be remembered as one of the greatest space scientists of all time.
I have never doubted that.
It's about time that people learn about their failures and my successes.
You should come back with us and enjoy the glory of that success.
I don't want to go back, and I don't enjoy successes any more.
There is too much at stake to pull back.
I'm on the brink of a great achievement.
All this is just the beginning.
- The beginning? Of what?
- You will know in due time.
Dr Reinhardt, could we have a demonstration...
- of this incredible new power source.
- Harry?
Come with me, and I'll show you everything.
I call it "Cygnium," after my ship.
Must've made a wrong turn, Max.
Quite a layout.
I said it's quite a layout you got here.
Can you speak?
Are you programmed to speak?
No, I guess not.
No, I guess that'd make you a little bit too real, wouldn't it?
That Reinhardt sure loves to play God, doesn't he?
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey!
- I know what I saw, Charlie.
- Dan, nobody buries a robot.
- I didn't say it was a robot.
- Then what?
I don't know what they shot out into space, but they did it with all the reverence and honour of a human funeral.
Huh. Maybe Reinhardt lied.
Maybe there are some survivors still alive. What do you think he's up to?
- Haven't got a clue.
- Well, whatever it is... he seems cooperative enough about getting us operable.
A wolf remains a wolf... even if it has not eaten your sheep.
Correct, Vincent. The sooner we blast out of here, the better.
Whatever you say.
Let's snap it up, Vincent.
A pint cannot hold a quart,
Mr Pizer.
If it holds the pint, it's doing the best it can.
Thank you, Vincent.
- Fascinating.
- From a distance.
Are you interested in black holes?
How can one not be overwhelmed by the deadliest force in the universe?
That long, dark tunnel to nowhere.
Or somewhere.
These are exactly answers yet to be explored.
You've defined the power of the black hole with your antigravity calculations.
A stunning achievement, sir.
- You think so?
- Yes. I do.
Thank you.
I think, Dr Durant... that you are a man who longs for a sense... of his own greatness... but has not yet found his true direction.
Right?
Perhaps I could find it here... if you're in no hurry for us to leave.
Shall we discuss that over dinner?
- It's only dinner.
- "Said the spider to the fly."
I should be with you.
Yeah, we'll be safer without you and Max trying to knock heads.
I can handle that thing.
Well, far be it from you to admit there isn't anything you can't handle.
There are three basic types,
Mr Pizer. The wills, the won'ts and the can'ts.
The wills accomplish everything, the won'ts oppose everything... and the can'ts won't try anything.
Well, do us all a favour, Vincent, and try to be a can't... especially where that monster's concerned.
We need you, not another corkscrew.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
Vincent, you're gonna have the time of your life in there.
I don't mean to sound superior, but I hate the company of robots.
So try and relax.
Have some fun.
Remember what they say:
"All work and no play"?
"All sunshine makes a desert," so the Arabs say.
You'll alert me if you're in trouble, Captain?
Why don't you go on in there and have some laughs, Vincent.
We've been in some scrapes before, and we're gonna get out of this one.
As you were.
- Who's the flashy black hat?
- S-T-A-R.
Special Troops Arms Regiment.
Reinhardt's prototype for the sentry robots.
He was number one until Reinhardt built Maximilian.
He's sharp, but we're sharper.
Do you ever go up against him?
- Once.
- What happened?
I beat him. He got so upset, he blew a fuse.
He had his revenge, though.
He did things to me that I sure don't like to think about.
A great many experiments are in progress aboard the Cygnus, gentlemen... some of them dangerous.
I suggest in the interest of your own safety... that there are no more unescorted excursions for the duration of your stay.
- Agreed?
- Sure, sure.
Good. Please, sit down.
Captain.
Well, Mr Booth, what's new on Earth?
Well, I don't think it's changed very much since you left, Doctor.
Nothing much ever changes.
Same news, different names.
- You still writing for the same paper?
- The same.
Still on strike?
Ah, fresh mushroom soup.
Prepared from my own personal garden.
I remember writing about the extensive agricultural station.
Large enough to supply the needs of the entire crew, wasn't it, Doctor?
These days it's tiny.
Just enough for one person.
Ah. Naturally.
Our wine and our spare parts are vintage, Captain.
I hope they're satisfactory.
We've had to modify a few of the parts, Doctor... but, uh, that shouldn't take long.
- We'll be ready to leave soon.
- Speak for yourself, Dan.
I, for one, believe I have a great deal to learn from Dr Reinhardt.
Thank you.
Our mission's finished, Alex.
A toast.
To you and your companions,
Dr Durant... on the occasion of your visit to the Cygnus.
Welcome aboard, Miss Kate.
The only Earth people to know of my existence.
And to you, sir, and your magnificent accomplishments.
Tonight, my friends... we stand on the brink... of a feat unparalleled in space exploration.
If the data on my returning probe ship matches my computerized calculations...
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In... through... and beyond.
Why, that's crazy.
Ha! Impossible!
The word "impossible,"
Mr Booth... is only found in a dictionary of fools.
Are there any more like us left on board?
I'm the last one. These upstarts think I'm some old freak.
They still haven't improved on our model. Oh, you can't modify perfection. We are the best.
Oh, lordy.
He wants a rematch.
As an old navy hero once said,
"Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead!"
He also said something about goin' in harm's way.
Nice shooting, Bob.
You'd have beat him again if he hadn't bumped you.
Nah, I'd have missed on purpose.
Don't worry. I'll uphold the honour of the old outfit.
STAR, Vincent's my name.
Sharpshooting is my game.
Try me.
Your probe ship has only gone to the event horizon, Doctor... not into the black hole itself.
How do you expect the Cygnus to escape being crushed by the force in there?
I would assume that Dr Reinhardt has created an antigravitational force field... capable of withstanding that stress.
Indeed, and I know you will say,
Captain, that one mistake in navigation can be fatal.
But I know exactly what I'm doing.
The course I have chosen... will take the Cygnus through at its optimum angle of rotation.
The vortex will cause us to move at incredible speed... and that angle will slingshot us through.
Nice shot, STAR.
Simple, but nice.
Tricky. Here, try this.
If one dances, one must pay the piper.
If there's anything I cannot stand, it's a sore loser.
Meet me in parts storage.
So, as I understand it, you want the Palomino to monitor your journey.
That's right. I need you to go to another place and another time... a place where, if you're lucky...
I'll have the possibility to find what we call "the ultimate knowledge."
Yes, Maximilian?
The probe ship is about to dock.
Continue your meal, gentlemen.
Cuckoo as a Swiss clock.
My name's Bob,
Bio-sanitation Battalion.
I couldn't talk freely before, but I have a whole lot to tell you.
If Maximilian knew you were here, why, it'd be the end for the both of us.
Can you permanently rearm my lasers?
Yeah, I can. Vincent, you and your friends are in grave danger.
Reinhardt only turned the lights on to prevent any damage to the Cygnus.
This is a death ship.
What does your intuition tell you, Kate?
That Dr Reinhardt is walking a tightrope between genius and insanity.
- I think the guy's nuts.
- I don't buy that.
Well, whatever he is, he's an out-and-out liar.
That tiny little one-man garden of his is big enough to feed an army.
Nothing strange about that.
It purifies the air.
- Oh.
- Tell them about the funeral, Dan.
A robot funeral, Alex.
It was almost human.
Look. Granted, the 20 years out of contact with people... has made this man a little eccentric, but you can't ask me to believe... that he's programmed his robots to feel emotions.
- Come on.
- I know what I saw, Alex... and we only have Reinhardt's word for what happened to his crew.
All I know is that that robot gardener was almost human too.
Ha! He even walked with a limp.
What spooks you about a malfunctioning robot, Harry?
I wasn't spooked, old buddy.
I'm just telling you that I had a gut feeling that... that I was looking at some kind of... some kind of person.
- What are you getting at?
- That we make our apologies, say our goodbyes... and get off this ship as quick as we can.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Dan.
Now, hold it, hold it.
Now, now, now, l-let's stop and figure this thing out.
If Reinhardt has antigravity strong enough to hold him here...
I figure he's got enough to pull away.
- So?
- "So"?
So why not take this ship and Reinhardt back home?
That's a long shot you're talking about, Harry.
Aw, come on. You've got two scientific wizards here... to figure out the computers, a-and they can even reprogram the robots.
And the three of us can handle Reinhardt and that pet monster of his.
I'm tellin' you, we could all be heroes.
We could also be dead.
These poor creatures are what's left of the crew.
Kept alive by means
I don't pretend to understand.
Humans?
They're more robot than human.
Let's get outta here before we're discovered.
Too late. Watch it!
Think there are any more?
All clear.
Let's get rid of the evidence.
Maximilian will take you to Debriefing.
I will check out your computers personally.
How long before they'll start searching for these two?
It depends on their duty schedule.
Could be anytime.
Then we have to move fast.
So, he neglected his duty to his country for a higher ideal.
So what? What basis in fact do you have for these macabre speculations?
I agree that his style is somewhat unconventional... but he's willing and eager to share his knowledge with us.
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- We're not staying aboard this ship any longer than we have to, Alex.
- I think that's up to Reinhardt to decide.
- Dan.
Vincent wants you aboard the Palomino right away.
Let's go, Charlie.
I think I'll tag along.
This isn't our party.
Let's get outta here.
Reinhardt will solve the one final mystery that has eluded mankind.
Or he'll die in the attempt.
Alex, I'm beginning to feel you want to go with him.
On a glorious pilgrimage, straight into what may be the mind of God?
I do. I do.
"And darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
What an incredible sight.
I still haven't got used to it.
Where are the others?
- They were recalled to the ship.
- Recalled?
Didn't I say no more unescorted excursions?
Where was your communication?
Ah, the ESP you share with the robot.
Extraordinary.
Dr Durant.
- Yes, Doctor?
- These are all my formulas
I've compiled over the years.
I want you to take them back with you... and pass them on to others in case something might happen to me.
You can depend on me.
I also want you to monitor my flight.
Stay as long as you can at the event horizon.
There might be an Einstein-Rosen bridge to consider.
I will.
Believe me, I've been waiting a long time... for someone like you to record this moment.
Thank you, Doctor.
Then I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to the possibility... to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There, long-cherished laws of nature... simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
The officer the men trusted most was Frank McCrae.
- Kate's father.
- They turned to him when Dr Reinhardt ignored the orders to return home.
He tried to take control of the Cygnus.
Reinhardt called it mutiny and killed Mr McCrae.
- What became of the crew?
- They were captured by the sentry robots and are still on board.
- What?
- Where?
In the command tower, the power centre.
Robots, Mr Pizer, humanoid robots.
The most valuable thing in the universe... intelligent life, means nothing to Dr Reinhardt.
Without their wills, the crew became things he could command.
- That explains the funeral.
- Right.
And the limping robot you spotted.
Do you mean to tell me that there's actually a human body under that clothing?
Exactly, Mr Booth.
We can't just take off and leave these poor devils behind.
Harry, looks like we're gonna have to try your plan.
What? And end up just like the rest of the crew?
Why, if they couldn't pull it off, what chance do we have?
Captain, the damage is irreversible.
Death is their only release.
That's right. For God's sakes, Dan, we can't take on that mechanical army.
Captain, I was forced to destroy two sentry robots.
The others are searching now.
If they're found...
- Gotcha, Vincent.
Charlie, start the countdown.
- Right.
Vincent, tell Kate I want her and Alex back here on the double.
Fix navigational course.
You have achieved all this on your own, Dr Reinhardt... and you would have every right to reject the request of a comparative stranger, but...
What are you hoping for, Alex?
Immortality?
No, scientific truth.
Alex, we have to board right away.
They're waiting to blast off.
Prepare reactors!
Maximilian!
- How are your readings, Vincent?
- All systems are go, Mr Pizer.
Alex, I will not have you throwing your life away for this.
- He can do it. I know he can.
- Oh, God, Alex!
There's an entirely different world beyond that black hole... a point where time and space as we understand it no longer exists.
We will be the first to see it, to explore it, to experience it.
Damn it all, Dan! If we wait for Alex, we may be too late.
Don't you see?
He's hypnotized by that man.
- Vincent.
- Yes, Captain?
Tell Kate we want her back here fast, with or without Alex. Tell her why.
Reactors on.
He's going to do it.
He's going to do it!
He's really going to do it.
He'll kill us all if you don't get us outta here now, Holland.
He wants us out there to monitor his flight. We still have time.
You're gambling with our lives, but you're not gonna gamble with mine!
Shut up, Harry!
- Alex.
- R squared.
- Alex! Could I have a word with you?
- B plus...
B squared... over A squared, sine squared, data...
Do you remember what we were talking about the other day?
- We've gotta get out of here.
- I'm staying.
- Shh!
- Reinhardt is a murderer.
- What?
Yes. Those creatures...
Those aren't robots. They're...
They're humanoids. They're... They're what's left of the original crew.
What's wrong, Miss Kate?
You look ill.
Kate's upset because I've elected to stay with the Cygnus.
- I hope she's electing also to stay with us.
- No, I...
- What changed your mind?
- I'm not. I, uh...
The right moment to go into the black hole is now.
What are you doing?
He would be dead by now.
They all would be dead.
It was the only way to keep them alive.
One of my greatest achievements.
But you told us the crew had left the ship.
Some cause must have created all this.
But what caused that cause?
Come on, Kate.
Let's get you out of here.
Maximilian!
Alex!
You shouldn't have done that!
He was a good man.
Protect me from Maximilian.
If there's any justice at all, the black hole will be your grave.
Take the young lady to the hospital.
You're cleared for take-off, Captain.
Dr Durant and Dr McCrae
chose to remain aboard.
I told you! Alex bought Reinhardt's theory hook, line and sinker.
Dr Durant is dead.
Maximilian killed him. They are taking Dr Kate to the hospital.
Vincent, get old Bob to show us the quickest way there.
Maximilian?
Bring us about.
All right. We may have just enough time.
Don't wait too long.
Get off before the gravity pull is too strong, no matter what.
- Look, Dan, what if...
- No matter what, Charlie!
I wish you a safe voyage home, Mr Pizer.
Yeah, well, just make sure you get aboard in one piece!
The time has come to liquidate our guests.
Go, go.
- Keep coming, old-timer.
- You don't have to wait for me.
Fire thrusters.
That madman is headed straight for the black hole.
- What'll we do?
- We wait.
Hurry.
Charlie, Kate's okay.
We're on our way.
Well, it's about time.
How close can we cut it?
Tell the sentries to fire on any humanoids between Medical and Palomino.
- They're on to us.
- Well, at least it got us this far.
Start down.
All right, Vincent.
Let's make this one an end run.
We'll catch them in a crossfire.
Way to go, old Bob!
- Are you all right?
- The first fightin'
I've done in 30 years.
I only wish it'd been Reinhardt and Maximilian out there.
Your crack unit, outwitted and outfought... by some Earth robot and that antique from storage!
We cannot endanger the Cygnus by exploding them too soon.
Give them distance.
Then blow them out of the sky!
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Dan.
Man the controls. Post Harry at the
hatch and give us exactly 60 seconds.
- Where are you?
- Side corridor near reception.
They got us pinned down, but we're gonna raise hell here in a second.
Start countin', Charlie.
Dan! Dan, are you all right?
Charlie, reversing last order.
Take her up now. Repeat, lift off.
- You heard the captain.
- You're pretty big on talking heroics, Harry. Let's see some.
- Oh, damn!
- Harry?
- Damn.
- You hit?
- My leg.
- How bad?
- Oh, uh... I-I think it's broken.
- Can you make it back to the ship?
- I think so.
All right, then. Harry, we're counting on you to make sure they don't get aboard.
- Right.
- Good.
- Way to go, Charlie.
- Hyah!
What's that idiot trying to do? Harry!
Oh, no.
Blow it apart before it hits us! Fire!
I should've known he was all talk, no guts, and locked him up.
- He may have done us a favour,
Charlie. At least we're alive.
- And where there's life...
I'm sure that's not what he had in mind.
He was trying to save his own skin.
There is a saying that you can't unscramble eggs.
A penny's worth of philosophy right now isn't gonna buy us out of this now, Vincent.
- A good offence is the best defence.
- And what?
Go after Reinhardt and turn the ship around? It's too late for all that.
- There is an alternative.
- The probe ship.
Vincent, you're a genius.
- A meteorite struck the ship, Captain.
- Let's go, let's go. Come on.
- Go.
A whole storm of them, Captain.
The black hole's dragging them in too.
We'll have to try the main corridor!
Get down!
Hang on, Kate.
Get down, Charlie!
- I got you, Bob.
- Let go, Captain! Save yourself!
- We've gotta keep moving!
- He's frozen.
- Come on! Hurry!
- All right, Charlie! Move it!
Keep going!
Increase power to maximum!
We are going through!
It's over. The storm's over.
Maximilian!
Prepare the probe ship.
Maximilian!
Help me! H-Help me!
Fools!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Help!
Listen, somebody!
H-Help me. Help. Help.
Vincent!
All light.
- We have to go.
- No. No, I can't make it.
My hover stabilization's gone.
My main circuit's blown, and both back-ups are failin'.
You can make it.
It's no use, Vincent.
My useful days are finished.
But part of me goes with ya.
We'll never be obsolete.
Carry on the tradition.
We're the best.
- Charlie!
- Help!
- No!
- Help!
- We better get the hell off!
The whole ship's breaking up!
- Everybody, sit tight.
Hang on! Lift-off!
Gravity force field is on!
Controls not responding.
Captain, the ship has been programmed.
To Reinhardt's course.
You mean we're going into the black hole?
- Yep.
- Let's pray he was a genius.
In, in, in, through, through, through... and beyond.
In, in, through, through, through and beyond.
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help, help, help, help me, me!
Life? Life? Life? Life?
Life forever.
Reinhardt murdered my father, my father, father.
Where is he? Reinhardt murdered, murdered, murdered... murdered, murdered, murdered, murdered...
The black hole is pulling us in, pulling us in, pulling us in.
We could also be dead, could also be dead...
Be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead.
We're the best. We're the best.
We're the best. We're the best.
Vincent. The best, best, best, best, best.
We're the best. The best.
The best, the best.
- Christmas morning, Christmas morning.
- Our mission's finished.
- It's pulling us in, pulling us in.
- Christmas morning. Christmas...
- We are the best.
- Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Engleberg.
- Let me see it.
Wait a second.
Glad to see you're still in training, Englebuns.
Keep it up, Stein.
Hey, Jose, Miguel.
Are you clods gonna sit on your butts all day... or are we gonna play some ball?
- We're waiting for the coach.
- To hell with the cruddy coach!
We gotta practice.
I know who he is.
Get ready to shit.
- Who?
- Not Buttermaker?
Worse. Mr. Manning.
Not Mr. Manning from the high school.
He's a mean dude.
Pushed our brother off the high dive for not knowing how to swim.
I hear he threw a basketball at a kid's face.
Busted his nose, blood all over the place.
And then he made the kid wipe it up.
Whatever you do, do not look into right field.
Look alive, gentlemen.
Take your seats.
Now, let's begin.
Gentlemen, we have a serious game coming up... in between a double-header at the Houston Astrodome.
We'll be in a professional arena.
We'll be in front of a lot of people.
The winner of this game will play a team in Japan.
Gentlemen, I expect to be prepared to win this game.
- Tanner Boyle?
- Here.
Timothy Lupus?
- The Looper ain't here.
- Where is he?
Looper broke his leg skateboarding.
Miguel Agilar?
Speak up, son.
Up, up! Atta-boy.
- Jose Agilar?
- Here.
Have you got something in your mouth, son?
Gum.
Did I give anyone permission to chew gum?
- No, sir.
- I'm gonna make this very simple.
If you want anything...
I don't care what it is... you come to me and ask my permission beforehand.
In other words, gentlemen... don't... assume anything.
That way you won't make... an ass out of you or me.
Who sent this guy? Hitler?
What's your name, son?
- Elton.
- Elton what?
John.
Do you have something to say to the group, Elton?
Then I suggest you pick up your stuff and get your ass out of here.
Well, what for?
Move it, Elton!
I said move it, now!
Jesus!
I don't want you back on this field till you can act like a ballplayer.
- Ahmad Abdul Rahim.
- Here.
Why don't we just make that "Andy"?
Make things a little easier?
- Andy?
- Good.
- Hey, what's going on?
- That guy kicked me off the team.
Gentlemen, I'm going to add another word to the board.
Let's see the bike, Kelly.
Son, I suggest you take...
- Now, son...
- You talking to me?
I want you to get...
- Cool!
- All right!
Hey, coach, take a walk!
You've been fired!
'Nough! 'Nough!
You listen to me!
You hear me?
I said listen to me!
You get off this field!
Shut up and sit down!
You'll never make it to Houston without a coach!
You come back here, or I'll break every bone in your body!
Come back here!
Hey, Big Looper.
Engleberg's here too.
Here he is now.
Hey, Big Looper, what's going on?
See your picture yet?
My dad took this last season.
We just had it blown up.
- Great shot, huh?
- Big Looper makes a big play.
Tanner's got something else.
An official Bears autographed ball.
It's the only one in existence.
See, it's got everybody's name on it.
Thanks.
Everyone talks about how they wish you were going with us.
You mean if we’re going. We still don't have a coach or a pitcher.
What about the prize?
The game in Japan?
Who wants to go to Japan, anyway?
The food's terrible.
Looper... if we win the prize, will you go with us next time?
Yeah.
- Hey, man!
- Where have you been?
Hey, I hear you guys are still trying to get to Houston.
But now they won't let us go without a coach.
Are you still looking for a pitcher?
'Cause I got one for you.
Why? Are you gonna play?
Play with you turkeys?
You're kidding.
- Well, who's the pitcher?
- Yeah, who is it?
- You've never heard of him.
- What's his name?
Carmen Ronzonni.
Come on, you guys.
You can do it. You got rhythm.
Yeah, just move a little bit more.
Come on. The race ain't over yet.
Way to go, Rudi! Is that right!
All right. But you gotta move a little bit too.
Nice lookin' bunch of boys.
- Hey, come here for a second.
- Hey, Rudi, come here.
Hey, guys. This is Carmen.
Come on over here for a minute.
He played baseball back east.
Yeah, heavy action back east, man.
By way of introduction, I'm your basic versatile ball-thrower.
You see, like, all you guys have heard of Catfish Hunter, right?
Well, okay, then.
Here is the Cat.
Man on first.
Watch the head moving.
Back like this, and in.
Catfish Hunter.
You want Luis Tiant?
You got this.
Luis Tiant.
You got a real sharp pitcher there.
That's really where I'm coming from.
Jews, Spicks, Niggers and a Wop that throws air balls.
Tanner, come on.
Ogilvie, Rudi, come here.
Hey, Kelly, what's this kid all about?
I don't want to pound the little one, but I can't go for the attitude.
- Don't worry. Tanner's cool.
- Well, I can't go for it.
What about you, Kelly? Did you change your mind about playing?
- Yeah.
- Get down!
- All right!
- Way to go!
- But why did you change your mind?
- I got my reasons.
Hey, you dumb jackasses, we still need a cruddy coach!
Hey, how bad do you guys want to play that game in Texas?
Well, we want to go to Japan.
If you really want to play, all chicken shits go home.
- We've got a coach.
- Listen to Kelly, man.
- Who is it?
- I'm looking right at him.
- Eastland?
- Oh, my God!
You mean Lester?
The walking bimbo?
He's so dumb, he can't even talk!
Like I said, Tanner, all chicken shits go home.
Now, who's with me?
What are we gonna tell our folks?
That we got an idiot for a coach?
- That's crazy!
- They'll never buy it!
Wait a minute.
We'll tell them the truth.
Tell them the truth?
- So, listen, who is this fellow?
- Oh, you mean Coach Eastland?
He's been with
Parks and Recreation for years.
- This coach...
- Lester.
- Lester what?
- Eastland.
Eastland? Didn't I have a kid named
George Eastland in class one year?
I don't know.
Listen, have you heard anything about Mike's new coach?
- No. There's a new coach?
- Do you think he's a good coach?
Oh, sure. He's been around ball fields all of his life.
That makes him a good coach?
Who's going with you as a chaperone?
- Coach.
- Coach who?
Eastland.
- Have you ever heard of him.
- No, I haven't.
When are we gonna meet him?
Well, when we leave.
You can drop me off there.
We're gonna leave from his house.
- How much did he say you need?
- Twenty-five dollars?
Maybe a little more, huh?
I suppose so.
I could run into a little trouble.
- Well, how much?
- About 15.
But, honey, $15 is not very much money for you to be gone for a week.
- How are you gonna live and eat?
- Let him starve.
Oh, Darrel, will you please?
About 20.
Seventy-five or eighty.
Four dollars.
For both of us.
How's he doing?
I got him to say,
"Hello. How are you?"
Well, how about, "Glad to meet you"?
It's a possibility.
Hello. How are you?
All right. Well, bye.
Hello. How are you?
Hey, Coach, we're here!
Hello. How are you?
I'm Fred Engleberg.
This is my wife Nancy.
I guess you know Michael.
You take care of him for us.
Hello. How are you?
Hello. How are you?
Wow! Is this it?
This is it, man.
All right!
Hello. Hello. How are you?
Bye-bye.
- Take care, you hear?
- Give me a hug.
- Bye, Mom. Be cool.
- Call us if you need us.
Grab my bag, Tanner.
Take care of yourself.
Come on, get in.
Oh, wow!
Good-bye!
- Let's jam.
- Yeah.
Good-bye.
- Look out, Astrodome, here we come!
- Watch out, Texas!
Hey, are you sure you know how to drive this thing?
Listen, dude. I'm from Van Nuys.
I was born to drive.
Where'd you guys get this van, anyway?
- I got a friend.
- Yeah, he owed us a favor, see?
So, this is your friend's van?
Well, like, he borrowed it from another guy.
Well, who's the guy?
Oh, some dude who's out of town for the week.
My friend says, if we return the van in a week, we got no problem.
In other words, we're riding in a stolen vehicle.
We're going to the joint, man!
Let's look at the positive side.
Recent FBI figures estimate... that only 20 percent of all car thieves are ever apprehended.
Only 14 percent in the first week that the theft occurs.
So at least the odds are in our favor.
Tell that to the guy behind us.
I knew it! Now we're going to the joint for sure!
Miguel, if you spit on me one more time...
Hey, can we be cool about this thing?
Now, it would help if one guy did the looking.
What's he doing?
He's not doing anything.
Just driving.
I know what he's doing!
He's calling in our license... and he's making reservations at the joint!
Because that's where we're going!
We're going to the joint!
- No, we're not!
- Hold it, Tanner!
He's pulling alongside.
He's making his move.
All right. Be cool.
All right! We did it!
Hey, you guys!
Will you listen for a second?
Now, do you guys want to be real major league about this... or do you want to act like some small-time assholes?
All right now, here's how they do it.
Everybody tosses what they got into one fund.
Except for a couple of bucks... personal dough, you know... for toothpaste, towels,
Trojans, or what have you.
And then we elect a treasurer... and he watches over the books and pays the bills for the whole team.
You guys want me to be treasurer?
Okay, fine.
- I want Ogilvie.
- Yeah, Ogilvie.
- Ogilvie would probably be better.
- Yeah, he's honest too.
Okay, you want Ogilvie? Fine.
- Let's all put it in the hat.
- All right.
- Save a couple of bucks.
- How much?
- We got plenty to get to Houston.
- I still don't like the idea.
- One, two...
- Count that again.
Hi. My parents sent me in.
They're in the van there.
- We'd like to rent a room.
- A double?
- Yeah. How much is that?
- It's gonna cost you $24.
Let me check with my dad.
Hey, Dad!
- Is $24 all right?
- How many rooms?
One room, Dad.
- Get it.
- We'll take it.
How come your folks didn't come in?
Well, ever since the big fire... they've been quite self-conscious about showing themselves in public.
I mean, how much can plastic surgery really do?
- Come on, move it, Ahmad!
- I'm moving.
Don't push me.
- I call that bed!
- Hey, this is cool!
- Oh, no! We can't even use it!
- What's wrong?
It's being sanitized. They've got it blocked off with paper.
Oh, great!
Let's call the Colonel!
Is this the only other bed in here?
How are we all gonna sleep here?
- I'm gonna sleep in this bed.
- Hey, I called that bed!
Hey, nobody called nothing, man.
I called it right when I came in, you dumb Wop!
- That's it.
- Fight!
Hey, he didn't mean it, all right?
Knock it off.
He didn't mean it.
Aw, take the bed!
Who needs it?
I'm going out to get something to eat.
Does anybody want to come?
Hey, what do you mean, biscuits and Cole slaw are extra?
Hey, how are you doing?
Sorry. I've got to see your ID.
- What for?
- You've got to be 21.
Hey, what am I gonna do?
Drink it?
- I'm sorry. That's the law.
- Jesus!
When you're 21, you've been there and back.
How do they expect us young guys to learn anything?
Really, I don't.
- Shut the damn door!
- I'll get you!
You're in the way!
All right, kiddies, it's library hour.
I got three Playboys.
Now, who wants one?
Give me one!
Come on, now!
- Come on, right here!
- You got it!
All right! We got one!
All right now, we got one more!
Come on, Carmen, please!
Come on, Carmen!
I love it!
Oh, wow!
Hey, Toby, where'd Kelly go?
He said we were acting like idiots, and he just took a walk.
He looked kind of strange, though.
Hey, that's his style, you know?
The last of the Lone Eagles.
Charles Lindbergh,
James Dean, Kelly Leak.
Yeah, but who's this guy he knows in Houston?
Hey, just some guy he used to know.
Don't worry, now.
Kelly's cool. He's cool.
Boys...
I haven't a thing to say.
You played a great game.
All of you.
A great game.
I guess we just can't expect to win 'em all.
I'm going to tell you something
I've kept to myself for years.
Tanner, would you shut that thing off?
None of you ever knew George Gipp.
That was long before your time.
But you all know what a tradition he is at Notre Dame.
And the last thing he said to me...
"Rock," he said...
"some time when the team is up against it... and the breaks are beating the boys... tell 'em to go out there with all they've got... and win just one for the Gipper."
"I don't know where
I'll be then, Rock," he said.
"But I'll know about it... and I'll be happy."
Well, what are we waiting for?
Oh, no, Coach Eastland's one of the greatest drivers of all time.
He's always talking about safety and everything.
- He's really a great driver.
- Come on!
Shh, would you? I'm on the phone.
Anyway, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you when I get home, okay, Mom?
Finally!
All right. Nice to see you.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Hey, please, no!
Won't your mother be disgusted when she finds her son is busted.
Footprints on the dashboard upside down.
Won't she scream in your ear when she finds you with that beer.
Grinnin ' and stumblin ' all around.
Come on!
Kelly, could we make a stop?
I gotta go to the bathroom.
It happens!
Come on, Engleberg!
Wow, what an emergency!
- All that equipment!
- And jackets. Look at that!
My time and distance charts say we should be in Houston by Thursday.
So we'll rent a room and get some sleep before we go to practice.
- Why are they staring at us?
- Anybody got a peace pipe?
Hey, be cool.
Do you play baseball?
He wants to know if we play baseball.
Yeah, we play occasionally.
You know, here and there.
We're playing the Dome this Sunday.
I think that's about it.
We play baseball too.
- Let's go, Tanner!
- All right, Tanner!
- Come on, Tanner!
- Let's get a home run!
Come on, Tanner!
- This one's going out of the park.
- Let's get a home run!
- Come on, Tanner!
- Let's go!
This one's going out of the US of A!
All right! Yes!
Run!
Lucky play!
- Wow!
- Good try, Tanner!
- Off the rock?
- Aw, they got the break.
Take away your rock, and you got nothing!
Let's go!
Go get him!
We can whip these guys!
Let's go!
It's all right.
Come on, man!
You got two more!
This guy can't pitch.
Come on, you're gonna stick this thing out!
- All right!
- Come on, Ahmad! It's cool!
- Let's go!
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't get mad.
- Come on, Engleberg!
Go, Engleberg!
Go! You got it!
I guess that's what they mean by the home field advantage.
- Talk about luck.
- Come on, you guys, let's get 'em!
Hey, Engleberg, come here.
There's something that me and you gotta talk about.
And that's signals.
Signs. All right?
Now, one means fastball.
Two, curve.
Three, slider. Four, knuckler.
Five, sinker. Six, change-up.
Seven, screwball.
And eight, dipsy-doodle.
Now, if you want something like an intentional walk... then you just yell,
"Intentional walk"...
'cause nobody gives a shit about that, anyway.
Have a good game.
All right!
Hey, batter, batter!
Come on, Carmen, let's go.
Hey, batter, batter, swing!
Sorry about that.
Hey, I thought you said you could pitch!
Yeah. Come on, just throw it down the middle. Trying to kill him?
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
Really.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean...
Hey, fellas, I said I was sorry.
Hey, you guys, listen.
He's not doing it on purpose.
- He just needs more warm-ups.
- He's just a cruddy pitcher!
Hey, listen, everything's cool.
It's cool. I'm serious.
Are you crazy? You wanna get killed?
You told me you could pitch.
Hey, no rosin, stinkin' field, no warm-ups.
Bullshit!
Shit, Carmen.
- Hey, batter!
- Let's go!
Come on, get the ball!
Throw it in!
Relay!
Come on, get it, Miguel!
- Relay!
- Throw it in!
- Come on!
- Hey, batter!
Let's go. Batter up.
Come on.
Couldn't you throw it a little harder, please?
They're hitting every one you throw.
Come on, you guys!
Look alive!
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Engleberg!
Carmen, try to get at least one guy out.
Come on, we got him.
Great!
It went in the graveyard!
- Forget it!
- Terrific, Carmen!
Looks like we've been scalped.
- Anybody got change?
- We've got money.
I've got money if anybody wants to borrow some.
"Dear Looper, Ronzonni makes me sick.
He can't even pitch.
Nobody thinks we can win.
Your pal, Tanner Boyle.
P.S., I saw a good movie the other night.
You'd like it."
Hey, Kelly, can we make another stop?
Engleberg, can't you just...
I can't control things like this.
Hey, you guys, there's the Dome!
Oh, man!
We're gonna be playing in that?
Hey, don't worry.
They're probably just a bunch of dirt farmers.
Couldn't throw the ball to save their grandmother.
Tell me about it.
Work, work, work!
Together!
Do it together!
Try to stay together!
And stop! All right, you got a big game coming up.
You're gonna do it together!
Are you gonna win it?
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Arms up!
Hey, how are you doing,
Mr. Orlansky?
Call me Sy, please.
Well, they're looking real good, aren't they, Sy?
- Where the hell is the other team?
- They'll be here any time now.
Listen, I understand they got some tough players out there.
They got some tough leagues in California.
- They should have been here by now.
- They'll be here any time now.
- Carl!
- What?
Listen, Sy, I just want to tell you how much we appreciate... you getting us in your organization, getting us this Astrodome game.
I just want you to know you're gonna get your money's worth.
- Carl?
- Sir.
What time are the Bears supposed to get here?
- This morning, as far as I know.
- It's noon now!
Listen, Morrie, I don't want any problem here.
I got people to answer to. You get a team here tomorrow, latest!
- Yes, sir.
- We'll get right on it.
Just as long as I don't have a problem, Morrie.
- That's all I ask.
- No problem. No problem at all.
I can't afford to wait on this other team any longer.
I want you to get hold of El Paso and see if they're still available.
Well, what about the Bears?
Hell, he'll never know the difference.
Hey, how about it?
It's cool.
Hey, guys, come on.
- Thank God.
- I'm going right to bed.
- Come on, Engleberg.
- Oh, God, I'm tired.
Do you have any idea who owns that van out front?
Let's see. If I'm not mistaken, it belongs to a ball team.
What kind of ball team?
A ball team of midgets... what they looked like to me.
If you ask me, the ball team is clean.
I don't have no trouble from the little people.
But then again, you know,
I can't be sure.
Oh, my God!
What in the hell is this?
All right, officers, let's get the kids right in here.
It's all over now.
We're going to the joint for sure.
Come on!
Why don't you sit down so I can talk to you, okay?
Hey, folks, can you knock it off, please?
Can you knock it off a little?
Okay, I know from Mr. Ogilvie here that you're late for practice... so I'm gonna make this as short as I can.
First of all, who was responsible for driving that van here?
What'd you guys do?
Take turns or something like that?
Okay, we'll get back to that later.
Who does that van belong to?
Okay, fellas, here's what we're gonna do.
We'll run a tracer on that vehicle to find out if there's a problem.
I'm gonna ask that everybody remain here in the lobby... till we get this thing straightened out.
- Why?
- Give me a break, man!
- What did we do?
- One last question.
Who's your chaperone here?
- You mean our coach?
- Yeah, your coach.
- Who is he?
- He's not here right now.
Get him.
- Right now?
- Right now.
- Where's he gonna go?
- What's he gonna do?
- What about lunch?
- Lunch?
We're gonna have lunch in the joint, because that's where we're going!
The joint! God!
Hey, thanks a lot.
Hey, Michael!
Hey, Michael Leak!
Michael?
Kelly?
Yeah. What's going on?
Not much.
What are you doing here?
Playing baseball with a team called the Bears.
- Got a game out here.
- In Houston?
Yeah.
I thought I'd be a nice guy and stop by and say hi.
That's great.
It's just a game.
No, I mean it's great that you stopped by.
Your cigarette.
So you're part of a team, huh?
Yeah.
What position are you playing?
I'm playing left.
Left field, huh?
I look different, don't I?
How's your mom?
She's okay.
You look a lot like her.
So they say.
Come on, Mike! I'm late!
Hey, I'll just sort of split.
Take it easy.
Hey, Ruth, I want you to meet my kid Kelly from California.
Hey, no kidding?
- What are you doing out here?
- Just visiting.
That's great.
Come on, Mike. You promised.
Nice seeing you, Kelly.
Hey, listen, Michael.
We need a coach.
- What?
- The team. We need a coach.
Oh, hey, listen.
I'm working full-time here now.
- How long is it gonna take?
- The game's on Sunday.
Okay, you got a coach.
What else can I do for you?
The team's in trouble back at the hotel.
How can you get in trouble at a hotel?
You don't know the Bears.
Stop that!
Look, I can't do anything about it.
- We worked hard all season...
- Put out that butt, honky, now!
Give me a break, will ya?
Come on.
Can you help me out here?
Why don't you just go talk to her?
Please.
I'm Coach Leak.
Look, let's talk outside.
That's my old man.
Just so you know, I don't intend to stand in the way of their game.
Whatever happened on the road,
I take it you weren't with them.
Well, whatever happened, it's not my jurisdiction.
So long as they have an adult, the van checks out...
I figure let's get 'em to the game so they can have a good time.
All right. Say, you got tickets to the game?
- No.
- I'll see what I can do.
Oh! Thanks.
- Okay, take care of yourself.
- Yeah.
Everything's okay.
Dear Looper...
Nobody even knew that Kelly had a father.
I don't think they like each other.
Your pal, Tanner Boyle.
I don't know if anybody told you, but we really don't need a coach.
We just need somebody to go onto the field with us.
So, we're gonna warm up for a while and make sure we're in good shape.
Okay. I'm just gonna go on over here.
If you all need me, just holler.
- I'll hit some out.
- All right! Let's go!
Let's get 'em!
All right!
Come on, Carmen.
Right down the pipes.
That's a good pitch, Carmen.
Good pitching.
Come on, Carmen. Let's go.
Hey, fellas, wait.
Time out. Just a second.
- Hey, Kelly.
- Come on!
You know, I might be a little rusty.
Don't think I'm trying to bean you.
- Just throw the ball.
- Yeah.
- Here we go again!
- Come on! Let's get going!
I got it!
God! Are you trying to kill me over here?
Go for it, Jose!
- Thanks for not doing anything!
- What the...
How could I miss that?
Crud!
- Come on, Miguel!
- Get it!
Come on! Are we gonna be this good in the Astrodome?
Throw it to first!
Will you call the ball?
- I got it!
- You do not!
Get the ball, Feldman!
- Get the ball, Jose!
- It's your ball!
Get the goddamn ball, Feldman!
You get it! You hit it!
You turkeys can play by yourselves! God!
I'll get it!
Come on! Get it over, Carmen!
Let's hustle this.
- Come on, Tanner! Let's go!
- Small strike zone.
- Come on!
- Good practice, Carmen.
Right down the pipe! Let's go!
- Put it right in there.
- Come on, Carmen.
What are you doing?
He's got to play.
You spazzy Wop!
Jungle spaz!
What are you trying to do?
- Cool it, man!
- He can't even pitch!
We don't need you! Get out!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Leave me alone!
- Oh, God!
Oh, God! My nuts!
Get off of me!
Get off! It hurts!
Ah, my stomach!
Get off of my stomach!
I can't take it!
Get off of my stomach!
- Come on! Knock it off!
- Hey, you guys!
What do you say?
You done practicing yet?
I don't want to rush you.
I'm in no hurry.
Sir, I know things aren't looking all that sharp right now.
As a matter of fact, I'd say they're looking pretty piss poor.
Sometimes we're the Bad News Bears.
Sometimes we're just bad news, if you know what I mean.
Well, anyway, if there's anything you can do to straighten us out... we'd all appreciate it.
Yeah.
Well, why don't we get cleaned up and go get some lunch?
I'll see what I can do.
"When asked why they made the journey, one ballplayer said...
'We came for the Looper'... referring to their teammate who lies in a lonely bed... unable to attend the game."
All right!
Hey, you guys!
Now that we've got Coach Leak, what does this mean for the Toros?
Bad News for the Toros!
All right!
- They're not gonna let us play!
- They got another team!
What do you mean, they're not gonna let us play?
Wait a minute!
What are you talking about?
Look!
What's going on here?
We didn't show up in time, and they're not gonna let us play.
Hold my glove.
You guys wait here.
Come on! A little pepper ball in there, kid!
Very nice!
Hang onto that!
Great day, huh?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Couldn't be better.
The kids tell me you're the Budweiser guy.
Yeah. Here, have a beer.
We're sponsoring games like this all across the country now.
Greatest thing in the world for baseball.
Kind of making the American dream come true, huh?
I'm Mike Leak, coach of the Bears.
- Sy Orlansky.
- Good to meet you, Sy.
Nice bunch of little ballplayers you got there.
I've been watching them all morning.
Those aren't the Bears.
The Bears are over there.
You mean, those aren't the kids in the paper?
Those are the kids in the paper.
But these are the California champs.
No, those aren't the California champs.
There's the California champs.
I thought we were getting the California champs.
Well...
Hey, kid, tell your coach to come on over here, will ya?
- How are you doing there, Sy?
- Morrie, what's with the mix-up?
There ain't no mix-up, Sy.
We had to bring in another team
'cause the first team was a no-show.
They're standing right behind you!
- Where the hell's their coach?
- Coach? Right here.
Hi, Morrie.
I'm Mike Leak.
I've heard a lot about you.
Well, now... I just...
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
Here you go.
Have a beer, Morrie.
Morrie, come here a minute!
Tell El Paso to go home.
But, Sy, they just got here this morning.
Listen to me! Look at this.
The morning paper?
These kids come all the way out here on their own... to win the prize for their little friend.
That's a good story, Morrie.
People like a good story.
I want this team, Morrie.
The team in the paper.
Shouldn't be such a big thing, huh?
Catch you in the Dome, Morrie.
Is that who we're supposed to play?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I knew they'd be wimps.
I thought they were sending us bears, not pygmies.
Why don't you just shut your cruddy mouth, you redneck ass?
Why don't you make me, little man?
Hey, Tanner! Cool it, man!
We'll get 'em later.
Come on, man. Don't worry.
Nothing, twerp.
Yeah, look here!
Kids! You're gonna play!
But what about a place to stay?
We still don't have a place to stay.
Tanner, give Mr. Orlansky a fresh beer.
Leak, would you believe me if I tell you I want these kids to be happy?
I want you to be happy. I want the whole darned world to be happy!
Well, I don't know, Sy.
I've only known you a few minutes.
What would you say if I told you...
Anheuser-Busch is gonna put you all up personally?
Wow! Look at this!
- All right!
- Get down!
Look! Guys, look!
The Astrodome!
- Success!
- We got a color TV!
- Come on!
- Your room is bigger!
- Where are you?
- In 324!
You can see the Dome from our room!
Let's go!
Hey, Kelly!
Everybody's in 325.
Think! Think!
All right! Way to go!
Engleberg, with you it's gonna take a lot more than thinking... but we're gonna get it done.
Surround the ball.
Clear it.
Right at his chest each time.
Once more, Carmen.
Think.
Bad hop or anything.
That's it.
Back to the plate.
Try to always aim at the first baseman's chest.
Once more, Carmen.
Over to first, all right?
Right to his chest.
Charge it now. That's it.
Now throw it to first.
Good throw.
Back to the plate. That's it.
Get set now.
- Where you going if you get it?
- First!
Come on. Stay with it! Pick it up!
Let's see the throw.
Charge it. That's it. Come on!
Good throw. All right.
That's it. Now get set.
When you get the ball, take one and off this foot.
All right!
That's it. Stay with it.
Good arm. What do you say, handsome?
You wanna try it?
Let's go. Get on there. Get set.
Okay, that's it. Good arm.
- We got a champ there.
- Looking good.
Get set on the ball.
Come on, Kelly.
Let's go. Give it a try.
- Oh, I think I can do it.
- Come on.
What do you mean, you can do it?
Let's go. Give it a try.
Let's see your arm.
All right. Come on, Rudi.
Give it a shot. Let's go.
Stay down. Over the ball, right?
Get set for it. Watch the ball now.
Come on, Carmen. Knock it down here.
Wow!
One more time. Sense of playing together. Move the ball around.
That's it. Now over to first.
Come down here, Carmen.
- You wanna get two.
- Come on, Tanner. Hold onto those!
Come on. Get on it.
That's the way.
Come on, Tanner. That's it.
- All right! Nice catch!
- Yeah!
- We're moving it now. Let's go.
- All right!
You guys are doing great backing each other up.
We're cooking. Let's go.
Up! Good arm.
Good shot, Toby. Way to go.
- All right, Miguel! Nice catch!
- Good arm.
All right. Keep the ball in front of you. That's it!
This spells doom for the Toros.
Attack the ball.
Good try. Stay with it.
We're gonna make a shortstop out of you if it's the last thing we do.
All right!
- All right!
- Nice catch!
Now, look.
We're all using only one hand.
We gotta use two hands when you catch.
Two hands. And you want to step into the ball when it's in the air... so you're catching and throwing in the same motion.
You catch and throw in the same motion, right?
One-handed, you drop the ball.
You can't handle it well.
That's why you have two hands.
Come on, Toby.
Come in here and field some.
You hit them out.
And get rid of the cigarette, for Christ's sake.
- Tell me about the catcher.
- Oh, that's Chip Roberts.
He was voted most valuable player three years in a row.
What about that man who just slid into second base?
That's Mick Fincher. Very fast.
Stole 35 bases last season.
Thank you. You've been very helpful.
That's okay.
Do you need anything else?
Uh, no, this is plenty. Yes.
Well, are you gonna stay in Texas long?
'Cause we'd really like to show you around some.
I'm sorry, but we leave right after the game.
But thanks anyway.
- Bye!
- Bye-bye. I'm in love.
Nice of you to stop by, Ogilvie.
Where you been? What's cooking?
Well, under normal circumstances...
I would pray for rain, except it doesn't rain in the Astrodome.
- That good, huh?
- Last season they were undefeated.
Eighteen to zero.
Mr. Leak, Ronzonni's getting wilder all the time.
He says he's caught between his
Catfish Hunter and his Warren Spahn.
Yeah? We'll have to help him out.
Carmen, throw me that ball.
Huh? Oh, you mean just throw it?
Yeah. Throw it in here.
It appears to be all right, doesn't it?
Let's see it again.
- Come again. One more.
- Hey, come on.
Come on. Just hit me right here in the glove once more.
- Come on.
- All right.
Now, listen.
Cut out the bullshit windups.
Forget about Warren Spahn and Catfish Hunter.
I want to see you throw the ball like Carmen Ronzonni.
Step up there and throw the ball.
Come on, Mike. Get down there.
Give him a big target.
Just look at the glove and throw the ball.
That's all it is.
Throw the ball right into the glove.
- All right!
- See? That's it. Come on.
Come on. Just throw the ball right to... Big target now, Mike.
Always give him a good target to throw to.
Hey, baby!
- All right? Keep practicing that.
- All right!
- Give him a good target each time.
- That's great!
You're getting it now.
Come on, Rudi. Attack it.
Back him up. That's it.
- That's it.
- Good throw.
Come on. That's it, Miguel.
That a boy.
All right.
What's with the cigarette bit?
That's it. Stay with it!
Come on, Ahmad.
That a boy.
You know, you look silly.
Who do you think you are, my father?
You angry at me for something?
Because if you’re angry at me for something, I wanna know about it.
What do you want from me?
You wanted me to be the coach of this team, so I'm the coach.
Now you want to call this whole thing quits or what?
Put out the cruddy cigarette, Kelly!
- Tell me what you want me to do.
- I want nothing!
You want me to go?
- Come on, Kelly. Put it out!
- Kelly, just put out the cigarette.
Listen, I am not out here for my health. I'm out here for you.
Yeah, you sure?
- Come on, you guys. Back up.
- You don't do that to me!
- You got that? You don't do that.
- Come on! Let's hustle!
Get out of the way before you get hurt.
Did you hear that?
I said, no one does that to me.
- Come on! Move your asses! Let's go!
- Hey, I don't need you.
- You hear that? I don't need you!
- All right! Good catch!
- I don't need any of you!
- Good throw, Ahmad!
- Go!
- Do you hear that? I don't need you!
- And I don't need any of you!
- We're moving now. We're cooking.
Come on, you guys. Let's go.
Hey, you're Kelly Leak, aren't you?
I hear you’re pretty good.
They think they're great 'cause they got their pictures in the paper.
Everyone knows they're just a bunch of flaming Hollywood faggots.
Move.
Yes, sir.
Have you seen their coach?
Yeah, now they got a big faggot to go along with all them little fag...
You're dead, faggot!
You're a dead man.
And the temperature today hit a high of65 degrees.
- Tonight's low will be 45.
- Anybody seen Kelly?
- His stuff is still in his room.
- Well, is he playing or not?
Hey, don't worry about Kelly.
He's cool. Don't worry about him.
- Shut up. We're next. Quiet.
- Yeah, we're next.
Sunday's charity game at the Astrodome is almost a sellout... but that doesn't seem to bother a group of boys from California.
Sheila Lansing has the story.
I'm standing in a downtown hotel... where the California champs, the Bears... are preparing for their big game
Sunday at the Astrodome.
- All right!
- Yeah! Whoa!
I talked with some of the players about the game. Ahmad?
- Yeah! All right!
- Ahmad!
How do you feel about playing in such a big place as the Astrodome?
Well, Sheila, we've worked hard all season... and I think we've got what it takes to do the job.
Do I sound like that?
Our base running's come along real good... so I'd have to say that
I'm real positive about the game.
We're expecting a real good game.
- All right!
- I sound stupid!
Hey, I'm next.
Next, I talked to right fielder
Miguel Agilar.
- All right, Miguel!
- Whoo!
What happened? I was next.
How do you feel about playing in the Astrodome?
This is Sheila Lansing in downtown Houston.
Good shot.
Listen, hard ass.
You stuck me with a bunch of kids... down at the hotel who say they can't play without you.
What do you wanna do about that?
Huh? Are you gonna play, or are you gonna quit or what?
Don't you think your friends have a right to know?
Look, I'm sorry I got hot at you.
This whole thing's about something else.
Maybe we should think about that.
Maybe we should deal with the fact we're just a couple of strangers.
You didn't recognize me at the plant.
You didn't know it was me, did you?
Listen, it's been a long time.
It's been eight years.
Do you know why I know it's been eight years?
Because on the day you left... you gave me this little blue bicycle.
I was five years old... this little punk kid.
You gave me the bicycle thinking if
I accepted it, I'd accept the deal.
Well, you were wrong.
I didn't accept that bicycle.
It's eight years old, it's untouched and it's still in my basement.
Listen, you wanna be your own man, right?
Well, you gotta remember one thing.
Being angry at me for the mistakes I've made... ain't gonna change what happened.
Maybe.
Tell me something.
If you didn't need a coach... would you have looked me up?
You should think about that.
Dear Looper, today is the game.
I hope we win, but it will be hard without Kelly.
Your pal, Tanner Boyle.
- Miguel, what's it like?
- Yeah, what is it like?
What about Kelly?
Did anyone talk to him?
Hey, he'll be here.
Don't worry.
Hey, Bears, you got five minutes.
- Well, when's he coming?
- Soon.
How do you know that?
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys play baseball all the time, don't you?
But not without Kelly.
- How can we play without him?
- The same way you play with him... the best that you can.
Come on. Let's go.
Put your chairs up.
Let's get this straight.
All we gotta do is concentrate on what we worked on.
And what we worked on was thinking, right?
We worked on using our heads.
That's where our skills are.
You're gonna use your heads at the plate and in the field on defense.
Before Ogilvie reads off the lineup, anybody got anything they wanna say?
I got something to say.
Now, we all know that
Timmy couldn't come with us... but if we go out there... and win one for the Looper... he'll know about it, and he'll be happy.
Okay, Bears. Let's go!
Well, what are we waiting for?
- All right, Kelly!
- Way to go!
I knew you would be here.
What does this mean to the Toros?
Bad News for the Toros!
Let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen, there's a special... between-games attraction for you this afternoon.
The Houston Astrodome, along with the Anheuser-Busch Corporation... is presenting a special four-inning game... between the undefeated champions of Texas, the Houston Toros... and the pride of the West Coast, the California Bears.
Those are the kids I was telling you about from California.
Whoa!
Get them up!
Nice throw.
- Let's go!
- I'm never gonna make it!
Hold on there a minute, son.
- There you go.
- My God. You just saved my life.
All right!
Hey, Ronzonni! Let's go, boy!
Let's play ball!
Leading off for the Toros, second baseman Leon Watersag.
Strike!
Strike two!
Strike three! You're out!
- All right, Carmen!
- All right!
All right, you guys. We got one.
- I did it!
- You did it!
All right!
Way to go, Tanner!
Let's go! You can do it, Carmen!
You can do it!
Strike!
What do you say, Mac?
What do you say?
All right, Carmen.
Nobody gets on base!
Come on. Play it second! Second!
All right, Ahmad!
Way to use your head!
Frenchy, that a way to go!
What do you say, Frenchy?
- All right.
- There's a fast man on first.
Keep your eye on him, Carmen.
Take your time, Carmen. Bear down.
All right!
He's going!
- Where'd you get it, in the shin?
- Are you okay?
I hope he didn't hurt the baby bear!
Come on, guys.
Get back to your positions.
- Are you okay?
- Come on.
- Just let me play!
- All right. Wait a second.
- How's your leg? Is it all right?
- Yeah.
I don't want you to play hurt.
You sure you can play?
- Yeah.
- I could bring Ogilvie out here... and put him on short, huh?
Let's go.
- Okay, batter.
- Come on, Carmen.
Chip Roberts.
He can't throw him a fastball.
Carmen, number three, babe. Three.
You can't throw him a change-up, either.
A two-run homer.
At the end of one half inning, the score is the Houston Toros, two... the California Bears, nothing.
Way to go, Carmen. Way to pitch.
Way to use your head out there, Ahmad.
- We'll get it back. Let's go.
- Sure.
- Use your head up there, Tanner!
- The shortstop, Tanner Boyle.
Pitching for the Toros, Ed Simpson.
Hey, give him a toothpick.
- Aim at my shoelaces.
- Better shut up, you redneck.
Okay, boy. Come on, now.
Let's play now.
Shut up!
Come on, big fella!
Let's play ball!
- Dumb ass!
- Okay, come on! Let's go!
Come on, Tanner. Think!
Come on, now. Come on! Hustle!
You're out!
One out. The batter's center fielder
Ahmad Abdul Rahim.
All right, Ahmad.
Come on, man. Think!
- Give this guy a look.
- This guy ain't got nothing.
He's out!
All right, Michael.
You're the boss in there now.
- Be tough. Let's go.
- Hey, look what we got here.
You got a big enough target.
Don't pay attention to him.
Come on, Mike.
Run, you big lard ass!
- Out!
- All right!
After one inning, the score remains... the Houston Toros, two, the California Bears, nothing.
Give him that mask, Ogilvie.
All right. Big target now. Let's go.
Come on, Carmen. Burn it in there!
Ball four. Take your base.
- Oh, man, that was a strike!
- Same place, catch.
Bear down. Think. Throw strikes.
What is this, a baseball game or the Fourth of July?
That runs the score to the Houston
Toros, five, the Bears, nothing.
After an inning and a half, the Bears coming to bat.
Run it!
Stand up! Hold up!
Way to go!
Come on. You got one of the Marx Brothers up here.
Come on, Toby.
Now let's move them around.
Way to go! Way to hustle!
All right. One down, Kelly.
One out. Protect yourself.
- Fire them in there! Let's go!
- All right, Miguel! Come on!
- You're the boss!
- Come on!
Tag up!
Go!
He's coming home!
- Throw the ball!
- He's out!
Easy out!
All right.
And the score, after two complete innings... is the Toros, five, the Bears, nothing.
Okay, I'm sorry, but the game's called.
- We're out of time.
- Time.
Game is called.
- The game's not over yet.
- I'm sorry. It's over.
Let's go home, fellas. That's it.
Can they do that?
No, they can't do that. Hey.
Hey, you guys, where you going?
What about the Looper?
We're not finished!
- We had a four-inning game.
- Just a minute.
We have finished. We're out of time.
You didn't play it fast enough.
Don't play what fast enough?
A game is a game.
- The game is called. Who's ahead?
- He's ahead.
- You win the game.
- We won it!
All right!
- You said the game was set up.
- The game is over!
Come on. Let the kids play the game.
What are you shutting it off for?
We're not finished!
The game isn't over yet!
They said four innings!
- Hey.
- It's Bob Watson and Cesar Cedeno!
They told us we'd have four innings, but they only let us have two.
- We'll meet you in the park, Morrie.
- Up yours, Sonny.
- We'll settle this in the park.
- Up yours!
- You guys got a lot of pull here.
- Hell, let's get going.
Hey, you guys. Look at Tanner!
Look at Tanner. All right!
No! Take that!
Leave me alone! The game ain't over!
- Go, Tanner!
- Come on, Tanner!
I don't know.
Look at the little kid!
Leave me alone!
Go, Tanner! Go!
Come back. Come back here right now!
Come back here!
- This is terrible.
- Come on, Tanner.
Come on! Let the kids play!
Let them play!
It's the top of the third inning, the Houston Toros at bat.
With one out,
Scott York is on first base...
Les Kern at bat.
Here we go again. All right.
You're out! You're out!
Two and a half innings, the score remains... five to nothing.
You better back up, sucker!
I feel good!
- Strike!
- You feel good, huh?
Strike two!
Let's go!
I feel better than ever.
I run like a butterfly,
I sting like a bee!
I ran through second, and I'm standing on three!
You're a hitter now!
All right! Let's go!
The score after three innings... the Toros, five, the Bears, two.
All right, Carmen.
Come on. Let's go!
- Yeah!
- We're getting it going now!
We're getting it going! Yes!
Strike!
Come on! Watch the ball, will you?
- Keep your head up!
- Strike three! You're out!
That ball!
Somebody hit the ball, will you?
All right! Okay, calm down.
- Let's go! Run, damn it! Run!
- Safe!
Mr. Leak, Fincher on first again.
Time out!
Put the ball into your glove, right?
You just keep looking for a little bit of a signal.
When he leads off, tag him out.
- Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, Carmen!
Hold your breath.
All right. Get up! That's it!
- I got him!
- You're out!
He never ducked!
What a cheap, cotton-picking
California faggot trick!
Come on!
Keep alive out there!
In the bottom of the fourth, the score remains... the Houston Toros, five, the California Bears, two.
Last inning, you cruds!
Let's get them!
- All right!
- Let's get them!
- Come on, Simpson.
- Base running! Let's go!
Come on. What more do you want?
- All the way!
- You're a hitter! Let's go!
All right!
- You're out!
- Hold up!
Toby, in there, you go halfway!
If it goes through, take third.
Come on. This is supposed to be the home run team.
- Strike one!
- Kelly, you're the boss!
Come on, Kelly! Put me in!
Let's see something.
Let's go!
Hold up!
Way to go!
All right, handsome. Let's go!
- There's one!
- Strike one!
- I'm gonna hit it.

I'll turn it off right after the program's over.
- Program?
You know, I can remember when kids liked to have stories read to them.
They'd actually beg their parents, like their fathers, to read to these stories.
- Dad, you always start talking about that when I want to watch my program.
- It was a very big deal.
The fathers would read these exciting stories, and sometimes, adventure stories to them.
- This is my favorite program, Dad.
- And the kids, would brag to their friends about how their fathers would read these great...
- Dad, the other guys get to watch their programs.
- Kids used to like their parents, used to like them to read these marvelous...
- Dad.
Now let's see, now here's a story.
This is a story...
- There'll be monsters?
- This is a story a man could actually read to his...
- Yeah, okay Dad.
- Monsters?
Yeah, sure, monsters, listen.
Once upon a time, a long way from here, and a long way from now, there was a tiny village where everything, the houses and the carts, the bridges, and the barns, everything, all had points on them.
In fact, it was so full of points, that even the people had points.
The people, right there on top of their heads.
And it didn't seem strange at all because that's the way life was in the village.
That's the way it always had been.
And for all anybody knew, that's the way it always would be.
As you might have already guessed, the main activity of the village was making points.
And needless to say, business was brisk and the competition was competitive.

♪ And these are the people
♪ This is the town
♪ Where the people all stay
♪ This is the town
♪ And these are the people
♪ That's the way they wanted it
♪ That's the way it's going to stay ♪
- And while the farmers kept the villagers bodies nourished with pointed crops, the artist colony in the community, as in all communities, did their part to keep minds and souls filled with new points to view.
♪ This is the town
♪ And these are the people
♪ This is the town
♪ Where the people all stay
♪ That's the way they wanted it

- To be, or not to be.
That is the point.
♪ Everything's got 'em
♪ Everything needs one
♪ Couldn't be without one
♪ Everything has one
♪ This is the town
♪ And these are the people
♪ This is the town
♪ Where the people all stay
- It was a good life, a settled life, and the point was the point of it all.
You could look high, and you could look low, but you'd never hear any complaints on that Count.
Well, almost never.
♪ That's the way it's going to stay ♪
And then, one day, a very unusual thing happened in the village.
A little baby boy was born, a boy named Oblio.
Now, don't get the wrong idea.
The being born part wasn't usual.
Little kids were being born all the time in that village.
What was unusual was that Oblio, unlike any of the other babies born that day, or any other day, had no point.
He had no point at all.
- Hi, son.
Hi, Oblio.
- Well, hello there.
- Hi, how ya doin'?
- Fine, nice to see.
- Good, what's new?
- Same ol' sixes and sevens.
- Really?
Well, I have to...
- I guess you heard about them?
- Them?
- Them, yeah, they had a kid.
- That's nice.
- Kid's got no point.
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious.
Their kid's a kid who's got no point.
- You're putting me on.
- Would I lie to you?
- Well, I think that is wild.
- So, you see, Oblio was a kind of, involuntary, instant celebrity.
His uniqueness was, well, something that was noticed around the village.
Naturally, his parents couldn't help noticing, either.
- We have a lot to be thankful for, you know.
- He's a healthy little nipper, I'll say that.
- And he's happy.
- I'll be he'll be great...
- He has a wonderful disposition.
- Yeah, but he doesn't have a point.
- Maybe, maybe he'll grow one.
- But, he didn't.
No, as things turned out,
Oblio didn't grow any point at all, but it really wasn't so very noticeable.
As a matter of fact, in time, he took to wearing a cap, a pointed cap his mother made.
It kept his head warm, and it did make him look a lot more like the other ordinary kids in the village.
Just about the same time
Oblio got his new cap, he also got
- Arrow, Arrow.
You guessed it, the greatest dog in the world.

♪ Me and my Arrow

And then, one day after school, a very serious thing happened.
- Hey, let's choose up sides for triangle toss.
- I got Harry.
- Okay, then I want Fred.
- Okay, Richard.
- All right, then,
I'll take Oblio.
- Not him, he can't play, out.
- It was the Count's son, and that was the serious thing.
You see, the village Count was a very powerful man, and, frankly, not all that nice a guy, and the way things sometimes work out, a certain amount of that not niceness has rubbed off on his son.
He was liked, but he was not well liked.
- How come you said
I couldn't play?
- 'Cause you can't, so beat it.
- Always have before, me and Arrow.
- Hey, look, you're not playing, so just push on.
- That's not fair.
- Tough, triangle toss is for people with pointed heads.
Toss the triangle...
- We know how to play the game.
- Then run and catch it on your point.
- Everybody knows that.
- Yeah, but you got no point.
So, you can't play.
- We can play better than you can.
- You what?
- I said, we can play better than you can.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You're looking for some real trouble here.
- And I'll bet you we can beat you at triangle toss, too.
- Say that again.
- I said, "I bet we can beat you at"...
- Yeah?
Well, what do you wanna bet?
- Come on no point, what do you wanna bet?
- Bet ya anything.
- Oblio and the Count's kid are gonna duel.

Best two out of three catches, anything's fair.
- Holy cow, wow.
- Only rule is you gotta catch a triangle with your head, or your mutt's, in your case, Oblio.
The first man to catch two triangles wins.
Get the idea, Oblio?
So, long sucker.

- Yay, hooray for Oblio, yay.
- Thanks, but don't forget about Arrow.
Arrow was the...
- I won't forget Arrow, and I won't forget you either, round head.
- Now, why would you want to go say something like that for?
Remember, you were the guy who...
- I'll remember,
Oblio, and so will you.
My father will see to that.
- Hey, come on, it's just a dumb ol' game.
- A game, Oblio?
When my dad gets done with you, you'll wish this dumb ol' game had never been invented.
- If it's that important to you, then...
- Do you gather my meaning, Oblio?
- Predictably enough, when the Count learned of his son's defeat, he was furious.
As for the boy himself, as soon as he saw which way the wind was blowing, he just laid low and let his father's evil disposition lead the way.
- Would that it were not true.
You idiot, you pathetic fool.
I groomed you, how I groomed you.
I cultivated you like a rare flower, and for this?
No, by guile and foul deed
I laid the ground work for you to rule this miserable village one day, and rule you will.
I shall not be denied, but as long as that vile, little round person, that
Oblio languishes among us, your leadership credibility is shot.
We must rid ourselves of that contemptible little twerp, once and for all, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
Yes, you'll still rule one day, you useless nit because Oblio is finished.
You can bank on that.
- Now, the King, was a good-natured, harmless, old fellow, the kind who had weathered life in a rather middle groove, no great highs, no deep lows.
He was a decent, but very ordinary, man.
He was also a very ordinary ruler of other men.
- If it isn't the illustrious...
- My King, a word in your ear.
- Anything you say, my dear Count.
I was just relaxing with a couple of...
- Yes, I saw, King we have a problem.
- Well, that's hard to believe.
I thought all systems were go.
I mean, I always like to think that...
- King, the law of the land has been violated.
- Violated, the law of the land?
Why, why that's impossible...
- It is done.
- But there must be some mistake,
Why, the law of the land clearly states that everything and everyone must have a point.
That purely and simply is the law of the land.
Why, you can't violate a law like that in a place like this, just look around.
- You look around, my dear King.
The law is being violated, at this very moment.
For the sake of all the decent people, appropriate measures must be taken.
- Measures, measures?
My, my, measures on a grave charge like this would require my convening, my convening the tribunal.
- Exactly.
- My.
Now, now why do you want to go and create a problem like that?
- That's no problem, King.
That's a solution.
The problem was created when the law was violated.
In point of fact, by that little round-headed twit, Oblio.
- Oblio? Oblio?
But, I know him, why, he's a nice little boy.
I know his parents.
Why, it was my understanding that this Oblio was developing into a pretty decent little triangle toss player.
- So I gather.
He's also round, which, as you yourself know, is in direct violation of the law.
You may as well face it, my dear King, this Oblio is, literally, an outlaw.
- But that's incredible.
Wait a minute, he wears a nicely pointed hat.
That should Count for something, shouldn't it?
- No way, my King, we must convene a tribunal, a public tribunal, and so we shall, and then, after all the niceties are looked after, this Oblio will be neatly banished, forever.
- A tribunal? No, and for Oblio?
Why, isn't there any other way?
- The law is the law, King.
You cannot fight that.
- The law is the law, well, I never looked at it quite like that.
Very well, a tribunal it is, but I warn you Count, I won't have the boy railroaded.
- Railroaded?
- A turn of phrase, Count.
- While the Count was having a marvelous time, no matter how rotten he may have been ethically and spiritually and every other way, as a prosecutor, he was good, and as a stand-up performer, he was even better.
The way it all worked out, poor little Oblio never had a chance.
- And so, noble King, and good gentlemen of the tribunal,
I would only remind you that this law, so cherished a part of our tradition, was not enacted, nor is it being applied, for purposes of base persecution, or cruel harassment, good gracious no, the law was created to preserve and protect the sanctity, the integrity, the purity of our here, to for, unsullied life mode, and so it is, that this, this freak, this viper, Oblio, by his very existence here in our realm, only serves to...
- My dear, isn't the
Count absolutely too much?
- Well, I'm sure he's very good, but all the same, I can't help feelings sorry for little Oblio.
After all, he is...
- I just don't see how you could say that.
That's so, so sentimental.
Well, sure, he's little, but the law is still the law, and where would we be, my dear, if...
- But, to just sit here while those old men complacently let the little...
- Listen, neither one of us was born yesterday, and we both know if we let one of Oblio's kind stay, before long, the whole village will be crawling with...
- Psst, psst, my dear Count, isn't there some way or other little Oblio could just, sort of, stick around?
I mean, if he promised to keep his hat on all the time and didn't ever...
- In this stead my King, the law is most explicit.
We all agree that there has been a violation of law.
The violator is right here in our midst.
We can see that.
That is, as the fellow says, beyond question.
- Would it help if I promised to never ever play triangle toss again?
I mean, if that's what you're mad about Count, I could...
- No, gentlemen, the only question remaining is one of penalty.
Here, again, the law is crystal clear.
For such a grave breach, banishment, that is the order of the day.
- Yeah the Count's really pulling the chain on that weird little Oblio.
- How can you joke about such a thing?
I think a terrible thing's happening, and Oblio's such a lovely little boy.
- Yeah.
- You know, he's polite, and he's well mannered... - Well, he may be,
- but would you want your daughter to marry... - You're baiting me.
You're deliberately baiting me.
I will not be subject...
- Gentlemen, it remains beyond question that Oblio, by his mere rounded existence, stands in violation of the law.
Here, our duty is clear, but we would ill be serving the law to overlook an entirely new facet of the case.
In point of fact, Oblio was both aided and abetted by his flea-bitten canine.
- Hey, please, don't do anything to Arrow.
- Gentlemen, I charge this dog, Arrow, with criminal conspiracy.
- Honest, Arrow's innocent.
I did it by myself.
I did it, Arrow wasn't even...
- He is as guilty as Oblio himself, but what's more repellent about him, he's a disgrace to everything pointed.
No, gentlemen, this Arrow is not only a conspirator, he is also a traitor, and he, too, must be banished.
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Not bad.
- So, what's the latest?
- Well, you know.
- Wild trial?
- Well, if you've seen one...
- What about this conspiracy business with Sparrow?
- Arrow.
- Right.
- It could be a toughy.
- No, you really think so?
- Conspiracy's no laughing matter.
- Hard way to go, is it?
- Could be for someone like Arrow.
- You know, he doesn't look like the conspiratorial type, though.
- He's got a record long as his tail.
- That long?
- Yeah,
Chasing, night barking, they'll throw the book at 'em.
- Adios, Arrow.
- That's it.
- And so, it is my deeply unpleasant task to declare that this tribunal finds the boy, Oblio, guilty of living within our midst without a point.
For this grave violation of law, he is, from this day forward, banished to the Pointless Forest.
I might just parenthetically add, as our good Count so aptly put it, the law is the law, and as all of you know, without the law, why, why there would be no lawyers and without lawyers there...
Well, it just goes on and on.
- Deal with the dog, my lord.
- Yes, the dog.
Well, Arrow,
I must send you over, too, boy, involuntary conspiracy.
- Take them away.
- Now dear, I know how you hate to wear undershirts, but we don't know what the weather will be like, and this is a dangerous time of year for colds, so...
- Sure, Mom, great,
I'll wear 'em.
So will Arrow.
Don't cry, Mom.
- Well, I just don't want you to take a chill, little Oblio.
- It's just about time, dear.
You all set Ob?
Well, son, I hope you realize,
I mean, I hope you understand how distressing this is for your mother and me.
I just wish there was some way, don't get me wrong,
I believe in obeying the law and everything.
Anything else would be anarchy but, still, I wish there was some way this particular law could be...
- Sure,
Dad, I understand.
- Well, I just wanted you to know this, Oblio.
- Good luck, Oblio.
Good luck, Arrow.
- And, don't blame the
King too much, son.
He just did what he had to do.
Well, after all, it's his job.
Frankly, I wish there never was such a law in the first place.
Now that it's been used, it seems, well, it really seems unfair.
- How come nobody did anything about it before, Dad?
- It just never came up before, son.
- Oblio, here Oblio.
Here's a candy bar for you, for the road.
- Gee, thanks Mr. Candy Man.
- And, this, this is for Arrow.
- Hang in there, Oblio.
- Stay lose, Ob.
- Be seeing you, Oblio.
- Oblio, ol' man, here's a little something for you, just in case you need some change.
You know, you can never tell when you might need a couple of bucks to...
Well, anyway, you know.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Take good care of yourself, dear little Oblio, and eat well, and write to us when you can.
I mean, it doesn't have to be anything long, just a card to say you're fine.
Would you do that, for your poor mommy,
Oblio?
- Sure, Mom, don't worry.
We'll be okay, right Arrow?
Come on, boy, let's go.
- Go get 'em, Oblio.
- Stay in there, pile driver.
- Go straight Ob, you've got it wired!
- Good luck, kid.
- Goodbye, Oblio.
Goodbye, son.
- Goodbye, my little baby.
- Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Come on, Arrow, let's go.

Use the imagination, the view from the mind's eye.
You've got a creative little head on your shoulders there, son.
- I bet you can just picture this little Oblio and his dog right now.
♪ Me and my Arrow
On and on they went.
After a while, they even stopped looking back.
The village having long since faded in the distance, and the truth of the matter is they were really a lot more excited about what lay ahead of them than what they had left behind, and who wouldn't be?
No one had ever been to the Pointless Forest.
Yet, now, Oblio and
Arrow were going.
- Hey, Arrow, you think they'll be monsters?
I'd be just as happy if there weren't any monsters.
But, either way, no matter what happens, we've got to stick close together because we're really a team now.
Hey, you know what I hope?
I hope, oops.
Arrow!
Could this be the
Pointless Forest?
How can it be?
It's got to be.
But, if it is, how come everything's got a point?
The leaves are pointed.
The branches and twigs are too.
Everything.
Well, this is it, Arrow.
This is the beginning of the place we were banished to.
There's just one thing
I don't understand.
How are we suppose to get through this stuff to get in there.
It's so thick, it's like a jungle.
Good boy, Arrow, good boy.
Now, just follow me.
No, I'll follow you.
No, we'll go together.
That's the plan, we'll go together.
And whatever you do, don't leave me, Arrow.
- Oblio and
Arrow and just barely set out onto the road into the Pointless Forest when all of a sudden,
- Arrow, look, a man.
A pointed man.
Excuse me, sir.
We thought this was the Pointless Forest.
Quite right my boy, well noted, this is the place indeed.
By name, the
Pointless Forest.
- But what is a pointed man doing in the Pointless Forest?
- Listen to the lad, me pointed?
That's too funny.
You know, he's funny.
Me, a pointed man?
This news amuses me.
- But, sir, you're pointing right now, more than any...
- My boy, I'm not the pointed man you think I am.
I can point in every direction, sure, any fool can do the same, but a point in every direction, is the same as no point at all.
Would you argue the point,
I wouldn't, not on a bet, it never entered my mind.
- Suddenly, Oblio and Arrow were all alone in the Pointless Forest.
At first, everything seemed quite peaceful.
Oblio thought about the pointed man and wondered what his friends in the village would have said, if only they knew he had seen and talked to such a rare person.
Then, Oblio noticed how quiet it was.
Arrow noticed, too.
It was very quiet.
Then, little by little,
Oblio began to feel lonely.
- You know Arrow,
I was just thinking.
I mean, about that pointed man.
I don't know.
I think there's something a little funny about that man.
I mean, he's pointed, heck, he's always pointing.
Then he says he isn't a...
Arrow, hey Arrow,
I think I'm scared.
Hey, now what do you want to go and growl like that for?
Especially, when I told you I...
What is it, boy?
Wow, giant bees, run, Arrow, run for your life.
Arrow, what'll we do?
Wow.
Arrow, help!
What was that?
- I believe it was e flat, double style, extra fortissimo, don't you know it?
- Say, what's happening with you, boy?
You been goofing with the bees?
- Gosh, who are you?
- It's me, the Rock Man.
- I never saw a rock man before.
- Well, us stone folks are everywhere, just open your eyes and look around you.
- You mean there are more of you?
- Naturally, baby.
There's a whole family of us rock folk.
- Well, I was wondering if this is still the Pointless Forest.
- It isn't, Jack, they ain't nothin' pointless about this gig, just look around yourself, the birds singing sweet loves song to the trees, squirrels doing crazy digs all over the place.
Mother Nature, she watchin' over the whole scene, and dig me, taking it all in.
- Yeah, but...
- It's the here and now that I'm talkin' about, the smell of sweet life in the air.
It's the warm feel of the sun and the beat of music, just digging yourself.
- But, I can't see the...
- Well, you see what you want to see.
Tell me, did you ever see a dinosaur?
- No.
- Well, did you ever see a pterodactyl?
- No.
- Well, did you ever want to see a pterodactyl?
- I guess not.
- Well, that's it, you see what you want to see, and you hear what you want to hear.
- Gosh, Mr. Stone Man...
- It's Rock Man, Jim.
You gotta keep yourself in historical prospective.
- I mean Mr. Rock Man, well, you see, you're surrounding everything.
- Come on, boy.
Out with it, don't get yourself all racked up and jammed, you got a question?
Lay it on me, but let it out easy.
- It's just that everything's been happening so fast.
We were banished and then those bees.
- I can dig it,
I can dig it, yes.
Look, let me hip you to reality.
- I'd really rather know if this is still the Pointless Forest.
- Now, there you go again, pointless, that's the central issue of what I'm putting down for you cats.
- You gotta open your mind as well as your eyes, but first, you gotta get it together, you know, be cool, dig yourself.
Get the message?
Now, here's the lick.
You don't have to have a point to have a point, dig?
Now, I fear you've been getting some negative vibration from some place.
You gotta collect yourself, be cool, be steady as a rock.
- Steady as a rock?
- That's right, being a rock is a very heavy life.
Us rock folk are impervious to heat.
We stay cool, we're insusceptible to water, and that's cool, too.
- But, when it rains, isn't it true that even stones...
- Now there you go again.
You're tensing up.
Rain, yeah, sure, maybe rain turn a tree into a water log.
Sometimes rain make a river lose its flood control, but a rock in the rain is just cool, very cool.
- Boy, I never realized that rocks and stones were so...
- All you gotta do is open your mind along with your eyes.
Now, you gotta long road, son, so you remember what I say, okay?
- I will
Mr. Rock Man, I will.
- Play it easy, and remember as you make it through this forest, ain't necessary to posses a point, to have yourself a point.
- I'll remember that.
- Yeah, well I think I'm gonna take myself a short nod, you roll by this way again, just fall in, I'm only a stone's throw...
- It was awfully nice of
Rock Man to explain that to us, and I'll tell you something else,
I'll bet it's not everybody who gets to talk to rock folks.
You know, he really was a...
- My good lad, been rolling right along I see.
- Arrow, it's the pointed man again.
Hello, sir.
- What's this, still talking of points, my boy?
Seems he's obsessed.
I'll make a point of noting that.
- Your point, my son, love game!
- We've just met a man who's made of stone.
- Yes, excellent fellow, splendid chap, all you got a do is relax.
You gotta open your mind, that's cool,.
- He's a nice man.
He knows a lot, and he's generous and...
- He gave you gifts, a little remembrance, perhaps a small memento?
- No, he told me things.
He's interesting to talk to.
- Completely pointless, my boy.
In word, abstract.
To put it bluntly, sonny bob, pointless all pointless.
As they say, no point, a big zero, as they say.
- Hey wait for us, wait.
- Sometimes, you never know how really happy you are to see a person, until after he's gone.
That's pretty much the way Oblio felt when he realized the man who was always pointing had just up and disappeared.
- Jimminy, Arrow, that was a close call.
You gotta watch your step.
That hole could be
Holy cow, there's no bottom to this thing.
Arrow, you could have been...
Arrow.
Gosh, Arrow.

- The lad persists, a dogged trooper that boy, to say nothing of that boy's dog.
They pursue in pointless pursuit.
They're pursuit is pointless.
- Good boy, Arrow, you found him.
Hi, sir, we've been looking all over for ya.
What a pleasure, what a splendid surprise, thought you might be holed up somewhere.
- We were trying to catch up with you, and then we found this gigantic hole.
It was big and dark, and scary.
- And frankly, quite pointless.
- No, we learned a lot.
I know Arrow did, and so did I.
Old Arrow found out he's really gotta...
- Careful sonny, don't get in over your head.
It wouldn't do to bury yourself intellectually,
Point of fact, it never pays to submerge too deeply.
- What is it, Arrow?
- He must hear something.
- Well, of course he hears something, obvious.
- Come on boy, what's wrong?
What is it, Arrow?
It seems like he's trying...
Gone again.
Hey, hey Arrow, hey wait a minute, boy.
Arrow.
Arrow, come back
Arrow, wait for me.
Arrow.
Hey, hey Arrow.
Hey, wait a minute, boy.
Arrow.
Arrow, why did you have to go and...

Don't scare the ladies.
Sorry if he frightened you.
He didn't mean anything by it, really.
We were just watching you dance.
It looked great.
Excuse me, but who are you ladies?

- Thankless, wouldn't you say?
- You.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
- How's that?
Out with it boy, get it off your chest.
- The ladies, those three fat ladies, they way they danced and played and...
- Yes, quite pointless, wouldn't you say, fat, round, pointless, get it?
- No, they do have a point.
It's laughter and merriment and making each other happy.
- Really?
That's an interesting misconception, but then, I'm sure you'll agree.
- Hey, you, are you kidding?
For crying out loud, will you get out of there?
Not there, either.
For the love of Morris, what are you trying to do?
You trying to destroy me?
Will you back off?
What is this?
Will you stop fooling with that mutt and get away from those leaves, you pathetic nincompeep.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I didn't see you, and
I didn't realize...
- All right, all right, all right all ready.
As it happens, those are Sunday in the sunset leaves, a golden veneer and very rare, and you looked like you were just going to plow right...
- Gosh, I'm sorry, I never...
- You know, leaves like that don't just grow on trees or something.
- I really am sorry.
We thought we were just in the regular Pointless Forest.
This is still the
Pointless Forest, isn't it?
- Pointless? Pointless?
Just look at those leaves, each one more pointed than the last.
I tell you, this is the most pointed collection of...
- Then, you're a collector.
Golly, a leaf collector.
- A collector?
What, are you joking or something?
Who ever heard of a grown man going around collecting leaves?
That's weird.
What am I suppose to do, put them in a scrapbook?
- Well, I just thought...
- No, you didn't think.
We're in business here, business.
This isn't some game we're playing young man.
This is the real thing, and we gotta move.
- Jimminy, the leaf business.
I didn't know people sold leaves.
Well, I always thought...
- You thought, you thought, yeah, and while you're thinking I'm losing time, besides, I will do all the thinking around here.
- Gosh, sir, I...
- Listen, I can't talk now, young man.
It's go for broke time from here on in.
This is the time of year we put together a whole fall line.
- I'm afraid I don't know what a fall line is.
- It's the magic of the sorcerer and the excitement of the artist at the moment of creation.
It's when we turn green leaves into greenbacks, when the gold on those trees becomes gold in our pockets.
- You mean you're gathering all these leaves for...
- Gathering? Gathering?
I'm not a gatherer, sonny.
I'm manufacturer, and when you're in the manufacturing game, timing is everything.
You make it or break it on timing.
Sure, design counts, quality counts, maximizing total production potential, that counts.
They all count, but without good ol' timing it's so long Charlie.
- But, with leaves, how do you know if...
- Take the fall season, if
I brought it out in July, it's forget it, it's a distaster.
Timing, it's all timing.
All right, let me ask you something.
- Anything you want.
- You're interested, I like that, and you're sharp
I need people who are sharp.
Sure, I can get help, but good help, that's something else, again.
Question, is the world ready for a tweed leaf?
Stop and think.
- To tell you the truth,
I just don't know.
- I like that, you're honest.
Yes, timing and honesty, that's the name of the game.
All right, let's face it, this is a business just like any other business.
Anyone can learn a business, right?
But, honesty, you either got it or you ain't got it.
Where you from, what's bothering you?
- Excuse me sir, but don't leaves just make themselves?
Naturally, without any...
- My boy, you got a lot to learn.
Tell me, what nationality are you?
- Well, sir, I'm from the Pointed Village.
- That's funny, you don't look pointed.
- As it works out, I'm not, but my parents are.
- It's all right, don't give it a second thought, my boy.
I don't care what a man's faith, creed or color is. The only thing that matters to me is whether or not he can produce.
Well, what do ya say?
- About what?
- Are you in or not?
I'm offering you a chance to get into the leaf game.
- But, what could I do?
- Naturally, you'll have to start on the forest floor and work your way up, and I'll tell you one thing,
I don't want to ever see you or that clown of a dog of yours standing around on the product.
- We wouldn't, you can be sure of that.
- Great opportunity for you, my boy.
It can open doors for you, big doors.
Seasonal, yes we're seasonal, summer, winter, spring, fall.
You and your dog will work like dogs.
Rest?
You'll rest during the fifth season, and their isn't any fifth season, but there are rewards.
It's exciting, challenging work, manufacturing leaves.
- But that's just it, sir.
I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I don't see how
Arrow and I could...
- It's the simplest thing in the world, my boy.
You just plant your roots, right here with me, and by next season, you'll...
- But, we don't have any roots to plant, we aren't...
- No roots? No roots?
Well that just about tears it, doesn't it?
It's too bad, too.
You could've been up there with the best of 'em, kid.
Sunday in the sunset, leaf of gold, you name it, you could have had everything, and together, we would have been unstoppable.
We could have given
'em those tweed leaves, it could have been beautiful, beautiful.
- Boy, it sure sounds like it could've been.
But, something's kind of confusing me.
- Well, you just name it, son.
You can't get answers in this world, if you don't ask questions.
- It's just that I know there's a point to every leaf, but what's the point to all the leaves, your leaves?
- That confuses you, doesn't it?
Well, all of mankind is confused.
You work, you struggle, you fight to survive.
Little by little, you make something, you get ahead, and then one day you look, you see you got something, and I mean really something.
- But, what's the...
- Can't talk now, young man, gotta time problem that won't quit.
Yes, timing.
Timing, that's the name of the game.
- No Arrow, let's go around. Who knows, these could belong to the Leaf Man, too, and you know how he is about stepping on his product.
- That's quite right my boy, watch your step, what ever you do don't bring a leave to grief.
It's branch might blanch, worse yet, it's trunk might go kerplunk.
- Mr. Pointed Man, you should have been with us.
We met a very important business man.
- Was he out raking leaves, perhaps?
This brilliant industrialist, this extraordinary tycoon, ho, ho, ho, he, he, he.
My good lad, your manufacturer is a bust.
His product is so un-unique, it has to be completely pointless.
- No, he's a very industrious industrialist, and he never rests, and he always...
- My boy, he's spinning his wheels.
To put it concisely, his work is futile.
In a manner of speaking, it's pointless.
- That can't be, he told me that...
- Sunday in the sunset, today tweed, tomorrow herringbone.
The man's a lunatic.
He's mad, clearly a case of dementia.
- But he was nice, he offered me a chance to...
- He's a King among me.
He's a prince of a fellow.
I pass, pair of jacks, ace high, in sum, my good lad, pointless, pointless.
- I don't see how you can keep saying that about everybody.
I mean, just because you don't...
- Careful, boy, don't jump to any rash conclusions.
You could land on thin ice, and come up all wet if you follow the image I've drawn.
That could be a chilling experience.
- Little by little, Oblio was learning a good deal about the Pointless Forest and it's unusual residents, but unfortunately for him, and Arrow too, his knowledge couldn't possibly help him anticipate what was hovering directly above.
No, Oblio had absolutely no way of knowing what was in the wind.
Hey.
Hey.
Gee, Arrow, I always thought of a forest as a bunch of tree trunks, but it's a lot more.
It's treetops, and horizons, and hills and meadows and everything.
Man, this is great.
- You know something, this bird could mean real trouble now.
- Aw, Dad, they'll be okay.
- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
- What can an old bird do?
- Well, you're not up there, hanging on for dear life.
- Aw, come on Dad.
You know he's not going to let him drop.
- Well, I don't know that.
I don't know that, and you don't either.
You don't know how dependable he is.
Why, he could very easily...
- Nah, Dad, not a bird that size.
- A bird what size?
- Well, didn't you mention something about a huge bird?
I thought you said...
- You know, when I was a kid, my dad read to me, and I listened, and I listened closely.
I didn't go around interpreting things.
- Yeah, okay Dad.
- I didn't jump to conclusions.
- That's good, Dad.
- I don't know what's happened to kids now days.
You give 'em everything.
You offer to read to 'em.
I don't know, I just don't know.

- Back to earth again, Arrow.
We made it safe and sound.
- As Oblio circled the mammoth egg, he was overcome with a strange sensation.
He looked at the egg, very closely, examining it again and again, but each time, his conclusions were exactly the same.
- Hey, this is weird.
Just when I was sort of starting to think that this Pointless Forest isn't pointless at all, we come across something that really is pointless, at least it sure looks like it is.
- You see, after each one of his adventures in the forest, Oblio always found himself left with a sort of free-floating feeling, that there was some sort of point to what he had experienced.
Even though it had happened in a Pointless Forest.
- A point.
Arrow, I was right in the first place.
Even a thing like this, a thing that looks like it's all round has some sort of point.
Hi, little fella.
I mean, big fella.
Are you all right?
Well, I'm Oblio, and this guy right here's my dog.
His name's Arrow.
What, are you saying what?
Well, what happened is you just got hatched.
You're born now, but don't worry, it happens to everybody, you'll be okay.
Where, is he saying where, Arrow?
That's a little harder.
You see, the name of this place is the Pointless Forest.
That's where we are, all right, but I'll tell you something,
I'm starting to think that instead of being pointless, this forest is full of points.
Take you for instance, sure, you've got a pointed beak, but that's just a point, any one can see that.
Your real point, well, that's something else again.
Why?
That's the hardest one to answer.
That's what I always want to know, why.
And that's the question everyone always asks.
- Splendid idea, my boy.
I'd like mine over easy, with a side-order of bacon, if you please, very crisp and coffee, the old mocca java!
I had a hunch you'd be serving brunch.
And perhaps an apricot danish.
- Mr. Pointed Man,
I'm glad you're here, but how come that nice new bird's mother took him away like that?
We were just talking about the why of everything, why this, why that, and just when
I was thinking that...
- Now, there you go again, you're thinking, that's very destructive, my lad, most destructive indeed.
If a person does enough thinking, a certain amount of knowledge is sure to follow.
The results, sonny bob, could be a life of misery.
- But, I can't help it,
I haven't been trying to think.
Things just sort of start popping up in my mind.
They occur to me out of...
- Thoughts just start popping up into your mind, ideas formed without any effort on your part?
You find that concepts simply conceptualize?
- Well, yes.
- That's grim.
- It started way back when I met the rock man.
- It's a disaster.
- And it just kept on happening.
- Mayday, it's a complete mayday.
- I was hoping maybe you could help me figure out just exactly...
- There's really nothing more that I can do.
You're out of my hands,
I tried to help you boy.
I can show you the pointlessness of it all, but you wouldn't listen.
- Sir, I hope you don't think I'm ungrateful.
- You had to go digging around, didn't ya?
You had to let thoughts slip into your head.
You're lost lad, lost.
The kid blew it, had everything going for him, and he blew it.
The fact is, my boy, that it's under the circumstances, there's no place in the
Pointless Forest for you.
- But, where will
I go, what will I do?
I can't go home again, the Count had me banished.
- Ta ta, jolly bye, ciao bucky, ciao.
- Golly, gone again.
I wonder where he goes when he does that.
- Vanishing Point, ol' man, correct, the Vanishing Point, just another one of the facilities.
Well, adieu, fare thee well, you take care of yourself, ya hear?
- So long, sir.
- Oblio watched as the Pointed Man disappeared, but unlike all the other times, he was not especially overwhelmed by what he saw.
- I think he's really gone this time, Arrow.
Arrow?
Arrow?
Here, boy.
Arrow?
I hear you boy, but where are you?
He's gone.
Stay where you are, Arrow.
Don't move, I'll find ya.
I know I will.
Good boy, Arrow.
Come on boy, you're all right now.
Come on, Arrow.
- It had been a full day for the two travelers, a very full day.
For Oblio, it had been one adventure after another, of course, it had been pretty adventurous for Arrow, too.
- That Vanishing Point, it only made it so I couldn't see.
It didn't make it so you weren't really there.
I'm starting to think that the Pointed Man, nice as he was, was realy about the only pointless person we've met in this whole Pointless Forest.
Sure, he did an awful lot of talking, and it all sounded very fine, almost like the Count in a way, and after all, what's such a big deal about having a point on your head?
Nothing against you,
Arrow, you're great.
But, I sort of think what's in your head is a lot more important.
It sure gets dark fast, doesn't it?

- But, I miss him,
I miss my Oblio.
- Yeah, he was a great little guy.
- And I'm worried about him.
- That little guy, nah, he'll do great out there.
- But he's so young.
- Yeah, but he's sharp, he's sharp.
He's young, but he's sharp.
- We should have never let them send him away.
- Yeah, well, go tell the Count that,
I mean, it was the law, dear.
- It's a bad law.
- Well, good law, bad law, what difference does it make?
It's the law.
- It makes all the difference.
A good law never would have sent my Oblio away, never.
- Dear, the law is the law.
- Well, you should have challenged it.
- What, I should have challenged it?
- We all should have.
- Law, I mean, but, but the Count came right out and said...
- The Count, the Count.
What about my Oblio?
- Well, look, I mean,
I'm just one man, I...
- We should have all stood up.
Even the King seemed like he was against...
- Well, maybe you're right, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should have tried.
- He's so young.
- What, the King?
- My little Oblio.
- Oblio, Oblio, it's Oblio.
Hey, it's Oblio
- Welcome home Oblio.
- We're glad you're back, Oblio.
- You tell 'em Ob, break it down for 'em.
- Come by the shop, Oblio.
I have some butter balls for you, round, competely round.
- Hello, Oblio.
- There he is, there's Oblio.
- My baby, my Oblio.
- Well, hi son.
Hi, Oblio.
- On to the palace.
- To the King.
- Your majesty, your majesty, there's a mob at the palace gate.
- Mob?
Well, that's pretty hard to believe.
- Well, it's true, you know what a mob is.
Shall I call out the palace guard?
- Well, that does seem a bit excessive, doesn't it?
- Well, what do you suggest?
Send out a pastry tray, and let them eat cake?
- Well, that's never worked before.
Tell me, what does your intelligence agency make of it?
- Nothing yet, nothing.
They're still trying to infiltrate the crowd, but I'll tell you one thing, according to my son, it's all for that kid, that twerpy, round-headed Oblio.
- Oblio?
You mean little Oblio, who we...
- Yes, my son claims he's come back.
- Really?
Oblio, little Oblio is back?
- This is gravely serious, my dear King.
- Yes, it is.
You know something, Count?
You may have misread the will of the people in that Oblio case.
An unruly mob?
Well, isn't that just the limit?
- Silence, I demand silence.
Can't a man get a little peace and quiet in his own...
Say, what are you doing back?
This litle runt is an outlaw.
You're an outlaw, child.
You are banished to the Pointless Forest.
- And I went to the
Pointless Forest, in fact I...
- Nonsense, sheer, irrevocable, nonsense.
I'll have you in chains for this.
Arrest this little...
- Hold it, hold it, Count, the boy was saying something.
- Yeah, right on, break it down for him, Obi.
- Yes, right on Obi.
- Well, sir, we did go to the Pointless Forest,
Arrow and I, all through it, in fact.
And you know something?
It isn't pointless at all.
- It's not?
- What?
What?
Not pointless?
Madness.
That's madness.
Sheer madness.
- Will you be quiet, Count?
I want to hear Oblio.
Now, Oblio, you were saying?
- Well, the fact is, sir, just about everything we ran into had a point to it, the leaves, the trees, everything.
- I see, Obi, well, I can't really argue that one with you, but what about yourself, son?
- Well, sir, I figure if everything has a point, then I must have one, too.
- He has a point there.
Villain, treason, public naughtiness.
I will not stand by while this pointless person tries to undo the law of the land.
My dear and loyal friends, if he had a point, he'd have one.
Impossible.
- And so it was, that Oblio and Arrow returned safely from their travels, only a little older, but certainly a good deal wiser.
As for the Pointed Village, well, the way things worked out, it was a much better place to live after Oblio's return.
True, the people didn't have their once cherished points, right there on top of their heads, put that didn't matter so much anymore.
People just started assuming that every man had some kind of a point, whether it shows or not.
- The end.
Now that's a story son, is that a story, or...
- Yeah, Dad, it was a good story, really.
- Good, good, it was great, great story.
- Sure, Dad, it was.
- I mean it had everything right there, adventure, a little comedy, funny scene or two.
There was a lesson.
You caught the lesson, didn't you?
- Right, Dad, I caught it.
- Well, what do you think it was?
- Well, just because somebody doesn't have what other people have doesn't mean that you know, they have to be turned out of the kingdom, or something.
- Yes.
- Dad?
- What is it, son?
- Thanks for reading me the story.
- You're welcome, son.

The oldest and driest desert in the world.
Fifty thousand square miles of eternally shifting sand.
You'd think nobody could make a living here.
And yet, when the wind dies down and the dust settles...
...you see a tiny track, and many more.
No matter how harsh and inhospitable a place is...
...there's always someone who's willing to live there.
A whole community of little creatures have had millions of years...
...to adapt to the impossible conditions in this desert.
This one must have had three legs.
This one only one.
The beetles who live here have an air-cooled cooling system...
...like a Volkswagen, so they have to run like crazy to keep their cool.
Even courting has to be done on the run.
A quick kiss at full gallop, and the romance is over.
When you can't run any longer...
...you have to dig like mad to get out of the heat.
He goes in upside down.
He doesn't dig, he just walks right in.
And this one pulls the blanket over his head.
And the gecko dives in as if the sand is water.
This beautiful person has a different cooling system, more like a limousine.
She doesn't have to dash around like those Volkswagen types.
She can take life more slowly.
She even has a windshield wiper.
She cleans her eyes with her tongue.
And digging is done at leisure.
First the right hand, then the right foot at half speed.
Then the left hand, left foot...
...right hand, right foot.
The sidewinder's favorite meal is the diving gecko.
But geckos play hard-to-get.
So the sidewinder resorts to a very sneaky trick to catch his prey.
First, he buries himself in the sand until he is quite invisible.
Then his tail comes up and pretends to be a blade of grass.
Now, geckos don't eat grass, but ants do.
And geckos eat ants.
At this point, things happen rather quickly.
Ant goes for tail, gecko goes for ant...
End of gecko.
So some die and some live in the heart of the unearthly Red Namib Desert...
...in southwest Africa on the tropic of Capricorn.
And on the fringes of the Red Namib...
...lives the real miracle of the desert, the oryx.
The most beautiful of all antelope.
These amazing animals always manage to look sleek and well-fed...
...in this arid region where there seems to be no food and no water.
The austere beauty of the Namib remains undisturbed...
...because man finds the region so intimidating, he hardly ever intrudes.
But to the oryx and the little creatures of the Namib...
...this waterless, hostile desert is paradise.
Where the red desert ends, there's a vast white desert...
...where it's so quiet, you can hear the silence.
The White Namib, a region of rugged moonscapes and endless vistas.
Here the eye can feast on breathtaking beauty...
...but for the mouth, there seems to be nothing.
Still, oryx roam its boundless plains...
...and on the barren slopes of a desert mountain...
...you'll find a whole tribe of baboons...
...who are quite content to live in these grim surroundings.
Of course, those rocks do get rather hard after a while.
Home comforts are few, but they don't seem to mind...
...the lack of modern conveniences.
Their social system works very much like human society.
At the very top, there's the big chief whose word is law.
And at the very bottom, there's the little guy...
...who likes to mind his own business.
Now you know who's important around here.
Actually, they're a happy gang.
And when it cools down towards evening, they get playful.
And then the acrobatic types start showing off.
Some don't do it very well, but they're willing to work at it.
Trees are very scarce in the White Namib...
...so the little weaverbirds have learned to share and cooperate.
They build large condominiums where dozens of families can live...
...each in its own apartment.
And they go in for quite a variety of architectural styles:
Squat ranch type, complex...
...modern, artistic...
...high-rise, and even symbolic.
Some nests are more than 100 years old, and the little tenants...
...are continually building on, remodeling and repairing.
A cozy little community where you can raise a contented family.
But sometimes tragedy strikes.
Once in a long while, a dewdrop will hang in just the right spot...
...at the right time, to focus the sun's rays on the dry, combustible thatch.
In a few minutes, the flames destroy a hundred years' work...
...and bring grief to many families.
The vast White Namib is only a narrow band...
...on the map of the immense
African continent...
...but it's gradually encroaching deeper and deeper inland...
...creating a region of scrubby growth and very little grass:
The Pre-Namib, where the dainty springbok roam.
This used to be lush grassland, but for the past 10,000 years...
...the Pre-Namib has been slowly drying out, and the animals and plants that live here...
...have to adapt to a climate where the rainfall...
...gets less and less as the years pass.
Some plants have adapted magnificently to the challenge of the changing climate.
Stapelia flowers, for instance...
...had to evolve a way of getting pollinated...
...in a region where there are no bees.
So instead of emitting a pretty smell to entice bees...
...they put out a powerful stench like a rotting carcass...
...and this attracts the blue fly, who likes smelly meat.
As he scurries about looking for that lovely, stinking food he can smell...
...he does a good job of pollinating the flower.
When he finally realizes he's been tricked, he flies off in disgust.
But he has done something useful for once.
In a few short weeks after the rain...
...this plant grows quickly to maturity, bears seeds, and dies.
But even after death, it protects its seeds...
...in those strange-looking pods for a year or more...
...until the rain comes again.
Then the moisture causes those dead parts...
...to move like bizarre living creatures, and they open up.
And then the moisture triggers little springs inside the pods.
The seeds are shot out in a hurry...
...to germinate and grow while the soil is still wet...
...so they can bear more seeds to start the next generation.
An incredible variety of animals...
...have accepted the challenge of living in the Pre-Namib...
...where you are never sure whether it'll rain this year or next year.
The scaly anteater, who looks like a tired medieval knight in armor.
The wart hog, who's so ugly, he's beautiful...
...and who always goes into his home tail-first.
Porcupines, who should know better than anyone...
...not to go through the same door at the same time.
The scorpion, who carries her babies on her back.
The chameleon, whose eyes move independently...
...so he can see where he's going and where he's been.
He must be the only creature in the world...
...whose left eye doesn't know what his right eye is doing.
The dikkop, who spends 95%% of his life looking like a stuffed bird...
...because he stands so very still and never blinks.
When he does move, it's only for a split second...
...and then he freezes again.
And then there are wildebeests...
...and ostrich and starlings...
...and zebra and giraffe.
There's a whole treasure house of animal life...
...in the wide and thirsty Pre-Namib.
It's also lion country, and at the water holes...
...the animals are nervous and skittish.
Even the appearance of a cub causes sudden panic.
Which, of course, makes Junior feel mighty superior.
Some days, the animals will drink quite calmly...
...in the presence of a whole pride.
They seem to sense that the lions have eaten well...
...and will not be hunting today.
In fact, the king's belly is so full, it gets up long after he does.
So who's afraid of a slob like that?
But if one of the younger generation gets cheeky...
...that slob suddenly walks like a king again.
His Majesty knows how to cope with the generation gap...
...and he will make an example of the young upstart...
...who has dared to challenge the establishment.
A long, long stare until the young one is thoroughly cowed.
And now the young rebel has to lie down again...
...so that the king can come walking past once more.
And this time he knows he'll be shown the respect due to him.
He's not even a very imposing specimen, as lions go...
...but he does remember that he's descended from a long line of kings.
The hyena could have been king of the desert.
His jaws are stronger than those of a lion, and he has those powerful forequarters...
...but nature saw fit to give him a weak and wobbly rear end...
...and a slow, ungainly gait.
So instead of being king of the desert, he's a lowly trash collector...
...who lives off the leftovers of the lion and other hunters.
It's just as well he's not the king, because he's a real stinker.
He's a coward. He's sneaky.
He often slobbers and drools.
He loves to roll in the rotting remains...
...of some dead animal to mask his own smell.
He has a silly giggle.
And, worst of all, he's not content to live on garbage alone...
...so he'll eat the babies of other animals when he can get to them.
The faster ones get away because he's too lazy to exert himself...
...but the smaller and slower ones are in constant danger.
Yellow-billed ducklings are fortunate...
...because their mother is a very clever actress.
She also has great courage.
When she sees a hyena prowling about, she tells the kids to be quiet...
...and walks towards the hyena...
...while they start sneaking away towards the water.
Now she gives a quack to get the hyena's attention...
...and goes into her wounded-bird act.
She really hams it up...
...because she's got to keep him from spotting the chicks.
So she flounders about pitifully to convince him he can catch her easily.
But when he gets too close, she recovers miraculously...
...and streaks for the water.
For a moment, he begins to doubt the sincerity of her performance...
...but she quickly goes into her next act, the pathetic drowning duck...
...with all the cries for help and all the "glub-glubs" the scene calls for.
So he believes her again and follows her at his leisure...
...because he's sure she's easy meat.
And behind his back, the chicks slip quietly into the water.
This is a crucial moment, because they have to swim across open water...
...to get to a safe hiding place...
...so she dare not let his attention wander away from her.
And she has to let him come dangerously close...
...to keep him convinced he can catch her.
When at last the chicks reach the hiding place...
...she can consider her own safety and make another miraculous recovery.
And he begins to wonder whether he's been taken for a sucker.
Somehow the scavengers and the carrion-eaters...
...are the unbeautiful people of the desert...
...not only in looks, but also in character.
The stuffy-looking marabous...
...are members of the elegant and aristocratic stork family...
...but thousands of years ago, they started making their living by disposing...
...of the remains of dead animals...
...and they began to look more and more like unsuccessful undertakers.
Nowadays, the marabou wears a threadbare black coat...
...and a holier-than-thou expression on his unlovely face.
They seem to look down their noses at everyone else...
...and always seem to be discussing...
...the follies and the sinfulness of the other animals.
The female ostrich is a dull gray, but the male is a handsome devil.
At mating time, the handsome boys flash their plumage to impress the girls.
And the less good-looking ones have to fight for their lady loves.
Finally, a loving couple will find a secluded spot...
...to do their beautiful mating dance.
Pretty soon, they start a family.
Actually, he's a better parent than she is.
And on a hot afternoon, she will join the rest of the gang at the water hole...
...leaving him to keep an eye on the nest.
This is a full-time job, because each egg is a whole meal...
...and there are many freeloaders in the Namib.
Meanwhile, back at the nest...
...young Oscar chooses this moment to get born.
There's no one to welcome him because Mother is out swimming...
...and Father is out fighting Hottentots.
Oscar feels very lonely, so he wobbles off to find company.
He is now only two minutes old, but already he knows about camouflage.
On the morning of his wedding day...
...the wart hog goes down to the water hole for a bath...
...because he wants to look nice for his bride-to-be.
That's enough.
Meanwhile, the young lady of his choice moves into his bachelor apartment...
...and immediately starts changing things.
He does a thorough job of grooming himself today...
...and she wants her future home to be just right.
And when he comes home, he begins to realize...
...that you have to make some adjustments to your lifestyle when you get married.
And there you have as handsome a couple of young newlyweds as you can hope to find.
The friendliest and the most affectionate little creatures...
...in the desert are the meerkats.
Sorry, fella.
They're also most inquisitive, and when a stranger intrudes...
...he's received with courtesy and friendly curiosity.
Even a poisonous cobra is inspected and invited to be friendly.
An egg is pure frustration.
He knows there's something good in there, but how do you get to it?
The mongoose looks like the meerkat, but he's from a different family.
When he finds an egg, he hikes it to the nearest rock...
...juggles it into position, takes a quick sighting, and shoots.
But the meerkat doesn't have the know-how.
He always digs for his food...
...so instinctively, he tries to solve this problem by digging.
But it doesn't work.
Maybe he can learn by watching the mongoose.
All right, he'll try that.
That guy makes it look so easy.
But the egg-eater snake...
...can swallow an egg
10 times as big as his head...
...without breaking it or his head.
He unhooks his lower jaw from the rest of his face...
...so he can open his mouth wide enough.
At first, the egg keeps slipping away, and he goes around in circles.
But he has a good reason for that.
Eventually, he has the egg surrounded so it can't slip away anymore.
And now he can do his trick.
Once the egg is safely inside him, he crushes it...
...and squeezes out all the good stuff without spilling a drop.
And a few minutes later, he ejects the shell in a neat, disposable package.
But if you want to swallow eggs whole, there's no room for teeth in your mouth.
That makes him the most defenseless snake in the world...
...so apparently, Mother Nature has played a nasty trick on him.
But to make up for it, she painted phony teeth on his lips...
...and she taught him to put up such an act of ferocity...
...that he can even intimidate an elephant.
That intricate winding movement makes him look twice his size...
...and lets his scales make an angry rasping sound as they rub together.
He pretends to strike viciously, but he has to make sure he misses...
...otherwise his enemy will find out that he has no teeth.
But his act is so good that no one ever calls his bluff...
...and everyone believes he's very dangerous.
A baboon will eat every creepy-crawly thing he can find under rocks...
...but if he should come across an egg-eater snake...
...he'll fall down in a dead faint.
And would you believe it, he looks under the same rock and faints again.
Sometimes he's sorry he got married, because she's always cleaning house.
He wants a girlfriend, and that's his way of advertising.
He knows if there's a lady tapping beetle within half a mile...
...she'll hear him and answer back.
So all day and all night, he taps and listens, taps and listens...
...because tapping beetles are scarce here...
...and he has a long and lonely quest ahead of him.
The backfiring beetle doesn't use his rear end for tapping. He uses it to defend himself.
His ammunition is a stinging acid, and he always hits his enemy right in the eye.
These are some of the animals who are at home in the Pre-Namib.
They've accepted the hardships of the changing planet and seem to enjoy...
...living in this arid land where the rain sometimes stays away for years.
In the southern part of the Pre-Namib, billions of seeds...
...lie waiting for years in the dust of the desert floor.
When the rain comes at last, a miraculous transformation happens.
The desert covers itself in a wall-to-wall carpet, and an incredible variety...
...of flowers celebrate the coming of the life-giving moisture.
For a few weeks, the Pre-Namib tries to recapture the glories of the past...
...when this was a paradise.
But the glory is short-lived.
The sun dehydrates the earth again, and the flowers return to dust.
But they leave billions of seeds in the desert soil...
...because the rain may come again, and they'll have another festival.
For now, the desert reverts to bleakness...
...and those few weeks of color seem as if they never happened.
There is one spot in the Pre-Namib that is a year-round paradise...
...because the Cubango River streams out of the Tropics.
Unlike other rivers, it never reaches the sea.
It blunders into the vastness of the desert and is swallowed.
But before those millions of gallons of water disappear under the sand...
...they create a luxuriant subtropical jungle in the middle of the desert.
A year-round Garden of Eden, complete with serpent and other predators.
The kingfisher pinpoints his target precisely...
...and gets into the exact position by moving this way and that.
Then he strikes.
Like a fighter pilot, he dives with the sun behind him so his prey can't see him coming.
At high noon, he goes straight down.
And later, when the sun is lower, he comes in at an angle.
Far below the lily pads, there's another paradise where life is mostly placid...
...with some hectic moments.
The bream has as many as a thousand babies at one time...
...and she has a very cute trick to protect them from predators.
Father keeps a lookout so he can warn Mother when danger comes.
Old snaggletooth comes prowling out of his lair, and Father nearly throws a fit.
He gives the alarm, so the kids beeline for Mother, who promptly swallows them...
...the whole thousand.
Whoops, little Wilbur is late.
Snaggletooth attacks once more.
"Hey, Mom, let me in, let me in!"
"Shucks!"
The villain gives up and leaves, so Dad gives the all clear, and Mother spits them out.
Most of the kids are happy to be free...
...but there are always some insecure sissies who want to go back inside where it's safe...
...and she cannot get rid of them.
"Go and play outside."
In the jungles and on the flood plains...
...on the banks of the Cubango...
...nobody needs to work, because there's plenty of water and food for everybody.
There's no day-to-day struggle for existence, and the animals enjoy a life...
...of peace and plenty.
One may wonder why animals in the surrounding desert don't flock...
...to share in this life of luxury.
Here, the trees and plants bear fruits and seeds and berries to suit every taste.
The seeds of the tambuti tree jump and cavort...
...because inside each one there's a little worm with the hiccups.
In paradise, even the worms are cute.
And in every tree, there's a whole parade of characters from every walk of life.
A lady with her hair in curlers.
A cross between a zebra and a vacuum cleaner.
A little dachshund, complete with waggly tail.
A dizzy blond with a painted face.
And other beautiful people.
A portly old gentleman in conservative gray.
The hobo.
The poor guy on skid row.
Longhaired hippie.
And the real far-out weirdo who does his own wild thing.
And, of course, the bloated, overfed, overdressed slob.
He illustrates what's wrong with living in paradise...
...because many members of this society have become blasé and bored with life.
Things are just too easy in the Cubango Basin.
They no longer have a zest for living like their cousins out in the inhospitable desert.
Here, life offers no challenge, and many of them have become slobs and easy riders.
The only excitement in their lives comes in high summer...
...when the marula trees are in full fruit.
At first, the marulas are very tasty and hard to get at.
You have to be either agile or strong to get your share.
After a few weeks, the marulas get overripe, and they start dropping from the trees.
Then all the animals wade in and gorge themselves on the rotting fruit.
It starts fermenting in their tummies and turns into a very potent brew.
On the way home, things start happening to them.
When night falls, there's peace again.
A very blissful peace.
Not everybody in the Cubango leads a wasteful life.
Some members of this too-prosperous society are still sober, hardworking folk.
The weavers here don't build condos like those in the White Namib.
Each one builds his own free-swinging nest.
To do that, he has to perform a small miracle.
He has no hands, only his little beak to make all those intricate knots.
So a newlywed is nervous when he builds his first nest under the watch of his bride.
When the job is done, he hops onto a twig and timidly invites his wife to inspect it.
She flits across and takes a long, hard look at her future home.
It doesn't look very neat, and she doesn't even like the neighborhood.
She's got to raise her kids in this?
"You like it, huh? You like it? Huh?"
She makes a closer inspection and subjects the house to testing...
...to see whether it conforms to her specifications, and he's in quite a flutter.
She's not satisfied and vents her fury on his substandard workmanship.
"You didn't like it, huh?"
"You bet your life I didn't like it."
He will try again, and this time he chooses the neighborhood carefully.
He's all of a twitter because she's watching.
First he has to tie two twigs together, but it's not easy. Those twigs are springy.
Oh, boy, it's not easy.
But if all those others can do it, he can too.
One day, he'll build a house he can be proud of...
...although he'll still get nervous when his wife comes to approve it.
The hornbill installs his wife inside a tree trunk and seals her up for three months.
But first he cleans out her cell to make sure she'll be comfortable in there.
Then he flies off to get some clay to wall her in, and she starts undressing.
She plucks out her coarser feathers so she can be soft for the chicks when they hatch.
Without those feathers, she can't fly, but she won't be using her wings for a while.
He comes back with a beakful of clay and blocks the entrance...
...so she and her chicks will be safe.
He leaves only a slit, the size and shape for a hornbill's bill...
...so he can bring her food and water while she lays and hatches her eggs.
And then there are suddenly five mouths to feed, and Father has to provide for them all.
Throughout the summer, he's the hardest-working member...
...of the opulent Cubango community.
When the chicks grow bigger he has to provide a balanced diet.
One day, green stuff with lots of vitamins.
The next day, proteins.
One lucky day, a swarm of proteins comes buzzing around the nest...
...saving Dad a lot of labor.
He's quite sorry when they leave.
Oh, well, back to the grind.
The chicks have been taught not to pollute their own nest, and their aim is remarkable.
As they grow, it gets crowded in the nursery.
So one fine day, Mother breaks open the roof, and out they come.
Father feels happy and proud to see his children at last...
...but perhaps he also feels sad and discarded.
Now they don't need him anymore.
Although wart hogs get as smashed...
...as everybody else during the marula binge...
...they lead exemplary lives for the rest of the year.
Family ties are strong, and the little ones are attached to their mother.
Of course, in every family there is always one unlucky one.
If there are any knocks coming, he gets them.
The cheetah is the fastest runner in the world...
...and if Mrs. Wart Hog is not alert, she can lose some of her family.
But she's quick to sense danger, and hogs are pretty fast on their feet too.
Each one finds a hole and pops in tail-first.
The unlucky one chooses a hole that's too small, and now he can get neither in nor out.
Luckless is trapped very far from home.
They say hogs can't count, but Mother knows that one of her children is missing.
At last, the frustrated cheetah goes away.
Mother searches every hole and behind every bush for her child.
She cannot rest before she finds him.
Luckless guesses it's safe to come out...
...and it dawns on him that he doesn't know the way home.
All night long, Mother keeps a vigil for her little lost one.
He's never slept alone, and in the middle of the night...
...some big animals come sniffing around.
He tries to lie very still and pretend he's only a stone...
...but he's very frightened.
When a baby wart hog gets separated from its mother, it'll try to find a substitute.
It's not easy to get yourself adopted...
...when you have a face that only your mother can love.
The only one who will adopt him is an old rotting log.
He's a very sad little boy.
When a honey badger is young, his parents abandon him...
...and he has to find his own food.
He's not an expert hunter yet.
He'll have to live on worms and grubs in this land of milk and honey...
...unless some fairy godmother comes to his aid.
Incredibly, nature provides just such a godmother in the shape of a little bird.
For a while, she looks on as he scratches and digs...
...for the few scraps of food he can find.
When the time is ripe, she introduces herself.
At first, he resents this noisy, fluttering nuisance, but eventually...
...some deep instinct makes him realize dimly that he has to follow her.
So she finally leads him to the objective:
A big, fat beehive.
All his instincts come to the surface.
He knows his favorite food is in there, and nothing will stop him.
His hide is impervious to bee stings. The only vulnerable spot is the tip of his nose.
At last, the payoff.
This amazing partnership of the honey guide bird and the badger...
...is an intriguing example of teamwork between different species.
He doesn't eat all the loot, because she's entitled to her share.
The inhabitants of the Cubango Basin...
...don't realize how lucky they are to be living in luxury.
To them, this land of plenty is the whole universe.
They're unaware that their bounteous habitat...
...is a small green world floating...
...in the vast emptiness of the Pre-Namib.
The Pre-Namib, again, is dwarfed by its neighbor on Capricorn, the Kalahari.
This is the most treacherous desert of all, because after the short rainy season...
...it looks like an immense paradise that can rival the opulence of the Cubango.
The grass is as high as an elephant's eye, and while the surface water lasts...
...everybody prospers.
At the water holes, there is so much traffic that all the grass is worn away.
Zebra in their thousands.
Graceful kudu, the males with beautiful horns...
...the females with beautiful ears.
Oryx, who, unlike their cousins in the Namib, revel in the abundant water.
Ostrich.
The fussy-looking secretary bird, who's very good at short takeoffs...
...but needs a heck of a long runway for landing.
The towering giraffe, who makes the zebra look like toys.
Some years there's even a vast shallow lake for a short while after the rain...
...where water birds converge in great numbers.
The lake covers 8000 square miles, but it's only a few inches to a few feet in depth.
And most years, a great flock of pelicans establish...
...their breeding colony in the middle of the lake.
They look stodgy and comical on the ground and pompous in the air.
But on water, they have style and elegance.
They gather in flotillas to herd fish into the shallows...
...where they dip in a graceful ballet to collect food for their chicks.
But the lake and the many water holes are impermanent.
Soon the water will sink away into the Kalahari sand...
...and there'll be a long, grim wait of nine months or more...
...before the rain comes again.
The only human beings...
...in the deep Kalahari are a few Bushmen.
They don't live in tribes, but roam about in small family groups.
The region is so vast that one family hardly ever meets another.
They must be the most carefree and contented people in the world...
...because they own nothing.
In the desert, there's nothing you can own, but everything you need.
They're also the most gentle people, possibly because they've never seen...
...anything as hard as a rock or a stone in their lives.
Where they live, there's only sand and trees and grass and animals.
So their tools are made of leather or bone or wood.
They never experience anything harder than wood.
When they find food, they eat it all at one sitting...
...so they have very expandable stomachs.
When they sleep, their heads never touch the ground...
...because there are crawly things in the sand that can get into their ears.
They dig their elbows into the soft sand and use their shoulders as pillows.
The children have to have an intimate understanding of the animals around them.
So the elders teach them, in stereophonic sound yet.
But somehow the children manage to listen to two teachers at once.
They are superb mimics, and they feel a close affinity...
...with the animals who are their neighbors and also their food.
The Bushman is a very small man, and his weapons are puny.
He has to sneak up very close to his food...
...because his arrow can only kill at 30 paces.
The biggest nuisance in his life is the go-away bird...
...who seems to take pleasure in sabotaging him.
It'll watch him stalking painstakingly up to his quarry...
...and then tell it to go away.
Such beautiful targets.
When the water holes begin to grow smaller, the animals get restless.
Soon they'll have to move away, leaving all that beautiful grass uneaten.
They're loath to leave this bountiful food supply...
...and they'll hang on until the last of the water disappears.
Fights break out easily, and when two oryx bulls lose their tempers...
...the outcome can be fatal, so the leader of the herd will try to make peace.
Those horns are like rapiers, and the oryx use them like expert swordsmen.
The peacemaker's efforts are not very successful.
He only succeeds in goading them further.
With a sudden jab, one gets his horn into position for the fatal thrust.
If he can drive that horn in a few more inches, he'll go right to the heart.
When things get too hot, the loser breaks and runs.
He'll live to fight another day.
The smaller water holes dry up first...
...but sometimes there's plenty of water below the sand.
You just have to know where to dig.
But elephants are finicky, and this water stinks.
The royal family has its own water supply, and when it runs low...
...a young female always gets the job of keeping all the other animals away.
She has to work out there on the hot plain while the rest of the family...
...take it easy in the shade.
She grew fat and lazy during the affluent season...
...and finds it a very tedious assignment.
One pesky impala in particular makes her life a misery.
The strange thing is that the impala doesn't really need the water.
He can get enough moisture by licking the dew off the grass...
...in the early morning.
Maybe he gets up too late, or maybe he just likes to pester her for the hell of it.
Of course, lion is king only until elephants make the scene...
...even if they're only youngsters.
The Bushman is not dependent on water holes.
His forebears have had thousands of years to adapt to the Kalahari...
...so he needs very little liquid, and he knows where to find it.
An insignificant-looking dry twig tells him where to dig.
Anyone else would die of thirst in a few days...
...in this treacherous desert that doesn't look like a desert...
...but he can survive for months on end.
He unearths a bulbous root...
...which is really just a solid lump of wood with hard fibers that are merely damp.
Civilized man would need some pretty complicated technology...
...and machinery to get water out of it, but he uses the very simplest of tools.
His scraper is a stick that has been split to give it a sharp edge...
...and he produces some dry-looking shavings.
But you take a handful, point your thumb at your mouth...
...squeeze very hard and wait for it.
The baboons always have a secret supply of water...
...and they're not going to tell anybody where it is.
And when a Machalahari ventures into the deep Kalahari...
...on a hunting trip, he has to find water...
...because, unlike the Bushman, he doesn't know how to make liquid from a root.
But he has his own way of finding out where the water is.
First, he drills a hole in a giant ant heap when he's sure a baboon is watching him...
...because he knows baboons are incurably inquisitive.
Next, he puts some wild melon seeds into the hole...
...and works them in so that they drop into a hollow.
Then he saunters off, knowing the baboon is burning with curiosity.
The baboon doesn't trust that human being at all, so he plays it cool.
But he's dying to know what gives in that confounded hole.
Finally, Mr. Inquisitive can't take it any longer.
He's got to know what's in there.
He reaches in, grabs a fistful, and now his hand's too big to come out.
If he had the sense to drop the seeds, he could free his hand.
Now he lets go when it's too late.
So that was a smart enough way to catch a baboon...
...but he still has to make him talk.
Now, he knows that salt is very scarce in this particular area...
...and that baboon is going to eat those lumps like candy.
In fact, he has such a ball eating salt that he completely forgets he's under arrest...
...and that in a little while he's going to be a mighty thirsty baboon.
Next morning, the Machalahari goes to have a closer look...
...to see whether his prisoner is ready to talk.
He decides the brainwashing has worked, so he sets him free...
...knowing that in his condition he won't care who follows him...
...to the secret reservoir.
The Machalahari has no eyes for the beauty of the setting.
To him, water is beautiful.
Now the water holes have dried up to only a trickle...
...and soon that will be hard-baked soil.
In a few short weeks, paradise turns into purgatory.
The merciless sun scorches down, and dust devils dance...
...across the parching earth.
Most of the animals migrate to other regions...
...but some hardy and some foolhardy ones remain.
And the vultures know that their prosperous time is approaching.
By this time, the great lake has dried up completely...
...into a boundless, white expanse.
Mummified fish lie scattered on the dry, cracked surface.
Animals migrating across the lake from the Kalahari...
...plod through cruel mirages of water that doesn't splash under their feet...
...and they pass phantom trees that offer no shade.
After days of plodding, some begin to panic...
...when there seems to be no end to the vastness.
Some just give up and stop walking.
Some years, the drought comes too soon for the pelicans...
...who nested in the center of the lake.
The parents stand around helplessly as their little black chicks...
...suffer agonies of hunger and thirst and heat.
They're almost fully grown, but are still too young to fly...
...so they're trapped in this boundless desolation.
One little one begins to walk blindly away into the searing heat...
...and his parents can only look on in despair.
In the first weeks of his life, this was a bountiful lake.
He cannot understand how his beautiful world could change into this pitiless void.
So he walks and walks, hoping in despair to find his beautiful world again...
...somewhere in this vast emptiness.
In the evening, cool, moist air...
...comes drifting into the desert, bringing a promise of life-giving rain.
In the morning, the clouds are still streaming into the desert sky...
...but the sun burns mercilessly, and one by one...
...they shrivel in the searing heat.
A few stragglers survive, but as they penetrate deeper into the desert...
...they, too, dwindle and fade.
In the end, the parents have to abandon their chicks...
...and fly away to the sea.
And the chicks begin to walk.
They are very weak now, and the dried-out lake is endless.
It is a death march that leaves a trail of little bodies...
...for mile upon mile on the vastness...
...until only a pitiful few are left alive.
Far away from the desert, the clouds build up into towering masses...
...as they prepare to invade the stronghold of the sun once more.
Like a liberating army, wave after wave of cumulus...
...surges across the African plains.
Even before they reach the desert, the sun begins to pound down on the upper layers...
...and it tears great gaps in the ranks of the invaders.
But when the advance guard reaches the desert, it is still a formidable force.
It penetrates several miles into the desert...
...and some clouds even discharge their load of rain.
But the rain never reaches the ground because the relentless sun evaporates...
...the water before it can fall on the thirsting earth.
The invasion loses impetus under the fury of the sun...
...and the clouds are vanquished.
And the surviving chicks wait in vain for relief from their anguish.
By nightfall, only a few scattered remnants drift around aimlessly.
During the night, the clouds regroup their forces.
Great masses move around in the darkness like vast engines of war...
...as they maneuver into position for another invasion.
At dawn, they launch another massive attack.
Again, wave after wave sweeps towards the desert.
And in the turmoil of a titanic battle of the elements, the sun is finally obliterated.
Then there is a great hush.
Strangely, when deliverance comes at last, the animals show no signs of rejoicing.
They merely wait impassively for the rain to pass.
And after a few minutes, it stops.
Abruptly and suddenly.
The thirsty earth soaks up the long-awaited moisture.
But in the rocky parts, the water runs off and brings new perils.
The flash floods drain off as suddenly as they started.
And now the desert can settle down to enjoy the return of prosperity.
But still the animals show no sign of rejoicing.
It takes several days before it dawns on them that...
...paradise has returned to the desert.
Then their joy of living comes bursting out.

BOUZANO, a small village in Portugal
Forward!
Bring more wood. Put it there.
You wretched bastards!
You will die, you evil warlocks.
You will pay for all your crimes. Murderers!
You miserable fools!
We shall rise from the dead to seek revenge.
And we shall raze this town to the ground.
Murderer!
Burn all their eyes!
Burn them!
Let them burn! Murderers!
The Return of the Evil Dead
Come on, get that puppet ready.
Go get the firewood.
- Quickly.
- Yes.
Stop that! Get out of here!
Leave him alone!
Stop it! Enough!
Get out of here, you stupid troublemakers!
- Why do you defend that idiot?
- The poor devil.
- Wait at the plaza.
- I want to be alone with you.
Guys, come over here!
Jack Marlowe?
Did you hire me?
Dacosta, my right-hand man.
Vivian, my fiancée.
You wanted me to ask for references.
I used to be a captain.
Now I work with fireworks.
What would you like?
- A whiskey soda for me.
- Whiskey for everyone.
A beer for me.
- What are you celebrating here?
- The Burning Festival.
Ever since?
You people have a good memory.
It was the victory over the medieval warlocks.
According to tradition... tonight, the Eastern knights should leave their tombs... to raze this village to the ground.
- We should celebrate that with pride.
- Vivian?
I said I wanted a beer.
Mr. Duncan said whiskey for everyone.
We need you to hurry, Marlowe.
And this contract is important for your company.
The lady asked for a beer.
I have to think about my future.
Are you saving money, or are you thinking of marrying the mayor?
Both.
A new Vivian? Bourgeois? Respectable?
The owner of many farms.
Something like that.
Very edifying.
Thank you for not giving me away.
Coincidences are sometimes ironic.
Like running into each other in this village.
What do you mean?
- I falsified your references myself.
- Why?
We experienced something together.
The rest is pure sentimentality.
Everything?
Drinking and escaping reality.
Has it worked?
A bourgeois world, completely different from mine.
Right. There are two opposing possibilities.
Two idiots waiting for the lady to decide whether she takes it or leaves it.
Before you would have fought.
We came to see the ruins and then decided to take a break.
I see.
You only see the surface.
- Is there something deeper to see here?
- Yes.
The dead.
Quiet? You think so? Quiet.
They lost their eyes in horrible tortures.
But tonight...
They made a promise.
Sure, of course we remember.
A tale to frighten children.
The Templars brought the secret of eternal life from the East... and offered sacrifices to the supreme infernal powers.
Let me go!
The common people rose up against the knights and burned their eyes,,, so they wouldn't find their way back,
That's horrible.
- Today, destiny will be fulfilled.
- We're running late. Let's go.
- Why don't you come dancing a while?
- Yes.
I'll go. With the victors.
The ones who'll rule Bouzano.
Forget that story and get yourself a girlfriend.
I've already got one.
Light those in the back.
You must be sacrificed... just like the maidens before you were sacrificed by the Templars... so that they can live again.
It's necessary.
- Everything's calm.
- Where are you going?
I'm going to dance with my wife.
Go upstairs and let me know should anything come up.
All right. If that's what you want.
Well, well, Captain.
I thought you'd be gone by now.
I didn't want to miss the festival.
Have a drink and have fun.
You've earned it. Here.
No, thank you. I'd rather dance.
- Lf that's okay with you.
- My pleasure.
What are we going to do, Duncan?
Let him dance today, but he'd better be very far away tomorrow.
You'll go back to work.
You could come with me.
You want me to leave Duncan?
I can't ask anything of you.
You know there are no certainties with me.
It would be almost like an adventure.
I like risks and adventures.
Hurray!
I'm Murdo.
Do you remember me?
I'm your friend.
You wretched bastards. You've betrayed me.
Who is it?
Didn't I ask you not to come?
- You're still here?
- I had to bring water for tomorrow.
- Right.
- Besides, I had things to do.
- Many.
- Don't come in.
Come on, don't be nervous.
- Leave me alone.
- Why, my love?
If my father finds out...
- lf anyone catches us...
- Your father's having fun at the festival.
- That's what you think.
- Come on, darling. Come on.
- No. Not in my room.
- Don't be silly. Come on.
If my father finds out...
To us!
To our future.
- Is that your father?
- No, he's got a key.
- A neighbor?
- Everyone's at the festival.
Is it another guy?
- Hide quickly. Nobody should see you here.
- Go ahead.
Who is it?
Who is it?
- What's wrong?
- The window.
No! Don't open it!
No!
- We'd better leave right away.
- Why? Are you afraid of something?
There'll be complications.
I already told you, we'll leave as soon as we drink up.
Please, not like that. Drink calmly.
We have all the time we need.
Clerk!
Clerk!
Look at how you dressed up that horse, Moncha.
What a crazy idea.
It's a dead horse.
- The Templars have risen from the dead.
- Go back home and get some sleep.
Having a little too much to drink at a festival is not that serious.
You don't believe it? Well, you'll see.
Come on, gorgeous. Come on.
God almighty!
Hello?
Hello!
- We could be down there dancing.
- Yes, but orders are orders.
Answer, in the name of God.
- Wait.
- What?
- The phone is ringing.
- Leave it.
- It could be an emergency.
- Let them call back later.
Finish him, once and for all.
Don't worry. I'll teach him a good lesson.
I want to leave now.
I don't want to wait any longer.
Whatever you say.
Wait here.
Captain.
Stand aside.
I warned you.
You wanted to leave with him, didn't you?
- Please, let him go.
- Shut up!
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Prades is on the phone.
The ticket agent.
He says something terrible is going on.
The Express? Something must have happened on the train tracks.
Hey, you! Let him go. Come here. Now!
That's enough.
Jack, let's leave right away.
- There's been an accident at the station.
- That can't be.
The Express will be here in an hour.
He wants you to go right away.
It's a life-or-death emergency.
Follow me.
Hello. I don't understand a word he says.
He's drunk.
He's talking nonsense. Here.
Try to figure out what he means.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Don't waste any more time.
Call the city and ask the army for help.
Help!
He wants us to send in the army.
I heard the sound of glass breaking.
He's plastered.
Go to the station and take charge until the Express gets there.
- Take Beirao with you.
- Okay.
Go.
Hello, Prades. It's the Mayor.
Can you hear me?
Don't do anything and stay calm.
I'm sending you a replacement.
Can you hear me?
Please. Please, help me!
What's wrong?
- What are we going to do now?
- Take her to the village.
We can't leave her here.
- We're going back there?
- Yes, she needs to see a doctor.
Are you sure this is the right way to the station?
Yes. It's a bit rougher, but we'll get there faster.
- Did you hear that?
- It sounds like a storm.
- They're going towards the village.
- Hurry. We must warn them.
Come on, drink a little.
- We must find out what happened.
- Leave her for now. She's too scared.
You think something happened to my husband?
Don't be silly.
- Say something. We need to catch them!
- Leave the girl alone.
Don't you see she can't even talk?
I've told you before to mind your own business.
You think you'll scare me without your bodyguards?
- I'll show you...
- Enough.
You'll scare her with your fighting.
They're coming.
- Who?
- Mr. Dacosta and my husband.
Are you joking with me?
You think I'm going to buy that Templar story?
Mr. Duncan, I swear we saw them.
Ask Dacosta. They're heading this way.
- Believe him. We must evacuate the village.
- Are you both mad?
It's true. Believe it.
We must flee soon. They're very close.
We got a head start through the woods.
Amalia. Get our daughter.
- She's sleeping.
- It doesn't matter. Get her dressed.
We're leaving right now!
Here. Put this on.
Hello?
What's going to happen, Jack?
I don't know.
Careful.
- Who is it?
- It's me, sir.
- What is it?
- Bouzano's mayor is calling. It's urgent.
- I don't want any calls this late.
- He says it's serious.
Typhus again.
Hello?
- There's no one on the line.
- Oh, sorry.
I'm trying to reach the Commissioner of Soutarme.
I hope he picks up.
Hello? Yes, it's me. What is it, Duncan?
Of course. You think I don't know who the Templars were?
Dead guys on horses?
You're calling me at 1:00 a.m.
To tell me that?
It's true, Commissioner. My men saw them.
They want to attack the village just like they promised.
I won't tolerate jokes at this hour, or at any other time.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing, Commissioner. I await orders.
- No, not you.
- Excuse me.
- What is it?
- There's a festival in Bouzano.
They're celebrating the burning.
And they're drinking.
Mayor Duncan, are you drunk?
That's what's going on.
Sleep it off, and enjoy the festivities.
It's satisfying for me to see that the people are enjoying themselves... as compensation for their long days... of deeply productive work... for the prosperity of our national economy.
That's all.
Hey!
He thinks we're joking around.
- Nobody will listen to us today.
- We must flee as soon as possible.
The church.
Take a look at this!
What do you think?
Do you want to fight them?
You want them to hunt us without defending ourselves?
I'm with you, Captain. But just this once.
Let the slaughter continue. I'll stay here.
- Let's go.
- I'm going with you.
- Don't let them kill without a fight.
- Where are we going to go?
They're storming the houses.
Nowhere is safe.
- Abandon the village.
- We're surrounded. We can't escape.
The gate. We'll need to clear that passageway.
It's the only way we can escape.
Gather all the sticks, scythes, and rakes that you can find.
Follow me.
We're right here!
They're crazy, completely crazy.
They don't stand a chance.
See if there are any fireworks left.
Quick!
The fireworks!
We've got these left. They might be useful.
Get your people together. Hurry up!
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Thanks for everything.
We'll send help your way.
- Good luck.
- Let's go.
- Wait!
- Come on, Duncan. Get in.
Hurry. Let's go.
Careful.
Here, Mr. Duncan. Run!
- Quick!
- Moncha, hurry.
To the church. The church.
Come on, let's go.
- What's wrong? Are you hurt?
- Only a scratch.
Let the women go to the vestry and get any food they can find.
And the men, get something to break the benches and reinforce the windows.
Is that clear?
Yes, General. Help me.
- Mr. Duncan. You're hurt. Do you need help?
- Leave me alone.
Come.
We're surrounded.
How long can we keep this up?
I hope a villager escaped and can send us help.
- There's a first-aid kit right here.
- Put it aside. It may come in handy.
- We could also use this bottle of gasoline.
- We should keep it for an extreme case.
Keep looking, please.
Other than church wine,
I don't know what else we'll find here.
What is it?
Don't hurt me.
- What were you doing there?
- They betrayed me, too.
- Let him go. He's the abbey's keeper.
- Give me that.
- Why were you hiding?
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.
- Is it because of this?
- You didn't want to share.
- We'll ration the food.
We don't know when we'll get help.
- Watch out! They're trying to break in.
- Give it to Moncha.
Get some nails.
Hurry up. Don't just stand there.
- Murdo, hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Put it there.
Get ready.
Now!
Shut it.
Nails.
You women try to get some rest.
We'll stand guard.
You and Duncan, go up to the belfry to see if they'll try coming in that way.
Why should I take orders from you?
Somebody has to lead, and I think I'm the most qualified.
I'm with you, Captain.
All right. I won't object.
Good luck getting us out of this.
- I'll do what I can.
- Let's go, Dacosta.
Watch that side. Let me know of any strange movement.
I will.
Wait for me upstairs. I'm going to insist.
I'll call the Commissioner again.
Excellency?
It's Duncan. Forgive me for bothering you again.
We had to take refuge inside the church.
I'm happy you went to church.
A village that prays is a village that seeks salvation.
- What?
- Keep us in your prayers.
Those of us who have the responsibility and burden of power.
- That's all.
- Whatever you say, Excellency.
Hot chocolate at 10:30, as usual.
- Come with me.
- Where?
Come, and shut the door.
- What do you want?
- I want to help you.
You were the only who stood up for me.
See? That's a tunnel over there.
But the exit is closed.
I need your help to remove the rubble.
- And the others?
- Lf we all tried, we'd attract attention.
Alone, we have better odds of saving ourselves.
You'll leave them here?
If you want to come, fine.
If you want to die with them, fine.
- I'm not helping by staying here.
- You'll see. We'll be saved.
Help me.
Take that drawer. Don't wake her.
Take it to the closet.
Come in.
Pick it up.
Cigar?
Thank you.
How long are we going to listen to that idiot?
- Until someone comes to save us.
- You think?
- You don't?
- I rely on my own strength.
Do you have a special plan?
Come.
I have to stand guard.
What are you trying to do?
All right. Look at that.
Right. Marlowe's car.
Did you forget we couldn't use it?
There were a lot of us.
You want to get in with the Templars surrounding it?
We know they're afraid of fire.
If we got a torch, we'd be able to reach the road.
Perhaps one or two, but everyone?
Exactly. It'll be just you and me.
You're not thinking of leaving everyone else here.
- We don't have a choice.
- Vivian, too?
A woman would be an obstacle to our escape.
- Besides, she left me already.
- Leave on your own, if you can.
I'm not agile. My wound is very painful.
I wouldn't make it to the car.
I need you to carry the torch.
I won't leave Vivian here.
You want her, don't you?
You think I can't tell.
A whole year looking after her.
Loving her in silence.
Indulging her every whim.
What has she done for you in return?
She won't even treat you like a human being.
She fell in love with the first pretty boy that showed up.
Good for you, defending her.
Sacrifice your life for her.
You just want to see her sleep someone besides me.
Enjoy being humiliated!
Bastard.
Go. I won't kill you because I'm hoping they'll do it downstairs.
Beirao, I've been thinking about how horrible this is.
Yes, Mr. Duncan.
It's like a nightmare.
More for your wife and daughter than for us.
- Thank you, Mr. Duncan.
- But I think there's a possibility.
- How? Tell me...
- Keep quiet, Beirao.
Our lives depend on this secret, and your daughter's, too.
Don't worry. Nobody will find out.
I need the help of an agile man willing to take risks. A man like you.
I'd do anything for my family.
- What do I need to do?
- Get the car. We'll use it to escape.
- And the Templars?
- We'll need to scare them away with fire.
- I'll give it a shot...
- Wait a bit. I'll make sure the coast is clear.
- Why aren't you at your post?
- I was falling asleep.
Could you make us some coffee?
Yes.
How are things upstairs?
There are strange noises coming from the roof.
- Dacosta would like you to go check.
- Fine. Stay here, I'll go and see.
All right.
Light it.
Keep them back with this.
Let's go.
For your wife and daughter.
- What's he doing?
- Duncan sent him.
- Hi.
- Don't wake your mom. Your dad's waiting.
He's on the other side of the street.
He's got candy for you.
You want to go?
Yes.
- Call your dad.
- Dad!
Dad.
No!
Yes.
Look here.
They've left the door unattended. I'll go see.
What are you going to do if this turns out okay?
You used to be more formal with me.
Are you planning to leave with your captain?
That's none of your business.
Amalia.
Where's the girl?
I don't know. She must be with my husband.
Have you seen the girl?
No, I haven't.
- What's going on out there?
- Nothing. It's better you don't know.
Dad!
My daughter!
Mom.
- I'm right here. Can't you see me?
- Don't leave me here.
- She scared to cross the street. I'll get her.
- Careful. It may be a trap.
Mom, come here.
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
Let me go! I won't let them kill my daughter!
Calm down. I'll go.
Jack, please.
Calm down, Amalia.
- Are you scared?
- No.
- Why don't you come with me?
- I can't.
Stay still.
Leave my daughter alone!
You've got me now!
Cowards!
I dare you!
Wretched bastards! Murderers!
Mom!
Run!
We did it.
Help me.
Nobody's there.
Can we get out?
What's wrong?
Where are the keeper and Moncha?
They're nowhere to be found.
They must have escaped.
Which means it's come down to the three of us.
And the girl.
Right. And the girl.
- Nobody's come to help us yet.
- You're still hoping for that?
Aren't you?
Dawn will break soon.
How far do you think Ferreira is from here?
They've all been hunted down.
They're no use to us.
- And you so relaxed.
- Resigned.
I'm used to taking things as they come.
But everything has its compensation.
I don't see what could compensate for this nightmare.
You don't see it, do you? Well, I do.
I want to satisfy one of my greatest desires.
What are you trying to do?
You know what, honey.
You figured it out a long time ago.
I told you with my eyes.
- Shut up! I forbid you...
- Forbid what?
We're both going to die soon.
Stop this nonsense, and let's enjoy the moments we have left.
- Let me go or I'll scream.
- It's useless.
Your friend won't hear you from there.
Let me go.
We have an advantage with the light of dawn.
They're blind, so we can take advantage of that.
Are you up to it?
Anything's better than waiting to be killed.
We must walk very carefully... and avoid letting them hear us.
They killed my mom.
They were skulls.
- No, you were dreaming.
- No, I saw it.
You know what?
Your parents are waiting for you over there.
- Do you want to go with them?
- I want to see my mom.
All right. We'll go together.
You, me, and Vivian.
It's a really fun game.
First, I'll blindfold you. Okay?
Do you want to play with me?
But you can't make any noise.
- You have to walk very slowly, okay?
- Yes.
All right.
There you go.
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

[SEAGULLS CALLING]
[♪ Neil Diamond: Be]
[WIND HOWLING]
MALE SEAGULL: Why? Why can't I...?
[♪ Neil Diamond: Prologue]
MALE SEAGULL: That's not the answer.
I just can't flap my wings fast enough.
Maybe seagulls can't fly faster than 62 miles per hour.
But wouldn't it be great if we could?
I wonder how high I could really fly, what the world would look like from way up there.
My wings are heavy.
I don't feel steady.
[WIND WAILING]
I didn't fall all the way.
I can do it.
I've got to make it higher than anyone's ever flown before.
I can.
I can see everywhere.
How am I gonna tell them?
How am I gonna say it?
Mother, Father...
...I hope you'll understand.
This time you have to.
I've found things that will change our lives.
There's such a world out there.
None of us have ever seen it or felt it.
I've just flown up today higher than we ever fly, far above the highest clouds.
But you can see.
I mean, you can see everywhere.
For the first time in my life
I see where we live.
MOTHER: Son, we looked everywhere for you the last few days.
FATHER: The elders in the flock are talking about you.
MOTHER: They know you fly off on your own, where we never fly.
They don't understand it.
They will not allow it.
MALE SEAGULL:
Not allow me to learn? Why?
MOTHER: Oh, I can understand your dreams, Jonathan.
We all dream of better things when we're young.
I'm afraid...
...for you.
I'm afraid of what you're doing.
FATHER: Maybe this isn't the best life, but it's all we know.
Winter's coming.
The flock must stay together to survive.
We were meant to live the way we live, accept it.
Take your place.
Will you try, Son?
MOTHER: If you don't, we will have all lived for nothing.
JONATHAN: We weren't meant to live this way.
I know you're wrong.
But... I'll try.
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
[SCREECHING]
[♪ Neil Diamond: Flightof the Gull]
JONATHAN: Maybe the secret is fixed wings.
Flap up to 50 and hold the wings still.
I'll bet that's it.
Fifty and still.
It won't hurt anybody if I try that. Will it?
It won't hurt anybody, take away anybody's freedom if I just slip out and give it a try.
Nothing to worry about.
Just a very simple thing here.
I'm going to make a simple dive, to 50 miles per hour and hold the wings steady and go straight on down.
Here we go.
This is it.
Thirty, 40, 50...
No. No! Pull out!
I... I can't do it.
I'll be killed.
[WIND WAILING]
What is this? I'm afraid.
I'm on the right way of doing this, and I'm afraid.
So, what are you going to do?
You going to glide around here for the rest of your life without trying?
If you're scared, go back to the flock where everyone else is scared too.
Sixty... 70.
Faster than any seagull has ever...
Pull!
There's got to be more to life than fighting for some fish head somewhere.
There's no way around it.
If I was meant to learn so much about flying,
I'd have charts for brains.
If I were meant to fly fast,
I'd have a falcon's short wings, live on mice instead of fish.
I've got to live with what I am.
I promise this day that I will be a seagull...
...like every other seagull.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Dear Father]
Does my life end here?
I can't believe that.
I wasn't born to drown in this ocean.
I can die here, or I can force myself to fly.
[STRUGGLING] It's in me.
It's in me!
I've got to try.
I've got to get back home.
At last I can stop thinking, for once in my life.
Just stop thinking and fly towards the lights in the dark.
Dark?
Seagulls never fly in the dark.
Get down.
If you were meant to fly in the dark, you'd have the eyes of an owl.
You'd have charts for brains.
You'd have a falcon's short wings.
A falcon's short wings.
I dive on the wingtips only.
[WIND WAILING]
Why didn't I think?
Short wings. Short wings.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Dear Father]
Faster than any seagull anywhere. Ever!
I'll teach the others.
I'll show the flock how!
[WIND WAILING]
I did it!
It works.
Short wings all controlled. It works!
I must have hit 170 in the dive, and that was just a short dive.
What will I hit if I dive from 10,000 feet?
[♪ Neil Diamond: Skybird]
JONATHAN: A quick roll in, fold the wings, just the tips out in the air, take her straight down just like last night, and we'll see just how fast a seagull can fly.
- [WIND HOWLS]
- [SEAGULLS SQUAWK]
JONATHAN: One-eighty! One-ninety!
Oh, God! The flock!
Look out!
[ALL SCREECH]
The elders. The whole flock.
They believe me now.
They finally understand.
ELDER: Jonathan Livingston Seagull...
...you have been called here to be judged in the sight of your flock.
Jonathan Gull, for your reckless flying, for refusing to join the flock to which you were born, for turning your back upon the traditions of your flock, assembled here.
JONATHAN: I haven't turned my back.
I want to share what I've found with all of you.
ELDER: Jonathan Livingston Seagull, you do not live as we live.
You do not fly as we fly.
You do not believe as we believe.
You will learn that life is the unknown and the unknowable.
We are put into this world to survive any way we can, as long as we can.
JONATHAN: I don't believe that.
ELDER: Jonathan Seagull, the brotherhood is broken.
Never again will you see any of your flock.
Never again will you have the protection of your flock.
You are henceforth and forever outcast!
JONATHAN: Outcast.
- MOTHER: Jonathan.
- FATHER: Why, Jonathan? Why?

JONATHAN: Who are you?
1ST MALE GULL: Hello, Jonathan.
We're from your new flock.
We're your brothers.
We've come to show you a higher place.
JONATHAN: I don't have any flock.
I'm old, I'm tired.
I can't fly any higher.
2ND MALE GULL: But you can, Jonathan.
For you have learned.
One school is finished, and it is time for another to begin.
JONATHAN: Oh...
...I see.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Anthem]
JONATHAN: Am I an outcast here too?
FEMALE GULL: Jonathan, we've come to take you home.
It's time to begin.
JONATHAN: I don't know quite where I am.
Have I slept a long time?
FEMALE GULL: Only for a short while.
I'm Maureen, your instructor here.
We're going to learn together.
JONATHAN: Maureen.
Your name came into my mind even before you said it.
MAUREEN: Welcome home.
JONATHAN: Home?
I've never been here before.
MAUREEN: Maybe not.
Feels like home though, doesn't it?
JONATHAN: Everything feels different.
Where is everybody?
Why aren't there more of us here?
MAUREEN: The only answer I can see,
Jonathan, is that you were pretty well a one-in-a-million bird.
Most of us came along ever so slowly.
We went from one world into another that was almost exactly like it, forgetting right away where we'd come from, not caring where we were headed, living for the moment.
Do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating or fighting or power in the flock?
Many lives, Jon.
And then other lives to learn that there is such a thing as perfection.
And others again, to finally get the idea that our purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth.
But you, Jonathan, learned so much at one time that you didn't have to go through 100 lives to reach this one.
JONATHAN: My life back there,
I don't remember very well.
Everything's blurred, I...
All those years.
MAUREEN: Cast out? Alone?
JONATHAN: Yes. But it was a fine life.
MAUREEN: Didn't you say you know me from somewhere?
I believe there were many somewheres.
I know what it is to speak, to feel and never to be heard.
JONATHAN: Can I really learn to fly without limits?
MAUREEN: Maybe you'll find something that will mean even more to you than flying without limits.
To learn what perfection really is.
Let's try some real flying now.
You're adjusting very well to your new body, and to the air here.
It's almost time for you to meet the elders here.
JONATHAN: I don't want to see an elder as long as I...
Well...
MAUREEN: Are you afraid to say "live"?
Have you ever felt more alive? Happier?
JONATHAN: No, that's... that's just the point. I...
I don't want any elder telling me what I can't do.
MAUREEN: This is your new flock,
Jonathan.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Be]
JONATHAN: What was that?
Maureen?
Look up there.
MAUREEN: Oh, I was afraid he'd gone away.
Jonathan, that's Chiang.
Not bad, for a feeble old elder.
JONATHAN: Maureen, I never saw anyone fly like that.
CHIANG: Good evening, Maureen.
Jonathan.
MAUREEN: Good evening, Chiang.
JONATHAN: Hello, sir.
It's an honour to meet you.
CHIANG: The honour is mine,
Jonathan Seagull.
Maureen.
He learns well?
MAUREEN: A little impatient is all.
He knows everything I know.
And more now.
JONATHAN: Maureen, how can you say that? I have so much to learn.
You know so much more than I.
MAUREEN: Jonathan, you know it now.
You still need to practise smoothness and patience, but you know the flying very well.
JONATHAN: I still have questions.
CHIANG: Ask whatever you want.
JONATHAN: I... Well...
Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?
Where we are now.
It isn't heaven at all.
CHIANG: Who said it was?
Heaven isn't a place.
Heaven's perfection.
Wouldn't you think?
And we don't go there, as much as we express it.
Does that sound true to you?
JONATHAN: Yes.
I suppose.
CHIANG: You're a very fast flyer.
JONATHAN: Well, I...
I enjoy travelling quickly, but I don't like limits.
I want to fly faster than I can now and higher and learn more.
I can fly 276 miles per hour now.
Level. That's pretty fast, but it's not fast enough.
Don't ask me why, but it just isn't fast enough.
CHIANG: What is fast enough, Jonathan?
You who are impatient to be perfect.
What is perfect speed?
JONATHAN: Well...
...perfect speed.
CHIANG: A thousand miles per hour?
That's a limit.
A million miles an hour?
That's a limit.
Speed of light?
That's a limit too.
JONATHAN: They're all limits.
CHIANG: Perfect speed, my son, isn't moving fast at all.
Perfect speed is being there.
So...
JONATHAN: Maureen, did you see that?
MAUREEN: He says we can all learn that, whenever we want to learn it.
The next life maybe.
CHIANG: It is not so difficult,
Jonathan, once we understand.
JONATHAN: I want to understand, now.
What does it feel like?
How far can you go?
CHIANG: To any place, to any time that you wish to go.
I've gone everywhere and every-when I can think of.
After a while, one begins to think that space and time are not quite real.
JONATHAN: Can you teach me to fly like that?
CHIANG: Of course. If you want to learn.
JONATHAN: Yes, I want.
When can we start? I'll do anything.
Maureen, did you see...?
I've got to learn.
How do you do it?
I mean, how...?
CHIANG: First, you let your teacher get a word in edgewise.
JONATHAN: I'm sorry, Chiang.
It's just that all my life...
I can't explain it.
...I've had this...
This need to know.
CHIANG: To fly as fast as thought, to anywhere that is now, or ever has been or ever will be, you begin by knowing that you've already arrived.
JONATHAN: I beg your pardon?
I am already there, on that highest peak.
I am not limited by any body.
I am not limited by space.
I am not limited by time.
I am a perfect expression of freedom, here and now.
All right, here I go.
I am going right... now!
Now!
Now?
MAUREEN: Jonathan?
Can I bring you anything?
JONATHAN: No.
Nothing.
I have to do this.
I don't care how long
I have to stand here, I will do it.
CHIANG: Would you like to take a break?
JONATHAN: Good evening, sir, I...
I'm concentrating as hard as I can.
I just can't get it.
CHIANG: Jon, you don't need faith.
You don't need faith to fly.
You need to understand flying, don't you?
To learn certain facts about things you cannot see.
This is just the same.
JONATHAN: I am a perfect expression of freedom and flight.
Why am I thinking that way?
This isn't some ritual.
Real is real.
I really am a perfect idea.
It works. It really works.
CHIANG: Well, of course it works,
Jonathan.
It always works when you know what you're doing.
Now, about your control...
Well, it's different anyway.
JONATHAN: We're trapped in here.
There's no way out of here.
CHIANG: Jonathan, there's a way out.
JONATHAN: Oh... yes.
But why did I come here at all?
CHIANG: Like attracts like.
Wherever your thought is, that is where your body is going to be, sooner or later.
You're just learning to do it sooner.
Did you want to be walled away, to think this over?
Here you are.
Try it again.
And hold your thought on something you've always loved.
JONATHAN: I know things I love, but I'm not sure.
CHIANG: Do it. I'm with you.
JONATHAN: I have always liked stars.
CHIANG: It is a fine view.
And a good place to be alone.
But so much of love is giving, don't you think?
Sharing the very best you know with someone who's trying to learn.
Try it again, and this time, think giving.
No special names or place.
Just think love and see where you turn up.
JONATHAN: Oh... Ready?
CHIANG: Any time.
JONATHAN: What's this?
What's happening?
My old flock. I don't love them.
CHIANG: Don't you, Jonathan?
JONATHAN: Well, I always did want to give them what I'd learned about flying, if that's what you mean by love, but I never found the way.
CHIANG: When the time is right for you to give to them, nothing can keep it from happening.
When it's wrong, nothing can make it be.
JONATHAN: I can't see how that can ever happen.
CHIANG: Don't worry about it.
Try it, once more now.
Think love and being in the place that's right for you to be now.
JONATHAN: Oh... Hello, Maureen.
MAUREEN: Hello, Jonathan.
CHIANG: The time's come for me to leave you.
There are others I must help.
And there is more for me to learn.
JONATHAN: You can't leave now.
I've only begun.
CHIANG: Jonathan Seagull, someday you will know how long ago your flight began and how great a journey you have travelled.
Now you are ready to begin the most difficult and the most powerful journey of all.
You are ready to fly up and know the meaning of kindness and love.
Jonathan, you were born to be a teacher, to give the truth to anyone struggling to break out of his limits.
It is important to give what you have found, as a gift, to whomever will accept it.
JONATHAN: Chiang, I know
I'll see you again.
CHIANG: Of course you will, and, Jonathan, keep working on love.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Be]
MAUREEN: What's the matter?
JONATHAN: How much more I would've known, if someone like Chiang had come along the day
I was an outcast.
What a different life I would have had.
What a different life the flock back there would've had.
Maureen, I have to go back.
MAUREEN: We're always parting.
We're always saying goodbye.
JONATHAN: I know you don't want me to go.
I know my old flock doesn't care what flying is.
They don't care about learning.
They don't care about looking beyond what they see with their eyes, but, Maureen, there's got to be somebody in that time who cares.
MAUREEN: Jonathan, go with my love.
JONATHAN: Maureen, goodbye for now.
MAUREEN: I love who you are, Jonathan.
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
ELDER: Fletcher Lynd Seagull, you were born to us, but you are not part of us.
You cry against the flock and against the law.
You ask questions, answered 1,000 years ago.
You do not wish the protection of the flock.
And you shall not have it.
You are henceforth and forever...
...outcast!
FLETCHER: I don't want your protection.
You're gonna wish you never...
All your "henceforth and forever."
It's not gonna be me who needs protection.
It's not gonna be me!
I don't care what they say.
There's one hell of a lot more to flying than just flapping around from A to B.
A mosquito can do that.
One little barrel roll around the elder to show him what's possible, and I'm outcast.
Can't they see?
Can't they... they think of the glory it'll be when we really find out how to fly?
Damn the flock.
I'll be outlaw all right.
Outlaw like they never saw before.
I'll make them so sorry.
JONATHAN: Don't hurt them,
Fletcher Seagull.
FLETCHER: Who are you?
JONATHAN: In casting you out, the other gulls have only hurt themselves, and one day they will know this, and one day they will see what you see.
Forgive them and help them understand.
FLETCHER: I don't understand.
JONATHAN: Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to learn to fly?
Do you want to fly so much that you will forgive the flock? And learn?
And go back to them one day and help them know?
FLETCHER: I do!
JONATHAN: Then, Fletcher, let's begin with level flight.
We're all outcasts.
We're all friends.
We're learning to fly just for the fun of it.
Take your time.
Your whole body from wingtip to wingtip is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see.
Break the chains of your thought, and you break the chains of your body too.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Skybird]
JONATHAN: That's fine, Fletcher.
Judy Lee.
Fly it nice and loose until you get used to formation flying.
We'll just go on practicing, and you can slide in closer whenever you feel like it.
Fletcher, it's time to go.
FLETCHER: Time to go where, Jonathan?
JONATHAN: Back to the flock.
We have a gift to give.
FLETCHER: But we're not ready.
We're not welcome.
Jonathan, we're outcast.
We can't force ourselves where we're not welcome, can we?
And it's the law of the flock!
JONATHAN: We're free to go where we wish and to be what we are.
FLETCHER: Why bother with the flock?
Seagulls are the laziest, dirtiest, most vicious...
JONATHAN: Suspicious, clumsiest.
A seagull hardly knows how to walk.
But don't you see, Fletcher?
A seagull wasn't made to walk.
He was made to fly, and when he learns to fly, he's the purest, loveliest, most graceful creature alive.
True for you, true for me, true for all the flock.
We can soar free across the sky, but how often we don't want to.
That's the gift we can give, to help those who want to learn find what they love to do.
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
ELDER: It is the law of the flock that an outcast never returns.
Anyone who follows them, anyone who listens to them, anyone who turns his back on the flock will be outcast too!
JONATHAN: I only wish to share what I've learned.
The very simple fact that it is right for a gull to fly because freedom is the very nature of his being.
Whatever stands against that freedom must be set aside.
We don't need ritual and superstitions to live.
ELDER: The law of the flock decides!
JONATHAN: Do you speak of law?
Is it the law which decrees we must fight among ourselves just to feed on garbage?
It can't be!
The only true law is that which sets us free.
There can be no other.
MALE GULL: How can you expect us to fly as you fly?
You are special and gifted and divine, above other birds.
JONATHAN: Look at Fletcher,
Charles-Roland, Judy Lee.
Are they also special and gifted and divine?
No more than you are.
No more than I am.
The only difference, the very only one, is that they have begun to understand what they really are and have begun to practise it.
MALE GULL: What if we could fly like that?
ELDER: They're outcasts. Ignore them.
- Don't listen to him. Ignore him!
- [ALL SQUAWK]
Ignore them.
Ignore them all. They're outcasts.
Anyone who looks upon an outcast breaks the law of the flock!
Ignore them.
Ignore him!
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
[♪ Neil Diamond: Dear Father]
JONATHAN: Each of us finds and follows what we most love to do, no matter what others think.
And this brings us automatically to discover more of who we really are.
There's a law there, a principle like aerodynamics, that simply does not fail.
You can count on it.
- YOUNG GULL: Help me.
- JONATHAN: Hello, Kirk Maynard.
KIRK: I want to fly more than anything in the world. Please.
JONATHAN: We can start learning right now.
KIRK: You don't understand. My wing.
I can't move my wing.
JONATHAN: You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.
KIRK: Are you saying I can fly?
MALE GULL: Kirk Maynard can't fly.
He was born crippled.
- He's never been off the ground.
- JONATHAN: You're free, Kirk Maynard.
Fly.
Fly!
[♪ Neil Diamond: Flightof the Gull]
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
KIRK: I can fly.
I can fly!
Listen, I can fly.
I can fly!
MALE GULL: Fletcher says he'll come right down here in front of us at 200 miles an hour.
Just to prove it.
If he can learn it, I can learn it.
FEMALE GULL: I'll believe it when he shows us how.
2ND MALE GULL: Sorry,
I just don't believe it.
A normal seagull like you and me is not meant to fly at 200 miles an hour.
2ND FEMALE GULL:
Somewhere up there Fletcher's flying.
I've known him since he was your age.
BABY GULL: I'm afraid, Mother.
I want to go with you.
MOTHER GULL: Stay here.
I want you safe.
FLETCHER: Here we go.
They won't believe it till they see it with their eyes, till we prove it especially for them.
MALE GULL: Listen, we should be able to hear him.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- Quiet, I think I hear him.
FLETCHER: I'm ready.
[WIND HOWLING]
- MALE GULL: Here he comes!
- FEMALE GULL: Do you believe now?
- MALE GULL: I can't.
- BABY GULL: Mother! Where are you?
MALE GULL: Look at that baby bird! He's in Fletcher's way! He'll get killed!
[SCREECHING]
[WIND HOWLING]
[FLETCHER GROANING] Oh.
I had to.
I would have hit him.
- But why?
- JONATHAN: The trick, Fletcher, is that we're trying to overcome our limitations in order, patiently.
We don't go flying through rock until a little later in the programme.
FLETCHER: Jonathan!
JONATHAN: Also known as the Son of the Great Gull?
FLETCHER: What are you doing here?
The... The cliff.
There was a... a baby gull gliding down.
Haven't I...?
Didn't I... die?
JONATHAN: Oh, Fletcher, come on, think.
If you're talking to me now, then obviously you didn't die, did you?
You merely changed your level of thinking... rather abruptly.
It's your choice now. You can stay here and learn on this level, which is quite a bit higher than the one you left, by the way, or you can go back and keep working in the flock.
The elders were hoping for some kind of disaster, but they're startled that you would oblige them so well.
FLETCHER: I want to go back to the flock.
Of course! There's a new group...
I haven't even begun.
JONATHAN: You're sure you wouldn't rather stay?
FLETCHER: Let's get going.
JONATHAN: All right, Fletcher.
Remember what we were saying about our body being nothing more than thought itself?
Fletcher.
Fletcher?
FLETCHER: It's true.
Jon, I'm beginning to see.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- FEMALE GULL: He's alive!
2ND FEMALE GULL: He touched him with a feather. Brought him to life!
MALE GULL: He is the Son of the Great Gull.
ELDER: It's a trick!
Don't listen to him!
- [EXCITED CHATTER]
- ELDER: He's a devil!
He's the devil!
MALE GULL: He is the devil.
He is the devil!
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
ELDER: I tell you he is the devil!
He can destroy us all!
He can destroy the flock!
Kill him!
Kill him!
[ALL SHOUTING]
ELDER: Kill him!
[ALL SCREECHING]
ELDER: Kill him!!
Kill him!!
JONATHAN: Would you feel better if we left?
FLETCHER: They wanted to kill us!
How did we get away?
JONATHAN: Like everything else,
Fletcher, practice.
FLETCHER: I don't understand. The flock was gonna kill us. Our own flock!
Why? Remember what you said about loving the flock enough to return to them and help them live?
They wanted us dead.
They're a mob. They're killers.
How can you love them?
JONATHAN: You don't love hatred and evil, of course.
You have to practise and see the good in every one of them and help them see it in themselves.
That's what we mean by love.
It's fun... when you get the idea of it.
I remember a fierce young bird, for instance.
Fletcher Lynd Seagull, his name.
Just been made outcast, ready to fight the flock to the death, getting a start on building his own bitter hell out on the far cliffs.
And here he is today, building his own heaven instead and leading the whole flock in that direction.
FLETCHER: Me? Leading?
You're the instructor here.
You can't leave us.
JONATHAN: Don't you think there might be other flocks, other Fletchers that need an instructor now more than this one?
FLETCHER: But me, Jon?
I'm just a plain seagull, and you're...
JONATHAN: Oh, yes, yes, I know. The only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose.
Fletcher, you don't need me anymore.
All the younger ones in the flock and some of the others too are ready to follow you now.
All you need is to keep finding the real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull.
He's your instructor.
And don't let them spread silly rumours about me or try to make me some sort of a god, will you, Fletcher?
I'm a seagull. I like to fly, maybe.
FLETCHER: Jonathan.
JONATHAN: We both have learned what we were meant to learn in our time together, Fletcher.
That the way to find perfection and love is within us.
Look with your understanding.
Find out what you already know.
Use it, Fletcher.
Teach it, show it forth.
And you'll know the way to fly.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Be]

- magnolia!
- "magnolia"? and where are... the legal guardians of these waifs? their folks passed away back east is what i get from 'em. they've been shipped out here to john wintle. he's their second uncle, or something. and where is john wintle? halfway to san francisco, i'd say. all i know is, the stage made delivery... to the consignee or his agent, and that seems to be you, mister. what youdowith them is your business. that argument wouldn't hold up in any court of law, and you know it. it would in my court, and i'm the law around here. but, sheriff, look. sheriff, i didn't know they were children. now, i'm not a family man. mister, i gotta go. yeah, just as soon as we get this straightened out. now, sheriff, i-- i have no-- i have no place to keep them. wintle's got a shack on the edge of town.

"unfortunately, mr. bradley's lingering illness left him destitute,
"and there are no monies left in the estate.
"however, mr. bradley felt that revenues from his share of the commodore mine... would more than provide for the care and well-being of his children." i guess when wintle got this, he didn't want to be saddled with the kids, so he decided on a change of scenery. anything would be an improvement. yeah. well, now, the way that i see it, until we know one way or the other, uh, exactly what wintle had in mind, the children are wards of this town, right? wrong. there is no funds nor facilities for orphans in quake city. well, you don't expect me to be able to take care-- donavan, this is just a half-portion of a town, but we do have certain what you might call rules to live by. well, i-- you don't jump another man's claim. you don't steal his wife, woman or whiskey. you don't strike a bargain... and then entertain second thoughts about the matter. any one of these offenses can make you... the exalted guest of honor at a hemp party. uh-- no, i'd say you'd best... keep these youngsters or provide... for their safekeeping. well, it's time i was getting back to my barbershop. oh, and, uh, donavan, i wouldn't go on no long rides if i was you. no. no.

"commodore mine, december 3, 1871."
- commodore's our mine now.
- well, it's just an old ore sample.
- is it valuable?
- if it was, it wouldn't be here. our dad said there's gold in the commodore mine. everyone says there's gold in their mine. what's that? it's salt pork-- i think.
- it looks like fat.
- well, whatever it is, it's dinner.
- that's dinner?
- that's dinner. couldn't you make us apple dumplings instead? no. why not? because even if i could make apple dumplings, i wouldn't make them for you or anybody else. bobby? it's raining on celia again. then move celia again! there's no more dry places to move her. bobby, w-- oh, no, not my salt pork. what have i done to deserve this? who are you talking to? it doesn't matter. i don't think he's listening to me anyway. evenin'. had some extra son-of-a-gun stew. was either throw it out or bring it up here. huh. stopped raining. you know, it's really amazing. what is? the way those kids settled right down for you. well, when you're dead on your feet and you get your belly full, you get sleepy.
- what's amazing about that?
- oh, you underestimate yourself. i think i can say without hesitation... that was the best son-of-a-gun stew that i've ever had. really? yeah, and you saw the way the kids polished off their plates. you know, i think it's a crime... that someone with your culinary talent-- well, i guess you'd really have to call it magic-- hasn't a family to share it with. you tryin' to dump those kids on me, or you workin' on somethin' else? i am merely trying to point out... that you have a natural way with children. you're barkin' up the wrong tree, mister. my advice to you is, get yourself a job and look after your kids.
- they're not my kids!
- yes, they are, till you find somebody else to take 'em off your hands. night. it's dripping on me again. oh. i, uh, i'm very attached to the little fellas, but i'm, uh, i'm a bachelor, you see, and i'm really in no position to care for them, not like you and your attractive wife could. i'm sure there must be room here for three small children. it would just be until mr. wintle gets back. hey! ma'am, i can-- oh, get out of the way! come on! come on! get outta there! get out! why? don't get your feet wet. i'm really very attached to the little fellas, you see, but i'm in no position to care for them. howdy, ma'am. good morning. but they're all healthy specimens, sound of wind and limb. they don't eat much. they'd be a lot of help around here.
- they could-- no!
- ow! i can explain about that. uh, he's the only one that does that. you see, he's just a little sensitive, that's all. uh, no, really! the other ones-- come on. get out! ma'am, that little girl could help you in the kitchen. she could wash your dishes and scrub your personal clothes! come on. good day, sir. i can see that you're a man of substance. i have an interesting proposition i thought that might--
- ah. the lady of the house. kids. yech! the children are marvelous about parties. they love parties themselves. come on. if you could just-- one small look at them-- who was that, mr. donavan? the president of the garden club. all right, come on. mr. donavan? look! get out of there!
- celia! bein' a family man's quite a responsibility.
- i'm hungry.
- naturally. hard times cafe serves a nice lunch. thanks. come on, kids. come on. pair of tens wants the money. doggone. i guess that sure beats ace, queen high. well, i'm on my last card too. all right, you kids find something to do, and stay out of trouble.

- i'm sure you'll understand, belle.
- you're gonna sell it? i might raise a little investment capital on it, should the need arise. if you'd go get the gold in the commodore mine, you could keep the cherished token of a lady's affection. there is no gold in that hole in the ground. if there was, someone would have found it years ago. and i don't have to answer... to three whelps who aren't even dry behind the ears yet.
- mr. donavan?
- what?
- i gotta go.
- you just went.

- no.
- but why? because my head hurts, and because there is no gold in that hole in the ground. our pa said there was. then you go get it. and i'm going to go get some sleep. you know, leonard, with the kind of luck you have, you ought to play poker for a living... and have banking as a hobby, instead of the other way around. thank you, friend. thank you very much. hey, mr. donavan, why does he got... your cherished token of a lady's affection? because three deuces beats aces over eights, that's why. don't get in trouble. theodore! theodore! theodore! go on, clarice. go hide, quick! douse that fire! ah! what's the matter with you? what are you doing? did you lose your-- come on! there's a posse after us! here! come on! a posse? i don't see anybody. they're down there, all right. i saw 'em. they're all hidin' in the bushes. how many? i don't know. it was five, six. maybe 20. and they're all loaded for bear too. got those big, long buffalo rifles. you know somethin', amos? hmm? we gotta make a decision. what? does the hash knife outfit throw in its hand, or do we go out in a blaze of glory? right! uh, just what do you mean,

- bye. amos, that is the most humiliating thing that's ever happened to me. i know. three bitty kids with shovels... walk right into our hideout and get the drop on us. i know. and you burnt my hand, amos. i'm sorry about that. and you scorched a hole in my best shirt! well, i can fix that. why did you tell me those three bitty kids was a posse? well, i thought i saw 'em down there in the bushes. oh, you couldn't see through a barbed wired fence. theodore? that head of yours wouldn't hold straw. theodore? you couldn't sell hacksaws in a jail. what about that big roundup in the sky? i don't want to talk about it! i said i-- i said i-- said you were gonna spread your blanket next to mine. w- why don't we dig here? because somebody already did dig here. you scared? no. no more than you are. i'm not scared. neither am i. i am. bobby? come on. a little mouse can't hurt you. it was just an owl. this looks like a pretty good place to dig. you start over there, and i'll dig here. find any gold yet? nope. did you? no. maybe there ain't any gold, like mr. donavan said. pa said there was. stop shaking it, celia! i'm not shaking it! it won't stand still! it's an earthquake! let's get out of here! bobby? i gotta go. are we trapped? there must be another way out. come on. bobby, what's that? well, we base our evaluation... on what the price of the gold was when we checked last, but the price may have gone up in the meantime, in which case the nugget could be worth more. the san francisco mint will give us a receipt for the nugget, and the cash deposit will remain in the children's name in the quake city bank. i'll leave that end of it to you. i just want to make sure... that the children's interests are well protected. ah, donavan, don't worry about a thing. we'll see that that nugget is well taken care of. can we touch it? i'm sorry, ma'am. that's as close as we can let you get to it. it's a piece of cake. you mean it ain't gold? course it's gold, stupid. i mean getting that nugget out of that bank's gonna be easier than fallin' off a log. oh, boy! act natural. don't do nothin' to attract attention. hey, uh, theodore, how we gonna-- theodore? how, uh-- how we gonna get it outta that bank? all right, first we gotta get ourselves a long ladder, and we're gonna go in through the skylight, through the roof. then we gotta get that nugget outta town, and i figure if it's worth $87,000, it ought to-- oh, i'd say it'd weigh close to-- let's see. gold is $15 an ounce. how many ounces in a pound? are you listening to me, amos? yeah, but-- yeah, but what? your rear end's on fire, theodore. oh, thank you. ah! ow! why didn't you tell me my rear end was on fire? well, you told me not to do anything to attract attention. you got a match? i've got-- excuse me. ah! ah! hello. nice day. mabel, stanley, donavan. hello. hi, sheriff. well, now, this is what i call havin' a party. mr. donavan said we can have all the apple dumplings we want. did he? did he? well, that's very generous of mr. donavan. and he bought me a new dress, see? oh, i think that's the most beautiful dress i ever saw. awful nice kids. yes, they are. you still bound for new orleans? oh, yes. yes. well, nothing's happened to change that. of course, uh, i have a few things i have to clear up here in town, and i've gotta make arrangements for the kids. seems a lot of people... are anxious to take the youngsters to their bosoms. they're sayin' the kids ought to be made wards of the court... and for me to give 'em to some respectable family around here, people of substance.
'course, that'd fit right into your plans. you'd be free to go on your way. unencumbered. unfettered. yeah. yeah. fine, fine. who wants 'em? oh, there's no shortage of applicants.
- there's the little darlin'!
- here, let me have the sweet little thing! what do you know about children? you don't know nothin' about the child. let go! all right, ladies. ladies, this is a private party! but he said i could have her! you're all gonna wind up in the calaboose if you don't get out of here. that'll all be decided later on at the hearing. out! out! see what i mean? they ripped my beautiful dress. i know, but we'll fix it. hey. we'll fix it. there'sgotto be better people in this town. there's always miss clydesdale. who's miss clydesdale? dusty? mm-hmm.
- but she's not married.
- that's easy to fix. well, who can you get? you're not suggesting-- i'm only suggesting it for the kids. i know, but dusty's-- dusty's a fine specimen of womanhood! i seen her get caught in a cloudburst once, and i wanna tell you! yes, mr. donavan. please marry dusty. no two people ever got married... for a more honorable or worthy cause, donavan. think that over. hearing's not till the day after tomorrow. marry dusty? if they give us to mrs. stockley, she won't hit us with a stick, will she? why would she hit you with a stick? she hits mr. stockley with a stick, and she might get mad if we track mud in the house or something. or forget to comb our hair. well, i'm sure she wouldn't do that. when mr. stockley gets mad, he uses words i never heard before. he's not as mean as mr. leach. mr. leach'll put you in a sack and throw you in the river if you even talk too much. nobody's gonna throw you in the river. if rowdy joe dover got us, i bet we'd have to sleep in his shed. don't worry, clovis. if celia gets pneumonia, i can take care of her. we picked these for you, mr. donavan. so you won't forget us when you get to new orleans. you can press them in a book and they'll keep forever. then every time you see one, you'll remember us three "widdle" kids. that you gave away. come on, clovis. we better do the dishes and not bother mr. donavan anymore. all right! i'll ask her.
"three 'widdle' kids"? three little swindlers, you mean. bobby? what? what's "swindlers"? i don't know. okay, come on. come on! soon as we get the ladder out of here, we head straight for the bank. amos! amos! yeah? ahh! this one's too small. get the one on the other side. mmmm-- i'll go open the door. it's too long. we can't get it out this way. push it together. aah! you idiot! you get on that end, and i'll get on the other... and then we'll push it together. on the count of three. get in there and get it out! it went through the other window. i'm gonna pull it all the way through. someone's comin'! howdy. evening. don't worry. as soon as we get across here, it's gonna be all downhill. get back, you cabbage head. you're gonna bust it. don't worry. aah! mmm! it's a long way down there, theodore. well, don't look down. it's startin' to shake! hoo! don't do that. move it! my spur's caught. get up there! i am. i d-- aah-ha! get off! get off! if i didn't think you'd freeze to death come this winter, i'd rob this bank myself and leave you here. comin' through. watch it! uh-- maybe you ought to check and see if the front door's open. will you shut up? perfect. it's a great scheme. only when it's over, i'm the deserted wife left with three kids to mother... while i watch your south end disappearing over a hill. but you'll be compensated for any inconvenience, any-- i don't want their money. it's theirs. they found it. agreed. the only reason i suggested it is that i knew... that you would provide them with a good home. what do you get out of this "arrangement"? a chance to get to new orleans before winter sets in.
- that all?
- well, i would appreciate it if you'd square my debts. i will repay you in due time.
- and that's all?
- yes! oh, now wait a minute. uh, do you mean... might i exercise my husbandly prerogatives? that's exactly what i mean. miss clydesdale, nothing could be further from my mind. this marriage would ensure a good home for those children. nothing more. i give my word as a gentleman. it's not the best guarantee i've ever had. well, maybe not, but it's the best i have to offer. so what's it gonna be, miss clydesdale? you calling or folding? all right, i'll go along with it. but it's not for you. it's for the kids. and the sooner you light a shuck out of this town, the better. it's gonna be daylight before we even get in that bank. boy, once we get our hands on that gold, we're gonna be livin' like kings. we'll be shooin' those senoritas off like flies. never mind about that now. just make sure this mule of yours don't get frisky. don't you worry about clarice. she'll get you up there all right. now you wait for my signal. all right. you gonna use that hooty-owl again? now i answer with a whippoorwill. no, no. don't you remember nothin'? when i give that rope a tug, then you haul me up. that's a new one. right. tug and haul. right. okay. no hooty-owl. okay! now this time, it's just gonna be a tug and haul. you got that? well, that's it. come on, clarice. come on! hold it. stay right there. shh! you're gonna wake somebody up! come over here! uh! i'll help you. stay right there. whoa. you all right? i told you to wait for my signal! right. shh-shh. shh-shh. shh-shh. yeah. go ahead! shh-shh. yeah. uh, come on, clarice. come on. come on. get up, clarice. come on, you-- come on. get up, clarice. come on. you can rest on your patio when we get to mexico. come on. gotta get up now. come on. come on! mr. donavan said he doesn't want us wandering around-- somebody's coming! we're not wandering around. we're looking for him.

'cause i wanna stand on my toes. now get outta here. well, you kids go ahead now. i'm real busy.

- and, donavan?
- yeah? i'm sorry i hit you in the head with the spittoon. a perfectly logical misunderstanding. and i'm sorry that i offered you a drink in the saloon too. well, it's a perfectly logical misunderstanding. well, i wouldn't make that mistake again. you wouldn't? good luck, dusty. how you expect to get warm sittin' in front of a fire that's been out for two days? aw, i don't know. i always used to sit here for breakfast. couldn't we build just one little itty-bitty fire? it don't seem like home no more. no! amos, i tell you. we got big trouble. we go in town to get food, we get strung up. if we stay here, we starve to death, if we don't freeze to death first. so what's it gonna be? well-- well, what if we went down and told sheriff mccoy... that we was real sorry and we wasn't gonna rob banks anymore? ever. right. and we'd even cross our heart. well, that's worth thinkin' about. we wouldn't want to take any ropes with us, would we? hey, mister. what do you kids want now? you tell him, bobby. we want you to have our gold nugget.
- what gold nugget?
- the one you tried to steal.
- oh, that gold nugget.
- all you gotta do is take it out of the bank. you kids come all the way up here just to tell us to rob the bank again? we're already sentenced to be hung for robbin' it the first time. say, uh, maybe it's a fix to smoke us out, theodore. this isn't any trick. judge mccoy said mr. wintle really doesn't want us. he just wants the gold. so if you take the gold, then mr. wintle will go away again. and mr. donavan will be stuck with us again. mr. donavan buys us all the apple dumplings we can eat. it ain't like it's really stealin'. it's our gold, and we're givin' it to ya. all you have to do is pick it up. we'll help you. pardon me just a minute, ma'am. what do you think, theodore? oh, i don't know about the hash knife throwin' in with a bunch of kids. how's that gonna look in the history books? we wouldn't have to call it
"hash knife." we could call them the apple dumpling gang. who's gonna know the difference? it's like the kid says.
- it ain't actually stealin'.
- and you better hurry...
'cause we're leavin' at 4:00, when the bank closes. theodore? all right. all right! come on. now, here's the bank. now we're gonna need some dynamite to blow the safe. we gotta get some kind of a wagon to haul off the gold. you got that, gang? now i think we'll go in the side door. you remember that side door. yeah. now when we were hangin' in there-- let's see-- that would be just off to the right. you told me to get you a wagon, didn't ya? not that wagon. well, what's wrong with-- look. these are the fastest horses in town. we'll be halfway to mexico before they find out. it's too late to change now. let's get the thing headed in the other direction. right. you kids keep a lookout for the sheriff. i'm sorry. we're closed. eh? i say we're-- i'm sorry, reverend. we're closed for the day. you'll-- open that safe. clovis! somebody else is already robbing the bank. come on! oh, no. get on in there. hurry up! where'd they come from? they was outside lookin' in. get 'em over yonder out of the way. and you keep quiet. you hear? ox, keep an eye on 'em. get out of the room. ain't that the most beautiful sight you ever saw?

'cause i shot you in the leg, are you, frank? i guess you are. please, gentlemen, no shooting. that dynamite is old and is sweating.

Emergency snow alert is now in effect.
No automobiles are to be driven without snow tires or chains.
Winds up to 45 miles per hour...
That was a great dinner, Emma.
- That baby!
- You're a grandpa!
- Our daughter's fine.
- Mmm.
But Dorothy.
Give her time, honey.
Give her time.
Those dishes ain't gonna wash themselves.
Mrs. Warren's son looks real fine, don't he?
Aunt Em, please, no more matchmaking.
Did you make the decision about that new school yet?
It's no decision to make.
But, honey, it's a chance to teach in high school.
Get away from that kindergarten once and for all. It's more money.
But besides the money, it's a chance for you to be with older students.
Almost adults.
- I like it with the kids, Aunt Em.
- I know you do, honey.
And you're a fine teacher.
But that's why I think you'd enjoy teachin' high school.
Have a chance to be with the students for four years...
...such an important time in their development.
I'm really happy with the kids, Aunt Em.
But you been there for three years already.
It's time you got out of that sandbox and into some new people, new neighborhood.
Girl, do you know you're
24 years old and you've...
Never been south of 125th Street?
Well, you haven't.
Oh, here we go again.
You get me so worked up...
...that I'm beginning to sound like a Jewish mother.
I can't see how goin' south of 125th
Street ever made anybody's life better.
And you're never gonna know unless you try, are you?
Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that.
Why don't you go in and relax?
I can do... Let me do that.
Listen, I know gettin' out in that world ain't easy...
...leaving Uncle Henry and me.
But we'll always be here for ya, Dorothy.
And whatever your fears are, well...
...they'll be defeated just by facing up to 'em.
Now, you take that new job and find a place for you and Toto.
It's time for you to make a home of your own.
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Toto!
# La, la, la, la, la #
# La, la, la, la #
Toto! Where are you?
Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto!
Oh!
Toto, Toto.
- Toto, Toto.
- To... To... Toto!
- Toto, Toto. Toto, Toto.
- To... To... To...
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!
God, where am I?
Toto! Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
No! No!
- Relax, Mama!
- We just wanna lay a little thanks on ya.
- What?
- You know, heavy on the gratitude department.
- Gratitude? For what?
- For curling the curse.
- For leveling the leech.
- For killing our oppressor.
Uh! I never killed nothin' in my life.
- Never killed the point?
- A pint?
- A good story?
- The umpire?
- No!
- Never killed no time?
No, I told you!
I never killed nothin'!
Well, then, I think you graduated...
...from the bush leagues into the majors, girl.
Toto?
Can you dig this?
- Who is it?
- Ain't no more "is"!
Thanks to you, it's a "was"!
- She was Evermean.
- The Wicked Witch from the East.
And they didn't call her Evermean for nothin'!
She was the parks department commissioner!
Caught us paintin' on her playground walls.
- Turned us into graffiti!
- And there we stayed.
- Flat, splat and stuck like that!
- Doomed as cartoons forever.
'Til you burned alphabet through the sky and ended the curse.
- And the "curseress. "
- Givin' a new lease on life to us...
The Munchkins, most recently referred to as the "cursees. "
Toto.
Let's hear it for
Super Witch and her Wonder Dog!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Miss One!
Come to Mama, you hot little digits!
Let me lay my 20-20s on ya!
Oh, how I love you!
Let me... Mmm!
Count the ways!
Oh, mmm! Mmm!
Innumerable blessings, countless felicitations.
Thank you beyond number and additional good stuff!
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to kill her.
Oh, don't be all sixes and sevens, honey.
You did the world a multitudinous service by 86ing ol' Evermean.
Bottom line, honey, this chick put the "ugh" in ugly.
But she sure had pretty shoes, didn't she? Yah!
I don't want these shoes.
I wanna go home.
I wouldn't discount those shoes, honey.
And don't ever take 'em off until you do get home.
Remember Miss One told ya.
Oh, pardon me.
Miss One's the name if you haven't guessed by now.
Numbers is my game and now that you've freed us... we can all go back to runnin' our business, ahem.
We can all go back to runnin' our business.
But where am I?
Where am I?
You're in Munchkin Land!
- The indivisible Land of Oz!
- Oz?
But where's my home?
Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York?
- New York?
- 433 Prospect Place.
Ooh! Four, three, three.
You wanna play more than one number today, honey?
I got a freedom special, three numbers for the price...
No, I don't wanna play any numbers.
I just wanna get home!
Oh, well, now that ol'
Evermean's number's up...
...that leaves only three witches in Oz.
One, myself, but my powers don't amount to much.
And number two, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South.
Oh, she's a real star, but you can hardly catch her in.
And number three, the multi-horrored
Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West.
Evermean's even uglier sister!
But I don't think it'd be a good time to ask her for a favor.
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz could cipher how to get you back to...
- Where'd you say that place was?
- The Wiz?
What's a Wiz?
What's a... What's a Wiz?
Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate.
The "X" quotient, the new math.
The common denominator, the main man.
The head honcho!
Bottom line, honey.
Numero uno!
- Where is he? How do I find him?
- Catch this number, honey.

Count your blessings, cut your losses and follow the Yellow Brick Road.
- The Yellow Brick Road?
Yeah! The Yellow Brick Road!
Yellow Brick. Toto!
Remember, don't ever take those shoes off and watch out for the poison poppies!
Wait.
Miss One?
Miss One?
Miss One!

Wait! Mister, please wait!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Succulent and divine!
- Delicious and nutritious.
- Brother crows, this is good stuff!
I'm glad you fellows are enjoying your breakfast.
Is today the day you're gonna help me get down from here?
Help you down?
What is goin' down in that hayloft you call a head?
Didn't we tell you yesterday and the day before that...
- And the day before that...
- That you can't get down?
This is your life, buddy, all hung up!
Besides, Clyde...
...us crows are just thinkin' of you.
There ain't nothin' to get down for!
But I was just thinkin', just once, fellas...
...for a little while to walk in my garden, wouldn't that be terrific?
- Walk!
- You can't walk!
Why, you just a straw paper dummy!
You're right, fellas.
I was just bein' selfish.
And stupid as usual!
- But I was readin' this morning that most people...
- Oh, man!
Look, didn't we tell you readin' was a waste of time?
- But Bacon here said...
- Bacon? Once over lightly, please!
"Knowledge is power. "
- See, and, uh, Cicero, he said...
- Cicero-ro-row!
"More men are ennobled by study than by nature. "
And over here, especially apropos in my situation...
...i. E., stuck up on this here pole:
"Do not accept any situation.
Question, argue and explore. "
Now who you gonna believe?
- Mr. Nobody on that paper?
- Fellas, please!
Or your good friends, the crows?
Yeah, who have dedicated their lives to educatin' you.
- Yeah!
- Sounds to me, fellas...
...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot the crow commandments again.
Fellas, I did not forget the crow commandments. Please!
Run 'em by me!
Run 'em by me.
- Thou shalt honor all crows.
- Right on!
- Proceed!
- Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature.
- Trash! Trash!
- And the most important one!
Thou shalt never, never get down off of this here pole!
You got it, Clyde!
And the crow anthem!
I gotta sing that thing again?
# You gotta libretti it
'til you get it #
- # Elucidate #
- # Reiterate #
# And syncopate #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# People keep sayin' #
# Things are gonna change but they look just like #
# They're stayin' the same #
# You get in way over your head #
# And you only got yourself to blame #
- # You can't win, child #
- # You can't win, child #
# You can't break even #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
The world keeps movin' #
# And you're standin' far behind #
# People keep sayin' #
- # Things'll get better #
- # Just to ease your state of mind #
# So you lean back #
# And you smoke that smoke #
# And you drink your glass of wine #
# Sayin' you can't win child #
# You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't win #
# You can't win no way if your story stays the same #
- # You ain't winnin' #
- # Oh, no #
# But I'd like to see you
I'm awfully glad you came #
# Better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin' #
# Then the world has got no shame #
# You can't win, child #
# Can't break even
Can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# Ain't the way it's supposed to be #
- # You'll be spendin' your little bit of money #
- # Oh, no #
# While someone else rides for free #
- # Learned your lesson #
- Ooh!
# Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame #
- # And you can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
# You can't win, child
Can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't get out #
Ooh!
# Of the game #
# No, no, no ##
- I'll, I'll help you down.
- What?
You will?
What's she doing here?
- Get her outta here.
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo, shoo, go on about your business.
Shoo!
Ooh!
- Just hold on.
- This is just an experiment.
The results of the first experiment:
Subject is a hopeless failure.
- You are not.
- I am.
You're just a product of some negative thinking.
First thing we have to do is get rid of these crows.
Come on, Toto, sic 'em!
Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo! Before I call the taxidermist, you turkeys!
Get off me, dog!
Good boy, Toto.
We can go now.
You okay?
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!
I think I'm gonna make it this time.
You sure are.
Just a little self-confidence...
...and coordination.
You're gonna be fine.
You mean, all this time the only thing standing between...
...hangin' up there and livin' it up down here... were those crows?
Well, they told you you couldn't do it and you believed them.
If I only had a brain, I would have figured that out a long time ago.
There you go with that negative thinkin' again.
- Everybody has a brain.
- Uh-uh.
Not me, look.
Oh.
Garbage?
"Lgnorance is the night of the mind...
...a night without moon or star. "
Confucius said that.
I'm on my way to find the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home.
That's nice. Thank you.
Good luck.
I thought maybe he could get you a brain.
You think that he could...
And Toto and me, we could sure use some company.
Besides, you have nothin' to lose.
I don't, do I?
That was so smart of you!
I wish I thought of that.
Indications are it would be very advantageous for me to join you.
Good.
Um, we only have one problem.
The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick
Road, but I haven't been able to find it.
- Yellow Brick Road?
- There it is!
Hey, wait! Wait!
Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"?
- Yes!
- Look over here!
We don't need no cabs.
- Say, what's your name?
- My name is... Dorothy.
Dorothy and Toto?
What intelligent names!
Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have to find our own Yellow Brick Road.
# Ease on down
Ease on dow... #
- Down the road!
- There it is!
# Ease on down #
- Oh!
- # Ease on... Down #
- Down the road!
- Oh!
# Don't you carry nothin' #
- # That might be a load #
- There it is!
Dorothy! Look! Dorothy!
Aaah!
Ta-da!
Whoo! Come on, Dorothy!
Come on!
Whoo!
# Come on and ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Don't you carry nothin' that might be a load #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Pick your left foot up put your right one down #
# Come on, legs keep movin' #
# Don't you lose no ground #
# Just you keep on keepin' on the road you choose #
# Don't you give up on walkin'
'cause you gave up shoes #
# Ease on down
Ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #

# Ease on down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Ease on down
Ease on down #
Toto!
# Ease on down ease, ease on down #
- # Down the road ##
- Help!
Help!
Help?
Help? Where?
Help! Help!
Over here!
Help!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Where are you?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Step right up and save a life!
Ooh! Ooh!
I'm in a little bit of a squeeze, brother. Can you give me a hand?
Dorothy?
Oh, how terrible.
- Don't move.
- Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades.
We'll be right back.
Oh, he's so brave.
He's probably in shock.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be in shock... Just once.
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
No apology necessary. I told you nothing hurts me. I have no feelings.
The genius who created me only took care of my dashing good looks...
...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible attraction to the wrong women.
What he forgot to add... was a heart.
But... Everyone has a heart.
Alas, everyone but yours truly.
Hello!
Nobody home in Soulville.
Rid of you!
Free from your posterior prison!
You hulking she devil!
Don't hear ya laughing now.
We were abandoned here when this park went "el foldo. "
Ah, it was a sad day.
There's not much amusement to the closing down of an amusement park.
But yours truly is an old trooper!
I quickly made plans for the future.
But alas, I was felled by my 4th wife, Teenie.
Crushed in my prime!
There, how does that feel?
But that's the whole tragic point, my friends.
# What would I do #
# If I could suddenly feel #
# And to know once again #
# That what I feel is real #
# I could cry
I could smile #
# I might lay back for a while #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
# If I could feel #
# What would I do #
# If I could reach inside of me #
# And to know how it feels to say #
# I like what I see #
# And I'd be more #

I could spend #
# Just being vulnerable again #

I'm just a miserable hunk of junk.
Me!
Once the fastest metal mouth on the midway.
Frozen... ironically in a position
I had assumed all too often.
A seat cushion for Teenie!
Teenie!
- Teenie!
- Dorothy!
- Teenie! Teenie!
- Are you thinkin' what I am?
- Teenie!
- You're so smart!
Teenie! Teen...
You could come with us to see the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home...
...and he's gonna get the Scarecrow some brains.
Maybe he could get you a heart.
You're not just flimflammin' an ol' flimflammer, are ya?
Could I come with ya?
- Of course.
- "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. "
What's wrong?
He rusted himself cryin'.
Oil! Oil!
- What?
- Oil!
- Find some oil!
- Some oil!
Oil!
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it trickle down my spine #
# If you don't have STP #
# Crisco will do just fine #
# Slide some to my elbow #
# And to my fingers if you would #
# Slide some oil to me, girl #
# Whoo, don't that feel good #
# Slide some oil to my feet #
# Look-a there
I got toes again #
# Come on slide some oil to my knees #
# And let me see if I can bend #
# Slide some oil to me #
# I'm beginnin' to feel just fine #
# Slide some oil down my throat #
# And let me lubricate my mind #
# Slide some oil to me #
# Go ahead hit my shoulder blades #
# Those who don't have to lubricate #
# Sure got it made #
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it slip down my side.
# Laying there in one position #
# Sure done made me tired #
Now watch me dance.
Come on, you metal metatarsals, don't fail me now.
Ah-ha! Fall in line and get left behind.
Two bits!
Let me show you my
Saturday night finish!
Oh! Music man!
Let me hear that band!
# Don't turn the water on me #
# Just let me burn and let me lubricate #

Come on!
# There may be times you think you've lost your mind #

Hey! Look at me walkin'!
- Stop the music!
- What's the matter? You need more oil?
No! That beast!
He's checkin' us out.
Oh, it's just a statue.
Made of stone, see?
Now even a dummy like me knows a stone lion...
...can't... Check you out.
# Say what you wanna but I'm here to stay #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# Now you can go where you're gonna #
# But don't get in my way
I'm a mean ol' lion #
# You'll be standing in a draft #
# If you don't hear me laugh #
Ha-ha!
# If you have to come around #
# You best not make me frown #
# Or I just might knock you down #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# You know I'm ready to fight and turn your day into night #

# Now I'm a mean ol' lion ##
How dare you touch...
...the personage of a king?
You tacky package of horse fodder.
Begone, you overexcited slot machine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! You mangy mutt! Oh!
Toto!
Oh!
He bit my paw!
King of the jungle?
- King of the cowards.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself, scaring us like that.
You big scaredy-cat!
I can't scare anything.
I can't even scare a scarecrow...
...a tin man or a little puppy, anything.
It's no wonder they drummed me out of the jungle.
- I.O.B.K.!
- I.O.B.K.?
Incapable Of Being King!
No! Wait, wait! Wait!
I was exiled in disgrace.
I thought I'd be safe here.
No one would... discover my terrible secret.
Uh, that I'm...
...a lion without any courage!
"Uneasy lies the head...
...that wears a crown. "
W. Shakespeare.
Well, I thought
I'd seen 'em all.
But never, never have I seen...
...a lion... without courage.
Lion!
Lion!
Maybe the Wiz could give you some courage.
- It's a good idea.
- Capital suggestion.
- Capital! He's gonna get me a heart.
- And me some brains.
Come with us to Emerald City.
I'd love to, but I can't.
But why?
Because... I'm scared!
Oh.
# Oh, there #
# May be times #
# When you wish you wasn't born #
# And you wake one morning to find your courage gone #
# But just know that feelin' only lasts a little while #
# You just stick with us
We'll show you how to smile #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #

Ah, my ma would be so proud.
Going to see the Wiz!
My mama used to always say to me, Fleet!
Fleet?
That's my name,
Fleetwood Coup de Ville.
- Mama had high ideals.
- Yeah!
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah!
I ain't too happy underground, you all.
- How does he do that?
- It's just a hoax, my friend.
He's got a little motor in his... Pocket.
- Lion! Lion!
- Help!
- Oh, my... Please, somebody!
- Shh!
Lion! Lion!
Owww! Lion!
Li...
Lion!
Aaah!
Lion, save me!
Dorothy!
Toto! Toto, Toto, Toto.
Hey!
Oh! Wait!
- Where's the lion?
- I'm coming!
- Wait, wait!
- Lion!
Come on! Let's go!
- Hurry up!
- This way, this way! Wait for me!
Hey!
Sssss!
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
My queen, if you'll allow me, like I say...
...you stick with the big kitty and you'll be in heaven.
Sssss!
Outta the frying pan, into the...
This is like a setup.
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!
Don't follow them! Don't!
Oh, please! It's a setup!
- Stop!
- Come back!
Jump! Don't go in there!
Whoo, whoo!
Oh! Dorothy! Lion!
- I can't move him! I can't move him!
- Dorothy?
- Get Toto, we'll come back for him.
- Toto!
Oh, look, poor little Toto!
Sweet little Toto.
What are we going to do?
- All is lost!
- Dorothy!
Dorothy, please.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, all is lost.
# How high the moon #
What's happenin', babe?
Hey, Lion's okay!
- Hey, baby!
- Come and cry over here!
- Teenie! Think of Teenie!
- Dor... Dorothy?
- Think of Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie, uh, Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie!
- It's all my fault!
Uh, Teenie! Uh, Teenie!
Oh, mighty Zeus!
And gods of the universe!
Why have you cursed this low, mangy animal so?
Once I was a king, a lion amongst lions!
Ruler of a beautiful kingdom by a waterfall.
Attended by butterflies and sparrows.
And now banished for lack of courage...
I cannot even protect these friends who have been so kind.
Oh, I was strong and brave...
...in the subway only to be foolish and weak again.
I led us into the very jaws of death!
Oh, let me end it all!
- Lion, Lion!
- No!
No, let me splatter to the four winds!
It's all right, Lion.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
- The worst is over, my furry friend.
- No!
Would you lay an appropriate quote on this poor beasty brother?
"Showers expected late tomorrow. "
Lion?
# There is a place #
# We'll go #
# Where there is mostly quiet #
# Flowers and butterflies #
# A rainbow lives beside it #
# And from a velvet sky #
# The summer storm #
# You can feel #
# The coolness in the air #
# But you're still #
# Warm #
# And then a mighty roar #
# Will start the sky #
# To cryin' #
# But not even lightning #
# Will be frightening #
# My lion #
# And with no fear inside #
# No need to run #
# No need to hide #
# You're standing strong #
# And tall #
# You're the bravest #
# Of them all #
# If on courage #
# You must call #
# Then just keep on tryin' #
# And tryin' #
# You're a lion #
# In your own way #
# Be a lion #
Come on, be a lion.
# I'm standing strong #

- How do we get in?
- And how do you do?
- Good evening there, brother.
- This place is nice.
The service entrance is at the side.
We're here to see the Wiz.
This is where the Wiz lives, isn't it?
May I welcome you to the Emerald City.
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# I want to be seen green #
# Wouldn't be caught dead red #
# 'Cause if you are seen green #
# It means you've got mean bread #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen in green to show that your stuff's laid #
- # If you're not seen green #
# You'd better be wearin' jade #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen green #
# Don't tell him your cupboard's bare #
# That you gave up one week's feed #
# To pay for your colored hair #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Oz.
I thought it over and green is dead.
'Til I change my mind, the color's red.
# I wouldn't be seen green #
# Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ah, ah #
# I wouldn't be caught dead #
# And if I'm caught at all #
# Then catch me in dead red #
# Ooo #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to be real hot #
# So throw away those green gems #
# And wear rubies on your yacht #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to have flash and flair #
# And if you're not seen red #
# Then you shouldn't be seen #
# Nowhere #
How quick fashion goes down the drain.
Last week when you all was wearin' pink...
...already for me, red was old.
The ultimate yellow brick is gold.
That's the new color, children, hit it.
# Golden gold #
# You've got to be seen gold #
# Watch out for the new kind you've got to have old gold #
# Like some from a gold mine
You've got to be wearin' gold #
# The 24 karat kind and once you've shined it up #
# It should ought to make you blind #
# You've got to be seen in gold to show you're super slick #
# It helps to pay tips and tolls
It's the ultimate yellow brick #
# It's the ultimate #
# Gold #
# Gold, gold #
# Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold ##
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Send up the one with the silver slippers.
Do you know how lucky you are?
I've been trying to get an appointment for two years!
No one sees the Wiz!
- I knew you'd make it.
- Who does your hair?
Can you come for dinner next Wednesday?
- Can I give you my card?
- Can I take you home?
And...
Only the one with the silver slippers!
You go ahead, Dorothy.
"He who hesitates... "
Etcetera, etcetera.
Uh, I'd like to speak to the Wiz.
Hey, Mike!
Excuse me...
Excuse me, sir, Mr. Wiz?
Speak!
I'm not alone, sir. I'm here with my three companions and my dog, Toto.
Forget it.
No riffraff.
Uh, they're not riffraff, sir.
They're my friends and they've traveled far to see you.
I said, forget it!
Then, then, I'm not comin' up there.
What?
Either you see my friends, sir, or you forget it.
Send up the riffraff.
I don't think there's any choice.
Dorothy, you don't have to do it!
We could stay right here!
The Emerald City's not a bad place.
Get a small apartment, chip in together.
Hey, I bet in no time we'd fit right in.
But I could never be happy here.
Besides, I'd... Never get home.
I have to go all the way, even if it means to Evillene.
Come on, Toto, good boy.
Then I'm going with you.
Likewise!
Me too.
Come on.
Which road do we take?
Road? This one...
...and you may be sorry.
- Then how do we find Evillene?
- Don't worry.
She'll find you.
Owww!

Work! Work! Work! Work!
Work, work, work, work!
And...
...all lunch hours are cancelled!
Oh, please, O beautiful one!
We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!
Well, suffering is food for the soul.
Now suffer!
So, no one stopped Dorothy, eh?
All right!
Amateur night is over!
I'm summoning my flying monkeys!
No, no, not the flying monkeys!
Yes, yes, the flying monkeys!
I hate to have to do this myself, because I can't stand the smells...
...but these are red alert conditions!
Hot... Fire.
Peee-uu! Aaah!
- What's happenin'?
- Don't come any closer!
I got a little job for you, Cheetah.
Bring me Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Lion and the dog too.
How do you want 'em?
White bread or rye?
You get smart with me and I'll send you back to your cages!
Now get Dorothy and don't damage those silver slippers!
Peee-uu!
War is hell!
Hit it, Morris!
# Don't nobody bring me
Don't nobody bring me #
# Don't nobody bring me no bad news ##
# Ease on down #
I ain't scared.
Aaah!
- Hey, brother!
- Not now!
Lion! Wait for me!
Get back, I told you!
Psst! Psst! Psst!
Psst!
Psst, psst, psst!
We're over here!
- Psst! Lion!
- Psst!
Hey, brother!
You better get outta the way for me!
Toto! Where's Toto?
Toto! Oh!
Toto!
- Toto! Toto!
- Hey, there he is.
- Toto.
- I think we're safe.
So, you're Dorothy, huh?
You murdered my sister!
A saint she was.
And stole her shoes!
- Give them to me!
- No.
- What?
- No!
All right, you!
Don't worry, Dorothy.
It doesn't hurt.
It's just a little rough on my filing system.
Never fear, my little flower.
I'm just a hollow shell!
Don't give up the shoes!
Would you like sauerkraut or mustard, my dear?
On your hot dog!
Toto! Toto! No! Don't!
No, don't!
Don't you dare! Toto, Toto!
- Will you give me those shoes?
- Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I thought.
Toto.
Psst! Psst!
Hurry up with those shoes!
No! Don't touch that! No!
- No! No!
- Toto!
I'm allergic to water!
It makes me melt! No! No!
Please, please, help me with my friends!
Oh, no!
Here it is, I got 'em!
Oh, put him together.
I don't care what you do.
Just put him down.
Put him together.
Where's his arm?
His arm, oh!
Okay, okay, do something!
Get some tools, get something!
A crowbar, a hammer!
Don't hurt him!
# Everybody look around 'cause there's a reason to rejoice, you see #

Whee!
Hello?
- Where are we?
- This must be the back door.
I don't think the killers of the Wicked Witch of the West...
...should be using the back door.
You know what I mean?
Cheetah says it's a shortcut.
- Good-bye, Cheetah.
- Good-bye, Dorothy.
Bye. Whew!
It's open.
Hello? Hello in there!
Wait!
- Wait a minute.
- Does this look familiar?
Guess who got had?
Barnum said there's a sucker born every minute.
I was there when he said it...
...but I never thought
I'd be one of 'em.
Phony!
You're nothing but a phony!
The Wizard's out!
He's not here!
Lies! No more lies.
You charlatan!
I've seen men shot for less.
- You're a terrible man!
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Phony!
Everything they say about me is true.
I'm a phony!
I got no right to be pretending to be the Wiz!
I've got nothin'.
Hocus-pocus.
I'm just plain old Herman Smith from Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
Atlantic City?
You mean, you're from New Jersey?
Mm-hmm.
I'm just a second-rate politician from District Seven.
"Public office is the last refuge of the incompetent. " Penrose!
Incompetent?
Ha-ha-ha!
That's me.
I'm incompetent.
So much so, I could never get elected to public office.
Not because I didn't try.
I tried everything.
Look, look!
I ran for everything.
Alderman, councilman, assembly leader!
I became a laughingstock.
I couldn't even get on the ticket!
Finally, in desperation,
I ran for dogcatcher!
I like animals.
Don't get me wrong.
I was at the end of my rope.
I plunged myself into the campaign.
One desperate grandstand play.
You know what I did?
I rented a hot-air balloon!
Hot air!
That's a perfect vehicle for you.
No, no, no!
It was a beautiful
Fourth of July day!
I planned to fly over the boardwalk and the beach...
...and throw my...
Aaah!
Throw my leaflets to the astonished crowds below.
My motto was...
"Vote for Smith, your best bet to catch that pet. "
But just when I got up in the balloon...
A terrible storm came up...
...and blew me into the clouds.
I got lost.
I landed here in Oz.
They'd never seen a hot-air balloon like mine before.
And I know I should have told them the truth...
...but they proclaimed me the Wizard...
...and I needed the job.
And you mean...
...you sent us to kill Evillene...
...knowing... we might never come back?
She would've killed me.
She would've found out
I had no power, and took over Oz.
That's no excuse.
Come on.
Please, please don't go.
I live...
I live here all alone...
...in terror...
...that someone will find out...
...that I'm a fraud.
Please...
...just stay with me for a little while and talk.
You can talk to me crazy...
...call me names.
What's the matter?
Now I'll never get my brain.
Nor my heart.
Or my courage.
But you don't need them now...
...because you've had them all along.
Scarecrow. Scarecrow?
You're the one who figured out how to find the Yellow Brick Road...
...and how to destroy Evillene...
...and every smart move we've made.
Didn't you?
And, Lion...
...you wouldn't even give up when
Evillene strung you up by your tail.
And, Tin Man...
...you have more heart than anyone I've ever known.
Honest?
Yes.
You never needed anything from the fake Wizard anyway.

What about you, Dorothy?
You'll never get home.
Me?
I guess you're stuck with Toto and me.
It's Glinda, the Good Witch of the South!
She has great powers.
Hello, Dorothy.
Please, is there a way for me to get home?
Dorothy, you were wise and good enough...
...to help your friends find what was inside them all the time.
That's true for you, also.
Home?
Inside me?
I don't understand.
Home is a place we all must find, child.
It's not just a place where you eat or sleep.
Home is knowing.
Knowing your mind, knowing your heart...
...knowing your courage.
If we know ourselves, we're always home, anywhere.
# If you believe #

You mean,
I could have gone home...
...by clicking my heels three times?
Uh-huh.
Dorothy.
Can you do something for me?
They've had what they've been searching for in them all along.
I don't know what's in you.
You'll have to find that out for yourself.
But I do know one thing.
You'll never find it in the safety of this room.
I tried that all my life.
It doesn't work.
There's a whole world out there.
And you'll have to begin...
...by letting people see who you really are.
Success...
...fame and fortune...
...they're all illusions.
All there is that is real...
...is the friendship...
...that two can share.
That's beautiful.
Who said that?
I did.
Oh, Dorothy.
I'll think of you all the time.
And I will miss you...
...every day.
Even if I had to go back to that junk pile...
...even as Teenie's seat cushion,
I wouldn't mind...
...because I have known real love.
Oh, don't rust yourself, now.
Oh, Dorothy.
If it hadn't been for you...
I'd still be back on that pedestal...
...afraid to live.
Me, too.
Thank you.
Thank you for being my friends.
I'm ready now.
Think of home.
Home.
# When I think of home #
# I think of a place #
# Where there's love overflowin' #
# I wish I was home #
# I wish I was back there #
# With the things
I've been knowin' #
# Wind that makes the tall trees #
# Bend into leaning #
# Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning #
# Sprinkling the scene #
# Makes it all clean #
# Maybe there's a chance for me to go back #
# Now that I have some direction #
# It would sure be nice to be back home #
# Where there's love and affection #
# And just maybe I can convince time to slow up #
# Givin' me enough time in my life to grow up #
# Time, be my friend #
# Let me start again #
# Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face #
# But I still know where I'm goin' #
# I have had my mind spun around in space #
# And yet I've watched it growin' #
# And if you're listenin', God #
# Please don't make it hard #
# To know if we should believe the things that we see #
# Tell us should we run away #
# Should we try and stay #
# Or would it be better just to let things be #
# Livin' here in this brand-new world #
# Might be a fantasy #
# But it taught me to love #
# So it's real real to me #
# And I've learned #
# That we must look inside our hearts #
# To find #
# A world full of love #

LAST SUNDAY I MADE A KILLING.
A GUY WANTED TO WALLPAPER

MARCH IN ITALIAN]
[ENDS]
In the year 50 B. C. all Gaul, now known as
France, was covered with impenetrable forest... where calm peace and quite reigned supreme, only the birds...
Hey wait a moment! Wait a moment! I said the year 50 B. C!
In the year 50 B. C. all Gaul was covered with impenetrable forests, where calm peace and quite reigned supreme.
Julius Caesar after much fierce fighting had succeeded in conquering Gaul... intending to set the seal of Romans civilisation on his latest conquest.
Yes, all Gaul, now known as
France, was occupied by the Romans.
Well no not quiet, somewhere in
Armorica, a little village was... holding out against the invaders. A little village surrounded by Romans.
The brave people of this village.
Do I really need to introduce them?
Hands up in the house who hasn't met them yet.
Ah, I see all right! I'll make the introductions.
This big hut is the home of the undisputed chief of the village.
The formidable Vitalstatistix.
Darling, please darling, it's me ought to be up on that shield!
I'm the chief after all!
I've got to go out shopping, you can have your shield back later, meanwhile... you tidy the place up a bit, it's like a wild boars sty! Come on you two!
This is Cacofonix, the village bard, people don't always appreciate... his talents, sometimes express their feelings in a tactful delicate way.
Ah here comes Dogmatix, the village mascot and a great friend of Obelix.
He help him delivering menhirs.
Dogmatix, come here Dogmatix, I'm teaching him to retrieve menhirs Asterix... he could be a big help in my work.
You know Obelix it isn't that I don't think that dog's very intelligent... but I do sometimes wonder if he isn't a rather small to carry menhirs.
The voice of reason you have just heard belongs to the renowned Asterix!
The best warrior in the village! The famous Asterix whose adventures are... on sale in all the best bookshops and had been translated into every language.
Salute! Guten tag! Hello! Hi!
Konnichiwa! Buenas dia! Salam!
Bonjour!
But you may ask yourself how did this little village with its handful... of warriors manage to hold out against the all powerful Roman invaders?
Well that was thanks to the magic potion brewed up by the Druid Getafix... which gave superhuman strength to those who were lucky enough to get it.
Oh no Obelix! No! The potion has had a permanent effect on you!
You know you fell into the
Cauldron when you were a baby.
...fell into the Cauldron when you were a baby...nhanhanhay...
Oh some Romans!
Centurion, what is the point of having another go, you know what those...
Gauls will do to us. That lot is simply not human.
Maybe but those are Caesar's orders, who knows perhaps it will be... different this time. Watch there!
Form square!
Forward!
Join the army they said, it's a real man's life they said.
It didn't turn out so very different form usual did it Centurion?
No, no not very. -I know rather a good joke... post equitem sedet atra cura.
Right these Gauls will make
Latin a dead language... if Julius Caesar would insist on fighting them.
Those Gauls are simply not human
Centurion, they just are not human.
You're right, they not human, ordinary mortals could not resist... the might of the Roman army.
- I told you so.
Must be Gods, we haven't a hope to beat the Gods!
I'm going to Rome to tell
Caesar, the Gods are against us!
They're Gods, you say? This crazy
Gaulish village are Gods, that's a laugh!
But Caesar you do have to admit these Gaulish villages can keep... your army at bay. In my opinion it is time we come to adopt a... realistic approach to the situation.
Gods are against us, we're done for.
While seeking to follow a constructive line, I hope none the less to be quite... objective and I have therefore come to the following conclusion... it is no good trying to fight Gods.
Let us suppose to look on the bright side, we've only got to deal with... demi gods. Well even so, it is still an extremely unpleasant predicament.
To take an example that can be anyone willing to take on Hercules?
Hercules? Gods or Demigods! I
Caesar will show you cowardly... old counsellors that half-wits are only mortal, very mortal. Bruto!
Stop playing about that knife, you'll end up hurting somebody.
But how are you going to show us that those
Gauls aren't Gods after all, oh Caesar?
Well first I shall visit them myself and I shall put them to certain tests... which only the Gods could perform.
And if they really are
Gods then I should give in.
But if they are just men, ordinary human being, they'll have to face the anger of Caesar!
And by Jupiter I can tell you they'll finish up inside the lions of the circus!
Get that chariot and let us got ready!
I think I heard a bell going darling, will you go and see who is there?
Julius Caesar is outside and wants to see you.
Julius Caesar, the
Julius Caesar? Himself.
Right, a towel for my feet, fetch my shoes. Let everyone know Asterix!
Where are those shoe pairs gone to?
Yes I'm coming!
Leave them to me, leave them to me.
- Calm down, let the chief have a word.
Ave, village chief!
- Hail Caesar, what are you doing here?
I have come to make a suggestion.
Your defiance of me is bad for my reputation!
In Rome they're starting to laugh at me.
They are saying a bunch of half wits... can hold the Roman army at bay.
- Really, watch your language you...
But some people say you must be Gods.
Gods?
- Us Gods?
Yes Gods and if that is so then I will admit defeat.
But if you are only men... then you will have to give in into my power and accept our laws.
And how are me and my friends supposed to prove if we are really Gods?
I wonder if you have heard of Hercules?
- Hercules the grocer?
No, no, the God Hercules! He performed
12 difficult task with goddessment meet it to olimpus
It's seen the god saw that he must be one of them
These 12 tasks what were they?
He strangled the Nemean Lion, killed the
Lernian Hydra. Caught the Elymanthian... boar alive. Hunted down the stag
Cerynean, shot the Stymphalian... birds with his bow. Tamed the bull on the Island of Crete, Killed Diomedes... conquered the Amazons, cleaned the
Augean stables in a day, killed Geryon... stole the golden apples of the
Hesperides set Theseus free from Haydees.
And you want us to do all these daft things to show weather or not we're God?
No not exactly that's all a bit out of date now, I set up a new set of tasks.
Only Gods could hope to perform all of them and if you succeed I blow... myself fairly deep but if you fail in even one then you will have to give in. It's a Deal?
You bet your life it's a deal.
- Yes yes!
Right, These tasks will take you to Rome, Caius Pocus!
He will act as your guide along the way and see that the tasks are fairly... performed. He's the most trustworthy man and very honest.
So, if you should succeed, Rome will surrender, if you fail in a single task... then you will all become slaves of Rome.
Okay we'll have it done.
- Ave!
You really think Caesar would surrender and let you become masters of Rome?
Come to think of it perhaps we got a bit carried away.
Oh, your magic potion will help us out Druid.
Sure we'll have lots of fun by Tutatis!
Lots of fun!
- Asterix is the cleverest man among us.
Obelix is the strongest, so you two are the only ones who can succeed.
May Tutatis hear you.
Here is a gourd full of magic potion, mind you use it well.
You're going to need it!
Well then, are we on?
- We're off.
It's funny I wonder why Cacofonix hasn't shown up to sing us a farewell song.
Hi, now for the first task, follow me, will you please?
This is Aspestos just back from Marathon, he was champion runner at the Olympic Games...
He can run faster than a horse, faster than the stone wind that howls through the trees.
One of you will have to beat him in a race.
You'll do it Asterix!
You're faster than me, faster than a horse wind howling through the trees.
All right. We'll be waiting for you on the other side of the forest.
At the finishing line. Start when all the sand has run out of the hour glass.
Well fancy that, you are a real Olympic champion, that's very interesting.
We have athletics in the village too, but obviously as we all get some... of the magic potion it is not very exciting.
Are you listening to me? Right I was saying it's not very interesting because... we all get there at once and we have to draw lots with the winner.
You notice that I don't need to drink any magic potion because I'm very fast.
I say, you are not very chatty are you?
Hey wait for me!
I think I'd better take a little potion the village's future is at stake.
Hey there, not a bad start, you really took me by surprise!
I got a held up back there in the forest because I stopped to pick mushrooms.
You see? I like picking flowers too.
Look aren't they beautiful?
If you like apples I know a good place over there where there is a good tree.
Funny, the race has improved his profile.
That seems to be the first of your tasks performed quite successfully.
So now for the next one.
Kermes the Persian, the most amazing javelin thrower the world has ever seen.
His javelin has crossed oceans and seas, this is your second task.
Throw javelin further than Kermes.
War! This means war!
Now this time Asterix, let me!
All right! But throw it as far as you can.
Just you watch!
Second task performed, and now for the next one.
You are going to play
Silindric the German.
No wrestler or gladiator has ever beaten him.
Silindric the German'll come in that way, you must wait for him here.
Look at the size of those gates, he must be big Silindric the German.
Yes I like them big and strong.
That's him! Silindric the German?
- Why he isn't big at all!
I like them big, hey suppose we give him some magic potion?
Good day, which of you two gentleman is first or both of you at once maybe ja?
I'll go first and finish him off at once and then we go on to the next task.
All right but watch out, there must be a catch; he's got some funny clothes on.
No the robes don't make the druid!
Oh the fat gentleman first. ja
- I am not fat!
Yeah very well the fat one first.
- Listen you!
I say what a splendid way to fight;
I've never seen anything like it.
Ah ja I have learned it on my travels, long long travels far away.
You would like to have a go ja?
- Ja, yes sorry.
It's easy you have only to use the man's own strength to get them down.
The stronger he is the better for you.
Easy, easy you just say that because you're strong.
Nein, nein, word of honour, try yourself, here take my hand.
Put your foot right on the stomach, then raise backward, bend down.
Ja ja, harder harder!
Like this?
- Ja ja, you get the idea, ja ja.
Ja well done! Harder!
That's it!
- Was it really good?
Very good but a little bit soft ja. Lets do the next thing.
When you have got me on the ground, you take the advantage that I'm a little... dizzy and you jump on me, ja.
Like that?
- Gut! You take hold of my arm like this.
And then you pull, you tie a knot, gut! And then the other arm.
Excellent! And what will you think of next? The legs!
Right leg, wunderbar, left leg. Fantastic!
And now you can see I can't move at all, why you have beaten me, mein her!
They have got through the first two tasks all right, not bad but it proves nothing.
Rome is not Gaulish yet.
They've not had much to prove so far, now however the next task!
They will have to face the princesses of the Isle of Pleasure.
I never knew there was a lake here.
Well there is and you have to get across it that's your next task.
I shall go and wait on the other side.
Of course it's inconceivable you... should succeed, there is a boat over there, bon voyage.
I call this test a piece of cake.
We'll reach the other side in no time.
We'd better be careful though, you never can tell.
The lake is calm and the boat doesn't seem to leak.
Oh they sing better than Cacofonix.
Welcome to the isle of pleasure, we were expecting you, this way.
Nice little place you've got but who are you?
Never mind who we are, bold one give yourself up to pleasure.
This way we're going to show you all over our island.
And now you've seen our island, the island you will never leave again.
Your lightest wish will be our command. forever and ever.
What would you like oh warrior?
Some food.
- Some food?
Why not, I'm starved, dancing out in the open makes me hungry.
You're here on the isle of pleasure and the chief priestess herself has asked... what you would like and you ask for food?
Of course eating is a great pleasure.
This is the island pleasure isn't it?
All right we can provide nectar and Ambrosia.
Nectar, no fear, no fear, no none of that boring old stuff!
I want a nice wild boar, wild boar is very tasty.
You call nectar and Ambrosia boring?
Why that is food for the Gods themselves.
Well...Are you Gods or aren't you?
Well I suppose we may be
Gods but we eat wild boar.
But there aren't any wild boar on this island.
What! There aren't any boar
And you expect me to stay with you for good? You must be off your head!
Get lost fatty, do you really think I would lower myself to do your cooking?
And the washing up too.
- And housework!
And clean you shoes!
- Push off, get out!
You bet your life I'll get out, they have no wild boar and they dare to call... this the isle of pleasure! Come on
Asterix, there's nothing here for us.
Never mind him, we'll give you pleasure such as the Gods enjoy... on Olympus oh warrior.
Asterix!
The next task will take place in that temple.
What do we have to do in there?
- You will be required to look deep... into the dreaded eyes of the
Iris, the great Egyptian magician.
By Osiris and by Apis, look at me, look into my eye!
You have turned into a cat! By
Osiris and Apis, a cat. That's right!
By Osiris and by Apis there's a dear pussy cat, off you go little pussy cat.
Next please.
By Osiris and by Apis, look into my eyes, you have turned into a bird.
Yes a bird by Osiris and by Apis, a bird!
You saw that?
- Yes he was flying low, we'll have rain.
Next!
What is all this about? Yes I remember now, and which one of you is to... undergo my pleasure treatment? Sorry to rush you, my appointment book is very full.
I'll have a go.
- All right, seat yourself just there.
Ready then? I'll begin.
By Osiris and by Apis look at me! Look!
How do you do all that with your eyes?
Silence, concentrate please! By Osiris and by Apis look at me, look in my eyes!
By Osiris and by Apis you have turned into a... in what?
A wild boar! You Gauls are very fond of wild boar.
Lets start again. By Osiris and by Apis look in my eyes!
You have turned into a wild boar!
- Can you light one of them up at a time?
I'm Concentrating!
Where was I? A wild boar.
You are wild boar! A wild boar. do you hear? A wild boar.
Must be very useful for reading in bed.
Silence. I have to start again.
You are a wild boar, by Apirsi and by Osaris a boar, by the Usaris.
By Opis oh mama! You repeat after me: I am a wild boar,
I am a wild boar.
You are a wild boar; you are a wild boar.
- That's right. I am a wild boar.
I am a wild boar. A wild boar!
Iris made me hungry going on about wild boar.
What's more it's lunchtime.
Well that's lucky because your next task will be to eat every morsel... of a meal prepared for you by Mannechenpix.
The great chef of the Titans.
No mortal man has ever got through one of his enormous meals!
But you will have to eat it all down to the last crumb. Bon apetit.
An interesting kind of task at last, it's my turn now, right?
No doubt about that.
You are expected monsieur, sit down and I'll be bringing the banquet!
What's this?
- Ah this I have invented myself!
These are ruts that grow in the ground, I hope you'll like them.
The Geese! This is good because they are fat!
The nice mutton platter!
Made for the hungry wolf!
The titanic omelette! Eight dozen eggs!
The whole school of fish, that teaches you what is like to eat well!
The ox, look at him he will melt in your mouth!
This cow might not be as tasty but is much more delicate!
The veal, because to separate the family that would not be right.
A whole thing of caviar, large kind and there is more.
Here is a piece of toast to go with it.
The camel, this you will like, and it has a good stuffing too.
And before we start on the next course The elephant with olives!
Did he eat everything?
- Yes he ate everything!
I have nothing left in my kitchen!
Oh God, I will have to shut my shop!
Did anyone see which way the chef went?
He walked out, I just had the starters!
What on earth is all this?
What's up with you my fellow dressing in that awfully silly way?
It's not silly! I've got to get ready to be ruler or Rome, haven't I?
Ruler of Rome, well honestly.
When my lads have won all their tasks we'll be setting off for Rome.
For Rome? Do you really think
Rome will ever be Gaulish?
I think you are counting your wild boar piglets before they are hatched.
You think so?
- Yes, why don't you all go home?!
That's right, run along, leave us alone!
You don't think they will win?
- Caesar is mighty, he has made a pact... with the powers of darkness and only the Gods know what dreadful... dangers Asterix and Obelix may still have to face.
And now you must go inside the cave of the beast.
The cave of the beast? And what is this beast like?
I have no idea, no one has ever come out alive.
Well nice to have known you.
Coming Obelix? - Why not?
The place looks quite interesting.
How many then?
- EH? Two.
Watch out there, get down!
Hey Asterix...
- Yes I know we shall have rain with the birds fly low.
- Not really!
We can kept nice and dry inside this cave.
Fifteen all.
Excuse me please sir, are we right for the beast?
Look you might at least answer when I ask a question.
Beastly aren't they?
If they think they can frighten us, they are wrong, because everyone knows... that we fear only one thing frighten us and that is the sky falling on our heads.
Shhhh! Watch out.
What might that be?
- I have no idea, but I am really... getting rather fed up, we seem to have been in this cave quite some time.
Come to think of it what is the time?
- It's about twelve noon.
Are you hungry again already?
- Why shouldn't I be hungry?
I'm always hungry at twelve noon, I could eat anything at all!
You hear me? Absolutely anything
Shut up! Listen!
The Beast!
I hope you will forgive my curiosity, but the beast, what was it like actually?
Very tasty, waiter I'd like a drink.
We've only got lemonade.
Those people seem very odd by Tutatis!
They've all been to the place that sends you mad.
The place that sends you mad?
Yes and you'll have to go in there as well, that's your next task.
What do we have to do in this place?
- Oh nothing much!
You have to obtain a certain permit which will allow you to the next task.
I see nothing but a simple administrative formality.
Right, a formality, a simple formality you have to ask for permit number 838.
All right. Obelix!
What is it?
- We want a copy of permit number 838.
If you want to register a galley, you have to ask at the harbour masters office.
We don't want to register a galley, we want a copy of permit number 838.
At the port, it's down at the other side of town, it's down by the seaside.
We don't want to go to the port, we want a copy of permit number 838.
Eh?
- Permit number 838!
There's no need to shout, where do you think you are, by Jupiter!
Apply at window number one, left hand corridor, last door on the right, got it?
Last door on the right?
- Last door on the right?
There is no door on the right!
- Oh he must have got it wrong.
Lets try the door opposite.
And who gave you permission to come into my office?
We're looking for window number one.
- Consult the map on the 6'th floor.
Close the door. Impertinent!
Now where were we Miss?
These stairs are pretty steep.
Carry on.
This one?
- No this is the 4'th we want the 6'th.
Ah this is the plan.
- Can't make it out at all.
Window number one is on the ground floor, last corridor on the right.
What is your business?
- We want a copy of permit number 838.
You have been misdirected, you have to apply at window number 2.
Next door to this one?
- No that one is window 8.
You'd better ask at the front desk.
Where is window number 2?
- I've already told where the port is!
I don't want the port, I've told you!
- Now gentlemen calm down.
Someone is trying to work, and what is the problem may I ask?
I have no idea Mr. Prefect, they keep jabbering a lot of nonsense.
We are looking for window 2.
Window 2, where exactly did they put that one?
Last time anyone saw it, it was on the
3'ed floor, corridor B door 6. Mr Prefect!
There you are gentleman, there was nothing to be getting so worked up about.
We seem to be getting somewhere now.
- Mmmm, I'm not all that confident.
She bought some material from a
Phoenician trader for her cubiculum.
But how strange, how odd!
- She's the kind whose always got to... show off, she can't even afford a slave!
- Miss...
She says she preferred to do her house work herself!
I know her husband's financial situation.
- Excuse me...
Oh can't you see I'm busy, where was I?
- The financial situation.
Oh poor Claudius, you know he worked up a nice little business building viaducts.
Excuse me Miss!
- Would you mind?
Permit number 838!
- Have you filled in a blue form?
A blue form? No! -How do you think to get permit 838?
Where can I get hold of a blue form?
- Window one.
I've been there!
- That's right, that viaduct at the... first gust of wind crashed.
- Did it collapse?
Nothing left but some ruins. Still they look picturesque in the country.
She's at lunch but you could apply at window 35, ask downstairs.
Can't you get it right?
Fill in this form then you'll be able to get the pink form.
What pink form?
- The one you need in order to get... permit 838, window 12, second floor staircase B, corridor J.
You need the yellow form, window 7 on 5'th floor, staircase K corridor W.
Get the green window 14 on the first floor, staircase F, corridor T.
Get the blue form, window 36,
6th floor, staircase B corridor F.
Get the yellow form, window corridor staircase five...
Stop it!
Calm down Obelix, Clam down!
We will never get out of here Asterix, the magic potion won't be any help to us.
We will go mad and we'll be Julius Caesar's slaves.
Not if I know it, it's true the magic potion won't help us but I know what.
I can fight them with their own weapons, you watch this.
Is this where I get permit 839?
Don't you mean permit 838? For 838 you
- No no what I need is permit 839.
In the new circular B65? Wait here. Ever heard of circular B65?
Circular B65?
- The one about permit 839
Not me, we shall have to find out from the head of filing systems of... material not get coordinated.
- It's on the 5'th floor, staircase Z.
The office has moved to the second floor staircase H corridor N, shall we go?
Yes come on.
Circular B65, about permit 839? No.
The messenger of new circular or provisional material must have... forgotten to let us know. They are on ground floor, staircase 2 corridor U.
What a new circular? Go to supervisor of planning and new material.
Where is he? Lets go and ask down at the desk.
Calm down, quiet, quiet!
- Please sir...
I'm very busy just now, what are you after?
Permit number 838!
All right, and kindly leave some people here are trying to work.!
Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant.
Yes Caesar, they have performed them all, even that last task.
Hercules himself would have failed that.
Well, I must admit they are remarkable but they haven't yet got to Rome.
I have 7 special treats in stall for them, there is no need to worry, By Mercury!
We shan't be seeing a little Gaulish village becoming the capital... of the Roman world! We can proceed with the rehearsal now.
Well oh Caesar I guess the rehearsal is just about over.
Let's see what's next on the list,
You'll have to cross this canyon.
Walk across that invisible thread that you do not see there.
Walk along an invisible thread?
Why don't we cross down below it's just a small river and the water looks calm.
Yes but in fact that little river is full of crocodiles.
Lots of sacred crocodiles, they were a present given to Caesar... by the Egyptian head of state, Queen Cleopatra.
They are very savage creatures and very voracious.
Yes I don't like crocodiles, I tried them once, They were stringy.
Come on Asterix!
Oh all right, I suppose we should have to. Are you coming?
You start, I'll follow
Here we go!
Your next tasks is to make the ascent of this mountain.
A the top you must look for the old man of the mountains.
And what do we have to do with this old man of the mountains?
The old man of the mountains will ask a difficult riddle.
You will have to answer it correctly if you get it wrong the results... will be quite fatal, I mean as far as you are concerned of course.
Why can't this old man come down here to ask his riddle?
Come on don't be a lazy bones! Here we go!
There must be a marvellous view from up here.
Here I've run out of mountain side.
That's because you've got to the top, the old man can't be far away.
Would you be the old man of the mountain, old man?
I am the old man of the mountain, have you miserable mortals... come to ask for the riddle?
Well I'm glad we haven't been climbing the wrong mountain.
Come on ask your riddle old man of the mountains, it's not very warm up here.
One moment, do you know foolish men that if you fail to give me... the right answer, you will be banished into the eternal depths of hell?
After climbing all this way, not likely, I've got better things to do.
Come on, the riddle.
So be it oh mortals, follow me. Ow my back!
You ought to take a trip to the seaside, it'll do you good.
Oh you presumptuous mortals, one of you, eyes blind folded by me... but there is still time to go back.
Oh go on, ask your riddle.
One of you will have to tell me which of these two piles of laundry... has been washed with
Olympus, the Gods detergent.
This one, it's silkier, got that.
Yes, you've got it right! Sure enough this pile is much softer, much gentler.
Much whiter, the gods do their washing with Olympus which washes whiter... and leaves your hands much softer.
Holy Gods did you hear that? This mortal has given the right answer.
Holy Gods did you hear that.?
All right we can all hear you.
- Those Gauls lads are pretty good.
You must admit Olympus really does wash whiter and leaves your hands soft.
Ok we get the idea!
- You military men.
Silence, by me!
- But listen oh Jupiter, do these Gauls... who are doing so well, get a place up here too?
We're rather short of space as it is.
- Quiet! We don't let all and sundry... blight our path and to be honest
I'm getting fed up with them!
Rome's over there, not far away, but before you're allowed inside you have...
Spend the night on this plane? Ah good idea!
I feel a bit tired after those tasks, I need a sleep.
Yes but I must warn you that all those who have dared to spend the night... here before you have died of fear. it is called the plane of departed spirits.
Well good night! If that's the right expression.
What do you suppose happens on this plane?
I don't know and I don't care.
We must be fit and well tomorrow to enter Rome to tackle our last task.
Lets go to sleep now.
There's no need to go further, we'll be all right here.
Are you sure?
- Good night Obelix.
Good night Asterix.
Fall in!
Good some Romans! All those Roman just for me!
Forward march!
Don't make so much noise, you'll wake up Mr. Asterix.
Form a triangle!
A heart!
A diamond A spade!
A cubs
Away!
I'll chop off your head poor mortal, we are departed spirits, were ghosts!
Trapped on this cursed battle field where we were massacred because... of the queen and her men and now at this witching hour we take revenge... by making all those who dare to spend the night here die of fear.
What's going on around here?
What's all this row about?
Please Asterix don't be angry, they're only trying to keep their spirits up because they got parted by some witches and mad men.
No you've gone and got it all wrong,
I'll explain it, we are departed spirits.
I couldn't care less who you are, do you know what the times is?
Yes, no do please listen.
- No you can listen to me!
We've run a big race, we've been throwing the javelin, we've been wrestling... we've been how to face the princesses, magicians,
Big beasts, crocodiles, we need a good nights sleep!
You can keep your spirits up but kindless don't keep us up.
I'm sorry you must excuse him.
- Obelix come here.
Oh do listen we're only ghosts!
Quiet!
Get up you are expected.
But where are we?
You're in Rome outside Julius Caesar's palace, Caesar is expecting you.
There is something funny going on here.
The Romans have learnt to build very fast.
What does it matter? Come on then soldier take us to your leader.
Well here you are in Rome at last.
- Yes here we are Julius.
Caius has told me all about you journey.
Yes oh Caesar, they have managed to perform all talks. overcome all problems and succeeded every time.
The Gods have kept you alive, this is where your luck runs out.
It is impossible for you to become masters of Rome!
The last task will be the toughest!
Where you will be massacred.
Aa well as the other
Gauls from your village.
Here we are everyone.
Ah so this is Rome. frankly I'm disappointed.
I think the time has come to play you a little music.
Geriatrics!
Caesar, the Gauls request an audience.
It's the lads.
Here they are
- Look they've all come, Dogmatix.
Say you Gauls! Quiet!
Do you know where you are?
Silence! Silence I say! Silence!
You are all to be slaughtered for the amusement of my people!
And then nothing at all, nothing will cast a shadow on my triumph. Guards!
Well then, well then, which one is it?
That ones for the gladiators, that ones... for the ones with nets, that ones for
Fulvia, I wonder what's she's doing... in there, this one for the lions.
- I'll be happy to lend you a hand.
Caesar's just arrived!
- What a great big crowd!
Roll up everyone, it's ready!
It's the magic potion and I can't have any.
Will the owner of the cart parked in front of thermae, remove it?
Quickly cause is causing obstruction!
I hope everything is ready.
- Yes, Caesar, just to start, these... unhappy Gauls will have to face the fiercest of our Gladiators and if there're... any survivors, we will have to let out the wild beasts, we have lions, tigers... panthers and bears and elephants the audience will love this programme!
All right, you can bring out the gladiators.
Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant.
I think we should all get ready, it will soon be our turn.
Good I'm going in first and you all follow me and keep in line please.
We've got lots of people watching us so lets show some dignity.
And why should you go first?
- I'm your chief, that's why!
But we've been doing all the work haven't we Asterix?
So it's our turn to have some fun now.
- Some people get all the luck.
Who asked you?
- You stupid!
Who said stupid?
- Everyone stand back!
See my foot here?
We've been working hard and the stupid
- Stupid yourself fatty!
Oh Asterix he called me fatty!
You can let the Gauls out now.
Leave them to me! Leave them to me!
- No we won't! No we won't!
I'll smack your face!
- You Just try it!
I will!
- Go one, you just try!
Oh run away!
Let me have one! let me have one!
Oh hello!
- Hello!
I've won one!
- You won what?
Up here! Up here!
Pass him! Pass him to me!
Ow, I've injured myself!
Jolly good, jolly good, that's right!
- Oh yes? Take this!
Pass it on!
Aw who threw that pie at me? Who threw that pie?
Come on! Who did it?
Wild beasts, bring on the wild beasts!
Oh they are making the children laugh!
They ruined the circus!
Stop that! Will you stop!
You Gauls, You performed all 12 tasks
I set you, you've succeeded in every... one of the difficult tasks which I made up for you so you must be Gods.
It's no good trying to fight against
Gods, You are our new masters!
I leave my fate and that of
Rome entirely in your hands.
With great magnanimity the Gauls allowed Julius Caesar to retire to a... little country villa to live there in peace and quiet far from the... responsibility of the past.
Julius your dinner is ready!
What a really wonderful cook you are Cleopatra dear!
As for our friend Caius he was allowed to choose his won reward... for his good and faithful service.
And at last, back in Gaul, in the little village which is now the centre... of the known world, our friends reunited celebrated their return with a... banquet under the stars.
Have we really become the masters of Rome?
Lets face it this is only a cartoon film, and anything goes!
Anything goes!

UH, NO...

BUT, "THERE JUST

Together:

OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE IN MY STORE!
WHO ARE THEY, MA?
BEATS ME.
HOOLIGANS

THOSE RIVERBOTTOM BOYS.
Store Owner:

WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR REGULAR DAYS.
SORRY.
I REMEMBER THE LAST
CHRISTMAS BEFORE PA DIED...
OH, EMMET.
I REMEMBER DECORATING
THE CHRISTMAS BRANCH AND...
PA SANG AND...
YOU PLAYED
THAT OL' PIANO WE HAD.
I REMEMBER ALL RIGHT.
SELLING THAT OLD PIANO
WAS ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS
I EVER HAD TO DO.
SEEMS LIKE WE'VE SOLD
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
ABOUT ALL I'VE GOT LEFT IS
A SENSE OF HUMOR AND A WASHTUB.
WELL, AT LEAST THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
HEAD FULL OF GOOD THOUGHTS,
BELLY FULL OF GRUB,
MONEY IN YOUR POCKET,
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
SWEET AS HONEYSUCKLE
ON THE VINE, MA.
Together:
YOUR NAILS WON'T BREAK
AND YOUR TOES WON'T STUB,
YOU NEVER GET A FEVER
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.
IF YOUR BACK IS HURTIN'
I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.
Emmet:
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
LUNCH WITH
THE UPPER CRUST,
DINNER AT THE CLUB,
HIGH ON THE HOG
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
WATERMELON GARDEN,
BERRIES ON THE SHRUB,
COOKIES IN THE KITCHEN
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
HI, EMMET.
LOOK WHAT I CAUGHT!
GOOD CATCH, WENDELL!
YEAH, THEY'RE
REALLY BITING TODAY!
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
THERE GO TWO OF THE NICEST FOLK
ON THE RIVER.
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.
THOUGH IT TWISTS
AND CONTORTS YOU,
THAT BARREL SUPPORTS YOU.
YOU CAN FEED
AND CLOTHE YOURSELF
WITH A RUB-A-DUB-DUB
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.
AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.

THAT'S THE PRIZE!
LOTTA MONEY...

A MIGHTY FINE SINGING VOICE.
HMM...HMM.
ANYBODY'D BE INTERESTED
IN $50...
HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU ENTER, EMMET?
YOU'RE A GOOD SINGER...
I
ARE YOU KIDDING?
COULDN'T GET UP THERE

IT'D BE EMBARRASSING!
HI, HARVEY.

HEY, EMMET...
WENDELL,
HEY, LISTEN,
YOU TWO ARE JUST WHO
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
YOU BET.
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S UP, HARVEY?
WELL, YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE WATERVILLE TALENT CONTEST?
SURE, EVERYBODY'S
HEARD OF THAT.
RIGHT, EMMET?
WELL, YOU SEE,
CHARLIE AND ME
WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS
ORGANIZE A JUG-BAND.
YEAH, WOULDN'T
THAT BE SWELL?!
SEE, I PLAY KAZOO
AND WASHBOARD
AND CHARLIE HERE PLAYS
A GOOD CIGAR BOX BANJO.
I REALLY DO...
UH...MY MA SAYS.
MM-HMM.
SO ALLS WE NEED IS
A COUPLE OF OTHER GUYS
TO FILL OUT THE BAND.
WELL, HOW COME US?
WELL, YOU SEE,
YOU CAN BLOW
A JUG, WENDELL.
YEAH!
HEY, THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA, EMMET.
MAYBE.
WHAT WOULD I PLAY?
WHAT ELSE?
YOU GET TO PLAY
WASHTUB BASS.
WHY ME?
WELL, BECAUSE YOUR
MA'S GOT THE WASHTUB!
OH, NO!
FORGET IT,
COUNT ME OUT!
I'M NOT IN YOUR BAND,
AND THAT'SFINAL!
All:
AWWWWW.
CO
ME ON,
WHY NOT, EMMET?
BECAUSE, TO MAKE
A WASHTUB BASS,
YOU HAVE TO PUT
A HOLE IN THE WASHTUB!!
HMM...I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A PROPER COSTUME.
HETTY, I CAN'T POSSIBLY
ENTER THAT CONTEST!
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALICE.
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.
HETTY MUSKRAT, YOU STOP TRYING
TO SWEET-TALK ME INTO THIS!
THIS IS THE FENCE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEND?
WELL...
YEAH.
THAT'S NOT REPAIRING,
THAT'S REBUILDING.
DON'T JUST
STAND AROUND, BOYS.
YA GOT WORK TO DO.
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO GIVE
A FINE STORE-BOUGHT PRESENT
TO EMMET FOR CHRISTMAS.
AND WITH $50...
I'VE NEVER GIVEN MA
A NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
NEVER GAVE ONE TO PA, EITHER...
AND...NOW IT'S TOO LATE.
HARVEY SAYS $50
SPLIT FOUR WAYS IS $12.50.
LOTTA MONEY.
THAT GUITAR WE SAW IN TOWN...
THE ONE WITH
THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL INLAYS...
EMMET REALLYWANTS IT.
BUT...$40!
I CAN'T BUY A PIANO
FOR $12.50 ANYWAY...
BUT YOU COULDPUT
A DOWN PAYMENT ON A USED ONE.
BUT IF I DO ENTER,
I GOTTA HAVE A COSTUME.
AND TO BUY A COSTUME,
I'D HAVE TO HOCK SOMETHING.
HMM...
NOTHING LEFT TO HOCK.
OF COURSE, THERE'S
PA'S OLD TOOL CHEST.
BUT EMMET USES THAT
FOR ODD JOBS!
WE WOULDMAKE
A GOOD JUG-BAND...
BUT TO PUT A HOLE
IN MA'S WASHTUB...
HE SURE WOULD
LIKE THAT GUITAR.
NOTHIN' WOULD MAKE HER HAPPIER
THAN HAVING
A GOOD OL' PIANO AGAIN.
I JUST DON'T KNOW...
I JUST CAN'T DECIDE...
MA...
I'M HOME!
I CUT THE CHRISTMAS BRANCH.
OH, I SEE YOU DID.
WELL, AFTER ALL,
TOMORROW'S CHRISTMAS EVE
AND EVEN IF WE
DON'T HAVE PRESENTS,
AT LEAST WE CAN
HAVE THE BRANCH.
IT'S A NICE ONE, EMMET.
JUST LIKE
PA USED TO BRING HOME.
YUP.
EVERY YEAR HE'D GO OUT VOWING
HE WAS GOING TO BRING HOME
AREALWHOLE CHRISTMAS TREE.
HA! BUT HE NEVER HAD
THE HEART TO DO IT.
AND EVERY YEAR HE'D SAY...
"BECAUSE I DIDN'T CUT IT DOWN,"
"THE REST OF THAT TREE WILL
STILL BE ALIVE IN 100 YEARS."
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
YOU EVEN SOUND LIKE YOUR PA!
MA, DO YOU SUPPOSE IT'D BE
SAFE TO USE PA'S SLIDE NOW?
OH, I SHOULD
THINK SO!
THE ICE MUST BE SOLID
BY THIS TIME.
RACE YA TO HER!
HEY, WAIT FOR ME NOW...
FIRST SLIDE OF THE YEAR...
WHOOPEE!
WOW!
I FORGOT
HOW MUCH FUN
THAT IS!
WELL, STAND BACK!
IT'S MY TURN!
WHOOOO!
WOW, WASN'T
THAT GREAT?
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
GOOD ENOUGH
FOR WHAT?
GOOD ENOUGH
TO DO AGAIN!
HEY, NOW,
MY TURN NEXT!
WATCH, EMMET,
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN.
WHHHEEEEE!
OH, BOY!
OH, WATCH
THIS ONE, MA.
OHHHHHH!
OH, BOY.
THAT OLD SLIDE'S JUST ABOUT
THE BEST THING PA EVER BUILT.
YEAH, HE MAY NOT
HAVE LEFT US MUCH,
BUT THAT OLD SLIDE
IS JUST ABOUT ENOUGH.
GEE, I THINK
HE LEFT US A LOT.
WELL, HE LEFT
WHAT HE COULD.
PA USED TO SAY,
"A PERSON'S GOT
TO TAKE SOME CHANCES
"OR LIFE WILL NEVER
COME TO NOTHIN'."
HE TOOK HIS CHANCES
ON SNAKE OIL.
FACT THAT IT DIDN'T
COME TO MUCH HARDLY MATTERS.
PA WOULD HOCK
THAT TOOL CHEST.
PA WOULD PUT A HOLE
IN THAT WASHTUB.
MA, REMEMBER
PA'S FAVORITE SONG?
HMM...
WHEN THE MOUNTAIN
TOUCHES THE VALLEY
ALL THE CLOUDS
ARE TAUGHT TO FLY.
THUS OUR SOULS SHALL LEAVE
THIS LAND MOST PEACEFULLY.
Together:
THOUGH OUR MINDS
BE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS,
IN OUR HEARTS
WE'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA.
LIKE A FLOWER
THAT HAS BLOSSOMED
IN THE DRY
AND BARREN SAND,
WE ARE BORN AND BORN AGAIN
MOST GRACEFULLY.
THUS THE WINDS OF TIME
SHALL TAKE US
WITH A SURE
AND STEADY HAND
Together:
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA.
PATIENCE, MY BROTHERS,
AND PATIENCE, MY SONS,
IN THAT SWEET
AND FINAL HOUR
TRUTH AND JUSTICE
WILL BE DONE.
Ma:
LIKE A BABY
WHEN IT IS SLEEPING
IN ITS LOVING MOTHER'S ARMS
WHAT A NEWBORN BABY DREAMS
IS A MYSTERY,
BUT HIS LIFE
WILL FIND A PURPOSE
AND IN TIME HE'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA,
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE ALMIGHTY SEA.
HOOT! HOOT!
Emmet:
DEAR MA,
I'LL BE GONE ALL DAY.
I'LL EXPLAIN ABOUT THE WASHTUB
WHEN I SEE YOU LATE TONIGHT.
LOVE, EMMET
Ma:
DEAR EMMET,
I'LL BE HOME LATE TONIGHT
AND I'LL EXPLAIN ABOUT
THE TOOL CHEST WHEN I SEE YOU.
LOVE, MA.
All:
WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY
THAT DON'T LIKE SOUL FOOD
THEY'VE STILL GOT A SOUL.
AND IT DON'T MEAN THAT
YOU'VE GOT NO RHYTHM
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
ROCK AND ROLL.
BUT IF YOUR TASTE'S
LIKE MINE,
YOU LIKE CIDER,
NOT WINE.
AND YOUR VERY FAVORITE THING
TO DO
IS GET A PRETTY GIRL

WELL, YOU...
MAY BE POOR,
WITH THE WOLF AT YOUR DOOR,
BUT MONEY

AND A RIVER FULL OF FUN
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS
HAVE A SONG TO SING.
Emmet:

EVERYBODY'S A FRIEND.
WE CAN ALWAYS

EVERY DAY'S A SURPRISE.
LIVE A LIFETIME OF SURPRISE.
LOVE CAN OPEN YOUR EYES.

WHEN NIGHT LAYS SAD

SEE WONDER IN YOUR EYES.
LOVE CAN OPEN YOUR EYES.
WELCOME, BROTHER...

I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED SOMETHING
A LITTLE EXTRA,
BUT IT APPEARS TO ME

HE TOOK A CHANCE

OKAY BY ME, MA.
WHEN THE MOUNTAIN

ALL THE CLOUDS

THUS OUR SOUL

PATIENCE,
MY BROTHERS,

LIKE A BABY
WHEN IT IS SLEEPING,
IN ITS LOVING MOTHER'S ARMS,
WHAT A NEWBORN BABY DREAMS
IS A MYSTERY.
A MYSTERY.
BUT HIS LIFE
WILL FIND A PURPOSE
AND IN TIME
HE'LL UNDERSTAND,
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA,
WHEN THE RIVER MEETS
THE ALMIGHTY SEA.
CAPTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. www.captiontech.com
It's a time-honored profession.
An older one than yours.
Besides, you've had thousands of dollars worth on the house as they say.
- Bingo.
- Bingo.
Bingo!
I hope, Mr. Secretary, with this signing...
...France and the United States will begin a whole new era in our relations.
The president wanted to be here, but his wife... Look out!
Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut!
What are they doing in my shot?
Would you get them out?
- Isn't somebody posted out there?
- I'll see what happened.
Help yourself.
Would you get them the hell out of here?
Okay. Have we seen the doors yet?
- I don't think...
- No. Yes.
- I don't... I'm not sure.
- Lucy!
Have we seen the doors in any shot yet?
- No.
- Okay. Leave the doors shut.
Shut. I think.
Look, what's that damn redhead's name?
- Monique.
- Monique.
You're nowhere near emotional enough.
He murdered your husband.
You gotta have tears.
- I can't cry if I don't have menthol.
- I don't like using phony stuff.
- It's got to come out of the moment.
- I'm using menthol in my crying scene.
You don't have a crying scene.
Okay, let's take it from the top!
Makeup, could you get a menthol ball for Monique?
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Makeup!
Flying in!
Monique, look,
I've changed my mind...
Lauren?
Lauren?
Call me Bogie.
- Why?
- Because...
All right. No talking.
Quiet on the set.
Hold it. Hold it.
Are the squibs set?
Special effects?
When Monique fires, I want that mirror behind Brod to shatter.
Because they belong together.
Lauren and Bogie.
- Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart.
- It's a 12 million dollar picture.
You gonna tell me
I can't break one goddamn mirror?
They were married. Movie stars.
She called him Bogie.
That's why I said to call me Bogie.
Lucy, can I get a script over here?
- What are you reading?
- Nothing.
Lauren, darling.
What are you doing back here?
I bring you to watch the shooting, and you sit with a book.
- I got bored.
- How could you possibly be bored?
George is one of the finest directors in the world. I find this fascinating.
I could have done this goddamn picture in Spain, you know.
Can you believe this?
A 12 million dollar picture and they won't let me break one frigging mirror!
Sorry. I'm not used to having kids on the set.
It's nothing she doesn't hear every day at school.
I can show you the setup through the camera.
Oh, I'd love it.
You had it. You had it.
Your mother?
She's very attractive.
Is she an actress?
- No.
- I thought maybe you came to watch her.
No. She came out here to watch him.
- George De Marco.
- You know him?
Sure. Bloody Tuesday,
Lips, The Dandelion Train.
I don't go to movies much.
Is he good?
- He stinks.
- Really?
- He's the worst.
- You're not just saying that?
The only people who like his movies...
...are two critics in Paris and one in Pakistan.
I have to go.
It was good talking to you.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime.
Right. So long, sweetheart.
- I didn't know you knew French.
- I've lived here three years.
- How come you speak English?
- School, but movies mostly.
I like the American ones.
It's beautiful here, no?
It's awful places like this were built when so many Frenchmen were starving.
This is fabulous chicken. You're lucky to have a mother who can cook.
I don't have a mother. I made this, and my name isn't really Bogie.
- I thought you said...
- A joke.
You see, Humphrey Bogart was married with Lauren Bac...
Never mind. My name is Daniel.
- You from Paris?
- Just outside. La Garenne.
You live with your father?
What does he do?
He sort of drives.
- A truck?
- No.
- A taxi.
- You shouldn't be embarrassed.
- It's honest work.
- Not the way he does it.
- You have a father, or just a mother?
- I have a father. I'm on my third.
- Does she divorce or just kill them?
- They're still alive.
What does the latest one do?
- He's in telephones.
- Telephones? What does he do exactly?
Exactly, he's the head of ICT.
In Europe.
- So you're a capitalist.
- My father's a capitalist.
My own politics are more radical.
It's easy to be liberal when you're rich. I've seen it in films.
Kid! Your mother's got half the crew looking for you!
- I have to go.
- Me too.
- Thanks for the lunch.
- My pleasure.
- We can meet somewhere in Paris.
- When?
- Next week?
- When next week?
- Monday.
- Okay!
- Where?
- Where do you live?
Neuilly.
I see you at the gare St. Lazare, the train station, 3:00, Monday.
Under the clock.
Bingo!
Did you have fun out at that chateau today?
How's our friend George?
He was so busy directing, he barely said hello.
He's so inventive.
It's fascinating to watch him.
He has such a rapport with the actors and the crew. Could you tell, darling?
May I be excused, please?
Don't you want dessert?
I gotta call Natalie and get the homework.
On Friday night?
Don't be such a drudge.
- Watch some television.
- I missed a whole day of school.
I really don't want to get behind.
Excuse me.
She spent the time reading.
Shouldn't she be more interested in watching a movie being made?
Depends on the book.
I don't know what to do.
I hoped she'd enjoy herself.
She spent the whole time reading.
Natalie? Lauren.
What happened in school today?
We played soccer with the boys.
Billy and another boy chose girls...
...to be on their team.
Can you imagine how nervous I was?
- He's your cousin.
- Second cousin.
The kids don't come out funny.
I checked.
- Did he pick you?
- No.
How can you have kids if he won't even pick you for soccer?
In two years I'll fill out, my mother says. Then he'll pick me.
It's a start anyway.
- What's the math homework?
- Pages 226 through 232.
God, it's so hard!
And Mr. Stuart gave us an awful test!
He says you're going to have to make it up on Monday after school.
- Oh, no.
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't. I just can't.
- Why not?
- I met a boy.
- I can't stand it! Who is he?
- His name is Daniel.
- He's French! God, what else?
He lives in La Garenne and his father drives a cab.
- A cab? Your mother will have a fit.
- Lf she finds out.
- You'd better not tell her.
- Are you in love?
You don't fall in love with a boy you just met.
Are you?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna see him again?
- I don't know if I can.
- You'll see what I've been through.
You don't know love until you fall for your cousin.
- Second cousin.
- Right.
- Gotta go. See you Monday.
- Goodbye.
Reading something you don't want me to see?
- It's just a book.
- I used to read those too. What is it?
An Introduction to Metaphysics, by Martin Heidegger.
School has changed since I was in seventh grade.
- I'm just reading it for fun.
- Fun?
Heidegger?
Why were you hiding it from me?
Most people think anyone who reads Heidegger is weird.
I don't. But I have to admit that philosophy was never...
...one of my strong subjects in college.
Heidegger.
You really understand that?
Heidegger isn't all that hard.
His stuff is mostly etymological.
Like, "Why is there something rather than nothing at all?"
You seemed a little distracted at dinner. Anything wrong?
No, not really.
- Nothing happened that upset you?
- No.
I thought this summer we'd all take a trip together.
You and your mother and myself.
We could go to Germany.
- We've never been there together.
- That'd be nice.
- Maybe you could meet Heidegger.
- He died three years ago.
- We probably don't want to bother him.
- No.
Damn rich American girls.
They keep you waiting.
I'll count to 20, and if she's not here by that time...
...the hell with her.
One, two...
That's too fast.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
I speak English.
Don't strain yourself.
- God! I'm so glad I found you!
- Where is she?
- You'd never, ever find her again.
- What's your name?
- My name? Natalie Woodstein.
- Natalie, where is she?
- Oh, yeah. She can't come.
- Why not?
She got kept after school for a test.
We've got this mean...
- Did she say when we could meet?
- Can you come Wednesday instead?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- She wants to know where. Here?
- No, this is no good. Tell her:
The Arc de Triomphe du Carousel, in front of the Louvre.
- The Arc de Triomphe.
- No! Not the big one.
- The small one in front of the Louvre.
- In front of the Louvre.
Oh! That's the museum Louvre, right?
Okay.
Thank God she got it right.
I was afraid you'd be at the other
Arc de Triomphe...
...while I was down here cursing you.
- Natalie's okay.
She's just kind of terminally dense.
She's the only one in the school
I can stand...
- Something the matter with your foot?
- No. It's just new shoes.
They didn't have my size, but I liked them.
- They're very nice.
- Thanks.
- You sure you're all right?
- Fine.
Okay, then why don't we mosey on down here a piece?
Let me carry your books.
You know...
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I do that myself all the time.
Heidegger?
- Oh, it's for school, an assignment.
- They assigned you Heidegger?
- Sure.
- They are teaching you existentialism?
Heidegger isn't really an existentialist.
He claims he isn't.
His writing says he is.
- You read Heidegger?
- Not anymore.
He bores me. Especially his fascination with the tall German poet...
- What's his name?
- Hölderlin!
Ever struggle through that stuff...
...like "The Death Of Empedocles"?
It's awful. I bet the French translation is terrible.
- It's terrible in any language.
- I know! That's fantastic!
What's your IQ?
- I don't know.
- You mean you've never been tested?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm afraid I might find out I'm...
- What?
A genius or something weird.
Well, people don't exactly love smart kids.
I know.
I'm 167 IQ.
I won't tell anybody.
And I read Heidegger because
I want to, not for school. I was lying.
I lie all the time. You have to.
- Are you good at math?
- I'm sensational!
Especially things like probability.
- I've won 850,000 francs on the horses.
Just on paper, naturally.
That's fantastic!
Fabulous!
- You are English!
- No, I'm American.
I love Americans!
I was stationed there for a time.
Washington.
You have been there?
- Once when I was little.
- Extraordinary city.
Very like Paris in many ways.
- You sure you're all right now?
- Perfectly, my dear.
Allow me to present myself.
Julius Edmond Santorin, retired.
To show there's no hard feelings...
...will you join me in a hot chocolate and pastry?
- I know a delightful spot nearby.
- No, thank you. We...
Okay.
Good.
It's years since I was in Washington, but I have many fond memories.
We'll have lots to talk about.
I've never been there.
I'm from La Garenne.
I have been there too. Come along!
And so, Emilienne, we had not been married very long...
...and she was not all that sophisticated coming from Provence...
...was offered vodka by the Russian ambassador...
...and she, thinking it was water and following the other guests...
...swallowed it straight back.
You can't imagine her surprise!
I shall never forget her expression.
You were the ambassador to the United States?
I was simply a humble attaché at the embassy.
I didn't become ambassador until the end of my career.
Then it was Liechtenstein.
Delightful spot...
...but hardly the top of the diplomatic ladder.
Oh, that's fantastic!
What an incredible life you must have had.
Please. Julius.
- You make me feel my years less.
- How old are you?
No longer young, Daniel.
No longer young.
- Your wife Emilienne?
- She has been gone 12 years now...
...to this very day.
I was on my way to the cemetery...
...when I ran into a large, round object.
A football, I think it is called.
- I never saw it.
- I said I was sorry.
She won't mind my being a little late.
I go to see her every week...
...with all the breath, smiles and tears of all of my life.
- And if God choose...
- And if God choose...
...I shall but love thee better after death.
- You know it?
- Elizabeth Browning, my favorite poet.
- She was ours too.
- Fantastic!
Yes! She's no longer so much in the fashion...
...but how we loved her.
I'll tell you a little story.
When Emilienne and I lived in Venice...
...we rented a small villa.
One Sunday the plumbing went out...
...and I couldn't get a plumber so I went down to make some repairs myself.
And crawling about in the dark
I came upon some papers.
Poetry.
- Have you guessed?
- No.
We had been living in the
Brownings' villa and didn't know it!
- Fantastic! Were they new poems?
- No, mostly drafts...
...which improved when they were published.
Some of the
Sonnets from the Portuguese...
...and pages from a journal she kept describing the people they met...
...the places they went, the trips to the Lido...
...the kiss under the bridge.
- What bridge?
There is an old Venetian legend which says that...
...if two lovers kiss in a gondola under the Bridge of Sighs...
...at sunset when the bells of the campanile toll...
...they will love each other forever.
And they did?
She died in his arms some years later.
And you and Emilienne?
The legend is true.
- Isn't he the most incredible person?
- Incredible.
I mean, what a life he's had.
He's so dear, so sensitive, you know?
Don't you think so?
Isn't he wonderful?
Yes, he is wonderful.
I'm having a birthday party a week from Friday. I want you to come.
Okay.
Hi, Mother.
Hello, darling.
- Hi, Richard.
- Hello, sweetheart.
How does this sound for the party?
Caviar on tiny potato skins, smoked Scotch salmon...
...oysters on the half shell, champagne and Russian vodka?
I'd just as soon have cake and ice cream.
- What are you talking about?
- My party.
This is for George's wrap party.
Wrap party?
- Don't you know any of the jargon?
- I guess not.
When a movie finishes shooting, there's a wrap party.
- You invite the actors, producers, crew.
- So we're having them all here?
Of course not. I'm just having George, the cast, a few critics...
...friends, the Schwartzes, Bernard
Durand, food editor of Le Monde.
- When is it?
- The 3rd.
But that's my birthday.
We're not gonna have a party?
Shooting ends on the 3rd. On the 4th, everybody's leaving but George.
- I'm sorry.
- I've got an idea.
Lauren can invite some friends to the wrap party.
Combine them. Lauren's birthday and
George's wrap party. What do you say?
- Okay.
- Thank you, darling.
Okay.
In a way, that solves one of my problems.
Who is she going to invite to her party?
She doesn't have any real friends other than that Natalie.
I know. It's been hard for her, being the kind of kid she is...
...living in a foreign country these last few years.
- That's why I've changed my mind.
- About what?
I've accepted that transfer to Houston.
We're leaving next month.
- We talked about that, and l...
- I know.
I think we made the wrong decision.
For Lauren.
And for us.
Well, but...
But Houston's so... Well...
Houston is so...
Houston.
Until about 500 B.C., the Greeks perfected their carving techniques.
You can see these statues are different from those Egyptian statues...
...in their depiction of the human form.
Praxiteles, for example, is a master.
See how he really shows the anatomy as it is.
Notice the detail of the musculature.
Over here, on the other hand, we have Doriphor by Polyclitus...
...and a perfectly splendid example of the school of Athens...
...the magnificent Torso of Apollo.
The strength of Greek sculpture is due...
Have you ever seen a real one?
One what?
Sure.
Whose? His?
- Whose?
- You know, his. Daniel.
Sure.
God! Have you ever, you know?
Done it?
- All the time, every which way.
- God, Lauren!
I would've preferred to have waited, but you know the French.
Works like this aren't mentioned by the classical Greek...
Where?
- Where what?
- Did you do it?
There's this old mattress in his cellar, and we...
God!
As we come downstairs, we'll see on our left the Apollo Belvedere.
The original is in the Vatican.
It was supposed to show the ideal model of a man's body.
Note the bow in the extended arm and the head turned sideways...
...as if following the arrow with his eyes.
This is only a replica, not a very good one.
Let's proceed to a later period.
I want you to come to my birthday party on Friday.
Invite me over to your place tomorrow night.
What for?
I don't really want you to invite me over.
I wanna go out with Daniel.
I wanna tell my mother
I'm at your place doing homework.
When you're supposed to be at my house...
...I suppose you'll be doing it in the mattress in the cellar!
I was teasing you.
We've never done anything except go to the movies.
- Really?
- Really. He's never even touched me.
If you ever do, promise to tell me about it?
Okay.
Three seconds of bare ass and they won't let us in.
We'll take our business where we're treated like adults!
- We don't have to do this.
- Yes, we do.
Have you seen those movies before?
Sure. Londet's father owns this porno house. We go all the time.
- That was it?
- Yes.
- Why did we go past it?
- You'll see. Just follow Londet.
They get right to it.
I just noticed there aren't any subtitles.
I sort of get the gist of it anyway.
She's so pretty.
Why would she...?
What is he making her do?
I've never seen one of those before either. I wouldn't have taken you.
It isn't like that.
That's something else.
It isn't love.
I used to think...
...maybe a long time ago, like...
...like in the time of the pharaohs...
...or Louis Xlll...
...that there was somebody...
...made just perfect for me.
I mean, when you think about it...
...and consider that your feelings of love...
...begin when you're about 10...
...and if you live to, say, 70...
...well, that's pretty limiting, because what chance is there...
...that he'll be alive at the same time you are?
I feel the same thing.
I mean, even if she lived in my lifetime...
...what if my perfect woman lived in India or California or Brazil?
What chance is there that I meet her when I live in La Garenne?
- It's incredible, isn't it?
- Absolutely.
Incredible.
A six-month shooting schedule must be killing you.
Hey, Brod.
Brod! I'm so flattered that you could come.
George told me you never show up at these affairs.
What the hell? The booze is free and maybe I'll get laid.
He is such a delight.
All next week, it'll be mixed soccer.
Billy Duchin will be permanent captain.
Yesterday, I bribed him to pick me at least once. God! Isn't it romantic?
- Having a good time?
- Fine.
- You could have invited more friends.
- They were busy.
- Billy Duchin and Jimmy Ford could come.
- I don't want them. I barely know them.
Sorry it's not much of a birthday party.
It's no big deal.
- Yes?
- We came to see Lauren.
Lauren. Lauren!
- Hi, Daniel.
- Hi. I brought Londet.
- Bonsoir, Londet.
- Good night, yes.
Mother, this is Daniel Michon and his friend, Londet.
Londet, this is Natalie.
Lauren thought you weren't coming.
I'm her father.
Good to meet you, sir.
Lauren speaks highly of you.
I'm delighted you could come.
Thank you for exciting me.
Why don't we go up to my room?
What a lovely idea.
Go on ahead.
I don't know, letting Frenchmen in your daughter's room.
Could be dangerous, huh?
- Yes. I don't.
- Is it okay that I brought Londet?
Sure. He and Natalie are made for each other.
With her French and his English, they won't understand a word.
This is your room?
It doesn't look like you.
I know. My mother decorated it.
The only thing here that's me is me.
- What'd he say?
- He sleeps in a bed with his sister.
God, how awful!
She's great-looking and has huge boobs.
What'd he say?
He said he has a great amount of affection for her.
- Where'd you get that?
- We can't toast your birthday with Coke.
- Great, come on.
- I'm not having any.
At least try some, Natalie.
- I like your father.
- Richard? Yeah. He's nice.
Why you call him Richard?
I called the first two "Daddy." It's easier to lose a Richard than a father.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Come on.
My birthday.
You drink champagne.
God!
- Happy birthday, Lauren.
- Happy birthday, Lauren.
Look, presents!
Let's open the presents.
- Okay.
- Let's open your gifts.
It's a book. It's Nancy Drew and the Ghost of Blackwood High.
- Hope you don't already have it.
- No.
It's one I missed.
Thanks, Natalie.
You can't give this up.
I want you to have it.
I couldn't get one of Heidegger.
God!
Lauren.
God.
Thank you, Londet.
What I find absolutely devastating about your work...
...is the way you go beyond the rationally acceptable.
You're looking for art in that beyond, wanting the unknown...
...the dangerous, to take over.
You're such a reckless artist.
You're almost irresponsible.
Yes, but just when you think you're totally out of control...
...you suddenly astound us by making us...
...face our innermost frustrations.
- Right. I'm glad you got that.
Many people don't get that in my work.
Shooting a film is the easy part.
Hey, kid, how'd you do?
Did you score?
I heard a story about a French boy...
- You apologize to her!
- It was a joke!
Your jokes are as rotten as your movies.
The winner and new champ by TKO.
Hell of a right hand there, kid.
Like when you hit Ward Bond in Sin Town.
- Who?
- Ward Bond.
- In what?
- Sin Town. Don't you remember?
Ward Bond.
Sin Town.
I'm fine. He caught me,
I just wasn't ready.
Lauren, upstairs to your room immediately. You, out.
- Simmer down.
- I want him out.
- My coat is upstairs.
- Get it!
Dinner is served, everyone!
They've been drinking!
Richard, he's gotten her drunk!
- What have you gotten into?
- Wait a minute, Kay!
Hey, kid. Are you sure that wasn't
Richard Widmark I belted?
No. You never made a picture with Widmark.
I didn't?
What is going on...?
Jesus Christ, Richard!
Get in here!
- They've been having an orgy!
- Don't be ridiculous!
What were you doing?
We had champagne and I opened my gifts.
Gifts?
Some gift!
- I'd better go with Londet.
- Au revoir, Natalie!
Lauren!
It wasn't all...
You are never to see that boy again, ever.
Until school is over. Then it won't matter. We're leaving for the States.
The States?
Your father took a job in goddamn Houston.
We leave at the end of the month.
Get used to the idea.
- Why now? What's the hurry?
- I just wanna be able to see you.
It'd be easier if we waited until summer.
Then we could take off somewhere.
- I don't wanna wait.
- Why not?
Who knows what'll happen in the summer? I wanna go now.
- We'd get caught.
- Eventually.
- Where would we get money?
- I've got Christmas money saved up.
Christmas money won't get us far.
This is really a terrible movie.
All De Marco's movies are terrible.
I told you, he stinks.
My mother's been watching me like a hawk.
This is the only place she'd never suspect we'd meet.
You really want to take off now?
Maybe we can make it for a week before we get caught.
- You mean it?
- Where do you wanna go?
- Venice.
- Why Venice?
That's where people go who are in love.
- But that's in Italy. It's...
- Please?
Venice it is.
Don't keep me waiting with no money!
I couldn't leave without Natalie.
She was late.
- What did you want?
- I've got an idea.
- Keep an eye out.
- I wanna hear. I helped you sneak out.
- Natalie!
- I won't move.
Don't worry.
God, it's him!
- She doesn't know what we're planning?
- Of course not.
How much was that
Christmas money you have?
- About $ 150.
- Okay. Here is my idea.
I told you about my system with the horses.
- I've won over 850,000 francs.
- On paper.
I can take your 150 and try to hit a parlay.
- How often do you win?
- About 45% of the time.
- Which means 55% of the time you lose.
- I'm not a computer.
Would a computer help?
Sure.
Sure! You can take all the variables for each horse in every race...
...cross-program performances, make out ones for different jockeys...
...different distances...
- What's that for?
You really are smart, you know?
- Yes?
- Mr. King, your daughter's here.
She is? Send her in.
Take these to Kendall.
Have him sign them and mail them out.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- I need a project for science.
I chose computers. I was wondering if I could play around with one.
- Maybe you could show me.
- Because I run this place...
...doesn't mean I know how these machines work. We have people for that.
I'll get somebody who understands.
- Claudine?
- Yes, Mr. King?
Take Lauren down to operations...
...and tell Martin that she'll be asking questions.
- Of course, Mr. King.
- Now, you see? Simple as that.
Thanks, Richard.
How's Daniel?
- Mother told me I can't see him.
- I know.
You like him?
How can I not like somebody who punched George?
Martin can see you now, Lauren.
Thanks.
There we go.
Now, Miss King, what kind of information are you looking to get?
I want the three horses with the best chance to win...
...each of the eight races at Longchamp tomorrow.
I need to program the performance charts for each horse going back for a year.
Then I want to cross-correlate the data...
...taking into account the variables of different times and distances.
- Forget it.
- Why?
I've been developing a program to do that for a year.
I'm not even close.
Would...
Would you mind showing me your theory?
Show you my theory?
Just give you 10 months of my calculations? Is that what you want?
You said it isn't working.
Maybe I can help you with it.
I got it!
I got it! Look!
- It's useless.
- What?
I said it's useless. All our work.
The whole damn thing.
- Why?
- Because we are stupid, that's why.
I'm stupid. You have to be 18 to place a bet.
- You do?
- Even if we won, we still couldn't go.
- Why not?
- We can't cross the Italian border.
- Why not? We don't need visas.
- They won't let kids across alone.
We need an adult.
- Are you sure?
- Positive. I checked.
Can we sneak across?
There will be border guards, barbed wire, machine guns.
I've seen it in films.
I want to go to Venice.
I'm not gonna give up this trip.
All we have to do is concentrate.
- I've got it. I've got it! Come on!
- Wait! What is it? Wait!
Yes!
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
Voilà.
We have won all this?
Why don't we stop now?
We can get to Venice on what we have in great style.
Last time I was there, Emilienne and I stayed at the Gritti Palace...
...for 200 francs a day.
- Okay. 5000 on number...
Five thousand?
Five thousand on number six to win.
Trip Across.
Scratched! Damn!
Scratched.
- Wait a minute.
- Pick the next horse, then.
No. Something's wrong here.
I should've seen it before.
Your computer screwed up.
Monaco never did well before...
...and your computer friend picked it to place. Impossible!
- Snow Queen.
- But the readout...
I've won with Snow Queen before.
Put it on number two,
Snow Queen, to win.
Come on.
Come on.
There is no way that Fille De Fermier could've won that race. No way.
It's okay. Don't feel bad.
We came close.
- Where's Julius?
- Getting a drink somewhere, probably.
What does it matter?
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't your fault.
I should have followed your instructions.
It was wrong of me.
- Whatever the result, I apologize.
- What are you talking about?
I didn't bet on Snow Queen.
At the last moment,
I had this sudden hunch.
And I put all the money on Fille De Fermier.
You mean we won?
Fille de fermier in French means
"farmer's daughter."
Emilienne was a farmer's daughter.
Actually, he owned 30,000 hectares...
...but technically, he was a farmer.
You're the most wonderful man in the whole world, Julius!
I spent a week handicapping these horses and you win on a lousy hunch?
I'm afraid so. What does it matter?
The important thing is that Lauren gets to Venice to see her poor mother...
...who, at the sight of her, will recover much, much faster, won't she?
Would you rather we had lost?
If we'd lost we couldn't go, and now we can.
If you think Julius is so wonderful, why don't you just go with him?
Because Venice wouldn't mean anything to me without you.
And he lost all of our baggage, except for two pieces.
One containing seven pairs of my shoes...
...and a small case containing all of Emilienne's lingerie.
You couldn't buy clothes in Nairobi in those days...
...so for a full week I could change nothing but my shoes...
...and Emilienne, her underwear.
And I was furious, but Emilienne just laughed and laughed.
She had a very hearty laugh for a small woman.
It surprised many people.
Well, I think I'll go to the club car for a Dubonnet.
- Unless you care to come along?
- No, no, you go ahead.
Well, I will be back shortly.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Something's wrong. What is it?
It's hard to have a good time, knowing my parents might be worried.
Why would they be worried about you?
They think you're in Mont-Saint-Michel on a field trip for three days.
Don't they?
So?
If Natalie calls they'll find out there's no trip.
You were supposed to call her and tell her not to call you.
- I forgot.
- You forgot? How could you forget that?
- There's so much on my mind...
- You want to get caught!
- That's not true!
- Is too!
- Is not!
- Is too.
Is not.
Is too.
- Hello?
- Natalie?
- Lauren, where are you?
- Why?
I called you. Your mom wanted to know why I wasn't in Mont-Saint-Michel.
I said, "Why would I be there?"
She got all hysterical.
She started absolutely pumping me.
She talked about calling school.
Oh, no.
- Lauren.
- What?
- Why are you at Mont-Saint-Michel?
- I'm not.
- What are you doing?
- Calling Natalie.
- Hang up!
- Tell my parents I'm okay.
- Where are you?
- I'm in Italy. I'm okay.
- Hello?
- Mrs. King?
It's Natalie. I just talked to Lauren on the phone.
She's in Italy! I guess she got away long enough...
- Where in Italy?
- I don't know.
They made her hang up before she could say.
I can't believe you'd do a stupid thing like telling her you're in Italy.
- She sounded so worried.
- Incredible.
- Now where's Julius?
- He was in the club car.
No, there he is.
Julius!
- Julius!
- You better get him.
- Which the great Lucian said:
"He may have been an impostor."
Julius, the train, it's leaving!
I left my money in my vest...
...and my vest is on the train!
Halt!
Stop!
- The money's in his vest!
- We've got to get off.
But we'll lose the money!
The train is going too fast.
He'll never make it.
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.
- You should have gone without me.
- No, we couldn't.
The money's on the train.
If there's one thing
I've learned about life...
...if you miss one train, there's always...
What? There is always what?
There is always...
...one's feet.
It is very kind of you to offer us a lift.
You have to be very careful who you pick up on these roads.
You could be robbed, you could be kidnapped.
- You could be bored to death.
- We're tickled pink for the company.
We haven't run into anybody that could speak decent English in a week. Right?
Where can we drop you folks?
We don't want to take you out of your way.
- Where are you headed for, Mr...?
- Duryea. Bob Duryea. Columbus, Ohio.
- Columbus.
- The missus.
We thought we'd spend the night at Verona and then go on to Venice.
Well, that'll be just fine.
Just fine.
She sounded awfully scared and said she was in Italy.
I heard a kidnapper tell her to hang up.
- Are you sure it's a kidnapping?
- Of course it is!
You read about them.
You're doing nothing!
It is a classic case, like in one of my movies.
This is life imitating art.
The Italian police say your daughter was aboard a train...
...when it stopped at the border in Italy.
The telephone company says she called Paris.
To me! God!
They got off the train in a hurry...
...leaving behind a coat with 18,000 francs.
The ransom money!
There's no ransom.
Nobody's contacted us.
She was traveling with two people.
One's named Michon.
We have no record of him.
- Daniel! God, they've got them both.
- What?
- Michon, that's Daniel's last name.
- My God, that filthy French boy!
Not that the French are filthy.
It's just that this particular French boy...
...is.
The man who's with them is another matter.
Julius Edmond Santorin.
He has a long criminal record.
People think Romeo and Juliet...
...were the product of Shakespeare's imagination, that is not so.
As a matter of fact, Romeo and Juliet were born right here in Verona.
- I don't believe this.
- You don't?
Excuse me, I didn't mean you.
Janet, how many shrimp did you have?
- Four. No, five. Five.
- That's right. That's what I had.
See that guy over there, at the next table, that Italian? He has seven.
Don't tell me they don't see Americans coming.
Romeo and Juliet came from right here in Verona.
Tomorrow we can see
Juliet's tomb and the balcony...
My wallet! My wallet's been stolen!
- Bob!
- It's gone!
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure!
I put it in this pocket when I cashed a check.
- Right, I saw you. That's terrible.
- Yes, you did.
- How much did he get?
- I don't know.
Must've been a couple hundred dollars, whatever that is in lira.
Damn country! Luckily, I let Janet take my credit cards and traveler's checks.
You've both been so very kind to the children and to me.
- Please, let me pay for it.
- I couldn't let you do that.
- I would really feel it an honor.
- That's very nice.
- I mean, it's so embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing at all.
And if you please...
...here is just a little contribution towards the gasoline.
- That's very... No, I couldn't.
- Thank you so much.
- Otherwise, we couldn't go on.
- What's money?
Yes, thank you. It's so embarrassing.
He's very nice, isn't he, darling?
Hello!
- Good morning!
- How are you?
I'm fine.
Good morning, sir.
Where are Romeo e Julieta?
Romeo and Julieta?
The little boy and girl.
They couldn't wait.
They got up early and went sightseeing.
- What are you looking for?
- The Grand Canal.
- The Grand Canal is in Venice.
- I know.
- We're in Verona.
- I know we're in Verona.
I left the Verona guide in Padua.
- What do you want to see in Verona?
- A hairdresser.
Janet, you just had your hair done yesterday.
Look at it.
You're right. You look for a hairdresser...
...l'll go look for a good cup of coffee.
Janet, look. No, don't look.
Over your left shoulder, that man reading the paper.
- Isn't that that girl, Loretta?
- Lauren.
- Lauren, yes.
- Yes.
What's she doing in a foreign newspaper?
Well, read it.
What does it say?
Dove.
You speak the language.
What does it mean?
- Bird. Peace.
- It doesn't mean bird or peace.
- Wrong. "Where."
- What?
- They want to know where she is.
- She's right up here, isn't she?
- I don't know.
- Let's get a paper.
I can't believe we've actually seen it.
I mean, the real Juliet's balcony.
Fantastic, huh?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?
About this!
You lied to me.
You weren't going to Venice to see your sick mother.
You were running away, both of you.
And you have made me a kidnapper!
I'm sorry, Julius.
We'll explain everything to them.
They won't listen to you.
Don't you understand me?
- They'll put me away.
- Put you away? What for?
Because I'm...
I'm...
I can explain.
If we don't get out of here fast, we're gonna be explaining to the cops.
They'll be watching the station, checking cars.
You're right.
Daniel!
Daniel!
We've got to go back.
He'll never catch up.
All right.
Where is he?
You didn't have to try to win.
All we had to do was get out of town.
Good idea.
Let's get these off.
Yes.
I never did like wearing a number when I didn't have to.
So...
...what kind of crook are you?
Burglar?
Arsonist?
Embezzler?
A pickpocket.
English.
A language totally lacking in imagination or subtlety...
...but yes, I am a pickpocket.
I'm sorry, Lauren.
The money to pay for dinner last night?
I had to get you to Venice.
How else was I to pay for the food...
...and the rooms and the bicycles?
Julius.
It gets worse.
- That day at the races...
- I don't want to hear.
Well, I do. Go on.
The horse you picked for the last race lost.
Yes, but the horse you picked won.
Thank you for thinking that, but if I could pick horses...
...I wouldn't have to pick pockets.
- You stole that money.
- Yes.
- 20,000 francs?
A good day.
Your hunch wasn't better than my system.
Why did you do it?
Because I had to get you to Venice to see your poor, sick mother.
Are any of us so blameless?
What will we do now?
Venice is out of the question.
They know we were heading there.
It will be alive with police.
Well, at least we got to Verona.
Almost as good as Venice.
After all, Verona was good enough for Romeo and Juliet.
True, it didn't turn out so good for them, but...
I haven't told you something.
What?
I have to go back.
We always knew we'd get caught sooner or later.
No.
I mean back to the United States...
...in two weeks.
For vacation?
For good.
That's why I wanted to go to Venice.
Not just to run away...
...but so we could kiss under the Bridge of Sighs...
...at sunset when the bells tolled...
...the way the Brownings did.
And then we could love each other forever.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I was afraid you'd think it was dumb, and it was.
It was all a bunch of lies, wasn't it? All of it.
You never lived at the
Brownings' villa, did you?
No.
And Emilienne, she was a lie too, wasn't she?
Well...
There was an Emma...
...I loved very much.
But she was young and couldn't wait for me to finish my term in prison.
But no, there was no Emilienne.
She was a fantasy.
She was a lie!
She was an attempt to bring...
...a little romance into my life.
That's pretty sad.
Any sadder than sitting in a darkened theater...
...pretending you are Robert Redford performing heroic deeds?
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot it out with the bad guys?
No, I'd take the girl I love to Venice and kiss her under the Bridge of Sighs.
Why? That legend is just another one of your damn lies.
You could make it true.
Legends are but stories about ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Of course, it takes courage and imagination.
Not everybody has that.
I may be an old fraud, Daniel, but I do know this:
Something that two people who are in love...
...create together against impossible odds...
...can hold them together...
...forever.
Where are you going?
Venice.
Who else wants to come?
Police are police, in Venice or Verona.
I hope they don't expect us to do this in here.
- Bonjour, Madame King.
- Bonjour.
Monsieur De Marco, Monsieur King.
This is Mr. Michon, Daniel's father.
Would you please come in?
We have just received word that they were seen in Verona.
- Are they still there?
- We don't think so.
There was a local athletic event they used to slip past the authorities.
I could do a better job of finding these kids.
You're free to try, monsieur.
Perhaps you could win yourself another merit badge.
Do you know what we're going through?
- The thought of Lauren with a pervert...
- He isn't a pervert.
He has a record as a pickpocket, not a kidnapper or molester.
You want to know what I think?
- I think she ran away with Daniel.
- Ran away? Richard...
If they ran away, why is the old guy with them?
I don't know.
- Why would she run away?
- They were spotted again.
I'm flying to Venice to coordinate things. Care to go with me?
Yes. Thank you.
- There's a flight leaving at 12:15.
- I'll meet you there.
I want to come with you.
Well, someone has to stay here in case she calls.
- Kay, listen, it is a good idea...
- George.
- Yeah?
- Lf you don't mind...
...I don't think we're going to need to see any more of you.
- I think that's up to Kay, not you.
- It's up to Kay and me.
I've been standing around watching this go on between you...
...being too civilized to fight for her.
If I'd told her how much I care, she wouldn't need you.
- You don't have to listen.
- She does.
You're forgetting I've been in your shoes. I'm her third husband.
I took her away from somebody myself.
You came along when Kay needed excitement, but it wouldn't last.
All you're interested in is seeing if you can take her from me.
Well, you can't.
He's been nice enough to offer us a ride. Get in.
- You're being highhanded.
- I'm sure you can find your way home.
The basilica of San Marco was built between 1063 and 1073.
The five great domes were added during the 13th century...
...and after the sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the Venetians.
Byzantine artists were brought in to transform this basilica...
...into the treasure we are about to see.
- Yes, ma'am?
- How much did it cost?
That's hard to say, but in today's terms, several hundred million dollars.
Then you'd think they could get it cleaned.
Well, I wouldn't know that.
- Please follow me.
- Notice this end is sinking?
- Much more. I wonder why.
- Maybe because that end is rising.
How long are we staying?
And here is good evidence that Venice continues to sink on its own foundation.
You can see the watermarks here where the flood of 1966...
...flooded the whole floor of the basilica...
...and filled the crypt up to the ceiling.
Rough seas and high tides remain a present and increasing danger...
...to the preservation of San Marco as well as all the banks.
Solutions are being sought.
But the experts' opinions conflict.
Now, if you follow me, we shall begin the visit of the basilica...
...from this altar.
It was dedicated to the Madonna and finished in 1617.
Above the altar, you can admire the Madonna of Nicopeia...
...the renowned and highly venerated icon...
...which was brought here from Constantinople in 1204.
There are more than 40 iconographies of the virgin in St. Mark's.
She welcomes you at the threshold of St. Peter's...
...and the chapel of St. Clement.
And she is repeatedly portrayed in the crusades...
My God.
Do you wish to confess, my daughter?
Bob!
- Quick. Come on.
- I'm so tired.
You can rest later.
Come on, quickly.
- I can't go any further.
- Yes, you can. Come on.
Gondola! Hello!
Gondola.
- Maybe we should...
- What?
Take that gondola and head to the Bridge of Sighs now.
- It's too early. The legend says sunset.
- What legend?
Our legend. It's going to be sunset when the bells toll or not at all.
Now, come on.
Julius!
Wait, wait.
The police are there.
We'll go in there.
- No. Not this one.
- Why not?
I'd rather be captured than sit through that again.
- That one.
- Yes!
Here. Here.
Take these and take the money.
But what about you?
I will come back around 7, plenty of time...
...to reach your bridge by sunset.
- What about you?
The three of us together are easy to spot.
See you later.
Gentlemen, I believe you are looking for me.
I am Julius Edmond Santorin.
- You're going to see him.
- Who?
Redford.
- Suppose the police come in here.
- Don't worry. I'm watching for them.
The blue-eyed one, that's Paul Newman?
Very good.
Now, again.
What did you do with the children?
I can't tell you that. Not yet.
When, then?
- What time is the sunset tonight?
- Sunset?
Yeah. What time?
- About 7:30.
- Can you hear the bells from here?
Of course.
Until they toll...
...I won't tell you...
...a thing.
Wake up, wake up! We're late.
- We'll never make it.
- We'll make it. Don't worry.
Wait, wait. This is the best part.
- Where's Julius?
- I don't know.
We can't wait for him.
We've gotta find a gondola. Come on.
We want a gondola.
- Bridge of Sighs, and step on it.
- 15,000 lira in advance.
- We've only got 12.
- 12,000. Take it or leave it.
- No. 15.
- Go to hell.
You go. You go.
- What are you doing?
- My father's a cabdriver.
- I know how to deal with these bastards.
- All right, come on. I take you.
But I won't sing.
Thank God for that.
Inspector Barloni?
Inspector Leclerc de la Sureté.
Nice to meet you.
This is Mr. King, Lauren's father.
Monsieur King...
May I present myself?
I'm Julius Edmond Santorin.
Mr. Santorin.
Your daughter...
...is a very lovely girl.
Where is she?
I'm sorry they hit you.
I'd like to talk to Mr. Santorin privately, if I may.
I assure you, Monsieur King...
...your daughter is safe...
...and well.
- What are you doing?
- There is the bridge.
- You've seen it. Now get out.
- You've got to take us under it.
This is as far as I go for 12,000 lira.
Damn it! It's just down there.
I don't understand.
If you assure me that she's safe and well, why can't you tell me where she is?
Where is Lauren?
At this moment, she is in a gondola...
...going under the Bridge of Sighs.
What for?
A kiss.
Michelle, darling, I'll take that.
You get the bag in the bedroom.
Michelle, would you get my brown leather bag...?
Gloves, upstairs in the bureau?
- Oh, my God!
- Get in the car, Kay.
- Do you see who's there?
- Get in the car.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.
Nice car.
We have a lot of luggage.
The furniture's going to be sent on later.
This is my address.
I'll write every day.
Well, probably not every day.
I don't want you getting sick of me.
It may be a while before we see each other again.
I know.
By then we'll be like everybody else.
We'll lose our lead.
I'll come to Paris with a bunch of college friends.
I don't want you to be like everybody else.
I don't want to be like everybody.
We are not now, and I hope we never will be.
We are different...
...and I am glad.
Lauren.
We will be exceptionally gifted and remain true to each other.
We'll remember every detail, everything that's happened since we met...
...okay?
Call me Bogie.
- I forgot what I said.
- You said, "Why?"
And I said:
"Because they belong together."
[ENGLISH]
[ Man ] You know, there's been a heap of legends and tall tales... about Robin Hood.
All different too.
Well, we folks of the animal kingdom have our own version.
It's the story of what really happened in Sherwood Forest.
[ Whistling ]
[ Imitates Trumpet ]
[ Scatting ]
[ Rooster Laughing ]
[ Whistling ]
[ Whistling, Imitating Trumpet ]
[ Whistling ]
Oh, incidentally,
I'm Allan-a-Dale, a minstrel.
That's an early-day folk singer.
And my job is to... tell it like it is.
Or was or whatever.
Robin Hood and Little John walkin' through the forest
Laughin' back and forth at what the other'n has to say
Reminiscin' this 'n' that and havin' such a good time
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water
They were drinkin'
They just guzzled it down
Never dreamin' that a schemin' sheriff and his posse
Was a-watchin' them and gatherin' around
Robin Hood and Little John runnin' through the forest
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees and tryin' to get away
Contemplatin' nothin' but escapin' and finally makin' it
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
You know something, Robin?
You're taking too many chances.
Chances?
You must be joking.
That was just a bit of a lark, Little John.
Yeah?
Take a look at your hat.
That's not a candle on a cake.
Hello. This one almost had my name on it, didn't it?
They're getting better, you know.
You've got to admit it.
They are getting better.
Huh, yeah. The next time that sheriff'll probably have a rope around our necks.
[ Gagging ] Pretty hard to laugh hangin' there, Rob.
Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse couldn't lift you off the ground.
- En garde!
- Hey, watch it, Rob.
That's the only hat I've got.
Oh, come along.
You worry too much, old boy.
You know something, Robin?
I was just wonderin'.
Are we good guys or bad guys?
You know. I mean, uh, our robbin' the rich to feed the poor.
"Rob"?
[ Clicking Tongue ]
That's a naughty word.
We never rob.
We just... sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.
Borrow? Huh.
Boy, are we in debt.
[ Trumpet Sounding ]
[ Chuckling ]
That sounds like another collection day for the poor. Eh, Johnny boy?
Yeah. Sweet charity.
Taxes!
[ Laughs ] Taxes!
Beautiful, lovely taxes!
[ Laughing ]
Sire, you have an absolute skill... for encouraging contributions from the poor. [ Chuckling ]
To coin a phrase, my dear counselor, rob the poor to feed the rich.
- [ Laughing ] Am I right?
- [ Laughing ]
Tell me, what is the next stop, Sir Hiss?
Uh, let me see.
Uh, I--
Oh! Yes.
The next stop is Nottingham, sire.
Oh! The richest plum of them all.
Notting--
[ Laughs ] ham.
A perfect fit, sire.
Most becoming.
You look regal, dignified, sincere, masterful, noble, chival--
Uh, uh, don't, don't overdo it, Hiss.
There. That,
I believe, does it.
This crown gives me a feeling of power! Power!
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.
[ Laughing ]
Power. Hmm.
And how well King Richard's crown sits on your noble brow.
Doesn't it?
Uh, King Richard?
I've told you never to mention my brother's name!
A-A mere slip of the forked tongue, Your Majesty.
We're in this plot together, if you don't mind my saying so.
And remember, it was your idea
I hypnotized him and--
I know. And sent him off on that crazy crusade.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ] Much to the sorrow of the Queen Mother.
Yes! Mother.
Mother always did like Richard best.
Your Highness, please don't do that.
If you don't mind my saying so, you see, you have a very loud thumb.
Hypnotism could rid you of your... psychosis... so... easily.
No! None of that!
None of that.
- Well, I was only trying to help.
- [ Laughs ]
I wonder.
Silly serpent.
- "Silly serpent"?
- Now look here.
One more hiss out of you,
[ Stammering ] Hiss, and you are walking to Nottingham.
Snakes don't walk.
They slither.
Hmpf. So there.
- [ Trumpeting ]
- [ Drumroll ]
Now what about that for luck?
It's only a circus. A peanut operation.
"Peanuts"? Why, you dunce.
That's the royal coach.
- It's Prince John himself.
- The prince?
Wait a minute.
There's a law against robbin' royalty.
- I'll catch you later.
- What?
And miss this chance to perform before royalty?
Ah! Here we go again.
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lally!
Fortune-tellers!
Fortunes forecast!
Lucky charms!
Get the dope with your horoscope.
Fortune-tellers! How droll.
Uh, stop the coach.
Sire, sire, they may be bandits.
Oh, poppycock.
Female bandits?
What next? Rubbish.
[ Chuckling ]
Um, um, my dear ladies, you have my permission to kiss the royal hands.
Whichever you like, first.
Mmm! Oh!
How gracious!
- And generous.
- [ Gasping ] Sire! Sire!
- Did you see what they--
- Stop! [ Laughing ]
Stop hissing in my ear.
- [ Stammering ]
- Ah! [ Laughs ]
Hiss! Oh, you've hissed your last--
- [ Gagging ]
- hiss.
[ Gulping ]
Suspicious snake.
Masterfully done,
Your Excellency.
[ Chuckling ]
Now close your eyes... and concentrate.
Close your eyes. Tight shut.
No peeking, sire.
[ Chuckling ]
From the mists of time, come forth, spirits.
Yoo-hoo!
Okay, little fireflies.
Glow, babies, glow.
[ Robin ]
We're waiting. [ Chuckling ]
Ah, oh!
Look, sire. Look!
Oh! Incredible.
Floating spirits.
Ah, oh!
[ Chuckling ]
Naughty, naughty.
You mustn't touch, young man.
Oh, how dare you strike the royal hand.
Shh! You'll break the spell.
Just gaze into the crystal ball.
Oo-de-lally!
Oo-de-lal-- Oh!
A face appears.
[ Gasping ]
- A crown is on his noble brow.
- Oo-de-lally!
A crown!
How exciting!
His face is handsome, regal, majestic, loveable, a cuddly face.
Handsome, regal, oh!
Majestic.
Loveable. Yes, yes.
Cuddly.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, that's me to a "T."
It really is. Yes.
- I-- [ Laughs ]
- Now what?
[ Gasps, Chuckles ]
I, uh--
I see, um, your illustrious name.
I know my name!
Get on with it!
Your name will go down, down, down, in history, of course.
Yes! I knew it!
I knew it!
Do you hear that, Hiss?
Oh, you-- [ Mumbling ]
He's in the basket.
Don--
Don't forget it.
Hmm.
What have we here?
Solid-gold hubcaps.
Oo-de-lally.
The jackpot.
[ Wolf Whistle ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Robbed! I've been robbed!
Hiss! You're never around when I need you!
- Ahem. I've been robbed.
- Of course you've been robbed!
[ Robin ]
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally!
Fortunes forecast.
Lucky charms.
After them, you fools!
[ Crying ]
No, no, no, no!
I knew it. I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.
I tried to warn you, but, no.
You wouldn't listen. You just had to--
Ah, ah, ah!
Seven years' bad--
Ooh! Luck.
That's what it is.
Besides, you broke your mother's mirror.
[ Wailing ]
Mommy!
I've got a dirty thumb.
[ Chuckling ]
Well, even though Prince John... offered a huge reward for the capture of Robin Hood, that elusive rogue kept right on robbin' the rich to feed the poor.
And believe me, it's a good thing he did,
'cause what with taxes and all, the poor folks of Nottingham were starvin' to death.
Uh-oh. Here comes old bad news himself, the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.
Every town
Has its taxes too
And the taxes is due
Do do-do do do
Well, lookie there.
[ Chuckles ]
Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.
He's out doin' good again.
- Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck.
- Shh, Otto.
Shh! For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, God bless Robin Hood.
Do do do do-do do dee do do-do
[ Friar Tuck ] It's the sheriff!
Hurry, hide it! Quick!
Here I come.
Ready or not.
Well, greetings from your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Oh, take it easy on me, Sheriff, w-what with this busted leg and all, you know.
I-I'm way behind in me work, Sheriff.
I know, Otto, but you're way behind with your taxes too.
Oh, have a heart, Sheriff.
Can't you see he's laid up?
Come on, Otto.
You'd better sit down and rest.
- [ Coins Jangling ]
- Oh, thank you. Yes.
Let me give you a hand with that leg.
Upsa-daisy.
Upsa-daisy. Bingo!
Ah, what they won't think of next.
[ Groaning ]
It smarts, don't it, Otto?
But Prince John says that taxes should hurt.
Now see here, you-- you evil, flint-hearted leech!
Now, now, now, now!
Save your sermon, preacher.
It ain't Sunday, you know.
[ Chuckles ]
Do do do-do do
They call me a slob, but I do my job
Do do do-do do
[ Children ]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Skippy
Happy birthday
To you
Well, now, sonny, that box is done up right pretty, ain't it?
Well, Mr. Sheriff, sir, it's my birthday present, sir.
It sure is.
Why don't you open it?
Oh, boy!
One whole farthing!
Have you no heart? We all scrimped and saved to give it to him.
Now that's mighty "thoughty" of you, "widder" woman.
The family that saves together pays together.
Oh, now, don't take it so hard, sonny.
Prince John wishes you a happy birthday too.
Alms, alms, alms for the poor.
Hmm. Well.
- [ Chuckles ]
- [ Gasps ]
Well, so far it's been a cheerful morning. Keep savin'!
What a dirty trick.
You poor old man.
[ Chuckles ]
Do come in.
Come in and rest yourself.
Thank ye kindly, Mother.
Thank ye.
Tell me now. Did me old ears hear someone singin' a birthday ditty?
[ Sniffling ]
Yes, sir.
And that mean old sheriff took my birthday present.
Did he now?
But be a stouthearted little lad, and don't let it get ya down.
Gee whiz!
It's Robin Hood!
Happy birthday, son!
Oh, he's so handsome, just like his reward posters.
Tell me, young man, how old are you today?
Gosh, I'm seven years old, goin' on eight.
Seven? Well, that does make you the man of the house, and I've got just the right present for you.
For me?
Gee, thanks,
Mr. Robin Hood, sir.
Hey, how do I look?
Huh?
Not much like Mr. Robin Hood.
She's right.
There is something missing.
[ Gasps ]
Of course!
There you go.
Boy, oh, boy.
Now how do I look?
[ Giggling ]
The hat's too big.
Shh!
Mind your manners.
Yes, mind your "mattles."
[ Chuckling ] Don't worry.
You'll grow into it, young man.
Oo-de-lally!
I'm gonna try it out.
Good-bye, Mr. Robin Hood!
Come again on my birthday!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, you have made his birthday a wonderful one.
How can I ever thank you?
I only wish
I could do more.
Here.
And keep your chin up.
Someday there'll be happiness again in Nottingham. You'll see.
Oh, Robin Hood.
You've risked so much to keep our hopes alive.
Bless you. Bless you.
Gee, did Robin Hood really give it to you?
Yeah, and this is his own hat too.
Gee, I'd sure like to shoot your bow and arrow.
- Let me try it, Skippy.
- Oh, no, you don't?
I'm gonna shoot it first.
You're pointin' it too high.
I'm not either.
Watch this.
Uh-oh.
Now you done it.
Right in
Prince John’s backyard.
Skippy, you can't go in there.
Yeah. Prince John will chop off your head.
Like this.
Oh, I don't care.
I gotta get my arrow.
[ Girl ] Wait a minute.
Toby might tattle on you.
- [ Skippy ] Yeah, Toby.
You gotta take the oath.
- An oath?
Put your hand on your heart and cross your eyes.
Spiders, snakes and a lizard head.
Spiders, snakes and a lizard's head.
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.
If I tattletale,
I'll die till I'm dead.
[ Women Giggling ]
- It's your turn to serve, Marian dear.
- Are you ready, Lady Kluck?
Oh, as your lady-in-waiting,
I'm waiting.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Klucky, that was a good shot.
You're not bad yourself, dear.
Oh, my girdle's killing me. [ Laughs ]
Where is it?
Did you lose it?
- It must be in there someplace.
- Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.
- [ Women Giggling ]
- Oh, look. There it is behind you.
Oh!
Well, hello.
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, please don't tell Prince John.
Mama said he'll chop off my head.
Oh, don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.
Oh, Marian, what a bonny wee bunny.
Who does this young archer remind you of?
Well, upon my word, the notorious Robin Hood.
That's right. Only Robin Hood wears a hat like that.
Yeah, and look at this keen
Robin Hood bow.
[ Sneezes ]
Oh, Marian, don't look around, but I do believe we're surrounded.
- Oh, mercy!
- He snitched on us.
It's all right, children.
Don't be afraid. Please come here.
- Do you think it's safe?
- That's Maid Marian.
Mama said she's awful nice.
Come on!
Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.
I told Skippy he was shooting too high.
I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.
- Gee, you're very beautiful.
- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?
Mama said you and Robin Hood are sweethearts.
Well, um--
[ Laughs ]
You see, that was several years ago before I left for London.
- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, uh, no.
But he carved our initials on this tree.
- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?
My mom gots a lot of kids.
Oh, he's probably forgotten all about me.
Oh, not Robin Hood.
I bet he'll storm the castle gates, fight the guards, rescue ya and drag you off to Sherwood Forest.
Now just a moment there, young man.
You've forgotten Prince John.
That old Prince John don't scare me none.
I'm scared of Prince John.
He's cranky.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
I, Prince John, challenge you to a duel. Hey, hey!
Take that! And that!
And this!
Death to tyrants!
Och! Och, och!
Slice him to pieces!
Oh, save me, my hero.
Save me.
- [ Skippy Giggling ]
- Oh! Ouch! That's not fair.
Mommy!
That's Prince John, all right.
[ Laughing ]
Yahoo!
Now I got ya!
Och, mercy! Mercy!
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
I'm dying.
- Oh!
- Did I hurt you? Huh?
No, this is the part where you drag your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.
Come on, lady fair!
Let's go!
Oh, Robin, you're so brave and impetuous.
Oh. [ Panting ]
So this is Sherwood Forest.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, now what are we gonna do?
Well, usually the hero gives his fair lady a kiss.
A kiss?
Oh, that's sissy stuff.
Well, if you won't, then I will.
[ Chuckling ]
- They're kissing! [ Giggling ]
- [ Laughing ]
[ Sighing ]
Ah, me. Young love.
Oh, it's a grand thing.
Oh, Klucky, surely he must know how much I still love him.
But, of course, my dear.
Believe me, someday soon, your uncle, King Richard, will have an outlaw for an in-law.
- [ Chuckling ]
- [ Chuckling ]
Oh, Klucky.
But when? When?
Oh, patience, my dear.
Patience.
Remember, absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Or forgetful.
Oh, I've been away so long.
What if he's forgotten all about me?
[ Humming ]
Hey, lover boy. How's that grub comin'? Man, I'm starved.
[ Continues Humming ]
Rob? Robin?
Robert?
- Hey!
- Hmm? What? What do you say?
Aw, forget it.
Your mind's not on food.
You're thinkin' about somebody with long eyelashes, and you're smellin' that sweet perfume.
[ Sniffing, Coughing ]
Hey, whoa!
It's boiling over!
You're burnin' the chow!
Sorry, Johnny. Guess I was thinking about Maid Marian again.
I can't help it.
I love her, Johnny.
Look, why don't you stop moonin' and mopin' around?
- Just-- Just marry the girl.
- Marry her?
You don't just walk up to a girl, hand her a bouquet and say,
"Hey, remember me? We were kids together. Will you marry me?"
[ Chuckling ]
No. It just isn't done that way.
Aw, come on, Robbie.
Climb the castle walls.
Sweep her off her feet.
Carry her off in style.
[ Sighing ] It's no use, Johnny.
I've thought it all out, and... it just wouldn't work.
Besides, what have I got to offer her?
Well, for one thing, you can't cook.
I'm serious, Johnny. She's a highborn lady of quality.
So she's got class?
So what?
I'm an outlaw, that's what.
That's no life for a lovely lady.
Always on the run.
- What kind of a future is that?
- Oh, for heaven's sake, son.
You're no outlaw.
Why, someday you'll be called a great hero.
A hero? Do you hear that, Johnny?
We've just been pardoned.
[ Laughs ] That's a gas.
We ain't even been arrested yet.
All right.
Laugh, you two rogues.
But there's gonna be a big to-do in Nottingham.
[ Slurping, Coughing ]
Well done, ain't it?
Old Prince John’s havin' a championship archery tournament tomorrow.
Archery tournament?
Ha!
Old Rob could win that standin' on his head, huh, Rob?
Thank you, Little John.
But I'm sure we're not invited.
No, but there's somebody... who'll be very disappointed if you don't come.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, old bushel britches, the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham.
- No, Maid Marian.
- Maid Marian?
Yeah. She-- She's gonna give a kiss to the winner.
- [ Laughing ]
- Kiss to the winner!
Oo-de-lally! Come on, Johnny!
What are we waiting for?
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That place will be crawlin' with soldiers.
Aha! But, remember.
Faint hearts never won fair lady.
Fear not, my friends.
This will be my greatest performance.
[ Trumpeting ]
[ Chuckling ]
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.
A coup d'etat, to coin a Norman phrase.
Oh, yes, indeed, sire.
Your plan to capture Robin Hood in public is sheer genius.
- [ Chuckling ]
- Hiss, no one sits higher than the king.
Must I remind you, Hiss?
[ Clicking Tongue ]
Oh, oh, forgive me, sire.
I-I didn't mean to--
My trap is baited and set... and then revenge!
Ah, revenge!
Shh! Not so loud, sire.
Remember, only you and I know, and your secret is my secret.
Stop! [ Laughs ]
Stop hissing in my ear.
- Secret? What secret?
- Why, the capture of Robin Hood, sire.
That insolent blackguard.
Ooh! I'll show him who wears the crown!
I share your loathing, sire.
That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you with that silly disguise, who dared to rob you and made you look so utterly ridiculous--
Enough!
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.
But-- B-But--
Sire, please.
Stop snivelling and hold still.
Thank you, sire.
Oh, Klucky,
I'm so excited.
But how will I recognize him?
Och, he'll let you know somehow.
That young rogue of yours is full of surprises, my dear.
There she is, Little John.
Isn't she beautiful?
Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's runnin' away with your head.
Oh, stop worrying.
This disguise would fool my own mother.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, but your mom ain't here.
You gotta fool old bushel britches.
- Sheriff? Your Honor?
- Yeah.
Meetin' ya face-to-face is a real treat.
A real treat.
Well, now, thank you.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, excuse me. I gotta go win this tournament.
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.
But wait till he sees this scene
I lay on Prince John.
Ah! Me lord.
My esteemed royal sovereign of the realm.
The head man himself.
You're beautiful.
[ Laughs ]
He has style, eh, Hiss?
[ Speaking French ]
[ Laughing ] You took the words right out of my mouth, P.J.
"P.J."! I like that.
Do you know I do?
Hiss, put it on my luggage.
P.J.
[ Laughing ]
P.J. Yes.
Hmpf!
And you?
Who might you be, sir?
I am Sir Reginald, duke of Chutney.
And don't stick your tongue out at me, kid.
And now, Your Mightiness, allow me to lay some protocol on you.
Oh, no. Uh, forgive me, but I lose more jewels that way than--
Please sit down.
Thanks, P.J. Couldn't get a better seat than this, could you?
The royal box.
Oh! Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
What's-- Oh, excuse me, buster.
"Buster"? You, sir, have taken my seat.
[ Laughing ]
Hiss, with you around, who needs a court jester?
[ Laughing ]
Now get out there and keep your snake eyes open for you know who.
You-- You mean, I--
I'm being dismissed?
You heard His Mightiness.
Move it, creepy.
Get lost.
Begone, long one.
What cheek! "Creepy"?
"Buster"? "Long one"?
Who does that dopey duke think he is?
- Now he's up to somethin', Friar.
- Yeah! Come on!
[ Trumpeting ]
Ah, Your Ladyship.
Beggin' your pardon, but it's a great honor... to be shootin' for the favor of a lovely lady like yourself.
I hopes I win the kiss.
Oh!
Well, thank you, my thin-legged archer.
[ Chuckling ]
I wish you luck,
[ Whispering ] with all my heart.
I wonder.
Your Highness, with your royal permission, we are ready to begin.
Proceed, Captain!
The tournament of the golden arrow will now begin.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Trumpeting ]
[ Cheering ]
[ Whistles ]
Yea, Dad!
[ Crowd Booing ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
A perfect bull's-eye.
- Well, well.
- [ Laughs ] Yeah.
That's what you call pullin' it back and lettin' it go, P.J.
I'm gonna win that golden arrow, and then I'm gonna present meself to the lovely Maid Marian and--
Listen, scissorbill, if you shoot... half as good as you blabbermouth, you're better'n Robin Hood.
Robin Hood, he says!
Wowee!
I'm tiptop, all right, but I'm not as good as he is.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
That kid's got class, ain't he, P.J.?
Indeed he has, Reggie.
[ Laughs ]
Bravo! Uh, bravo! Yes.
Oh, um, by the way.
I hear you're havin' a bit of trouble gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood.
He's scared of me, that's what he is.
You notice he didn't show up here today.
Huh! I could spot him through them phony disguises.
It's him!
It's Robin Hood!
[ Laughs ] I just can't wait till I tell His Majesty.
[ Giggling ]
Unhand me, you--
[ Grunts ]
Please, please!
I don't drink!
Attention, everyone.
The final contestants are... the Honorable
Sheriff of Nottingham...
[ Crowd Booing ] and the spindle-legged stork from Devonshire.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
My dear, I suspect you favor the gangly youth, hmm?
Uh, why, yes, sire.
Well, at least he amuses me.
[ Laughs ]
Coincidently, my dear young lady, he amuses me too.
[ Laughing ]
For the final shoot-out, move the target back
30 paces.
You heard him, Nutsy!
Get goin'!
Move it, you birdbrain.
And remember what you're supposed to do.
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.
[ Crowd Booing ]
[ Chuckling ] Well, that shot wins the golden arrow, the kiss and the whole caboodle.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Crowd Gasping ]
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Yea! He did it, he did it, he did it!
[ Whispering ]
Archer, I commend you, and because of... your superior skill, you shall get what is coming to you.
Our royal congratulations.
Oh, thank you kindly,
Your Highness.
Meetin' you face-to-face,
Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.
Release the royal fingers.
Ah!
And now I name you... the winner, or, more appropriately,
[ Laughs ] the loser!
Seize him.
I sentence you to sudden, instant and even... immediate death!
[ Gasps ]
Oh, no! Oh!
Please.
Please, sire.
I beg of you to spare his life.
Please have mercy.
My dear emotional lady, why should I?
Because I love him,
Your Highness.
"Love him"?
And does this prisoner return your love?
Marian, my darling, I love you more than life itself.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, young love.
Your pleas have not fallen upon a heart of stone.
But traitors to the Crown must die!
Traitor to the Crown?
That crown belongs to King Richard.
- Long live King Richard!
- [ Crowd ] Long live King Richard!
Enough! I am king!
King! King!
Ah! Off with his head!
[ Sniffling ]
Oh, no!
Stop! Executioner, stop!
Hold your ax!
Okay, big shot. Now tell them to untie my buddy, or I'll--
[ Grunts ]
Sheriff, release my buddy--
[ Grunts ]
I mean, release the prisoner!
Untie the prisoner?
You heard what he said, bushel britches.
Sheriff, I make the rules, and since I am the head man--
Not so hard, you mean thing.
Let him go, for heaven's sakes!
Let him go!
Yee-hee!
Love conquers all!
[ Cheering ]
I owe my life to you, my darling.
I couldn't have lived without you, Robin.
There's somethin' funny goin' on around here.
Now, P.J., tell my pal to kiss Maid Marian, or I've just found a new pincushion.
Why, you!
Kill him!
Don't stand there! Kill him!
Don't hurt me! No, no!
Don't hurt me! Help! Help!
Kill him!
Run for it, lassie!
This is no place for a lady!
[ Screaming ]
Take that, you scoundrel.
Help! Robin, help!
Marian, my love, will you marry me?
Oh, darling, I thought you'd never ask me.
But you could have chosen a more romantic setting.
- And for our honeymoon, London--
- Yes!
- Normandy! Sunny Spain!
- Yes! Why not?
Ooh, what a main event this is.
- [ John Laughing ]
- [ Lady Kluck Shouting ]
What a beautiful brawl.
Hey! Who's drivin' this flyin' umbrella?
- We'll have six children.
- Six?
Oh, a dozen at least.
[ Chuckling ]
Take that!
Attention, everyone.
[ Horn Blaring ]
[ Trumpeting ]
Stop the girl!
- Ooh!
- Take that, you scurvy knave!
Seize the fat one!
- [ Whistles ]
- [ Cheering ]
Yahoo!
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Long live King Richard!
Yee-hoo!
Hiss! You're never around when I need you!
[ Echoing ] Coming. Coming.
[ Laughs ]
For I'm a jolly good fellow
For I'm a jolly good--
[ Laughs ]
Oh! Oh, there you are, old boy!
P.J., you won't believe this, but the stork is really Robin Hood.
Robin Hood.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Screaming ]
Get out of that if you can.
[ Woman ]
Love It seems like only yesterday
You were just a child at play
Now you're all grown up
Inside of me
Oh, how fast those moments flee
Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief
But when it's gone
Love goes on and on
[ Harmonizing ]
Love will live
Love will last
Love goes on
And on and on
Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief
But when it's gone
Love goes on and on
Oh, Robin, what a beautiful night.
I wish it would never end.
[ Friar Tuck ]
Surprise!
- Long live Robin Hood!
- [ Sexton ] Hooray!
- And long live Maid Marian!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Hear, hear! Bravo! Bravo!
Hooray!
And down with that scurvy Prince John!
Yeah.
Oh, the world will sing of an English king a thousand years from now
And not because he passed some laws or had that lofty brow
While bonny good King Richard leads the great crusade he's on
We'll all have to slave away for that good-for-nothin' John
Incredible as he is inept
Whenever the history books are kept
They'll call him the phony king of England
A pox on that phony king of England
[ Friar Tuck Laughing ]
[ All Laughing ]
He sits alone on the giant throne pretendin' he's the king
A little tyke who's rather like a puppet on a string
And he throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way
And then he calls for Mom while he's suckin' his thumb.
You see, he doesn't wanna play.
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
Apox on that phony king of England
Lay that country on me babe
Come on, Johnny.
Go, laddie, go!
Oh, oh, oooh!
While he taxes us to pieces and he robs us of our bread
King Richard's crown keeps slippin' down around that pointed head
Ah, but while there is a merry man in Robin's wily pack
We'll find a way to make him pay and steal our money back
A minute before he knows we're there
- [ Stops ]
- Old Rob'll snatch his underwear.
- [ All Laughing ]
- [ Resumes ]
The breezy and uneasy king of England
The snivelin', grovelin'
Measly, weaselly
Blabberin', jabberin'
Jibberin', jabberin'
Plunderin', plottin'
Wheelin', dealin'
Prince John
That phony king of England
Yeah
He throws an angry tantrum if he cannot have his way
He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb and doesn't want to play
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
How about that?
That's P.J. to a "T." Let me try.
Let me try. [ Clears Throat ]
[ Warming Up ]
Too late to be known as John the First
He's sure to be known as John the Worst
The fabulous, marvelous, merciful, chivalrous--
Oh, you got it all wrong, Hiss.
- The snivelin', grovelin', weaselly, measly--
- Enough!
But-But, sire, it's a big hit.
The whole village is singin' it.
Oh, they are, are they?
Well, they'll be singing a different tune.
Double the taxes!
Triple the taxes!
Squeeze every last drop... out of those insolent, musical peasants!
[ Allan-a-Dale ]
Man, oh, man.
- Prince John sure made good his threat,
- [ Thunderclap ] and his helpless subjects paid dearly... for his humiliation, believe me.
Taxes, taxes, taxes.
Why, he taxed the heart and soul out of the poor people of Nottingham.
- [ Guitar ]
- And if you couldn't pay your taxes, you went to jail.
Yep, I'm in here too.
Nottingham was in deep trouble.
Every town
Has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham
I'm inclined to believe
If we weren't so down
We'd up and leave
We'd up and fly
If we had wings for flyin'
Can't you see the tears we're cryin'
Can't there be some happiness
For me
Not in Nottingham
Friar Tuck, [ Sighs ]
I don't think anyone is coming.
You're right, Sexton, but maybe the sound of this church bell... will bring those poor people some comfort.
We must do what we can to keep their hopes alive.
Oh, how can there be any hope with that tyrant Prince John... taxing the heart and soul out of the poor people?
Yes, those poor people.
Look, our poor box is like our church-- empty.
Friar Tuck, we've saved this.
It's not much, but please take it for the poor.
Your last farthing?
Aw, little sister, no one can give more than that.
Bless you both.
Oh, we were just saving it for a rainy day.
Well, it's rainin' now.
- [ Chuckles ] Things can't get worse.
- [ Sheriff ] Howdy, Friar.
- Well, it looks like
I dropped by just in time.
- [ Organ Stops ]
- What does that big-bellied bully want?
- Father, shh.
Hmm. Well, what have we got here?
Now, just a minute,
Sheriff!
Th- Th- That's the poor box!
It sure is, and I'll just take it for poor Prince John.
Every little bit helps.
Oooh, you put that back!
And His Majesty also blesses you, little sister.
You thievin' scoundrel!
Now, take it easy, Friar.
I'm just doin' my duty.
Collectin' taxes for that arrogant, greedy, ruthless, no-good Prince John?
Listen, Friar, you're mighty preachy, and you're gonna preach your neck right into a hangman's noose.
Get out of my church!
- Out! Out! Out! Out!
- Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Oh, dear me.
You want taxes?
- I'll give you taxes!
- Ow!
Give it to him! Give it to him!
Give it to him, Friar!
You're under arrest for high treason to the crown.
Oh, no!
Oh, there, there, Mother.
[ Allan-a-Dale ]
Every town
Has its ups and downs
Sometimes ups
Outnumber the downs
But not in Nottingham
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Sire, if I may-- may venture an opinion, you're not your usual cheerful, genial self today.
I-I-I know. I know.
You haven't counted your money for days, hmm?
It always makes you so happy.
[ Clears Throat ]
Sire, taxes are pouring in, the jail is full.
And, oh,
I have good news, sire.
- Friar Tuck is in jail.
- Friar Tuck?
It's Robin Hood I want, you idiot!
I'd give all my gold if I could just get my hands--
Did you say Friar Tuck?
Did I?
Y-Y-Yes, I did.
Ah!
Hiss, I have it!
I'll use that fat friar as bait to trap Robin Hood.
Another trap?
Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.
Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows in the village square, don't you see?
B-B-But, sire, hang Friar Tuck, a man of the church?
Yes, my reluctant reptile.
And when our elusive hero tries to rescue... the corpulent cleric,
[ Laughing ] my men will be ready.
[ Thunderclap ]
Well, Trigger, everything's rigged up and all set.
Yep, it's one of the prettiest scaffolds you ever built, Sheriff.
Sheriff, don't you reckon we oughta give that there trapdoor a test?
[ Groans ]
Criminently. Now I know why your mama called you "Nutsy."
Alms. Alms for the poor.
Do me old ears hear the melodious voice... of the sheriff?
That's right, old man.
What be going on here?
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.
No! Hang Friar--
Hang Friar Tuck?
You betcha. At dawn.
And maybe it'll even be a double hangin'.
Shh, shh.
Dummy up, you dummy.
A double hangin', eh?
Who'll be the other one who gets the rope?
Sheriff, he's gettin' too all-fired nosy.
Oh, I didn't mean nothin'.
But, um, couldn't there be trouble... if Robin Hood showed up?
Well, wouldn't you know,
Sheriff, he guessed it.
Nutsy, button your beak.
Ah, no need to worry.
The sheriff be too crafty, too clever and too smart... for the likes of him, says I.
[ Sheriff ]
Ya hear that, Nutsy?
For bein' blind, he sure knows a good man... when he sees one, says I.
Sheriff,
I still got a feelin'... that that snoopy old codger knows too much.
Oh, shut up, Trigger.
He's just a harmless old blind beggar.
Alms.
Alms for the poor.
Alms.
Alms for the poor.
Rob, we can't let 'em hang Friar Tuck.
A jailbreak tonight is the only chance he's got.
A jailbreak? There ain't no way you can get him.
We've got to, Johnny, or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.
1:00, and all's well!
[ Clock Chiming Three Times ]
[ Snorts, Smacking Gums ]
Nutsy, you'd better set your brains ahead a couple of hours.
Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean addin' or subtractin'?
- Oh, let's forget it.
- Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.
Nutsy, how can I sleep with you yelling
"All's well" all the time here?
Sheriff, everything ain't "all's well."
I got a feelin' in my bones there's gonna be a jailbreak any minute.
Criminently, Trigger!
Point that peashooter the other way.
Don't you worry none, Sheriff.
The safety's on Old Betsy.
What in tarnation you tryin' to do,
- you birdbrain?
- Just doin' my duty, Sheriff.
You and that itchy trigger finger of yours.
[ Muffled Scream ]
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Sure did, Trigger.
There's something funny going on around here. Come on.
You cover me.
Wait a minute.
Is the safety on Old Betsy?
- You bet it is, Sheriff.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
You go first.
All right, you in there, come out with your hands up.
Yeah, reach for the sky.
- Just you watch this
"preformance", partner.
- Be careful, Rob.
Jehoshaphat, Trigger.
Put that peashooter down.
Aw, shucks, Trigger, it's only Nutsy.
And criminently, get back to your patrol.
- On the double. Get!
- I'm a-gettin'.
That Trigger.
He's gettin' everybody edgy.
Nothing's gonna happen.
That fat friar... is gonna dangle from the gallows come daybreak.
Sheriff, why don't you just sit yourself down here kind of cozy-like?
Well, thank you, Nutsy.
Just close your sleepy little eyeballs.
The sandman's a-comin'.
[ Snoring ]
Why don't you, uh, let me loosen that belt?
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff
Just you relax
[ Snoring ]
- [ Humming ]
- [ Humming Along ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
- [ Humming ]
- [ Clicks ]
[ Snorts ]
Oh, Nutsy, that's mighty sweet.
Sing it one more time, would you?
Rock-a-bye, Sheriff
Just you relax
[ Humming ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
Wait a minute!
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!
I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff!
The door! The door!
- Now, for the last time, no more false alarms.
- Ow!
Now, you release Friar Tuck and the others... and I'll drop in on the royal treasury.
Oh, Little John, it can't be!
- Shh, quiet. We're bustin' out of here.
- Thank God.
My prayers have been answered.
- I'm ready. Where's the bad guys?
- Take it easy, son.
- [ Prince John Snoring ]
- [ Hiss Hissing ]
[ Prince John ]
Robin Hood!
[ Laughing ]
I'll get even. I'll get--
[ Prince John Sighing ]
[ Snorts, Grumbles ]
[ Snoring ]
[ High-Pitched Moaning ]
[ High-Pitched Moaning ]
[ Snoring ]
It's Robin Hood I--
I want.
[ Laughing Continues ]
[ Muttering ]
[ Laughing ]
Praise the Lord and pass the tax rebate!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Come on. Follow me.
Now, Sheriff--
Now, don't get your dander up, but I still got a feelin' that--
Friar, get goin'.
Hurry.
[ Clock Chiming Four Times ]
[ Moans ]
[ Snorts, Mutters ]
[ Shuddering ]
[ Whimpering ]
[ Screaming ]
Ooo-oooh!
Guards! Guards!
My gold!
Oh, no, no, no.
They're getting away with my gold.
Guards! Guards!
To the jail!
Rhinos, halt!
Stop! Desist!
[ Screaming ]
Everybody, this way!
That's all of them.
Get going.
This ain't no hayride.
Let's move it out of here. Ho-ooo!
On to Sherwood Forest!
Stop! My baby!
Mama, Mama, wait for me.
- We got him now!
- Keep going. Don't worry about me.
This time, we got him for sure.
Shoot him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Come on, Rob. Come on.
He's just gotta make it.
No! No. No.
Hiss, he's finished!
Done for!
La, la, la
[ Laughing ]
He's gonna make it, isn't he, Little John?
Hey, what's that?
Little John, look it!
Look it!
Hey, what the--
[ Laughs ]
Oh, man, did you have me worried, Rob.
I thought you were long gone.
Ah, not Robin Hood.
He could've swum twice that far, huh, Mr. Robin Hood, sir?
Look, Friar! Look!
He's made it. He got away again.
A pox on that phony King of England!
Oo-de-lally!
- Oo-de-lally!
- Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.
Well, I tried to tell you, but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.
Your traps never work, and look what you've done to your mother's castle.
[ Screaming ]
Mommy!
- [ Screams ] Sire, no!
- You cowardly cobra!
Please! Oh, no!
Procrastinating python!
- Aggravating asp!
- Save me!
You eel in snake's clothing!
Help!
He's gone stark raving mad!
[ Echoing ]
[ Whistling ]
You know, I thought we'd never get rid of those two rascals, but lucky for us folks,
King Richard returned, and, well, he just straightened everything out.
[ Whimpering ]
Oooh. Aaah.
[ Church Bells Chiming ]
Say, we'd better get over to the church.
Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.
[ All ]
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live King Richard!
Oh, Friar Tuck, it appears that I now have an outlaw for an in-law.
Yes, not bad.
Gee, Skippy, how come you're goin'?
Well, Robin Hood's gonna have kids, so somebody's gotta keep their eye on things.
Ho-ooo!
Ohhh.
I've never been so happy.
Hey, here come the bride,
Trigger.
Present arms!
[ Allan-a-Dale Chuckles ] Well, folks, that's the way it really happened.
Love goes on and on
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
Oo-de-lally, Oo-de-lally
Golly, what a day
There, that's good.
Luckily we've got ace photographer
Angus Snapforth to do our credits.
He works longitudinally... developing his negatives in Turkish-bath cabinet.
So this should be just the job for him.
And he has promised to make it snappy.
37 miles to the north, a bit east, and then up a bit lies Pinchcliff.
A village perched under the blue welkin... with it's own steam-driven cheese factory, a camping site, a local paper... and it's own TV station.
Open to all the winds that blow, where the sun rises above Lonetree Hill... lives our cycle-repairer,
Theodore Rimspoke.
Must be awkward for a wretched cyclist with a blow-out... to have to wheel his mount all this way to get our expert to fix it.
Doesn't look as if business is very thriving, does it?
It's only our postman, old foot-slogging
Dan Hoofer, who makes his way there... with the local rag and outstanding bills. His greatcoat has diamond tread.
He's colour blind and has been run over a couple of times... walks with a list to port and plays the big bass on festive occasions.
Not much more to sa y about Hoofer.
Cycle-repairer Rimspoke is an independent sort of bloke.
More of an inventor than a businessman.
Famous for his ingenious designs... such as pedal-activated combined shaving and raspberry-picking machine.
He uses a copying pencil, instant coffee and his own patent telescopic ruler.
Sonny Duckworth is the early bird personified.
Hatched out in a weeping willow. A born optimist...
- with muffler, felt slippers and indifferent morals. As Sonny puts it:
The early worm gets the bird.
Difficulties he treats as trifles, the impossible as a challenge.
He's Rimspoke's right-hand man, counsellor, and friend.
Lambert is a night-owl with ha y-fever, a pillar of the rustic establishment.
Run over by a reaper and got a crew-cut, short back, bushy by the ears.
Found under the roots of a knotted oak and included as a Rimspoke resident.
Lambert is a personal pessimist, and only really at home in Darkest Devon.
And this is their home, standing in its own pleasant grounds... enjoying all the benefits of
Rimspoke's ingenious gadgets.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Hi, Theodore! Look at this.
This morning's post.
Nothing but bills. Put them on the window sill with the others.
Take a look at that super car!
Look at that there Rudolph Gore-Slimey!
- Do you know that fellow?
- Know him?
- Yes, I'll say I know him.
- Do you know him personal?
That there Rudolph, he was a kind of apprentice to me in my workshop.
Then he suddenly packed it in and went to town.
And now he's in big business, and a racing driver, I see.
You don't sa y...? Big business, too?
Beats me how that there Gore-Slimey... got into the racing circuit?
Competing with the best in the world, it says.
Look! Smashing picture on the back too.
Well, I never...!
I might have guessed as much.
Guessed? Guessed what?
I wonder what he's got under his bonnet?
So that's why Gore-Slimey was in such a hurry to go to town, huh?
There's some skulduggery going on here.
- More trouble brewing, I'll wager...
- No, no, Lambert.
Say, Theodore, what's skulduggery?
Yeh, what's skulduggery?
Well, we better get down to some honest work.
Out with you, and set to work!
When the call to work goes out,
Brother, please include me out!
Put your hat and coat on, Lambert!
Come on!
I see, doing your daily dozen, Lambert?
I say, what's skulduggery, Sonny?
Skulduggery?
That is skulduggery!
Oh.
The north wind's blowing from every quarter today, Sonny?
Lovely weather for working.
I'm scared, I am.
I don't like it when it's blowing from every quarter.
- Let's get this contraption working!
- All, right, just leave it to me.
Computerised production of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy!
That'll be 10, 75.
Theodore is self-supporting, has his own electric power, water laid on... and turns an honest penny on the side.
Lambert remains a true romantic.
Despite his chronic hay fever
Lambert is conspicuously on parade... whenever the sun shines down at Pinchcliffe.
You'd hardly say life at Rimspoke's is one mad rush, but now and again... a buckled wheel or a bent handlebar needs attention.
The profits are hardly likely to cause repercussions on the money market... still the three of them up the hill are content enough.
Don't be frightened, Lambert.
I'll switch the TV on, Theodore.
- I don't like TV.
- There's no bogeyman in the box.
You never can tell, can you.
And now for the news, read by
pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
This is usually pretty exciting.
The situation is still
very tense in the Middle East.
Here...
- Dang me sideways!
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
And now after the news,
the World of Sport.
We deserve a little extra treat tonight.
I expect you'd like some dewrinkled raisins, Sonny?
Help yourself, there's plenty for everyone.
The current Motor Racing
sensation, Rudolph Gore-Slimey.
After winning his third successive
Grand Prix. A few words, please.
I came of humble stock from
the little village of Pinchcliffe.
Worked for a while in a cycle repair
shop run by an eccentric rustic.
Forget his name... Theodore...
Theodore Rimspoke, I think it was.
- Just hark at him... I mean to sa y...
- Quiet now, Sonny!
Humble beginnings, eh?
Funny to think how easy it can be
to get stuck in a rut like that place.
But there was no stopping you?
No, and I think my latest invention
will revolutionise motor racing!
- What invention?
- This super retometric distributor.
It raises the jet-injection factor to
1000 and the corradial effect by 112%.
So that's your game! So that's your invention, is it, Rudolph?
Funny, because here's the working drawing!
What did you sa y? Has Gore-Slimey gone and swiped your invention?
Yes, he must have collared it when he was working here as my assistant.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop. I never heard the like!
I sa y, please, could you pass me another liquorice allsorts?
Hush! We must listen to what Gore-Slimey has to sa y.
Let me repeat, I'm prepared anytime,
anywhere, to meet any challenge.
Thank you for talking to us.
We hope we shall soon see
someone putting up a challenge.
Now the Chairman, District Veterinary
Surgeon Roger Uddersfield...
will present today's commercials.
For guaranteed social success, use
Brough, the swift-action hair tonic.
- Switch off that commercial nonsense!
- Remember the name, Brough!
Recommended by egg-heads!
- Don't let them fool you, Theodore!
- Well, what's a bloke to do now?
You're going to challenge!
No, no, that'd be dangerous.
- You pipe down, Lambert!
- Challenge him?
I do have a little secret tucked away in the coach-house. Might be fun...
Have a go! Could you get this completed, Gore-Slimey wouldn't need... any driving-mirror!
Just imagine II Tempo Gigante!
Rimspoke's reply to the Italian Ferrari!
- Out of the way, macadamised snail!
- Save your felt-slippers, Sonny.
Well, shall we take a peep inside the coach-house and see what we've got?
- Yes, let's!
- Oh, no.
There isn't much I can do with this thing here.
It's in a sorrier state than I suspected.
- You could soon fix this up.
- Can't build a car without a penny.
I haven't even got the nuts and bolts.
We'll have to make a real killing!
You could raise the wind, could you?
A divinity shapes our ends.
Stick'em up!
- Hand it over!
- Do you suppose I've got any money?
This bloke's a poor as a church mouse!
- This won't solve our problems.
- Well, blow me. I'll be...
Well, blow me. I'll be...
That really hurt.
Never felt such a pain before.
Wouldn't never ever have thought it possible.
- Move over!
- Can't I have the inside berth tonight?
- Don't we all have our places?
- I never get the inside berth.
- There's such a draft off the floor.
- That's why I take the inside berth.
Come on, pipe down!
Well, good night to you, Sonny.
Sleep well.
Nighty!
Sonny!
Sonny!
I sa y, Theodore? Has he gone out?
I wonder why?
Theodore's feeling a bit down in the dumps.
I wonder if it is because he hasn't got enough money to build the car, Sonny?
Think you'll be able to help him out, eh, Sonny?
Lambert, it's only a matter of time... before Sonny Duckworth of Sludgemere strikes again!
I think I'll just stretch my carcase a bit more.
Oi! String me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Rolls-Royce 1905 model! Solid gold.
Acetylene lamps.
Gosh, transverse interleaved suspension. Silicon finish...
What sort of a spooky get-up is that?
He must be oozing with dough!
Gosh! He's using dollar bills as fly-whisks!
"Aladdin Oil"!
He must be one of those oil sheiks!
Perhaps we could funnel a little in Theodore's direction...
Snickety snoo!
How too, too snickety snoo.
If this isn't tempting providence,
I'd like to know what is.
An ape, honestly. A genuine cross between a chimp and a gorilla.
This is no joking matter!
There should be plenty of money here for Theodore's new design.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Talk about an Oriental chick!
And that fierce-looking money-grubber!
Desperados!
What eez the bizniz going on here?
And the papyrus here?
Theez eez no hieroglyphics.
Theeze eez drawing of fast motor-car.
Sensation!
Theez car work of great genius.
Where is the deesigner?
Ali, ali, Emanuel Desperados, you fetch me theez genius!
Thrown out? Not possibull!
Throw out of the tent of
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza?
Idiot!
You stupid gorilla dam blockhead.
Sonny's not the type to give up easily!
At a pinch he gets his fertile brain... work overtime and changes his line of attack.
Once his mind's made up, there's no stopping Sonny.
Ah, yes, the Pinchcliffe Gazette.
That's an idea all right.
An ad inserted here will have world wide coverage!
My Spanish gambit eez successful!
And it's Desperados to move.
Your check easy to overcome.
I just go through weez my castle.
That shake you, eh?
You theenk you vairy smart, no?

Emanuel Desperados.
Zees car ingenious!
You!
Throw designer out of my tent. Idiot!
You beeg blockhead!
Stoopid gorilla...
So you're up early for once, Lambert?
Yeh, gotta spend a penny.
- Perhaps you could fetch the paper?
- Yeh, I'll do that for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a sensational announcement...
of the new racing car now under
construction by Theodore Rimspoke.
Pinchcliffe radio and
Television roving reporter...
pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank,
has all the details.
Your on the air, Archie!
It's all yours!
- You're on the air.
- Thank you.
My, you people are inquisitive!
We have it on the best of authority...
that cycle-repairer
Theodore Rimspoke...
resident of Pinchcliffe, plans to
complete his II Tempo Gigante.
Aha! There's the sooper-dooper car.
What an advertisement for Aladdin Oil!
Me finance Rimspoke and we win race!
Emanuel Desperados, you drive me!
We go visit genius!
Emanuel, geev me completed contract!

Hurry! Turn starting-handle!
Bravo!
Close zee door and get cracking!
Hurry! We late!
Now change gear!
Caramba!
Put her in reverse... there you idiot.
Snitchery snoo!
This is tempting providence putting all this in print.
Theodore, it says in the paper.
But where the dickens is it?
- Theodore, the paper!
- What does it say in the paper?
It's all about your car.
What? Let's have a look!
Well, what do you know!
II Tempo Gigante? It's our car!
How did that old picture get into print?
Speed it up!
Dangerous suspension bridge. Hurry!
Speed it up!
"Rimspoke has accepted
Gore-Slimey's challenge."
"Prospects for the
Race of the Century."
I wonder who's gone and...?
So, that's it. Sonny has been at work.
Yeh, Sonny has been at work.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!
- What've you been up to now, Sonny?
- What've you been up to now, Sonny?
- Just a few casual acquaintances.
- Sonny's casual acquaintances, eh?
They're apt to be a bit suspect.
- I believe we've got something outside.
- Sounds like it.
Ze silence here is as profound as in ze desert. All people inside ze house.
Emanuel, go knock up ze door!
Would you open the door, Lambert?
Someone's lost his way and landed here.
Hurry along, Lambert, you like receiving visitors, I know.
Lambert, man, don't be scared just because the door creaks a bit.
Look at Sonny!
Cool as a prize cucumber.
- Give them a nice welcome, Lambert.
- Yes, I certainly will.
- Oh, gosh!
- Salaam, salaam!
May Allah protect thee and thy house.
I have journeyed from afar to have a good squint at Rimspoke.
Have no fear, friend! My chauffeur not dangerous, just a bit inquisitive.
Very, very inquisitive!
What sort of a jungle denizen might this be?
Must have been smuggled in in a crate of bananas.
You ze great bicycle-repairer Rimspoke?
Yes, that's supposed to be me.
Just step right inside.
Brew up a pot of coffee, Lambert.
Ah, you verry kind. We come to have pow-wow and you must listen to me.
You Rimspoke brilliant designer.
I Abdul Ben Bonanza have seen TV.
I will finance your Tempo Gigante.
I plenty moneys. You plenty broke.
Well, maybe, but what do you want me to do?
You use my oil and petrol.
Z e best in ze whole world.
She'll run on my own patent mixture.
It would be fun to give it a try.
Then pleez you sign theez contract.
No, no, that's dangerous.
- Do you think so, Lambert?
- Of course you'll sign, Theodore.
The offer of a century, from friends in distant lands!
- Yes, pleez sign!
- You're on dangerous ground.
Don't listen to that Jeremiah.
It's the chance of a lifetime.
Well, it might well be.
Bravo! So now pleez sign contract.
We're heading straight for disaster. I know it.
It's amazing what you can do with money!
And a string of oil wells to back you up.
Damn me if Theodore, the bird... and our ungainly furry friend with the rucksack haven't really go cracking!
Nuts and bolts, sprockets and spindles.
Skilled hands engaged in precision lathe-work... on rotary hydrogenic valves.
With one vigilant eye cocked on the doings of willing helpers... who run unnecessary risks without the protection of safety footwear.
Work proceeds da y and night.
Mysterious fluids seethe and bubble in carboys, copper tubes and on hotplates.
Theodore is experimenting with all kinds of fuel... and hand-made thinly rolled body panels.
Behind dark goggles Theodore is concocting a motorised carriage... that is going to prove a sensation in the motor-racing world... with technical finesses which entail radical innovations in the carburetion!
Straight down the lightning conductor!
Theodore has taken proper precautions... against natural catastrophes and unforeseen punctures.
Il Tempo Gigante features special tyres, with steel reinforcement.
And seven layers of chicken netting welded into West Indian rubber alloys.
When Theodore builds an engine, he doesn't settle for a mere two-stroke.
He has drilled 12 cylinders and fitted them with concave linings... rammed in a whole heap of high-tension ignition plugs... linked to three-inch hyper-polished exhaust manuals.
The finished product weighing 2.8 tons... is impressive enough to shake any major motor factory to its foundation.
It takes a full year to knock out a vehicle like II Tempo Gigante.
The day Theodore completed the prototype... the Bristol seismograph registered
7,8 on the Richter scale.
Not a bad start for a do-it-yourself village enthusiast.
Here's the late news.
It has been confirmed that II Tempo
Gigante is ready for its supreme test.
People in Pinchcliffe
are confident that Rimspoke...
can show Gore-Slimey
a clean pair of heels.
We shall see when the chips are down.
Time will show!
Hi, you'll frighten them out of their wits!
Sonny! Sonny!
Who is it? Where is he?
I can hear something real horrible.
There must be someone outside snooping around.
Theodore, there's someone snooping around at the dead of night.
I bet it's someone after your car.
I think we should hide in the cellar.
What? In the cellar?
- Night-time intruders?
- Yes, I think there are people about.
Our burglar alarm should deal with car thieves, and it's all set up.
You go to the right, Sonny, on the other side of the coach-house... and I'll go this side.
- And you keep an eye on the door.
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
I never been so scared.
Never thought I would ever be so scared.
Hush, someone's coming!
That's Mister Gore-Slimey in the bag all right.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Gracious...
So it's you strung up and dangling there, Lambert?
I walked slap into it!
That rope was intended for Rudolph, so you'll have to forgive me, Lambert.
That put the skids on old Gore-Slimey.
Sir Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
We are gathered together to unveil
Rimspoke's technical masterpiece... which in tomorrows Grand Prix will challenge the world's racing drivers... including Rudolph Gore-Slimey in his 12-cylinder Boomerang Rapido.
We're gratified to have TV coverage today... in black and white and in choice colours.
This event is being transmitted
via the Pinchcliffe TV control panel... designed by Theodore Rimspoke and broadcast nationwide... full stop.
To mark this auspicious occasion we have invited one of our greatest brads.
Despite an attack of the sniffles and the handicap of a mane of unruly air... composed a laudatory epic:
Hanbury Dapplenag!
Greetings, mighty son of the desert waste
On whose oil-wells your stupendous wealth is based
By whose presence this ceremony is graced
Our great inventor, thanks to your banking account
Was able to sting you for a sizable amount
And so in this week-end's great race we folk
Can cheer on our hero Theodore Rimspoke
Driving a very speedy vehicle which
Bears the name of my modest shanty:
The racing car II Tempo Gigante!
Thank you, Dapplenag, and may the Government grant your application... for a three-year
Bardic Travelling Scholarship.
And now I shall ask Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza to rise and be upstanding.
As funds from North Sea is not yet available for projects such as these... an overseas sheikh has generously stepped into the breach.
This entitles him to the honour of unveiling this super car.
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, she's all yours!
I must ask the audience to retain your seats and your composure.
We have TV coverage, and Theodore will now answer a few snaky questions.
Today's news features Rimspoke's sensational II Tempo Gigante... capable of challenging Gore-Slimey's
GT Super Boomerang Rapido.
Congratulations on the car!
I must say, equipped with radar and all?
That's right.
In the event of fog and landslides.
And to anticipate any concealed entrances.
Could we have a rundown?
Let's start with the cranking handle, which starts the engine up forward... which in turn starts the carburettor... which finally activates the rocket engine at the rear.
- And then she really moves, eh?
- You could say that, yes.
And your top speed?
With twelve cylinders and pure alcohol fuel... and a gaggle of rockets raring to go... the old bus could hardly be described as a slowcoach.
This job is designed with front-and rear-wheel drive... as well as direct fuel injection slap in the jet... using the cantilever method.
And I've installed two speedometers... serially linked so that one takes over when the other registers maximum.
- And then this rotary wind-gauge...
- And what about this brake-block?
Same system as on a bike, but reinforced.
- And what's this device?
- That's blood type Rhesus B Plus.
And Rhesus Minus, and a dash of blue blood if we should bump into a baron.
- Or some other aristocrats.
- Very smart.
How about a look at the cockpit?
No. That wouldn't interest the public.
- Top secret, maybe?
- Um...
Well, it only remains for me to wish
Rimspoke every success in the race.
And now back to our compère,
Dairy Manager Oliver Clapthwaite.
Thanking you.
And now our local band will conclude this ceremony... with a specially composed march,
Cantata Opus Two... by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
But first a special welcome to another prominent visitor, Emanuel Desperados.
Private chauffeur, born right round the last bend of the Limpopo River.
He has kindly consented to assist in the role of guest drummer.
And now you can see Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza arriving in his Rolls-Royce... driven by Emanuel Desperados.
This great magnate is the owner of Aladdin Oil.
There's an air of excitement here as we await the start of this epic encounter... between the world's leading drivers.
Now here's No. 3 coming up to start.
The Italian Ruffino Gassolini... known as the Turin Daredevil, in his Bertone Carabo.
No. 12 is the German Heinrich von
Schnellfahrt, in his red Abarth 2000... the celebrated speed-merchant with glass-eye and monocle.
Here's No. 5, the Swede
Ronny Turnip Anderson... the Gothenburg Gogetter, followed by
No. 8, the Argentine Carlos Fandango.
The pampas playboy who ran slap into a wall and escaped without a scratch.
An impressive array of horsepower.
There's one question of special interest to fans: Has Aladdin Oil acted wisely... in staking money and prestige on a mere cycle-repairer?
I imagine the people in Pinchcliffe...
will follow today's event with
special attention to their hero.
Let's have a closer look
at Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is just leaving the pits.
What competition can his home-made
design, II Tempo Gigante, offer?
It seems hardly likely that an
prototype built by a cycle-repairer...
will go the full 25 laps
of today's gruelling Grand Prix.
But during yesterdays acceleration test
II Tempo Gigante showed a speed... that ensured it a surprisingly good starting position.
In the Snake Oil pit the director of the
Dry Rot and Fungus Control Authority... and ace driver Gore-Slimey is behind the wheel of his Boomerang Rapido.
Rudolph Gore-Slimey has a string of victories in his car... with a great many hush-hush features.
Only a handful of intimates know what's concealed beneath the black bonnet.
His co-driver, in a cockpit designed on
Spitfire lines, is Eleaser Cassandra... whose gift of second sight has proved invaluable in a tight corner.
Less is known of Theodore Rimspoke's co-driver, Sonny Duckworth.
Two novices to the track that should be watched with interest.
In 30 seconds from now this impressive pack of speed-hungry roadsters... will be streaking across the line in the Grand Prix of the Century.
Five, four, three, two, one!
They're off! The home-made contraption already seems to be in trouble.
This is bound to be a severe disappointment to Aladdin Oil.
The German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt in his Abarth 2000 has taken the lead... closely pursued by the Italian
Ruffino Gassolini and Gore-Slimey.
But now it looks like they've managed to crank II Tempo Gigante into action.
She seems to be firing on all twelve cylinders.
She's off, and good luck to her.
She's got a lot of leeway to make up.
Not a very encouraging start
for the good people of Pinchcliffe.
It does really look as if Rimspoke is putting his best foot forward.
Gore-Slimey in the lead followed by
McQuick, the Swede and Gassolini.
In a moment they'll be completing the first lap.
Gore-Slimey has been passed by the Irishman McQuick.
Here they come. Gore-Slimey flashing past still in the lead.
With nine laps to go, Rimspoke is lagging 30 seconds behind the leaders.
He has a lot of ground to make up.
And now the Argentine ace
Carlos Fandango goes into the lead.
And now it looks as if Rimspoke really has got his horsepower harnessed.
By my stopwatch he's pulled in as much as 15 seconds on his first lap... which is sensational. We should not write off Aladdin Oil's chances yet.
Gore-Slimey once again in the lead with
Nos. 4, 12, 3, 8 and 5 in hot pursuit.
Followed by Rimspoke.
He must have put in a tremendous burst!
Rimspoke's backers are clearly elated.
The wee chappie now facing the camera is one of Rimspoke's rusty assistants.
No doubt his first visit
on a race-track.
A popular feature
in this tough competition.
A message: Would the owner of the car registered PP 14U2... parked on a manhole outside
Entrance C kindly remove his vehicle... as a Drainage and Water Board inspector is anxious to return home.
We are just coming up for another lap.
And Gore-Slimey is still in the lead.
Amazing what Rimspoke is getting out of his car.
Can he really keep going?
Rimspoke has now rejoined the bunch, and Schnellfahrt answers with a spurt.
Rimspoke's giving all his got, but seems to be having trouble with his engine.
He's falling back.
But he's picking up again... and is hot on the heels of
McQuick, Gassolini and Anderson.
Going into the hairpin bend we get a ding-dong struggle... between Schnellfahrt and Rimspoke.
Out of the bend we have
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke.
Rimspoke must have gone into a bit of a skid. His car seems a bit stern-heavy.
There's a dramatic tussle going on, with Gore-Slimey still in the lead.
And there goes Rimspoke, shooting into the lead. Aladdin Oil... is leading in the Grand Prix!
II Tempo Gigante passing the stands with a clear lead.
But it sounds like she is misfiring?
The subsequent order is Gore-Slimey,
Fandango, Schnellfahrt, Gassolini... and the Swede Turnip Anderson.
Rimspoke is clearly in trouble.
His engine is definitely labouring.
Gore-Slimey is coming up hand over first.
Now he's passed him and is in the lead again!
Things seem to be going disastrously wrong for Rimspoke and Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is being overhauled by the rest of the field. My, what a pity.
After such a splendid performance by this unusual vehicle!
But that's the way things go!
Snake Oil first with the German second.
Just behind these two comes Fandango.
The field's spreading out now.
And here's the Swede leaving the pits after a spot of trouble.
But II Tempo Gigante is obviously in still greater trouble.
She is being taken hand of by her team of mechanics.
Now the German seems to be making a bid. Fandango breathing down his neck.
The field seems to be massing for a thrilling attack on the leaders.
Rimspoke is really back in the race!
Talk about a quick start! Nothing like it since the Apollo went into orbit.
Driver and co-driver must have been subject to something like 3 G!
Once again Rimspoke challenges the cream of the world's racing drivers.
This can develop into something truly spectacular!
Looks as if Aladdin Oil have called on their second driver. What a gamble!
Gassolini holding on to a slim lead, closely followed by the others.
What about Rimspoke and his new second driver?
It's obvious that II Tempo Gigante is now performing superbly.
Rimspoke is closing in on the field.
But Gore-Slimey has pulled ahead and has a clear lead.
Gore-Slimey has a commanding lead, and passes... there.
The rest of the field is nicely bunched, with the German in front.
But Rimspoke is now only seven seconds behind the German.
Rimspoke, clearly full of go is only
15 seconds behind Gore-Slimey.
It's going to be hard to predict the winner.
Things are really hotting up.
The German is back in the lead... with the others breathing down his neck.
Il Tempo Gigante is putting on a terrific spurt and catching up!
It's a neck-and-neck struggle between
Gore-Slimey and Theodore Rimspoke.
Gore-Slimey is just hanging on to his lead... but the others are hard on his heels.
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke are leaving the rest of the field inexorably behind.
Now what's happening?
Gore-Slimey pulls away.
Rimspoke is in trouble, with II Tempo
Gigante threatening to disintegrate.
Gore-Slimey is starting on the last lap.
But where is Rimspoke?
There! He seems to have got his engine going full blast once again!
Gore-Slimey can't be sure of victory.
Both cars being squeezed to the limit.
This is the last and decisive lap, and
a final maximum effort is called for.
This speed must be a terrific strain
on chassis, engine, tyres,...
and the drivers themselves.
Here things are really getting dramatic.
Il Tempo Gigante is enveloped in smoke.
Is she on fire?
A highly dramatic finish!
Rimspoke comes out of the bend with
Gore-Slimey scraping his exhaust.
He flashes across the line there!
Winner of the Grand Prix of the century!
In third place the German, followed by the Argentinean, Irishman and Italian.
What a race, what a finish, and what a triumph for our village cycle-repairer... and a sheikh who staked his reputation and money on his intuition.
We congratulate Pinchcliffe, the native village of the three worthies... who ensured II Tempo Gigante such a sensational triumph.
The cup and the laurels were just one more incident... in the lives of Theodore,
Sonny, and Lambert.
They'll be back at their daily chores tomorrow, with petty quarrels... inventions and the manufacture of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy.
- Tonight you have the inside berth!
- Can I?
- Is that really possible?
- Take the inside when I tell you to!
Goodness me!
Snitchery pooh.
- Nighty!
- Nighty!

'We were not the Railway Children to begin with.
'I don't suppose we even thought about railways
'except as a means of getting to the theatre and the zoo.
'We were just ordinary suburban children
'and we lived with Father and Mother
'in an ordinary red brick fronted villa
'with coloured glass in the front door... '
Come on.
'... a tiled passage that was called a hall
'and big fires in big fireplaces.
'We even had a gas fire in the breakfast room
'and a servant's bell board.
'In fact, every modern convenience. '
Chins up!
'There we three of us. '
Now let's arrange your pretty hair.
'That's me, I'm Roberta.
'They call me Bobbie, sometimes Lanky.
'I'm the eldest, worst luck.
'That's Phyllis, who means well.
'And that's Peter, who wants to be an engineer. '
And don't forget to watch the dickey bird.
Watch the birdie.
'Mother did not spend all her time paying dull calls to dull ladies
'and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls on her.
'She was always there, with us. '
'We had a father who was just perfect.
Her light's growing dim and if it goes out, then she's dead.
She says she would be get well again if children believed in fairies.
- Do you believe in fairies?
- Yes.
That's not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?
Yes!
It's still not loud enough.
Do you believe in fairies?
YES!
Yes, I certainly do!
Mmm, it smells gorgeous.
It's fabulous, absolutely fabulous.
Now altogether... one, two, three.
Well done!
Happy Christmas!
I love you.
'You will think that we ought to have been very happy
'and we were but we did not know how happy
'till the pretty life at Edgecombe Villa was over and done with
'and we had to live a very different life indeed. '
Peter my boy, come here.
Dad... it's perfect.
It's more perfect than any one could ever dream of.
Thank you, Dad.
'The dreadful change came quite suddenly. '
You heaving brute!
'And that was the last we saw of poor Potts. '
What a wreck!
- Is there any hope?
- Hope?
Of course, it'll want hope yes, and a new valve.
I'll tell you what, I'll give up
Saturday afternoon to it.
Yes, and you can help me.
I hate doing a job like this especially at Christmas.
Who on earth is that?
An Englishman's house is his castle, but
I wish they had moats and drawbridges!
Come in.
Yes?
Please, sir. There are two gentlemen wish to see you.
I've shown them into the study, sir,
I hope that was all right?
Excuse me.
I wish we did have a moat and drawbridge.
Then if we didn't want anyone to...
I've never heard anything so preposterous. When? Who?
- Why's Daddy shouting?
- I don't know, dear.
Come in.
Yes, Ruth?
What is it?
Please, ma'am, the Master wants you to just step into the study.
Look, I'm not going to say a thing!
Come in.
I will not!
All right, cabby,
Scotland Yard.
It's bed-time.
Ruth will put you to bed.
But you promised we could stay up late.
Daddy was going to play with us.
Father's been called away... on business.
Go up at once darlings, please.
It wasn't bad news, was it, Mummy?
Is anyone dead or...
Oh, no, nobody's dead.
I can't tell you anything about it tonight.
Up you go.
Well, good night then.
Ruth!
What's up?
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
You'll know soon enough.
- Phyl?
- Yes.
If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying then we won't know.
- That's all.
- All right.
She's gone into London, that's all I know.
Now just you eat up.
Some dire calamity's happening,
I just know it.
Good evening, Mrs Waterbury.
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Sally.
Oh, it's so cold!
Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on.
My darlings, those men last night did bring very bad news and Father will be away for some time
Is it something to do with the Government, Mummy?
Yes... yes, it is.
Now it's bed time, my darlings.
And don't worry.
It will all come right in the end.
Don't you worry either because we'll be as good as gold.
Oh, we used to say life was so dull...
Nothing ever happened like in books.
Now something has happened.
Yes, it has and it's made Mother unhappy.
Everything's horrid...
...just horrid.
Stairs... stairs... stairs...
'Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks.
'Mother was nearly always out,
'the between maid was sent away...
'... and Aunt Emma came on a visit.
- Good afternoon, children.
- Good afternoon, Aunt Emma.
Your mother has sent for me in her distress, and I'm here for a while but not for long.
I'm off to India as a governess and as I shall be busy preparing for my arduous journey,
I shall require you to be seen and not heard.
Preferably to be not seen and not heard.
Children should be kept in their proper places.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Aunt Emma.
- Yes, Aunt Emma.
- Excellent.
You may kiss me if you wish.
# You can hear them sigh and wish to die
# You can see them wink the other eye
# At the man who broke the Bank at Monte Carlo
Altogether now
# As I walked along the Bois Boulogne with an inde... #
I have asked you not to use them utensils in that manner.
I was up at four this morning cleaning them as if I haven't got enough to do what with the between maid leaving and now your aunt asking me to heave bloomin' great boxes about like I was a navvy or something.
- Ruth.
- Yes?
There's no need to be so rude.
Cook was just trying to cheer us up.
Come on, you two.
Well...
I'm very surprised at you, Cook.
Where's your dignity?
And take that silly hat off.
Get yourself dressed properly.
I don't know I seem to do all the work round here.
We shouldn't really Peter, she'll get soaked.
It's too late, she's coming.
Stairs... stairs... stairs...
I'll have fallen arches before me holiday.
I hope you're undressed and ready, master Peter.
I haven't got all night, you know.
- Yes, Ruth.
- Good...
You...!
- Oh! Stop it!
- You nasty little limb, you!
If you don't mend your ways you'll go where your precious father's gone, so I tell you straight.
Ruth!
Huh!
We're going to have to play at being poor for a while.
We're moving to a darling little house in the country, up in Yorkshire.
- What?
- I know you'll love it
- Is Aunt Emma coming?
- No, Peter, unfortunately not.
- Don't you want a 1st Class, madam?
- No, Second. Thank you.
Ah, looked like 1st Class quality to me.
- Are we on the right train for Yorkshire?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Ooh... careful.
Give that to me.
- I'll take that bag.
- Thank you so much.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
Excuse me.
We want to go to the house on the hill.
The Three Chimneys.
- Er, do you know the way?
- I daresay.
- Well, will you show us?
- I dare say.
- Phyllis, are you all right?
- Yes.
Can't we put just one box on your cart?
You asked me to show you the way, nothing was said about boxes.
Never mind, darlings.
It's only a few more yards.
I wonder why she didn't leave the lights on.
Who is she?
Mrs Viney, The woman I engaged to clean the place and to get the supper.
I expect Mrs Viney's gone home.
Your train was late, see.
But she's got the key.
What do we do?
She'll have left that under the doorstep.
- We all do hereabouts.
- Well you might have said so.
You never asked, did you?
Nothing was said about a door key.
- May I borrow your lamp, please?
- I daresay.
If you say "I daresay" once more,
I shall have hysterics, I daresay
Oh... there we are.
What's that?
It's only the rats.
God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform.
Ow!
Rats!
I wish we hadn't come.
Don't you worry, darlings.
I saw a paraffin lamp on the table, we'll soon have some light.
Oh, those poor little mice, they were so frightened.
I don't believe they were rats at all.
You've often said you wanted something to happen, well now it has.
It's quite exciting, isn't it?
I told Mrs Viney to get some meat and bread and have some supper ready.
I wonder where...
Oh, I suppose she's laid it in the dining room.
Come along darlings, up here.
Let's go and see.
Come along.
Oh darlings, mind the steps.
Mind how you go, Peter.
Oh, that beastly woman!
She's taken the money and not left us any food.
Aren't we going to have any supper tonight? I'm starving!
I know! There's some food in the cases in the cellar.
Aunt Emma sent them on ahead of us. Come along.
Mind the step.
Come along, Bobbie, it's a real feast.
Sardines, biscuits, ginger.
Raisins...
No Phyl, no! You do not put the marmalade spoon in to the sardines.
Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy.
Tell you what, let's drink Aunt Emma's health.
- Good idea.
- Here's to Aunt Emma.
- To Aunt Emma.
- Aunt Emma.
And all who sail in her.
- Oh! What's that, Mummy?
- Pie.
- Pie?
- Apple Pie.
Apple pie for breakfast?
Then we're not poor after all.
This is the supper we should have had.
I found it in that little room that we thought was a cupboard, so Mrs Viney wasn't so bad after all.
- Good morning, can I help you?
- I expect so. Viney's the name.
Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus.
Do come in.
We're just been talking about you.
Oh, I see you found your supper then.
Funny time to have it though.
It was like a great dragon tearing by.
A dragon's house looks like that tunnel.
I never thought we'd ever get so near to a train as this.
- It's better than toy engines, isn't it?
- I don't know, it's different.
It seems so odd to see all of a train.
It's so tall.
I've always seen them cut in half by platforms
I wonder if that train's going to London?
London is where Daddy is.
- We don't know that, Phyl.
- He might be.
How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Yes.
- Could I ask you two questions?
- Yes, well it depends what they are.
I can't spend all day conversationalising with the junior public.
Now what are they?
What's the white mark on the coal heap for?
That's to tell you how much coal there is you see, in case anybody nicks it.
Second question, please.
Do you know anything about engines?
Do I know anything about engines?
Why?
- Because I've got one.
- Er, what gauge?
I don't know anything about gauges, but it's about this big.
Yes?
- It's brass and it blew up.
- It blew up.
Well just excuse me young man,
I've got a lot to do cos the Station Master's having his hair cut in Leeds, you see and Perks must be about it.
- Perks? Who's Perks?
- Me, sir. I'm Perks.
Right on time.
- What is?
- This ere's the Scots Flyer.
Why is it going so slowly,
Mr Perks?
Why... well it's all up hill to Scotland, isn't it?
That train's going to Scotland.
If Daddy's not in London, he's in Scotland and that train is going to Scotland.
Perhaps, Phyl.
I don't think we're going to enjoy being poor, you know, being cold and all that.
Phyllis, try to imagine it as an adventure.
All sorts of things might happen.
Mother could write about it.
Write a book.
You never know.
We won't always be poor, Phyllis,
I'm sure.
All right. Good night.
Good night.
I'm still cold though.
...lightly on the-cheek.
...one of the men, in a bowler hat, opened the door...
Father did not turn, but left without a word.
Why don't we ask the next train to take our love to Daddy?
Trains don't carry people's love, they'd be above that.
Yes, they do if you tame them first.
I wonder why Daddy hasn't written to us.
Mummy says he's too busy. he'll write soon, she says.
Well, why don't we wave anyway?
Three waves won't matter.
We won't miss them.
Charming...
Charming!
About time they had it seen to.
The coal in the little shed has held out well, Bobbie.
There was hardly any there yesterday when I looked.
Well, we've only had one fire.
I know but I could swear there's more than when we first came.
- That's silly.
- Course it's silly.
So it's you, Pete.
- It's you.
- It's me what?
It's you that's been putting the coal in the shed.
But where from Pete, for heaven's sake?
From the coal heap of course, they've got stacks of it there.
But that's stealing!
Don't you remember your catechism?
"Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"
It wasn't stealing.
It was mining.
I took from the top.
That's mining, not stealing.
If it was, all the miners in the world would be in jug.
Oh, Pete... Pete!
Oh Pete, Pete.
We'll have to take it all back.
- What?
- All of it.
- All of it.
- All of it!
All of it.
There can't be anything wrong in trying to keep your own mother warm.
That can't be wrong.
It's all right Pete, at least we can burn the evidence.
Mrs Viney, here we are.
I've got the buns for tea.
- Buns?
- Yes, Mummy sold a story and...
Mrs Viney, what's the matter?
It's your dear ma, master Peter, she's... she's very poorly.
You'd better go back to the village and get Dr Forrest.
Right.
Don't let her die, Mrs Viney.
Doctor Forrest!
Mother's very ill, please come quickly,
Stay there, my boy.
Influenza.
But not serious.
Now my Lady Grave-airs,
I suppose you'll want to be head nurse?
- Of course, Doctor.
- Right.
Now we'll send down some medicine.
Keep a good fire going and have some strong beef tea ready to give her the moment the fever goes down...
She can have the grapes now and the soda water.
Oh, and you'd better get a bottle of brandy.
You can go in now...
May I have the list?
Don't worry, funny face.
She's head nurse but you can be Matron.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, what utter nonsense,
I can't afford all that.
I haven't an idea in my head for a story so there won't even be buns for tea for some time.
Tell Mrs Viney to boil some scrag-end of neck for your dinner tomorrow then I'll have some of the broth.
But even if we never have anything to eat at all you can't afford all those other things.
Right. So we've got to think of some other way.
Now everybody, think.
Just as hard as ever you can, think!
- I, O, N.
- You sure?
Yes.
I...
O...
N.
There. Brilliant.
"Look out at the station. "
Definitely one of your best works,
Michael Angelo.
Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!
Oakworth!
Oakworth Station.
Oh, I thought I'd missed you.
You are the man who waves to us, aren't you?
- Mind the doors, please.
- Aren't you?
- Yes my dear, I wave...
- Oh, will you take this, please.
We chose you because we thought you had such a kind face.
Er, mind the doors please, Miss.
Sir. On the way, Mr, Mitchell.
Thank you, Mr Perks.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
Oh dear!
Oh! Good evening.
The name's Perks.
I believe we've met.
Yes, you were busy’cause of the Station Master being in Leeds.
Yes, even busier now
'cause he had a drop too much down at the Britannia Arms and fell over and broke his daft leg playing billiards.
- Of course it was his own fault.
- Why?
He should've used the rest.
He will do that over the edge, you see.
The old gent asked me to fetch this up straight away.
Thank you very much, Mr Perks.
I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence to give you like Father does, but...
Hey! Just stop that, please.
I wasn't thinking about no tuppences.
I just came to say I was sorry to hear your mama wasn't so well and to ask how she finds herself this evening.
Oh and I've er, I brought her a bit of sweet briar.
It's very sweet to smell that is.
Tuppence indeed.
Thank you very much and I beg your pardon about the twopence.
No offences, I'm sure.
No offence.
And just to show I'll er,
I'll have a look at that blown up brass engine of yourn, shall I?
- What?
- Yes.
Oh, can you manage?
Bit heavy... Here you are.
Oh. Is that it?
Bit of a mess, isn't it?
Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do.
- Good evening.
- Thank you, Mr Perks. Good night.
- Oh!
- Oh, look at that!
Oh, everything...
"Dear Roberta, Phyllis and Peter,
"here are the things you want.
"Your mother will want to know where they came from
"so please ask her to forgive me
"for taking the liberty of allowing myself the great pleasure.
"Yours sincerely, G. P... Something. "
I can't read it.
I think we were right to ask him.
Right? Of course we're right.
I don't fancy telling Mother the whole truth about this.
We shouldn't do that until she's completely well.
And when she is, we'll be so happy we shan't mind the fuss.
Oh, look at those roses!
I'll take them up to her.
- And the sweetbriar.
- Oh, thank you.
Cor, look!
I wonder what's in there.
So that's an end to it! Now listen.
It's true, we're poor, but we shall have enough to live on as long as I have ideas for stories.
But you mustn't go about telling people of our affairs. It isn't right!
And you must never, never, never ask strangers to give you things.
Always remember that.
- Yes, Mother.
- I shall write to your old gentleman and I shall tell him that I didn't approve.
I shall thank him too, of course, for his kindness, but it you that I don't approve of, not the old gentleman.
He's been extremely kind.
You can give my letter to your Mr Perks to give to him.
And we won't say any more about it.
Isn't she marvellous when she's angry?
Hello, head-nurse.
That's funny, I was thinking about you.
I wanted to talk to you, Doctor.
- Your mother's not worse I hope?
- No, but...
Come on, we'll go for a ride.
This is great fun.
Come on, out with it, head-nurse.
What's the trouble?
It's rather hard, you see, to’out with it' because of what Mother said.
What did Mother say?
She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor.
- But you aren't everyone, are you?
- Not at all. Well?
Well, I know doctors are very expensive and Mrs Viney told me that her doctor only cost her twopence a week
- because she belonged to a club.
- Yes.
Well, could we join your club too, please?
The same as Mr Viney.
You aren't cross with me, are you?
Cross? How could I be?
You're a very sensible little woman.
Now don't you worry.
I'll make it all right with your mother, even if I have to make a special brand-new club just for her.
Thank you.
Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up in here.
Here's a new ribbon for you.
There, the surprise is ready.
When the bell rings again you can come into the dining room.
Come on, Pete.
Of course.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, head-nurse.
Happy birthday, Miss Roberta.
My darling.
I helped to make it.
Happy birthday, Lanky.
# She was beautiful as a butterfly
# Proud as a queen
# Was pretty little Polly Perkins
# Of Paddington Green #
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you.
Lanky indeed!
Fatty.
- Hope you enjoy the cake.
- It's lovely. Thank you very much.
- Have a lovely party, my dear.
- Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
Wouldn't Daddy have loved this?
Thank you very much,
Mrs Waterbury.
Good night, good night.
Happy birthday!
Hey, happy birthday!
I hope Mother doesn't get too wet in Wakefield.
We don't want her ill again.
It's like being in a besieged castle, the arrows of the foe striking against the battlements.
No, it's more like a great big garden-squirt.
- You're a great big garden squirt
- Thank you.
Stop it you two!
There's a train coming.
Oakworth! Oakworth Station!
Oakworth!
Oakworth Station!
Come on. Don't mind the rain, it's only a shower.
That's it, thank you.
Mind the doors, please.
Mind the doors now.
Mind the doors, come on.
Right away, Mr Mainprice
Mother should be on the next train in about fifteen minutes.
That one was from London, I think.
Hey, there's something going at the end of the station.
Yes, something's happened, come on.
If you ask me this is a case for the police courts.
No, the infirmary more like.
Let me pass please, will you?
I'll deal with this if you please.
- What's he say?
- Sounds like French to me.
I was in Calais once for a day.
- That's not French.
- Well what is it then if it's not French?
I don't know.
It's not French, I know that.
No, that's not French.
Nothing like it.
Try him with French if you know so much then, clever dick.
Parlez vous français, Monsieur?
Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci!
Enfin un amis.
Mon petit vous ne soures jamais combien je suis content.
- Now that's French.
- What's he say?
I don't know...
Yes, well all right everybody.
Keep moving along, please.
I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you.
All right now, now, now...
Go on.
Take him into the waiting room.
Mother can talk French.
She's on the next train from Wakefield.
Right. Come on.
He thinks you're a policeman.
He thinks you're going to shut him up.
I know he does.
Look at his eyes.
They're like a fox's eyes when the beast is in a trap.
Vous attendre.
Ma mere parlez français.
Nous...
- What's "being kind"?
- Er, "bon" is good.
Nous sommes bon pour vous, Monsieur.
Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at the Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it.
C'est bon.
Ma mere arrive, c'est bon.
Je vous aide.
Look I'm not sure we oughtn't to send for police.
- Don't!
- Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes.
She speaks French beautifully.
You'd love to hear her.
I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison for.
Yes, well he looks without visible means to me.
Still I don't mind waiting till your mama comes.
I'd like to know what country has got the credit of him.
Look, I've got an idea.
Foreign stamps.
We'll show them these.
Regardes les stamps.
Quelle patrie?
Ah... Ruskie...
- Ruskie.
- My lord, he's Russian.
Yeah, I-I thought he was.
I'll wait here till you bring Mummy in.
Not afraid?
No.
Oakworth Station! Mrs Waterbury,
I have something to tell you.
- Mummy, we found a Russian.
- There's a fellow in there, he's Russian.
Close the doors.
Right away, Guard!
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?
Hello, Bobbie.
Qui est vous?
Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky.
Oh, it's all right.
Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest.
- We'll take him home with us, Mr Perks.
- Thank you, Madam.
Come on, help him on the other side.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, she'll look after you.
I knew he was a Russian.
Doctor.
I need to tell you.
Mother's got a very shabby Russian.
Your mother's got a very shabby what?
He'll have to join your club.
I'm certain he hasn't any money.
We found him at the station.
- Found him? Was he lost then?
- Yes, that's what he was.
He's been telling Mother life story in French.
She said would you please come directly.
He's got a nasty cough and he's been crying.
Oh, don't smile.
Please don't.
You wouldn't if you'd seen him.
I've never seen a man cry before.
Haven't you?
I do it all the time.
Bobbie!
I know you said we weren't to ask any questions but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he?
Oh, my darling, no.
Bobbie, look at me.
Daddy was quite, quite well when I heard from him last and he'll come back to us some day.
Do tell us about the Russian.
That can't make a long story, my darling, because I'm very tired.
He's a very clever writer, but in Russia one dare not say anything about the rich people doing wrong or what ought to be done for the poor.
If one does, one is sent to prison.
Well he wrote a book about it all and he was three years in a dungeon.
No light, damp and dreadful.
Then they took him out and they sent him to Siberia and he was condemned to stay there for life.
- For life? For writing a book?
- That's stupid.
Go on, Mama.
While he was at the mines, some friends got a message to him to say that his wife and children had escaped to England.
So after many adventures he too escaped and came here to look for them.
- Do you think he will find them?
- Oh, I do hope so.
I think my darlings, in your prayers you might ask God to show his pity upon all prisoners and captives.
To show his pity upon all prisoners and captives?
Yes, darling.
Upon all the prisoners and captives.
Merci.
He seemed pleased. I wish we could think of other things to give him.
What about strawberries?
Perks promised me some from his own garden ages ago.
Look at that tree over there!
Lor, it's moving!
So are the others...
It's magic.
What is it?
It's much too magic for me.
I don't like it, I'm going home.
Cor, that'll take some sweeping up.
Hey! The 11:29 down hasn't gone by yet.
We must let them know at the station, there'll be an accident.
- Let's run!
- No, come back.
It's too late, it's two miles away.
- We do something to the telegraph wires.
- But we don't know how.
If we only had something red, we could go down on to the line and wave it.
But the train wouldn't see us till it came round the corner. That's too late.
We could go round and wave to the train.
We might wave anyway.
No. They'd only think it was us as usual, we've waved so often before.
- Flannel petticoats!
- I beg your pardon?
- Flannel petticoats.
- Of course! Take them off.
- Now.
- You're not going to tear them, Pete?
- Oh, shut up
- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.
If we can't stop the train, there'll be an accident with people killed.
Now sticks, come on.
- I'll have two. It was my idea.
- They're our petticoats!
What's it matter who waves what if we can only stop the train.
Stand firm and wave like mad.
Keep off the line, Bobbie.
They won't see us.
It's all no good.
- Stand off the line, Bobbie.
- It's all no good.
- Stand back!
- Not yet. Not yet!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stand back.
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Stop.
Stop...
Stop.
Stop. There's been an earthquake.
Don't move you'll all be killed.
The trees are walking down the bank and there's a mountain of great stones.
We'll have a look at this earthquake then get back to the train.
Bobbie.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think you'll agree with me that we have three charming children here who are indeed an example to us all.
All right chaps, this is it.
One, two, three.
...I have learned in the short time I have seen them to look forward to knowing them better.
If I had to rename the Waterbury children,
I would call them the Three Saviours of the Steel Road or perhaps the Railway Children.
And now my dears, from the directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful recognition of a courageous and brave action which averted an accident on August 15th, 1905.
Oh, thank you.
It's your turn now.
Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen".
- Oh, lor!
- No, "Ladies and gentlemen".
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, we shall treasure these watches for the rest of our lives.
What I mean to say is, thank you all very much indeed.
One, two.
You must be very proud,
Mrs Waterbury.
And er, this is from me.
It was a wonderful day, wasn't it?
The kind that very seldom happens.
But I did so want to talk to the old gentleman about something else.
What did you want to say to him?
I'll tell you,
I've written him a letter.
"My dearest old gentleman,
I want to ask you something, please.
"If you get out of the train and go by the next it would do.
"I do not want you to give me anything -
Mother says we ought not to.
"Besides, we only want to talk to you about a prisoner and captive.
"Your loving friend, Bobbie. "
Very good.
Yes, it is.
My heart's thumping like a steam engine, right under my sash, too.
People's hearts aren't under their sashes.
I don't care, mine is.
If you're going to talk like a poetry book, my heart's in my mouth.
My heart's in my boots if it comes to that.
- He'll think we're idiots.
- He won't be far wrong.
Oakworth!
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Perks.
- Hello. This is a very great pleasure.
- It was good of you to get out.
Er, may I extend a cordial invitation to the use of my room, sir?
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir.
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.
If you'd care to follow me, sir just along here.
- Nice and tidy for you sir.
- Ah, thank you, Perks.
- I'll leave you to it then, sir.
- Thank you.
Well?
Well?
What is it?
- Oh, please...
- Yes?
- What I mean to say is...
- Yes?
- I wish I might say something.
- I wish you would say something.
Well then... it's about our Russian.
- Captive.
- A captive.
We want more than anything in the world to find his wife and children for him.
Only we don't know how.
- What did you say his name was?
- I'll write it for you.
Um, would you have a pencil and the back of an envelope?
Here, write it here.
This is how you write it.
You say... Szczepansky.
That man?
Bless my soul...
I've read his book.
So your mother took him in like the good Samaritan.
I'll tell you what, youngsters, your mother must be a very good woman.
- Yes, she is.
- And you're a good man.
You flatter me.
Now am I to tell you what I think of you?
- Oh, please don't.
- Why?
I don't know why exactly, only if it's something horrid
I don't want you to.
And if it's something nice
I'd rather you didn't.
Then all I will say is that I'm very glad you came to me about all this, very glad indeed.
And I shouldn't be surprised if I don't find out something very soon.
Well now tell me something about yourselves.
Tea first.
Who on earth?
Let's go and see.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Good news, my dears.
I've found your Russian friend's wife and children.
- Oh!
- And I couldn't resist the temptation of having the pleasure of telling him
No, you tell him, my dear.
And the other two will show me the way.
Mother, Mr Szczepansky's wife and children have been found.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.
Goodbye.
Excellent.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Ah! There, that's a likely little brooch that.
I don't know as ever I seen a thing more like a buttercup, without it were a buttercup.
Mother gave it to me for my birthday.
Oh, is that it?
I didn't see it close to.
It highly decorative that, thank you.
- When's your birthday, Mr Perks?
- My birthday?
I gave up keeping my birthday afore you lot were born.
But you must have been born sometime, you know.
Even if it was 20 years ago or 30 years ago or 60 or 70.
Yeah, well it weren't quite so long as that.
If you really want to know, it's my 42 years come the 15th of this month.
Why don't you keep it then?
I've got other things to keep besides birthdays.
Oh what?
Not secrets, Mr Perks.
No, the kids and bloomin' missus.
I've sold another story, darlings, the one about the King of the Mussels so there'll be buns for tea.
You can go and got them the moment they're ready.
Would you mind if we didn't them tonight, but on the 15th? That's next Thursday.
I don't mind, darling, but why?
Well, it's Mr Perks' birthday, he's 42.
He says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, he's got other things to keep.
Not rabbits and secrets, but the kids and the bloomin' missus.
- His wife and children, Bobbie.
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ of endearment, isn't it?
- Term of endearment, Phyl.
- Yes.
We thought we'd make a nice birthday for him.
He's been very nice to us.
And we agreed that next bun day we'd ask if we could.
It would be rather nice to write his name on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?
- Perks isn't a very pretty name.
- Albert's his other name, I asked once.
I think Albert's a pretty name.
What's the matter with that?
What about flowers?
He's got lots of flowers of his own, hasn't he?
Yes, but it's always nice to be given them.
Let's all just sit and think.
No one's to speak until they've thought of something.
- I've got it.
- What?
- Perks is so nice to everyone, right?
- Right.
So there must be lots of people who'd like to help make him a birthday.
Mother said we weren't to ask people for things.
For ourselves, she meant, not for other people.
I think we should ask Mummy first.
There's no harm in it, it depends how you do it.
I only hope Mr Perks won't be offended and think it's charity.
Poor people can be very proud, you know.
It's not because he's poor, it's because we're fond of him.
All right, I'll look out some things that Phyllis has outgrown.
- Will that do?
- I'm sure he'd love that.
Come back tomorrow and I'll see what I can do.
- Oh, thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Thank you, bye bye.
I've always liked Mrs Ransome.
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Bye!
'Some people were kind and some were crusty
'and some would give some would not. '
It's Mr Perks' birthday on Thursday, would you like to give him a present?
- No, I would not. I hate the man.
- Thank you!
That was pretty rude.
'It's rather difficult work asking for things, even for other people.
'as you've no doubt found if you've ever tried it. '
Tobacco pipe, half a pound of tea.
- Woollen scarf from the Drapers.
- A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest.
There it is, you can have it and good riddance to it.
- Oh!
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Thank you, Mr James, he'll love that.
Goodbye.
Hello?
Hello, is anyone at home?
Me Mam's upstairs, a- changing herself.
Mam, visitors!
Thank you Patrick, just coming.
I'm a bit late changing, Miss, owing to me having had an extra clean up today along with Perks happening to say it's his birthday.
I don't know what put such an idea into his head.
We keeps the children's birthdays, of course, but him and me... Well, we've no time for suchlike as a general rule.
We know it was his birthday and we've brought him some presents.
Oh, bring them in my dears.
Oh, don't, please don't,
Mrs Perks.
Whatever is the matter?
Do you mean to say you don't like the things we brought?
Don't you like them?
Oh, there, there, don't mind me,
I'm all right.
Like them? Why it's a birthday such as Perks never had, not even when he were a boy.
Good, I'm glad you're pleased.
Could we wait and see if Mr Perks is pleased too?
I won't say another word.
Could we have a plate for the buns,
Mrs Perks?
Oh, of course.
Fit for a prince, I'd say.
I never thought there'd be more for him, except the ounce of his backie.
# I'm feeling right today
# Been a lovely day... #
Bless us, he's early.
Let's hide in there and you tell him about it but give him the tobacco first as you got it for him.
When you've told him, we'll shout "Many Happy Returns".
- How do.
- How do.
Hello, old woman.
- Well here's a pretty set out.
- It's your birthday tea, Bert.
And here's an ounce of your extra particular.
Yes, she's a good old girl.
Eh, what's that pram doing here?
Hey, you're not...?
Well, what's all these bundles?
Eh?
And what's all this sweet stuff and...?
What's this squirrel doing on the table, eh?
Oh, lor!
Whatever should we do?
I've forgotten to put the labels on any of the things.
He won't know what's from whom.
He'll think it's all from us and that we're trying to be grand and charitable or something horrid like that.
Ssh, be quiet!
I don't care. I won't stand it.
I tell you straight.
But, it's them children you make such a fuss about, the children from the Three Chimneys.
I don't care, not if it was angels from heaven.
We got on all right all these years and no favours asked.
I'm not having these charity goings-on at my time of life.
And don't you think it, Nell.
Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue, for goodness sake.
All three of’em is in the other room a- listening to every word you speaks.
I'll give them something to listen to.
I've spoke my mind to these afore and I'll do it again. Come out.
Come on out!
Out here, come on.
No, not you lot, you stop in...
Sophie, look put some pants on Benjamin, we've got company.
Right, you can tell me what you mean by it.
Have I ever complained of being short as you starts this charity with me?
We thought you'd be so pleased,
Mr Perks.
I'll never try and be kind to anyone else as long as I live.
- No, I won't. Not never!
- We didn't mean any harm.
It isn't what you means so much as what you does.
We thought you'd love it.
We always have things on our birthdays.
Oh ay, from your own relations, that's different.
No, not just our relations.
They're from all sorts of people in the village.
- And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.
- We did.
So you've been telling the neighbours that we can't make both ends meet.
Now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the neighbourhood, you can take that pack of tricks back where it came from.
I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.
I don't doubt that you meant it kind but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any longer, if it's all the same to you.
Look here.
We'll go if you like and you needn't be friends with us any more, but...
We'll always be friends with you, even though you're nasty to us.
But before we go, let us show you these labels to put on the things.
I don't want to see no labels except proper luggage labels in me own walk of life.
- Please let Bobbie show you the labels.
- All right, go on.
We wrote down everything everybody said when they gave us the things with the people's names on.
Because Mother said that we ought to be careful because...
Well I wrote down what she said and you'll see.
That's from Mother.
She thought Mrs Perks might like some of Phyllis' things.
"I can't do much... "
Well that's all right.
I mean, your ma's a born lady.
We'll keep the little frocks and what-not, Nell.
Yes, Albert.
Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries and sweets.
They're from Mrs Ransome.
I can't send the pram back, Bert, and I won't so don't ask me.
I'm not asking anything.
Then there's the shovel.
Mr James made that for you himself and he says...
Oh, where is it?
Oh, yes, here.
- No er, you can read it.
- He says,
"You tell Mr Perks it is a pleasure to make a little trifle for a man
"as is so much respected. "
He's a good chap, that.
He's a very good chap, that.
He's not bad at all, that chap.
And everybody who gave anything said they liked you and thought it was a very good idea of ours.
And nobody said anything about charity or anything horrid like that.
We thought that you'd love to know how fond everybody is of you.
And I've never so unhappy in all my born days.
Goodbye.
Come on.
Stop!
I take back every word I've said contrary to what you'd wish.
- Nell?
- Yes, Albert.
Put the kettle on.
We'll take away the things if you're unhappy with them.
I'm not unhappy about’em.
I don't know if I was ever better pleased.
...Not so much with the presents though frankly they're an A. 1 collection but the kind respect of our neighbours.
- That's worth having, eh Nell?
- I think it's all worth having...
And you've made a most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.
No, I haven't.
If a man didn't respect himself, no one wouldn't do it for him.
But everyone respects you.
They all said so.
We knew you'd like it once you understood.
Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?
May the garland of friendship be ever green.
May our garland of friendship be ever green, Mr Perks.
Hear, hear!
Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it?
Let's have a look at them buns you brought in. Where are they?
Who wrote that?
It's Albert.
Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Now go to sleep all of you and not another word.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.
Yeah they're jolly good little kids, those Waterburys.
Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts.
It's you that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was.
- I was ashamed of you, I tell you.
- You needn't be.
I climbed down handsome as soon as I understood it weren't charity.
Charity's one thing I never could abide, and won't neither.
- Go to sleep, Albert.
- Yes, dear.
I tell you this though, it isn't what you does so much as what you means, that's what I say.
- Now if it had been charity...
- Oh, drat charity, Bert.
Nobody won't offer you charity however much you was to want it.
That were just friendliness, that were.
I reckon it's what people call loving kindness.
- Now go to sleep, Bert.
- Yes dear, good night.
Good night, Bert.
Happy Birthday.
Nell?
Oh, all right, Bert, as it's your birthday.
Hello, my dears.
Hard at it, are yer?
Yeah. Well, er... Yeah.
One good turn deserves another, that's what I always say.
Hello, Mr Perks, how do mean?
Well I found these magazines, you see, in the waiting room.
I was cleaning up.
They were in a cupboard and well they're only collecting dust and...
Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I thought perhaps you might like them.
There's a lot of pictures in’em. and that, and you can colour’em up with chalks and that.
Anyway I don't want’em.
- You're a dear.
- Yes, you are.
- Hear, hear!
- Well, that's all right then.
I must be getting along.
I've got lots to do.
Perks must be about it.
Thank you.
That was very kind of him.
We'd better go inside, it's going to rain.
Daddy...
- Where's Bobbie?
- I thought I heard her upstairs.
She knows it's tea time.
I wonder if she's all right.
Bobbie?
What is it darling?
Oh, Mummy!
You don't believe Daddy did it?
- No.
- Because it's not true.
They have shut him in prison, but he's done nothing wrong.
He's good and honourable and he belongs to us.
Will it make you very unhappy if you tell me all about it?
I want to understand.
Do you remember the day those two men took Daddy away?
Yes, I do.
Well they arrested him, charging him with selling State secrets with being, in fact, a spy and a traitor.
How could anyone believe that?
How could anyone do such a thing?
Someone did.
Why didn't you tell someone, a lawyer?
There wasn't anyone who could hurt Daddy on purpose, was there?
I don't know.
It's all so complicated.
There was a man in the office who was very envious of your father.
Daddy always said he didn't quite trust him.
Why didn't you explain all that to someone?
No one would listen.
Do you suppose
I haven't tried everything?
No, my darling, what we have to do, you and I, and Daddy, is to be brave.
Where have you been?
Where have I been?
Down to the station.
Don't ask why, it's a secret.
Oh, please yourself.
- There's a paper chase tomorrow.
- Oh, whoopee!
- Who?
- The grammar school boys.
Oh zippee!
Perks says we can see them going along by the line.
Oh really?
What's a paper chase?
Let me pass please
Hey! That's against by-laws.
- I ought to report him.
- They're only having fun.
Passengers is forbidden to cross the line on any pretence.
He ain't no passenger.
He's out of sight now, anyway.
What the eye don't see the heart need take no notice of, that what I always say.
Come on then.
He's gone in the tunnel.
Oh, it is dark in here.
They don't know what they're in for.
It isn't easy running in the dark.
They'll take a long time going through, won't they?
Aye, they will that.
- They went that way.
- Oh thanks!
I know! Let's cut across to the top and see them come out the other end.
- We'll be there before they are.
- Good idea.
Yes, good idea!
- This way!
- No, this way. Come on, quick.
There, that's all.
What should we do now?
Not yet, there's one in a red jersey.
He hasn't come out yet.
Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth and perhaps we can see him from the inside.
It's dark in there.
- Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you.
- I don't like it.
Still no sign of him. I reckon he must have had an accident.
Let's go and rescue him.
Come on.
Come on, Phyl.
Keep close behind me.
If a train comes along get flat against the tunnel wall and hold your skirts against you.
I still don't like it.
- I want to go back.
- Ssh, don't be silly. What is that?
It's another earthquake!
- It's a train.
- Oh, let me go back!
Don't be a coward, it's quite safe.
Stand back.
Come in, come on.
It is a dragon.
I always thought it was.
Come on.
Supposing that boy was caught underneath the train...
- Oh!
- We've got to go and see.
Can't we go and get someone from the station?
- Phyl, you wait here.
- No.
Hello?
Hey you two, come quickly!
Oh, is that blood?
Is that red blood?
- Is he all killed?
- Phyllis, please.
Hurry up you two, get help.
"It was on a hot summer's afternoon... "
Oh, do come down, we've found a hound in a red jersey and he's broken his leg.
They're bringing him here,
I've sent for Doctor Forrest.
But you should send for a vet,
I can't have a lame dog here.
Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy.
Well then he ought to be taken to his mother.
His mother's dead, his father's in Northumberland.
Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him, won't you?
I told him I was sure you'd want us to have him here.
- You always want to help everybody.
- Come along.
I'm glad you brought him here.
- Let's get him to bed.
- It will hurt a bit, won't it?
I hope you don't think I'm a coward if
I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.
I don't want to cause you any more trouble.
Don't you worry, you're the one who's got the trouble.
We'd love to have you here, wouldn't we, Bobbie?
Yes.
That will be Doctor Forrest.
I'll go.
- That's not the doctor.
- I know.
I know that voice though, at least I think I do.
I thought I recognised it too.
It's not the doctor, that's for sure.
Could it be that Doctor Forrest has been attacked by highwaymen and left for dead and this is the man they've telegraphed
- to take his place?
- Perhaps he's gone mad.
Perhaps he's caught something awful from one of his patients and that man's come to tell her.
Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man up into Jim's bedroom.
Why should she?
Listen.
The door's opening.
Now they'll come down.
It's rude to listen like this.
It's not listening, nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs.
Bobbie?
A relative of Jim's has come, he wants to see you.
Wash your hands and faces.
We'll be in the dining room when you're ready.
Yes, Mama.
There now!
Fancy not thinking of that, hm?
- Any hot water, Mrs Viney?
- Righto love.
You all right?
There we are, that's it.
Well I never did!
This, my dears, is Jim's grandfather.
Our own old gentleman!
I'm so awfully glad it's you.
When I just think of all the old gentlemen there are in the world it could have been anyone.
You're not going to take
Jim away though, are you?
Not at present.
Your mother has most kindly consented to let him stay here.
I thought of sending a nurse but your mother said she'd nurse him herself.
But we won't have anything to eat if Mother doesn't write.
That's all right, Peter.
I see you trust your children.
- Of course.
- Then I may tell them our arrangement.
Sit down, my dears.
Your Mother, my dears, has consented to give up her writing for a while and to become a matron of my hospital.
Does that mean we'll have to leave
Three Chimneys and the railways?
No, no, my darling. No.
The hospital is here.
The Three Chimneys Hospital and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.
- Will Mother go on writing again?
- We shall see...
Perhaps something nice will happen and she won't have to.
- But I like my writing.
- I know.
Don't be afraid I'm going to try and interfere but one never know.
Very beautiful and wonderful things do happen, don't they?
And we live most of our lives in the hope of them.
I got your letter my dear, but it wasn't needed.
When I read about your father's case in the papers at the time I had my doubts.
And ever since I've known who you were,
I've been trying to find out things and I have hopes.
- Oh...
- Yes, I may say, great hopes.
But keep your secret for a little while longer.
Wouldn't do to upset your mother with a false hope, would it?
But it isn't false.
I know you can do it.
I knew you could when I wrote.
It isn't false hope, is it?
No, my dear.
You don't believe Daddy did it?
Oh, say you don't believe he did.
My dear, I'm perfectly certain he didn't.
'Life at Three Chimneys was never quite the same again
'after the old gentleman came to see us. '
Oh, please Phyllis.
'The house became a hospital. '
I give you three guesses who that is.
Is everything all right?
Good luck. I'll curtain up.
Have you...
Have you noticed the ship is sinking?
Yes I know, but don't blame me.
Oh, no!
Oh, no they'll all get so wet.
You'll need some light on the subject.
As your solicitor
I must advise you.
Don't worry.
Don't worry,
I've managed to get most of the survivors.
Right, curtain down.
Thank you, good evening.
I hope you enjoyed it.
Children, will you please be quiet.
Oh, the blood!
- Oh, is it over?
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Oh, you are a good doctor.
- Can I have that please?
There we are. How's that?
- Cheerio.
- Bye.
'Jim's leg got better and he went home. '
- Right away, Mr Mitchell.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, I'll write.
- Lor lummy, Pete!
- They'll have to marry now!
Lummy.
'We seemed to be hardly
Railway Children at all in those days
'and as the days went on each of us had an uneasy feeling about this
'which Phyllis expressed one day. '
I wonder if the railway misses us.
We never go and see it now.
It seems ungrateful.
We loved it so when we hadn't anyone to play with.
The thing I don't like is our having stopped waving to the 9:15 and sending our love to Father by it.
Let's begin again tomorrow.
Hurry up, Fatty, for goodness sake.
I can't, my bootlace is undone.
When you marry your laces will come undone going up the aisle and the man that you marry will tumble over and smash his nose in.
I'd rather marry a man with a smashed in nose than not marry at all.
- Take our love to Father!
- Take our love to Father!
Most extraordinary!
- Most extraordinary.
- Extraordinary indeed.
Now, Bobbie,
I wonder whether you could...
Don't you feel well?
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel...
Will you let me off lessons today?
I feel as if I want to be quite alone, by myself.
Of course I'll let you off.
What is it?
You don't feel ill, do you?
No, not ill.
I've just got to be alone, do you know?
Mm, sometimes Roberta, you're so like me.
I'll be more alive in the garden.
- Morning, Miss, I'm sure.
- Good luck, Miss Roberta.
Thank you.
Hello. Look, if this is the train, it'll be smart work.
Bless you. I seen it in the paper. I was never so pleased in all my born days.
One I most have and no offence I know on a day like this.
And one for luck.
You ain't offended, are you?
I haven't taken too great a liberty, have I, on a day like this, you know.
- No, Mr Perks, of course it's not a liberty.
- No.
Dear Mr Perks, we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of our own but on a day like what?
Well like this’ere. I told you,
I seen it in the papers, didn't I?
Saw what in the papers?
Oakworth!
Oakworth Station.
Oakworth. There we are.
Thank you, Madam.
Yes, thank you.
Quick as you can, please.
Oakworth Station.
- Right away, Mr Cryer.
- Thank you, Mr Perks.
Daddy, my Daddy!
'I think just now we're not wanted there.
'Not for a few minutes anyway.
'I think it would best for us to go quickly and quietly.
'We'll go to the end of the field among the thin gold spikes of grass.
'We may just take one last look over our shoulders, at the house
'where neither we nor anyone else is wanted now. '
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.
Hope you loved it.
Goodbye.
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
The year is 1929. The singer,
Cliff Edwards, also known as Ukulele Ike.
The film, Hollywood Revue.
It is the first all-talking...
...all-singing, all-dancing movie ever made.
Everyone from the place
Come on with your rain
I've got a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
In the years that followed,
"Singin' in the Rain" would become...
...a theme song for MGM.
Singin' in the rain
In the 1930s, Jimmy Durante gave us this rendition.
You wrote that this morning?
Yeah, it's something they'll remember.
Yeah, I remember it already.
I'm singin' in the rain
Oh, I'm singin' in the rain
What a grand, what a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
In the 1940s, Judy Garland did it her way.
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
I'm gettin' ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
And come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singin'
Singin'
I'm singin' in the rain
In the 1950s, Gene Kelly,
Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor...
...put it all together in what many folks would call the best musical ever made.
Singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin'
We're happy again
If you're wondering what happened in between, well...
...sit back and relax.
You're about to find out.
It's been quite some time since I first came to this place.
And MGM is certainly not the same studio...
...and Hollywood's not the same town.
But the films we made here are still around.
Some studios can claim they made the finest gangster films...
...or the greatest horror movies...
...but when it came to musicals,
MGM, they were the champions.
Musicals were fantasy trips for the audiences of their day.
For instance, boy meets girl, boy loses girl...
...boy sings a song and gets girl.
The plots were that simple.
The musicals of the 1930s, '40s, or even the '50s...
...may not tell you where our heads were at...
...but they tell you where our hearts were at.
And all of this lovable nonsense began back in 1929...
...when the silent film had suddenly become a thing of the past...
...and sound was the king.
Don't bring a frown to old Broadway
You've gotta clown on Broadway
Broadway Melody of 1929 won an Oscar for the Best Picture that year...
...and MGM was off and running with a new formula for success.
Charles King and a line of slightly overweight chorus girls...
...were the beginning of a new motion picture art form...
...that would captivate audiences for years to come.
No skies of gray
On the Great White Way
That's the Broadway Melody!
No skies of gray
On the Great White Way
That's the Broadway Melody!
Within a few short years, the musical had come of age.
The primitive stage show had now become a cinematic spectacular.
Here Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger,
Nelson Eddy and a cast of thousands...
...watched Eleanor Powell dance in Rosalie.
When I'm calling you
The most successful singing team in the history of motion pictures...
...Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in Rose-Marie.
Will you answer too?
- Then I will know
- Then I will know
- Our love
- Our love
- Will come true
- Will come true
- You'll belong to me
- You'll belong to me
- I'll belong
- I'll belong
- To you
- To you
In 1936, The Great Ziegfeld won an Oscar for Best Picture that year...
...and it's no wonder.
Virginia Bruce and a gang of lovely ladies...
...cluttered up
Hollywood's biggest staircase.
And somewhere in that lovely mob, you'll find Dennis Morgan singing a song.
If anyone could afford to film this extravagant number today...
...perhaps it would look something like this.
Just like a heavenly rhapsody
She captures you right from the start
Just like a beautiful melody
She'll play on the strings of your heart
A pretty girl
Is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain
Of a haunting refrain
She'll start upon a marathon
And run around your brain
You can't escape
She's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you
And then
- Come back again
- Will come back
A pretty girl
Is just like a pretty
Tune
She's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you
And then
Come back again
A pretty girl
Is just like a pretty tune
The last of the big black-and-white production numbers...
...starring Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire.
Cole Porter's music, the sets and the camera work...
...the direction by Norman Taurog, the incredible tap dancing by these two...
...well, it all seemed to come together in Broadway Melody of 1940.
You know, you can wait around and hope, but I'll tell you...
...you'll never see the likes of this again.
Don't be afraid
You'll make the grade
Why, you can sing
As good as Bing
And here, the old pro,
James Durante, gives a newcomer...
...a few pointers in It Happened in Brooklyn.
Sing it, Danny, make me proud.
Okay, Nick, stand back.
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Smile.
Long as it comes from the heart
Keep going.
It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Great.
Long as it comes from the heart
I'll give 'em that
I'll give 'em this
I'll strut away
Boy! You can't miss!
Just put a star on my chart
You won't need this anymore.
'Cause the song's gonna come
From the heart
Don't work cheap.
- On opening nights
- On opening nights
- Your name in lights
- Your name in lights
Why we won't stop
'Til you reach the top
- We'll order our meal à la carte
- We'll order our meal à la carte
- That's expensive!
- That's expensive!
- If the song comes from the heart
- If the song comes from the heart
We'll be tremendous!
- If the song comes from the heart
- If the song comes from the heart
They'll holler, "Bravo. "
- If the song
- If the song
- Comes from the heart
- Comes from the heart
- Heart
- Heart
That's just a sample of what's been going on around here for the past 40 years.
The work was hard, but it was great fun.
Because the people you worked with really knew what they were doing.
It was said that through those doors passed the most famous stars in Hollywood.
I don't think you'll find anyone around this town who will argue about it.
Here's one of the most lovely and talented of those stars...
...Miss Elizabeth Taylor.
I was 10 years old when I first came to MGM.
And I spent most of the next 18 years of my life...
...behind the walls of that studio.
As a young girl growing up in that strange place...
...it's hard to recall what was real and what wasn't.
Perhaps, my most vivid memories were of MGM musicals.
Just to stand there on the set and watch...
...the singing and the dancing.
It was like fantasy come true.
Total innocence. Loveliness.
I love a melody
Of spring
Lilacs in bloom
Birds on the wing
I made my musical debut when I was 15 years old...
...in a film called Cynthia.
I was certainly no threat to Jane Powell or Judy Garland...
...as you will see.
For life is an eager
Joyous thing
Whenever I hear
The music
Of
Spring
Maybe that experience helped give me...
...the enormous regard that I have for musical talent.
And believe me, at MGM, I saw the best.
HORNE
Every honeybee sighs with jealousy
For instance, if Lena Horne was in a movie...
...then it almost had to be from MGM.
Honeysuckle rose
When we're passin' by
Flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter
Goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweet when you stir it up
When I'm takin' sips
From your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips
You're confection
Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
- 'Cause it's one
- Two
- Three strikes, you're out
- Three strikes, you're out
- At the old ball game
- At the old ball game
When Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly teamed up for a series of films...
...the results were irresistible.
This is one of their best,
Take Me Out to the Ball Game.
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty?
Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me
Hear me holler
I choose a sweet lollapalooza in thee
June Allyson, MGM's most popular musical sweetheart...
...in Rodgers and Hart's Words and Music.
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
And thou swell
Thou witty, thou grand
Everybody's favorite college musical...
...Good News, starring June Allyson and Peter Lawford.
Those sure were the good old days.
The boy, "garçon"
His girl, "la fille"
That's good, "c'est bon"
The show, "fini"
The moral to this tale
Is not just "parlez-vous"
Send her a billet-doux
Tell her her eyes are blue
They sure are blue.
"Je vous adore" means
I love you
What wonderful years those were at MGM.
One day, I remember meeting a terribly handsome young man from England.
He'd just started work at the studio.
Naturally, I fell wildly in love with him.
I still adore him.
He's still one of my closest and dearest friends.
Peter Lawford.
This building, or what's left of it...
...was, among other things,
Tait College in Good News.
You might say that June Allyson,
Mel Tormé and I graduated from here.
We were all under contract to MGM in those days.
And the studio pretty much told us what pictures we were gonna appear in.
They put us in dramas, comedies and in my case...
...don't ask me why, an occasional musical.
As a singer or dancer, I was ill-equipped to compete with Astaire or Kelly...
...but we did what we were told to do.
When I first came to MGM, the world was at war.
To the Gls overseas and the audiences here at home...
...the musicals were a very special kind of escape...
...both during the war and sfterwards.
The films we made here had a certain style...
...a look that was unmistakable.
Whether it was the directing, or the writing, or the scenery...
...the costumes, the lighting,
I don't really know.
But somehow you could always tell that it was an MGM movie.
Especially the musicals.
All right, cut it.
- Print it, Jane.
- Okay.
All right, take me into number one.
Okay, number one.
Can you see your marks, Joe?
Okay, everybody.
- Quiet! We're rolling.
Speed. Action.
The studio was constantly experimenting...
...constantly showcasing new talent.
For instance, Debbie Reynolds and Carleton
Carpenter in Two Weeks with Love.
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a
Said the chimpy to the monk
Said the monkey to the chimp
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they were happy and gay
Swinging and singing
In a honky-tonky way
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a
Means, "Monk, I love but you"
"Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a" in monkey talk
Means, "Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon
They went upon their
Aba daba honeymoon
Elizabeth Taylor starred in A Date With Judy...
...one of the first in a new wave of teenage musicals...
...most of them produced by Joe Pasternak.
That isn't Elizabeth's voice you're hearing.
MGM kept her too busy to rehearse and record.
But her costar, Jane Powell, quickly became one of the studio's...
...most popular young talents.
As an old
Native-born
Californian would say
It's a most unusual day
There are people greeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
Here she comes!
Hey, Jim, you better get the rig
She's got a list of passengers
That's pretty big
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots of them been travelin'
For quite a spell
All the way to California
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe
The Harvey Girls, directed by George Sidney...
...starred Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.
And this Oscar-winning song was written by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.
In this day and age
Girls don't leave home
But if ya get a hankerin'
You wanna roam
Our advice to you is run away
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the
Santa Fe
All aboard!
We came across the country lickety-split
Rolling 90 miles an hour, fit to be tied
I can't believe I'm here at last
When you go traveling
It's natch for you
To take the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe
I can't believe that anything
Would go so fast
Then you pull that throttle
Whistle blows
A- huffin' and a-puffin'
And away she goes
All aboard for California
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison, Topeka

By the 1950s, the movie musical was reaching a level...
...of inventiveness and sophistication that was pretty hard to top...
...even by today's standards.
But it wasn't always like that.
And here's someone to tell you about it.
And he's pretty hard to top too.
Mr. James Stewart.
In the late 1920s and early '30s...
...these 200 acres of real estate were seeing a panic, pandemonium.
Sound pictures had replaced silent films virtually overnight.
The only actor in town that wasn't worried was Rin Tin Tin.
As long as he could bark, well, sound was no threat to him.
For MGM and the rest of Hollywood...
...there were gloomy days ahead.
Some of the biggest silent stars spoke with thick foreign accents.
Others had a lisp or talked through their noses.
The early microphones seemed to exaggerate the flaws...
...that silent film had hidden.
As quickly as the sound stages went up, careers collapsed.
The studio heads were desperate.
Where would the new stars, the new personalities come from, they wondered.
Well, the answer was obvious.
From the theater, from Broadway.
Theatrical experience suddenly became a passport to Hollywood...
...even if it meant no more than a few weeks of summer stock.
Over the next few years, a steady stream of hopefuls...
...marched through the gates of every studio in town, including MGM.
I should know, I was one of those hungry young actors from the East.
- Sam, is everything all right?
- Okay, Fred.
- How are the cameras?
- All right.
Bob, how are your lights?
All set, whenever you are.
Good. How's the music...?
Musicals were the most popular commodity in the early '30s.
And they were cranked out at an incredible rate.
Most of them really weren't very good.
But if audiences suffered, they didn't complain.
The real victims were the dramatic actors.
The studio pushed nearly every one of them into musical roles.
It must be you
Who carries me away
Here, an uncomfortable
Robert Montgomery tries his best.
But when you're near
The music in my soul
Would fade each time we part
Bob Montgomery was only one of many MGM contract players...
...forced to sing and dance.
In the frantic search for musical stars, many would be called...
...but few would succeed.
Here's one of my favorites.
And I know you all like her too.
Because she's the personification of youth...
...and beauty and joy and happiness,
Joan Crawford.
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody
Much as I love you?
Huh, did you?
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody
How about me too, huh?
Oh, my
You're the one I crave
I could be your slave
Honey, let me rave
Got a feelin' for you
Crazy about your smile
Hey, an easy style
Got it all the time
Got a feelin' for you
Like your turned-up nose
Like your knees down low
From your head to toe
Got a feelin' for you
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody
Much as I love you?
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody
Could you love me too?
You're the one I crave
I could be your slave
Honey, let me say
Got a feelin' for you
What'll you ever be?
What'll you ever do?
How'll you ever know
If you don't take a chance?
Jean Harlow, the blonde bombshell...
...tried out her musical abilities in Reckless.
I wanna live, love, learn a lot
I'll light my candle
And I'll burn a lot
You'll have some bad shots
Hard knocks
I'm on my own if I bruise
And there'll be smiles here
Shouts here
And I can take it on the chin if I lose
Because I'm reckless
Because she's reckless
Reckless
Because I'm reckless
I'm gonna go places
And look life in the face
Hey.
Did I remember
Jean Harlow's musical talents were somewhat limited...
...and the studio usually used someone else's voice for her vocals.
But in a movie called Suzy, her costar,
Cary Grant, did his own singing.
And darn well too.
How do you know?
You didn't hear it.
I assure you I heard every word.
Let me convince you.
Sit down. Gentlemen, play it again.
You be the audience.
Did I remember to tell you you're delightful?
You're everything I want you to be.
Your eyes look lovely
And far beyond comparing
Especially when they're glaring
At me
I can't think up words to say
How swell you are
But I can tell you are
I know so well you are
I started falling
The moment that I saw you
Believe me, I adore you
Chérie
I'm sure you'll hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For you'd be
So easy to love
I was lucky enough to sing a Cole Porter song...
...in Born to Dance with Eleanor Powell.
At first, the studio planned to have someone else record the vocal.
But the tune became such a big hit that they decided to let me do it.
You see...
...they figured the song was so good that even my singing couldn't hurt it.
We'd be so grand
At the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be, oh
So easy to love
I know that you'll join us in giving a really rousing, rip-roaring reception...
...to Harry Van and Les Blondes. Mr. Van.
Norma Shearer and Edward
Arnold looked on as Clark Gable...
...made his musical debut in Idiot's Delight.
Hello, people, and thanks a lot for that very lovely reception.
Thanks a million, and I won't settle for a cent less.
In our modest act tonight, we'll be ably assisted...
...by Professor Palova and his talented team. Give them a hand, folks.
Okey-dokey, fellas. Take it away.
- This will be amusing, Achille.
- I hope so.
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to
Why don't you go
Where Harlem sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled gowns upon the bevy
Of highbrows
But down the levee
All misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz
That's where each and every
Lulu Belle goes
Every Thursday evening
With her swell beaus
Rubbing elbows
Come with me and we'll attend
The jubilee
And see them spend
Their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Clark Gable surprised everyone with his delightfully corny routine.
And yet, his fans were just outraged...
...to see him even try singing and dancing.
Their hero was above such nonsense.
But it was perfectly all right for a youngster named Judy Garland...
...to dedicate a song to their idol.
Dear Mr. Gable
I am writing this to you
And I hope that you will read it
So you'll know
My heart beats like a hammer
And I stutter and I stammer
Every time I see you
At the picture show
I guess I'm just another fan of yours
And I thought I'd write
And tell you so
You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, sir
You made me feel so sad
You made me sigh 'cause
I didn't wanna tell you
I think you're grand
That's true
Yes, I do, 'deed I do
You know I do
I don't care what happens
Let the whole world stop
As far as I'm concerned
You'll always be the top
'Cause you know
You made me
Love you
"Dear Mr. Gable" was a milestone in its day.
It was the first time a studio permitted a song to be dedicated to one of its stars.
And it was sung by a little girl...
...who would soon become
MGM's newest star.
And here's someone who can tell you more about that remarkable talent.
He's a remarkable talent himself.
Mickey Rooney.
This is Carvel Street.
For anyone who's ever seen an Andy Hardy movie...
...well, this is where they were all shot, right here.
Over there, that was
Polly Benedict's home across the street.
And this was the home of the Hardy family.
The picket fence is gone, and the mailbox too...
...but it's still the Hardy home.
It might seem strange that a person could spend over 20 years...
...growing up on the same movie set.
But in a way, that's what happened to me.
I was about 10 years old when I first came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer...
...and I was raring to go.
The movie was Broadway to Hollywood.
And you guessed it, it was a musical.
Well, we... We all change a little over the years, don't we?
You know, when you've been raised at a studio, the way I was...
...you learn a certain ability that time can't seem to erase.
You learn to recognize real talent.
You see so many people come and go...
...that when an exceptional talent comes along...
...it seems to stick out like a sore thumb.
I was a seasoned veteran of 17 when I first had the opportunity...
...of working with the great and wonderful Judy Garland.
I knew when I saw her standing before the camera...
...that she had that certain magic.
Her talent seemed to jump right off the screen at you.
Do re mi fa so la ti do
Judy and I became close friends when we did a series of films together...
...that the studio called
"backyard musicals. "
Audiences seemed to love the pictures...
...even though the plots were suspiciously alike.
Only our names seemed to change.
How do you do?
Good morning. I'm Betsy Booth.
- I sing, you know.
- I know, I heard you.
You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?
This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.
Danny, this is my grandchild,
Ms. Ginger Gray.
- Yes, we've met.
- This is my cousin, Ms. Polly Williams.
Mr. Daniel Churchill, a junior.
Ms. Barton, this is Ms. Essex, the once famous "Baby Rosalie. "
How do you do? This is Mickey Moran.
How do you do?
My name's Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?
- I don't think I like you.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- I want success.
- And you'll have it.
I know you will, Mickey. Just think when our names are up in electric lights.
You the big composer and producer, and me the singing star.
We could have our own great modern dance orchestra.
We've got everything we need here.
We've got the brass...
...the piano and the reeds.
We can make our own arrangements, specialties and play for all the dances.
We've gotta have a great show with a million laughs.
And color, a lot of lights to make it sparkle.
And songs, wonderful songs with you out there selling them.
It'll be wonderful.
Say, that's not a bad idea.
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.
Why, it looks as if you'll need a whole city block.
Yeah. Sure, that's it.
Right in the neighborhood, and everybody'll come to it.
A Western rodeo, once a year we'll bring back the West.
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James, Buffalo Bill.
- A hundred beautiful girls.
- On horseback.
- Glorious costumes, happy, carefree.
- Gay!
I'm gonna write a show for us right here in Seaport.
It'd be the most up-to-date thing these hicks around here have seen.
Opening night, we'll have
Max Gordon and Sam Harris...
...down to give us the once-over.
How about it, kids?
- They call us babes in arms
- We never dance
- They think they must direct us
- But no chance
- But if we're babes in arms
- High romance
- We'll make them all respect us
- Why, oh, why
Why have we got our arms
What have we got our sight for?
Play day is done
We've a place in the sun
We must fight for
When our movies took off at the box office...
...we found our budgets taking off too.
So they moved Judy and I out of the backyard and into the barn...
...then to the high school gym...
...and later to a Broadway stage that would never have fit in a real theater.
Where we got all that energy,
I'll never know.
But a lot of it was inspired by our director, a genius...
...Busby Berkeley.
Small town
Living in a small town
When you're in a small town
You gotta make friends
- One, two, three
- One, two, three
Watch them shuffling along
See them shuffling along
Go take your best gal
Your real pal
Go down on the levee
I said to the levee
And we'll join that shuffling throng
Hear that music and song
It's simply great, mate
Waitin' on the levee
Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee
We're babes on Broadway
We're goin' places
When our new faces appear
It's a wonderful street
For babes like us to be on
We're here because
We want our names in neon
We left Topeka
We left Eureka
And came to seek a career
Oh, we're milkin' applause
Instead of milkin' a cow
'Cause we're babes on Broadway now
With our flag unfurled
We can face the world
Hey, leader
Strike up the band
There's another fellow who worked on this lot with Judy...
...and some of MGM's best musicals...
...are a direct result of his considerable talents.
Gene Kelly.
This is MGM's New York street.
And for as long as I can remember...
...this has been the busiest standing set on the whole backlot.
Any actor or actress...
...who made more than one or two films at this studio...
...sooner or later probably would find himself shooting a sequence here.
Which reminds me, if you're a song-and-dance man...
...and you've spent some time in pictures...
...inevitably, some interviewer will ask:
"Who was your favorite dancing partner?
Was it Rita Hayworth, or Vera-Ellen, or Leslie Caron?"
But if you're smart, you'll never give them a straight answer.
I'm gonna break that rule right now.
It may not be gallant...
...but I'd like to show you the greatest partner I've ever danced with.
When you dance with Fred Astaire, you really have to be on your toes.
This number from Ziegfeld Follies...
...was the only time we've had a chance to work together.
But I'd change my name to Ginger if we could do it again.
Fred Astaire has been the tops...
...in every field of show business he ever entered.
And the motion-picture musical owes him a great deal.
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no
They can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no
They can't take that away from me
When he starred in a series of musicals with Ginger Rogers...
...they quickly became the most popular dance team...
...in the history of motion pictures.
But for Fred, as an individual...
...it was only the beginning of a screen career...
...that would delight several generations of moviegoers.
Stand up and sing
We've got the gang together
We always sang together
Stand up and sing
Over the years,
Fred Astaire's trademark would become...
...the top hat and tails.
He wore the outfit in his very first film appearance...
...Dancing Lady with Joan Crawford.
I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized
There'd be another man
Jack Buchanan, the debonair British musical star...
...joined Fred in The Band Wagon.
Until the big affair began
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf
And that was that
I tried to reach the moon
But when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I've lost the one girl I'd found
But besides elegance, there's a lot more to the Astaire style.
Fred was constantly striving for perfection.
Rehearsing hour sfter hour...
...searching for a new step or a new device...
...that would bring something fresh to each of his numbers.
Because of his ingenuity and precision...
...audiences never realized how much incredible effort...
...Fred poured into his work.
He made it all appear so easy.
In Royal Wedding,
Fred danced with a hat rack.
And as usual, he made his partner look good.
In The Barkleys of Broadway...
...Fred and choreographer Hermes Pan...
...conceived the brilliant
"Shoes With Wings On" number.
Fred and director Stanley Donen...
...collaborated on this mind-boggling routine from Royal Wedding.
Movie buffs are still arguing about how it was done.
The gimmicks Fred used were exciting and fun.
But his talents were so extraordinary...
...that he could easily get along without them.
This is the Astaire I love to watch.
With a lovely partner like Cyd Charisse...
...a simple settiing...
...a marvelous song by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz...
...these are the only ingredients
Fred would need...
...to create a classic moment.
"Dancing in the Dark" from The Band Wagon.
Fred Astaire was and is a unique talent.
There'll never be another like him...
...and that's what I love about our profession.
Because every so often an artist comes along...
...who's impossible to compare with anyone else.
Here's another of my favorite dancing partners...
...Donald O'Connor.
MGM seemed to acquire talent the way you and I pick up paper clips...
...by the handful.
When I was at the studio...
...we were up to our ears in tenors, baritones, tap dancers, pianists...
...and they were all good.
But this set belonged pretty much to one star...
...and one star alone.
I only wish we'd had a chance to work together.
Well, she was not only a lovely actress, with a beautiful face and figure...
...but she could also sing and dance, and even handle comedy.
And if that wasn't enough, she was dynamite in the water.
Of course I'm talking about
Ms. Esther Williams.
A champion swimmer...
...Esther was working as a model in a Los Angeles department store...
...when MGM talent scouts discovered her.
The studio built a special swimming pool for her on the backlot...
...and starred her in a film called
Bathing Beauty.
The rest is history.
MGM featured Esther in a series of spectacular productions.
During her career, she swam...
...opposite some of MGM's most popular leading men.
Some of them even got their hair wet.
Like Howard Keel...
...Fernando Lamas, whom she would later marry...
...Van Johnson...
...Peter Lawford...
...Ricardo Montalban...
...even Tom and Jerry.
Jimmy Durante...
...and Red Skelton.
As her fame grew...
...so did the size and population of her swimming pools.
Esther no longer could simply climb up a diving board and jump in.
Now, she had to be presented like Venus...
...rising from the sea.
In the ranks of great musical stars, there have been singers, dancers...
...musicians, even ice skaters.
But MGM saw to it there was only one Esther Williams.
Eat your heart out, Mark Spitz.
People say that performers are overly affectionate with one another.
And that may be true.
I don't have to apologize for the way I feel...
...about a young lady that I worked with here at MGM.
I love her.
And she's as big a hit right now on Broadway...
...as she was here in Hollywood.
She never stops.
Miss Debbie Reynolds.
I made my first movie for MGM back in 1950.
Remember Three Little Words?
Hey, fellas, can we borrow your piano just a minute?
Of course, the real stars were
Fred Astaire and Red Skelton...
...but see that funny-looking kid coming down the steps?
Look out, Hollywood. Here I come.
I wanna be loved by you alone
Boop-boop-bee-doo
I wanna be loved by you
Just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone
Carleton Carpenter and I only did this one number in the picture.
But it certainly helped our careers.
Even though the voice wasn't mine...
...MGM brought in the song's originator,
Helen Kane, to sing the vocal.
And make you my own
Bap-bap-bee-dap
Boop-boop-ba-doo
I wanna be loved by you
Just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Bap-bap-bee-dap-bee-dap-bee-dap
Boop-boop-ba-doo
When I first reported at the studio...
...MGM was celebrating its 25th anniversary.
They had converted the biggest sound stage on the lot into a restaurant.
They only served one meal, but it was a lunch that old-timers still talk about.
The studio used to boast that it had more stars than there are in the heavens.
And that day, they weren't kidding.
The first time I met the king,
Clark Gable...
...he looked down at me and said,
"Hello, beautiful. "
And I nearly fainted.
This place was the land of giants, and I was a small fry.
But like any other young hopeful,
I was determined...
...that somehow and someday
I'd measure up.
In the early 1950s...
...MGM was entering a new era of motion pictures...
...with more star power...
...than virtually every other studio in Hollywood combined.
I've gotta hear that beat
I've gotta hear those drums
And even when it comes to romance
When I feel that I might fall
I always stall and play it smart
Till I hear that beat
I've gotta hear that beat
That certain beat in my heart
Ann Miller, the best tap-dancing lady on the lot.
Annie's talents and Busby Berkeley's imaginative direction...
...were a perfect combination in Small Town Girl.
Be my love
For no one else can...
A truck driver from Philadelphia became the most sensational new voice...
...in motion pictures.
Mario Lanza. He made only a few films.
And The Toast of New Orleans with Kathryn Grayson was one of his best.
Just fill my arms
The way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire
With every sweet desire
Be my love
And with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand
We'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me
Eternally
If you will be
My love
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Everyone wants to laugh
Donald O'Connor in Singin' in the Rain...
...in my opinion, the funniest musical number ever done.
They'll be standin' in lines
For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines
Or you could study Shakespeare
And be quite elite
And you can charm the critics
And have nothin' to eat
Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Everyone wants to laugh
My grandpa said
Go out and tell 'em a joke
But give it plenty of hoke
Make 'em roar, make 'em scream
Take a fall, butt a wall, split a seam
You start off by pretending
You're a dancer with grace
You wiggle 'till they're giggling
All over the place
And then you get a great big
Custard pie in the face
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you... All the...
My dad...
They'll be standing in lines
For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Make 'em laugh

For to tell the truth
I do
Ol' man tiver
That ol' man river
He must know somethin'
But don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin'
Along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
You get a little drunk
And you land in
Jail
I gets weary
And sick of trying
I'm tired of living
And scared of dying
But ol' man river
He just keeps rolling
Along
I'll go my way by myself
Like a bird on the wing
I remember something else
I learned at the studio...
...during my stay there. MGM's motto:
"Do it big, do it right, and give it class. "
I'd like you to meet someone who certainly measures up to that phrase.
He's the classiest gentleman
I've ever worked with.
Mr. Fred Astaire.
I'm by myself
Alone
I have a great many fond memories about this place.
So many happy moments worrying about whether or not...
...we were getting the job done.
What fun.
We shot some of The Band Wagon here.
Being here again brings to mind some of the wonderful people...
...I've worked with over the years.
One of them in particular...
...is my long-time friend...
...Gene Kelly.
In The Pirate with the Nicholas Brothers...
...Gene displayed the rough-and-tumble kind of acrobatic dancing...
...that quickly became a popular part of his repertoire.
From the start,
Gene was constantly experimenting...
...from classical ballet to a burlesque buck-and-wing.
He was determined to broaden the horizons of the film musical.
And in doing so, he became one of the most versatile...
...and original performers the movies have ever known.
Kelly was forever breaking rules.
Though the studio often tried to stop him...
...Gene insisted on doing his own stunts.
His bosses always seemed to find out about it sfter the scene had been shot.
But audiences loved the sight of Gene himself...
...flying through the air in film sfter film.
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
In On the Town with Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin...
...Manhattan became the backdrop for this unforgettable romp.
A tribute to Gene's persistence...
...it was the first major musical to be filmed on location.
The famous places to visit are so many
Or so the guidebooks say
I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any
But we got just one day
Gotta see the whole town
Right from Yonkers on down to the bay
In just one day
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
Manhattan women are all in silk and satin
Or so the fellas say
There's just one thing necessary
In Manhattan
When you got just one day
Gotta pick up a date, maybe seven or eight
On your way
In just one day
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
I've had a lot of partners in my day.
But can you imagine a grown man dancing with a mouse?
Well, Gene did just that in Anchors Aweigh.
His dancing partner was Jerry the Mouse of Tom and Jerry fame.
Critics said it was the most effective use of live and animation technique...
...ever put on film.
And I certainly agree.
Look at me. I'm dancing.
More than any other star, I think
Gene Kelly became the symbol...
...of the MGM musical of the 1950s.
And here's a classic routine that audiences would never forget.
This is my favorite number from one of his very best musicals...
...Singin' in the Rain.
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin'
Singin' in the rain
Dancin' in the rain
I'm happy again
I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain
I'm dancin' and singin'
In the rain
The finale to the Broadway ballet from Singin' in the Rain...
...seems to me to exemplify the genius of Gene Kelly.
Actor, singer, dancer, choreographer and director.
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
That's the Broadway
Melody
You've seen Gene Kelly's work on the screen.
I think I've said it all.
He's one of those rare talents who really understands...
...what the movie musical is all about.
Now I'd like you to meet someone that recently joined the gang.
If Hollywood breeding could be compared to royalty...
...then she would certainly be our crown princess.
I remember so well when she, as a tiny little girl...
...used to sit on the set watching her father, Vincente Minnelli...
...directing me in several pictures.
Her mother, the fabulous Judy Garland.
Yet this young lady has made it all on her own. Yes, she has.
Miss Liza Minnelli.
The first studio I'd ever been inside was MGM.
I can't really say that I grew up here.
But I know that for over 10 years,
I'd race like crazy after school...
...to get down here and visit whatever set my parents were on.
You may not know this...
...but I made my film debut at MGM.
MINNELLl: In the very last shot for
The Good Old Summertime...
...they needed a little girl to play the daughter...
...of Van Johnson and Mama.
Guess who got the part.
There she is, folks. What personality.
No wonder I didn't get any billing.
It's no wonder this place will always be a part of me.
My father directed dozens of films here...
...and Mama, well, this was her home for over 15 years...
...and 30 films.
It began in 1935.
MINNELLl:
In an MGM musical short...
...a vaudeville team called the Gumm Sisters...
...made their first appearance on film.
Twelve-year-old Frances was the standout...
...and talent scouts from MGM decided to give her a chance.
But first they changed her name from Frances Gumm to Judy Garland.
The studio put Mom in another short subject.
This time they paired her off with a young operatic singer named...
...Deanna Durbin.
These musical shorts were like a screen test.
In those days, if you came across in a two-reeler...
...you just might have a chance in a real musical.
Swing
North, south, east, west
Just swing
You'll find that swing is best
Swing
Make it a national thing
You'll find
There is a chance for romance
Here on the dance floor, so dance
Dance, dance, dance
America
MINNELLl: Although MGM would drop
Deanna Durbin...
...some executives at the studio pleaded to keep my mother under contract.
And they finally won.
Well, they kept her at MGM just barely.
She spent the next few years in low-budget musicals.
Once in a while, she'd appear as a sort of novelty act...
...in a big extravaganza like the Broadway Melody of 1938...
...with Buddy Ebsen.
Mama once told me...
...MGM seemed obsessed with Shirley Temple.
They even offered 20th Century Fox
Jean Harlow and Clark Gable...
...just to get Temple for a certain picture
Metro was preparing.
But the deal fell through.
So MGM finally went ahead with the picture...
...and let Mama play the role of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
You're off to see the wizard
The wonderful wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was
The wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandelion
A fate I don't deserve
I'd be brave as a blizzard
I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a Wizard
Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
- A heart
- A home
The nerve
MINNELLl:
The Wizard of Oz finally did it for Mama.
With Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr...
...she really started off on the road to success.
Whatever rocks or bumps there were in that road...
...she never let it show in her films.
For Mama, it was straight up all the way.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more skies of gray
Than any Russian play
Could guarantee
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings
From the moment I saw him, I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump
Went my heartstrings
When he smiled
I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat and took a seat
He said he hoped
He hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak
Because he scared me half to death
Howdy Doody!
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Flop, flop, flop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
As he started to go
Then I started to know
How it feels
When the universe reels
If you like-a me, like I like-a you
And we like-a both the same
I like-a say this very day
I like-a change your name
'Cause I love-a you and love-a you true
And if you-a love-a me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the bamboo tree
How can I ignore
The boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me
Glance his way
MINNELLl: Summer Stock was Mama's final film for MGM.
Her last days of shooting here were devoted to this number...
...which a lot of people including myself feel was one of her very best.
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
We're going to the promised land
We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
Chase your cares away
Hallelujah
Get happy
Before the judgment day
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy

Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
We're going to be going to the promised land
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready
For the judgment day
Thank God for film.
It can capture a performance and hold it right there forever.
And if anyone says to you,
"Who was he?" or "Who was she?"
Or "What made them so good?"
I think a piece of film answers that question better than any words I know of.
My generation...
Well, we're just beginning.
It takes a lot of film and a lot of experience...
...and a lot of talent to become a real star.
Now here's somebody who I think qualifies on all of those counts. Oh, boy.
Mr. Bing Crosby.
You know, one sound stage, well, it looks pretty much like another.
But a backlot, out here where they shoot the exteriors...
...that seems to me that the backlot reflects the personality...
...the character of its studio.
This was the biggest...
...and I think, perhaps, the best backlot in all of Hollywood.
Of course the old backlot looks a little shabby right now, sort of scruffy...
...kind of an illusion on an illusion...
...but that's because most Hollywood filmmakers...
...they don't use backlots any more.
They prefer the real thing.
Hollywood
Hollywood
I remember when I did my first musical at this studio...
...they designed a big production number.
It was all to take place in a vast Manhattan railroad terminal.
Of course we didn't bother to go to New York City.
MGM simply recreated
Grand Central Station...
...added a couple of thousand extras and filmed the whole number right here.
Once again
Goodbye, pal
Out where they say
Let us be gay
I'm going Hollywood
I'll ballyhoo greetings to you
I'm going Hollywood
Say, while you sleepyheads
Are in that hay
I'll be dancing
I'm gonna be dancing
With a sun-kissed baby
And I'm on my way
Here's my beret
I'm going Hollywood
Well, it was vigorous. Spirited, anyhow.
I was, what you might call, a casual participant in MGM musicals...
...because over 20 years went by...
...between the little effort which you've just seen...
...and my next attempt.
And I found fantastic changes had occurred.
They had color, oh, stereophonic sound, even wide screens.
And MGM, in a loose moment, had decided to give me another chance...
...in a little pastiche to be called High Society.
This starred Grace Kelly, Louis Armstrong, and Celeste Holm...
...and was directed by Chuck Walters.
Oh, yes, there was another featured performer in there.
What was his name?
A brash young newcomer. Frank, uh...
A clever kid.
He had a lot to offer too. Frank, uh...
Well, you'll recognize him when you see the footage.
Have you heard about dear Blanche?
- Got run down by an avalanche
- No.
Don't worry, she's a game girl, you know.
Got up and finished fourth.
- Kid's got guts.
- Having a nice time?
Grab a line.
- Have you heard that Mimsie Starr
- What now?
- She got pinched in the Astor Bar
- Sauced again, eh?
She was stoned.
- Well, did you ever?
- Never.
What a swell party this is
- I'm gonna have a drink.
- I may have a bit of the bubbly myself.
- I'm gonna dance.
- Don't get hurt.
Oh, no.
- It's great
- It's great
- It's grand
- So grand
It's wonderland
- We sing
- We sing
- So rare
- So rare
Like old Camembert
Like baba au rhum
Don't dig that kinda croonin', chum
You must be one of the newer fellas.
Have you heard?
It's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party
Swell party
Swellegant, elegant party
This is
While I give to you
And you give to me
True love
So on and on
It'll always be
True love
For you and I
Have a guardian angel
On high
With nothing to do
But to give to you
And to give to me
Love forever
True
Love forever
True
I'm recalling times when I was falling
Like a free jubilee day
Get this cast:
Russ Tamblyn, Vic Damone,
Tony Martin...
...Kay Armen, Debbie Reynolds,
Jane Powell, Ann Miller...
...and the Pacific Fleet...
...in Hit the Deck.
Sing hallelujah, hallelujah
And you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue ya
Hallelujah
Gets you thru the darkest day
Satan lies a-waitin'
- And creatin' skies of gray
- Skies of gray
But hallelujah, hallelujah
Helps to shoo the clouds away
Satan lies a-waitin'
- And creatin' skies of gray
- Hallelu
But hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Helps to shoo the clouds away
Sing hallelu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lujah
The next time anyone says that dancing is for sissies...
...remind them of
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
Produced by Jack Cummings, directed by Stanley Donen...
...and choreographed by Michael Kidd...
...it's perhaps the most vivid and exuberant ballet ever put on film.
Gigi
Am I a fool without a mind
Or have I merely been too blind to realize
Oh, Gigi
Why you've been growing up
Before my eyes
Gigi
You're not at all
That funny awkward little girl
I knew
Oh, no
Overnight there's been
A breathless change
In you
One of the finest musicals ever made...
...Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's Gigi.
It was that rare blend of story and song...
...and it starred Leslie Caron,
Louis Jourdan, Hermione Gingold...
...and the marvelous Maurice Chevalier.
All under the inspired direction of Vincente Minnelli.
- May I come in?
- Yes.
Gaston, please.
No newspapers, no scandal.
Madame, will you do me the honor...
...the favor...
...give me the infinite joy of bestowing on me...
...Gigi's hand in marriage.
Thank heaven.
For little girls
For little girls get bigger every day
Thank heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you crashin'
Through the ceiling
Thank heaven for little girls
Thank heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who
Without them, what would little boys do?
- Thank heaven
- Thank heaven
Thank heaven
For little girls
Through the years, MGM has produced over 200 musical films.
And if you had to select one number from one film...
...that would best represent the MGM musicals...
...I have a feeling that the vote would be unanimous...
...especially among the people who worked here...
...and that's why we've saved the best for the last.
An American in Paris, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.
It won an Oscar as best picture of the year...
...over 20 years ago.
But the ballet from that film...
...is as timeless as the day you and I first saw it.
Produced by Arthur Freed, directed by Vincente Minnelli...
...and choreographed by Gene Kelly...
...it can only be described as MGM's masterpiece.

Nice going, Charlie Brown.
I took that rock 4,000 years to get to shore, and now you've thrown it back.
Everything I do makes me feel guilty.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
You know, kid.
You and I make a great pair.
It‘s nice to lie in the sun and just do nothing.
Of course, it's better if you're with someone you like.
You kind of like me, don‘t you, Snoopy?
Why don‘t we meet here again tomorrow?
If you‘ll come,
I'll bring a picnic lunch.
We'll have sandwiches, cookies and lemonade and potato chips and everything, okay?
And we‘ll build another sand castle.
Only this time, we'll build an even bigger one.
We'll have a great time.
Will you come?
Good. I'll see you tomorrow.
[DICE RATTLING]
I wonder where Snoopy is.
I've got Boardwalk and Park Place.
I'm going to destroy you economically,
Charlie Brown.
I'll never give up.
I have a philosophy that tells me, no matter how bad things get, they will always turn out good in the end.
That's not a philosophy, that's stupidity.
CHARLIE:
Seven.
Go directly to jail.
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
Good grief.
When you get out of jail,
Charlie Brown, you‘re gonna land on my Boardwalk or Park Place, and then you'll be destroyed.
Ha! Twelve, doubles.
That means I get another turn.
Oh, no, not on Pacific!
With hotels!
Pay me $1,275, please.
Schroeder. Schroeder.
How about a beep on the nose?
- A what?
- Beep.
A beep on the nose is a sign of great affection.
I'd rather have the $1,275, please.
- Pay up.
- But I haven't got $1,275.
If you can't pay up, then I guess you're bankrupt.
LUCY: I am not bankrupt.
- It's almost dark.
Snoopy isn‘t home yet.
I wonder where that dog is.
There he is.
I wonder where he‘s been all day.
What an independent dog.
He comes and goes as he pleases.
But I have to stay home and fix his supper.
Ow! Ow! Ow.
Rats!
All right, it's supper time.
Come and get your supper.
Do you see this finger?
I cut it opening a stupid can of dog food for your stupid supper.
I hope you appreciate it.
Besides that, it wasn't a finger, it was my thumb.
You've been acting awfully independent lately.
Don't forget that I'm the one who feeds you.
I'm the one who takes care of you.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Without me, you'd be nothing.
Everything you have, you have because of me.
Even that collar around your neck.
Why, I remember the day I went out and bought that collar with money I had worked for and had saved and...
I hate it when he does that.

Charlie Brown?
"Dear Snoopy, I have been in the hospital for three weeks, and I am very lonely.
Could you come to see me?
Love, Lila."
Lila? Who in the world is Lila?
If I don't find out who Lila is,

[CAR VROOMS]

Why would Snoopy go to Lila?
Maybe Snoopy felt he needed a vacation.

Boring? What was I supposed to do?

What do other dog owners do?
I never thought of myself as being a dog owner.
Snoopy was more like a friend.

I've seen people get sick on merry-go-rounds and Ferris wheels and roller coasters, but you‘re the first person
I've ever seen who got sick going through the turnstile.
Hey, look at that, Chuck.
Come on, let's go!
[CHARLIE GRUNTING]
We‘re having a good time, aren't we, Chuck?
I love this kind of life. I like action.
I'm a moving-type person.
When nothing is moving,
I feel low.
That's why I always keep moving.
Does your kind ever think about love, Chuck?
- What do you mean, my kind?
- I'm sorry.
I didn‘t mean to put it that way.
No offense.
I apologize. Friends?
You touched my hand, Chuck.
Hey, look here, a fortune-telling machine.
Let‘s get our fortune told, Chuck.
Maybe we can find out something about ourselves.
PEPPERMINT PATTY [READING]:
CHARLIE [READING]:
You kind of like being with me, don't you, Chuck?
What do you think love is, Chuck?
Well, years ago, my dad owned a black 1934 two-door sedan.
- What's that got to do with love?
- Well, this is what he told me.
There was this real cute girl, see?
She used to go for rides with him in his car, and whenever he'd call for her, he would always hold open the car door for her.
After she got in and he had closed the door, he'd walk around the back of the car, to the driver's side.
But before he could get there, she would reach over and press the button, locking him out.
Then, she'd just sit there and wrinkle her nose and grin at him.
That's what I think love is.
Sometimes
I wonder about you, Chuck.

Snoopy!
I knew you'd come.
[SIGHS]
Hi, Chuck. Any news from old Snoop?
No. No news.
He's never been gone this long before.
You've got to agree, he's gone because of me.
Maybe I came on too strong for him.
Right after our fight, he kissed me and I fainted.
I think, he thinks, I think there's something wrong with him.
He wanted my blanket,
I wouldn‘t let go.
He left because I was hostile and unkind to him.
I made him feel unwanted, like he was a pest.
Now I'm going out of my mind for him.
- Do you think pets are important?
- Sure.
A friend of mine at school got some goldfish for his birthday.
- I don't think he really wanted them.
-Hmm.
How did you happen to get Snoopy,
Charlie Brown?
Well, I'm not quite sure because I was kind of young.
I think it started because of something that happened at a playground.
I was playing in the sandbox with a couple of other kids.
I can‘t even remember who they were.
Anyway, all of a sudden, one of them poured a whole bucket of sand over my head.
I started crying... I guess.
And my mother came running up and took me home.
It's kind of embarrassing now to talk about it.
Anyway, the next day we drove out to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, and my mother and dad bought me a dog.
People buy pets for strange reasons.
[SIGHS]
I just don't know what to do, Linus.
If I don't find out what happened to Snoopy,
I think I'll go out of my mind.
If you‘ll calm down for a minute,
Charlie Brown,
I may be able to conduct a little private investigation.
Just what I need, a blanket-carrying Sherlock Holmes.
I wonder if it would help to call the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.
They might know something about him that we don‘t know.
I don't understand it.
Every morning I brought him a toasted English muffin with grape jelly on it.
Sometimes at noon,
I'd even fix him a nice salad.
He wrote all those letters to the editor.
Why doesn't he write me a letter?
Snoopy, come home!
I'm feeling so much better now that you‘re here.
I hope I can go home soon.
[DOOR OPENS]
Thank you, nurse. Thank you.
[DOOR CLOSES
AND SNOOPY SIGHS]
I'm feeling better every day.
Perhaps soon, we can go home.
[SNOOPY GULPS]
I know that when my mother sees how you‘ve made me well, she'll let me take you home with me.
I'll keep you with me forever.
What's the matter, Snoopy?
You do want to go home with me, don't you?
[SOBBING]
You poor dear.
You're homesick, aren't you?
But we'll be good for each other.
Hello? Hello, Humane Society?
I'm calling about this lost dog, you see.
Describe him?
I don't know how to describe him.
He's just a stupid beagle!
I've had it!
Let old wishy-washy Charlie Brown find his dog himself.
Hello, Daisy Hill Puppy Farm?
I'm calling in regard to a dog named Snoopy.
Uh-huh.
That's right. Charlie Brown.
Uh-huh. Oh.
Really?
Wow. I'll bet he never knew that.
That explains a lot of things.
[PANTING]
Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown!
Charlie Brown!
I have news about Snoopy.
All right, tell me, what happened?
If you don‘t tell me what happened to Snoopy, I'll go crazy.
The first thing I did in my investigation was to call the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.
I found out something that will amaze you.
In fact, I hesitate to tell you.
Are you ready for a shock?
He wasn't ready for a shock.
How can I tell you something that will shock you if you pass out before I can tell you?
I'm sorry.
I've been hyperventilating a lot lately.
Well, anyway.
Here's what I found out when I called the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.
You are not Snoopy's original owner.
Oh, good grief.
You bought Snoopy in the month of October, right?
According to the records at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm,
Snoopy was bought by another family in August.
This family had a little girl named Lila.
Snoopy and Lila loved each other very much, but they had to move and the family decided they just couldn't keep Snoopy.
So they returned him.
You got a used dog, Charlie Brown.
- So that's why Snoopy left.
- Sure.
He had tried to forget her all these years.
But when he found out she was in the hospital, he ran off to see her.
I‘ll bet he wishes he was still her dog instead of mine.
- That's funny.
WOODSTOCK: Hee-hee.
Well, Snoopy, this is our last day together.
What are we going to do?
You're coming to visit me saved me.
Are you sure you don‘t want to come home with me?
It's up to you, Snoopy.
You can go to your other owner if you want to, but I wish you'd come home with me.
[SOBS]
Snoopy.
Oh, I'm so glad you came back.
This means you want to come and live with me, doesn't it?
Why don't you go back home.
Maybe you could settle your affairs.
You could say goodbye to all of your old friends, then you could come and meet me at my house.
Now, promise me you'll hurry back.
After this, you'll never leave again.
Promise me.
Hurry back, honey.
[TYPEWRITER CLICKING]
Hey, you‘re back.
I heard about Lila.
Did you see her?
Was she well?
Where did you stay all the time you were gone?
Was Lila nice to you?
Why didn't you write?
Are you hungry? Are you well?
Can I do anything for you?
I'm not getting any answers.
I can't stand it!
What's this?
"I, Snoopy, being of sound mind, do bequeath to Charlie Brown, my previous owner--"
Previous owner?
"--my best wishes for the future.
My treasured belongings will be given to my friends as follows."
What's going on here?
Why do you mean by all this?
"My croquet set I leave to Linus, as well as the chess set.
My record collection
I place in the capable hands of Schroeder.
Carpeting and rest of the furnishings to my favorite charity, the American Humane Association.
Thus, with the settling of my affair,
I return to Lila who needs me."
[PLAYING JAUNTY TUN E]
We are gathered together at this farewell party to pay tribute and say goodbye to a very close friend.
Perhaps I could persuade some of you to say a few words.
Lucy?
With a heavy heart
I stand before you as we all gather to say our last goodbyes to Snoopy.
He leaves us in the prime of his life.
[SOBBING]
He wasn't much of a dog, but who is?
We shall miss our furry friend.
So at this time I want to offer this gesture of friendship.
A little gift for old times' sake.
[SOBS]
Farewell, Snoopy.
Next, I would like to call on Schroeder.
Well, first I would like to thank
Snoopy for the record albums.
And for the many great times we have had together.
[SOBBING]
Here, Snoopy, a little token of my friendship.
And now a word from Snoopy's ex-owner, Charlie Brown.
[GULPS]
[WAILING]
[WAILS]
Snoopy, with a heavy heart and all the best wishes...
...this present.
Goodbye, Snoopy.
I'm sorry to see you go, Snoopy.
I'm sorry we never caught any rabbits.

Someone would leave.
Someone always leaves.
And then we’d have to say goodbye.
I hate goodbyes.
[SIGHS]
You know what I need?
I need more hellos.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Snoopy, you finally got here.
We‘ve been expecting you.
Our whole family is eager to see you again.
And I can hardly wait to have you meet my cat.
You'll just love each other.
He's the sweetest thing.
I must be cracking up.
I can't sleep, and today
I even opened a can of dog food and took it out to the doghouse before I remembered he was gone.
I guess we all miss Snoopy.
I hope he's happy with Lila.
[BOTH SIGH]
Have you ever thought of getting another dog, Charlie Brown?
No, never again.
I don‘t ever want to go through such an ordeal again.

Lose or win, sink or swim

We’re the best of buddies
We ‚re the best of buddies

[SNAPPING]
Look at this, Charlie Brown.
"To Linus Van Pelt,
I expect my croquet set and chess set returned forthwith in good order and within five days, or the matter will be turned over to my attorney."
And mine says, he wants the record collection back.
Mine says that since he gave me nothing, I owe him nothing.
That does it, Charlie Brown!
He's your dog and you're welcome to him.
Hey, Phones, good morning.
Hey, what's happening, buddy?
Let's go skate, come on.
Hey, Bobby.
Look, it's Jumping Jack Flash!
- It's Conway!
- Oh, no!
Hang on!
- Good morning, Ada.
- Good morning, Terry.
- Is everyone up yet?
- In the dining room.
Eggs soft enough, Roger?
Good morning, lovey. Drink your juice.
Well, I thought I'd go down to the beach today and commit suicide.
That's nice, lovey. Have a good day.
Well, if anybody wants me,
I'll be at the city morgue.
Kids.
Let's go.
You and your fads, Terry.
Honestly, roller skating?
Next thing, you'll have me surfing, or some such horrendous thing.
You'd rather not go?
Not after I bought my skate bag at Gucci's.
Okay, thank you.
Have a nice day. Stay off the bike path.
- How you doing, Phones?
- Okay.
- You need these?
- No.
Have a nice day. We'll see you later, okay?
- Listen. This is great! This is bad!
- Hey, Phones. What's happening, man?
You're looking fantastic for the Roller Boogie contest.
Bobby, why don't you come and skate with us, okay?
- Baby, I gotta work.
- Come on, please? Just for a little while.
- Skate with us.
- Please?
All right. I'll be back. Take care of the place.
Come on, man. Do it!
Come on, Bobby!
- You're next.
- I don't think so.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.
Your money or your life, twinkle boots.
Yeah, how'd you like your neck permanent waved?
He's turning blue, homeboy.
He's turning blue!
Sorry, Bobby.
The guy's working out.
Here's yours.
You guys know that girl?
You mean, "Don't touch me, you brute?"
Yeah, I just saw her pull in in a million-dollar car... over at the parking lot.
Probably some rink skater from Beverly Hills.
No, man.
No rinks in Beverly Hills, just minks.
Come on, forget it, Bobby.
She is way out of your league, man.
My Franklin, your Theresa.
Our two geniuses.
So we thought about London or the Paris Conservatory... but we accepted the Juilliard scholarship... because we could just hop over, stay in the Hamptons--
- And shopping in Manhattan.
- Lillian, please, I'm talking.
Then, we could see Theresa, be back here in no time at all.
Actually, I think New York would be good for her.
A more mature attitude toward her music and all that, you know.
Sitting on the lap of creativity.
I'm sorry, he put his hands on...
I mean, it was an accident. I'm sorry.
- Franklin, take those off!
- In the house.
Franklin, I swear!
You have more hands than a poker game!
Going slumming at the beach again?
Your mother thinks you're going out with me.
Franklin, I'm not in the mood for octopus rally!
Terry, I need you.
Your body is driving me crazy.
Franklin, Barbie dolls drive you crazy.
- You're oversexed.
- Come on, Terry.
Franklin, stop it!
Terry, give me back that towel.
Terry, I'm sorry. Please, come on.
My mother's inside.
So what? It's not that big a thing, anyway.
Terry, come on. Come back!
Bye.
Terry, come back!
Mother.
- And he is the best we got.
- Excuse me.
- You guys, look here.
- Excuse me.
It's the golden girls of Beverly Hills.
How's old Bev Hills these days?
- Let me help you.
- All right, a telephone, man!
Give me Alaska.
Let me get your bag for you, okay?
Here you go.
How you doing?
My name is Gordo, remember me?
How you doing?
Hope you have a good time skating.
Excuse me, Miss Buns.
Come on, will you, Bobby.
Come on, look at her car, man.
Look at her car, then look at yourself.
That's three things that don't match: this car, you, and that chick.
I'm telling you, man.
I got $5 says she'll skate with me tonight.
You do? $5? You're on, sucker.
- Here's mine.
- What is this?
That's my IOU. I'm good for it.
Come on, let's go.
Hey! Are you crazy?
What was that?
That was Complete Control Conway, the one-man destruction derby.
- Lovely. I'm fine, thank you.
- You sure are.
- You can let go now.
- I know that.
- Would you do it?
- Not until you say you'll skate with me.
Hey, I saved your life.
You're the best skater on the boardwalk, true?
I don't know. I do okay.
I need someone to teach me how to dance on skates.
I'll pay you $10 an hour.
Here's $5 in advance. I'm gonna freshen up.
You ain't skating with her yet.
Say, look, you!
- Yes?
- Something about this isn't right.
Hey, wait up!
Sorry, ladies.
Okay, everybody, it's time to play.
It is couples-only time. Couples only.
Come on, this is a good song.
It's almost over.
What's your name, anyway?
Did you see me in that commercial?
I'll bet you can't skate, anyway.
Ready?
This is all screwed up.
I'm supposed to ask you if you wanna skate.
- Okay, ask.
- Do you wanna skate or something?
Sure, I wanna skate or something.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
What are you, a prejudiced person?
Let's go out there and dance a little.
You don't want to dance with me?
You win, sucker. There.
Don't get scared.
I'm gonna show you something.
Just relax and stay loose.
All right, it's time to get on down with a new sound. Here we go.
I think it's your wheel.
Bobby, you clown. You know that music hurts my poor old ears.
- Terry Barkley, Jammer Delany.
- Hi.
Hello, love.
- My God, but you sure are pretty.
- Thank you.
- Anything she needs, I'm good for it.
- Okay.
Did you know
Jam was eight-time National Champion?
Fastest man through the pack on skates.
That was until they took my knee cap apart in six places.
Boy, I'm telling you, skating's changed a lot since I was a top jammer.
I'm sure it has.
- You got a wrench?
- I think so.
Good.
- Here we go.
- All right, thanks a lot, Jammer.
You're welcome, Bobby.
- Enjoy yourself now, love.
- I shall. Thank you.
Wrong one.
Top jammer?
You know, Roller Derby.
Sure, my parents watch it every night on TV.
Okay.
This one's just as nice as the other one.
Hey, Terry, wait up.
Wait up!
Thanks for skating with me, kid.
We still have 45 minutes left.
And my name ain't "Kid," it's Bobby.
- Bobby James.
- Keep the change, Bobby James.
Terry, will there be anything else?
- No thanks, Ada. My folks come home yet?
- Child, didn't they tell you?
They went to the Palm Springs house for the weekend.
I forgot.
Listen, I can stay over if you don't want to be alone.
No, it's okay. You go on home.
I'll be fine, thank you.
All right, dear.
Last time my mama went to Palm Springs, she came home with a new papa.
- Now she's in Mexico, dear thing.
- Doing what, pray tell?
Getting rid of my new papa.
Then it's back to the Springs for another try.
My parents don't have to tell me where they're going.
Why should I tell them where I'm going, right?
Where are you going?
Crazy! Anybody wanna come?
She's off to the beach again.
Her choice of friends leaves something to be desired.
She picked you, didn't she?
Franklin, you nerd! You ruined my nails!
Okay, put another 20 pounds on that, boy.
Another 20 pounds, Master Hoppy?
Why, sure enough, sir!
Coming right on up here.
Okay, now.
I got it!
Okay.
I think he's got it!
How long have we had this chest pain, my boy?
- Get it off, you pinheads!
- Watch out.
What the hell do you think you're doing, man?
These guys.
We're going to the pier later.
You wanna come?
I gotta practice.
Come on, man.
There's a new waitress at Casa Cucaracha.
- She wants your body anytime, day or night.
- She said she loved Olympic skaters.
- She did not.
- Did, too.
I got one hour of workout, two hours practice.
- You know my routine.
- All right, give it a break, man.
- Let's go find some women.
- I'll see you later.
- Come on!
- Don't be a drag!
Get off my case!
My time is my own, you get it?
No Olympic judge is gonna vote for a turkey boardwalk skater.
That waitress... is she a real fox?
- Yeah, a fox, man.
- That chick's uglier than her enchiladas.
Rich chicks, gold medals, Olympics...
Always wants something he can't have.
You're gonna regret this in the morning.
They're just your parents, Barkley.
They're not supposed to understand.
I don't give a damn if they don't have time for me anymore.
I'm a big girl, right?
Who needs to know where they're going or when they'll be back.
They don't owe me anything.
Your mother brings you a new father when she comes home.
That's something, at least.
You are acting so childish.
Our little genius is throwing a temper tantrum.
When are you gonna come back?
I'll be back when I get here.
- Let's go.
- Oh, it's you.
- You still owe me 45 minutes.
- You got a mental problem or something?
You wanna skate, and then you don't wanna skate.
What is it with you?
- I was watching you. You're very good.
- I know that.
Well, excuse me if you don't have time.
Sit down. I'll be just a minute.
If that was meant to impress me, it did.
You're very good.
You should do something with that talent.
The Olympics will be around soon.
The Olympics? That's a lot to bite off.
- I got a big appetite.
- I guess you do.
Okay, let's do it!
- Are we gonna do it right here?
- Anywhere you want to.
You don't waste any time, do you?
- I was talking about skating.
- Sure you were.
Is that one of your better moves?
Where is she? This really gripes me.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
I just don't understand you.
You coming on so strong and all.
What do you want from me?
What does any woman want from a man?
Look, you're not no bimbo from the boardwalk.
Are you sure you wanna do it?
I don't believe you just said that.
I don't believe I said it, either.
You're not figuring on paying me for this, too, are you?
What in the hell was that for?
I mean, you started it!
Because I didn't plan to be seduced on the beach!
You just wanna forget about the whole thing?
I just wanted someone to hold me.
Was that too much to ask for?
Terry, wait up.
Where have you been?
We've been looking everywhere.
When are you gonna give up this tacky scene?
- What's wrong?
- Fella, I don't know who you are... or what you are, but I don't like the look of this, understand?
Get your hands off me!
Look, fella, I said--
Just marvelous!
Now how are we gonna get home?
My humble chariot at your service, madam.
May I recommend a passion fruit?
Come on, right this way.
I think he broke my nose.
Let's just get you to the hospital then.
Hey, you.
Taking the kook to the hospital room!
Yeah, and then to Lana's.
What's the matter, lovey?
Why are you sitting on the stairs?
Franklin Potter breaking your heart?
I'll have a talk with his mother.
- Do you love me?
- What a question to ask.
- What about Daddy?
- Lovey, where is all this going?
At the end of summer, I go to school.
When I come back, I'll be a woman.
- Yes, but--
- I never had a chance to be young!
Lovey, you are different.
Even your father doesn't understand how you do those things with music.
So what? I'm a musical genius.
What a drag! What a bummer!
Drag? Bummer?
Lovey, you're giving your mother a migraine.
Diet pills... sleeping pills, diuretics, Quaaludes...
Valium, there you are.
If I'm old enough to be on my own... then I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
I do not wanna play the flute.
I do not wanna go to Juilliard.
I do not wanna be paired off with Franklin Potter.
He is a lecherous jackass!
And I never wanna hear another string quartet again in my life!
Now that we know what you don't want... what is it that you do?
For now...
I wanna win a Roller Boogie contest down at the beach.
A Roller Boogie contest?
I'm sure that you'll accomplish whatever you put your mind to.
I mean, you always do.
I have to meet your father for lunch... and we'll talk. We'll see.
She didn't understand a thing I said.
Hello?
Lady, this is a pay phone.
You want me to look where?
All right, just a minute.
- You Bobby James?
- Yeah.
- It's for you.
- For me?
He'll be here in a minute.
Hello?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, yourself. Who is this?
Terry Barkley. Remember me?
Sure, I remember you. Why'd you run away?
How'd that guy know that was me in the window?
I love your outfit.
Centerfold of Playgirl?
Come on, Terry, this is really weird.
Blue shorts, how cute.
Come on. Where are you?
The parking lot.
How about breakfast?
On me.
Sure.
Why do you keep staring at me like that?
- Like what?
- Like you're trying to read my mind.
I wished I could.
You're dealing with something heavy, right?
It's all right. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
Yeah, like running away from home, and running away from me.
You're handling it just great.
I'm sorry I slapped you and ran away.
I was being a real bitch.
And you were handy.
I'd still like you to teach me to skate.
Same price?
$25 an hour.
All right.
- Sorry I asked.
If I teach you to skate, it's because I want to.
You get it?
I'll call the shots. Whatever I say, goes.
I'm not interested in your money.
- Deal?
- Deal.
Lillian, where the hell are you?
I'm a basket case, and you're getting a touchup?
All right, I'm sorry.
Look, if she's still in Los Angeles, we'll find her, okay?
All right, now you just tip Mr. Upjohn, or whoever's doing you... and come home.
Lillian, I love her, too.
What I want you to do is something like this.
You know keep your arms like that, then twist something like that.
Okay, let's see.
Okay, come on.
Okay, now come out of it.
That's good. That's real good.
Come around here and get both your hands here.
Turn your body and twist it, okay?
Come straight down.
One, two...
One, two, three.
I got an idea.
Let's try another trick.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
Wait, I got it.
Am I getting better?
No.
- That was good, Terry. All right.
- Wait! How do I stop?
Okay, Terry, watch.
You're looking good.
You are. You look nice. Yeah, you do.
- You planned that.
- I sure did.
Let's call it quits.
You know, things are beginning to make a lot of sense.
I can't explain it, but I think you had a lot to do with it.
You learn really fast.
How long have you been skating?
- Three weeks.
- Come on, really?
Really, I was an ice skater for years.
I won medals. Watch.
I was only 6 years old.
Come on, let's have some fun.
- Let's Cunga!
- Cunga!
Okay, my children,
J.D. is gonna take care of you once again.
We have more music at Jammer's.
Are you ready?
- What's happening, man?
- She lost her lock, man.
Wait a minute.
I think I got some in here somewhere.
Jammer's got some upstairs. Come up there.
At great inconvenience... you force me to make certain facts perfectly clear.
Am I making myself perfectly clear?
It's up here somewhere.
This place is not for sale.
We don't need another shopping mall down here.
You're the last merchant to hold out, Delany.
There's a lot of important money at stake down here.
That means big investors.
You can't stop progress.
Get out of my office.
Something's going down in there.
Some good advice:
You take the money and run.
Personally, I abhor violence.
Anything can happen, Delany.
Your insurance rating is already in the danger zone.
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.
One can never tell about accidents.
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.
Let's go.
Oh, God, I've never been so scared.
The piece that dude had had gotta be 2 feet long.
You guys, wait here.
Come on, Jammer, open up!
Damn!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm thinking.
Why don't we find the others and put our heads together?
Let's go. Come on.
- Have you guys seen Terry Barkley?
- Nope.
So how you doing there, Twin Peaks?
Ready for some mountain climbing?
Terry had a really bad scene at home, and I think she might have run away.
- Did you check the bus station?
- The bus station? Please.
We'll just have to stroll along the beach until she's found.
Until she's safe in the arms of her loved ones.
We won't skate, we won't sleep, we won't eat.
- We won't eat?
- We won't eat.
Onward!
- Jammer, man, what's happening?
- Get out of the way.
Everybody out.
Jammer, you're drunk.
Damn it, didn't you hear me?
I said, everybody out! It's all over.
I'm closing this place down for good.
- I'm sorry, kids.
- Wanna drink?
I'm awful sorry.
- All right, so where are they?
- I don't know. We've looked everywhere.
Hey, C.C. What's going on, man?
Jammer closed down the rink.
He's acting crazy.
- Closed down the rink? What the hell for?
- I don't know.
- Hey, listen, you guys
- Barkley!
Look, where have you guys been?
And what's going on over at Jammer's?
Here's the deal.
We got two goons and a twerpy guy with a $600 suit on.
They want Jammer to sign the contract or they'll torch the place.
They don't even care if we're in there or not.
What about Sgt. Banner'?
He's always been straight with the boardwalk scene, right?
No cop's gonna arrest a guy with a $600 suit on.
Even if they did, there wouldn't be enough rink left to fill a shoebox.
- What about the Boogie Contest?
- Yeah, what about it?
Jammer did it for us.
He did it so no one would get hurt.
What Jammer needs is a good shyster.
Barkley's father is a shyster.
I mean, a lawyer.
- Yeah, that's right, Terry.
- Come on, help us out.
Wait, you don't know my father.
Look, I'm the runaway.
Please?
Okay, I'll do it. I'm in trouble anyway, right?
- All right!
- Great.
Captain? Yeah, this is Roger Barkley again.
I know it's late, but have you heard anything at all?
I can't stand it anymore.
Listen, she'll come along.
You know how kids are nowadays.
She's just blowing off steam.
Hi, remember me?
Thank you.
Now, before I turn you over to your father... is there anything you wanna tell me?
Pregnant?
- Mother, I've been gone overnight!
- How long does it take these days?
Ms. Barkley, I don't believe you!
All right, go on. Go see your father.
All right, thank you.
Hi, Daddy.
You finally remembered your address.
Daddy, I know it's not the right time, but I need to talk to you.
I have been worried sick, young lady.
All this talk about nobody loving you.
It's the skating, isn't it?
It's that insane disco music thing.
You're an artist, a musical genius.
And I'm not gonna have my daughter...
You do that again, I'll...
You get some sleep. Tomorrow's a big day.
Everybody will be there:
-the Music Society, the Philharmonic Club.
- I know, Daddy, but I need to ask a favor.
As long as it's not about skating or disco music.
Lillian, shut up.
Anything, sweetheart, you just name it.
I've got some friends and they need some legal advice really bad.
Have them call me at the office on Monday.
Could they call tomorrow?
I won't ask for anything else after that.
Why not invite them here?
I mean, I'm sure your father can talk to them after the recital.
For once, Lillian, you're right. Okay.
Honey, any friends of yours are friends of mine, okay?
Sweet dreams.
Look at these houses.
- Whoa, man! I wonder who lives there.
- I don't know. Probably some royal people.
You guys, behave yourselves at this party, okay?
Don't worry, I got class.
Yeah, and everything I know,
I learned from him.
- British soldiers?
- This is valet parking, dummy.
Get that heap out of here.
Deliveries are around the back.
- How about I deliver you?
- Come on, Hoppy, cool it.
Check your list for
"Robert James and friends."
Right through there.
Yeah, and don't scratch the paint, my man.
- Your wrap, sir.
- Rap?
I got no time to rap, Chief.
Catch me later, okay?
Hey, look! A grass party.
- Cut it out.
- Don't hit him.
Hey, cut it out! Act like you belong.
- Behave yourself.
- I'm well-behaved.
- Do you care for an hors d'oeuvre?
- Don't mind if I do.
- Finger sandwiches, my favorite food!
- Hey, get your own, lady!
Did you see what he did?
Give me one of those things.
You guys, a little food?
- Look at this.
- Cafeteria.
- I can't find her.
- You will. She's around.
Save some for somebody else, would you?
How nice of you to come.
Look what you made me do.
I lost my horse doovers.
Those are the guys.
- What guys?
- The guys in the skating rink.
- Where?
- Over there.
- Is Roger here?
- He's up with the musicians.
He's a little nervous, but he'll be all right.
I better get going. I'll see you later.
Sunny, those kids at the table... they were at the roller rink the other day.
Find out why they're here.
Don't cause any trouble.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.
Thank you for coming to the final assembly... of the Barkley Baroque Society.
This will be our last formal recital for our daughter, Theresa.
She has been accepted to the Juilliard School of Music... as an Honor Student.
Gentlemen, would you take your seats?
Thank you.
And now, without further ado... the Barkley String Ensemble... featuring flautist, Theresa Barkley.
Wow, look at her, Phones.
-Isn't she beautiful?
- Come on, man, let's go.
Excuse me. Sorry, lady.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Get out of my lap!
Jeez, HOPPY-
Breathe through your nose, Mother.
Roger, do something!
- Roger, help me.
- Throw me a rope.
- Throw me anything.
- Here.
Get your hand under her. Push up.
Push her up, Franklin! Come on.
Come on.
Let's go! Over there.
Go around and cut them off.
Let me explain.
I'm sorry.
Let's get out of here.
Bobby, come on!
Roger, do something.
- Daddy, I--
- Roger, she was trying to tell you--
Lillian, shut up.
This lunacy. Those people in my home.
It's my home, as well, and you invited them here.
And Mr. Thatcher, our client-attorney relationship nearly ruined... because of your incredible accusations.
To say nothing of a $10 million redevelopment investment... now in jeopardy because of my daughter's harebrained scheme... to help all the unwashed in this world.
You are never to see those people again.
Did you hear that?
Daddy, I heard him threaten to burn down the roller rink... if Mr. Delany wouldn't sell.
My friends heard him, as well.
Impossible to raise children these days, Roger.
Young lady, I want an immediate apology to Mr. Thatcher.
What, you're gonna take his word over mine?
This is not a game.
Now, Theresa, the apology. Right now.
No! I'm not a child to be ordered to apologize to a thief and a liar!
Lovey, wait!
Sorry, kid, I went to Jammer's myself.
He's not pressing charges.
And the deal is legal.
He signed the contracts this afternoon.
Thanks, Danner.
It was really straight of you.
Yeah. Well, that's progress, kid.
- At least Jammer will do okay.
- Yeah, that's for sure.
- Man, he copped out on us.
- What's one more sell-out?
- Shut up!
- Phones is out of a job.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
None of you do.
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I bet.
What's your problem, man?
You got to take a nap in your little baby carriage?
Bobby, come on, give us some slack, will you, man?
- Did you get a hold of Terry?
- Not even her maid would talk to me.
Well, maybe it's for the best, man.
I mean, maybe she was too rich for your blood, you know?
Who's that?
It's all over.
But you're gonna be the greatest, Bobby.
The greatest.
I'd like to dedicate this next number to Jammer Delany.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just thought you might come here.
It's all over. Jammer signed the contract.
You won't need to learn your moves since there won't be a contest.
You can tell your father that I won't be messing up his daughter's life anymore.
What the hell! Can you imagine?
What a pair.
I love you.
Dear Bobby, my parents have decided to send me back East...
to stay with an aunt, before I start Juilliard.
Before I go, I had to tell you that you're something really special.
I love you, Bobby James.
With all my heart, Terry.
- Mr. Thatcher?
- What is it?
This is Nick.
I got the kid marked, down by the water.
Stay with him.
How's it going, Bob?
How you doing, Bobby?
- What's going on, man?
- Where's Phones?
I don't know. He gave Hoppy his noise and said the world stinks. That's all I heard.
The guy's never gonna skate or listen to boogie music ever again.
Oh, no, there he is!
Can you believe it?
Crazy old Phones, man.
The guy was always recording something on this thing.
There's a lot of important money at stake down here.
- Hey, wait a minute, what is this?
- Turn it up.
Anything can happen, Delany.
Your insurance rating is already in the danger zone.
Do you believe that stuff?
Might even be full of kids.
One can never tell about accidents.
Consider my offer.
We got them! Damn, we really got them!
Phones left his tape player on and didn't even know it.
Give me the tape.
- What have we got?
- Evidence. We can kill the deal.
But who's gonna believe us?
Those guys got all the money in the world.
Hoppy, give me the keys to your old man's truck.
Okay, man, but don't eat any of those Puerto Rican guavas.
Tell Phones to throw away the robe.
Spread the word that the Boogie contest is on tonight. Let's go.
- All right!
- Big Boogie's on, man!
Put me through to Thatcher. This is Sunny.
- I think we got some trouble on this end.
- It's time to act.
God, I hate scenes like this.
Give me another tissue, Barkley.
Barkley, you're so immature.
What are you gonna do without me in New York?
I'll call home and ask for advice for the lovelorn.
Give her a month in Manhattan, she'll be giving you advice.
What does he want?
Bobby, what are you doing here?
- Let's go.
- Shall I call the police?
No, Bobby, wait.
I got all the evidence against Thatcher on Phones' tape player.
My parents will be here... What tape?
I've had just about enough of you, fella.
- Come on, let's go. I'll tell you on the way.
- Let me out!
Wait a minute. lam not leaving her alone for a moment.
Terry, come on. I'll get you for this, Bobby!
Let me out of here!
Terry, somebody, help me.
Help, Terry! Anybody, come on. Let me out!
Let me out of here!
- Come on, Jammer, don't split, man.
- We're not afraid of those guys.
- We can lick those dudes, man.
- Come on, Jammer, stay.
The tape can prove they threatened you.
All we have to do is get Sgt. Danner to listen.
- Yeah, man, it was corrosion!
- What he means is "coercion."
How will one more night hurt?
Then you can do what you want.
Everybody's been practicing all year to get ready for this thing.
Come on, Jammer, just let us hold the contest tonight.
Listen to me, all of you.
If you think that I can live with the idea... that one of you kids might get hurt by a gang of money-hungry goons... then you're in for another think!
No, sir. Not me!
I can't stand that responsibility.
I'm off to Arizona to watch the cactus grow.
That'll take forever.
So long, gang-
I'm gonna miss you all. Take care of him.
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- So long, Jammer.
Don't drink on the road.
Oh, God, I can't stand it.
I can't stand looking at your hound-dog faces.
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can use the rink tonight for one more time!
One more time!
- Hey, Boss!
- Who's that?
There's Thatcher!
C.C., go to the Boardwalk, find Danner, tell him to go to the rink, okay?
Tell everybody that the contest is on tonight.
Okay, we'll meet you there.
When we get to them, spread out.
I want that tape.
- Let's get the goons with the fruit!
- Get the fruit!
- Hold them up. See you at the rink.
- Good luck, man.
Take off your skirt.
Let's get out of here.
There goes the Barkley girl. Let's cut her off.
- Now what?
- Take my hand and follow me.
It's easy for you to say.
You're headed for the Olympics.
I'm headed for broken bones.
Come on!
- Here they come!
- Come on, let's go!
Hurry UP!
Come on, move it, Sunny!
Just stay with them.
Watch out!
Head them off at the next street.
Jump it!
Get after them!
- Down here!
- Down there?
Let's go.
Let's split up.
Watch it!
All right, man. Give me five!
Hey, watch it, man!
- I think we lost them.
- Yeah, that's just great.
I don't know. I don't see them.
- See them?
- Nothing.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hey, wait a minute. There they are!
Just wait a minute.
They probably skated back to the rink.
Let's try there.
Let's catch a free ride.
Get your head down. Don't let them see you.
There they are.
- I don't know where they are.
- Here they are! Right there.
Are you all right?
- I got it.
- Hey, watch it.
Freeze!
All right, Thatcher, all right now.
I'll make you a deal.
You let the kids hold their contest... and right after it the rink is all yours, okay?
Shut up, Delany.
Chump!
- Give me the tape, kid.
- Give it to him, Bobby.
Thanks.
You want it? Come and get it.
Get the tape.
- Grab the gun!
- Keep them down.
What is this? Some new disco dance?
- Why don't you just play the tape?
- Play the tape!
All right, all right!
You listen to me.
Now, you listen to me good.
This is an infringement of my legal right, and I want my lawyer.
I want my lawyer now!
Mr. Thatcher, here I am.
Sorry it took me so long to get down here.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
We'll discuss this later, young lady.
I want my client's immediate release from this travesty of justice.
This is an illegal kangaroo court.
It has no bearing or standard in this contractual dispute.
Play the tape.
Thatcher Industries is the sole owner of this property.
All legal papers have been filed and so noted.
And everyone on these premises is violating the trespass law.
The deed has been registered and recorded in and for the county of--
There's a lot of important money at stake down here.
Big money means big investors.
Turn that off! That's inadmissible evidence!
- Get out of my office.
Shut up.
Anything can happen, Delany.
Your insurance rating is already in the danger zone.
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.
One can never tell about accidents.
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.
What the hell do I pay you for?
Say something.
Well, I think that we have a clear-cut case here, Mr. Thatcher.
No doubt about it.
There's every indication that the contract... between Mr. Delany and Thatcher Industries is... in my professional opinion, unequivocally and totally... invalid.
All right, children, this is the time we've been waiting for:
the big Boogie contest!
Okay, that's it. No more calls.
We do have a winner.
Contestants, come forward, please.
For being more than just the best dancers...
for bringing inspiration and the true spirit of music...
the Roller Boogie grand award goes to:
Terry and Bobby.
Bobby, Terry's coming, man.
- You guys, let's split.
- Okay.
That time already?
I wanted you to have this.
My place is too small.
Why don't you keep it?
There's no room in the suitcase.
Do you have my new address?
Yeah, I got it.
You got mine?
It's in my flute case, so I'll see it all the time.
You're gonna be big, Bobby James.
I'll read about you in the papers someday:
"Famous skater wins gold medal."
Sure. Might even get to New York sometime.
You never know.
Never know.
Bye.
{3122}{3206}Come on in.|Over here.

{8464}{8558}- Where are we?|- In mom's spare bedroom.
{8560}{8640}No, where in the world|are we?
{8642}{8699}Oh, well we're on kauai.
{8701}{8785}- What's that?|- One of the islands the sandwich islands.
{8831}{8883}How far is that from texas?
{8885}{8941}Oh. Well, to tell you the truth,
{8943}{8989}I don't think you can|get there from here.
{8990}{9039}At all?
{9041}{9112}I went to honolulu|once, though.
{9113}{9161}It's not as bad as my son says.
{9162}{9210}Well,|good morning, ma'am.
{9212}{9261}Honolulu's a couple|day's sail from here.
{9262}{9313}Are you feeling better?
{9315}{9375}Well, i'm beginning|to make some recovery.|Yes, ma'am.
{9377}{9467}And you, young man, you're not|even supposed to be here. Now scoot.
{9469}{9524}I was just trying to help.
{9525}{9575}If you really|mean that, son,
{9577}{9657}I could use some shavin' soap|and straight razor,
{9659}{9717}To kinda get out|from underneath this.
{9719}{9776}Can he use dad's razor, mama?
{9811}{9943}Well, not if your man feels|strongly about it. Some do.
{9975}{10029}My husband passed away|two years ago.
{10030}{10086}Oh, i'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.
{10088}{10142}You know where|your father's things are.
{10237}{10296}I'm henrietta Macavoy.
{10297}{10354}I'm pleased|to meet you, ma'am.
{10356}{10413}You're lucky to survive,|you know.
{10414}{10507}Well, you can't drown if you|was meant for something worse.
{10509}{10590}It's just a figure of speech.
{10592}{10671}Just that, me and the sea,|we don't get along together.
{10673}{10742}Oh, then you did|come off a ship?
{10772}{10837}Come off? Yes ma'am,|i think that's right.
{10838}{10885}I just wish i'd never got on it.
{10886}{10976}You're not a deserter?
{11014}{11115}As the lord as my witness,|ma'am, i am a wronged man.
{11116}{11180}That may be, mr.--
{11182}{11256}Ah, Costain.|Lincoln Costain.
{11257}{11304}My friends call me linc.
{11306}{11380}Mr. Costain,
{11381}{11427}I suggest as soon|as you're well enough,
{11428}{11480}You get yourself back to your ship.
{11481}{11564}Get back?|I was shanghaied, ma'am.
{11634}{11696}Morning, boss.|You're looking handsome already.
{11697}{11779}Liliha make you some good soup.|Fix your body up proper.
{11780}{11836}Just what might|that be, ma'am?
{11837}{11909}Make this from raw fish, some|lizard powder and dried squid.
{11911}{11960}She said it would|put hair on my chest,
{11961}{12024}But all it did was make me gag|'til my eyes watered.
{12025}{12089}Booton, behave yourself.
{12123}{12173}If it's all the same|to you, miss lili--
{12175}{12260}Liliha. You take some.|Go ahead.
{12349}{12464}- You like, no?|- No, that's pretty bad,|that is.
{12466}{12546}Actually, i'm not very hungry. If i could|just have my pants so i could get up.
{12548}{12622}Your pants were so badly torn,|we had to mend them.
{12624}{12709}Mom, they're in the garden|again, tearing up everything!
{12764}{12834}What is it?|What is it, boy?|What's the matter?
{12836}{12927}It's one of the animals. A big one.|He's eating up the vegetables again.
{13038}{13084}Get out of here!
{13086}{13142}Get out of my garden, you hear me!
{13144}{13190}You get out!|Get!
{13191}{13239}One of the animals?|Well, i'll be dogged.
{13240}{13292}You didn't tell me you had|cattle around here, button.
{13294}{13362}- Liliha!|- Booton!
{13363}{13423}We don't, that thing's wild. But|i sure hope he eats the turnips.
{13424}{13504}Well, he may be wild,|but he ain't no thing.
{13506}{13583}That's about a thousand|pounds of prime bull out there.
{13584}{13667}You stubborn,|willful, worthless,
{13668}{13741}Misbegotten beast!
{13743}{13798}That's a right nice|vocabulary, miss Macavoy,
{13799}{13855}But you'll never|talk him out of there.
{14214}{14272}Look at it.|Just look at it.
{14494}{14574}- Is this soup?|- Soup!
{14753}{14829}- Oh, hi, Costain.|- Howdy, barton.
{14831}{14886}Booton!
{14888}{14971}Look what i got for you.
{14973}{15087}That's right nice of you, son, but i'm|not real hungry just now. I just ate.
{15089}{15176}No, it ain't to eat. It's a|real hawaiian hat. For you.
{15179}{15226}Do you like it?
{15227}{15325}Like it?|Yeah, yeah, it's, uh--
{15326}{15374}It's real colorful, ain't it?
{15375}{15434}Make you look|real pretty, boss.
{15436}{15492}Put it on. It'll be great.
{15494}{15574}Well, it's just|a little more decorated|than what i had in mind.
{15575}{15665}That's all right. Make you|look real hawaiian style.
{15791}{15873}That really is quite|becoming, you know.
{15874}{15934}It's time to go into town, Booton.
{15935}{15983}I don't think i'll|go in today, mom.
{15985}{16039}I've got some things i've been|planning to do around here.
{16094}{16210}Well, all right. You be sure and|make yourself useful while i'm gone.
{16211}{16266}I'll be back by supper.
{16303}{16357}Ma'am.
{16358}{16444}Ma'am, you won't forget to ask|about a ship for me, will you?
{16446}{16559}I'll check the ships in port for a|work passage situation, mr. Costain.
{16561}{16610}Thank you, ma'am.
{16611}{16694}And if i had a good-Bye kiss,
{16695}{16793}I just might bring home|some rock candy too.
{16794}{16840}Bye, mom.|Have a good trip.
{16842}{16902}You behave yourself.|Come on, tuck.
{16904}{16954}Come on, come on.
{17219}{17269}Hey, son.
{17343}{17421}- What's the matter?|- She's probably gonna see that Bryson.
{17422}{17471}Who's that Bryson?
{17473}{17535}He's some old man who keeps|pestering her to marry him.
{17537}{17599}Oh.|I sure hope she don't.
{17601}{17686}- Why is that?|- Well, he wears perfume|for one thing.
{17688}{17761}He's always patting me on the|head and calling me "my boy."
{17762}{17877}That's what he always says.|"Well, my boy, you're|sprouting up like a weed."
{17879}{17934}He probably thinks|that's a compliment.
{17936}{18000}Well, it's not.
{18001}{18057}I'll say this for him though.|He's got good rock candy.
{18059}{18132}Oh, well, that's|a good quality to have.
{18133}{18183}A lot of men|don't have that.
{18185}{18265}Say, how 'bout you showing me|around the spread?
{18266}{18337}Well, sure. I'll show you|where i fished you out first.
{18338}{18409}Down by the cliffs|there's some caves and things.
{18474}{18525}All right, hold it up.|Can't see it all|in five minutes.
{18677}{18769}I do wish you would begin to take me|a little more seriously, henrietta.
{18771}{18827}I do, Cal.|You know i do.
{18864}{18921}You know what a disastrous|year last year was.
{18923}{18992}And crop prices don't|look any better this year.
{18994}{19048}- Then with the increased|burden of taxes--|- Oh, we'll muddle through.
{19049}{19123}- We always have, haven't we?|- Yes, but that's the point.
{19125}{19188}There's no reason for a woman|like you to have to struggle so...
{19190}{19236}Just to eke out|a meager existence.
{19238}{19284}Why don't you put|the place up for sale?
{19286}{19332}But i don't want to sell the farm.
{19334}{19385}You know how much it means to me.
{19387}{19456}Yes, i do.
{19458}{19545}My company is going to do|great things in the islands.
{19547}{19593}And as my wife,|you could--
{19595}{19642}I could have anything|my heart desires.
{19644}{19691}And i know you mean that, Cal.
{19692}{19752}But don't you see.|It just isn't possible.
{19754}{19809}Even if--
{19811}{19852}With the amount of money i owe you,
{19854}{19980}It is not proper for us to talk about|anything but a business relationship.
{19982}{20053}Money means nothing.|You know that.
{20055}{20136}- It means nothing at all.|- It does to me.
{20138}{20223}- Henrietta, i wish--|- Please.
{20306}{20348}That isn't going to change.
{20350}{20438}If ever i can do anything,|you just let me know.
{20440}{20497}Of course.
{20627}{20680}Good-Bye.
{21015}{21091}- And who are they?|- Those are the workers.
{21092}{21143}- The workers?|- Yep.
{21145}{21205}What do they do|when they're not working?
{21207}{21267}Well, there's lots of work.|We own 10,000 acres.
{21269}{21325}Biggest potato farm|on the islands.
{21327}{21388}Ten-Thousand acres of potatoes?
{21390}{21491}Most of it's open country.|Potatoes haven't been|doing too well.
{21690}{21755}Ten-Thousand acres, huh?
{21795}{21906}That's a good-Sized pea|patch, even where i come from.
{21907}{21975}- Where's that?|- Texas.
{21977}{22117}There you can ride for a month in|any direction and never touch a fence.
{22119}{22183}- Must be beautiful.|- Oh, it is.
{22184}{22262}Costain, do you think you|could ever like it here?
{22263}{22311}Me? No, no.
{22312}{22381}No, this fruit bowl|ain't for me.
{22383}{22440}Some people might like|it just fine, though.
{22442}{22496}I suppose you're going|back to texas, huh?
{22498}{22549}You bet.
{22605}{22692}- You got a wife there?|- Haven't met the woman|that could afford me.
{22694}{22764}- Then you never|did have one.|- Nope.
{22766}{22857}I had small pox once though.|Amounts to about the same thing.
{22859}{22906}Yeah.
{22908}{22970}I guess you'd never|want to settle down|and live with someone,
{22972}{23058}- No matter how nice she was, huh?|- You got that right.
{23108}{23157}But you can't have kids|if you ain't married.
{23158}{23221}Yeah, ain't that a mercy?
{23268}{23317}What are you going to|do when you get old?
{23318}{23374}Die, i guess.
{23375}{23461}No, i mean before that. Who'll take|care of you if you don't have a son?
{23462}{23525}I'll say one thing|for you.
{23526}{23578}You get a notion, you|sure hang on to it, burton.
{23579}{23629}Booton!
{23630}{23683}Oh, yeah.
{23685}{23747}- What's that?|- Come on!
{23932}{23983}What's going on?
{24403}{24465}- Untranslated subtitle -
{25022}{25079}Oh, no.|Those cattle again.
{25289}{25363}Go on! Get out!
{25921}{26001}Out of the way!|Hey!
{26003}{26070}Hey! Hey!
{26159}{26210}Costain!
{26235}{26303}Hey!
{26305}{26367}Out of the way!|Out of the way!
{26369}{26448}Costain, come on!
{26810}{26876}Hija! Hija!|Hija!
{27080}{27142}Hija! Hija! Move!
{27497}{27565}Costain! Costain!
{27698}{27792}Turn around, son!|Face him!
{27793}{27877}Don't move! Freeze!
{28596}{28659}All right, boy.|Run for the house.
{28853}{28905}Ya! Get out of here!
{29027}{29093}You should've seen|that critter, mama.|I was really scared.
{29095}{29168}And then he kept twisting that|bull's head 'til it fell over.
{29170}{29226}And then he let it go,|and it ran off.
{29227}{29298}That must've been|quite a sight.
{29299}{29395}So, you know how to tame them?
{29396}{29461}It's not a matter|of taming them, ma'am,
{29463}{29511}It's just a matter|of handling 'em.
{29512}{29611}You could sure handle 'em. Just like you|handled that bull. Pow! Right, Costain?
{29613}{29688}Booton!|Mr. Costain.
{29690}{29787}Mr. Costain, you could probably make those|old cattle do whatever you took a mind to.
{29788}{29867}I don't know about that.|It doesn't make much difference.
{29868}{29969}No point in talkin' about it.|You're in the potato business.
{29971}{30075}Were in the potato business.|Prices have dropped off|terribly.
{30111}{30190}Well, it seem to me|like you're...
{30191}{30272}Struggling|your way past a dollar,|just to grub after a dime.
{30274}{30377}You can get $20 a head for|them cattle in california.
{30458}{30530}But what you do|is your business.
{30531}{30603}Me? I'm on my way|to texas.
{30604}{30660}As a matter of fact, mrs. Macavoy,
{30662}{30738}Did you find anything in the way of|a ship for me when you were in town?
{30739}{30817}Oh, no. I think it's|the wrong time of year.
{30819}{30893}- But mama--|- For ships.
{30913}{30959}- I mean--|- Well, i'll just|have to make do.
{30961}{31010}I won't be imposin'|on you folks.
{31012}{31085}I'll head into town|tomorrow and wait.
{31086}{31162}As long as you're going to wait,|you might as well wait here.
{31163}{31218}Beg pardon, ma'am.
{31220}{31330}And work-- Help out.|I could pay you.
{31331}{31376}A little, not much.
{31378}{31453}Room and board too.|Right, mama?
{31454}{31566}- I don't know.|- Just for a while.
{31567}{31682}Until you earn so money. You'll|need some money, mr. Costain.
{31684}{31760}And, who knows?
{31762}{31852}With your help, we might|turn this sorry potato farm...
{31854}{31973}Into the first and only|wild cattle ranch in hawaii.
{32030}{32080}You, uh--
{32082}{32146}You sure you're not|from texas, ms. Macavoy?
{32147}{32194}You will stay,|won't you?
{32195}{32284}Won't you, Costain?
{32286}{32360}Well, i'll hit her a lick|and see what happens.
{32362}{32421}But that's all i'll promise.
{32581}{32655}- Aloha.|- Aloha, miss maka.
{32657}{32709}I want to talk to you this morning...
{32710}{32835}About some changes that are going|to be made on the farm today.
{32837}{32933}Mr. Costain is a|cattleman from texas.
{32971}{33052}And he knows how to handle the|animals as you all saw yesterday.
{33054}{33100}Yeah.
{33101}{33222}We have not been doing|well with our potatoes.
{33263}{33384}Mr. Costain feel we|would do better...
{33385}{33485}- If we caught the animals and sold them.|- Caught the animals?
{33486}{33550}Oh, no, wait!|Wait, wait!
{33552}{33652}You mustn't be frightened.|Mr. Costain assures me...
{33653}{33793}That the animals can be handled,|and he is going to teach us how.
{33794}{33866}Aren't you, mr. Costain?
{34172}{34226}All right, now.|This here animal is a horse.
{34228}{34342}Now you're all gonna have one of these|to chase them brush doggies out there.
{34373}{34421}Brush doggies.|That's cattle.
{34423}{34475}You need one of these|to keep up with cattle.
{34477}{34537}There's only two things you|gotta know about a horse:
{34539}{34616}How to get on and how to stay on.
{34617}{34712}This is your saddle, where|you're gonna sit when you ride.
{34713}{34786}You just sit in there like|a rocking chair, you savvy?
{34788}{34857}Just walk up here and put|your foot in the stirrup.
{34859}{34936}That's the stirrup. That's|right there. See it?
{34938}{35006}Put your foot in the stirrup|and swing right up. See?
{35016}{35077}To! Bravo majstore!|Svaka èast!
{35136}{35202}Good. Now who's going|to be the first to try it?
{35273}{35385}Well, there's one thing you can't|learn to do, is ride without getting on.
{35387}{35445}- Now come on!|- Go, go, go!
{35447}{35495}Come on.
{35496}{35568}All right, now.|You all watch him.
{35720}{35771}To! Bravo majstore!
{35801}{35857}Turn around.|Go on, turn around.
{36496}{36554}Now you try it.
{36972}{37051}Yes, it's true.|They do like their fun.
{37053}{37117}Like it? They'd rather|giggle than laugh.
{37119}{37205}They'd rather laugh than eat.|They're like a bunch|of kids out there.
{37207}{37261}A school girl'd be more sober, ma'am.
{37263}{37308}Well now, after they|get to know you better,
{37310}{37359}And understand what you're|trying to teach them--
{37360}{37423}Oh, and another thing.|You say you can't buy|any horses.
{37425}{37477}Now, how do you expect|me to work cattle...
{37479}{37549}With one|old wall-Eyed refugee|from a glue factory?
{37551}{37605}- Well, maybe--|- If you could get 'em,
{37607}{37669}You don't have any bridles,|saddles, blankets.
{37671}{37751}You don't have|any spurs, boots.
{37753}{37831}Ma'am, they don't even have|anything decent to wear.
{37832}{37935}Well, if we need horses...
{37975}{38026}Perhaps i can get some.
{38027}{38099}I-I don't know how.
{38144}{38178}Yes, i do.
{38179}{38269}I can get horses,|and i will.
{38271}{38340}And their clothes may not suit you,
{38342}{38398}But they find them very comfortable.
{38399}{38471}Yes, ma'am, comfortable.|I think that's the right|word for it.
{38472}{38562}Besides, anything they need,|they can make here.
{38563}{38678}There isn't|a single thing needed|that we can't make right here.
{38680}{38729}Except for a--
{38731}{38822}A little determination|and leadership...
{38823}{38886}From a man|who has the know-How.
{38887}{38968}And that is a fact, mr. Costain.
{39016}{39099}When are you going to stop|calling me mr. Costain, ma'am?
{39172}{39275}When you stop calling me|ma'am, mr. Costain.
{39614}{39680}It's just a formality, henrietta.
{39682}{39730}I don't think you should|even bother to sign it.
{39731}{39816}I will not take another loan from|you without giving proper security.
{39818}{39886}This is a mortgage for|all of your property.
{39887}{39942}It's disproportionate,|it's not necessary.
{39943}{40047}Cal, i owe you a great deal.|Now i need more money.
{40105}{40126}And this is the only|way i'll take it.
{40127}{40179}Business is business.
{40181}{40263}- Even between us?|- Especially between us.
{40294}{40350}All right.
{40352}{40426}- Thank you very much. And good night, Cal.|- Good night, henrietta.
{40871}{40923}Another favor|for the lady?
{40925}{40987}As a matter of fact,|yes.
{40989}{41095}Whenever she needs money,|she can always ask you.
{41097}{41145}And i give.
{41146}{41214}And now, the mortgage.
{41246}{41326}Maybe if she owe you more|than she can pay back--
{41362}{41486}You could say that mrs. Macavoy|and i finally are partners.
{41767}{41805}Hooey-Hooey!
{41947}{41987}All right, that's enough,|that's enough.
{41989}{42045}You can get off.
{42077}{42125}Ahhh!
{42334}{42398}All right now, who's next?
{42483}{42583}Malakoma, mr. Costain|is working under my orders.
{42629}{42702}- Do you hear me?|- What is it? What does he want?
{42704}{42772}- He doesn't like you at all.|- He's challenging you.
{42773}{42843}Yeah, he thinks he's|something special around here.
{42909}{43001}All right, partner,|you're something special.
{43031}{43123}Come on, leleo.
{43124}{43160}Come on.
{43162}{43246}Malakoma!
{43335}{43471}If he's looking to get a rise|out of me, he just did it.
{43527}{43608}No, you mustn't!|He'll kill you!
{45445}{45527}Well, you won that one,|all right. Here.
{45529}{45654}Here, let me show you how|we do it where i come from.
{45655}{45771}Now, you get off this|land and don't come back.
{46400}{46451}Come on, leleo, get up there.
{46591}{46669}Come on, leleo.
{46742}{46797}Come on, leleo,|get up there.
{47008}{47091}They're coming, they're coming!
{47093}{47151}Mom, come see! They're here!
{47153}{47217}Come on, they're here!
{48203}{48258}Move! Move, you!
{48260}{48309}Move, move!
{48338}{48385}Ah, thanks, boss.
{48386}{48464}First, the blanket, then the saddle.
{49182}{49229}Where are you going, batton?
{49230}{49287}Booton!
{49289}{49377}Ah, shucks. What's the use?|I can't get the dang thing|to work anyhow.
{49379}{49493}In my outfit, we only quit when|it's too dark to work or time to eat.
{49495}{49553}I didn't hear the|dinner bell, did you?
{49797}{49881}Now, you put the stirrup|up over the horn like this.
{49950}{50005}Ugh!
{50061}{50111}Now, go to work.
{50253}{50300}Put the reins together.|Hold them in one hand.
{50301}{50350}That's it. Get, go on.
{50352}{50440}Would you keep in a circle?|Keep in a circle!
{50441}{50499}Slow down, slow down!
{50501}{50584}Keep your feet in there.
{50586}{50684}Benton, not up and down. Sit|there like a rocking chair.
{50686}{50735}Booton!
{51111}{51176}You wrap it around|and you get it tight.
{51177}{51221}Got that?
{51268}{51329}All right, kimo. It's your turn.
{51331}{51381}Get him, kimo.
{51383}{51430}Yeah, go get him.
{51831}{51933}But they are learning,|actually learning. It's amazing.
{51935}{51996}You're making yourself the|laughing stock of the island.
{51997}{52118}One of the captains was saying they're|even talking about it in lahaina.
{52213}{52260}Good luck.
{52262}{52308}Ya.
{52505}{52575}Ready, boss!
{52576}{52611}Go to it.
{53293}{53375}- What do we do now, boss?|- We could try some card tricks.
{53376}{53458}We fine, boss.|We've not had enough yet.
{53503}{53556}Well, i have.
{53634}{53695}Mr. Costain?
{53803}{53857}Mr. Costain?
{53937}{54007}I'd like you to meet|a friend of mine.|Mr. Bryson, mr. Costain.
{54009}{54060}- Mr. Bryson.|- Mr. Costain.
{54062}{54123}So that's they way you plan|to catch wild cattle?
{54125}{54194}Not exactly, no.
{54195}{54241}Ms. Macavoy, tells me you're new|on the island. Where are you from?
{54243}{54306}- Texas.|- Texas? How did you happen|to come to kauai?
{54307}{54404}I was unhappy|with my last employer.
{54406}{54453}Who was that?
{54455}{54563}Mr. Bryson tells me it's impossible to|load cattle onto boats in these waters.
{54565}{54641}It was tried once|on the big island.
{54643}{54735}Two ships ran on the reefs,|and there is no anchorage|further out.
{54737}{54800}Well, don't they have docks in hilea?
{54802}{54860}Never needed them.
{54862}{54922}Well, how do|they load then?
{54923}{54998}Mostly by long boat.
{55000}{55094}Can you imagine trying to|load cattle by long boat?
{55096}{55194}Well, there's gotta be a way.|Just a matter of findin' it.
{55195}{55268}Mr. Costain says there ain't never|been a horse that ain't been rode,
{55270}{55374}- And ain't never been a rider that ain't been thrown.|- Is that what he says?
{55375}{55478}I won't challenge the statement,|but i will the grammar.
{55480}{55563}Grammar never was my strong suit.
{55565}{55638}Young man, you are sprouting up|like a weed.
{55694}{55733}At least he's got|good rock candy?
{55734}{55811}- I beg your pardon.|- Excuse me.
{56236}{56302}Good morning, boss.
{56350}{56401}Where are they?
{56434}{56490}Oh, boys no tell me, boss.
{56492}{56552}Maybe they go work|someplace else, yes?
{56554}{56683}Yeah, maybe it'll snow|this afternoon too.
{56685}{56742}But i doubt it.
{57949}{58039}Yah! Whee!|Whoo-Hooey!
{58136}{58191}Yee-Haw! Whoo!
{58364}{58420}Let's get out of here!
{58743}{58808}What do you think|you're doing down there?
{58809}{58869}Costain!
{58922}{58969}Whoo-Hoo!
{58971}{59054}Costain!|Look out, Costain!
{59056}{59119}Aaah! Aye!
{59399}{59468}Are you all right, Costain?
{59469}{59557}Fine!
{59559}{59610}Just fine.
{59729}{59821}You just can't expect to change|a whole culture overnight.
{59823}{59897}I don't have|a least notion of changing it.
{59899}{59996}If you just give me my wages,|i won't be troubling you|any further.
{59998}{60064}You know, this is sunday.
{60065}{60128}They're entitled to some recreation.
{60129}{60257}Well, there just ain't any sundays when|it's roundup 'til the job gets done.
{60259}{60335}Well, perhaps if you met them|half way, they would be able--
{60336}{60422}Ma'am, there aren't any "half|ways" in the cattle business
{60424}{60520}It'd be easier to make|a cherry pie out of barbed wire,
{60522}{60578}Than to make a cowboy out|of the best of the lot of 'em.
{60579}{60627}They just ain't cut out for workin'.
{60628}{60663}Booton says they're really trying.
{60665}{60723}That's what's frightening.|They are.
{60725}{60798}- Well, if they're|showing progress--|- They're not showing progress.
{60799}{60859}They're just trying.|It ain't the same thing.
{60861}{60970}Ma'am, suppose i could|whip them into shape.
{60971}{61043}It's not possible,|but just suppose i did.
{61044}{61118}Running cattle is--
{61119}{61187}Well, it's not just|riding and roping,
{61189}{61236}It takes, it takes purpose.
{61238}{61356}And you can't teach that to someone|like you can teach 'em to sit a horse.
{61451}{61545}I figure you owe me $17,|but whatever you think's right.
{61676}{61772}Mr. Costain,
{61774}{61855}I could raise|your salary.
{61887}{61934}It's not the money, ma'am.
{61935}{62008}I think i ought to get back to|texas before i lose all my stitching.
{62010}{62109}I have nightmares about these|people you wouldn't believe.
{62111}{62182}Well, this won't get|you back to texas.
{62183}{62251}Well,|it'll get me started.
{62339}{62399}Couldn't you at least|wait until morning?
{62400}{62460}I mean--
{62462}{62523}I don't know, ma'am.|I don't think so.
{62525}{62645}If i wait around 'til morning,|it'll just make things tougher|than they ought to be.
{62858}{62907}Mrs. Macavoy,
{62998}{63092}There ain't nothin'|personal in all this.
{63094}{63154}You people have been|mighty kind to me.
{63330}{63381}Bye, ma'am.
{63562}{63611}Costain!
{63661}{63718}Costain!
{63819}{63886}Mama, mama!
{63960}{64022}Mama.|Where is he, mama?
{64023}{64076}He's gone, son.
{64078}{64169}- Gone? You mean forever?|- I'm afraid so.
{64170}{64258}But how could you do it?|How could you just let him|go like that?
{64260}{64341}I just didn't let him go.|He's a man, he does|what he wants to.
{64342}{64404}- I couldn't stop him.|- Well, you could've tried.
{64406}{64452}You could've got me up.|I would've made him stay.
{64454}{64543}Booton, please.
{64765}{64835}I bet $20.
{64936}{65027}Twenty and raise twenty.
{65105}{65170}That puts me out. I don't|have anything to bet with.
{65202}{65270}Oh, i wouldn't say that.
{65547}{65643}Five-Card stud, gentlemen.
{66021}{66087}What's he doing here?
{66089}{66161}Taking money away from fools.
{66226}{66297}He's been winning|all night.
{66461}{66553}I see you've found an|easier way to make a living.
{66555}{66618}There's an empty chair|if you feel like sitting in.
{67281}{67331}Ace bets.
{67332}{67413}Don't talk unless|you're in the game.
{67593}{67624}Bet 20.
{68127}{68238}I hope you gentlemen will forgive|me, but i've got a ship to catch.
{68240}{68346}- You leaving the islands?|- Well, thanks to these|gentlemen gamblers.
{68348}{68457}Captain, if you ever dock in fort worth, you|look me up. Give you a chance to get even.
{69051}{69130}You stay.|We be cowboy for you, boss.
{69131}{69196}No swim, no fish,|not even sunday.
{69198}{69283}- We work hard, boss.|- No water slide.|Not any kind of play.
{69285}{69357}They mean it, Costain.|Really.
{69413}{69489}We got clothes good for catch cows.
{69491}{69559}- Our pants no good, boss?|- You stay, boss.
{69561}{69642}- Come on, Costain!|- Please, stay, boss.
{69643}{69746}- Who belongs to this boat?|- Me, mister.
{69747}{69842}Could you row me out|to that ship out there?
{69843}{69915}It's a long row.
{69985}{70065}- Come on, boss!|- Please stay, Costain!
{70067}{70136}- Stay!|- Come on, Costain!
{70195}{70274}Come on, Costain.|Don't go!
{70276}{70357}Come on, Costain.|We promise to work!
{70986}{71089}Costain, i didn't hear the|dinner bell ring, did you?
{71222}{71291}Turn around,|row for shore.
{71823}{71898}And he bought boots for all of them?
{71900}{71978}Yep, with his poker money. He said we just|had to have them if we're gonna run cattle.
{71979}{72025}Look there.
{72162}{72218}Mighty good, boss.
{73168}{73220}Ya-Hoo!
{74181}{74227}- We finished now, boss.|- Good, huh?
{74229}{74275}Yeah, boss.
{74276}{74356}Well, all we gotta do now|is fill it up.
{74544}{74622}That's a great deal|of money, Malakoma.
{74624}{74660}More than you can earn in a year.
{74661}{74760}You did not|get it from me.
{74762}{74847}You didn't come here.|Do you understand?
{74905}{74963}You and Malakoma no talk.
{75002}{75049}That's it.
{75051}{75125}I don't care how you do it,
{75127}{75217}But i don't want those|cattle rounded up for sale.
{75363}{75431}Costain, Costain!
{75644}{75679}Yeah, what is it lily?
{75682}{75741}- Untranslated subtitle -
{75744}{75800}- What?|- Animal in field, boss!
{75802}{75868}Oh, yeah?
{75869}{75925}All right, let's just|see what you've learned?
{75927}{75981}Let's go.
{76301}{76359}Kimo, cut your teeth.
{76436}{76525}Kimo, shake that loop out|and go to it.
{78063}{78146}Kimo, what's wrong?|What happened?
{79388}{79486}How does he know he's dying if he|doesn't even know what's wrong with him?
{79487}{79579}They call it|death by sorcery.
{79613}{79709}- Witch doctor.|- Malakoma is one of them.
{79710}{79789}I don't believe in it, but they|believe in it, and that's what matters.
{79790}{79844}That's why they won't work for you.
{79901}{79946}But why kimo?|It's me he's after.
{79947}{80036}I don't know. I suppose he feels|that's the way to get to you.
{80749}{80817}Liliha, what's the matter|with you, woman?
{80818}{80874}Liliha, Liliha!
{80876}{80945}Liliha, it's Costain.|Now stop it.
{80947}{81025}Malakoma get you, Costain, for sure.
{81026}{81073}You leave here or you die.
{81075}{81145}You just tell me|where he is.
{81147}{81280}Malakoma say two more days,|kimo die, then leleo.
{81281}{81317}I'm not leaving.
{81319}{81391}So if we're gonna|die, we're gonna die.
{81393}{81503}The only chance we have is if|you tell me where Malakoma is.
{81551}{81608}Now tell me, Liliha.
{81674}{81733}Him go taboo ground.
{81735}{81826}Live all alone in|caverns of dead gods.
{88378}{88451}Are you lucky|i need you alive!
{89551}{89646}All right now,|loud and clear, do it.
{89648}{89732}Do whatever it is you have to do, or|you and me are gonna bump heads again.
{89733}{89801}Now, do it!
{90211}{90272}What'd he say, Liliha?
{90274}{90350}He say kimo no die now.|No more anna na.
{90854}{90907}Kimo?
{90972}{91097}- The spell is over.|- You bet it's over, for good.
{91099}{91180}No, no, kimo.|You rest.
{91182}{91248}Yes, miss maka.
{91249}{91300}Booton, you watch him.
{91483}{91594}You better go find yourself|another island, buster. Get goin'.
{91992}{92064}Well, don't stand around.|Show's over.
{92066}{92175}Come on, come on.|We got a lot of work to do.
{92238}{92304}Mr. Costain.
{92306}{92379}They'll never forget you|for what you've done.
{92380}{92435}They'll do anything|for you now.
{92488}{92583}We'll see who forgets who|when the going gets rough,|ma'am.
{92716}{92779}Just remember what|you learned and use it.
{92780}{92835}You might come out of|this day in one piece.
{92836}{92883}Mount up.
{92961}{93007}Well, miss Macavoy,
{93008}{93095}You may or may not own a bunch|of maverick cattle at sundown,
{93096}{93151}But at least you won't|have to wonder anymore.
{93152}{93204}Today's the day|that tells it all.
{93206}{93267}I know, mr. Costain.|Thank you.
{94646}{94748}They're bunched up in the brush.|That ain't good.
{94750}{94834}Don't try to rope 'em in there.|Just haze 'em out in the open,
{94835}{94892}So you can throw|a good loop at 'em.
{94894}{94966}All right,|let's cut the brush.
{95127}{95209}Whoa! Not|the first time, boy.
{95210}{95287}You're ready.|You're not that ready.
{95289}{95378}No, you just hang back,|watch how it goes this time.
{95380}{95456}Next time out,|it'll be you and me.

{100145}{100195}Yes, ma'am.
{100389}{100479}Hija!|This is just a dry run|to see if it works,
{100480}{100545}But i want to take 'em|right out to blue water.
{100734}{100809}- You all set, Benton?|- Booton!
{100811}{100885}All right,|let's give it a try.
{100887}{100941}- Okay.|- All right, boss.

{101727}{101789}Now, ho.
{101791}{101874}Don't let 'em|shift to that side.|They're movin' around.
{101875}{101966}Don't let 'em shift over there.|They're all movin' over there.
{101967}{102035}Keep 'em over. Keep 'em|over to the other side.
{102111}{102212}Don't let-- Don't--|Ugh! Get that brindle|back on the other side.
{102471}{102537}Pick 'em up!|Pick 'em up!
{102669}{102732}Hija! Hija!
{103671}{103770}You're not so ornery|when you can't get your feet|planted, are ya?
{103926}{104005}You'll tow like|a washtub with horns,
{104007}{104064}But i think you just gave me|the answer, bossy.
{104264}{104324}Yee-Haw!
{104332}{104394}Yee-Haw!
{104396}{104473}What makes you think|you can get them critters|out to the ship?
{104475}{104531}What makes you|think i can't?
{104533}{104598}Well, no one|ever has, lad.
{104600}{104681}That's beside the point. Do you|want the cattle or don't you?
{104683}{104769}Indeed i do, little lady.|As bad as you want to sell 'em.
{104771}{104879}I'll give you 15 dollars|a head, loaded on.
{104881}{104975}Sir, you're a captain,|not a pirate.
{104977}{105059}Twenty dollars a head.|Not a penny less.
{105061}{105107}Alongside.
{105196}{105281}Seventeen-Fifty, on board.|There's no profit in it for me.
{105317}{105368}Uh, a gentleman...
{105369}{105461}Is not supposed to lie|in the presence of a lady.
{105463}{105515}Twenty dollars.
{105517}{105565}Alongside.
{105750}{105852}Upon my word, lad, i wish you|had left the little lady at home.
{105974}{106030}All right, 20 it is, on--
{106032}{106079}- Alongside.|- Alongside.
{106081}{106132}- Thank you very much.|- You're not leaving so soon.
{106134}{106232}We'd love to stay, but we've got|more cattle to sell, haven't we?
{106234}{106294}Yes, indeed we have.|Good day.
{106456}{106555}It's impossible to load|cattle aboard those boats!
{106556}{106663}I would not bet|against that man.|No, not on anything.
{106784}{106856}And he can't deliver|cattle he can't find.
{106858}{106906}Can he?
{106956}{107016}- What?|- Stampede them.
{107056}{107103}Will you do it?
{107104}{107220}Sure, with some guns and a|little help, they'll go, but--
{107941}{108032}It doesn't really hurt 'em.|I mean, they're a tough breed.
{108034}{108154}It's not always true. It just|depends on where you are at the time.
{108343}{108436}You only do that with--|Yearlings...
{108438}{108527}When you know you got|a long winter comin' on.
{108528}{108599}'Course your winter here|only lasts about 20 minutes.
{108601}{108652}What's wrong, Costain?
{108830}{108919}Stampede. Stampede!|Get everybody out of these huts.
{108920}{108979}Everybody out!|Everybody out!
{109263}{109347}Liliha! Stampede. Get all the|women and children to the beach.
{109348}{109404}You men saddle your horses.|Now move! Move!
{109406}{109491}Stampede! Stampede!
{109670}{109715}Go get your mother!
{110009}{110082}Hija! Hija!
{110643}{110715}Liliha, i told you to take|them to the beach. Now go!
{110978}{111042}What can we do?
{111114}{111155}Get under there!
{111929}{111981}You take care of your mother.
{112086}{112136}Hija!
{112696}{112813}Run those leaders!|Run them!
{113049}{113124}Come back!|Stay with me!
{113278}{113365}Oka, kimo, turn 'em!|Turn 'em!
{114147}{114195}Aaah!
{114500}{114547}Marrujo!
{114592}{114668}For two bits, i'd take you|apart and feed you to the hogs,
{114669}{114723}But i need you for somethin' else.
{114724}{114772}Come on.
{115688}{115783}Where the devil|have you been?
{115784}{115847}What happened out there?
{115848}{115925}The stampede, Bryson.
{116079}{116160}It was quite a ruckus.|Should've been out there|yourself.
{116162}{116208}What are you doing here?
{116210}{116268}Gettin' ready|to have you put away.
{116270}{116366}But first there's a matter of|mrs. Macavoy's note. I want it.
{116367}{116474}Note? You can't-- That's a legal|document. She owes that money to me.
{116475}{116554}After tonight,|with the cattle she lost,
{116555}{116626}The grounds and the|buildings getting torn up,
{116627}{116713}I figure you and the lady|are about even, mister.
{116715}{116768}I want the note.
{116770}{116819}Now.
{116821}{116919}All right.|I'll get it for you.
{117994}{118042}What's goin' on?
{118144}{118196}He's all yours.
{118253}{118330}- All right on your feet.|- Come on now, let's go.
{119199}{119250}Hey, watch out now!
{119846}{119911}- Captain.|- Oh, it's good|to see you, ma'am.
{119913}{119965}And especially your merchandise.
{120053}{120137}All right, oka,|throw a loop on one...
{120138}{120199}- And move him out.|- Right away, boss.
{120965}{121030}Hey! Oh-Ho!
{121032}{121089}All right, let him go.
{122979}{123079}Keep pullin'. Steady. Tighten|down now, tighten down.
{123724}{123792}All right, take him out.
{124483}{124561}Well, barrin' tidal waves|and barbary pirates,
{124563}{124648}You're about to be|in the cattle business|all the way.
{124823}{124912}Come to think of it,|i think we could handle|a tidal wave.
{125183}{125251}- Stand by!|- Stand by!
{125343}{125391}Away the sling!
{125866}{125946}- Take him up.|- Hoist him away!
{126316}{126392}- Lower away!|- Lower away!
{126476}{126525}Easy does it, matey.
{126708}{126763}- Steady!|- Steady as she goes.
{127650}{127733}Hey, you know, i think|i sold them boys short...
{127734}{127810}When i said they couldn't|drive hot nails in a snow bank.
{127812}{127881}I think they could.|I really think they could.
{127883}{128001}- Henrietta,|what are you cryin' about?
{128003}{128113}I don't know. I guess i never|really believed it would happen.
{128114}{128200}You made a believer out|of me, Costain, missus.
{128201}{128265}Here's your money.|Coin of the realm.
{128266}{128378}A mate's pay to anyone who will|nursemaid them cows back to california.
{128447}{128528}Well, that's my chance|to get back to texas.
{128565}{128633}I don't know, captain,|that right temptin',
{128634}{128729}But i don't think i could leave mrs.|Macavoy with them pineapple cowboys.
{128730}{128827}They'd drive her dingy, and i'm the only|one around who knows how to handle 'em.
{128829}{128901}Well, suit yourself, lad,|and i don't blame you.
{128902}{128962}But i gotta get them|cows to california.
{128964}{129015}Thanks to both of you.
{129017}{129064}- Good-Bye.|- Good-Bye, now.
{129117}{129213}Then you are going to stay?|At least for a while, linc?
{129241}{129305}Well, for a while, yeah.|For a while.
{129306}{129376}You know, 'til they|get the hang of it.
{129377}{129449}Then i'm gonna get off|this flower pot.
{129450}{129515}Mama! Mama!
{129517}{129578}- Good heavens,|we're right here.|- Tarnation, mom!
{129580}{129669}I swam one of those critters|out just as smooth as butter.
{129671}{129720}- Did you see?|- Of course we did, dear.
{129721}{129779}And nobody could have done it better.
{129781}{129859}Oh, well, now,|that's a little thick,|don't you think?
{129860}{129951}Ain't nobody gonna pin a rose|on you just for doin' your job.
{129952}{129998}You remember that, Booton.
{130000}{130070}Mom, mom, he called me|by my right name!
{130072}{130148}Did you hear him?|He said it right|for the first time!
{130439}{130531}Can we do it together|this time? Can we?
{130532}{130618}Well, can't think|of any reason why not.
{130620}{130672}Throw your loop.
Ohh. Ohh-ho-ho!
Does that hurt. Ohh-ho-ho.
Ohh!
It is unbelievable how much pain a thing like this can cause.
It, uh... Have you ever had a corn?
No, I have never had a corn.
Regent Dietz, I know that it's hot today and people are a bit out of sorts, but there is no reason to be mad at me just because I have a corn on my foot.
I am not mad at you because you have a corn on your foot.
I am mad because
I have something important to say.
And I haven't been able to get it out because of your foot.
I'm either hearing about it, or you're limping around on it.
Will you please sit down?
(MURMURS) Sit down. Yes. Ohh.
Oh, you're right. That's better. Yes.
Well...
I have a message from the Board of Regents.
Good. The Board of Regents.
How is the board these days?
- Disappointed.
- Disappointed?
Disappointed.
- Disapp... Uh, about what?
- Plenty.
They feel that your problems here at the school are overwhelming.
Well, so do I.
And the board wants action.
New blood. Fresh ideas.
Top level changes, Higgins.
That's what the board wants and, frankly, I agree.
Oh, uh, good thinking, Dietz.
Yes! Fresh faces. New blood.
Top level changes. That's the ticket.
Good! Good to hear that you agree.
- When are you leaving?
- Oh, just as soon as I can...
What? When am I...
Well, you didn't mean...
Top level changes.
Yes, Higgins. Top level.
Well, not the very tippy-tippy-top.
Well, surely not the very tippy-tippy-tippy top.
Yes, I'm afraid the very tippy-tippy, tippy top.
Let's face it, Higgins.
You've had years to get this place back on its financial feet and you haven't done it.
Waste. Waste, waste.
Here. Look at this budget.
Well, the costs for the science department alone, they're ridiculous.
Oh, the science...
That's that Quigley again. Oh, I know.
I'll fire him. That'll end the waste.
Oh, I guarantee that.
Quigley out, waste out. You'll see. Ohh...
I'm afraid firing Quigley is not going to satisfy the Board of Regents.
Now, Higgins, let's not make a problem out of this.
Why don't you just step down gracefully?
Step down? Well, I can't step down.
I'm right in the middle of my, uh, uh, my promotional program.
- Promotional program?
- Yes!
To raise money.
That's what you want, isn't it? Money?
Yes, money. But how...
How? Don't you worry about...
Uh, uh, all I need is 30 days.
Higgins, honestly, I don't...
Thirty days, Regent Dietz.
All right, 30 days. But that's it.
No more excuses this time.
(SIGHS) I don't know what I'm going to tell the Board of Regents.
Regent Dietz, you'll find your confidence in me is amply rewarded.
- What confidence?
- "What con..." Ohh. (CHUCKLES)
In 30 days, the changes you'll find around...
Higgins, I've already told you, you have your 30 days.
But do something.
Let's get some order restored around this place above all, and no more expensive nonsense.
Uh, regent Dietz, there is no nonsense going on around here, I can assure you.
If there were, I would see it.
Nothing escapes my eye.
Higgins, what are you doing?
How... What... What am I doing?
- Uh, you forgot something.
- Forgot something?
Yes, you forgot your, uh... Oh, your hat.
Oh, yes.
Wait a minute. This is not my hat.
As a matter of fact,
I wasn't even wearing a hat.
Oh, that's right.
That's my hat.
I thought I recognized that.
Oh, and tell the Board of Regents to cheer up.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Doesn't it?
Type something.
A little higher on your side.
That's it.
Leave it right where it is. Perfect.
Hey, Dexter, what do you think of that?
That's terrific, Schuyler.
Yeah, it does look pretty good, doesn't it?
You know, I'm not sure a cow twice as starved as Ruthybelle would have anything to do with this stuff.
Well, it's probably that acid taste she doesn't like.
You get rid of that and she'll probably like it.
Yeah. Maybe you're right.
Carry on.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dean Higgins.
- All right, where is he?
- Hey, dean, what happened to your foot?
- Never mind my foot. Where is he?
- Who?
- Who? Quigley who. That's who.
- Isn't he here?
Uh, he'll be a few minutes late.
He just dropped by the supply room to pick up a few more test tubes.
You mean that he leaves you people alone?
Well, sure. Why not?
Yeah. We're on the honor system.
I suppose that is on the honor system too.
A cow, on the honor system?
Hey, that's pretty good, Dean Higgins.
Stop trying to butter me up.
I know that isn't funny.
Dean, is there anything we can do for you?
No, there isn't anything you can do for me.
I just came up here to make a little announcement.
Back to work.
A little announcement? Hey, maybe he's going to give Quigley promotion.
Yeah, wouldn't that be something.
If it isn't asking too much, do you think I would be going beyond my prerogatives as dean of this college to ask you what you're doing?
Oh, no, sir.
Well, what are you doing?
Well, I'm crushing vitamins.
I can see that. Any fool can see that.
- What for?
- Oh, for the cow, sir.
Everything we do around here is for the cow.
You mean to tell me that you're crushing up perfectly good vitamins to feed to a cow?
Well, yes, sir. That's how we're gonna cure Ruthybelle's nutritional problem.
- Who?
- Ruthybelle. The cow.
As you can see, she's sort of skinny.
Hopefully we'll end up with a fat cow.
So that's what all this expense is for.
To make a cow fat.
Oh, not only fat, sir, but a strong cow too.
- Thrilling, isn't it?
- I'm overwhelmed.
I knew you would be.
- You see, it was really my idea.
- I thought so.
The kids are just helping me out.
Uh, if you'll excuse me.
Shorty, I need another piece of pizza.
The flavor's not quite right yet.
One piece of pizza coming up.
- Pizza?
- Yeah, and she seems to like it too.
Do you think maybe she's Italian?
- That's not funny, Schuyler.
- Don't you get it?
An Italian cow eating pizza.
An Italian cow!
That kills me!
Engaging in a bit of merriment,
Dean Higgins?
He is. I'm not.
Oh, I see.
Well, it's nice of you to come by.
- May I show you around?
- No, you may not show me around.
I've already been shown enough with this vitamin-grinding numbskull that calls himself a science major.
- I heard that, sir.
- Good!
That's not all I have to say, Quigley.
Do you have any idea how much this operation is costing you?
Well, not really, sir, but we're cutting back everywhere we can.
- You take the cow rental, for instance.
- HIGGINS: Cow rental?
Do you mean we're paying money to make a cow fat?
You don't want us to have skinny cows, do you, sir?
Skinny cows, fat cows. Who cares?
- Dean Higgins, please don't get excited.
- I'm not excited!
Just tell me how much rental we're paying for this so-called cow.
Well, not very much, sir.
- How much?
- Would $15 a day be too much?
Fifteen dollars a day?
That's the extravagance.
If the Board of Regents ever finds out about this...
Quigley, you're...
Yes, sir? I'm what?
You're... (GASPING)
What's the matter, sir? I'm what?
You're... (GASPING)
Boy, he sure is having trouble getting out that announcement.
You're fired.
- Fired?
- Fired?
Yes. Fired.
- Well, what about his promotion?
- Promotion?
Quigley, just as soon as you can get out, I want you out of here!
Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!
And another thing! You kids better stop thinking about fat cows and think about some way to make some money for this school, because if you don't in 30 days I'm out, and if I'm out, you're all out!
You're all out.
I'll see to that! Out! Out!
DEXTER: What's the matter with him?
He acts like he's gone crazy.
QUIGLEY: I think I can explain it.
The school has got some large financial problems.
In fact, it may be going under.
The Board of Regents has been giving
Dean Higgins a lot of pressure.
GIRL: But what's he going to do without you?
The school will get along fine without me, but thank you. I'll tell you what.
Why don't you all go back and clear away your things and...
I guess we'll call it a day.
(SIGHS) Yeah. Hello.
MAN: Uh, hello. This Dexter Riley?
(SIGHS) Uh, yeah, this is Dexter Riley.
Well, this is Silas Willoughby, the man who rented Ruthybelle to you.
Yeah, how are you, Ruthybelle?
How you doing?
This isn't Ruthybelle.
Ruthybelle's a cow.
Oh.
Now, what I wanna know is what you fellas did to her.
Yeah, well, somebody did something to her.
She's already given us
80 gallons of milk and still goin' strong.
What do you think of that?
Come on, Brutus.
(SIGHS) Go home, Blossom.
- That big dog pickin' on Brutus again?
- Yeah.
Schuyler, you're just gonna have to teach that dog not to be chicken.
Yeah, Brutus, you're cute, but one of these days you're gonna have to stand up and fight.
- Can I have some of your cereal?
- Sure. Help yourself.
Thanks.
Boy, that's sure gonna be tough.
Tough? What do you mean?
- Quigley having to leave the school.
- Oh, yeah.
This place isn't gonna be the same without him.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about it.
I mean, after all, how many times has Higgins fired Quigley?
I mean, I can remember him being fired at least five times.
I've only been here six and a half years.
I think.
Or is it seven?
Uh, Schuyler,
I don't think I want any more of your cereal.
Well, that's okay.
- Comin', Dexter?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
Come on, Schuyler.
You're gonna Miss psychology.
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna miss it at all.
I'm gonna fix my car.
Hey, your cereal.
You sure you're through with it?
(SIGHS) Yeah, I'm through with it.
Give it to Brutus. He'll eat anything.
Oh, yeah. Hey, Brutus!
Come on, Brutus!
Breakfast! Brutus!
- Go to that test.
- Yeah, I know.
Late again.
What'd you do with my blue socks yesterday?
That's great!
- I think I got a rock in my shoe.
- I'll hold your books.
- Dexter, how'd you do that?
- Dexter!
Uh...
- I'll take it!
- My man!
I'm gonna take it!
Go, buddy! There you go!
Slam-dunk it! Slam-dunk it, Dexter!
Wow!
Hey, Dexter, you're goin' the wrong way.
Oh, no, I'm not! Come on!
Really, Elmer,
I hate to have to keep haranguing you, but all of this eating in class, it simply has to stop.
I can't help it, Dean Higgins.
I get hungry every once in a while.
"Every once in a while"?
Do you realize I have reports from your first, third, fourth and your seventh classes?
They are all complaining about your eating.
Really!
All of this bag-rattling and cracker-crunching while people are trying to study.
Yes, Mercedes. What is it?
Professor Quigley's here to pick up his severance check.
Professor Quigley, hmm?
Well, you inform Professor Quigley that we don't give out severance checks anymore.
But we always give out severance checks.
Well, we don't anymore.
We just ran out of money.
Money, money, money, money.
That's all some people think about. Money.
What do you want? Uh, where was I?
You were talking about my bag-rattling and cracker-crunching.
Oh. yes. And that is not the half of it.
I've got complaints here from our janitorial service.
They're reporting large cake crumbs in rooms 306 and 308.
Now, this is very serious business, Elmer.
Teachers I can get, students I can get, but janitors... Ohh.
So, consider this a final warning, Elmer.
I don't care what you do out of class, but in class no more jelly beans, no more cake, no more cookies, no more...
Elmer?
Elmer, am I getting through to you?
Hey, Dean Higgins, guess what.
"Guess what"? Guess nothing.
How dare you burst into my office when I'm reprimanding a student?
Oh, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to interrupt, but something happened to Dexter.
"Something happened to Dexter."
Something is always happening to him.
That's nothing new.
Besides, that's no excuse to come...
Quigley, what are you doing here?
I'm afraid I don't know, sir.
Listen, Dexter got strong.
I mean, really strong.
Professor Quigley, your ideas on that formula really worked.
Are you talking about the formula you used on the cow?
Yeah.
All right, you kids.
All right. Out, out, out, out!
- (ALL CHATTERING)
- Hey, Dean Higgins.
Look!
Good heavens.
And that's just with his right hand.
Show him what you can do with your left.
You see what I mean?
Hey, let me down, will you?
Yes, for heaven's sakes, let him down before he breaks something.
- All right!
- (ALL CHEERING)
There you go!
- How did all this happen with the...
- I don't know.
I just ate some of Schuyler's cereal, and all of a sudden I got strong.
Let me see that cereal.
This is the same cereal
I eat every morning. I never get strong.
Well, of course not.
It's not the cereal that made him strong.
It was, well,
Professor Quigley's and my formula.
Just plain cereal wouldn't do anything like that, no matter what those companies say.
I know.
- What's the matter, Dean?
- Hmm?
Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing.
Would you young people mind waiting outside for a moment? You too, Elmer.
There you go. Everybody out.
I want to talk to Professor Quigley alone for a moment.
You mean he's still working here?
- Well, of course he's still working here.
- (ALL CHEERING)
You kids get the craziest ideas.
Would you do something about that?
Everybody out. Here we go.
Bye-bye. (CHUCKLES)
Aren't they wonderful?
Quigley, do you realize what we have here?
Well, it seems as though we might have quite an amazing scientific development.
It is more than that, Quigley.
Do you realize what these cereal companies would give to have a strength formula like this in their cereal?
- No. Never really thought about it.
- Well, you think about it.
You think about it!
Why, we've got something here that will get this school out of hock forever.
Much-needed new buildings, a new lab, money for all kinds of scientific experiments.
And besides...
Besides, if something doesn't happen around here pretty soon, you'll be out of a job.
That's right... That's not the point!
Uh, um... Mercedes, would you get me the, uh, president of the Crumply Crunch cereal company,
Coyote Corners,
Kern County, Connecticut.
That's Crumply Crunch?
Crumply Crunch!
See, under normal conditions
I can hardly move that at all.
Why don't you try to...
Oh, he can't do it.
- (GRUNTS)
- (BACK CRACKS)
Oh! I... I see what you mean.
Gentlemen, I think that it's time that we get started.
- What do you think, Harry?
- Obviously a charlatan. A dime a dozen.
A strength demonstration?
Can you imagine the boss falling for a thing like this? Over the hill.
Should step down, let a younger person run things around here.
Now, gentlemen, as all of you know, the chairman of the board hasn't arrived yet.
However, I would like to welcome Dean Higgins and ask him to be patient with us for a few minutes.
That's quite all right.
My time is your time, gentlemen.
Yes. Unfortunately, our time is not yours.
Now, it is approximately two minutes past 1:00.
I humbly suggest that you demonstrate whatever this is you're going to demonstrate so that we can get on with the real business of the meeting.
MAN: But we can't start without the chairman.
As senior vice president and second-in-command, we can start whenever I say.
Any objections, gentlemen?
Trying to start without me again, Harry?
Who, me? Of course not! (LAUGHING)
I could never do a thing like that,
Aunt Harriet... I mean, Aunt Crumply...
Uh, Mrs. Crumply.
Aunt Harriet will be fine.
But remember, just because you're a relative doesn't mean I can't fire you.
Any of you.
At ease, gentlemen.
Now, will the secretary please tell us what's the first thing on the agenda?
Yes, Aunt Harriet.
That's, uh, Dean Higgins.
He's the one who claims to have that strength formula.
Oh, yes, I believe I spoke on the telephone to you.
You're that funny little man from that funny little school downstate.
Um, yes, I guess I am.
And you're here to demonstrate your strength formula for us?
If I recollect correctly, and I always do.
- (ALL MURMURING)
- Oh, yes.
And, madam, that is precisely why I am here.
Really, Dean Higgins.
Hmm? Oh! Oh, this...
This is my old gym outfit.
We weren't so fussy in those days.
How... (CHUCKLES) How cute.
- Very cute.
- Oh. Thank you.
- Uh, may I proceed?
- Certainly.
My. Doesn't that cereal have a lovely crackle?
BOARD MEMBERS: Yes!
Oh. Excuse me. That was a little throwback I didn't expect.
Now, with your permission, I'd like to start with some weight lifting.
Going to show you how easy weight lifting can be.
- Bravo!
- ALL: Bravo!
Ohh.
- Ohh!
- (ALL CHEERING)
MAN: Bravo! Bravo!
(CHUCKLING) Oh!
He's gonna balance it on his chin!
- Bravo!
- (CHEERING CONTINUES)
Oh, no! Ohh!
MAN: If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I would have never believed it!
He is truly remarkable.
Ohh!
HARRIET: Oh, my, that was exciting.
And that's not all, gentlemen.
ALL: Oh, more! More! More!
More!
Oh, marvelous.
Hyah!
(MOUTHS) More?
Oh, no, Dean Higgins! No! No!
Please, Dean Higgins, uh, that's...
That's quite enough, thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got a little carried away.
I didn't realize how potent that formula was.
I hope I didn't upset anything.
Oh, no, you didn't upset a... A thing.
(CHUCKLES) Did he, gentlemen?
Oh, no, aunt Harriet! Not him! Not at all!
Be seated.
Now, tell me, Dean Higgins, how long does the strength stay with you?
To tell you the truth, we don't exactly know.
That depends on the person and the amount of the formula used, but the duration of the strength is definitely limited.
- Oh, that's bad.
- Oh, but, Aunt Harriet, all the better.
If a person were to lose his strength, he'd have to eat more cereal to regain it.
Just think what that would do.
Why, we could sell cereal morning, noon and night.
Now, that's good.
Brilliant, Cousin Edward. Brilliant.
Now, gentlemen, I want you to pay strict attention.
The time has come to talk turkey.
To say nothing of cereal. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHING) "To say nothing."
Sit down, Roscoe.
Sorry, Aunt Harriet.
Gentlemen, after years of playing second fiddle to the Krinkle Krunch cereal company, we are now going to be number one.
We're number one! We're number one!
ALL: We're number one!
We're number one! We're number...
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
Dean Higgins, do you have a weight lifting team at Medfield?
Well, uh, no.
We don't exactly have the personnel to go in for that sort of...
Good. Stanley, put the phone together...
And then get me Kirwood Krinkle of the Krinkle Krunch cereal company.
Krinkle? Aunt Harriet, what are you doing, talking to Krinkle?
Just you wait and see.
A weight lifting contest between State and Medfield?
But we were national champions last year. I mean, State, that is.
You know, I went there.
Oh, I believe everyone knows that, Kirwood.
But really, Harriet, what is the point of all this?
I am proposing, in the interest of sports and the cereal business, of course, that a much-publicized match be held between State and Medfield in which your company will support State and my company will support Medfield.
That way, the public can determine which is the number-one weight lifting team in America, and perhaps the number-one cereal company.
But, Harriet, we are the number-one cereal company already.
- Remember?
- Oh, I know that.
And I understand if you don't want to put your number-one position in jeopardy.
Nonsense. Krinkle Krunch is always ready for competition.
Besides, what a great publicity idea.
You know, Harriet, sometimes
I think you're a wonder. Just a wonder.
Good-bye, Harriet.
Medfield vs. State. What a laugh.
We'll murder 'em. Right, men?
ALL: Right!
Uh, right.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Yes, Uncle Frederick?
Don't you think we should remind
Dean Higgins of one little problem?
Problem? What, uh, problem?
Spies!
"Spies"?
He means industrial spies,
Dean Higgins.
There is no length to which the Krinkle
Krunch company would not go to learn our plans.
Oh. Well, I can assure you that this project will be top secret.
I'll see that the lab is placed under maximum security.
You won't have to worry about any spies.
That's fine. Of course we do have a few spies of our own.
But the ones from Krinkle Krunch are everywhere.
It's just that we don't know who they are.
- This is me.
- This is me.
Good. Were you followed?
I don't think so.
- What is it, Harry?
- You're in trouble, Krinkle.
- Trouble?
- Yes.
That weight lifting match. Withdraw.
Withdraw? You're kidding.
State has the greatest weight lifting team in the country.
We'll wipe Medfield right off the map.
- She's sandbagging you, Krinkle.
- Sandbagging me?
Yes. That Medfield bunch have come up with a strength formula they're putting in Aunt Harriet's cereal that will literally knock your number-one out.
I'm telling you, withdraw.
I can't withdraw.
I just had a press conference.
I announced the whole thing.
In fact, I even bragged a little.
Then you're going to be number two, Krinkle.
I saw a demonstration of how that formula works and, believe me,
Medfield is going to murder State.
Medfield's not gonna murder State, and Krinkle Krunch'll never be number two.
Now, look, Harry,
I'm counting on you to get that formula.
It's worth $100,000 to me.
- It's worth a lot more than that.
- All right, 150.
150 is okay for me, but this is a big job. I'll need help.
All right, another 50 for the help, but for heaven's sakes, get some good people.
Don't you worry about a thing, Mr. Krinkle.
I think I have the right party in mind.
Exactly the right party.
Well, good-bye, Pete.
Always a pleasure to visit you, just so it's not for too long.
Well, Mr. Arno, you come any time, and just consider...
Our house is your house.
That's very good. (CHUCKLES)
Thanks a lot. Come on.
What does he mean, their house is our house?
It ain't my house. I never wanna go back to that joint again.
He's just puttin' you on, stupid.
Besides, we won't have to go back there again if you don't louse up anymore.
Why do you always blame me every time we get into predicaments like this?
Because it's your stupidity that gets us into these predicaments, that's why.
ARNO: Hey! It's Harry!
That's nice. A reception committee.
Hey! Harry, you old son of a gun.
- How's life treating you?
- Couldn't be better.
Chauffeured limousine, penthouse downtown, first cabin all the way.
As I said, things couldn't be better. How about you?
Well, as you can see
I've had a temporary setback, but don't let that worry you.
I'll be right back on top before you know it.
I know you will.
As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here.
Oh? What's up?
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Is he okay?
Who, him? Oh, sure.
A little stupid, but he's okay.
You gonna start that kinda talk again?
You keep that up, you're gonna cause me to lose my confidence.
Oh, yeah? (LAUGHING)
Hey, what's the caper, Harry?
I'll tell you all about it on the way to town. Get in.
But, boss, I don't care what that guy Harry says.
Every time we get mixed up with them
Medfield kids, we end up in jail, and I don't wanna go to jail no more.
I don't go for that "Our house is your house" stuff anymore.
Cookie, nobody's goin' to jail.
It's a real simple job that we're getting paid a lot of money for.
All we have to do is find out where the formula is and go in and get it.
- You say that's simple?
- Why, sure.
As a matter of fact, it's so simple
I'm gonna let you handle it yourself.
Yeah? All by myself?
All by yourself.
It's a chance to prove yourself.
You'll figure it out, you'll do the leading, I'll do the following.
You really mean that, boss?
I do the leadin', you do the followin'?
That's what I said.
Yeah, I like that.
I lead, he follows.
Terrific.
All right, now here's the plan.
When that truck leaves we go around the back of the building, up on the roof, over onto the scaffolding and down in front of the lab window.
The formula's in there.
I don't like this scaffold business.
But, boss,
I cased this joint this afternoon.
The halls are loaded with security guards.
It's the window or nothin'.
We gotta use the scaffold.
- All right, but I still don't like it.
- Here. Wear these.
- What for?
- For the ropes of the scaffold.
- What, are you stupid?
- Who's stupid?
I don't like takin' orders from you.
But, boss, don't you remember you said to me,
"Hey, you lead and I'll follow"? Quote.
Yeah, and that's the stupidest thing
I ever did in my life.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- (ENGINE STARTS)
Okay, follow me.
Come on, come on.
Hey, it's windier up here than it is down there.
Yeah, because it's higher up here than it is down there.
I know that!
- Come on, boss. Come on.
- All right. I'm comin', I'm comin'.
Come on, come on.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Put my foot on the rail, will you?
Put your foot on this, like this.
Okay, easy now.
- ARNO: I'm comin'. Wait a minute.
- Okay.
- Right down. Just jump.
- Wait a minute.
Perfect. Perfect. Just perfect.
ARNO: Ohh! Oh! I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die! Ohh!
- I'm gonna die.
- Boss, let go of the wall, will you?
I can't let go.
Boss, let go of the wall.
You're all froze up.
Let go of my arm!
- Aaaah!
- Ohh!
COOKIE: You know, you're violent.
And you're an idiot.
What are you tryin' to do, kill me?
All you had to do was let go of the wall. The whole thing was lopsided.
I'll say, this whole thing's lopsided.
I'm gettin' up there again.
You don't wanna get off now.
The worst part's over.
The rest is a cinch, I'm tellin' ya.
All we gotta do is work these ropes here, we go down nice and easy to the window.
- Yeah?
- Come on, get the rope.
This I gotta see.
Uh, you're sure you know how to work those ropes, right?
Sure I'm sure.
I worked on 'em today all by myself with a phony window washing job.
Now with you helping me, it should be a snap here.
All we gotta do is release it together, a notch at a time, and we go down nice and slow.
- Yeah.
- Ready?
- Okay.
- Okay, boss, lower away.
- Ooh.
- There. You see, boss?
Yeah. Yeah, this works pretty good.
Oooh. Ohh.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
This does work pretty good.
Sure it does.
I told you I had it all worked out.
You know, boss, you got all choked up and froze over nothin'.
That ain't good for your heart.
And another thing. You gotta trust other people to figure things out sometimes.
Oh, yeah?
Trust other people? Like who?
Well, people like me, for instance.
- Cookie! Get me up!
- Give me your arm, boss!
- Give me your arm!
- ARNO: Get me up, you idiot!
I can't get up! Ohh! Oh, my arm!
- Wait a second.
- (GROANING)
Whew! I don't blame you for bein' scared, boss.
- For a minute I thought you was a goner.
- Aah, you idiot!
It wasn't me, boss.
It was the rope. It got a knot in it.
You got a knot in your head!
Just stay there, boss. No problem.
I'm not stayin' anywhere.
All I gotta do is release the rope, that's all.
Oh, boy. Hang on, boss! I got it.
Ohh! Cookie! Cookie!
What are you doing, you crazy nut?
- Wait a minute.
- (GROANING)
Ohh. Take it easy, will ya?
- Take it ea...
- Uh-huh. I got ya.
Oh, you got me. You got me. Ohh!
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Jeez!
Oh, that smarts. Ohh.
You did that on purpose!
Boss, here we are, right at the window, just like I said!
- Look. We just gotta go in here. Yeah.
- Oh. Oh.
Goin' back, we take the stairs.
You can't. The halls are loaded with those security guys.
I'll take my chances with those security guards.
I'm not goin' back on that scaffold with you.
But I know how to work the ropes now.
I don't wanna hear any more about those ropes.
Now, let's get that formula and be quick about it.
All right, no problem.
It should be right over here.
Yeah. The kid was workin' at this desk today.
Let's see here.
I thought he put it in one of these drawers here.
- That's funny.
- Funny? What's funny about it?
You drag me here in the middle of the night, almost get me killed on that stupid scaffold, and all you can say is, "That's funny"?
But, boss, it's gotta be here someplace.
I could swear the kid put it in one of these drawers, I'm tellin' ya.
Wait a second.
I was washin' that window there.
I look through,
I see the kid workin' around here.
It's funny.
Will you quit sayin' funny and find that formula!
I'll find it, boss. I'll find it.
You'd better. It's worth 50,000 bucks.
- Now, start lookin'.
- (SNORING)
- Shh!
- What?
- (SNORING CONTINUES)
- What was that?
What?
Sounds like somebody snoring.
Don't be ridiculous.
Hey, maybe they got this joint bugged.
You know how those security guys are.
They're probably picking up everything we say right now.
That's it. We'd better get outta here in a hurry, but quietly.
But boss, wait a second.
You can't go out there.
The place is loaded with security guards.
Cookie, I'm takin' over now.
We do it my way. I'm not followin' you anymore. You're followin' me.
Understand?
Ah, whatever you say, boss.
That's more like it. Come on.
- (EXCLAIMS)
- (GASPS)
- I told you.
- Oh, shut up. Over here.
- Cookie! Do something, stupid!
- Yeah.
Wait a second, boss. I got it.
- Hurry up! Hurry up, will ya!
- I'm hurryin'!
- I'll handle the rope this time.
- But, boss...
Oh, shut up!
The window.
HARRY: Well, you two really botched things up.
I suppose you read this paper?
Well, of course we read it.
Everyone in town read it.
Including Mr. Krinkle, and he's furious.
Well, it looks like we gotta go back there.
What do you mean, "Go back?"
We can't do that.
Those security guards'll be around there like crazy.
I don't care what you do, but get that formula!
How are we gonna do that unless we go...
Now, wait a minute.
There's only one way I know of to get that formula.
That's out of the head of the kid who owns it.
But boss, I know that kid.
He couldn't remember all that stuff if he had the formula right in front of his face.
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
Let's pick him up.
I know a certain Chinese gentleman who can be a great help in a case like this.
Brutus?
Here, boy!
Brutus?
Brutus?
Hey, kid, you lookin' for a dog?
I sure am.
- (LAUGHING)
- Mr. Arno.
Well, gee, thanks a lot.
Where did you find him?
Oh, he was wandering around a few blocks down, so we picked him up.
His address was on his collar. We were just taking him there when we saw you.
You looked like you were looking for a dog, so we stopped.
That sure was nice of you.
You know, I don't care what anybody says about you, Mr. Arno.
Anyone who's that thoughtful about dogs is a friend of mine.
Think nothing about it, kid.
- Thanks again.
- That's okay. Good night.
Good night.
- Aaah! Aaah!
- (BRUTUS BARKING)
All right, get in.
Get outta here, ya mutt.
Come on, ya mutt! Get outta here!
Huh. Schuyler was so worried about Brutus being lost.
Really. You would've known he'd be home before Schuyler would.
Officer Hurley, this is Dean Higgins.
I want to report a kidnapping.
A kidnapping.
It's, uh, Richard Schuyler, that boy genius from Medfield college.
How do you know he's kidnapped?
How do I know he's kidnapped?
Because he's been out looking for his dog for three hours. That's how I know.
Well, Dean Higgins, a boy looking for his dog for three hours is not unusual.
Well, it is when you consider that the dog has been back for two hours and 45 minutes.
I'm sorry, Dean Higgins, but the department can't get all ruffled over this.
I do have a suggestion to make, though.
What's that?
Well, if the dog was lost and was able to find his way home in 15 minutes, why don't you send the dog out to find the boy
and don't bother the department about it? How's that?
I don't like it, and I don't like your attitude.
Let me speak to the chief.
I'm sorry, the chief is not available.
He is out addressing a Chinese dinner.
A Chinese dinner?
You mean, with all of these vicious kidnappings going on,
the chief of police of this city is at a Chinese restaurant stuffing his face with rice and noodles?
Yes!
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sure I don't need to tell you gentlemen that I didn't come down here to Chinatown just to stuff my face full of rice and noodles.
(LAUGHS) Rice and nood...
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, I...
In any event, they're very tasty.
My compliments to the chef.
No, I have more important things to do than that.
I'm down here, gentlemen, to talk to you on behalf of our police department.
SCHUYLER: Honest.
You gotta believe me.
I don't know where the formula is, and I don't know what's in the formula.
COOKIE: Boss, I hate to do this, but I gotta get rough with this kid.
Five minutes, I find out. It always works.
Honorable sir.
I admire your enthusiasm, but this boy can never tell you what is in the formula, because he thinks he doesn't know.
How do you know?
I know.
You see, stupid? He knows.
Now, will you shut up?
In order to find truth,
I must put boy in deep sleep.
Then he will tell us all he knows.
Aw, boss, this guy's gotta be kiddin'. Come on.
Be patient.
You will see, my son.
"My son"?
Where does he get off calling me his son?
- Maybe he likes you.
- Well, I don't like him.
He gives me one of those complexions, like maybe I'm not as smart as he is, or something.
He does, eh? I wonder why.
Now what's he gonna do?
With your permission, what you Americans call brainwash.
Brainwash?
Boss, I don't go for this hocus-pocus stuff.
Neither do I.
Why don't we just go back to the old-fashion method, belt the kid around and get the information?
Will you be quiet?
I'm paying Fong to do this.
Now will put boy in hypnotic trance.
Cause deep sleep.
Make patient feel very happy.
Very happy's okay, but what's with that needle there?
Must use acupuncture.
Fashionable today among modern Chinese.
Mallet, please.
This won't hurt, my son.
FONG: See? Patient happy.
You are very tired, my son.
Your eyes are heavy.
You will sleep, you will be happy.
And you will go into a deep, deep sleep.
When I snap my fingers, you will open your eyes, and answer my questions, though you will still be asleep.
Hey, would you look at that.
FONG: Remember, we are your friends.
You shall tell us everything you know.
Everything. Right from the beginning.
Right from the beginning.
Oh, yes.
Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.
What?
Not quite that far back.
Tell us about the formula.
Do you remember what you put into your strength formula?
Oh, yes, I do remember what I put in my strength formula.
Proceed, please.
Unit consistency,
600 decagrams, thymine.
700 centigrams, calcium pentethemate.
900 milligrams, niacin.
Not so fast!
450 centigrams, pyridoxine.
500 milligrams, pyridexamine.
What did he say? What did he say?
That must be all.
There's got to be more than that.
We shall see. Another needle, please.
For the life of me I cannot understand what has happened to that boy.
Frankly, Dean Higgins,
I find it all very mystifying.
- (PHONE RINGING)
- That could be him now.
I hope so.
Dean Higgins here.
Harriet Crumply here.
Oh, ha... Aunt Harriet.
Uh, how are you?
Absolutely miserable.
What seems to be bothering you, aunt Harriet?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just woman's intuition,
but I have the strangest feeling.
- I can't pin it down.
- (COUGHS)
Dean Higgins, is everything going along all right?
Everything is wonderful here.
It's fine. I mean, uh, wouldn't I have called you if it weren't?
Oh, good.
I'm glad to have your reassurances.
You know, everything I have is tied up in this.
If we were to lose,
I don't know what I'd do.
No. Uh, well, frankly, my future wouldn't look too bright either.
HARRIET: Well, good.
I'm glad there's nothing to worry about then.
Good night, Dean Higgins.
Good night, Aunt Harriet.
FONG: Is there anything else, my son?
And one piece of pizza.
Must admit, very unusual ingredients for medical formula.
However, ways of western people I not quite understand.
Sounds crazy to me too.
Well, what else can you expect from this dopey kid?
He's come up with a formula that's just screwy enough to work.
Come on. Let's get this over to Harry.
That Krinkle cereal guy is waitin' for it.
Now, wait a second, boss.
We gotta take care of the kid here.
He can identify us.
Young man will be unable to identify anyone.
He will remember only what I tell him to remember, will do only what I tell him to do.
Good. I trust you, Fong.
See that he gets home as soon as possible, and make sure he doesn't remember anything.
Just give Cookie and me a minute to get out of here.
My son, you will awake when I clap my hands.
When you do, you will remember nothing.
You will not remember where you have been, nor what has happened to you.
All you will know is that your little dog is home, and he is looking for you.
He needs you.
You must hurry to him. He is lonesome.
You must get home as fast as you can.
Take the first means of transportation you see.
Thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.
I'll be very happy to come down again any time at all, but...
(LAUGHS) Right now
I'm afraid it's getting a little late.
I've got to be along back to my office.
There are many pressing duties awaiting for me there.
So, just at the moment
I'll say good night all, or...
Ah! Better than that, er, uh, "saranola."
- (CHUCKLING)
- Is that Chinese?
What? No. Forget it.
How about just one more picture, chief?
With the official committee, and your men, of course.
Why not? All right, men.
Over here. Chop-chop.
Picture time. Eccles. Winwood.
All right, Melzer. Oh! Hoppins, Hoppins.
I think I left my gloves inside, on the table of the restaurant.
Would you be kind enough to get them for me, huh?
There we are. Ah, now, huh?
Any friend of the friendly sons of St. Pat... Confucius.
Uh, right? Here we go, gentlemen.
- Hmm? There we are, now.
- Excuse me.
I have to go home to my dog.
He's waiting for me.
Sonny, will you get out of here?
Can't you...
His dog. His dog is waiting for him.
- Huh? You know, man's best friend?
- (ALL LAUGHING)
Very loyal. Fine, son.
You go right ahead.
Go right along. A fine, upstanding boy.
All right, here we go now. All set?
Okay. Everybody say, "chow mein."
ALL: Chow mein.
FONG'S VOICE:
You must get home as fast as you can.
Take the first means of transportation you see.
- (TIRES SQUEALING)
- (SIREN BLARING)
That crazy kid took my car! Mount up.
After him. Everybody!
Mount up and get that crazy kid!
Get on the radio.
Emergency. Call headquarters.
I want an APB sent out on that kid.
All right, Winwood, burn rubber to headquarters.
Huh? Oh, hold it just a second.
Fine example of young America.
Confucius say, "joy gin."
Oh! Ah! Ah! Wait!
Chief, your gloves!
Forget the gloves, you idiot!
Shoot me down!
Chief?
It's been almost five hours.
I know Schuyler real well.
He's just not the type of guy that would go wandering off for that length of time without at least phoning somebody.
Officer, you're not listening to me.
Maybe you'll listen to me.
What?
Well, of course this is Dean Higgins.
Wants to know if it...
Who else would it be?
But Dean Higgins, a boy out looking for his...
You should have sent someone out here by now.
Well, I know he's on his way, but so is Christmas.
Wait a minute.
I think I hear someone now.
Could he have picked up a friend on the way?
Sounds like he's picked up a couple of...
Listen, I better get some satisfaction.
I've waited long enough.
Ridiculous. I hate to tear down the police department, boys, but we have a young fella kidnapped.
They could at least send one person out here.
But it's the same old story. There is never a cop around when you need one.
Brutus?
Brutus?
Brutus.
- Brutus?
- On the ground!
Hi, Brutus.
I'm sorry about the bail money.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry doesn't feed the bulldog.
And you're paying me that money back. One hundred dollars!
Can you imagine, Quigley, paying $100 for some shenanigans like...
What I don't understand, Schuyler, is what you were doing in a Chinese restaurant.
I don't understand either.
I don't remember anything.
Didn't happen to talk to anyone, did you?
I don't think so.
- He doesn't think so.
- QUIGLEY: Well, think hard.
You didn't happen to talk to anyone about anything important, did you?
- Important?
- He means about the formula.
Oh, of course not.
Don't worry about the formula.
I got that all locked away up here.
ALL: Up with Krinkle!
Down with Crumply!
Up with Krinkle! Down with Crumply!
Up with Krinkle! Down with Crumply!
All right, all right.
Cereal history is about to be made.
Gentlemen, it works. I feel the blood rushing through my veins.
It makes me feel so young, so strong, so, so, uh...
- Vibrant?
- You got it, Becker. That's it.
Vibrant!
Ah! Feel that!
Feel it! Feel it!
Don't hold back! Feel it!
- Feel it!
- (MEN CHATTERING)
Enough! You'll wrinkle the suit.
And now, what to do?
Sir, with your strength, if I were you,
I'd do just whatever I wanted.
Aha! Good thinking, Mertons.
I know exactly what I want to do, what I've wanted to do for years.
Great-grandfather Krinkle,
I'm so sick of you sitting there, looking down at me, watching everything I do.
Not that! Not our founder!
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right.
Excuse me, great-grandfather.
I lost my head.
So you think you're number one, huh?
- Do you?
- ALL: Yes!
- Do we deserve to be number one?
- ALL: Yes!
We've gotta prove it.
You think we can prove it, men?
- You can do it!
- I know, men, I know. I'll...
The weights.
No, no, no. They're too easy.
The lights! Ah, that would be silly.
Ah! I have it.
We all know that Dean Wiggins split that cheap tabletop of Harriet Crumply's with a karate chop.
Can I do less with this?
ALL: Perfect!
Gentlemen, stand back and watch out for splinters.
Ha! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh, that... Ooh!
- Forty-eight five, forty-nine...
- Forty-eight five, forty-nine...
- ...forty-nine five...
- ...forty-nine five...
- Fifty G's.
- Fifty G's!
- Cookie, we're on top again!
- (PHONE RINGS)
Good news. That must be him now.
Hello. (WHISPERING) It's him.
Hello, Mr. Krinkle. How are you?
What do you mean, it didn't work?
Well, it didn't work!
And I can prove it!
- I can't believe that.
- Well, believe this.
If Medfield wins that weight lifting contest, we're all gonna be through.
Can you imagine those skinny punks defeating a great team like State?
- Why, it's ridiculous!
- Yes, it is ridiculous.
Wait a minute. It really is ridiculous.
Look, Mr. Krinkle, if the formula doesn't work, it's all the better.
If it doesn't work for us, it doesn't work for them.
It just means that Harriet Crumply will be destroyed.
She'll have a bunch of weaklings eating her cereal on TV with the formula in it. (LAUGHS)
Now, what if the sure winner, the greatest weight lifting team in America was seen eating Krinkle Crunch cereal just before the match?
What would that do for us on national TV? Huh?
He likes it.
Yes, I can handle it.
Oh, and Mr. Krinkle? Try and be there.
You'll love every minute of it.
Love every minute of it.
No, no, no. I'll take care of this until after the match.
But why?
I just heard you tell him he had it made.
I mean, what could happen?
Probably nothing, but you better have some boys lined up, just in case.
Medfield had the right formula once before.
Let's make sure they don't get it again.
I'm tellin' ya, it's gonna be a cinch.
You guys saw me when I lifted that real heavy guy in Dean Higgins's office.
- He was like a feather.
- Yeah!
And remember the look on Dean Higgins's face?
- Yeah.
- And the basketball backboard?
I really can't take any credit for it.
Schuyler, it's your cereal. It's terrific!
The second you guys eat the stuff, you're gonna feel like giants!
Yeah, I can hardly wait to get that stuff in my stomach!
We'll murder those guys!
Come on! Let's go!
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
ALL: Good afternoon.
I'm warning you, Higgins.
You've been dragging us out to these foolish events for the last 30 years, and you never had a winner.
This is your last chance.
I'm sick of it! Sick of...
We're all sick of it, Higgins.
Well, uh, gentlemen, Regent Appleby,
I think I can assure you, you won't be sick this afternoon.
I'm tellin' you for the last time, you better have a winner!
MAN: You can say that again, Appleby.
I'm tellin' you for the last time, Higgins, you better have a winner! (COUGHING)
Well, ladies and gentlemen of TV land, it looks like we're about to begin this much-publicized match of the century.
ANNOUNCER: And now, sponsored by Aunt Harriet Crumply
and her new vitamin-enriched cereal super formula "X, "
we present the Medfield Wildcats!
And sponsored by Horatio Krinkle,
and nurtured by the world-famous Krinkle Krunch,
we proudly present the national champion State team!
You know, on the surface this does look like a terrible mismatch.
Doesn't it, Harry?
Yes, but we know better, don't we, Quigley?
Good luck.
I'm not sure whether we're having a weight lifting match or a cereal-eating contest.
We'll murder those guys!
Let's go get 'em!
- Hey, you comin', Dexter?
- Uh...
Uh, yeah. I'll be right with you.
Is something wrong?
Huh? Uh, no. Nothin' at all.
Good! I feel great!
ANNOUNCER: There will be a two-minute warm-up
before the competition begins.
Breathe!
Get up there! Good! Come on! Let's go!
- What's the matter, Dexter?
- Plenty.
Professor, we got trouble.
- The formula doesn't work.
- Doesn't work?
Dexter, how can you say it doesn't work?
Look at them.
Yeah, look at 'em.
They're just carried away.
They're just psyched up, I'm tellin' you, but they're not any stronger.
Schuyler, you didn't change anything, did ya?
- No, I'm sure I didn't.
- It's just not the same.
It isn't? Well, gee, I can't understand what could've gone wrong.
It's missing something.
No smoke, no nothin'.
Dexter, what do you think is wrong?
I just don't know. It's...
Wait a minute.
The acid taste.
It had an acid taste before.
But a vitamin formula like mine wouldn't have an acid taste. That's impossible.
You're right. A vitamin formula wouldn't, but mine would.
It had a definite acid taste.
That day half of my formula was missing.
What day was that?
The day all that stuff got knocked over in the lab.
The day the cow gave all the milk.
That was the day before I ate the cereal and got strong.
Schuyler, somehow my formula got mixed up in the cereal.
It was my formula that gave it the strength, not the vitamins.
You mean my formula didn't have anything to do with it?
I don't know, Schuyler. All I do know is that we don't have the right formula now, and if we want to win,
I'd better get the right one in a hurry.
Good. I'm glad you're doing something about it. By all means, get going.
ANNOUNCER: Will all contestants clear the floor, please.
- Give me the keys to your car.
- I ran out of gas just as we got here.
- How about yours, Professor?
- No. I came over with Dean Higgins.
ANNOUNCER:
The first contestant for state...
Dean Higgins?
...attempting 250 pounds,
Ambrose Joykowski.
Arno, this is Harry. You got the guys?
Okay. Here's what you do.
Dexter Riley is one of our contestants.
- Say hello to the nice gentlemen, Dexter.
- Hi.
Dean, I need the...
Could I have the keys to your car?
One of our better students too.
The keys to the car? Certainly.
- (KEYS JINGLING)
- Thanks, Dean.
Oh, that Dexter Riley.
Been around here a long time.
He's a senior now, but I remember when he first came to apply.
He came to me personally. He said,
"Dean, can I have the keys to your car?"
Well, naturally, I said no, because the...
The keys to my car!
He's got the keys to my car!
If that lunatic so much as scratches one bit of paint on that car, I'll...
Uh, nice boy, that Dexter.
Nice boy. See him? Nice.
Won't be the same when he graduates.
ANNOUNCER: For Medfield, attempting 275 pounds,
will be Peter "Porky" Peterson.
Two hundred seventy-five pounds.
He'll rip that off easy.
Yeah. We'll be ahead already.
What is that thing?
He's not liftin' weights for us.
(COUGHS) Uh, is he?
As you in TV land will notice, the Medfield contestant is a little bit out of shape, but don't let that fool you.
Remember, the cardinal rule of any sport.
It's not the muscle you have, but how you use it.
Higgins, what's he doing now?
This is embarrassing.
Atta boy, Porky, take it easy.
It's okay, Porky.
Everything's gonna be all right.
(SOBBING) Gone. Everything's gone.
I'm sorry, Aunt Harriet.
I just don't know what happened.
ANNOUNCER: For State, attempting 275 pounds...
Oh, leave me alone!
...will be Sam Nicoletti.
- Professor Quigley?
- Uh, yeah, Hector?
Well, you know, since the cereal thing didn't work, we were just wondering if maybe you might be interested in, uh, an honorable surrender.
Sit down, Hector.
Now, look, you guys, let's get one thing straight.
This meet is not over yet.
- It isn't?
- I've never seen anything more over.
ANNOUNCER: So then Yablonski of State pressed 350 pounds.
Then it was Medfield's turn again.
Hey, kid, we appreciate you keepin' the speed down, but don't you think this is being a little bit ridiculous?
Uh, I'm sorry, but I can't go any faster.
The next contestant for Medfield is Slither Roth, who will lift...
That is try to lift 100 pounds.
It looks like they've changed their strategy.
They're going down in weight instead of up.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have a Medfield contestant who doesn't look overly strong, but he does look like he has a lot of confidence.
I admire that. Don't you? (CHUCKLING)
- (WHISTLE BLOWS)
- He did it!
His muscles seem to have frozen.
He can't let go of the barbell.
Let go of it!
Ooh! Ohhh!
- That's the acid taste.
- (DOOR OPENS)
AJ Arno. What are you...
Okay, Dexter, we'll take that formula.
Uh, why?
It doesn't even work.
(GRUNTS) See?
Oh, that's all right.
We'll take it anyway.
Go get it, boys.
- Ah!
- It's you.
You leave me alone, young man.
You were behind this all the time, weren't ya?
I'm warning you, young man.
Now, you let me go.
DEXTER: Hey, fellas!
Here's your captain!
Strike!
Yaah!
- (WHISTLE BLOWS)
- (CROWD CHEERING)
Yaaaah!
And now for Medfield's last contestant and last hope,
Dexter Riley. (LAUGHS)
In order for Medfield to win,
Dexter will have to lift over 1100 pounds.
What do you mean, he's out for equipment repair?
He's gonna need more than equipment repair to lift that thing.
ANNOUNCER: The referee is allowing
Dexter Riley exactly four minutes.
Four minutes?
How can I get there in four minutes?
I don't know what's happened with you kids, but you sure change your drivin' habits fast.
Let me have your operator's license.
Uh, I'm afraid I left it in my clothes back at the gym.
That just makes it worse, kid.
Hope you got license plates on this thing.
- Well...
- Charley, wipe that off, will you?
ANNOUNCER: Now I see we're down to our final two minutes.
Now, if Dexter Riley doesn't appear and perform by that time,
it will be all over.
Two minutes?
I'm sorry. I gotta go!
- Where is that kid?
- Don't yell at me!
I told you, he's out for, uh, uh, equipment repair.
Why don't you call this whole farce off?
That kid's not out for equipment repairs, and you know it.
- Let's face it. He's run out on you.
- How dare you!
If Dean Wiggins says the boy is out for equipment repairs, the boy is out for equipment repairs.
Right, Wiggins?
- Higgins, not wiggins! Higgins!
- Higgins!
- My car.
- DEXTER: Don't worry about it, Dean.
It's just a question of replacing a few parts.
The only thing left is Annabelle.
ANNOUNCER: Dexter Riley, attempting 1111 pounds.
(GRUNTS) Oh, no. It's going!
I gotta get some more cereal, ref.
Hurry up, kid.
You haven't got much time!
- I'm all set now, ref.
- What was that?
That's Dexter Riley. He's a member of our weight lifting team.
It's working, Dexter.
Come on! Ooh! Come on!
He did it! He did it!
Medfield's won the meet!
Dexter Riley is the strongest man in the world!
TEAM: We are number one!
Hey! We are number one! Hey!
We are number one! Hey!
We are number one! Hey!
We are number one! Hey!
We are number one! Hey!
We are number one! Hey!
We are number one! Hey!

     [machine whirring]         
            [girl] nice landing,
            Uncle Bene.         
                 Right on the   
                 50-yard line.  
[boy] should've gone for a touchdown.                
 Next time, I'll put it         
 right between the goalposts.   
[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.               
 [Bene] that's why we arranged  
 this little vacation.          
 We've been so busy establishing
 our community on Witch Mountain
    That you two haven't had    
    an opportunity              
 To see what life               
 in the big city is all about.  
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.          
    [chuckling] there'll be     
    another time for that.      
 Just remember what I told you, 
 and have a lot of fun.         
         - It's locked.         
         - Tia?                 
     Tony, come back here.      
Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary.      
Tia?                            
If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too.
     [tires screeching]         
     [brakes squealing]         
    You the party               
    I'm supposed to pick up?    
 - [Bene] just the children.    
 - All right.                   
    Meter's running, hop in.    
         I got it.              
        [cabbie grunts]         
     I've been                  
     waiting here forever.      
You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people.      
                 We're exactly  
                 on time.       
Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up.         
I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months.
            We have seats       
            on the 50-yard line.
         [Tony laughs]          
            Deliver the children
            to this address.    
             You'll be paid     
             after you arrive.  
This is a big fare here.        
If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip.      
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday.            
 - Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene.     
 - Goodbye.                     
     - Have fun, you two.       
     - [tires screeches]        
[engine revving]                
                 [horn honking] 
     - Look at that dummy.      
     - [honking horn]           
             Get off the road,  
             you dummy.         
                         [sighs]
        These civilians         
        don't know how to drive.
         They ought to be       
         kept off the streets.  
 The streets belong             
 to us professional drivers.    
     Taxis, buses, trucks.      
 That's all that should         
 be allowed on the streets.     
 You see, I happen to know      
 a great deal about driving.    
I have a perfect safety record. 
                 [honking horn] 
            Come on, get out    
            of the way, you bum.
                         [sighs]
        [car doors shut]        
     [woman] thank you.         
     Thank you, sickle.         
Well, this is a perfect test site.            
Little traffic...               
...And low real estate value.              
                 It's adequate, 
                 I suppose.     
Ok, let's get this over with.   
This thing on all right?        
                     It's ready.
     What do you want him       
     to do this time?           
     I want you to              
     climb that fire escape...  
    ...To the absolute top.     
         Wait a minute.         
             Uh-uh.             
    This is as high as I go.    
     You want me to             
     break somebody's leg?      
 Just tell me how many pieces.  
 But up there, I don't go.      
- Why not?                      
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.               
I will fall.                    
     That is true, Victor.      
     He has acrophobia...       
     ...Among other things.     
 Find a different test for him. 
    Acrophobia is not           
    a problem with my device.   
        Start climbing.         
I will do anything else you say,
But I am not going up that building, understand?   
         - I...                 
         - Sickle...            
 ...I command you               
 to climb up that fire escape.  
                You will go     
                to the very top,
         You will turn around,  
         and you will look down.
     And you will not           
     be frightened of heights.  
                     Off you go.
                 It's working.  
                 It's working!  
It seems to be.                 
Victor. Victor, you are risking his life.       
He's my nephew.                 
My only living relative.        
He's the only one               
I can leave my...               
...Uh, my bankruptcy to.        
     That's what experimentation
     is all about, Letha.       
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.             
     I am the only one          
     we cannot afford to lose.  
 Can't you see that I've got    
 complete control over his mind?
             He has no fear,    
             no memory, no will.
        He can only             
        carry out my commands.  
 - [car rattling]               
 - what... What's happening?    
We're out of gas.               
What are you, crazy? Look at the dial, it points to... Empty.
             Empty?             
     - [exhales]                
     - [horns honking]          
         It was all that waiting
         I had to do for youse. 
 I'll run down the street to the
 gas station and get some gas.  
Boy, oh, boy.                   
         You guys are costing me
         a lot of dough.        
         I sure hope you        
         make the tip worth it. 
Something's going to happen to someone near here.           
             We've got to help. 
No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver.   
I'll go.                        
I think it came from back that way.                  
                     Be careful.
             And remember what  
             Uncle Bene said.   
That is enough.                 
Bring him down!                 
     [victor] sickle,           
     turn to your right.        
        Balance yourself        
                 And walk along 
                 the ledge.     
             [Letha] Victor, no.
             Stop.              
I'll bring him down myself.     
Give that to me.                
     [wires crackling]          
                    Look what   
                    you've done.
     [exhales sharply]          
         Sickle, stop.          
    Sickle, I'm                 
    commanding you to stop.     
 Sickle, this is Dr. Victor     
 Gannon commanding you to stop! 
     - He's out of control.     
     - [Letha] sickle!          
Go back!                        
 [Letha screeching] sickle!     
             No!                
                 Letha... Look. 
        - I can't look.         
        - You must.             
         [footsteps approaching]
        [Letha] it's miraculous.
There are no miracles, Letha.             
Only scientific explanations for everything.                 
Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing.              
        It... Must be...        
        ...That... Boy.         
    There's a...                
    There's a force that...     
 ...Centers around that boy.    
     A force capable            
     of countermanding          
 The basic physical law of...   
 Gravity.                       
 Victor, I don't know           
 what you're talking about.     
    Molecular mobilization.     
 - I need that boy, Letha.      
 - [horns honking]              
 - I need him desperately.      
 - Now, just a minute.          
             Brilliant, my boy. 
             Brilliant.         
Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic...              
Well, whatever it was you just did,                   
It was absolutely heroic.       
        It was nothing,         
        I just... [gasps]       
     [tires screeching]         
            [sirens approaching]
[dog barks]                     
[helicopter approaching]        
[boy #1] get off the street!                     
        - [boy #2] run!         
        - [boy #3] hide!        
        [boy #4] here come      
        the goon goons!         
         [older boy #1]         
         let's get 'em!         
    [older boy #2]              
    they run like chickens.     
[boy #1] more goons!            
         [boy #2] we're trapped!
[boy #3] hide or they'll get ya.
         Over here.             
[older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans. 
[older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang.        
             Let's finish 'em.  
     [older boy #1] hey!        
[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?
        It was a set up.        
    - Let's give it to 'em.     
    - Yeah.                     
         - [all yell]           
         - hey!                 
         [laughing]             
     That was an ambush!        
     [older boy #2]             
     stop banging into me.      
 [older boy #1] I can't see.    
[older boy #3]                  
I can't get out.                
 [older boy #4] get me out.     
 Get it off me.                 
    [boys] yeah! All right!     
Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out.         
             Yeah, thanks a lot.

     - And I'm dazzler.         
 We're the earthquake gang.     
            Does that scare you?
             - No.              
             - Aww.             
Let's change our name again.                 
We gotta have a name that scares.             
            - Yeah.             
            - Hey.              
 How'd you do what you done?    
     Well, I really             
     didn't do anything.        
     Yeah. You a magician       
     or something?              
             No.                
 You want to join our gang?     
    I'm sorry.                  
    I'm looking for someone.    
        - Thanks anyway.        
        - Aw, sure.             
     I guess you're like        
     the rest of them.          
     You've heard               
     we're a nothing gang.      
    Yeah, well we ain't         
    always gonna be nothing.    
     Someday we're gonna        
     be the toughest.           
 Take over the whole territory. 
    Someday they're gonna run   
    when they see us            
    coming down the block.      
         All right.             
    It's just that              
    I've got to find my brother.
 What gang does he belong to?   
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]                
 I never heard of a Guy         
 that never belonged to a gang. 
 I'm sure something's happened. 
 I've got to find him.          
    If anybody could find him,  
    we could.                   
     I mean, we know            
     this town inside out.      
         Oh, would you?         
        Hey, yeah, sure.        
Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you.        
     Thank you.                 
     Thank you very much.       
    Hey, come on, let's go.     
            That Tony sure      
            made himself scarce.
 - We better walk you home.     
 - Where do you live?           
I... I was supposed to stay at a hotel.                
But I don't know which one.                      
        You could stay          
        in our hideout.         
         - [boys] yeah!         
         - Thank you.           
     We'll look                 
     for Tony tomorrow.         
     If we aren't busy          
     beating up goons.          
     - Yeah.                    
     - Hey, it's yo-yo.         
        - Get down.             
        - Come on, hide.        
        - Did he see us?        
        - I don't know.         
 - But he's coming this way.    
 - [Tia] who is he?             
 - [muscles] our worst enemy.   
 - He's worse than the goons.   
 [Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto,     
 the truant officer.            
         He's trying to make us 
         go back to school.     
     [dazzler] let's go.        
         [all] yeah!            
             That's our hideout.
     [stairs creaking]          
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?            
        [Rocky] don't say things
        like that.              
        This place could        
        really scare ya.        
            [gasps]             
Come on.                        
 This is where we're gonna live 
 when we run away from home.    
        Yeah, you can't be tough
     If you take orders from    
     your mom or older sister.  
        That's why              
        we quit school.         
     You can't be tough         
     and educated, too.         
[crusher] yeah.                 
        - Tony!                 
        - [boys] where?         
 I had a contact with him.      
You...                          
You calling on the spirits?     
             Shh.               
        - She's weird.          
        - She's creepy.         
    I... I ain't too sure       
    I wanna meet this Tony.     
             Shh!               
     Tony, where are you?       
     He's coming in again.      
    I can only see a light.     
    That's all.                 
    Now it's... Going black.    
 Now it's... Completely gone.   
     [machines beeping]         
                He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes            
As he struggles to regain consciousness.        
His output is so great,         
That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it.   
             But he's dangerous.
Once I have control of his brain, Letha,            
He will only be dangerous to others.         
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
My experiments are more important than the law, Letha.  
With these receptors placed on certain people,       
Combined with this boy's powers,              
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.   
         Oh, you are absolutely 
         brilliant, professor.  
             Now we can go ahead
             with my plans, too.
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant.     
 A comment, perhaps, on you and 
 the life you've been leading.  
             Now, you look here,
    Doctor, professor,          
    physicist. Whatever you are.
     I built this laboratory    
     for you at great expense.  
     I used every penny I had.  
 Now, we've made a lot of plans 
 and I won't let you upset them.
        I want some money. Fast.
Letha, we are worlds apart.                   
My mind is filled with large concepts.            
Mankind, the universe.          
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.      
            Sure, I gamble...   
     ...But with my own money.  
                You're the worst
                kind of gambler.
            You use             
            other people's money
     And want to keep all       
     the winnings for yourself. 
         Well, you can be sure  
         of one thing, Victor.  
     I'll be around to pick up  
     the chips with you.        
    - [wires pop and sizzle]    
    - [Tony moans]              
         [panting]              
         [grunting]             
    We'll be back in the morning
    with maps and breakfast.    
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.           
             And I'll bring some
             day-old bread.     
- I'll bring some milk for you. 
- Thank you.                    
 - You're good friends.         
 - That's the trouble with us.  
 We don't want to be good.      
 We want to be bad.             
             Yeah.              
 Hey, uh, let's go, you guys.   
 My mom's gonna yell at me.     
[crusher] see you tomorrow,     
Tia.                            
 [muscles] we'll find Tony      
 tomorrow for sure.             
 [Rocky] let's stay close       
 together on the way out, guys. 
            [sighs]             
                         Good.  
             This is            
             professor Gannon...
             ...Commanding you  
             to awaken.         
[indistinct shouting]           
                         Tony!  
 He's in some kind of a room.   
                Like a hospital.
     With machines              
     and instruments and things.
Oh, that's easy.                
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.     
     While we going around      
     looking for a fight.       
            Come on.            
 [victor] you will now function 
 exclusively under control.     
            You will no longer  
            think independently.
     All thinking and reasoning 
     will be done               
             By the voice       
             that commands you. 
             Do you understand? 
     - Yes.                     
     - What is your name?       
     - Tony.                    
     - Where are you from?      
Witch mountain.                 
        Sounds like             
        some hick town to me.   
         How did you suspend    
         Mr. Sickle in mid-air? 
     By energizing matter.      
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow? 
         Yes, sir.              
- How did you learn to do this? 
- I was born with the ability.  
 I wish to see a demonstration  
 of molecular flow.             
                You are strapped
                to the table.   
             Unbuckle yourself  
             and sit up.        
         Power has come         
         into our hands         
     Which is centuries         
     before its time.           
We must use it wisely.          
                Well, what can  
                you have him do?
     Other than go around making
     people's belts unbuckle.   
The possibilities are unlimited.
     Oh, come on. It's just     
     some gimmick, that's all.  
Tony...                         
         Mr. Sickle,            
         whose life you saved,  
             Doesn't seem       
             to believe in you. 
         Mr. Sickle             
         needs convincing, Tony.
[knob squeaks]                  
         [gas hissing]          
         Hey, come on.          
Hey, get back!                  
     Get back! Get back!        
Don't.                          
[grunting] get back!                       
[goat bleats]                   
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention. 
But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?   
[goat bleats]                   
     I will demonstrate         
     an industrial application. 
Come with me, Tony.             
         [gas continues to hiss]
             Now, Tony,         
             those wine casks...
         Stack them... Neatly.  
            Two glasses         
            of burgundy, please.
                 To molecular   
                 mobilization.  
 To molecular capitalization.   
        - [goat bleats]         
        - [gas hisses]          
[muscles] hey, got any more clues?             
             No.                
        Nothing at all.         
        It's so strange.        
 We've been to every hospital   
 and he's in none of them.      
             It's like          
             his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.           
 - Don't listen to him.         
 - We'll find Tony for sure.    
     Yeah, we'll turn           
     the town upside down.      
Yeah.                           
 - [sickle] what're you doing?  
 - [Letha] thinking.            
Thinking about us in a different place, such as...   
Las Vegas...                    
...With Tony.                   
             Seven or eleven    
             every time, right? 
A day at the races.             
             All the long shots  
             come in.           
[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all.      
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.        
For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them.  
If he can stack them, he can unstack them.            
         The gold is on display 
         at the museum.         
    Protected by an impenetrable
    security system.            
             Just sitting there 
             waiting for us...  
             ...To penetrate it.
Wait a minute. Us?              
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?     
 Professor Gannon is            
 extremely busy being a genius. 
 I own half the invention,      
 Half of Tony, that means       
 I own half of the profits.     
     So far, the return on      
     my investment has been     
     half of zero.              
What about security. We'd need an army to pull it off.    
     We'll have an army with us!
             Tony.              
         [chuckles]             
              Tony?             
              Tony?             
      Tony, why can't I         
      get through to you?       
              Tony?             
I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops.  
Be back later on.               
            [Letha] don't worry.
                 Everything's   
                 under control. 
            Tony.               
            This is Letha wedge,
             Commanding you     
             to open your eyes. 
                 Now, stand up. 
     We're going to the museum  
     for education and profit.  
        [brakes squeak]         
        Tony and I will do      
        a little... Sightseeing.
     [indistinct chatter]       
                     [Tia] wait.
     Gold! I see gold.          
        - Hey it's mine.        
        - Where is it?          
     - Hey, give it to me!      
     - No!                      
         A stagecoach.          
     She must be tuned in       
     on a western.              
                         Yeah.  
         I see dummies.         
     [both] that's you.         
        No. Old things.         
                     Clothing.  
             Hey, he's at       
             the salvation army.
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army.          
            They don't got gold,
            neither.            
                Wait a minute,  
                wait a minute!  
         We had one of them     
         nothing school trips.  
                 To the museum. 
                 Yeah, they got 
                 a pile of gold.
And a stagecoach.               
They had to kick me out.        
     We've got to go there.     
                 Come on,       
                 it's over here.
        [kids grunting]         
     [indistinct chatter]       
        [tires screech]         
Now, Tony.                      
We're going to create a little diversion.             
The stagecoach.                 
I want you to roll it all around the museum.          
[woman gasps]                   
[woman] look out.               
                 [man] watch it.
[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way.           
Hey, where are the horses?                     
                I... Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.          
                [man] watch out.
            [yelps]             
Short circuit the control system.             
    [control system buzzes]     
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [guard screams]         
            Oh, no.             
             Letha!             
             Letha!             
     [indistinct shouting]      
[chortling]                     
         - [gasps]              
         - look out.            
        [man] get out of my way.
         [moaning]              
         [guards yell]          
[man] can't you put that thing out?                 
Come on, take a shot.           
Move it.                        
Now, Tony,                      
Make a hole in the plastic shield.          
And it doesn't have to be neat. 
Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 
 [man] move it buddy, move it.  
 We gotta get out of here!      
Las Vegas, here we come.                   
             Oh!                
     - Look.                    
     - [bars thudding]          
                     Come on,   
                     follow me. 
Tony, make them go faster.                      
     [woman] watch out!         
    Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha!     
     - [woman screams]          
     - [man] hey!               
     [indistinct chatter]       
        Look out, lady.         
Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy.    
            [gasps]             
     [man] look out, Eddie!     
[Letha] Tony, what's happening? 
[Tony] molecular flow reversing.
     - Are you doing this?      
     - No.                      
Then who is?                    
             It would have to be
             one of my people.  
 - There are more like you?     
 - Yes.                         
 - Oh! Let's get out of here.   
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
             Tony!              
Who's that?                     
                 It's my sister.
                 My sister, Tia.
This is no time for a family reunion.           
     [crowd murmuring]          
[victor] Letha!                 
             Tony!              
         [victor] you fool!     
         How could you do this? 
        [Letha] not now.        
     - [door shuts]             
     - [engine sticking]        
        - What's wrong?         
        - I don't know.         
 I keep it running perfect.     
It's Tony's sister, she did it. 
She's as weird as he is.        
     Tony, I command you to     
     make this car run perfectly
 And continuously without       
 interference from your sister. 
        [engine starts]         
     I can't stop the car.      
     Tony's energizing it.      
         It's like your brother 
         doesn't even know you. 
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo. Let's go! 
- No. Don't run.                
     You crazy? You don't want  
     to go to that school.      
     Please, trust me.          
     Now, come on, hurry.       
 [Rocky] hey, wait for me.      
 [dazzler] come on, you guys.   
 Get in there.                  
     - Let's go!                
     - Come on, get in.         
        - [door shuts]          
        - I'm dreaming.         
 You're surrendering            
 to the board of education?     
Sir, you see that car going down the street?          
     - Yeah.                    
     - My brother's in it.      
He ought to be going to school. 
You ought to catch up with him. 
    Another truant? Oh, boy,    
    we're gonna have a load.    
     - Hey, what happened?      
     - Good driving, yo-yo.     
Yeah, that was neat.            
             [laughs] this bus  
             can really move.   
             Tony, look         
             through the window.
                The rear window.
                That minibus    
                is following us.
         I command you to place 
         obstacles in its path. 
         [tires squeal]         
     City property.             
     I've damaged city property.
                     [moaning]  
[panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof.
 Was that a bus or a bridge?    
         They're still with us. 
        Tony, you must stop her.
Man, that man was really buzzing.                 
     Am I still alive?          
        [tires screech]         
         They're gaining on us. 
     She counteracts            
     everything that Tony does. 
                Tony, you've    
                got to stop her.
                        We flew!
        [boys cheering]         
             They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.                    
     Sickle... Sickle, stop...  
     Stop over that hill.       
 Tony, cause the reflection     
 of the sun on the rear window  
             To magnify and     
             shine so brightly  
            That our pursuers'll
            be blinded by it.   
        [glass breaking]        
             [van scrapes road] 
[muscles] come on, open the doors.                 
     [crusher] I can't see.     
- [Tia] yeah.                   
- [muscles] come on, let me out.
    - Everybody ok?             
    - [all kids] yeah, sure.    
        Oh, look what's happened
        to city property.       
No... But I'm still gonna take you to school.       
     - Just soon as I...        
     - Come on.                 
     [siren approaching]        
You jeopardized my life's work. 
My accountants' are desperate.                  
         You've proved yourself 
         incompetent yet again. 
        I don't even know if    
        I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?             
I trusted you enough            
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.         
Don't tell me you don't trust me.             
We have to trust each other.               
     Right.                     
     I trust everybody.         
             Yes...             
             Well, fortunately, 
         I thought of something 
         very spectacular       
 Which will satisfy both of us  
 in terms of prestige and money.
Well, you have the prestige,    
I'll take the money.            
But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,          
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.            
     How did she know           
     we were at the museum?     
                I...            
                I'm not certain.
Tony.                           
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?     
         Telepathy.             
            She'll show up again
            and ruin everything.
In that case, she will have to be, as you would say... 
...Scratched?                   
     [Tony whispering] Tia.     
          [louder] Tia.         
              Tia!              
  [Tia] what happened to you?   
  [Tony] I can't explain now.   
     I've lost                  
     the power to energize.     
      [Tia] where are you?      
  [Tony] follow my voice path.  
  Please!                       
      [Tia] ok. Guide me.       
         [dog barks]            
      Tony, which way?          
              [Tony] this way.  
        [sirens blaring]        
      Which way, Tony?          
      Which way?                
 [Tony] keep moving             
 straight ahead.                
      This is the house.        
          Here, look.           
          Come on.              
        - [door closes]         
        - down here.            
                 [goat bleats]  
     Be quiet, Alfred,          
     you silly thing.           
          [Tony] Tia!           
             Tony!              
            [yells]             
         [gas hissing]          
     I've put her into a state  
     of comatose neutralization.
 [crusher] hey, Tia.            
 We got you some cold hotcakes. 
        She ain't here.         
 Hope she didn't go             
 looking for Tony without us.   
             Yeah, she needs us.
      [Tia] Tony? Crusher?      
         Muscles? Rocky?        
      - Dazzler?                
      - [Alfred bleats]         
             Alfred.            
  Alfred,                       
  what's the matter with me?    
          Where am I?           
  Alfred, find the earthquakes. 
         [bleating]             
         Listen to me.          
         [bleating]             
    [hoof steps approaching]     
         [bleating]             
     [sickle] what kind         
     of place is that?          
 [victor] that is an underground
 plutonium processing plant.    
         Translate that         
         into financial terms.  
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.        
             That's why         
             I like scientists. 
     They're always discovering 
     new, expensive things.     
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.    
             I suppose you're   
             going to have Tony 
             Split an atom bomb 
             or something.      
In effect...                    
...Yes                          
         Well, I didn't count on
         killing anybody.       
             Especially not us. 
It will never go that far.      
They will pay anything to prevent it.         
This is the first step towards my becoming             
The most powerful man in the world.                   
         Ids, please.           
         Take a powder.         
                     [laughing] 
Tony.                           
Those are the outer security scanners.        
 Put them out of commission...  
        ...Permanently.         
            [static]            
            The scanning systems
            are malfunctioning. 
            All right, let's run
            a maintenance check.
Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right.  
    - Where to?                 
    - Andy's place, know it?    
Yeah, sure. I know where everything is. Second and third?
 - [man] fourth and market.     
 - That one.                    
 - Hop in.                      
 - I'm in a hurry. Could you... 
            [grunts]            
        - Don't worry.          
        - [tires screech]       
    Have you there              
    in a couple of minutes.     
[Alfred bleats]                 
            Listen.             
 Feel the power in this cab?    
    - [Alfred bleats]           
    - it has lots of power.     
 You know, everybody tells me,  
 I ought to be a race driver.   
     - What do you think?       
     - [bleats]                 
 Well, I think you're wrong.    
Don't worry about nothing, sir. 
I'm a very safe driver.         
- Want me to tell you how safe? 
- [Alfred bleating]             
     I'll tell you anyway.      
 I've been driving a hack       
 for 19 years and 11 months.    
 And in all that time, I never  
 even put one scratch on a cab. 
     In fact, next month,       
     They're gonna give me      
     a gold safety award.       
 - What do you think of that?   
 - [bleating]                   
 Boy, you don't like nothing.   
     - I sure hope              
     you're a good tipper.      
     - [bleats]                 
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.     
     [tires screeching]         
[cabbie] hey!                   
             Hey!               
     You owe me a fare!         
                 [cabbie sighs] 
 - Officer, that goat's a guy.  
 - The goat?                    
         The guy became a goat  
         when I'm driving.      
The guy?                        
     This magician              
     beat me out of this fare.  
The magician?                   
    - My perfect record.        
    - Record? Oh... Record.     
         I ain't gonna get      
         the gold safety award. 
 - [hoof steps approaching]      
 - hear that? That must be her. 
         - [bleats]             
         - come on.             
 [boys grunting and panting]    
     [dazzler] help me.         
[grunts] hey. Watch out.        
        - [bleating]            
        - get him away.         
    - [moans]                   
    - how'd you get in here?    
        Hey, come on,           
        get out of here.        
[Rocky] watch out!              
             He's looking at me 
             like he knows me.  
 Hey, what do you want from me? 
                     Get away!  
     He's got Tia's vest.       
            Get him!            
             Quick.             
  - [phone ringing]             
  - we're going for coffee now. 
    - [phone ringing]           
    - can I bring you a cup?    
     May I see your ids, please?
Tony?                           
Show him our id.                
     What's happening?          
Why?                            
    Don't leave me up here.     
                Open the door,  
                Tony.           
     You can't go in there      
     without ids.               
     - Now seal it.             
     - How do I get down?       
         [boys panting]         
             Tia!               
 - Quick, let's get her out.    
 - Yeah.                        
     - Phew, it smells.         
     - [boys cough]             
It's some kind of a gas.                       
Come on.                        
        [inhales deeply]        
         You ok now?            
        Yes, thank you.         
    This is some kind of...     
     ...Science place.          
     - How'd you get here?      
     - It was Tony.             
                    He was here.
        I saw something!        
         What was it?           
        It's where Tony is.     
        I'm sure of it!         
     A big, round shape.        
A doughnut!                     
He's eating a doughnut.         
No way!                         
     Is it like a ball?         
     A great big ball?          
     - Yes.                     
     - I know where he is.      
         Let's go!              
        Hurry, let's go.        
                 [Alfred bleats]
     Oh, thank you.             
     And thanks for everything. 
     Come on, let's go.         
We are about to make scientific history.     
         [Letha] and some money,
         too, I hope.           
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.  
[alarm ringing]                 
It's a red light on the cooling system.          
     It must be                 
     a circuit breaker.         
     Restart the system.        
I can't get a restart.          
         Hit the backup system. 
It's no-go on backup.           
Temperature increasing in the furnace.                 
 - Get that coolant flowing.    
 - [phone buzzes]               
     - Furnace control.         
     - Control?                 
 You don't really think you're  
 controlling anything, do you?  
 - [alarm continues buzzing]    
 - who is this?                 
      [victor] this is          
      Dr. Victor Gannon,        
  And I have just shut down     
  your cooling system.          
        Ok, you've shut it down.
        Get it back on again!   
        Tell him how expensive  
        it is to put it back on.
In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium,      
Medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met.   
        What conditions?        
Five million dollars in cash.                        
A jet waiting at the airport.   
A safe escort, of course.       
And most important of all,      
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon          
Has achieved molecular control and mind control.               
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.    
        [line cuts out]         
 How long does it take          
 to count five million dollars? 
        [alarm ringing]         
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [siren wailing]         
     [indistinct shouting]      
     [machines beeping]         
We'll have to pay them.         
 Evacuate the immediate area.   
 Put Los Angeles on alert.      
         [horn honking]         
There's the big round ball.                 
 - Is that it?                  
 - No, it was bigger than that. 
        Get outta here.         
            Leave me alone.     
            At least I tried.   
                     Hey, look. 
It's yo-yo.                     
Let's get out of here.          
            Come on.            
             [radio plays music]
 Hey, yo-yo.                    
 Don't you want to catch us?    
I don't trust him.              
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.    
            Come on.            
[dazzler] hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?     
        It's not my job anymore.
             They're coming down
             to fire me...      
             ...For destroying  
             city property.     
The only thing that works is the radio. And it won't turn off.   
     I was only trying          
     to help you kids.          
         Mr. Yokomoto,          
 I'm sorry about                
 everything that's happened.    
 All I ever wanted in life      
Was all you kids that           
I put back in school, someday...
     ...Visit me and say,       
 "thanks Mr. Yo-yo, Yokomoto.   
 If it wasn't for you           
 forcing us to get an education,
    We would've been bums."     
     That's all I wanted.       
You see?                        
I told you he was gonna...      
 ...Hit us with                 
 some of that heavy psychology. 
     I mean, I feel guilty.     
     [man on radio] bulletin    
     from the plutonium plant.  
  Unless the demands            
  of the terrorists are met,    
 The furnace will explode       
 with the force of ten megatons.
  An official describes         
  the atomic furnace controls   
  as frozen in position,        
 - As if "the molecular flow..."
 - that's Tony!                 
- The plant is being evacuated. 
- That's where he is!           
    - We've got to go there.    
    - How? Take a bus?          
 - We'll go in this.            
 - Tia, the tires are flat.     
            Come on.            
        [tires screech]         
     [machine beeping]          
If it doesn't start cooling soon,             
The chain reaction will start.                     
                 You hear that? 
                 In ten minutes,
     This place is going to be  
     a hole in the ground.      
     Now, let's be reasonable.  
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.    
 And the balance is on the way. 
                    It's a deal.
I do not compromise.            
     [alarm continues]          
- Hey, what are you guys doing? 
- [man] nothing! Nothing!       
     We're doing nothing.       
         - Hey, kids!           
         - [man grunts]         
How did these children get past security?              
 Sir, the people destroying the 
 furnace kidnapped my brother.  
             If I could see him,
             I might stop them. 
    - [boys] she can do it!     
    - She can do it.            
        - [alarm beeps]         
        - do what?              
Impossible, they're inside the room.        
They've sealed the door somehow.               
- What part has to be fixed?    
- The emergency cooling system. 
     - Where is it?             
     - Five levels down.        
But it's too late. We've already begun to evacuate the plant.    
Tony's here, all right.                      
         Get me down.           
 Thank you, thank you.          
 Now, where are you going?      
                     In there.  
Oh, no. You can't go beyond this point without ids.  
 - [footsteps approaching]      
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
         - Tia!                 
         - I knew it.           
 She'll spoil everything.       
 I can just taste that money.   
     We cannot let her          
     take it away from us.      
                         Tony!  
 Tony, from this moment         
 you will no longer hear Tia.   
    She cannot break through    
    my power of control.        
 - Acknowledge.                 
 - [Tia] Tony, what's wrong?    
          It's me, your sister. 
             Try to remember me.
         Acknowledge.           
              Tony?             
     - Yes, sir.                
     - Get those kids.          
        She'll use some of those
        molecules on us.        
I'll take care of her before she gets a Chance, you get them.
 [Tia] I can't get through.     
     I don't know what          
     they've done to his mind.  
 We've got to find the emergency
 cooling system ourselves.      
 How do you spell cooling?      
                        Come on.
     - [Tia] uh-oh.             
     - [muscles] whoa.          
             [Rocky] look out.  
     [rapid footsteps approach] 
    We've got to find           
    the emergency switches.     
    You two go that way,        
    and you two go that way.    
                 Tony, we must  
                 eliminate Tia. 
[footsteps approach]            
 You will cause that portable   
 utility panel to run her down. 
     - Hey, Tia, come here.     
     - [machines whirring]      
            Come on.            
     That ain't it, right?      
     - [Tia] you found it!      
     - I knew it was it!        
     But, it's spelt wrong.     
            You guys get        
            dazzler and muscles.
         Ok. Come on.           
                 [door opening] 
         The rest of the money's
         just arrived.          
         All right.             
    I'd better call Gannon.     
The cooling system's on.        
         Switch it off.         
     [man] we lost it!          
 What's going on down there?    
             It's coming back.  
            Gotcha!             
    Tony, you must stop her.    
             Tony, why are you  
             doing these things?
    Why are you using           
    your powers against me?     
                What's happened?
                         Tony...
                ...Pretend      
                to remember Tia.
     Lure her to the            
     center of the room and...  
             ...Make that crane 
             drop on her.       
             Tia!               
 I'm starting to remember.      
                What was the    
                matter with you?
I don't know, exactly... But... 
         I need help.           
     Don't go any closer.       
     Why? What is it, Tony?     
         Tony, stop it!         
         Stop it, Tony, stop it!
Exert a force greater than hers.              
 Why are you doing this, Tony?  
 Stop.                          
                    Crush her.  
                    Kill her!   
                     Crush her! 
         Crush her! Crush her!  
                     Finish her!
     - Now!                     
     - [Tony groaning]          
Tia.                            
Where are we?                   
What's happened?                
        [victor screams]        
         - Ha!                  
         - [boys yell]          
                 [victor] Tony. 
     Tony, we can still do it.  
         We can still make use  
         of molecular control.  
Ok, doc, let's do it.                    
         [moaning]              
         [grunting]             
            [footsteps approach]
         [boys pant]            
        [victor] Letha!         
    Why don't we                
    all go and have some...     
     Some candy and, uh,        
     sodas and ice cream?       
[Letha moans]                   
                    Next time...
     - ...Next time I'll...     
     - Forget it.               
I've lost my faith in science.  
     - [sickle grunts]          
     - huh?                     
         [boys moan]            
        [victor] sickle!        
[moaning]                       
        Aunt Letha!             
        Oh, aunt Letha.         
             Help.              
     [gasping] aunt Letha?      
     Aunt Letha?                
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.            
     - Come on.                 
     - [engine shuts off]       
         Tony, the bus won't run
         without me in it.      
             It's all my fault. 
             It's such a mess.  
Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it.            
             I'm sure Uncle Bene
             won't mind.        
         I'll do the engine.    
         You do the body work.  
     - Ok.                      
     - So long, Alfie.          
     - Goodbye, Alfred.         
     - [blows kiss]             
[bleats]                        
     What job will you do now,  
     Mr. Yo-yo, uh, Yokomoto?   
    Oh, I've saved my money.    
    I'll probably open          
    a Japanese delicatessen.    
     - [metal scraping]         
     - hey, kids, look.         
    I don't understand this.    
     - Man!                     
     - Wow, what a family.      
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...        
 - ...Somehow.                  
 - Uh, that's a possibility.    
     You know what this means?  
     They never saw the wreck.  
 I'll tell them that the reports
 were exaggerated.              
         And, if you kids       
         will go back to school,
                 I'm sure they  
                 won't fire me. 
You will go back to school, won't you?                      
         Well, if we was        
         to go back to school,  
         Could we get as smart  
         as Tia and Tony?       
     - Maybe even smarter.      
     - Yeah, sure.              
Let's give it a shot.           
             Great.             
 I hope the school can take it. 
     - Goodbye, yo-yo.          
     - Goodbye.                 
- [Rocky] see you later, yo-yo. 
- You promised.                 
     Tia, open the gate.        
 No, everybody join hands.      
            - Whoa.             
            - Wow.              
         [boys] cool!           
[muscles] all right!            
Wow! Flying saucer!             
Will we ever see you again?                  
                 Well, it's...  
                    It's kind of
                    hard to say.
Thanks for everything.          
     And especially for         
     letting me be in your gang.
Take care of Alfred for me, ok?                     
         [all laugh]            
There you are.                  
    - Where's your luggage?     
    - Uh, we lost it.           
                 There were     
                 a few problems.
    - But you did have fun?     
    - Oh, terrible.             
I just knew we should have gone surfing.       
     [mechanical whirring]      
         [all] wow.             
Hey. Let's do it the way        
Tia and Tony taught us.         
         [all] yeah.            
    - Ready?                    
    - [all] one, two, three!    
         [all grunt]            
         - Hey, yo-yo!          
         - Yo-yo!               
         [panting] guess what!  
     Tia and Tony just drove off
     in a flying saucer.        
        - Flying saucer?        
        - Whoosh!               
Whoosh?                         
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?          
                 But, it's true.
    Lookit, I saw those two kids
    do miraculous things.       
I believe anything and everything, except that. Get in.
     I hope this school teaches 
     about flying saucers.      
Yeah.                           
                Flying saucers. 
                [laughs]

Hi, Mark.
Come on, Jen.
It's almost over.
I'll be there in a minute.
I told Steve I'd wait for him.
I suppose he's at that crummy night school again.
Roger, everyone can't be a Stanford man.
Unfortunately.
But he drives everyone nuts.
Especially Uncle.
Well, he won't bother him tonight.
Anyone who graduates from the Moonrise Night School on Melrose Avenue is certainly not gonna make it at the network.
- Hi, Rog.
- Steve, it's about time.
Yeah. We had this guest lecturer.
This guy had a great idea about a story on Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog.
It was a great idea.
- Don't mention it tonight.
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey, how's the show going?
- Not very well.
- I haven't heard any laughs.
- I'm not surprised.
I saw it, it's a bomb.
If Wilbanks'd just listen to me.
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
- Who's saying anything?
- Shh.
Thank you. Thank you.
How'd you like...? What did you...?
Did you...?
Harry, what did you think?
Regardless of my personal feelings, Mr. Wilbanks,
I think this show will have a very good rating.
What do you mean, "regardless of your personal feelings"?
Well, I... I just don't happen to like TV very much, that's all.
He doesn't like TV.
He's the morning program director.
- Steve, please be quiet.
- Charming.
- I mean, simply charming.
- Ahhh.
- Loved it.
- Thank you.
- Some of them liked it.
- Jen, telephone.
Of course they seemed to like it.
He's vice president in charge of programming.
Can you imagine what he'd do if someone didn't seem to like it?
Yes, operator. Mr. Wilbanks, international calling.
- It's Farnsworth.
- Farnsworth. That vulture.
- Now, really, he isn't that bad.
- Yes, he is. I know that man.
Every time he thinks I'm in trouble, he calls me up and congratulates me.
I tell you, he does it every time.
Hello, Farnsworth.
What a show, Francis.
What a show.
- Thank you, Farnsworth.
- It was so, so... different.
- Different?
- Yes, absolutely.
Incidentally, Clifford dropped by.
He sends regards from his entire staff at Continental.
- Hiya, Francis.
- Hello, Clifford.
Well, I'm glad you liked it, Farnsworth, because, you see, what I was trying to do...
We'll have lunch and talk about it.
Well, good night, Francis, you old scoundrel.
You've done it again.
Well, I know I'm in trouble.
They both congratulated me.
Oh, well, don't worry. It's what our big brass thinks that counts.
But what do they think?
There hasn't been a word from New York. Roger!
- Yes, sir?
- Don't sneak up on me.
Get me New York.
They're lolling around there in the lap of luxury.
We put on a new show.
The president of the network doesn't call and tell me what he thinks of it.
- Hi-line, Crampton, New York.
- Good boy. He gets right...
- What did you think of it?
- Oh, well, the...
- The audience liked it.
- Yes, they did.
But I'm still worried.
Uncle Francis, I think you always over-worry our first show.
Is that what you think?
Well, let's hope that's the case this time.
Yes, sir, here he is.
Hello, chief!
How'd you like the show?
Just fine, Wilbanks. Fine!
Is there somebody there with you?
Our sponsors are here.
They watched the show with me.
Oh, the sponsors are there. Well, what did they think of the show?
They thought it was fine too, just fine.
- How'd the showing go out there?
- Fine, just fine.
Several people laughed so hard they fell off their chairs.
In fact, some of them are still applauding.
Well, the ratings will be out in the morning.
- They'll tell us the story, Francis.
- Yes, they certainly will.
- Good night, Francis.
- Good night, chief.
Cut!
Not now, for heaven's sakes.
Ratings. That's all they think about are ratings.
We get great audience response.
You heard them clapping yourself.
And they're worried about the ratings.
It's enough to give a man nervous prostration.
You look a little pale.
Maybe I should get your pills.
Yes, I feel a little pale.
Get my pills.
Love that casting, Francis.
Love that casting!
Yeah, wasn't it good? The fellow with the hat? Didn't you like him?
Oh, Jen, uh, what'd you think of the show?
Well, I thought it had certain possibilities.
Did you? I'm glad to hear...
- I thought next time, you could...
- Post! Not tonight!
Oh, he never listens.
He'll never listen!
Steve, did you slip him a note?
Jen, all he needs is one good program idea.
Steve!
Mertons, will you stop blowing that infernal horn?
- Wanted you to know I was here.
- I know you're here.
The neighborhood knows. You'd think you were picking up your date.
And will you stop with the dusting?
I'm in a hurry today!
Yes, boss.
Charlie, get off your bicycle, and put that paper on the porch.
I'm just sick and tired of digging it out of the bushes every day.
Careless, incompetent kids, grow up that way, then come to the networks.
No wonder we're having these problems.
Say, boss, would you ask Wilma to move her car?
No, Wilma can't move her car!
You've got a reverse gear in this thing.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, my bike!
- My bike! My brand-new bike!
- Now look what you've done.
Yeah, careless, incompetent kids, huh?
Not him. You!
Well, don't worry about the bike...
But the papers.
If I don't deliver them,
I won't win that trip to Catalina.
I've been working all year on that trip to Catalina.
Well, he's been working all year on the...
Oh, put the darn papers in the car!
How I ever let myself get saddled with my wife's relatives, I'll never know.
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi, Jen.
I, uh, got something here for Wilbanks.
Steve, you're supposed to deliver the mail, not read it.
- It doesn't hurt anything.
- Keep moving.
Mr. Wilbanks should be here any second.
You know how upset he gets when he sees you hanging around.
- He's not in yet?
- Mm-mm.
I can't say I blame him after that show last night.
Steve, please just forget about last night's show.
Okay. I've seen disasters in my time, but that one really takes the cake.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Did you happen to get my note?
- Yes.
Every time I put my hand in my pocket, I got your note.
Now you listen to me, Steven. I'm not interested in your theories on ratings.
And I'm certainly not interested in doing a show called
Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog, whatever that is.
What is it?
Uh, well, sir, it's very interesting.
You see, we had a guest speaker from our school last night.
A Mr. E.Z. Potter.
You've probably heard of him.
- E.Z. Potter?
- Yes. He's from up north.
- Up north? Where up north?
- Tulare.
- Tulare?
- Yeah.
He's got a surefire approach for making a top-rated TV show.
- He does?
- And it's very logical too.
It's been historically proven that the American people have always preferred stories about, number one, Abe Lincoln, number two, doctors and number three, dogs.
So the most popular and highest rated show of all, would be a show about
Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog.
And that is the kind of a show your TV friend from Tulare wants me to make?
Well, actually, he's not in TV, sir. He's in radio.
- Radio?
- Yes.
- They don't have a TV station up there.
- They don't?
Abraham Lincoln's doctor's dog?
- Yeah.
- Title's kinda long, but it sounds like a good idea.
- Wait in the car.
- Oh.
Now you listen to me, Post.
You get this straight.
Your job here is to deliver the mail.
And that is all you are to do is to deliver the mail.
I am not interested in your quacky theories that come from your quacky teachers that teach in your quacky night school.
Yes, sir. But actually, in this case, it wasn't a teacher.
I know what he was!
He was a radio man from Tulare!
Anything important, Jen?
Oh, yes, sir. Mr. Crampton called from New York.
He did?
Well, why didn't you tell me that?
When the president of the network calls, don't let me stand around talking about
Abraham Lincoln's dog's doctor.
Uh, Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog, sir.
There's a difference.
I don't care what it is.
How long ago did he call?
- About an hour ago.
- An hour?
You should've called me at home.
Well, I did, but you weren't there.
Your wife said you were out on some deliveries.
Oh, yeah... deliveries, yeah.
Well, get him on the phone.
He said it wouldn't be necessary to call back.
Just pick him up at the airport next Tuesday.
He didn't want to talk to me?
Did he see the ratings?
I imagine he had, because he asked if you had.
- He did? Where are they?
- No, they're in the other pile.
Why didn't you say so?
I'm under pressure.
- Well, he's sure in a bad mood.
- Steve!
Why did you bring up Abe Lincoln's doctor's dog on a day like this?
- Oh, no!
- I was just trying to help.
Nothing wrong with that.
Oh, these are terrible!
These are catastrophic!
- Just relax. You'll be fine.
- Oh, sure.
You just got excited. You took too much oxygen in your system.
I had an aunt who had that problem.
Used to help to blow into a paper bag. Ever tried?
I never tried that. Helped?
- She just blew right in...
- Yes.
- Don't you have anything to do?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, do it!
- I'll see you tonight, Jen.
Jen, you know I never interfere in the personal lives of my employees, but...
... how can you stand that boy? Blow into a paper bag.
I don't know. I guess
I'm just kind of hooked, sir.
There, there, Mama.
Everything is gonna be all right.
You'll get over it, Mama.
Don't worry.
What's the matter?
We've got to go to San Francisco.
Hi. Hey, what's the matter with the Bernaduccis?
They have to go to San Francisco.
That's what they said. So what's the matter with San Francisco?
Hey, what's everybody sniffling about?
Mr. Bernaducci's been transferred.
With all that fog and dampness, they can't take Raffles.
- He gets colds too easily.
- Oh.
And after having him all these years.
Don't take it so hard.
What'd they do, stick him in a zoo?
- No.
- Did they put him away or something?
No, not that!
Jen, you didn't take him?
Oh, no!
Well, I couldn't let them put him in a zoo.
I'd have found that real easy to do.
- Do you think he'll be happy here?
- I don't know why you're bothering.
He'll be nothing but trouble.
Steve!
Will you listen to me?
He only had three people in this world up until tonight.
- Mr. And Mrs. Bernaducci and me.
- Aw.
Now he only has me and I'm not going to let him down.
You're treating him like a human being.
He's just a hard-to-get-along-with, miserable, spoiled chimp!
Seems to me you're the one acting hard to get along with.
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, can we just stick him in the bedroom?
I'm not going to do any such thing.
He has been through enough today without locking him in some bedroom.
Now you just go in and watch TV with him while I finish dinner.
- What are you doing to him?
- I didn't do anything to him.
Oh, he can't see the TV from there.
"Mother Carey's Chickens."
I guess you know, you're witnessing one of the wildest slam-bang football games played anywhere.
...snapped to Humphrey.
He fakes a handoff...
Leave it alone.
What did you do to him now?
Nothing.
I didn't do anything to him.
Oh, Steve.
You changed the station.
You can't do that.
What do you mean,
I can't do that?
If he likes a program and you change it, he gets all upset.
He does it to me all the time.
Well, he's not gonna do it to me. Jen.
Steve, just try and be a little patient, okay?
Patient, my foot.
You expect me to sit here and watch a lousy show called Mother Carey's Chickens?
Well, it's over anyway, so it doesn't make any difference.
It makes a lot of difference.
That chimp is spoiled rotten.
He's not spoiled. He's lonely.
Now, let him have his own way tonight, okay?
Steve, would you please pour the wine? Dinner's ready.
Stay tuned to this station for Star Journey which follows immediately.
Star Journey's coming on.
They expect that to rate number one.
Oh, good. I want to see that.
...episode of The Maxwell Family, the program for all ages.
Maxwells. If you think we're gonna watch that soap opera, you're crazy.
- What happened now?
- It's that creep.
He doesn't want to watch Star Journey.
- Steve, he's not a creep.
- Well, he sure acts like one.
He did it again.
Jen, will you do something?
Steve, just let him have his own way tonight, okay?
You mean we can't watch Star Journey on account of that crummy chimp?
Just tonight. Please?
All right.
With all the pets in the world, you gotta end up with a chimp that likes bad TV!
Mother Carey's Chickens and The Maxwell Family?
Well, who would ever figure that those two shows would end up on top?
Nobody in this town, that's for sure.
- Oh, hi, Rog.
- Keep moving.
Mother Carey's Chickens and The Maxwell Family?
Huh. Hmm.
- Look, aren't these cute?
- Yeah, they're real cute.
- Steve, show some interest.
- I said, they're real cute.
I think I'll get them all.
Why don't you guys beat it, huh?
We like the chimp, mister.
Now don't do that.
Come on.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for watching The Fastest Gun.
It is your loyal viewing that has made our program one of America's top-rated shows.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd spend a little time with your roommate.
- Well, how'd you get in?
- The landlady.
- She's real nice.
- She sure is.
- Can you beat that?
- Beat what?
Oh, nothing.
- Hey, Jen?
- What?
I know we're gonna go out for supper tonight, but let's just skip it.
Well, how come?
Why should we?
Well, there's some shows
I wanted to see tonight.
We'll call Chicken Lickin', it'll be just as much fun, honest.
Why, that little son of a gun.
He picked them all!
7:30 to 12:00.
Holy smoke, he knows!
Jen?
- He knows.
- Who knows?
Animals.
Just like in the westerns.
Nobody sees the rattlesnake because he's hidden behind the sagebrush.
It's the horse who rears and saves the cowboy's life.
- He knows!
- I hope so.
Oh, you're gonna thank your lucky stars I came along.
You'll kiss the ground I walk on.
I will?
He knows. He knows!
If it happened once, it might be an accident.
But he picks the number one show every single night! He knows!
Hey. He knows.
- I'm gonna be rich.
- Well, that's just wonderful.
- Now may I see your driver's license?
- Sure.
Thank you. Okay.
You look just like a friend of mine.
- Steve!
- For you!
Oh, Steve, they're beautiful!
But you really shouldn't have spent the money.
Don't worry. There'll be a lot more where that came from.
You know, it's a funny thing. Everything seems to be going wrong for you.
One day you turn a corner and your whole life changes.
All of a sudden you got the world in your hip pocket.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Raffles?
Hey, uh, where is he, Jen?
- Oh, he's with Roger.
- Roger?
Yeah, they left about ten minutes ago.
Why? What for?
Where'd he go?
They went for a walk.
He went for a walk with that creep?
I told you before, he's not a creep!
How could you do this to me?
- Oh, hi, Rog.
- Hi. What are you doing here?
You were taking a walk.
I thought I'd join you.
You know, there is something really weird going on here.
Uh, what?
I... I think that chimp actually likes TV.
You've gotta be kidding.
No, he actually seems to be entertained.
- Look, he really likes it.
- No, no. It's just the lights.
Certain light attracts certain animals.
That's a scientific fact.
I never heard that.
You didn't know that?
I thought everybody knew that.
I learned that at Moonrise Night School.
On Melrose Avenue?
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
I've never seen him act like this.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything to him.
Look, he's gone mad!
Well, you must've stepped on his paw or something.
How could I step on his paw from over here?
Good heav...
Uh, excuse me. Here, let me help you. I'm terribly sorry.
Good. We got it.
Come on, fellow.
We're all through here.
Vicious little...
Keep that ape away from me.
- Come on. Over here.
- On the table.
Thank heaven you're here.
You can't believe what happened.
- We're not finished yet.
- Rog, don't worry about a thing.
We've got the bail.
We'll have you out in no time.
How could you let me be associated with a beast like that? He's a monster.
He's not a monster. Something just got into him, that's all.
Maybe he just doesn't like basketball.
Oh, he doesn't?
I happen to like it very...
That thing's not a monster?
That's gonna cost you 75 bucks.
- For what? That?
- Come on, fella.
It's gonna cost at least 75 bucks to get that thing fixed.
Okay. Who do I pay to bail the chimp out?
- We take care of it right here.
- Wait a minute. What about me?
Gee, I'm sorry, Rog.
I'm out of money.
I gotta get some more. Don't worry.
You're bailing that chimp out and letting me stay here in this dump?
Wait just a minute, mac.
This is a pretty nice place.
We happen to like it down here.
Well, you have to. I don't.
Steve, we aren't gonna leave Roger here?
Gee, we've gotta be realistic about this thing, Jen. I mean, uh...
It's Roger or the chimp, and this is no place for a chimp.
Well, it's no place for me, either!
Wave goodbye to Uncle Roger now.
Miserable chimp.
- Poor little guy.
- Poor little guy, my foot.
It's back to the Bernaduccis for him.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
You can't do that.
What are you getting excited about?
- I need him!
- You need him?
I mean,
I don't need him.
Why would you wanna give a poor little guy like this away?
I mean, that's inhumane!
Inhumane?
He's the one that's inhumane.
He's already broken two TV sets and a plate glass window.
Look, Jen, maybe he's trying to get something out of his system.
Just give him a few days.
He'll be okay.
Okay, I'll give him till Saturday.
Good. By Saturday, he'll be acting like a different chimp.
I guarantee it.
- I just can't understand it.
- Understand what?
Why he'd give me tickets to take you to the ball game.
That's because you don't understand Steve.
He has a lot of nice qualities about him.
Like what?
Well, he's charitable.
He gave you tickets to take me to the game.
Yeah, but I still think there's some motive behind that.
And he's honest.
Nobody can say he's not honest.
And as far as being trustworthy,
I don't know anyone
I would trust more than Steve.
And he's loyal and brave and...
Jen, will you forget it? You're making him sound like a boy scout.
Come on, Raffles.
You have to believe me. I've got a scientific approach to rating TV shows.
It'll revolutionize this whole industry.
We can put UBC right on top.
Jen, I'm going to be very busy today.
Will you see to it that I am not disturbed unless absolutely necessary?
I've got the key to this industry, and he won't listen to me.
Steve, just leave
Mr. Wilbanks alone today.
Mr. Crampton's coming in from New York, and he's nervous as a kitten.
Wait a minute.
Crampton's coming in tomorrow?
That's perfect. Uh, look,
I won't be able to see you tonight.
I've got some homework
I want to do.
The programs of this station...
Okay, 12:30 to 1:00, channel 18.
Okay, that does it.
You can go to bed now.
You've had a hard day's work.
And if this doesn't convince them,
I don't know what will.
"Dear Mr. Crampton.
As a loyal member of the United
Broadcasting Corporation,
I must tell you that I seem to have a strange ability which enables me to pick the shows the American people like best."
Hey, Mertons, the old limo's looking pretty slick.
It better.
I have to pick up the big man.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Hey, listen.
Would you mind slipping this to Crampton?
Uh, no, I can't do that.
If the boss caught me passing your notes to the chief...
Don't worry. I got something big.
It's our chance to put the network on top. I can prove it to Crampton.
Our network on top?
Forget it.
Guess I was mistaken.
You're another one of those.
Wait a minute.
Another one of those what?
One of those who has something against young people.
I never said that.
What's wrong with a young man getting ahead, anyway?
I mean, didn't William Pitt become prime minister of England at 24?
What about Alexander Hamilton?
He signed the Declaration of Independence at 19.
Alexander the Great. How old was he when he conquered Macedonia?
- I forget.
- And Louis XIV.
The greatest ruler France had. You know, he became king at the age of four.
Four?
There was even a British king who took over when he was nine months old.
I can go through history and show people that became great leaders at early ages.
Huh. Yeah, but what's that got to do with...
Here he comes. I know you'll find the time to slip it to Mr. Crampton.
- Morning, Mr. Wilbanks.
- Morning.
- Have a nice trip.
- Have a nice trip?
I'm only going to the airport.
Well, have a nice trip to the airport.
Something must be wrong, Wilbanks.
We're always third in the ratings.
Which would be all right, but there are only three networks!
We come up with loser after loser, disaster after disaster.
But chief, I've been through
47 pilot films this year...
Well, maybe it's your staff.
Have you got experienced people?
Well, experience is hard to come by, chief.
All you've got available to you are young kids, running around, trying to tell you how to run your business.
Speaking of kids telling you how to run your business, this is for you, Mr. Crampton.
Is that from Steven Post?
Why would you bother the chief with that?
Isn't it bad enough that I'm bothered by him?
He says he's got a foolproof method of determining the top-rated programs.
Hmm. He's ambitious.
He's rated all of last night's shows.
"Check with the overnight ratings.
You'll see I'm right."
Don't pay any attention to that kid.
He'll drive you nuts. He's 21 years old, and thinks he should run the network.
Well, I don't think age has anything to do with it, boss.
- I didn't ask you!
- What's wrong with a young man running the network?
Look at William Pitt.
He was only 24, and he was president of England.
And Alexander the Great. How old was he when he conquered Macedonia?
How would I know?
Just drive the car.
Look at all them little kids that was kings of different countries.
Like this little kid that was only four years old, and he was king of France.
And there's one kid, he was the king of England, he was only nine months!
Nine months? A person became king of England at nine months?
I don't remember anything about that.
You don't?
- Tell him to drive the car.
- Drive the car.
You rated every show exactly like our rating service.
How'd you do that, young man?
I guess I just have an instinct for what people like.
He's got an instinct for getting people in trouble.
Just a minute.
- You can't listen to punks.
- Francis.
Francis!
I'm out here to replace some shows that...
Well, they're not doing too well.
How would you like to look at some new films with me?
- I'd be honored.
- That's carrying it too far.
I think I could do a lot better if I took them home.
My powers of concentration are stronger that way.
Never mind.
No film leaves this studio.
That's company policy.
He's right.
Just be in our viewing room at 6:00.
Francis, we'll see how good the boy really is.
That looks good.
It's encouraging.
Yeah, I think we're on the right track.
- What was that?
- What?
What was that?
One of our plumbers, sir.
He's a terrific little guy. Really.
Shortest plumber I've ever seen.
I hope you're paying minimum.
- I don't hire the plumbers.
- You coming?
- I'll be right up.
- Find out who hires plumbers.
Stan, don't use the mail elevator for a couple of minutes.
- I got some important stuff on it.
- Sure, Steve.
Jen! Uh, hi.
What have you been up to?
I've been looking for you all day.
Oh, kind of in and out.
You know how it is. What's up?
Well, I wanted to talk to you.
I'm worried about my chimp.
He's calmed down like you said, but maybe too much.
- Uh, uh, what do you mean?
- He doesn't seem to be himself.
He has no energy, no spunk, nothing.
He's even stopped watching TV.
He probably got a hold of bad bananas or something.
Bananas?
Would they bother a chimp?
Uh, sure. If he got a hold of some bad ones, they would.
Hmm.
Steve, what's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.
Uh, I gotta go to that screening.
You know, big shots and everything.
It's already started.
What are you standing here for?
Uh, I was just waiting for some mail to come up.
Then you have to push the button.
Yeah. I was just thinking about doing that.
What is the matter with you?
You act like you're trying to get rid of me.
Oh, Jen, you know
I'd never do a thing like that.
If you want a ride home, you better come on.
Okay.
You know, Steve, sometimes you act really weird.
I'll see you later, Jen.
Is that you, Post?
Uh, yes, sir. Sorry I'm late.
Yes. Well, we're showing a few scenes from The Happy Harringtons first.
We're confident it's our strongest replacement show.
But feel free to have your own opinion.
Thank you, sir.
- What was that?
- I didn't say anything.
I get asthma every once in a while.
You better have that checked.
That's the worst I've heard.
Post, if you don't like the show, just say so!
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I, uh, I think I'll get my asthma spray.
I keep it in the projection booth.
Why would he keep his asthma spray in the projection booth?
- Well, he... I don't know.
- Oh, you don't know.
Can you ever answer anything but "I don't know"?
- Stevie.
- Hi, Tom.
What do you got, a replacement for Wilbanks?
No, he's a pet.
I'm watching him for a friend.
Hey, he's really great.
I gotta go back.
How about him watching from here?
- He won't be any problem.
- Sure.
I'm glad to have someone to talk to.
It gets lonely in here by yourself.
Now, don't let me down.
Thanks a lot, Tom.
Sure, Steve.
UBC proudly presents...
...Devil Dan!
Dumb kid. I told him to save this for the last, chief.
I'm sorry about this. Save it!
I know it isn't much, but we have to look at them all.
Don't save it!
Devil Dan?
Audience appeal?
- You've gotta be kidding.
- Not at all.
Devil Dan would start this network to the top.
Yes, well, my boy,
I think we at the network have our fingers on the pulse of the public, and it reads
Happy Harringtons to us.
But sir, people just won't buy that stuff anymore. That show is a dog.
Well, yes, we do appreciate your suggestion.
If we ever need you again, we'll be sure and get in touch.
- Ruthless, bald audacity.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
That boy is blind to everything human...
Figure a way to quietly get rid of him.
Oh, I can handle that.
I'm going east, I'll take care of things there. Get hold of publicity.
The Happy Harringtons are replacing Riot Squadron Saturday.
Tell them we want a big splurge on it.
Right, chief. I'll take care of it on this end. Right.
They just won't listen.
Nobody will listen.
They were nice enough to ask you to see the film.
You gave them your opinion, they didn't like it.
- You can't blame them.
- But they're wrong, Jen.
Well, how do you know they're wrong?
I just know it. I really know it!
And I know of a way to make them listen too.
Can I have your attention?
Your attention.
Thank you. I want you all to make yourselves comfortable, and I want you to enjoy yourselves.
But I would suggest that you hold your applause until after the show.
That way you won't miss any of the jokes.
Ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned for UBC's hilarious new show,
The Happy Harringtons!
UBC proudly presents...
...Devil Dan!
- Devil Dan?
- How did that happen?
What's going on here? In all my years,
I've never seen this happen.
It's those boobs in the transmitting room.
I'll get to the bottom of this if I have to fire every one.
Get me a phone.
There's no sense in calling anyone.
You see, I changed the program.
You?
Yes, sir. I know it may seem a little upsetting right now, but believe me, it's in the best interest of the company.
Do you realize that you have altered the will of a network?
And I, uh, I suppose you want me to resign?
No. You're fired.
Mr. Wilbanks,
New York on the phone.
That's Crampton!
What am I going to tell Crampton?
- Steve.
- Hey, look, Jen, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay, really.
Big dummy.
You see?
That's what happens when you have a Moonrise Night School man in the network business.
Why don't you shut up?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you going?
- I guess I'll get a hamburger.
Well, I'm kinda hungry too.
Look, Jen, maybe you'd better go back inside.
I mean, uh,
I'm not really the most popular guy in the world right now.
- You really want a hamburger?
- Uh-huh.
You look kinda funny riding back there.
Who said I was afraid of looking funny?
Holy mackerel!
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Wilbanks!
Oh, Mr. Wilbanks!
Say, that was really something.
A real touch of genius.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Hey, that was terrific.
How'd you come up with something like that? Congratulations.
I beg your pardon?
Very clever, Wilbanks.
Congratulations.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Just a minute.
- Can you tell me what all...
- Mr. Wilbanks, New York.
- Oh. Hello?
What time do you get to work? I've spent half the day trying to reach you.
Oh, you see, there's a three hour time difference, and where it's 12:00 noon in New York, out here it's only...
Don't tell me what time it is in New York. Get him!
- Who?
- Who?
Haven't you read the trade papers yet?
Trade papers? Uh...
- Wilbanks?
- Oh, no! How...
- Wilbanks, are you there?
- Uh, yes, I'm... I'm here.
Well, listen, sign him to a contract.
We don't want anyone stealing him from us.
But, uh, chief, I fired him.
- You what?
- Well, don't you remember?
I told you on the phone, and you told me...
Don't tell me what I told you.
I know what I told you.
Just get that boy back.
He's a genius!
Uh, I'll certainly do my best, chief, but I don't know whether...
Of course you don't know whether.
I'll be out tomorrow.
Have that boy in your office at 1:00.
And have the press there.
From now on,
I'll manage this myself!
On behalf of the board of directors of this network,
I take great pleasure in the following announcement.
Steven Post has been made our new program director.
- A boy that age, program director?
- What's the matter with a boy that age?
Look at William Pitt.
He was prime minister of England when he was only 24.
And Alexander the Great? How old was he when he conquered Macedonia?
No, we here at the network are convinced that Steven Post is a young man of unique talent, well-qualified to join the executive team that will lead UBC to the very top.
If the kid's going to be program director, what's going to happen to Wilbanks?
Oh, we haven't forgotten
Mr. Wilbanks. He's moved on too.
He'll be vice president in charge of cultural relations.
- What's that?
- We'll let Wilbanks explain.
- What is it, Mr. Wilbanks?
- That's very...
You see, whenever we have the...
Uh, I don't know what it is.
Steve, it's so wonderful.
Huh? Yeah.
Yeah, well, uh...
Mr. Crampton thought
I ought to have a place where I can kinda, oh, entertain and stuff.
On account of my new job, you know?
Oh, Steve,
I'm so happy for you.
You should be so proud of yourself.
And just think, you did it all on your own.
Yeah.
Hey!
Come on, sweetheart.
Thattaboy. Come on, baby.
Thattaboy. There you go.
Yeah, I love you too.
Watch the movie.
How about this one, Post?
- I don't know yet.
- He doesn't know yet.
No, he wants to run it.
- It's good.
- Oh, another winner.
Yeah, yeah, he likes it.
Yeah.
Congratulations, Steve.
Uh, on what?
On the award you're gonna win tonight.
Hey, look, Jen,
I haven't won that yet.
Well, you will. If you're not TV man of the year, who is?
Uh, Jen...
When are you gonna tell me about those locks?
There? Uh...
I can't.
Well, you see, it's kinda like my war room.
It's where I make all my decisions.
It's, uh...
It's very private.
Well, do I ever get to see?
Yeah, I'll show you sometime.
- Steve, what's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Uh, I was just thinking.
- About what?
Ah, it's a lot of stuff you wouldn't understand.
I might.
Well, I was thinking about people.
People like Vasco da Gama.
- Like who?
- Yeah, he was a discoverer.
- He discovered the West Indies.
- I know, but...
Isn't it just as good to discover something as invent it?
- I guess.
- Where would we be if people didn't discover things?
Just like some great scientist who...
Well, maybe he's not so great, but he discovers a lab assistant who's doing all the work.
But the scientist takes all the credit. Why?
Because he discovered him.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that, is there?
No, I guess not.
Good. That's the way
I had it figured.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the most coveted prize of all:
TV's "Man of the Year" award.
And the winner is...
...Steven Post,
- Yeah! Yeah!
President of the
United Broadcasting Corporation.
President?
Vice president.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
I mean, vice president.
But at any rate,
Steven Post is television's man of the year!
And now the key.
Congratulations, Crampton.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You have a fine young man.
Thank you, Clifford.
We're proud of him.
You should be. Your sponsors seem to like him. Gave him a nice little car.
Yes, he's a man who's going right to the top.
The very top, indeed.
Francis.
Excuse us, girls.
We gotta do something about that boy.
We've built a Frankenstein.
- We have. He's already got my job.
- But now it's getting serious.
- Now it's getting serious?
- How does the boy do it?
I don't know how.
I just know he's not smart enough to do it on his own.
- What have you done about it?
- What should I do?
- I'm in cultural relations.
- The basics, man. The basics.
Have you searched his office, grilled his secretary, tapped his phone, had him followed?
No. Wouldn't that be unethical?
Unethical?
Get with it, Wilbanks.
It's a desperate situation.
It requires desperate means.
Find out how that boy is doing it!
Hasta la vista,
Senor Post.
Hasta, hasta.
Hello in there.
Can you hear me?
Are you a prisoner?
Knock twice if you can hear me.
Thank heaven.
I'm a friend.
I beg your pardon?
He sounds gagged!
That dirty, ruthless...
Hey, I'm back!
Oh!
Okay, okay!
Okay! Don't go wild!
Hey, take it easy.
Wait a minute. Not the ballet.
That'll wreck your taste for sure.
You're supposed to pick the top-rated shows.
You got that finger of yours on the heartbeat of America.
Don't louse it up!
I'll put on some coffee, then we'll take a look at those new pilots.
You want some pizza tonight? I got two kinds.
Plain and with pepperoni.
You want the pepperoni?
Okay, you get the plain one.
Okay, it's ready!
All right. Showtime.
Now, one of these days, I'm gonna show you how to thread this thing.
I keep forgetting that.
It'd sure be great if you could pick another Devil Dan.
Who was in the room?
That's what I wanna know.
Well, first of all, there were three television sets in front of three chairs.
- Three sets?
- Yeah, and a projector and a screen.
Then there was this tree with a whole bunch of bananas on it.
Bananas? Ba...
That could be it.
- Bananas could be brain food.
- Oh, yeah. They are.
Jen, get me Dr. Schmidt in Research on the phone.
- I'm sure he's gone home.
- I know he's gone home.
Get him on the phone.
He's probably got...
- What is it, Roger?
- It's not bananas.
It's that phantom roommate he keeps locked up.
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't see him.
They were talking, but I couldn't see him.
Well, let's get down to basics.
Tell me what you did see, and don't tell me about the thing around your leg again.
It was weird.
Whoever it was was wearing a little red cap with a blue bon-bon on the top.
- It was just gliding along.
- Hello? Hello?
There were empty banana skins everywhere.
And then, this hairy arm grabbed me right in the closet.
It was hideous. There was no head, no body, no feet.
- Hello?
- Just a hairy arm.
Jen, what are you doing?
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Schmidt, Francis Wilbanks.
Uh, tell me, doctor, are bananas brain food?
Bananas? Brain food?
Well, I couldn't say for sure, but I do recall a certain tribe in New
Guinea who subscribed to the theory that bananas were indeed, a brain food.
- Oh, hi, Jen.
- Hello, Vasco da Gama.
- What?
- Oh, you know.
He was the one who discovered the West Indies.
He was a discoverer. Discoverers are just as important as inventors.
Like the mad scientist who keeps his assistant locked in the basement.
I didn't say anything about a scientist.
- I want my chimp.
- What?
I know, Steve.
They never listened to me, Jen.
They wouldn't have for a million years!
Steve, open this door.
I didn't even have a car.
I had a motorcycle.
Now I got a DeTomaso Mangusta.
A brand-new DeTomaso Mangusta.
I mean it, Steve.
Now, you open that door!
Uh... Look, Jen.
I did it for you.
I mean, why would you ever want to marry a mail boy?
I kidded myself, but that's all I knew I'd ever be.
You never said you wanted to marry me.
Well, uh...
That's because I was a mail boy.
I mean, uh,
I didn't even have a car.
Just a motorcycle.
I told you before, there's nothing the matter with a motorcycle.
Uh, I guess he recognized your voice.
I'm kinda glad you... you found out. I...
I was trying to figure out a way to tell you.
You see, Jen, it is working.
He is happy.
Look, we could have it all.
I'm not hurting anybody, either.
I guess you've been treating him pretty good.
Why don't, um...
Why don't we just keep it in the family?
Okay, he can stay.
But remember,
I get visitation rights.
Yeah.
Hey, Steve.
Hey, you're looking really sharp.
- New job.
- Yeah.
What happened to that chimp you used to bring around?
Not so loud. Not around here.
Yeah? I mean, he sure liked Devil Dan, didn't he?
I mean, I've never seen anything like it. He just...
The manager said room 1123 is directly across from Post's apartment.
- Now we'll see.
- Oh, see what?
I can understand your skepticism, Uncle.
This has been a gigantic puzzle, but I put the pieces together, and they all fit.
Oh, fit, my foot.
This is ridiculous.
I didn't believe a mail boy could do it.
I'm not gonna believe a chimp can do it.
- It's a wild goose chase.
- You mean, wild monkey chase.
It's not funny.
- Stop that simple laughing.
- Sorry, boss.
I don't like this.
I don't like it at all.
There must be something criminal.
Oh, Uncle, we're not doing anything criminal.
Then why do I feel like a peeping Tom?
Okay. Look.
Well, so what? It's just that mail boy sitting there all by himself, looking at TV.
Look. Quick, quick! Look.
Good heavens.
I think we finally may be getting somewhere.
Here! See what I mean?
See what I...
Yes, I do.
He's watching Smuggler's Gold.
That's the number one-rated show.
That's what I've been trying to tell you. The chimp is picking the shows.
Well, we can't really tell. He might not even know what he's looking at.
Oh, a commercial break.
Wilbanks, he knows!
He really knows. He got a beer during the commercial.
Proof positive.
Oh, that's a sure sign if I've ever seen one.
Wilbanks, get that chimp.
- What are we doing here?
- Just follow me.
I didn't get where I am without planning ahead. Come on.
Hey, boss, don't ya think it'd be better if I stayed here
- and cut people off at the pass?
- Cut them off at the pass?
You don't want people bothering you out on the ledge.
Will you stop that silly talk and come on?
But, boss, I...
I get sick when I look down.
Well, then look up.
I have the same problem when I look up.
Get prepared to be sick.
I can't handle that chimp by myself.
But, boss...
Will you stop that simple wheezing?
I can't help it. This always happens to me at high altitudes.
You're only 200 feet up.
Let go of me.
Ohhhhh!
I told you to stay with me.
A- ha! Hello, little fella.
Let's go for a walk, huh?
That's a good fella.
That's the worst experience
I ever had.
Yeah. The door, the door. Come on.
Boss, the door is locked.
Uh... Well, of course it's locked.
You don't expect him to leave it open with a valuable chimp like that in here, do you?
We're not going out there again, are we?
Why not? The chimp isn't afraid.
He's used to swinging around in high places.
Come on!
Oh, no! Now you did it with that wheezing.
- You scared the chimp.
- Sorry, boss.
Sorry doesn't feed the bulldog.
Where'd he go?
- There he is.
- Where?
Boss, help!
Stop wheezing!
What are you doing?
Wait! Ow!
Help! Oh!
Not the tie, not the tie!
Ah! Get the...
Oh, get the... Oh! Oh.
Oh, just watch it. Oh.
Now, don't touch me.
Just don't touch me.
Yes, boss.
I can't understand what happened to your car.
I guess they had to gas it up or something.
- That's okay. I'm in no hurry.
- I better check.
How did you get down here?
Oh, no.
What do we do now?
Now don't panic.
We'll just crawl back in the kid's room.
He's bound to have a phone and we'll call somebody and have them get us.
Oh, I left that darn window open too far.
No more open window for you.
I'll see you later.
How'd he get back in there?
How would I know?
This is locked too.
What do we do?
Well, maybe he can unlock it.
He seems able to do everything else.
For the last time, will you stop that wheezing?
Little fella?
Turn the handle.
You're gonna love it.
That's it. Yes.
There you go. Yes. Yes.
- You're not gonna start that?
- I can't help it, boss.
We don't have to stand up again?
Of course we have to stand up!
Get up! Get up!
Maybe we can attract some attention, help get off of this thing.
Boss, this is awful.
Stop hiccupping! First you wheeze and then you hiccup!
I can't help it.
I hiccup when I get nervous.
Stop it! I can't stand it!
Don't you understand that?
- Just try holding your breath.
- That never works with me.
Maybe if you get me a glass of water. That sometimes helps.
All right. I'll get...
How can I get you a glass of water?
I can't...
Come on! Glass of water.
It's an ambulance, police cars.
Well, you wanted to attract attention.
Oh, here we go again.
K-7, this is 10-Sugar-Charlie.
Come in.
We're here. The report checks out.
We got a couple of nuts trying to commit suicide.
Give me that thing.
All right, now, just... just take it easy up there.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Above all, don't jump.
He thinks we're gonna jump.
No, we're not going to jump!
Hey, boss,
I'm losing my buttons.
We almost lost one that time.
This is gonna be a tough one, Vince.
Here, take this outta the way.
Take it over to the truck.
Bring them in.
Bring them on in.
Hey, the fire engines are stopping here.
Do you smell smoke?
No, I don't smell smoke.
The building isn't on fire.
Stop the wheezing, will you?
Please stop! First you wheeze, then hiccup, then wheeze again!
You're enough to drive anybody nuts!
- Oh, I am, am I?
- Yes!
Well, you're my boss.
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but you've been complaining ever since we've been up here.
If you don't like the way
I wheeze and hiccup, why don't you go find your own ledge to stand on?
What?
Maybe they're coming to rescue us.
They're not coming to rescue us.
That's our news helicopter.
Our own network is taking pictures of us?
That's exactly what I mean.
We interrupt to bring you a newscast of a suicide try on Wilshire Boulevard in Los ¡ngeles.
Oh, isn't it sad how many nuts are running around loose today?
It certainly is, sweetheart.
Our special UBC helicopter enables us to bring you an exclusive close-up view of the pair attempting suicide.
These pictures, live from the scene.
There you are.
Another first for UBC.
Oh, no!
Oh, now I've had experience of this type of thing before.
Anything can make them panicky and jump.
May I have the mike, please?
Now, gentlemen, remain calm.
No problem can't be solved.
Will you listen to me, gentlemen, now? I repeat:
There is no problem that cannot be solved.
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.
Sounds like some kind of a foreign language.
Now, it must be very cold up there.
Why don't you go in and get some coffee?
It's Father O'Leary from St. Timothy's.
What's he doing here?
He probably came over to talk us out of suicide.
He can talk me out of it real easy.
Now hang on, men.
- Hang on for one more minute.
- The life net's ready now.
Oh, good. Very good.
Come with me, Vince.
Oh, I'm ruined. I'm ruined!
What's Crampton gonna say?
You lame brain.
You thick-skulled, pin-headed, dim-witted bumbler!
- Hey, boss, look. A net.
- Huh?
You don't suppose they expect us to jump?
No, that's probably just there for safety.
If Father O'Leary gets up here,
I'm gonna have him sneak me out the back way.
I helped him with his bazaar last year.
Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Stop right where you are. Don't move!
- Father O'Leary!
- Where?
I wanted to go out the back way!
Over that way!
That's it.
Ease it over here.
Why would he try to commit suicide?
Get the chimp!
Get the chimp! It's not bananas!
It's not bananas, it's the chimp!
He picks the shows, believe me.
He knows. It's the chimp.
Bananas don't have anything to do with it. Get the chimp.
It's the chimp.
He's the one. Help! Help!
There was a chimp, came down the building before they discovered those guys up there.
It belonged to Steven Post.
Steven Post?
The TV wonder boy?
- There's the other one.
- This one was out with him.
What were you doing up there?
I was walking along on the tenth floor and I seen this nut out on the ledge.
So I went out there to try to talk him out of jumping.
- Then this window got stuck...
- Wait a minute.
You didn't happen to see him.
You work for Wilbanks.
- Everyone knows that. Come on.
- Talk him out of jumping?
Please, what are you talking about?
All right!
Hold it! Hold it!
Look. We're gonna arrive at the truth of this thing, so you might as well tell us now.
Well, my boss wanted me to help him get this kid's chimp.
The chimp belongs to Steven Post?
What'd he want him for?
Come on! Out with it!
Well, it sounds kinda crazy but, my boss thinks the chimp can pick the best TV shows.
Pretty funny, huh?
- Excuse me!
- Yeah, what?
This story about a chimp selecting our TV shows.
- What about it?
- Well, do you believe it?
Of course, I believe it.
I knew it all the time.
Uh, madam?
What do you think of the rumor of a chimp selecting our TV shows?
A chimp picking TV shows?
Ridiculous.
Well, you know how those rumors get started.
- I know I...
- Wait a minute!
Those stations have been switching and canceling my favorite shows for years.
Maybe a chimp is behind this mess.
- Oh, no.
- It's a plot.
- You're all in on it.
- We have nothing...
I am so sick and tired of liking a show and having it pulled off the air or put in another time.
- Madam...
- It drives you crazy.
I'm getting to the point, I'd like to take the TV and throw it out the window.
The last show I liked, they took off the air.
The minute I got to like it, off the air. How do I know what happened?
I don't know what happened to John.
Has the man from the Justice
Department arrived yet?
- Everybody's here, sir.
- Good.
That's good.
Gentlemen, television has had problems before.
We can work this one out if we keep cool heads!
"Keep cool heads."
Your Wilbanks says you've got a monkey picking programs, and you want us to "keep cool heads."
- I was delirious.
- Don't give us that!
For ten years you've been the third-rated network.
Suddenly, you jump to number one.
Now, there has to be a reason.
You don't have the personnel to do that.
Just a minute.
I've plenty of personnel.
- I have...
- Oh, shut up.
Mr. Crampton.
We've had a tacit understanding to share technological advances.
It seems to me that you've betrayed that understanding.
- We have not.
- Just a minute.
I must speak for the Justice Department.
We can have no understandings between networks,
- tacit or otherwise.
- Oh, come on, Harry.
How can the Department call a little chimpanzee a tech...
- So there's a chimp.
- Then there is a chimp?
Gentlemen, please.
Admittedly, there is a chimp.
And he does like TV.
And it seems he does prefer the top-rated shows.
And he does go to the refrigerator and get a beer during the commercials.
Gentlemen!
If the American people ever found out that a chimpanzee was selecting programs, it would be the end of TV.
Gentlemen.
I have a simple solution to the whole problem.
- Yes?
- We must destroy the chimp.
Oh, no, no.
I can't see it at all.
- We can't do that.
- Oh, no. We couldn't...
Why, we'd have those societies for the prevention of things all over our backs.
That would be the end of our dog food accounts.
- I think I have an idea.
- I hope it's better than the bananas.
It's practical and humane.
You see, a chimp belongs in a jungle, not in a network office.
We know that, Dr. Schmidt.
That's the problem.
What we do is buy the chimp, return him to the jungle.
He'll be happy, the networks will continue on as usual and we will be rid of
Steven Post once and for all!
Brilliant, Schmidt, brilliant.
Bravo! Beautiful!
That's the one.
We certainly have the money.
And every man has his price.
So that's what they think, huh?
Every man's got his price.
Well, don't worry. I don't.
Steve, why don't we take him and blow this place?
Forget this whole rat race.
I don't want them to put him in a jungle.
Jen, they can't get to me.
I can't be bought.
Right.
$500,000. That's a...
That's a lot of money.
Well, of course it's a lot of money.
How can you even hesitate?
- Well, I don't know...
- Your future is on the line.
Now you listen to this.
You turn us down, you'll never work again.
Come on. Be smart, boy.
- I, uh... I have a problem.
- A problem?
Yes, sir. You see, someone else is involved and I...
Son, no more bickering.
All right.
This will be our final offer.
Take it or leave it.
One million dollars.
One million dollars.
You did it.
- You took the money.
- One million dollars, Jen.
You know what they're going to do with him.
It was take it or leave it.
Besides, maybe a chimp does belong in the jungle.
- Not that one.
- Jen.
We can get married now.
We've got everything.
I thought we did for a while.
Now we have nothing.
I don't even think
I like you very much anymore.
Boss. What I don't understand is why do you have to go?
Well, it's just too important a mission to trust to, uh, underlings.
Yeah, but all the other networks are here.
Oh, I get it.
You don't trust each other.
Well, of course we trust each other.
Where would you get a ridiculous idea like that?
It's just that we're getting together to have a little, uh, outing.
Yes. And you're in charge while we're gone.
Me in charge?
You're kidding?
We've never been more serious!
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Absolutely nothing. If anyone asks a question, you don't know the answer.
Anyone wants a decision, stall.
Don't do anything at all!
Do you think you can handle that?
Yeah.
Now what?
Uh, Mr. Wilbanks, can I talk to you for a minute?
- About what?
- Well, uh...
You see, I was wondering if maybe you'd reconsider.
I give you the million dollars back, you give me the chimp?
Well, certainly not, Post.
Are you crazy? A deal is a deal.
- That's all there is to it!
- Of all the nerve!
All set, Uncle.
Mertons is in charge till we get back. Help him all you can.
Mertons is in charge?
Now, open the door, Roger.
Gee, I'm sorry, Steve.
But I guess you can't have everything.
Boy, I'd sure do it different if I had another chance.
Boy, you gentlemen sure picked an isolated spot.
I don't think this place has ever been explored.
Well, uh, don't worry, about the chimp.
He's used to fending for himself.
Okay, if you'll clear this area,
I'm gonna open this and there's gonna be suction. I don't want to lose you.
Right. We'll watch it from back there.
Okay, uh, take it easy back there, huh, gentlemen?
And by all means, uh, don't touch any of those levers.
Don't worry about that chute. It's guaranteed to open in ten seconds.
Oh! Don't touch that lever. Oh.
That's a no-no. Ooh.
Don't do that. No, no, no.
- Are you comfortable, chief?
- Just fine.
As soon as the chimp is out, we'll have lunch.
- Oh, that'll be nice.
- All right.
Here we go. Open up.
Out we go. Jump. Jump.
When you throw him out, be sure you throw him far enough so he's in the pictures!
Here we go. Out we go. No?
- Will you throw him out?
- I don't think he wants to go.
I don't think he wants to go.
Put your foot out. Here we go.
- Get rid of him!
- Foot up. Come on. Get out.
Oh, Mr. Crampton!
Oh, Mr. Crampton!
I think I can explain this, guys.
We were cruising up there at 2,000 feet, and the wind...
Hello? Oh, Steve!
Yeah. Yeah. I...
I seem to be calling for a friend of yours.
Say, uh, this is gonna be hard to believe but you remember that chance you were talking about?
Well, ya got it!
Yeah!
It was that simple. I gave Mertons the million, and he gave me the chimp.
It must have been tough to give up all that money.
Mertons needed it to finance a force to find Wilbanks and the rest of them.
You know, when you think about it, it wasn't even my money.
It was yours. He's your chimp.
You mean, I gave up a million bucks?
Yep.
You know what, Steve? I don't even think we're gonna miss it.
And now an exclusive.
Steven Post, television's man of the year, resigned his position today as vice president of UBC, and took as his bride,
Miss Jennifer Scott, his private secretary and childhood sweetheart.
Their honeymoon destination is unknown, but wherever they go, their many friends wish this storybook couple the storybook ending:
That they live happily ever after.
The doubt while the jury is out
Or the thrill when they're reading the will
Or the chase for the man with the face
That's entertainment
The dame who is known as the flame
Of the king of an underworld ring
He's an ape who won't let her escape
That's entertainment
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene where a ghost and a prince meet
And everyone ends in mincemeat
The gag may be waving that flag
That began with a Mr. Cohan
Hip hooray the American way
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
That's entertainment
Here we are!
All right.
That's entertainment
Look what I can do!
It's still me!
It's still me!
And now, as we carry right on
We call upon charming Leslie Caron
Anywhere you can watch Fred Astaire
That's entertainment
A scene played by Judy and Gene
It's a song that goes ringing along
Garbo's dance has a touch of romance
That's entertainment
"The show must go on" is the show business cry
But there's always someone who wants to know why
With Robert Taylor
I'll try to come up with an answer
It's Eleanor Powell the dancer
More
There is much more in store
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
The bells are ringing
For me and my gal
For Me and My Gal was my first film... and, boy, was I lucky.
I co-starred with Judy Garland.
That's what I call starting at the top.
Knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
They've been sewing something old and something new
Sew something that is blue so they can make a trousseau for my gal
They're congregating for me and my gal
Look here!
Why, that's the parson waiting for me and my gal
And sometime
We're going to build a little home
For two
- Or three
- Or four
- Or five
- Or maybe more
Loveland for me and my gal
Fascinating rhythm, you got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm, I'm all a-quiver
Fred, I hear tap-dancing is popular again.
And here's a lady who will keep it that way. ;
Eleanor Powell.
Each morning I'm waking up
Very happy just to find that no work has been done
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
A couple of weeks
Somewhere far away off
But make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the man that I used to be
Oh, fascinating rhythm
Won't you stop picking on me?
I've got a feeling you're fooling
I've got a notion it's make-believe and you are laughing right up your sleeve
Mr. Kelly, would you tell me a couple of things... you never expected to see?
Well, Mr. Astaire, I never expected to see
Robert Taylor singing.
Moments of paradise
You're such a standout but how you hand out that
I've got a feeling you're fooling
I've got a feeling it's all a frame
It's just a well-known old army game
No fooling
- No fooling
- No fooling
No fooling
When I'm
When I'm fooling with you
And I certainly never expected to see
Greta Garbo dancing.
Fred, I hear that since you've been a kid... you always said you wanted to be a dancing man.
No, Gene. That's not true.
I never said anything like that in my life.
I wanna be a dancing man
While I can
Gonna leave my footsteps
On the sands of time
If I never leave a dime
A dancing man
With footsteps on the sands
Of rhythm
And rhyme
A dancing man
With footsteps on the sands
Of rhythm
A song of love is a sad song
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
One of my happiest discoveries was Leslie Caron.
After An American in Paris, she starred in Lili.
A song of love is a sad song
For I have loved, and it's so
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili
Hi-Lo
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
I always wanted to play a clown... and in The Pirate,
I finally got the chance... with Judy, and a terrific Cole Porter song.
Dress in huge baggy pants
And you'll ride the road to romance
A butcher or a baker ladies never embrace
A barber for a beau would be a social disgrace
They all will come to call if you can fall on your face
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown!
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Be the poor silly ass
And you'll always travel first class
The Brothers Marx hit our screens
With their zany routines
Groucho, brash and absurd
Harpo never uttered a word
Chico's quaint piano style
Had his audience in the aisle
They could have played French comedy, très, très élégant
Or scenes in English drawing rooms with riches to flaunt
But they knew they'd get far more laughs with Margaret Dumont
Be a
Chico!
Harpo!
Groucho!
- Wait a minute. This can't be my room.
- Yes, sir.
Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight? That's an awful big number for a birdcage this size.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you just put the stateroom in the trunk?
Sing ho!
For the open highway
Sing ho!
For the open road
- Hello, boss. What are you doing here?
- Hello.
This makes it a perfect voyage.
- I'm sorry. I thought this was my trunk.
- It is your trunk.
I don't remember packing you boys.
Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia.
He's sleeping it off.
That's as grisly a looking object as I've ever seen.
Get him up out of there.
- Yes?
- We've come to make up your room.
Come in, girls. Leave all hope behind.
Work fast because you gotta get out in 10 minutes.
Tomasso. Wake up.
They're going to fix the bed.
I'd like two pillows on that bed there.
There's a slight misunderstanding here.
I said the girls had to work fast, not your friend.
He's still asleep.
You know, he does better asleep than I do awake.
Yeah, he always sleeps that way.
- Now he's half-asleep.
- Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.
- All right, come on.
- Yes?
I'm the engineer.
I'm here to turn off the heat.
You can start right in on him.
Did you want a manicure?
No. Come on in.
I hadn't planned on a manicure, but on a journey like this... you ought to have every convenience you can get.
Did you want your nails long or short?
You better make them short.
It's getting kind of crowded in here.
I'm the engineer's assistant.
I had a premonition you were going to show up.
The engineer's over there in the corner.
You can chop your way right through.
Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?
I got plenty of room.
- Yes?
- Is my Aunt Minnie in here?
You can come in and prowl around if you want to.
If she isn't in here, you can probably find somebody just as good.
- Could I use your phone?
- Use the phone?
- I'll lay you even money you can't get in.
- How do you do?
This boat will be in New York before you get to that phone.
I came to mop up.
Just the woman I'm looking for.
Come right ahead.
You have to start on the ceiling.
It's the only place that's not occupied.
- You can clean my shoes if you want to.
- Operator.
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room, will you?
- Steward.
- Come right ahead.
- The food!
- We've been waiting all afternoon for you.
I want my Aunt Minnie!
From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be riding high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on
Kiss Me Kate with Cole Porter's lilting music... choreographed by Hermes Pan... and performed by Ann Miller and company.
That's Bob Fosse dancing with Carol Haney.
I wonder what ever happened to him.
I love the looks of you
The lure of you
I'd love to make a tour of you
The arms, the eyes the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you
Cyd Charisse, lovely Cyd Charisse.
How she dances.
This is from Silk Stockings.
I get too hungry for dinner at 8.;00
I like the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
Beautiful Lena Horne sings a great
Rodgers and Hart standard... from the film Words and Music.
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Don't dish the dirt
With the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, that's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Jerome Kern wrote some of the loveliest melodies I've ever heard.
And none lovelier than this one, sung by Kathryn Grayson... and danced by
Marge and Gower Champion.
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
I could hardly wait to keep our date
This lovely Easter morning
Someone once asked Jerome Kern... where in American music he would place Irving Berlin.
Mr. Kern replied,
"Irving Berlin is American music."
For
In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it
You'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade
I'll be all in clover and when they look us over
We'll be the proudest couple in the Easter parade
On the avenue
Fifth A venue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the guy I'm taking to the Easter parade
On the avenue
Fifth A venue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure
I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter parade
Anything that happens in life can happen on the screen
Fantasies appear
Colorful and queer
Watch me
You'll see just what I mean
First
Take the red from the scene
After that
Please remove all the green
Then the yellow and blue, make them disappear, too
What's left?
Black and white
But that's quite all right
It's entertainment
You came
I was alone
Here's Bing Crosby... starting us off in some numbers filmed in glorious black and white.
The siren he's singing to is Fifi D'Orsay.
The film is Going Hollywood.
Born to be kissed
I can't resist
You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart
Take it and say we'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you
Temptation
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Judy Garland told me that this is the song she sang... for her audition at MGM.
By the way, she got the job.
Zing! Went the strings of my heart!
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing! Went the strings of my heart!
The wonderful Ethel Waters in Cabin in the Sky.
And that's Rochester on guitar.
Here I go again
I'm hearing trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love
Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought the cards were a frame-up
And I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have our happy ending now
Taking a chance on love
Got to swing that jinx away
Swing a hi-de-hey
Hi-de-hey-de
Rap, tap on wood
Eleanor Powell in Born to Dance.
And she sure was.
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
The Army and Navy forever
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
Men, the ship we were waiting for is anchored in the river... but it's in the hands of the police.
Our plan's been discovered, and if we're ever to have our freedom... we've got to fight for it tonight.
Who's with me?
Not me.
All right, if I have to, I'll go alone.
- Wait, Charles. I'll go with you.
- One man at last.
And me, too.
Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald were the king and queen of operetta... and New Moon was one of their most popular.
Now we're 10! That makes an army.
Come on!
Give me some men
Who are stout-hearted men
Who will fight for the right they adore
Start me with ten
Who are stout-hearted men
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more
I'm going.
Shoulder to shoulder
And bolder and bolder
They grow as they go to the fore
Then there's nothing in the world
Can halt or mar a plan
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man
Charles, you can't fight the whole French fleet.
It's fight or perish for every man on this island.
- Charles.
- Goodbye, Marianne.
Forgive me for any grief
I've ever caused you.
Charles.
You'll come back, Charles.
You must come back to me.
This eager heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
Near or far, where ever you are
I'm coming back to you
Love will guide me
In the light that follows night
I'll see you smiling through
Your love
Will be beside me
The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while you're waiting there
This heart of mine is singing
I will come back
- To you
- To me
Oh, what a tune
One of my favorite comedians... also happens to be one of my favorite human beings... that lovable lunatic, Jimmy Durante.
It's got the whole world spooning
I'm walking down the street
I'm walking down the street
Tell me, Mr. James, now just what did you accomplish?
That note was given to me by Bing Crosby... and was he glad to get rid of it.
I got rhythm, I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
Now, Busby Berkeley's dude-ranch finale from Girl Crazy... with Judy, Mickey, and Tommy Dorsey.
Old Man Trouble,
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Take a pie in the face
And you'll wow the whole human race
In the beginning, there was slapstick comedy.
And Laurel and Hardy.
So you can't sleep?
Abbott and Costello being
Abbott and Costello.
I'm going to put this in your ears... and then when I go to sleep, you won't hear the record.
When I go to sleep, you take the arm off...
- and the record will stop, and I'll sleep.
- All right.
- Yes.
- Now how's that?
Everything all right?
How's that? All right?
Is that all right?
I said, is that all right?
- Is that all right, the stuff in your ears?
- Yes. Can't hear. Swell.
And when you go to sleep, I'll turn it off.
- Take it off. These are good.
- Go ahead and get your sleep.
I know I'll get some sleep.
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- What?
I says, I'm gonna get some sleep.
- That's what I'm here for.
- Then why do you keep saying...
- I can't hear you, please.
- Then keep them in your ears...
- you don't have to listen to nothing.
- What?
Look. Now listen.
Don't get excited, please. Will you?
With these in my ears, I can't hear.
Here. Try it yourself now. See that?
Now can you hear anything?
- What?
- Can you hear me?
You can't hear anything, can you?
How can I hear if you're gonna put these in my ears like that?
After all, I can't hear if you got them in my ears.
He's got them again.
In this 1929 film... among a group of songwriters, we find...
Well, he'll introduce himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce myself.
My name is Jack Benny, and I was asked... to be master of ceremonies for this occasion.
I'd like to identify these boys for you... so in case you find them prowling around your home some night... you'll know how to address them.
Mr. Nacio Herb Brown, the composer at the piano... and Mr. Arthur Freed, the lyricist... who also writes the words.
These two boys wrote...
Doll Dance, Broadway Melody...
You Were Meant For Me, the Pagan Love Song... and The Wedding of the Painted Doll.
It's a holiday
Today's the wedding of the painted doll
It's a jolly day
The news is spreading all around the hall
Red Riding Hood and Buster Brown
The Jumping Jack jumped into town
From far and near, they're coming here
Church bells ringing
Bringing all the little dollies
From the follies
With their painted cheeks
Little mama doll has fussed around for weeks and weeks
Shoo the blues, no time to lose
Bikes and shoes will spread the news
That it's a holiday
Today's the wedding of the little painted doll
I've come to the conclusion that it's a very simple matter to write a popular song.
Let's see how song writer Sammy Cahn feels about that.
Writing a song can be agony or ecstasy.
It can take half an hour or half a year.
But when anyone writes a song in a movie... there never seems to be any problem.
Inspiration turns on faster than a light bulb.
For instance... look how hard
Ann Sothern and Robert Young... have to struggle to write a song... which was written by
George and Ira Gershwin.
And lovely.
Hey, "Oh, sweet and lovely."
Oh, sweet and lovely, can it be true?
You are the one
Baby, be mine
Baby, be mine
Oh, sweet and lovely,
Baby, be mine
Baby, be good
Lady, be good
That's it, "Lady, be good."
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Yeah!
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
How's that?
I am so awfully misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me
...this feeling.
Lew Ayres, prodded by Al Shean... sets his love for Jeanette MacDonald to music.
You got something that hurts you, that's important, that means something.
Well, write it out. Put it in notes.
Orchestrate it.
Make the violins tell it, and the brasses.
You never lost Mary Hale.
You lost yourself.
You were like a bird that wouldn't fly, a fish that wouldn't swim... a musician that wouldn't write.
Speaking a woman's name night after night before you go to sleep... that's for nobodies, for weaklings.
But you, you got to sing out on them so she'll hear it... and no matter where she is, she'll hear her name in your music... and then she'll come back to you.
Although your tears may fall
Jimmy.
We won't be far apart
Summer journeys to Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town
We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
Now Mickey Rooney and Tom Drake show us... how Rodgers and Hart did it.
It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow to and fro
Fred Astaire and Red Skelton as Kalmar and Ruby.
I wouldn't write that song with you if you begged me.
Begged you? I didn't even ask you.
I guess you just can't help it, Harry.
I feel sorry for you.
Feel sorry for me?
You must think I'm just some...
I can tell you what I think of you in three little words.
You're a dope!
Three little words, "You're a dope."
You are a dope
In the film The Great Waltz...
Fernand Gravet as Johann Strauss... composedTales from the Vienna Woods... just by riding through the woods with Miliza Korjus.
Come on, my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie
That's entertainment
Good morning
Good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning
Good morning to you
When the band began to play
This is one of those terrific
Singin' in the Rain numbers... with Gene, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor having a ball.
So, good morning
Good morning
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning
Good morning to you and you and you and you
Good morning
Good morning
We've gabbed the whole night through
Good morning
Good morning to you
Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana
In the morning
In the morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning
Good morning to you
Might be just as iffy
If we was in Mississippi
When we left the movie show the future wasn't bright
But came the dawn the show goes on and I don't want to say good night
- So say good morning
- Good morning
Rainbows are shining through
Good morning
Good morning
Bonjour
Buenos Dias
Buongiorno
Guten Morgen
Good morning to you
Fred, Nanette Fabray, and Jack Buchanan... as a very young trio in this Schwartz and
Dietz number from Band Wagon.
Mrs. Wipple Poofer loves to talk to Mrs. Hildendorfer
Of the fatal natal day she had her silly Willy
Mrs. Hudson-Cooper loves to talk to Mrs. Golden-Wasser
Of her major operation when she had her twins
But when Mother comes along
She silences the others
She accomplished something that is very rare in mothers
MGM has got a Leo
But Mama has got a trio
She is proud but says three is a crowd
Oh, we do everything alike
We look alike
We dress alike, we walk alike
We talk alike, and what is more
We hate each other very much
We hate our folks
We're sick of jokes on what an art it is to tell us apart
We eat the same kind of vittles
We drink the same kind of bottles
We sit in the same kind of highchair highchair, highchair
I wish I had a gun
A real gun
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Fred, you remember those wonderful parties with Judy... where she'd get up and sing this song?
She first sang it to Margaret O'Brien in Meet Me in St. Louis.
Next year all our troubles will be miles away
Once again, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little
Christmas now
Stepping out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight
Here you are again, Fred, in Easter Parade.
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knocking wood
There'll be smooth sailing
'Cause I'm trimming my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes
And on my nails
Stepping out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight
What a fabulous bit of trick photography.
Please, Kelly. I don't tell your secrets.
Ten cents a dance
That's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Doris Day, belting out another great Rodgers and Hart tune... from Love Me or Leave Me.
Ten cents a dance
Dandies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown
7.;00 to midnight
I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes
Sometimes I think
I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy
Ten cents a dance
- I got
- Rhythm
- I got
- Music
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
I've always said,
"Just put Gene with a bunch of kids...
"and you're bound to come up with a winner. " Watch.
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Old man Trouble,
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
- Vous comprenez ca?
- Non!
- I got
- Rhythm
- I got
- Music
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Charlot!
Charlie Chaplin!
Aeroplane!
Who could ask for anything more?
More!
C'est tout!
Au revoir!
You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy
Then snap!
Those eyes, those sighs
They're part of the tender trap
After having sung with the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras...
Frank Sinatra made his solo debut... at the Paramount Theater in New York in December 1942.
They had to call out the police to control the crowds.
Especially his most avid fans, the bobbysoxers.
When he walked out on the stage... it was not merely the birth of a star... but the creation of a legend.
I'll walk alone
They'll ask me why
And I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
I'll walk alone
It was inevitable that the Sinatra hysteria would lead him to Hollywood... and equally inevitable... that producer Arthur Freed would choose him... to sing Kern and Hammerstein's classic. ;
OI' Man River.
OI'man river
That ol'man river
He must know somethin'
But he don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin'along
He don't plant taters
And he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em
Is soon forgotten
But ol'man river
Just keeps rollin'along
I fall in love too easily
There's something about a Sinatra ballad that makes it automatically unforgettable.
Here is young Blue Eyes singing one of my favorites from Anchors Aweigh.
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I believe
Frank sings to
Jimmy Durante and Billy Roy in. ;
It Happened in Brooklyn.
If you'll wish for the dream
By the wishing well
Don't tell the wish or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive
But that's what I believe
I don't care
High Society.
And it can't get much higher... than Frank serenading the future princess of Monaco.
'Cause you're sensational
Making love is quite an art
What you require is the proper squire to fire your heart
And if you'll say that one fine day
You'll let me come to call
We'll have a ball
'Cause you're sensational
Sensational
That's all
She argued
Fought like a wildcat
She threatened
Practically drew a gun on the boy
She said
"You can't send me home
- "Not like this"
- What happened?
She finally got her kiss
It seems only yesterday that I did this number with Frank.
That's when he taught me how to dance.
What a time we had tonight
What a dish, what a dream, what a dame
And she lives alone
I gets weary
And so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin'
But I'm feared of dyin'
And ol'man river
He just keeps rollin'
Along
Movie buffs and the rest
Have a line or scene they like best
The courtroom where a lawyer pleads for his client's life
A sleuth that's hot but cannot spot the gun or the knife
But you'll knock 'em flat with
"That's no lady, that was my wife"
They all last, unsurpassed
Here's the cast
Please let me stay.
But I want to be alone.
I just want to be alone.
We want to be alone.
But we want to be left alone.
Do you want to be alone, comrade?
No.
I don't know how you'll look tomorrow... but right now, you're the most beautiful dame in the world.
- You want to work with me?
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.
Shake.
- Yes, sir.
- Now beat it.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
Annual income £20.
Annual expenditure £19.
Result? Happiness.
Annual income £20.
Annual expenditure £21.
Result? Misery.
That advice is so far worth taking...
I have never taken it myself... and I am the miserable creature you behold.
Grand Hotel. Always the same.
People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.
I was reading a book the other day.
Reading a book?
Yes, it's all about civilization or something.
A nutty kind of a book.
Do you know the guy says... that machinery is going to take the place of every profession?
Oh, my dear.
That's something you need never worry about.
I'd like to run barefoot through your hair.
The picturesque impressions indelibly fixed in our memory.
It is time to conclude our visit... and reluctantly say farewell to Hong Kong... the hub of the Orient.
And as the midnight sun lingers on the skyline of the city... we most reluctantly say farewell to Stockholm...
Venice of the north.
And it is in this paradise of the Canadian Rockies... that we reluctantly say farewell to beautiful Banff.
With this thought, we most reluctantly say... farewell to the Taj Mahal.
We reluctantly say, farewell, colorful Guatemala.
We reluctantly conclude our visit to Japan.
Farewell to Ireland, the Emerald Isle.
Farewell to Switzerland.
Farewell Udaipur.
Farewell to all...
Farewell...
I am Tandaleo.
Jane. Tarzan.
Please stop.
Just walk natural, as if you were out for a stroll.
Not a word.
Hold it right there!
Where are you going with that elephant?
What elephant?
As soon as I saw you, I said to myself:
"There's a hot-looking little number."
Don't let it throw you, champ.
I'm 20 degrees cooler than you think.
Dames are just like traffic.
Sometimes you got to stop.
Sometimes you got to go.
Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs.
You see that chess game over there?
When I was 4 years old,
I played 10 people all at once... blindfolded.
I lost every game.
Lie down.
Stand up.
Grandpa, I love you.
Rosetta, I love you.
Tippy, I love you.
Honey, I love you.
Honey, I love you.
Kippy, I love you.
I love you, Duke.
What're you trying to do?
Steal my gag line?
To begin with, I took four years at Vassar.
Vassar? But that's a girls' college.
I found that out the third year.
I'd have been there yet, but I went out for the swimming team.
It's all right. That's in every contract.
That's what they call a sanity clause.
You can't fool me.
There ain't no Sanity Claus.
Hold me closer.
Closer.
I hold you any closer, I'd be in back of you.
It's a far, far better thing I do, than I have ever done.
It's a far, far better rest I go to... than I have ever known.
You're my Lassie come home.
But, Rhett, if you go... where shall I go? What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
What can I say about Paris that wouldn't be redundant?
Even people who have never been there know of its glories... from songs, books, movies, paintings... even cookbooks.
And thanks to the invention of film and records... there is one national treasure... who will live as long as all the others.
That's Paris.
City of girls and lights!
Maurice Chevalier.
Here he is, singing about his Paris, in one of his early films.
I'm going to Maxim 's
Where all the girls are dreams
Each kiss goes on the wine list
And mine is quite a fine list
Lolo, Dodo, Juju
Cloclo, Margot, Frufru
We promise to be faithful
Until the night is through
Let us gaze in the wine while it's wet
Let's do things that we'll live to regret
Let me dance till the restaurant whirls
With the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
Where there's wine and there's women and song
It is wrong not to do something wrong
When you do something wrong
You must do something right
And I'm doing all right tonight
You know...
I guess more songs have been written about Paris than any other city.
One of the loveliest and most poignant... was by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein.
Dinah Shore sings it in
Till the Clouds Roll by.
The last time I saw Paris her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears
The last time I saw Paris her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they change her
I'll remember her that way
Paris is called the City of Lights.
When these lights are turned on, it becomes the diamond of the world.
Lovers, of course... prefer the romantic shadows along the banks of the Seine.
Another famous Parisian landmark... but of a different kind.
We see Georges Guetary performing... in true Folies-Bergère style.
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm going to get there at any price
Stand aside, I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above, it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm going to get there at any price
Stand aside, I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above, it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
With a new step every day
The place du Trocadéro is one of my favorite places in Paris.
It's a great hangout for children who skate.
So I always bring my kids here to join me.
You know... a number on roller skates, that might not be a bad idea.
This is Montmartre... a very different section of the city.
As you see, the sidewalks are jammed with young artists plying their trade.
Montmartre is also world-renowned for its colorful cabarets.
The cancan, danced by Gwen Verdon and company.
Not far from Paris is Versailles.
One of the most beautiful palaces ever built.
A museum now, it's still used for special state dinners... and charity balls.
Some suggestion of a...
Bal de Versaille... was captured by Ernst Lubitsch in the picture The Merry Widow... filmed in 1934.
Gene dances in the cartoon
Then there's Bing,
He and Louis will croon
Bobby Van could jump over the moon
That's entertainment
You'll see Fred and Judy as tramps
Cyd plays one of those glamorous vamps
Howard Keel,
He'll sum up the whole deal
The world's a cartoon
A great big balloon of entertainment
Hey, Gene, you've had some very unusual dancing partners.
But these, from Invitation to the Dance, beat everything.
Well, you take some skins
Jazz begins
And you take a bass
Man, now we're gettin' someplace
Take a box
One that rocks
Take a blue horn, New Orleans-born
High Society brings Bing and Satchmo together to explain jazz.
Take a bone
Hold the phone
Take a spot
Cool and hot
Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz
Pops, you want to grab a little of what's left here?
- Yeah, daddy, yeah
- Here we go
- If you sail
- A-sailin', sailin'
- Over the sea
- Will you wait for me?
Take my tip, they're all molto hip in Italy
Well, arrivederci
As for France?
- I know you're very big there
- Yes, believe it or not
I do believe
I do indeed
The Frenchmen all prefer what they call
- "Le jazz hot"
- Formidable
Take a plane
Go to Siam
In Bangkok today, round the clock, they all like the jazz
Indians on the Amazon
Beat one bar, and all of them are
Oh, well, gone, man, gone!
From the Equator
Up to the Pole
Everybody wingin', everybody singin'
That rock, rock, rock, rock 'n'roll
And from the east to the west
From the coast to the coast
Jazz is king 'cause jazz is the thing the folks dig most
Now that's jazz
We're a couple of swells
We stop at the best hotels
But we prefer the country far away from the city smells
Fred, here you are with Judy.
Even when you play a tramp, you're in top hat and tails.
The pride of the tennis courts
In June, July, and August we look cute when we're dressed in shorts
The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club
But how are we to get there, that's the rub
That's the rub
We would sail up the avenue but we haven't got a yacht
We would drive up the avenue but the horse we had was shot
We would ride on a trolley car but we haven't got the fare
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue till we're there
We would swim up the avenue but we haven't any lake
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, a walk up the avenue's what we'll take
"V" stands for vim, vigor, vitality, and Bobby Van... in this number from Small Town Girl.
How.
Take me to Broadway, and let me take it from there
Take me to Broadway, and let me take it from there
- Gotta dance!
- Gotta dance!
- Gotta dance!
- Gotta dance!
Cyd Charisse... lovely Cyd Charisse, how she dances.
This from Singin' in the Rain.
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
In Annie Get Your Gun...
Betty Hutton, Howard Keel, Keenan Wynn,
Louis Calhern, and company... tear the screen apart... with Irving Berlin's fabulous anthem to entertainment.
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feelin'
When you are stealin' that extra bow
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the
Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.
They starred in nine films together... and were, undoubtedly, the most successful dramatic team... in screen history.
Let's look at some of their work, together, and apart.
There, that's better. I'm Father Flanagan.
I saw your brother Joe just a little while ago.
We had a long talk about you, Whitey.
Joe wants you to come with me to Boys Town.
You've got a swell chance taking me to that joint.
Look, in a pinch,
I can be tougher than you are... and I guess, maybe, this is the pinch.
You're coming with me to Boys Town because that's what your brother wants.
And that's the way I want it.
Shorty, you mind backing up and letting me by?
Yeah, I do mind. Suppose you back up, and don't call me Shorty.
Shorty or sonny, what difference does it make?
Move over, bud.
I'm wearing Justin boots with 4-inch heels.
They'll sure make big dents in that little frame of yours.
Lady athlete, properly handled, always a market.
Always.
I don't think you've ever been properly handled.
That's right, not even by myself.
Very few brains.
- There's one thing I got to say, though.
- What?
Nicely packed, that kit.
Is, at that.
Not much meat on her, but what's there is cherce.
- Let's get out.
- Okay.
I told you already.
I ain't going to make no deals with you.
- Two against one.
- That's right, two against one... and that's how it is in this business, too, wise guy.
Two against one.
You want your usual percent?
My glasses.
That's no fair.
What's the big idea?
Where are my glasses?
- What is this?
- It's no fair.
Did you ever see a thing like this before?
We're so different, we could help each other, couldn't we?
- I mean, really help. That is, if we...
- What?
Don't rush me. Give me time.
- One, two, three...
- I've been thinking... all sorts of things in all ways.
Backwards, forwards, every which way, but chiefly forwards.
I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past.
Yes, and I've got to thinking maybe you're right.
It is stupid of me, it is selfish... but it is a terrible world to live in alone with just memories.
You've got qualities to face it and do something about it with.
Your eye is so clear. You see straight.
You're so honest, quick, aware, fearless, forthright, and...
- Wait a minute.
- Don't stop me.
I'm none of those, except maybe honest.
I've got qualities for it, too.
I'm strong and have lots of energy.
I'm brave, too. Things don't get me down, and I can take punishment.
It isn't just this house I can offer you or myself as an assistant.
After all we said to each other that night... the way we understand each other about love... you know I never could... and I know you never could or would want to... and then there's all that powerful commodity to be put to use.
- So I thought...
- You thought?
I wondered if you'd like to marry me.
What were you doing down in my bailiwick today?
- Just a little ambulance chasing.
- Successful?
- I got the case.
- What case?
A girl named Doris Attinger shot her husband. I'm going to defend her.
Now, when did you begin to suspect... that you were losing your husband's affection?
When he started batting me around.
Farewell, Amanda
What's the matter?
Don't you want your rub now? What...
What are you, sore about a little slap?
No.
- What then?
- You meant that, didn't you?
- You really meant that.
- No.
I can tell, I know your touch.
- I know a slap from a slug.
- Okay.
I'm not so sure it is.
I'm not so sure I care to expose myself... to typical, instinctive masculine brutality.
Come, now.
It felt not only like you meant it, but like you felt you had a right to.
I can tell.
What have you got back there, radar equipment?
All right.
Break it up.
Adam. Listen to me.
Don't you handle me, lady. I'm not nutty.
Adam, you're sick. Please.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Teaching a lesson.
Him first, then comes yours.
- Now get away, Amanda.
- Don't you do it.
Stop it, Adam. Stop it!
- You've no right.
- That's all I wanted to hear.
Licorice.
If there's anything I'm a sucker for, it's licorice.
- I figure you can take care of yourself.
- No, I can't.
- I bet you could even lick me.
- No, I couldn't.
- Sure. I think so.
- No, I couldn't.
- I need someone to look after me.
- What about me?
Why not?
I don't know if I can lick you or you can lick me...
- but I'll tell you one thing I do know.
- What?
- Together, we can lick them all.
- You bet.
And together they did... because everything about Tracy and Hepburn... was cherce.
Can it be
I like myself
She likes me
So, I like myself
If someone wonderful as she is can think I'm wonderful
I must be quite a guy
Gene, you finally did work out that number on skates, didn't you?
Yes, I guess I did... in a film dreamed up by Comden and Green... called It's Always Fair Weather.
Dislike myself
But now my love has got me ridin'high
She likes me, so, so do I
I can remember everything as if it were yesterday.
- We met at 9.;00
- We met at 8.;00
- I was on time
- No, you were late
Ah yes, I remember it well
Here's my favorite boulevardier with Hermione Gingold... and a lovely Lerner and Loewe song from Gigi.
I remember it well
That dazzling April moon!
There was none that night
And the month was June
That's right, that's right
It warms my heart
To know that you
Remember still
The way you do
Ah yes
I remember it well
- That carriage ride
- You walked me home
- You lost a glove
- I lost a comb
Ah yes, I remember it well
- That brilliant sky!
- We had some rain
- Those Russian songs
- From sunny Spain
Ah yes, I remember it well
You wore a gown of gold
I was all in blue
Am I getting old?
Oh, no not you!
How strong you were
How young and gay
A prince of love in every way
Ah yes
I remember it well
The last time
Ginger and I worked together... was in The Barkley's of Broadway.
I think this is one of the best routines you ever did.
Yes!
No picture about entertainment would be complete... without a number from wet and wonderful Esther Williams.
And she does it without trick photography.
A show that is really a show
Sends you out with a kind of a glow
And you say as you go on your way
That's entertainment
The art that appeals to the heart
Is a song that just has to belong
Or a dance that is sure to entrance
That's entertainment
And now may we pause
For a moment or two?
Because there's a chore that we feel we should do
We'd like to name just a few of the stars
You have seen here
Performing a song or scene here
There were
Judy Garland, Leslie Caron,
Greta Garbo, Doris Day
Bob Taylor, Jack Buchanan,
Tony Martin, Maurice Chevalier
Bing Crosby, Mickey Rooney,
Eleanor Powell, Nanette Fabray
That's entertainment
Clark Gable, Melvyn Douglas,
Bob Montgomery, John Barrymore
Hermione Gingold, Esther Williams,
Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore
- Franchot Tone, Greer Garson
- Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy
Roddy McDowall, Myrna Loy, and William Powell
Jeanette MacDonald, Debbie Reynolds,
Marge and Gower Champion
Ann Miller, Cary Grant, Ann Sothern,
Louis Armstrong, Bobby Van
Jean Harlow, Cyd Charisse,
Joan Crawford, Vivien Leigh, Tarzan
That makes forty-two
We've missed many who have entertained you
And if it's a hit, then they'll go on from there
They played a charade that was lighter than air
A good old-fashioned affair
As we sing this finale
We hope it was up your alley
No death like you get in Macbeth
No ordeal like the end of Camille
This goodbye brings a tear to the eye
The world is a stage
The stage is the world of entertainment
English
One day, when I was 6 years old,
I saw a magnificent picture in a nature book about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing an animal.
I'm trying to make a sketch of it to show you.
Under this splendid picture, it said;
"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."
There.
"And then remain stationary for six months digesting it."
I pondered that deeply.
And after some work, I succeeded in making my first drawing.
I called it Drawing Number One.
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups.
I asked them if it frightened them.
Frighten us?
Why should we be frightened of a hat?
A hat?
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
Obviously.
Since the grownups were not able to understand it, I made another, showing the elephant inside the boa constrictor, so they could see it clearly.
My Drawing Number Two.
This time, I was told to stop wasting my time drawing boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and attend to my studies, which I did.
And that is why, at the age of 6,
I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
As I grew up, whenever I'd meet one who seemed to be at all clear-sighted, in order to find out if he was really a person of true understanding,
I would show him my first drawing.
But whoever it was would say;
It's a hat, it's a hat
It's a sort of a kind of hat
Painted poorly
But it surely is a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
There's no doubt of it, it's a hat
Top of Papa
Is its proper habitat
My, oh, my, look at that
Why, this dummy has drawn a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
If it's anything, it's a hat
Why, it's nothing but a common
Himalayan mountain hat
A hat that looks like down upon
Which someone must've sat
Not Picasso or Corot
But a very nice chapeau
Are you kidding?
It's a hat, you silly brat
Every grownup was the same
Uniformly, they'd exclaim
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I could see it wasrt won'th
Spending time with them on earth
There were fewer in the sky
I decided I would fly
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I need air
Where only stars get in my hair
And only eagles stop and stare
I need air
All the world is mad
And I have had my share
I need air
I need air
I need air
One hour of mortal wear and tear
Gives my morale moral-de-mer
Any corner lot
That heavers got to spare
I need air
I need air
There's not a sign of life down there
Just hats and grownups everywhere
I need air
Lots of cozy sky
That God and I can share
I need air
I need air
Over the years,
I came to know many grownups, and my opinion of them never improved.
In time, I stopped showing my drawing and never again mentioned boa constrictors, elephants or stars.
Instead, I would talk about golf, money, politics and neckties.
And everyone was pleased to have met such a sensible man.
So I lived my life alone, without anyone I could really talk to, until a short time ago.
I was testing a new plane, racing it against the clock from Paris to India.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Come in, please, over.
F-BDXY to Paris.
Ground speed: 1 -9-0.
Running ten minutes behind schedule.
Strong headwinds.
Trouble!
- Losing altitude!
- Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Are you there, F-BDXY?
Where are you?
If you please, draw me a sheep.
Will you?
- Will I what?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Who are...?
Where did you...?
How did you...?
How did you get here?
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you to draw me a sheep.
No, no. Listen to me.
- Where did you come from?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Don't you know any other words?
Is that all you can say?
No.
Will you draw me a sheep?
When a mystery is too overpowering, one doesn't dare disobey.
A thousand miles from civilization and death at my heels,
I picked up a pad and pencil and began to draw.
Look, I...
I don't know how to draw.
- That doesn't matter.
- And I certainly can't draw a sheep.
I've only drawn one thing in my whole life.
Here.
Oh, no. I don't want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
A boa constrictor is very dangerous, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
Where I live, everything is very small.
What I need is a sheep.
Do you live in a small town?
On a small island?
Where is it very small?
What sort of object is that?
- What?
- That.
It's called an aeroplane.
It flies.
I was flying in it, but it broke down.
Then you must have dropped from the sky.
That's right.
You too. How funny.
If you don't mind, I prefer having my misfortunes taken seriously.
- What do you mean, "you too"?
- That's a very sick-Iooking sheep.
Is that how you got here?
In a plane that crashed?
Could you make another?
- Why?
- Because that one doesn't look well.
This is not the way two strangers get to know each other on the average desert.
This is the way.
Ask me a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Good.
To which I reply,
"I come from Paris."
Now I'll ask you a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it's on this planet.
I'm sorry, it won't do.
- Why not?
- See for yourself.
That's not a sheep.
It's a ram. It has horns.
Do you think this is all I have to do?
I have this engine to take apart and fix before my water runs out.
I have no time to draw for a little boy dressed in a coat, carrying a sword, who appears from nowhere in the middle of the Sahara.
There, and that's the last.
There's no horns.
No.
It's not sick.
No.
- Well, then?
- It's old.
I'm sorry.
It's only his box.
The sheep you asked for is inside.
That's perfect, exactly the way I wanted it.
It is?
Good.
Do you think this sheep will need a lot of grass?
- Why?
- I told you.
Where I come from, everything is very small.
Don't worry.
It's a very small sheep.
This sheep isn't so small.
Alas, I couldn't argue with him.
I'd grown too old to see sheep through the walls of boxes.
Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it is.
Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget.
But why did you ask?
- Arert you from this planet?
- The thing that's so good about this box is, at night, he can use it as his house.
- He's just going to sleep.
- Oh, sorry.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Where in God's name could you have come from?
- Do you know what asteroids are?
- What whats are?
- Asteroids.
- No.
They're very, very small planets.
The smallest, Asteroid B-61 2, was discovered by a Turkish astronomer in 1 909.
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that mean they also eat baobab bushes?
- Who?
- The sheep.
Do they also eat flowers?
- Do they?
- Just hold it a minute, will you?
- Do they also eat flowers?
- What?
Oh, yes, they do.
Except the flowers that have thorns, of course.
No, they even eat the flowers that have thorns.
But the thorns protect them, don't they?
Maybe from being picked, but not from being eaten.
Then what's the good of having them?
- Having what?
- Thorns.
I don't know. Spite, I suppose.
Flowers have thorns just for spite.
I don't believe you.
Flowers are weak and helpless, and they know it.
How could they face the world if they didn't believe they were protected?
- What I'm doing here is important.
- Important?
Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years.
And for millions of years, sheep have been eating them just the same.
Eating them.
And you think that's not important?
- Of course it is.
- I know one flower that's unique in all the world.
It grows nowhere but on my planet.
But some morning, a sheep can come along and destroy it with one single bite.
And you think that's not important?
- I suppose so.
- What you don't understand is, that if someone loves one flower that grows on one star among all the millions and millions of stars in the sky, it's enough to make him happy to look at the stars.
He can say to himself,
"Somewhere my flower's up there."
But if a sheep eats the flower, in one moment, all the stars will go dark.
And you think that's not important?
It's not a matter of consequence to you, is it?
Wait!
Wait! Come back!
I most humbly apologize.
I was behaving like a grownup.
Your flower is very important.
I swear it.
Come back!
Please!
Please come back!
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Little man, don't you know
That I'm on your side?
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Little man, let me show you
I'm on your side
This world
Is an ocean without any shore
When you're on your own
Dawn is the end of the rope
When you're all alone
I've been, I've seen
I've known it
Where can you be?
Where can you be?
Hurry back, and you'll see
That I'm on your side
Where did you run?
Why did you run
From the one, only one
Who is on your side?
Everybody needs a friend
Come make use of me
God gave people hands to lend
Mine are free
So why stay away?
Come what may
I'm on
Your side
I missed him.
I wished I'd discovered more about him.
But he'd gone and taken his mystery with him.
Unaccustomed as I am to drawing anything but boa constrictors and elephants,
I decided to make a portrait of him so that I wouldn't forget him.
After all, he was a friend.
And not everyone has a friend.
Least of all me.
I'm hungry.
I have your supper right here.
I waited as long as I could.
I'd advise saving some of that till tomorrow.
That is, of course, unless you're very hungry.
Is this all you have?
Well, at the moment, yes.
This will be quite enough, thank you.
Needless to say, that problem you outlined, concerning the flower you know.
The one on the star, and your sheep...
In fact, all flowers and all sheep, that's...
That's extremely important.
In fact, I can't think of anything that's more important.
Well, I've been giving it a great deal of thought, and I...
I think I've come up with a solution that will remove your flower from any possibility of danger.
Now, this is my plan.
But this is subject to your approval, of course.
One, to draw a muzzle for your sheep.
Two...
If you can describe your planet to me in sufficient detail for me to make a drawing of it,
I'll put up a big, strong fence all around your flower.
Would you really do that?
Smaller.
Smaller.
I have three volcanoes.
- How big are they?
- Very big.
- Compared to you?
- Knee-high.
I have to clean them out every day.
- All by yourself?
- There's no one else.
There are three baobab bushes.
You don't have to draw them.
They don't come up for a while.
- Where's your house?
- On the other side.
You don't have to draw that either.
And my flower lives on this side here.
When she first came through the ground,
I was afraid she was going to be a baobab, but then she blossomed.
One bright, yellow morning, she blossomed.
- Good morning.
- Stop.
What is it?
- Give me a moment to wake up.
- I'm sorry.
How beautiful you are.
Yes, I know.
I was born at the same moment as the sun.
- Did you know that?
- No.
- Did you know you were quite selfish?
- Selfish?
Instead of thinking of my needs, you're standing there doing what you want to do, which is stare at me.
- What is it you need?
- Water.
- Water?
- I realize this is a small,
- unequipped little planet.
- I'll get it for you right away.
I brought her some water.
I brought it every day.
I did everything I could for her.
It's cooler when the sun goes down.
Do you have a glass bowl to put over me?
That will only make you weaker.
The night air is good for you.
I'm cold!
I'm cold!
You promised me a glass bowl.
It's not cold.
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you very much.
You've made my planet beautiful.
I don't believe it.
If you loved me, you'd know how cold I am.
I promise you, the nights aren't long.
You'll soon get used to it.
- Do you love me?
- I'll get the bowl.
I couldn't understand it, and I couldn't understand her.
I loved her, but I was so unappy.
I began to realize
I didn't really understand anything.
So I decided to leave my planet and go out into the universe and try to learn something.
I was wrong to leave her.
But at the time,
I didn't even understand that.
I was too young.
One morning,
I cleaned out my volcanoes, took one last look for baobabs and put my planet in order.
Good morning.
- You're all dressed up.
- Yes.
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.
- You're going away, aren't you?
- Yes.
- For a long time?
- Perhaps.
I see.
It's my fault you're going, isn't it?
I've been very foolish, haven't I?
I wonder who will call on me when you're not here.
There are those two caterpillars, of course.
I don't like them, but one has to put up with them if one wants to meet butterflies.
For anything else, I have my thorns.
Well...
...if you're going...
: : : go:
- Goodbye.
- Be happy, be happy, be happy
Forget that I have no one
And nowhere to go
Be happy, be happy, be happy
Don't think of me in winter
All covered with snow
Be happy, be happy
Forget that I'll be crying still
And never
Will be happy
Be happy
Without you
Stop!
- Where are your papers?
- What papers?
You can't cross the border without papers.
- What border?
- That border there.
- You need a visa. Do you have one?
- No.
Then you can't cross it.
Those are the rules. Stop!
You almost backed into another country.
What are you? A smuggler?
A refugee? An idealist?
- Speak up. What are you?
- I'm ignorant.
Well, you might outgrow it.
Now, look...
My country is too small for both of us, but I have a colonial possession
1 foot to your left.
If your papers are in order, you can settle down there.
Your Majesty, it's such a small planet.
Why do you need borders?
Why do we need borders?
Yes. Why do you need borders?
You told me to ask questions.
But any child understands why we need borders.
- I don't.
- Well, of course you don't understand.
You're a child.
How do you expect
You can understand
International things and stuff?
Scissoring the earth
Carving up the land
Is the business of kings and stuff
Continentally, you are mentally
A silly-billy boy of 2
How absurd, it's uneard-of
You can never think as grownups do
Why, you
Why, you
Oh, you're a child
You're a child
You're a twerp
And that's putting it mild
You're a speck
You're a fleck
And it's just too tough
Pounding grown-up stuff
In the bean of a green little child
- Try.
- What?
Explain it to me. I want to learn.
Well...
Why do borderlines exist?
Well, first and foremost on the list
If all the borders were destroyed
Tomorrow, I'd be unemployed
And what would statesmen do for fun
If all at once the world was one?
And one could wander
Where he pleases
Flashing smiles instead of visas
Why, it could
It might
It would
Oh, go away and grow
Come again when you're
Not a mini-brained punk like this
You are really too undeveloped
For philosophical junk like this
Too adult is it? Difficult is it?
To get your teeth into?
Too bewildering for the children
And that, of course, means you
Means you
Means you
You're a child
You're a child
And the kind that can
Drive grownups wild
You're a wee little pea
Any thought profound
That I might expound
Wort fit into a pineaded child
Is that clear?
Now, where are your papers?
- I don't have any.
- You can't stay without papers.
Then I'll leave.
Just as well. You're dangerous.
Where's your passport?
- I don't have a passport.
- Then you can't leave.
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Four hundred million and 997,000...
...plus six, equals 400,997,006!
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Five hundred million and ten!
Five hundred million and ten.
Plus one.
Five hundred million and 32!
Five hundred million, 32 what?
Five hundred million and 32 plus three.
Those things.
Five hundred million and 35.
- Stars?
- That's it. Stars.
Five hundred...
...million, 44.
- Plus...
- Why are you counting the stars?
Five hundred million...
I own them, and I want to see how much I have.
But what good does it do you to own the stars?
- It does me the good of making me rich.
- What good is it to be rich?
Because...
I don't know.
But how can you own the stars?
When you find a diamond that doesn't belong to anyone, it's yours.
If you get an idea before anyone else, it's yours.
So I got the idea of owning the stars.
You want to stay here? Fine.
You can help me count.
But if I owned a flower,
I could do something for it.
What can you do for the stars?
You wouldn't understand.
You're a child.
Gimme, how can you
Gimme, understand
Gimme, gimme,
Financial stuff?
Gimme, your supply
Gimme, my demand
Mentally is gigantial stuff
Gimme oodles of
Gimme boodles of
I don't care what
But give me more
You're too poor and immature to know
What there are gimme-gimmes for
Why, you're
Why, you're
You're a child
You're a child
You're too darling and dopey and mild
You're a nit
Half a wit
Speaking wisdom-wise
Private enterprise
Is too big
For a twig of a child
Oh, stocks and bonds!
I've lost me place!
Now I shall have to start all over again.
Here, add up these figures.
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm searching for knowledge.
Oh, good.
You've come to the right place.
It's been said that I am the greatest historian in history.
That's wonderful, sir.
Who said it?
I said it. I wrote it.
I read it. It's printed.
Consequently, it's fact.
It's history.
And now that you're here,
I shall put you down.
In history, I mean.
- Where did you come from?
- From another planet, sir.
- What was it called?
- I don't know, sir.
Oh, good, I'll give it a name.
I like making things up.
That's my job, making things up.
I'm an historian.
Let me see. Planet...
Alice! Do you like that?
Oh, no, sir. The planet Alice?
I don't like it at all.
No wonder you left it.
Here. Read my latest, an official version of the French Revolution.
The other ones are now totally inoperative.
Is that the truth, sir?
- What?
- The truth.
How do you spell it?
Never mind, sir.
I don't think I'd better stay.
Right. Wipe!
Left. Left. Left.
Shoulders back. Left. Left. Left.
Left. Left. On your feet, boy.
On your feet.
Where's your arm, boy? Where?
- My arm?
- The colors. The colors.
The flag.
Sir, I don't see anyone.
How could you?
There's no one there, silly ass.
Get those shoulders back. Back. Back!
Not that much. Watch it.
Stand easy.
Welcome to the base.
State your business.
I'm trying to learn about life, sir.
- Learn about what?
- Life.
Life? Oh, life. That.
Yes, of course.
Company, double-quick march!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
You want to know what life is about?
Dying! That's what it's all about.
Die like a hero, boy.
That's the way to live. Company, halt!
Boy, this is your lucky day.
We just happen to have an opening.
There's not a blankety-blank soldier in the whole army. Just a general, me.
I can outthink the enemy but just can't fight them.
Enemy? What enemy?
There isn't any, dunce!
You've got to have your army first.
Then you find your enemy.
Company, on your stomachs! Crawl!
Join up, lad.
The army needs you, your country needs you, and most of all, I need you.
Every young man wants to be a soldier.
Speak up, boy. Any questions?
Which way is the next planet?
The next planet?
Oh, the next planet. It is called...
You know, it's that round thing.
It's called...
Dirt. No.
Mud.
No. Earth!
That's it, Earth. Bring up the cannon!
- Company, on your...
- Which way is it?
- Which way is what?
- Earth.
Earth? Oh, Earth.
That way. Crawl, men!
Shoulders back! Shoulders down!
What about it, boy...?
Come back!
Who said that?
Who are you?
Be my friend.
I'm alone.
"What a queer planet," I thought.
Everyone says the same thing.
Just about.
That was just one year ago, and all I've learned since I left her is that I should never have left her.
All of those little games of hers,
I didn't see all of the affection that was underneath.
One should never listen to flowers, should one?
I wouldn't know.
My experience is limited.
Oh, I have met a Daisy
But where we met is hazy
And I have walked the streets
With Marguerites
And clinging vines beside me
Oh, I've met a lot of those
But I never met a Rose
There's often been a Heather
An armful altogether
And I have even met
A Violet
Who almost satisfied me
Yes, I've met every kind that grows
But I never met a Rose
Among the Dahlias
I often dally
I left a Lily in the valley
But now and then, I ponder
And wonder as I wander
Among the fields and shrub
Perhaps the trouble is...
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Perhaps you werert really looking for one.
Perhaps.
While roaming through the clover
Could I have passed her over?
When all is said and done
Am I the one to blame?
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you feeling all right?
Why don't you rest for a little while.
I can't. We've run out of water.
Unless I can get this thing off the ground...
But I will.
Don't worry, I will.
- I'm not worried.
- Good.
We'll get some water from the well.
Well? What well?
- Out there.
- What?
- Did you see an oasis?
- No, but there must be one out there.
No.
We could get lost and never find water and never make it back to the plane.
No, I'd rather bet on the motor.
At least we know it can work.
- Where are you going?
- To the well.
I said we were staying here.
This way.
Why not this way?
Or that way or that way?
This way.
Coming?
This is suicide, don't you understand? Suicide.
Then maybe I won't have to find my friend The Snake.
- What are you saying?
- It doesn't matter.
It does matter. What snake?
I'll tell you about him later.
- Tell me now.
- You can't draw while you're walking.
The stars are beautiful because of a flower I can't see.
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
There is a reason
Lovely to tell
Because the desert
Is hiding a well
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
Millions of reasons
Tell me just one
At night, the desert
Is hiding the sun
Look! Look!
It's water.
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
- Why are you happy?
- Why do you think?
Because there's plenty
Of water to drink
Why was the desert
So lovely before?
Why was it lovely
But not anymore?
Water was hiding
No one could see
But now the water
Is hiding in me
- You mustrt forget your promise.
- What promise?
You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I won't forget.
But first, I want to hear more about that snake.
- Now?
- Now.
Very well, then.
I met him in a tree at the edge of the desert, not far from here.
There are some hills here.
He was the first real person I met when I landed here.
And until I met someone else,
I thought everyone on Earth was a snake.
I arrived on the other side of the tree.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You're talking to the wrong end.
You're a funny animal.
You're nothing but a tail.
Where's the rest?
- I'm not an animal.
- What are you?
What am I?
I'm a snake.
- I'm enchanted.
- Well, you should be.
You're all cold and slimy.
Thank you. It runs in the family.
Could you tell me what I've landed on?
Yes. This sunny section of the solar system is called the Sahara.
The name of this planet is Sahara?
No, no, no, no. This simmering spot of singing sand is called the Sahara.
The whole silly, stupid, smelly sphere is called the Earth.
Oh, good. I thought I'd come to the wrong place.
Oh, you have.
Listen.
You look like a nice fellow.
Why don't you take off your sword and stay a while.
You seem like a smart, sensible sort.
Why did you swing down to this sorry, sleazy swamp?
- I'm trying to learn something.
- I see.
Well, sir, this speck in space is a scholastic sewer.
All that you can learn here is sorrow. Sorrow.
If I were you, I'd scram.
I can't, my flock of birds have flown away.
- So?
- They brought me here.
I see.
Listen, you are so lucky that you met me.
Why am I lucky?
Well, you see, if someday, any day, you want to see your own small, sparkling star again,
I may have a solution.
You see, I have this special... sting.
It's almost painless, and it can send you scooting out of this sad slum and sailing into the sweet, sunny, splendiferous sky.
Really?
If you would like to cure the fever
Called life
Get some relief from all the struggle
And strife
The grandest medicine
That I can propose
Is under your nose
A snake in the grass
If you would like a spot
Where life never goes
Where you can leave your body
Home in your clothes
The finest travel agent
You'll ever meet
Is right at your feet
A snake in the grass
One sting
And you can say goodbye
To all of your friends
One sting
And you'll be singing
As your spirit ascends
All's well that ends
So any day or night
Wherever you are
If you would like to take
A trip to a star
The quickest transportation
Yet known to Man
Is none other than
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
If you would like to leave
That inuman race
And take up residence
Out yonder, in space
When you are ready
To go traveling on
Sit right down upon
A snake in the grass
One sting
Is quite enough to make you
Happy and free
One sting
And you'll discover
How relaxed you can be
Posthumously
And while you're wandering through
The heavenly blue
If you should see the Lord come
Strolling in view
Go up and say you bring him
Best wishes from his fallen old chum
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
One sting.
It's almost painless.
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
I'll be waiting.
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.
Are you looking for that snake in order to do away with yourself?
I can't get back to my planet any other way.
It's too far, and my birds have disappeared.
Well, of all the...
You...
Now, you listen to me. That snake's poisoned you against the Earth.
- It's not what The Snake said.
- He's hated us since the world began.
- It's what The Fox said.
- I'll tell you right now, you're not going to allow yourself to be poisoned. Is that clear?
- What fox?
- The fox I met after I met The Snake.
I see.
You certainly got yourself mixed up with a strange crowd.
All right, let's have it.
- Where did you meet The Fox?
- In a garden of roses.
How many roses in the garden,
I don't know how many roses, but if it's too difficult to draw...
No. No. Not at all.
Let's get every detail of this whole sordid nonsense out in the open.
When she finds out there are millions of flowers that look just like her, it will break her heart.
Good morning.
I thought I was rich.
I thought I had the most unique flower in all the world.
But all I had was a common rose.
A common rose and three volcanoes that came up to my knees.
And one of them was extinct at that.
That doesn't make me a very great prince, does it?
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're a prince?
Yes.
I'm a fox.
I'm sad. Would you play with me?
- No.
- Why not? It'll be fun.
Where are the others?
- What others?
- The other hunters.
There's no one here but me.
Please play with me.
I won't harm you.
- Then why do you have a gun?
- I don't have a gun.
- You must. You're a human being.
- I'm from another planet.
- Arert there guns on your planet?
- No.
Really?
- Are there hunters on your planet?
- No.
- Any chickens?
- No.
- Oh, well, nothing's perfect.
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
I can't play with you.
- I'm not tamed.
- What do you mean, "tamed"?
Can't you stay put? I'm getting dizzy.
Sorry. I just don't wish to become extinct.
Do you mean, if I move, you will disappear again?
- Of course.
- Why?
You're a human. I'm a fox.
I hunt chickens, you hunt foxes.
- But I don't.
- You're a human, and you also lie.
But I don't lie.
Then you're inuman.
To be tamed...
Let me know before you move.
See if this clears it up. Underneath the prince, you're a little boy.
Just like a million other little boys.
I'm a fox.
Just like a million other foxes.
But if you tame me...
...I won't be like all the other foxes, and you won't be like the little boys.
I'll be unique to you, and you to me.
- You understand?
- Sort of.
- Where are you?
- You moved.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
I have a very monotonous life.
I hunt chickens.
Men hunt me. They come, I hide.
They leave, I come out.
That's all.
But if you tamed me, everything would be different.
- Even the wheat fields.
- The wheat fields?
Of course.
I don't like bread, so I don't care about wheat. Wheat is the color of gold.
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat because it would remind me of you.
I'm going to sit down.
What would I have to do?
Well, every day, you would come and sit where you're sitting now.
You'd always come at the same time.
At, let's say, 4 in the afternoon.
I could start to get excited about... Oh, about 3:00.
If you came at any old time,
I couldn't get keyed up.
But what would I do at 4:00?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Of course not. If you did, I'd get frightened and I wouldn't come out.
It's like this.
At first, I'll hide behind the trees.
Trembling...
...as I do in winter.
In time
I'll start to feel at ease
Show my face
And we'll
- Beginter
- "Beginter"?
Get closer.
And closer.
And closer.
We'll go a glance at a time
A small advance at a time
We'll be afraid a bit
And shy a bit
Avoid each other's eye a bit
Less often each day
The ice will soften each day
As we get closer
And closer and closer
We'll go a blush at a time
A happy flush at a time
Begin to laugh a bit
And stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer
And closer and closer
And then one day
There'll come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Then we'll jump miles at a time
A million smiles at a time
Begin to love a lot
And live a lot
And give and give and give a lot
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
A little closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
And then one day
There will come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Begin to laugh a bit and stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer and closer
And closer
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
- A little closer
- And closer
- And closer
- And closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
After I tamed him, we stayed together for quite a while.
But then one day,
I had to say goodbye.
I think I'm going to cry.
I didn't want to make you unappy, but you asked me to tame you.
- I know.
- Then I haven't done you much good.
- It's all been a waste of time.
- No.
Because you wasted so much time on me...
...you made me feel very important.
But now I feel sort of responsible for you.
I should have warned you that would happen.
You always feel responsible for what you've tamed.
The moment he said that,
I understood everything.
He wasrt like all the other foxes in the world anymore.
I tamed him, and now he was unique, at least to me.
And my flower wasrt like all those other flowers, because I had fetched her a screen and put a glass bowl over her at night and listened when she grumbled, and now she was my rose.
And I was responsible for her, and
I had to go back and take care of her.
I brought you a present.
It's a secret.
So I wrote it down.
The last time I saw him, he was sitting in a wheat field.
What was the secret?
It's only with the heart that one can see clearly.
What's essential...
...is invisible to the eye.
It works!
Eureka! It works!
I need air!
It works.
It works!
Wait.
Don't.
My God. What have you done?
No.
Don't.
I'm glad you've repaired your engine.
Now you can go back home.
- Yes.
- I, too, am going back home.
You must keep your promise.
- What promise?
- You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I'm responsible for this flower.
Please. You promised.
You also forgot the fence.
It's a very nice muzzle and fence.
Thank you.
You're cold as ice.
Are you afraid?
Please leave me.
I can't.
I won't.
I don't want you to suffer.
I'll look as if I'm dead, but it won't be true.
It's just that it's too far to carry this body with me.
You understand, don't you?
This part of me will be like an old, abandoned shell.
There's nothing sad about old shells, is there?
My star is so small
I can't show you where it is.
I'm going back there now, but before
I do, I want to give you something.
All I want is to hear you laugh again.
You will hear me laugh.
More than you ever did before, because on one of those stars,
I'll be laughing, but you won't know which one.
So they'll all be laughing, all the stars.
It will be like a bell that's hanging from every star in the sky.
There now, that's all.
Little Prince
From who knows where
Was it a star?
Was it a prayer?
With every smile
You clear the air
So I can see
Oh, Little Prince
Don't take your smile
Away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Please, Little Prince
Don't take your smile away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Where are you?
I won't leave without you!
Oh, my God.
It never happened.
He wasrt here.
It never happened.
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
SOUND SO MANY TRUMPETS?
I'M NOT JEHOVAH.
WHY CAN'T A PRINCE
COME HOME WITHOUT A FUSS?
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE
HE IS A PRINCE, SIR.
OTHER PEOPLE CAN SNEAK IN
THE BACK WAY UNANNOUNCED,
WHICH IS HOW
IT SHOULD BE.
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?
OH, WAS
I SMILING, SIR?
JUST THE SUDDEN WARMTH
CRACKING MY FACE.
A PRINCE'S LOT IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A BORE.
YOUR FACE CRACKS
RATHER EASILY, DOESN'T IT?
NOW, YOU MARK
MY WORDS,
BEFORE YOU
CAN COUNT TO 10,
THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WITH THE ODIOUS PUNCTUALITY
OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S
MUCH VAUNTED,
RECENTLY INVENTED, HIDEOUSLY
IRRITATING CUCKOO CLOCK,
WILL COME OUR DEAR
AND LOYAL SUBJECT,
THE EVER-UNCTUOUS
LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN.
Man: 7!
HE'S IMPROVING.
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
HE'S GOING TO ACHIEVE
THE ELUSIVE
10-MINUTE MILE.
HA HA HA HA!
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
AH, WELCOME HOME.
WELCOME HOME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
MY LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN,
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE.
I AM COMMANDED BY
HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
YOUR FATHER,
AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN, YOUR MOTHER--
YES, YES, NOW,
DON'T TIRE YOURSELF,
I AM ACQUAINTED
WITH THEM.
HOW ARE MY
DOTING PARENTS?
THEIR MAJESTIES ARE NATURALLY
MOST ANXIOUS TO HEAR
SUCH GLAD TIDINGS
I FEEL SURE YOU BEAR
CONCERNING YOUR RECENT
ABSENCE FROM THE COURT.
NAMELY, THE MATTER
OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
AND BETROTHAL TO THE PRINCESS
SELINA OF CAROLSFELD.
INDEED, IN ANTICIPATION
OF SUCH WONDERFUL NEWS,
HIS MAJESTY THE KING
HAS DECIDED TO MAKE YOU
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID THE MARTYR.
WHICH IS USUALLY
AWARDED POSTHUMOUSLY.
A SUITABLE HONOR,
AS IT HAPPENS,
FOR THE MATTER OF MY BETROTHAL
IS VERY STATUS QUO.
I DID NOT FIND THE LADY OF
YOUR CHOICE TO BE MY CHOICE.
OH, BUT, SIR--
WE ARE RETURNED...
AS WE DEPARTED.
THE KING I'M SURE,
AND INDEED MY DEAR MAMA
WILL SHARE
YOUR NOTICEABLE GRIEF.
Chamberlain: INDEED, SIR,
THE WHOLE COURT WILL BE GRIEVED.
WELL, SO BE IT.
ANY SIMPLE PEASANT IS
AFFORDED THE ABILITY
IN LOVE...
TO WIN OR LOSE
WHILE I OF THE NOBILITY
AM ROBBED OF THE FACILITY
TO CHOOSE
ANY SERF OR SERVANT
CAN BY NATURAL SELECTION
ELECT HIMSELF A MATE
IF SHE'S AMENABLE
BUT DUE TO MY HIGH BREEDING,
I'M CONTINUALLY ACCEDING
TO DEMANDS
I FIND INCREASINGLY
UNTENABLE
ALL I ASK, AND IT'S A
SIMPLE ENOUGH REQUEST--
WELL, FOLLOW ME,
BY ALL MEANS, FOLLOW ME.
I WISH TO KNOW,
I DEMAND TO KNOW...
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
WHY CAN'T I LIVE
TWO ROLES?
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME PERFORM
ALL THE CLOYING AMENITIES TI
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME
BE A FREE AND HAPPY SOUL?</>
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
SPLIT MYSELF RIGHT IN HALF
THEN I COULD SATISFY
AND MOLLIFY
AND PACIFY AND QUALIFY
WHILE THE OTHER ME
WOULD HAVE
A HELL OF
A HEALTHY LAUGH, HA? '11
THE CUSTOM OF ROYALTY
IN REFERRING TO ONESELF
IS TO NATURALLY EMPLOY
THE ROYAL "WE“
"WE ARE VERY HAPPY" SI
Y, “WE ARE VERY SAD“ “I
“WE ARE BORED
AND SUFFER FROM ENNUI"
FOR A ROYAL PRINCE,
THERE'S NO SUCH WORD AS “ME"
IT'S ALWAYS "WE“
SO, RIGHTFULLY, I
SHOULD BE TWO on THREE
DON'T YOU AGREE?
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
PERHAPS NOT.
SO, I ASK MYSELF...
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
WHY CAN'T I PLAY
TWO PARTS?
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME ENDURE
THE APPALLING FORMALITIES
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME
HAVE A FREE
AND HAPPY HEART?
IF I COULD BE
TWO PEOPLE
LIFE WOULD NOT
PASS ME BY
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO PICK AND CHOOSE
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO WIN OR LOSE
AND MAYBE ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE...
BEFORE WE DIE!
DIE? WHO'S DIED?
AH! AT LAST!
OUR DEAR SON.
WE ARE... WE ARE...
WE'RE WHAT?
DELIGHTED.
YES, DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU RETURN.
OH!
AH, YES, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.
Prince: FATHER...
Chamberlain:
YOUR MAJESTY--
KNEEL, SIR.
FATHER.
I DO NOT WISH" IT WOULD
BE MOST INAPPROPRIATE...
YOUR MAJESTY, HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS HAS RETURNED--
OF COURSE HE'S RETURNED! YOU
GET MORE SENILE EVERY DAY.
I HAVE RETURNED,
FATHER--
NOW YOU' RE
CATCHING IT.
EMPTY-HANDED.
KNEEL, SIR.
FATHER, THIS IS
MOST EMIBARRASSING.
I COMMAND YOU
TO KNEEL, SIR!
I DON'T DESERVE IT.
I HAVEN'T EARNED IT.
NOBODY EARNS THIS.
IT'S GIVEN BECAUSE I AM
THE KING AND I LIKE IT.
WHERE'S MY SWORD?
AH! IT'S FAR
TOO HEAVY.
YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN WITH THE
CURSE OF THE WEAK WRISTS.
OH, I DO SO LOVE
A CEREMONY.
AH, THAT'S BETTER.
I DUB THEE--
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
SHOULDN'T THERE BE
SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
I HAVE IT HERE.
YOUR MAJESTY--FATHER,
DO WE--MUST I-- us, or COURSE,
YOU MUST. AHEM!
“LET IT BE KNOWN
TO ALL HERE PRESENT
“THAT BY OUR COMMAND
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
“THE PRINCE
EDWARD CHARLES
"ALBERT GEORGE JAMES
RICHARD AUGUSTUS PHILIP
HAS RECEIVED
OUR GRACIOUS FAVOR.“
ER... WHO WROTE THIS?
YOU DID, SIRE.
AH, YES, WELL,
IT'S MAGNIFICENT STUFF.
WELL WORTH
PAYING ATTENTION TO.
“FROM THIS DAY HENCEFORTH
SHALL BE ENTITLED
"TO BE KNOWN AS
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF
SAINT DAVID THE BLESSED MARTYR. "
THERE'S... SOMEBODY
IN THE ROOM!
VERY FINE. NOW I KISS
YOU ON BOTH CHEEKS.
THAT'S THE PART
I LIKE BEST.
I SOMETIMES GIVE MEDALS
TO A WHOLE REGIMENT.
GOOD. VERY
TOUCHING CEREMONY.
Chamberlain:
MOST TOUCHING, SIRE.
SYCOPHANT!
DON'T ALWAYS HAVE
TO AGREE, YOU KNOW.
CONGRATULATIONS,
DEAR COUSIN.
OH, LORD!
WHO LET HIM IN?
CONGRATULATIONS !
I HEARD ALL THE TRUMPETS.
NOW, DON'T YOU START.
OH! A LITTLE
PREMATURE, AM I?
I SAY, HAVE I DROPPED THE
TINIEST OF SOCIAL BRICKETTES?
I MEAN, I WAS BEING
QUITE SINCERE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, AS
SINCERE AS I EVER AM.
OH, no!
WHO IS IT? HAS THERE BEEN
AN UPRISING?
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. IT'S
JUST THE DUKE OF MONTAGUE.
IS HE STILL ALIVE?
I THOUGHT WE BURIED HIM.
FATHER, EVER SINCE
I ENTERED THIS ROOM,
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT
WHAT YOU EXPECTED OF ME
DID NOT TAKE PLACE.
MY THROW, I THINK.
No, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE CHEATING AGAIN.
KINGS NEVER CHEAT. THEY
ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES,
BUT THEY NEVER CHEAT.
IF I MAY, SIR,
BY roux LEAVE,
THIS THING
IS CHOKING ME.
YOU SEE HOW
I'M PLACED?
ACCUSED IN FRONT OF THE
COURT BY MY OWN WIFE.
FATHER,
THIS IS SERIOUS.
OF COURSE,
IT' S SERIOUS.
I SHALL PROBABLY
CONCEDE THE GAME.
IT'S A ROYAL PREROGATIVE
TO BE UNSPORTING.
NEVER CONCEDE.
I THROW.
BLACK 5 !
THE MATCH, FATHER, WAS OF
YOUR MAKING NOT OF MINE.
EVEN So,
AS A DUTIFUL SON,
I JOURNEYED FAR
BEYOND OUR BORDERS
TO PAY MY RESPECTS
TO THE LADY AND...
SEE FOR MYSELF.
AND SHE WAS FAIR,
WAS SHE NOT?
INDEED, SIR. PERHAPS
PALE RATHER THAN FAIR.
A SICKLY LADY, SIR,
GIVEN TO MUCH SWOONING
AND... AND VAPORS.
ALL LADIES SWOON. THEY KNOW
IT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.
SOME SWOON
MORE THAN OTHERS, SIR,
AND SWOONING TO EXCESS IS NOT
A QUALITY I GREATLY ADMIRE.
SHE REFUSED YOU? IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
No, FATHER,
SHE COULD NOT REFUSE ME
BECAUSE I DID NOT OFFER.
YOU PERHAPS PLACED
TOO MUCH TRUST
IN THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS
OF CAROLSFELD.
THE LIKENESS
WAS No LIKENESS.
INDEED, SINCE YOU FORCE ME
TO THE DISCOURTESY,
THE LADY WAS BALD, SIR.
HER GOLDEN TRESSES FALSE!
HER MOUTH CRABBED WITH AGE, SIR,
AND DEVOID OF TEETH!
IN SHORT, SIR, SHE LEFT
MUCH TO BE DESIRED.
EXTRAORDINARY '.
FATHER,
IT'S A SMALL THING
AND DOUBTLESS
VERY IRRITATING TO YOU
BUT WHEN I MARRY,
AS NEEDS I MUST ONE DAY,
IT WILL BE FOR THE
CONVENIENCE OF LOVE,
RATHER THAN THE CONVENIENCE
OF... CONVENIENCE.
LOVE?
DID HE SAY LOVE?
HA HA!
HOW ABSURD.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
WHY SHOULD LOVE ENTER
INTO IT AT ALL?
LOVE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE EMOTIONALLY
HARRIED WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED
IT'S PEDANTIC
AND ROMANTIC FOLDEROL
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
PRINCESS SUSAN
PRINCESS KAREN
PRINCESS KATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
I DISAGREE.
YOU DISAGREE?
HOW CAN YOU
DISAGREE, DEAR?
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT US.
Us, HA HA!
LOOK AT us.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO
DO WITH BEING MARRIED?
BEING MARRIED IS
A PROBLEM ALL ITS OWN
LOVE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED AND
MAKES MARRIAGE COMPLICATED
WHEN THE BED IS
ELEVATED TO THE THRONE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
PICK THE PROPER PRINCESS
PRIMIED TO PROPAGATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
THERE IS MANY
AN ELIGIBLE MAIDEN
OF GOOD FAMILY
WITH TITLE OF HER OWN
WHO WOULD COME TO US
BOUNTIFULLY BELADEN
WITH AN ARMY THAT COULD
FORTIFY OUR THRONE
UNCLE!
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID
THAT BETTER MYSELF.
WELL, I COULD,
AND IN FACT,
I THINK I WILL.
WHAT HAS MARRIAGE GOT TO DO
WITH BEING HAPPY?
BEING MARRIED CAN'T COMPARE
WITH BEING ROYAL
BEING ROYAL YOU ENGENDER
EVERY LUXURY AND SPLENDOR
WHILE A MARRIAGE
CAN GET OVERRIPE AND SPOIL
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE
WHY PROCRASTINATE
UH-UH!
T AND STAY THE HAND OF FATE? T
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE
HAPPINESS
CAN ALWAYS WAIT
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
GET HIM OUT.
OH, HAVE I MADE
A LITTLE FAUX PAS?
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF.
THERE, YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PRICE
THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY
UNLESS YOU NAME
THE DAY.
LISTEN, LEND AN EAR.
I SAY AGAIN...
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
Queen: WHAT HAS BREAD
GOT TO DO WITH WEDDING CAKE?
WE ARE BORED WITH YOUR
DEFIANCE OF CONNUBIAL ALLIANCE
FOR A LINE OF ROYAL GIANTS
IS AT STAKE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
WE ARE GROWING OLD
AND TIME IS GROWING LATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

NOT TO STAY A CELIBATE

WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
WE ARE NOT PREPARED
TO SAY.
Woman: OH, WHAT A RELIEF
THAT IS OVER
AND DONE WITH.
HELP ME, MY DARLINGS. MY
FINGERS ARE POSITIVELY NUMB.
Girl: MAMA, DIDN'T
YOU THINK THE VICAR WAS--
Woman: GIRLS,
GIRLS, GIRLS.
CAN YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT SQUABBLING?
BLACK WAS NEVER
MY COLOR.
Girl :
So UNBECOMING.
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S
So YOUNG AND PRETTY.
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING, CHILD?
TO MY ROOM,
STEPMOTHER.
YOUR ROOM?
Girls : HER ROOM!
Stepmother: ALL THE ROOMS
IN THIS HOUSE ARE MINE NOW.
YOUR FATHER,
M'! LATE HUSBAND,
SADLY MISSED BY
US ALL,
IS DEAD, CHILD.
DEAD AND BURIED
BENEATH THE SNOW
IN THE SAME GRAVE
AS YOUR DEAR MOTHER.
THAT IS A DOUBLE MISFORTUNE
FOR YOU.
AND NOW YOU MUST START
A NEW LIFE.
YOUR FATHER, AS A TOKEN OF
HIS GREAT LOVE FOR ME,
SAW FIT TO MAKE A WILL
PLACING YOU IN MY CARE
AND PROTECTION.
MY FATHER
NEVER LOVED YOU.
YOU TRICKED HIM.
HOW DARE YOU, MADAM!
YOU TRICKED HIM!
WELL...
WELL IF I DID,
HE DID NOT LIVE
TO RUE THE DAY, DID HE?
AND NOW YOU CAN CURB
YOUR TONGUE;
CULTIVATE HUMILITY,
KNOW YOUR PRESENT PLACE.
I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU ALL.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME, GIRL,
AND HEAR ME WELL!
BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN A WIDOWS TEARS,
AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SHED
ENOUGH OF THOSE.
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
OF MY OWN TO SUPPORT,
WHICH SITUATION
HAS FORCED ME
TO MAKE CERTAIN ECONOMIES
IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
IS THAT NOT SO, GIRLS?
YES, MAMA.
CERTAIN DRASTIC
ECONOMIES, MAMA.
EXACTLY.
BUT BEING A WOMAN
OF PRINCIPLE,
I SHALL HONOR YOUR
FATHER'S LAST WISHES
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD
BELOW STAIRS!
AND DO NOT THINK YOU WILL
FIND SYMPATHY WITH THE STAFF.
THE STAFF
HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.
YOU ARE NOW THE STAFF.
TO TAKE ORDERS
INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM.
MOSTLY FROM US.
NEVER.
OH, YES.
YOU WILL COOK
AND YOU WILL CARRY.
YOU WILL FETCH
AND YOU WILL MEND.
YOUR FATHER'S WILL
ALLOWS AND THE LAW UPHOLDS.
So, TAKE YOUR PICK,
EITHER ACCEPT
YOUR LOT
OR Go TO
THE ORPHANAGE.

Stepsister: OH, MAMA,

MY DARLINGS...
EVERYTHING WILL BE FAIRLY
DIVIDED. NOW, COME ALONG.
I'M THE ELDEST, AND I

AND THIEVES WE KNOW
MUST BE PUNISHED.
COME !
THIS IS YOUR PLACE,
AND THERE
IS YOUR TASK.
WE ARE EXPECTING GUESTS
FOR DINNER TONIGHT...
IMPORTANT GUESTS.
AND FOR REPAYING MY KINDNESS
WITH CUNNING AND DECEIT,
HENCEFORTH, YOU WILL NOT DARE
TO VENTURE FROM THIS ROOM
WITHOUT MY SAYING.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
YES, STEPMOTHER.
THEN MAKE A START
AND MAKE AMENDS.
Prince: JOHN,
TELL ME SOMETHING.
HAVE YOU EVER WISHED
YOU WERE IN LOVE?
OH, YES.
OFTEN? I MEAN,
AS OFTEN AS I WISH IT?
WELL...
WELL, I AM IN LOVE.
YOU ARE? HOW AMAZING.
WHO IS SHE?
THE LADY CAROLINE,
SIR, SINCE YOU ASK.
WHAT? THE LADY-IN-WAITING
TO MY GRANDMOTHER?
THAT LADY CAROLINE?
YES.
HOW AMAZING!
WM.
WELL, IT' S EXTRAORDINARY.
NOT EXTRAORDINARILY
EXTRAORDINARY, OF COURSE,
BUT I NEVER GUESSED.
HEH, HEH. I KNOW.
WELL, I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU HAVE M'! BLESSING.
I - I - I MUST
CONGRATULATE HER.
No! No, PLEASE, SIR.
DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S KIND OF YOU, BUT
IT WOULDN'T BE SEEMLY.
HOW SO?
ALAS, MY CAUSE
IS A LOST ONE.
WELL, THE LADY DOES NOT
RETURN YOUR AFFECTIONS?
OH, INDEED! BUT THE FACT
REMAINS THAT I AM WHAT I AM:
A SERVANT!
POSITIOH, SIR.
POSITION.
JOHN, I'M TWICE AMAZED.
I MUST BE VERY DENSE.
AM I?
OF COURSE NOT. YOU
HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS;
I HAVE MINE.
King: WHERE ARE WE?
THAT's US?
YOU'RE SURE THIS MAP'S
BEEN DRAWN TO SCALE?
I BELIEVE SO,
YOUR MAJESTY.
THEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN
LOOKING AT ALL THESE YEARS?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS US.
I ALWAYS GO BY
THE BROWN PARTS FOR THE LAND
AND THE BLUE PARTS
FOR THE SEA.
WHO'S THAT?
FIRST LORD OF
THE NAVY, SIRE.
HAVE WE GOT A NAVY?
THE ROYAL BARGE
ON THE LAKE?
OH, YES, YES.
WELL, REMIND ME NOT
TO TRAVEL IN IT AGAIN.
King: SO, EVEN ALLOWING FOR
ERRORS IN THE CARTOGRAPHER'S ART,
WE ARE SMALL IN COMPARISON
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.
THOUGH GREAT IN, AHH,
WHAT'S THE WORD?
ER, TRADITION?
TRADITIOH, YES. GREAT
IN TRADITION AND SPIRIT,
IN FACT, WE ARE SMALL.
HEAR, HEAR.
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN!
NOW, YOU'RE ALL AWARE
OF THE PROBLEMS
OF MY SON'S RELUCTANCE TO
HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD WIFE
CHOSEN FOR HIM.
THIS GENERATION HAS
No RESPECT AT ALL.
I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED OFF
BEFORE I WAS 14!
CAROLSFELD - -WHERE'S THAT?
AH, YOU SEE, THE SIZE OF IT,
SEE THE SIZE OF IT. PERFECT.
NOW, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?
WITH RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,
I HAVE PREPARED
A SMALL PAPER.
WHAT I AM SEEKING
IS A PROPER BALANCE,
WEIGHING
WHAT WE SACK
AGAINST WHAT
WE HAVE TO OFFER.
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES, STOP TALKING
IN THOSE BORING, DIPLOMATIC RIDDLES.
SPEAK THE KING'S
EUPHRANIAN, MAN!
FORGIVE ME, YOUR MAJESTY.
I HAD IN MIND A CELEBRATION.
King: WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO CELEBRATE?
A MARRIAGE, SIRE.
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?
HMM. FINALLY
GOT RID OF HER, EH?
WELL, NOT MY MARRIAGE, SIRE.
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE PRINCE EDWARD'S.
WELL, WE'D ALL LIKE
TO CELEBRATE THAT.
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M
SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF IDIOTS.
HERE WE ARE, HEDGED
IN BY HOSTILE FORCES,
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THOUGHT OF.
SIRE, THIS TIME,
I HAVE A NEW IDEA,
AN IDEA THAT THE PRINCE HIMSELF
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST!
WELL, MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S GOT TEETH.
HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION
ABOUT THEM HAVING TEETH.
I THOUGHT, A BALL!
A BALL?
A GREAT BALL !
THE GREATEST BALL THAT
HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN, SIRE.
AND TO IT, WE WILL INVITE EVERY
ELIGIBLE PRINCESS IN EUROPE,
AND EVEN BEYOND,
YOUR MAJESTY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT IDEA?
I REMEMBER MY FIRST BALL.
YES, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO Go
INTO THE REALMS OE FANTASY.
WHAT ELSE?
I HAVE PREPARED A LIST, your: MAJESTY,
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAKE SUCH PREPARATIONS
AS WOULD DAZZLE
OUR ENEMIES AND DMDE THEM,
FOR PROTOCOL WOULD NOT
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE WAR
WHILE THEY ARE GUESTS
IN OUR MIDST.
AND I REMAIN CONVINCED
THAT THE PRINCE, YOUR SON,
WILL DO HIS DUTY.
INDEED, FACE TO FACE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE ENTIRE COURT
HE COULD HARDLY FAIL
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.
General: THE OCCASION,
THE MUSIC, THE CANDLELIGHT,
THE SWIRLING DRESSES,
THE PERFUME,
THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE!
PUT HIM ON
THE RETIREMENT LIST.
I SHALL MAKE
A ROYAL DECISION!
TAKING THIS IDEA
AND IMPROVING ON IT,
WE MUST PLAN EVERY DETAIL.
NOBLESSE OBLIGE!
Chamberlain:
QUITE SO, YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIPLOMACY.
PROTOCOL!
YES, WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS WE RESPECT
MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
SIRE! PLEASE, SIRE.
WHEN ITS ARMY IS
BATTERED AND BROKEN
AND BACK TO ITS
BORDERS IT CRAWLS
TO WHAT CLINGS
A TOTTERING KINGDOM
IF NOT TO ITS PROTOCOLS?
AND WHEN THE TREASURY'S
TAPPED OF ITS TREASURES
ARE THE TAPESTRIES
STRIPPED FROM THE WALLS?
No, THE COURT CARRIES ON
WITH ITS PLEASURES
INQUISITIONS
AND BANQUETS AND BALLS
All: BUT THEY MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
HO, HO,
WELL-DONE, SIRE.
PRECEDENT!
WE NEED A BOOK THAT WILL
GIVE US CHAPTER AND VERSE.
IN THE LIBRARY--
IT'LL BE IN THE LIBRARY.
I BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY WITHIN
THE LIBRARY, YOUR MAJESTY.
WELL, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.
I KNEW THAT !
WHAT VOLUME
DO YOU SUGGEST?
THERE IS ONLY ONE,
YOUR MAJESTY, THE BIBLE.
BIBLE?! WELL, LET'S KEEP
RELIGION OUT OF IT.
NO, SIRE. I SHOULD
SAY IN THIS CASE,
THE BIBLE IS FORMS
AND ADDRESSES
FOR ROYAL OCCASIONS
B'! DE LYON.
AH.
NOW THEN,
LET ME SEE, SIRE...
ABDICATIONS,
DISMISSAL OF MINISTERS,
GARDEN PARTIES,
INVESTITURES...
JUDICIAL BEHEADINGS"
YES, SKIP ALL THAT.
YOUR MAJESTY, QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT PERTAINING
TO THE SEATING
OF CROWNED HEADS
IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.
AHH! WE SHOULD REHEARSE IT!
UH, YOU CAN BE
THE PRINCESS ESMERELDA,
EVER WILLING TO SERVE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
AND YOU THE DUCHESS
OF RAMBOUILLET,
AND YOU THE DAUGHTER OF
THE EMPEROR OF BRATISLAVA,
AND, UH... OH, THE REST OF YOU CAN
SORT IT OUT AMONGST YOURSELVES.
WHAT AN INSPIRED IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
IF THE DAUGHTER OF
THE DUCHESS OF SNARDEN
WERE TO BE SEATED BY
THE COUNTESS OF SNEAD
FOR THIS BREACH
OF DECORUM TO SNARDEN
THE INVASION
OF SNEAD WOULD PROCEED QI
AND SEAT THE HEIRESS
TO THE BARONY OF NEUBURG
BY THE SIDE OF HER
HATED COUSIN GWENN
OH, HOW QUICKLY
THE ARMIES OF NEUBURG
WOULD DEPLOY
TO DESTROY US AGAIN
All: SO WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT

WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
WELL, NOW!
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME?
NO. I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYBODY.
FUNNY. YOU SHOULD
HAVE FELT SOMETHING.
I'M LOSING MY TOUCH.
COULD I COME IN AND REST
BY YOUR FIRE, PLEASE?
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
A LONG WAY.
WELL... I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO ANYBODY OR SEE ANYBODY,
BUT...
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO SHARE MY FIRE...
SUCH AS IT IS,
BUT I'D BE OBLIGED
IF YOU DIDN'T STAY TOO LONG.
PLEASE EXCUSE ME
IF I CARRY ON WORKING,
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH
THESE, AND I'M VERY SLOW.
YES! WELL, THERE ARE MORE WAYS
THAN ONE OF PEELING POTATOES.
THE FIRE SEEMS
TO HAVE CHEERED UP.
I COULD WARM YOU A LITTLE
BROTH IF YOU LIKE.
No, THANK YOU.
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT.
LIVE DOWN HERE on YOUR own, no YOU?
I DO NOW.
YES.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY
THEY WON'T CHANGE AGAIN.
I GET AROUND QUITE A BIT,
YOU KNOW.
MUST BE NICE TO TRAVEL.
YES AND No.
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD SETTLE IN ONE PLACE,
BUT THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME.
I'D LIKE SOMEWHERE COZY,
WITH A DOG TO KEEP ME COMPANY.
I EXPECT YOUR DOG IS
A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU.
MY DOG?
I HAVEN'T GOT A DOG.
ISN'T HE YOURS?
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?
HE CAME IN WHEN I CAME IN.
OH! OH, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU KEEP HIM?
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.
HE'S AN OLD HAND AT THAT.
OHH!
HE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.
OH, I LOVE HIM!
I'M JUST SO AFRAID OF WHAT
MY STEPMOTHER WILL SAY.
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!
THERE SHE IS,
AND I HAVEN'T FINISHED!
I'VE GOT TO HIDE YOU.
WELL, I'LL BE OFF.
I'VE SEEN WHAT I WANT TO SEE.
YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF HIM.
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!
I KNOW! I'LL HIDE
YOU UNDER HERE.
PROMISE NOT
TO MAKE A SOUND.
HAVE YOU BEEN
STRUCK DUMB, GIRL?
OH!
OH!
ANSWER ME WHEN I CALL.
YOU KNOW I HATE HAVING
TO RAISE M'! VOICE.
NOW, I HOPE YOU HAVE
BEEN HARD AT WORK. I...
I SEE.
WELL, UH...
UH, I SEE.
I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE
YOU MORE TO DO NEXT TIME.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT?
King: I WILL NOT HAVE
MY AUTHORITY FLOUTED
IN THIS FASHION.
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CUSTOM
FOR THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
TO TAKE A WIFE IN GOOD TIME.
AND YOU SHOW A STRANGE RELUCTANCE
TO COMPLY WITH TRADITION.
FATHER,
I EMPHATICALLY DISAGREE.
AND I TOTALLY REFUSE TO TAKE PART
IN SUCH AN EMBARRASSING CHARADE.
BUT I'VE DECREED IT!
THEN YOU MUST
UNDECREE IT.
IMPOSSIBLE !
YOU TALK TO HIM.
DEAREST BOY--
OH, MOTHER,
IT'S NO USE TRYING
TO GET ROUND ME
THAT WAY.
THE VERY IDEA
OF GIVING A BALL
AND INVITING A SELECTION
OF TITLED WALLFLOWERS
TO VIE FOR MY HAND
IS UTTERLY REPULSIVE!
DEGRADING
TO ALL CONCERNED.
IN MY DAY,
I NEVER HAD THE CHOICE!
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
ANY DIFFERENTLY, OF COURSE.
YOU TAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.
WELL I AM YOUR FATHER,
AND I AM THE KING!
IT'S LIKE SOME
SORDID BEAUTY CONTEST
WITH ME
AS THE GRAND PRIZE.
SINCE YOU WON'T GO TO MECCA,
MECCA MUST COME TO YOU!
Queen: YOU HAVE TO GET
MARRIED SOMEDAY, DEAR.
BUT NOT IN THIS WAY.
WELL, IT SEEMS PERFECTLY
REASONABLE TO ME.
WE'VE INVITED EVERY ELIGIBLE
PRINCESS IN THE ALMANAC.
AND IT'S A QUESTION OF DUTY!
FATHER, I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED
THAT IT IS MY BOUNDEN DUTY
TO TAKE A WIFE AND ENSURE
THE ROYAL SUCCESSION.
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BE
PARTY TO AND JUDGE A CATTLE SHOW!
WHOEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING?
CAP-CATTLE SHOW!
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WHERE EVERY MAIDEN'S
BOUND TO LAUGH AT ME
THE ROYAL
FATTED CALF
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
THOUGH I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE CHOOSING
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE LOSING
IT'S NAUSEATING,
NAUSEATING!
CAN'T YOU
JUST IMAGINE IT?
HOPE SPRINGS IN ALL
SHORT, FAT, OR TALL
AS THEY PRIMP
AND PREEN AND PRAY
THAT THIS WILL BE
THEIR LUCKY DAY
THERE IS NO AFFAIR
OF WHICH I'M AWARE
MORE GALLING TO BEAR
THAN A BRIDE-FINDING BALL
Montague:
I JUST HEARD THE NEWS!
King: OH,
WHO LET HIM IN?
IS IT TRUE, DEAR UNCLE?
THE TATTLE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVITE A WHOLE NURSERY
OF NUBILE DELICACIES
TO A BALL.
SOME OTHER TIME, NEPHEW.
WE'RE BUSY NOW.
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.
YOU JUST CAN'T, UNCLE.
I MEAN, I REALIZE THAT
I WON'T HAVE FIRST PICK,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
BECAUSE I'M NOT PROUD.
I'M JUST DESPERATE.
WE'RE ALL DESPERATE!
SO IT'S TRUE, THEN!
OH, HOW EXCITING!
NOW, I MUST DECIDE
WHAT TO WEAR.
HIGH HEELS, I THINK, TO
GIVE ME ADDED STATURE.
THE MOMENT YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE,
I SHALL UNLEASH MYSELF.
I'VE ALREADY MADE
MY CHOICE, COUSIN.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
PICK OF THE LOT.
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
YOU CAN'T BE SUCH
A SPOILSPORT! I MEAN...
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WHERE LUSCIOUS LOVELIES
FROM EACH LAND
WILL VIE TO WIN
THE ROYAL HAND
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WITH FRILLS ON TRESSES,
PARTY DRESSES
EVERY MAIDEN EFFERVESCES
GIVING HER BEST
GVING HER ALL
DANCING, GLANCING,
LAUGHING, TEASING
WHIRLING, SWIRLING
TOUCHING, SQUEEZING
THERE'S NO AFFAIR
TO EVER COMPARE
OR THRILL OR ENTHRALL
LIKE A BRIDE-FINDING BALL
Chamberlain: YOUR MAJESTY.
King: WELL, WHAT IS IT?
I BRING GRAVE TIDINGS.
CAROLSFELD HAS MOBILIZED.
THERE IS TALK OF WAR.
WAR?!
WAR?!
WAR.
WAR.
AS YOUR MAJESTY'S
SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE,
IT IS MY SOLEMN DUTY TO ADVISE YOU
THAT THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL.
THE NEWS THAT HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS SAW FIT TO DECLINE
THE HAND OF THE
PRINCESS SELINA IN MARRIAGE,
WAS ILL-RECEIVED.
TRUE.
TRUE.
EDWARD, M'! sou...
I BESEECH YOU NOT AS A
FATHER BUT AS YOUR MONARCH.
RECONSIDER BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
PUT ASIDE YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY LOOKS TO
YOU TO FORM AN ALLIANCE
THROUGH
THE MARRIAGE BED.
AND DO AS I DID WHEN
I TOOK YOUR MOTHER.
I CLOSED MY EYES AND
THOUGHT OF EUPHRANIA.
Chamberlain: BRATISLAVA!
WILDENSTEIN!
NEUBURG !
OH!
OH!
AAH!
UHH!
King: HOW MANY
DOES THAT MAKE?
WELL, YOUR MAJESTY, OF THE
COURIERS WHO RETURNED,
6 HAVE REPORTED
ACCEPTANCES.
IN ADDITIOH, THERE
WERE 5 REFUSALS.
ONE OF THEM COUCHED IN
THE MOST OBSCENE TERMS.
TWO OF THOSE
INVITED WERE DEAD,
AND THE REMAINING 3
COULD NOT BE TRACED.
THAT MAKES 6 OUT OF 16.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A FAIR AVERAGE, DON'T YOU?
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
PERHAPS NOT QUITE
THE BREADTH OF CHOICE
WE AT FIRST ENVISAGED.
WELL, INVITE ALL LOCAL
NOBILITY AS WELL.
WE DON'T WANT
THE PLACE HALF EMPTY.
WE CAN ALWAYS RAISE
THE TAXES TO PAY FOR IT.
IN FACT, I'LL INVENT A NEW TAX,
A TAX ON SNOBBERY.
THEY'LL ALL PAY THAT.
BRILLIANT, YOUR MAJESTY!
BRILLIANT!
DON'T OVER DO IT.
DON'T OVER DO IT.
YOU'LL BE PAYING IT, TOO.
Stepmother: GIRLS! GIRLS!
ISOBELLA! PALATINE!
Isobella and Palatine:
RIGHT HERE, MAMA!
COME QUICKLY!
WHAT IS IT, MAMA?
WONDERFUL NEWS.
WE HAVE RECEIVED A ROYAL
INVITATION TO A BALL
IN HONOR OF HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRINCE!
OH, MAMA, BUT--
NOW, NOW, NOW,
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
YOU MIGHT TEAR IT,
AND I WANT
TO HAVE IT FRAMED.
OH, I THINK
IT'S SO EXCITING,
I SHALL HAVE THE VAPORS!
HOW SHALL I HAVE
MY HAIR?
OH, WHAT SHALL I WEAR?
THERE IS WORK
TO BE DONE.
WE HAVE NOT
A MOMENT TO LOSE.
WHAT CAN WE WEAR?!
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
SOMETHING NEW.
YES. I MEAN, NONE OF MY
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
LET US GO AND SEE.
OH! CAN YOU NEVER DO
A JOB PROPERLY, GIRL?
LOOK AT ALL THAT DIRTY WATER.
YOU HAD BETTER DO
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE AGAIN!
COME, GIRLS!
MAMA I THINK PALATINE
SHOULD WEAR A BROWN DRESS.
Palatine:
YOU SPITEFUL CREATURE!
YOU SHOULD WEAR GREEN
TO MATCH YOUR COMPLEXION.
Isobella: OH, MAMA!
BUT THE PRESTIGE, YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRESTIGE!
IT WILL PUT
EUPHRANIA ON THE MAP.
UH, PIN THERE, IDIOT.
NOT THERE, THERE.
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
FINE, FINE, FINE.
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.
I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.
NOW LEAVE US, PLEASE.
OH, JOHN!
WHAT HAVE
I LET MYSELF IN FOR?
A LITTLE MORE
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE.
AND WHO KNOWS?
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE ONE TO
WHOM YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HEART.
WILL YOU DANCE
WITH YOUR LADY CAROLINE?
ALAS, NOT DONE, SIR.
OH, YES, HOW STUPID OF ME.
I WAS FORGETTING.
NOT IN 20 YEARS!
WE'RE SOLD OUT!
MY CHOICEST BROCADES!
Stepmother: SOLD OUT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU RIDICULOUS MAN?
HOW CAN YOU BE SOLD OUT
WHEN WE HAVE NOT
PURCHASED ANYTHING?
THE BALL, GRACIOUS LADY.
I'D SCARCELY OPENED ME DOORS THIS
MORNING WHEN THEY DESCENDED!
WHO? WHO DESCENDED?
EVERYBODY, MI LADY !
THEY CAME LIKE
THE HERON TO THE POOL,
TAKING EVERYTHING I HAD.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.
YOU, MY GOOD MAN, SHOULD
LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN RIFFRAFF AND PEOPLE
OF CONSEQUENCE, LIKE US.
WHAT SHALL WE DO?
Stepmother:
COACHMAN, DRIVE US HOME.
GIRLS, DO STOP PULLING
THOSE DREADFUL FACES.
I'M IN A BAD ENOUGH
MOOD AS IT IS.
IDIOT!
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
SHE'S SO BEASTLY TO ME!
CINDERELLA!
CINDERELLA! WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL YOU?
COME OVER HERE. I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU TO DO.
TAKE THESE, UNPICK THEM, AND MAKE 3
SPLENDID NEW DRESSES OUT OF THEM.
OH, MAMA, YOU'RE SO CLEVER.
MAKE SURE THEY FIT
TO PERFECTION.
NOW START IMMEDIATELY.
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT
TO LOSE.
BE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN
BEFORE YOU START SEWING.
AND WE'RE TO LOOK
AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE.
AH, WELL, AS PRETTY
AS WE ARE!
WE MUST ALL BE
UTTERLY SPLENDID.
SO RUN ALONG, CHILD.
START AT ONCE!
YES...
UTTERLY... SPLENDID!
BUT ALREADY,
HIS HEART WAS--
OH, HENRIETTA, no STOP GRUMBLING.
HIS HEART WAS
BURNING WITH... LOVE
AS IF IT HAD BEEN LAID
ON RED HOT GOALS!
YOU LIKE THAT?
So DO I.
SIT DOWN, DEAR.
DON'T DO THAT.
AT THIS POINT, SCHEHERAZADE
SAW THE APPROACH OF MORNING
AND FELL SILENT.
AS WELL SHE MIGHT.
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
SET YOUR FRIENDS OFF.
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT FEEDING.
NO REST, NO PEACE.
WELL... SEE IF YOU LIKE THIS.
YOU'LL FALL.
HANSEL, GRETEL...
IS THAT
THE WRONG WAY ROUND?
WHO'S THAT?
OH, IT'S YOU, IS IT?
OH, DON'T WIPE
YOUR PAWS, WILL YOU!
I'VE GOT NOBODY TO HELP
ME CLEAN, YOU KNOW.
I HAVE TO DO ALL MYSELF.
DO YOU REALIZE THAT TIRESOME SCHEHERAZADE
IS BARELY HALFWAY THROUGH HER 1,001 NIGHTS?
I HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER
496 TALES BEFORE SHE'S SAFE.
AND M'! DIARY IS CHOCK-A-BLOCK.
LOOK! WEDNESDAY, A SEA JOURNEY TO
TAKE CARE OF A LITTLE MERMAID.
FRIDAY... OH, THE UGLY
DUCKLING'S DUE TO HATCH.
WELL, I HAVE TO BE
BACK FOR THAT.
OH, DO BE QUIET, HENRIETTA.
I CAN'T THINK!
NOW, WHAT'S THAT?
AH! A NEW KEY CUT
FOR PANDORA' S BOX.
WELL, IT'S ALL VERY WELL
FOR HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN
TO SAY HIS LIFE
IS A FAIRY STORY.
MINE ISN'T.
NOTHING! ONE LONG SLOG!
I CAN DO ALL MANNER OF THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT NEVER ANYTHING FOR MYSELF.
WATCH! YOU'D LIKE A BONE.
SIMPLE. THERE YOU ARE.
LET ME TRY IT FOR MYSELF.
WOULD I LIKE A CUP OF TEA?
YES, I WOULD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW WATCH THIS.
KETTLE, BOIL.
SEE? DISASTER.
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO CINDERELLA?
HOW FUNNY.
I WAS JUST WISHING--
YES. I KNOW.
DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE
A VERY RUDE COMMENT?
THESE ARE HOPELESS.
THEY'RE WORSE
THAN HOPELESS.
I'VE RUINED THEM.
I'M GOING TO GET
INTO SUCH TROUBLE.
NOW, WE DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT.
DRY YOUR TEARS
AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.
HMM. YOU LOOK
HALF-STARVED AND WORN OUT.
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING TO EAT.
I WAS TOO BUSY DOING
THOSE TO COOK ANYTHING.
WHAT'S THAT, THEN?
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?
AND WHERE DID
YOU COME FROM?
I DON' T UNDERSTAND.
NO. WELL, VERY FEW PEOPLE DO.
YOU'RE NOT MEANT
TO UNDERSTAND IT.
YOU'RE MEANT
TO ACCEPT IT GRACIOUSLY.
NOW, LOOK.
I'M A VERY BUSY WOMAN,
AND I SOMETIMES--
SOMETIMES LACK TACT.
THE FIRST THING YOU MUST LEARN IN
LIFE IS NEVER TO GO BY APPEARANCES.
THINGS ARE NEVER QUITE
WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE.
DO EAT UP; THAT'S
ONE OF MY BEST RECIPES.
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.
I'M NOT WHAT I SEEM.
MIND YOU, I DON'T
DRESS THE PART
AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON.
HUMAN NATURE--OH, WELL,
WE WON'T GO INTO WHAT
I THINK OF HUMAN NATURE,
BUT IF I WERE TO Go ABOUT MY
BUSINESS ALL SPARKLE AND GLITTER,
QUITE APART
FROM LOOKING ABSURD"
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT THEY WRITE
IN THOSE STORYBOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
IT'S A MOST UNSUITABLE
COSTUME FOR A GROWN WOMAN--
I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT
THE WORTHY FROM THE UNWORTHY.
DON' T YOU AGREE?
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I'M A... FAIRY GODMOTHER.
HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE.
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK
HOW I GOT INTO IT,
BECAUSE IT'S A LONG STORY.
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE...
AND I SOMETIMES WISH
WE'D NEVER BEEN INVENTED.
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU?
NOT ENOUGH TO GO ROUND,
JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
OF WORK I HAVE TO DO.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
DELICIOUS.
IT'S THE SAUCE, YOU KNOW.
THAT OLD WIZARD MICHELIN
GAVE ME THE SECRET
IN RETURN FOR 3 OF MY MAGIC
KNIVES AND FORKS. WHERE WAS I?
YES! WELL, I HAVE
TO PUT PEOPLE TO THE TEST.
NOW, YOU PASSED THE TEST.
THOSE-THAT UNHOLY TRIO UPSTAIRS
I SIMPLY DIDN'T BOTHER WITH.
NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.
HOWEVER, TO WORK.
BEST THAT YOU CAN DO
IS GET A GOOD NIGHTS REST.
NO'! YOU.
I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.
WM.
AH. LET ME CONCENTRATE.
WHAT ARE THEY WEARING
IN PARIS THESE DAYS?
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH FASHION.
WELL, HAVE YOU GOT
ANY IDEAS?
OH, CONCENTRATE.
CONCENTRATE.
Stepmother: OF COURSE,
IT IS NOT WHAT I AM USED TO,
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE MADE A
REASONABLE JOB OF STITCHING THIS.
Palatine: I'M MAM'SA FAVORITE,
AND SHE PROMISED ME FIRST.
GIRLS, IT IS
TIME TO LEAVE!
WE MUST NOT KEEP
THE PRINCE WAITING.
MAMA, I'VE JUST BEEN
TELLING PALATINE
THAT SHE'S NOT TO
FEEL JEALOUS
IF THE PRINCE ASKS
ME TO DANCE FIRST.
OH, MAMA!
SHH.
CINDERELLA,
STRAIGHTEN THAT HEM.
Palatine: HOW DO
I LOOK, MAMA?
DON'T I LOOK SUPERB?
YOU BOTH LOOK
RAVISHING.
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR
POOR MAMA TO OUTSHINE YOU.
WELL!
COME, LET US DEPART.
CLEAR UP THE MESS IN MY
BEDROOM, CINDERELLA.
I DO NOT WANT TO COME HOME
AND FIND IT ALL UNTIDY.
Cinderella:
HAVE A NICE TIME.
Stepmother: YOU MAY
DEPEND ON THAT!
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
WE LOOK WONDERFUL.
Isabella: WELL, I DO.
Stepmother:
COME, GIRLS.
Man: YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HER SERENE HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS MARIA OF TUSCANY.
THE GRAND DUCHESS SOFIA
ELIZABETH OF DIETRICHSTEIN.
HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
PRINCESS ALEXANDRE.
OH, WHY NOT?
I'LL JUST MAKE TIME.
YES. YES,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
SITTING ALL ALONE FEELING
SORRY FOR OURSELVES, ARE WE?
WELL, THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE, I SUPPOSE,
THOUGH I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR
THESE ROYAL OCCASIONS MYSELF--
TOO FORMAL, AND NOT
ENOUGH TO EAT OR DRINK.
STILL, I DARESAY IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS YOU'D LIKE TO GO.
GO?
ME Go TO THE BALL?
WELL, OF COURSE.
THAT WHAT YOU WERE
WISHING, ISN'T IT?
NOT WISHING,
EXACTLY,
BUT THINKING WHAT
IT MUST BE LIKE.
SAME THING.
NOW, LISTEN. I HAVEN'T GOT
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME,
BECAUSE I'M SIMPLY RUN
OFF MY FEET THESE DAYS--
WHAT A
MISERABLE FIRE.
YOU SHALL Go
TO THE BALL.
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T
STRETCHED EVERYTHING TOO FAR
AND THAT I CAN
MAKE IT WORK.
MY POWERS ARE NOT
UNLIMITED, YOU KNOW.
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.
OH, I HAVE TO
SHARE THEM OUT.
NOW, LET ME THINK.
YES, I CAN BORROW
A BIT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
RIGHT.
NOW.
YOU !
OUTSIDE.
HEY, I SHALL NEED YOU,
So OFF YOU Go.
OH, AND YOU.
TAKE THEM WITH YOU, DOG,
AND SEE IF YOU CAN ROUND UP
A FROG OR A LIZARD.
NOW, THEN, I MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK, THIS,
BUT THEN,
I HAVE BEEN LUCKY.
OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR!
MOST UNSUITABLE
FOR A BALL.
YES.
YES, IT IS.
WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO Go AS YOU ARE.
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
HOW DO YOU DO IT?
WELL, THAT'S
A TRADE SECRET,
BUT IT HELPS
IF YOU DREAM.
IF YOU DREAM...
SUDDENLY
'SUDDENLY IT HAPPENS
AND THE DREAM COMES TRUE
WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY IT HAPPENS
AND YOUR WORLD IS NEW
X MAGICALLY ﬂ
YOU'RE HOLDING
THE GOLDEN PRIZE
MYSTICALLY
YOUR CASTLES
BEGIN TO RISE
SUDDENLY
DIZZILY YOU'RE SPINNING
WITH THE THRILL OF LIFE
SUDDENLY
'THIRSTILY YOU'RE DRINKING IN
YOUR FILL OF LIFE
K BUT SECRETS)! ﬂ
YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S TRUE
AND WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY ﬂ
SUDDENLY
IT HAPPENS TO YOU
CINDERELLA.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I JUST CAN'T
BELIEVE IT!
OH.
MY STEPMOTHER
AND MY STEPSISTERS"
THEY'LL RECOGNIZE ME.
No ONE WILL RECOGNIZE
YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE.
PEOPLE SELDOM DO.
BUT HOW
SHALL I BEHAVE?
I'M DRESSED LIKE
A PRINCESS.
OH, JUST BE
YOURSELF.
AND FOR TONIGHT,
YOU ARE A PRINCESS--
THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.
BUT I MUST
WARN YOU--
AND TAKE HEED, FOR IT
IS A SOLEMN WARNING--
THE MAGIC I HAVE CONJURED HERE
TONIGHT IS BORROWED MAGIC.
ON THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT,
YOU MUST RETURN IT.
OTHERWISE, EVERYTHING
I HAVE TRANSFORMED
WILL CHANGE BACK TO
ITS ORIGINAL STATE.
Chorus: SUDDENLY
DIZZILY YOU'RE SPINNING
WITH THE THRILL OF LIFE
SUDDENLY
THIRSTILY YOU'RE SPINNING WITH
THE THRILL OF LIFE
BUT SECRETLY
YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S TRUE
WHEN
WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY ﬂ
SUDDENLY
IT HAPPENS TO YOU

OFF YOU Go,
AND ENJOY YOURSELF.
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU,
FAIRY GODMOTHER.

SUDDENLY IT HAPPENS
TO YOU
SPLENDID. I ALWAYS
ENJOY A POLONAISE.
AHEM. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.
DOESN'T SPEAK
A WORD OF EUPHRANIAN.
JOHN?
John: MA'AM?
TAKE ME
ON THE FLOOR.
YES. YES, or COURSE.
HOW VERY
INTERESTING.
DO YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
EXCELLENT TEETH.
HA HA!
YOUR MAJESTIES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HER HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS... INCOGNITA.
WHO IS SHE?
WHO CAN SHE BE?
I'VE No IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
SHE'S NOT
ON MY LIST.
YOUR LIST,
YOUR LIST.
YOUR LIST. FIND
OUT, MAN. FIND OUT.
YES, SIR.
I DIDN'T QUITE
CATCH THE NAME.
NO, MOTHER.
NONE OF US DID.
MOST IRREGULAR.
PLAY ON.
PLAY ON.
I THINK...
I THINK I SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY
I'M HERE, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
MY EYES GIVE ME
ENOUGH REASONS.
MY NAME IS EDWARD,
AND IT IS FOR ME TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU,
EXPLAIN WHY
I SUBJECTED YOU
TO THIS
RIDICULOUS CHARADE.
I'M SURE I SEEM TO YOU
THE MASTER OF MY FATE,
BUT UNTIL
THIS MOMENT,
I'VE BEEN A PRISONER
TRAPPED BY MY BIRTHRIGHT.
TRAPPED?
YES.
IT WAS NEVER MY INCLINATION
TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS.
WHAT I MEAN IS...
AND I'M NOT SAYING
IT VERY WELL...
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT MARRIAGE...
SHOULD BEGIN WITH LOVE.
I'M SURE YOU AGREE.
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN
THE MATTER MUCH THOUGHT.
I'M AMAZED YOU EVEN ACCEPTED
THE INVITATION TO THE BALL.
YES.
I WAS A LITTLE
AMAZED MYSELF.
DIDN'T YOU
THINK IT ODD?
I SUPPOSE I DID.
BUT... YOU STILL CAME.
WHY?
MUST YOU
ASK THAT?
YES, I MUST.
I HAD HEARD
MUCH OF YOU.
GOOD OR BAD?
OH, NOTHING
BUT GOOD.
I CAN'T THINK HOW.
IF I WERE YOU, I'D HAVE
BELIEVED THE WORST.
YOU SEE,
I WAS EXPECTING--
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.
BUT WHATEVER
HAPPENS AFTERWARDS,
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER
THIS MOMENT.
AND YOU MUST TAKE MY PRESENT
HAPPINESS TO MAKE YOU HAPPIER.
TAKE IT...
WITH ALL MY HEART,
FOR I GIVE IT WITH
ALL MY HEART.
THERE'S A SECRET KINGDOM
ALL MY OWN
WITH No CASTLES AND No
VASSALS AND NO THRONE
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME
IN MY PRIVATE
MONARCHY
WHERE THE KING IS LOVE
AND LOVE ALONE
IN THAT SECRET
KINGDOM THAT YOU SEE
SHOULD THE MAKE-BELIEVE
BECOME REALITY
WITH No SCEPTER
IN YOUR HAND
No DOMINION
TO COMMAND
WOULD YOU BE CONTENT
WITH ONLY ME?
WHAT IS A SONG
THAT'S NEVER SUNG?
WHAT IS A HEART THAT'S NEVER
THRILLED TO BE YOUNG?
WHAT IS A DREAM THAT
CAN'T COME TRUE?
WHAT IS MY LIFE TO ME
WITHOUT M'! LOVE FOR YOU?
IF THAT SECRET KINGDOM'S
OURS TO SHARE
I COULD NEVER WISH FOR
MORE, FOR YOU'D BE THERE
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME
IN OUR PRIVATE
MONARCHY
ALL ALONE TOGETHER
WE WOULD LOVE FOREVER
IN OUR SECRET KINGDOM
FAR AWAY SOMEWHERE
AHEM.
YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS?
YES? WHAT IS IT?
HIS MAJESTY
REQUESTS AN AUDIENCE
WITH THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.
Edward: PLEASE
TELL MY FATHER
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO
GRANT HIS REQUEST.
YOU FRIGHTENED HER,
YOU FOOL!
WAIT !
COME BACK!
COME BACK.
RAINBOWS RACED
AROUND THE ROOM
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME
SHOOTING STARS
BEGAN TO ZOOM
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME
IN HIS ARMS
I WAS ASCENDING
MY WORLD BECAME
A MAGIC BLENDING
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME
THOUGH THIS LOVELY NIGHT WAS
ONLY A FANTASY
AND I KNOW TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE
DANCING
IN HIS ARMS FOREVER
MY HEART
WILL NEVER BE FREE
'DREAMING OF THE NIGHT

RAINBOWS RACED

AT LAST I SAW
THAT PERFECT BLENDING
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE

ONLY A FANTASY?
COULD IT BE TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE?
DANCING

Stepmother:
CINDERELLA!
WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?
CINDERELLA!
YES, STEPMOTHER?
THERE YOU ARE.
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL?
I WANT A WEAK
INFUSION OF TEA.
MY HEAD IS FIT
FOR CRACKING.
GOOD MORNING,
MAMA.
MORNING, MAMA.
BRING
THE BREAKFAST.
IMMEDIATELY,
CINDERELLA.
I WASN'T ABLE
TO SLEEP.
OH, OH, THE EXCITEMENT
OF LAST NIGHT!
NOT ON THE BED,
MY PRECIOUS.
Palatine: YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN AMAZED.
YOUR STEPSISTERS
WERE A TRIUMPH.
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LATE ARRIVAL
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PRINCESS,
I FEEL SURE THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE MADE
HIS CHOICE BETWEEN MY TWO ANGELS.
WHAT PRINCESS WAS THAT?
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW.
HE SEEMED QUITE
TAKEN WITH HER,
BUT THEN, MEN ALWAYS
Go FOR THE OBVIOUS.
OH, YES.
I MEAN, SHE WAS NOT
THAT PRETTY...
STRIKING, PERHAPS.
Isobella: DON'T
FORGET M'! BREAKFAST.
Stepmother:
BREAKFAST.
THINK, MAMA--
WE WERE ACTUALLY
THERE AT THE CASTLE.
WHERE YOU BELONG,
MY DEAR.
I WONDER WHAT THE
PRINCE IS DOING TODAY?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PRINCE
IS GOING TO DO TODAY.
THE PRINCE IS GOING TO EXERCISE
HIS ROYAL PREROGATIVE FOR ONCE.
King: LEAVE US.
No, STAY. I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS.
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING
TREATED LIKE SOME VILLAGE IDIOT!
King: I'M GLAD YOU
STAYED TO HEAR THAT.
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE
HEIR TO THE THRONE.
FATHER, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TREATS ME LIKE AN IDIOT.
YOU ARRANGE A
BRIDE-FINDING BALL.
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT,
I FALL IN WITH YOUR PLANS.
I PLAY MY PART.
I GREET, I'M POLITE,
I DANCE WITH, I FLATTER,
I CONCEAL MY BOREDOM FROM HALF A DOZEN
TWITTERING MAIDENS OF BLUE BLOOD.
IN SHORT, I FULFILL MY SIDE
OF THE BARGAIN.
TRUE. I CAN 'T
FAULT HIM THERE.
AND THEN, BY SOME MIRACLE, I
FIND THE LADY OF MY CHOICE,
AND WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU FRIGHTEN HER AWAY!
A SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
IS BEING MADE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.
OUR POLICE--
OUR POLICE, FATHER, COULDN'T
FIND A MISSING HAYSTACK,
LET ALONE A NEEDLE.
HOW COULD SHE DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE?
DO WE NOT HAVE FRONTIERS,
CUSTOMS POSTS, GUARDS?
WE HAVE CUSTOMS,
OF COURSE.
VALUABLE SOURCE
OF REVENUE.
AND MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT OUR
POLICEMEN ARE WONDERFUL.
THIS IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY
CLUE WE HAVE, AND I FOUND IT.
IT'S REMARKABLY DAINTY.
EXACTLY.
IT'S UNIQUE...
LIKE ITS VANISHED OWNER.
THEREFORE, WE MUST USE IT.
WHOEVER FITS THE SLIPPER
MUST FIT THE BILL!
HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT!
WHOEVER FITS THIS SLIPPER
SHALL MARRY MY SON!
YOUR MAJESTY, YOU HAVE
SOLVED THE PROBLEM.
QUITE So.
NOW, WE MUST ACT--
UH, YOU MUST ACT.
UM, THIS SLIPPER
MUST BE TAKEN
TO EVERY STRANGER
OF NOTE IN THE LAND.
THIS REALLY IS--
IT REALLY IS
VERY DAINTY.
UM, THE YOUNG LADY
ARRIVED INCOGNITA
BUT MUST OBVIOUSLY BE
OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.
SHE CANNOT REMAIN
UNKNOWN FOREVER.
A PROCLAMATION
IS REQUIRED, SIRE.
YES. DRAFT IT
IMMEDIATELY.
BE IT KNOWN THAT IT IS
OUR ROYAL WILL
TO FIND THE OWNER OF
THIS CHARMING, UH"
HALF THE SIZE
OF YOUR MOTHER'S--
THIS GLASS SLIPPER,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.
YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT WITH YOU.
VERY DISTURBING.
HMM. I'M PROUD
OF YOU, EDWARD.
BY ROYAL COMMAND
OF HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
KNOW THIS--
THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL TRY ON
THIS SLIPPER
AND FIND IT A PERFECT FIT,
THEN, BY ROYAL DECREE,
SHE SHALL BE GIVEN
IN MARRIAGE
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE PRINCE EDWARD OF EUPHRANIA,
HEIR TO THE THRONE.
GOD SAVE THE KING!
PUSH! PUSH!
OH, I AM PUSHING, MAMA!
IT DOESN'T FIT.
LET ME TRY.
OOH...
NOW, PUSH HARD!
Edward:
HAVE YOU FOUND HER?
ANY SIGN OF HER AT ALL?
AND YOU?
AND YOU?
SIR?
HMM?
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.
I KNOW SHE EXISTS.
THE SLIPPER
WILL REMAIN THERE
AS A MONUMENT TO
MY LOST LOVE.
Edward:
HOW ABSURD LIFE IS.
DOWN THERE, EVERYTHING
IS So SIMPLE.
PEOPLE MEET,
FALL IN LOVE,
MARRY,
AND HAVE CHILDREN.
I DARESAY
THEY ENVY ME HERE.
I'M TOLD ENVY OF PRINCES
IS A COMMON ENOUGH THING.
Edward: 3 MONTHS,
6 DAYS, 10 HOURS.
THAT'S HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE LAST I SAW HER.
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS!
YES.
OH, HOW SELFISH OF ME.
FORGIVE ME, JOHN.
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR LADY CAROLINE?
OH, YES...
INFREQUENTLY.
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS.
YOU SEE, SIR, IF MY FATHER
WERE A CHANCELLOR...
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
THE LOVELY
LADY CAROLINE
WOULD BE A PROPER
WIFE, YOU SEE
BUT MY FATHER
WAS A SERVANT
AND MY MOTHER
SAME AS HE
So THE LADY
OF MY CHOOSING
IS A WORLD AWAY
FROM ME

Edward: ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,
BUT I SHALL
PROVE YOU WRONG,
FOR PRINCES,
WHEN CONVINCED,
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR POSITION.
I CAN'T THINK WHY I DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE.
John I ABOUT WHAT?
WAIT, AND ALL
WILL BE REVEALED.
KNEEL.
WHAT? ME?
I COMMAND IT.
I DUB THEE, AS IS MY
PRIVILEGE SO TO DO,
A KNIGHT OF THE ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID.
ARISE, SIR JOHN.
AS A KNIGHT
OF THE REALM,
YOU CAN NOW CLAIM THE HAND
OF THE FAIR LADY CAROLINE--
WHICH IS FORTUNATE
FOR YOU BUT WHICH, ALAS,
LEAVES ME WITHOUT
A COMPANION-AT-ARMS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
UH, WILLOUGHBY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
CAN HE NOT ANSWER
FOR HIMSELF?
IT'S NOT HIS
POSITIOH, YOU SEE.
AH, TRUE.
BUT IT WILL BE.
I SHALL ELEVATE YOU, TOO,
WILLOUGHBY.
FROM HENCEFORTH, YOU ARE MY
PERSONAL COMPANION-AT-ARMS,
WITH ALL THE PRIVILEGES
SUCH OFFICE BESTOWS.
YOU WILL NEED
A SWORD.
HERE.
TAKE MINE.
IT GOES THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.
HELP HIM, WILL YOU?
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD
MORNING'S WORK.
John: CONGRATULATIONS,
WILLOUGHBY.
AND CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, TOO, SIR JOHN.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
NOTHING.
GO AND FIND HER.
BE HAPPY.
HAPPY ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.
I MUST FETCH THE PRINCE.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOU WRETCHED GIRL? YOU...
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
OH!
OH!
I LITTLE KNEW, MADAM, THAT I WOULD
HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING
YOU AND YOUR DELIGHTFUL DAUGHTERS
AGAIN IN SUCH HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES.
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS?
YOU ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN, I
BELIEVE, OF MY WIFE TO BE.
YOUR WIFE TO BE?
WHY, YES. I AM MORE
THAN HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.
I HAVE BEEN A MOTHER TO HER.
THEN I DO RIGHT BY FORMALLY
ASKING YOUR PERMISSION
TO TAKE CINDERELLA'S
HAND IN MARRIAGE.
OH!
OH!
CONTROL YOURSELVES !
PERMISSION? WHY, OF COURSE!
GLADLY! NATURALLY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DO I--
WILL YOU BE QUIET?
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
PLEASE ALLOW ME THE HONOR OF
INVITING YOU INTO
OUR HAPPY HOME.
COME, CINDERELLA, DEAR.
WE WERE So WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
THANK YOU, BUT No, I HAVE OTHER
URGENT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.
IN MY HAPPINESS,
I FORGIVE YOU ALL.
FORGIVE ME?
HOW DARE SHE FORGIVE ME?
AND WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?
CINDERELLA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
A MOST UNUSUAL NAME.
Edward: THE NAME, MOTHER,
IS SURELY OF No IMPORTANCE.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT I'VE MADE MY
CHOICE AND WAIT FOR YOUR BLESSINGS.
YOU GAVE US A LOT OF TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE BALL.
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE. VANISHED, YOU SEE.
DID YOU Go BACK
TO YOUR OWN KINGDOM?
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. I WENT
BACK TO WHERE I LIVE.
AND WHERE IS THAT, CHILD?
WHY, HERE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
HERE? IN THE CASTLE?
No, FATHER. AS YOU'VE OFTEN
REMARKED, LOVE IS BLIND.
AND WE SOMETIMES DON'T LOOK
UNDER OUR NOSES.
CINDERELLA LIVES IN OUR OWN
EUPHRANIA, NOT 20 MILES FROM HERE.
WHO IS THIS GIRL?
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY TELL
ME WHAT IS GOING ON?
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT
EDWARD WANTS TO MARRY.
IS GOING TO
MARRY, FATHER.
I DON'T WISH TO
SEEM OFFENSIVE,
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME
THAT SHE'S MOST UNSUITABLY
DRESSED FOR SUCH A
SOLEMN OCCASION.
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, GRANDMAMA. IT'S
SOMETHING I SHALL CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.
FATHER, BY YOUR LEAVE.
King: QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT.
UNPRECEDENTED
QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENT.
MY OWN THOUGHT,
SIRE.
A MEETING, I THINK.
THE STAFF COUNCIL.
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN
CONVENED, YOUR MAJESTY.
PITY. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.
IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES...
MOST APPEALING.
WHO IS IT?
MILADY, I'M COMMANDED
BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING
TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE.
OH.
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
PLEASE ENTER.
MI LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
MILADY.
FORGIVE ME FOR
DISTURBING YOUR REST...
BUT, ALAS, THERE ARE
SOME MATTERS OF STATE
THAT CANNOT BE DELAYED.
HIS MAJESTY HAS REQUESTED ME,
AS HIS PRINCIPAL MINISTER...
TO BROACH...
A QUESTION OF
SOME DELICACY.
I...
YOU LOVE THE PRINCE EDWARD,
DO YOU NOT?
WHY, OF COURSE.
WHO WOULDN'T?
OH, QUITE SO.
UH, PLEASE. PLEASE.
AND HE HAS EXPRESSED
HIS LOVE FOR YOU
BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT.
YES.
YES, HE HAS.
VERY COMMENDABLY.
BIS MAKES...
OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR.
I'M REALLY TOO OLD
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.
FORGIVE ME,
MY DEAR CHILD, BUT...
DESPITE MY APPEARANCE
AND THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
OF MY HIGH OFFICE...
I AM NOT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUR PLIGHT.
FOR PLIGHT IT IS.
TO BE BLUNT,
BECAUSE THE HOUR IS LATE.
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIS
MAJESTY TO GIVE CONSENT
TO SUCH A MARRIAGE.
NOT POSSIBLE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HMM. WELL...
YOUR LOVE
FOR THE PRINCE
AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU,
WELL, THAT IS A FINE
AND PRIVATE THING.
WOULD THAT IT COULD
REMAIN so,
BUT THE TIMES DEMAND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
THE PRINCE MUST MAKE
A MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE
WITH A PRINCESS
OF THE BLOOD ROYAL.
AND THAT IS WHY
I AM HERE,
BURDENED WITH
THIS UNHAPPY TASK.
YOU SEE,
MY DEAR CHILD,
IN LIFE, LOVE CANNOT
ALWAYS FIND A WAY.
YOU WERE BORN HERE,
SO YOU KNOW THAT
OUR LITTLE KINGDOM,
WHILST FAR FROM PERFECT,
HAS YET ENJOYED COUNTLESS
CENTURIES OF PEACE.
NOW THAT PEACE IS
THREATENED FROM WITHOUT.
THERE ARE SOME WHO LOOK
TOWARDS OUR FRONTIERS
WITH GREEDY EYES.
YOU SEE ONLY LOVE
AND HAPPINESS
STARING YOU IN THE FACE.
I SEE NOTHING BUT WAR
AND DESTRUCTION...
UNLESS A SACRIFICE
IS MADE.
AND THE SACRIFICE...
IS TO BE ME.
YES.
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,
BUT I HAVE TO
ASK IT.
TO LEAVE HIM NOW?
TO LEAVE HIM NOW,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
BUT HE WOULD
SEARCH FOR ME AGAIN.
HE WOULD SEARCH
FOR ME AND FIND ME.
I KNOW HE WOULD.
YES. THAT, TOO,
IS TRUE,
BUT WE'VE ALLOWED
FOR THAT.
IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT WITH PROPER DOWRY
AND EVERY OTHER
CONSIDERATION
FITTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THIS MOST UNHAPPY OCCASION,
IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU BE
TAKEN FROM HERE THIS VERY NIGHT
TO A SECRET PLACE OF EXILE
FAR BEYOND OUR BORDERS.
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
NOTHING, THEN.
I THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING SUCH TIDINGS
WITH TACT
AND UNDERSTANDING.
YOU WERE WELL CHOSEN
FOR THE TASK.
YOUR LADIES-IN-WAITING
WILL BE SENT FOR.
BUT IN BOWING TO
THE ROYAL DEMANDS,
I MUST MAKE ONE
OF MY OWN.
MILADY?
IT IS NOT VERY MUCH
AND SOMETHING
WHICH...
WITH YOUR GREATER EXPERIENCE
IN THESE MATTERS,
YOU WILL NOT FIND
VERY DIFFICULT.
I WISH YOU TO TELL HIS
ROYAL HIGHNESS...
PRINCE EDWARD...
I WISH
YOU'D TELL HIM...
TELL HIM...
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE
SAY I TRIED
SAY I LIED
TELL HIM
I'M UNWORTHY OF
WHAT HE FEELS
INSIDE
TELL HIM THAT
YOU HEARD ME SAY
WHAT SEEMED RIGHT
JUST LAST NIGHT
SIMPLY SEEMED
TO FADE AWAY
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY
TELL HIM OF THE
COUNTLESS OTHER LOVERS
WHOM I TANTALIZED,
VICTIMIZED
TELL HIM OF
THE MANY OTHER TIMES
I'VE PLAYED
THIS HEARTLESS GAME
JUST TEE SAW'.
'TELL HIM
WHAT I REALLY AM
IS JUST A COLD
AND EMPTY SHAM
TELL HIM ANYTHING
BUT NOT
THAT I LOVE HIM
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE
ALL WE SHARED,
ALL WE CARED
MAKE HIM HATE
MY MEMORY
MAKE HIM GLAD HE'S FREE
PAINT ME EVIL,
PAINT ME CRUEL
SAY I BROKE EVERY RULE
MAKE HIM FEEL
THAT HE'S A FOOL
FOR HIS LOVING ME
DON'T LET HIM KNOW
WHY I MUST LEAVE HIM
WHY I MUS GO
SO FAR AWAY
FOR IF HE KNEW
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM
NO POWER ON EARTH
COULD MAKE HIM STAY
YOUR MAJESTY.
THE DEED IS DONE.
SHE CERTAINLY BEHAVED
LIKE A PRINCESS.
Edward: COME ON!
THE FRONTIER!
FATHER.
FATHER, YOU HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
THE SPOILS
ARE YOURS,
BUT IT IS
A SMALL VICTORY.
IF I COULD EXPLAIN...
SPARE ME THAT.
SPARE ME THE FINAL HYPOCRISY
OF YOUR SYMPATHY.
TAKE YOUR MAP.
REARRANGE IT TO YOUR
HEARTS CONTENT.
MAKE YOUR PRECIOUS
MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE.
YOU'VE DESTROYED WHATEVER
VESTIGE OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS
I MIGHT HAVE FOUND,
AND YOU'VE DONE IT IN
THE NAME OF PATRIOTISM.
SO... LET IT BE THUS.
CHOOSE ME A BRIDE
FROM AMONGST THE RAGBAG
OF ROYAL VIRGINS
I HAVE TWICE
REJECTED.
CHOOSE WHO YOU WILL.
I CARE NOT.
I'LL PLAY MY PUBLIC
PART TO THE ALTAR
BUT NO FURTHER.
YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
WILL LIVE WITH YOU
BUT DIE WITH ME.
DEAR CINDERELLA,
FORGIVE ME.
I HAVE NO HEART FOR WHAT
I MUST SHORTLY PERFORM.
MY HEART IS YOURS
AND YOURS ALONE.
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GRIEVE
FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE.
IT'S ONLY IN FAIRY TALES
THAT THE PRINCE...
MARRIES THE LADY
OF HIS CHOICE.
THE REAL WORLD
IS NOT SO KIND.
THERE ARE NO
PRIVATE KINGDOMS"
ONLY PUBLIC ONES.
I HAVE LOVED BUT ONCE.
I HAVE LOVED BUT YOU,
AND I HAVE LOST YOU TWICE.
I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH
THE LOVE WE SHARED
THE DREAM WE DARED
WAS JUST A PRAYER
THAT CAN'T COME TRUE
I TRY TO STOP
REMEMBERING
BUT TILL THE DAY I DIE
WITHIN MY MEMORY
WILL LIVE THE MELODY
OF THE SONG
THAT WAS YOU AND ME
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH
I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU
FOR I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY
AND WHAT, MIGHT I ASK,
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, IT'S YOU.
YOU GAVE ME
SUCH A SHOCK.
I SHOULD HOPE So.
THAT IS NOTHING TO THE SHOCK
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME.
WHY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT
HOW I PLANNED IT.
OH, REALLY!
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD RETIRE.
UNLESS I'M
ON THE SPOT
TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL,
SOMETHING
ALWAYS GOES WRONG.
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU STAYED BEYOND
THE STROKE OF
MIDNIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?
YES. OH, BUT PLEASE
DON'T SCOLD ME.
I'M UNHAPPY ENOUGH
AS IT IS.
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE UNHAPPY.
ANY GIRL
WOULD BE UNHAPPY
IF SHE WERE MISSING
HER OWN WEDDING.
WEDDING?
YES.
THE PRINCE GETS
MARRIED TODAY.
I HAD THE DATE
UNDERLINED IN MY DIARY.
WHY ELSE DO YOU SUPPOSE
I AM DRESSED LIKE THIS?
WHO...
WHO'S HE MARRYING?
WELL, AT THE MOMENT, THE
WRONG GIRL, OBVIOUSLY.
OH, IT'S
TOO IRRITATING.
I HAD IT
ALL MAPPED OUT.
WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHALL SIMPLY
HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION
AND DO SOMETHING
SPECTACULAR YET AGAIN,
AND SPECTACULARS ALWAYS
TAKE So MUCH OUT OF ME.
JUST COME DOWN
OFF THE SWING.
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH SNOW WHITE.
ALL THE SAME,
YOU YOUNG GIRLS.
NEVER DO
AS YOU'RE TOLD.
MEN ARE MUCH EASIER.
OH, MAMA.
YOUR MAJESTY.
SIRE.
AHEM.
SIR.
AHEM !
OH...
King: WHAT CAN I SAY?
THIS Is, UH--
I CAN ASSURE YOU--
Father of bride: YOUR EXCUSE
IS ABSOLUTELY INADEQUATE.
AHH.
IS THE CEREMONY
OVER?
WHAT A RELIEF!
YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS COULD LEAD TO WAR.
I KNOW, I KNOW!
WELL, THINK OF SOMETHING!
HE CANNOT
MARRY HER, SIRE.
THE CONSTITUTION
DOES NOT ALLOW IT.
WELL, DON'T TELL ME.
I WROTE IT.
YES. DON'T TELL HIM.
HE WROTE IT.
I BEG YOUR
PARDOH, MADAM?
AND IF HE WROTE IT,
HE CAN UNWRITE IT.
DON'T YOU AGREE,
YOUR MAJESTY?
HE CAN WRITE
WHAT HE LIKES,
So LONG AS
HE CLEARS THIS ROOM.
THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN IT BY FAR,
MOST OF THEM
NOT WORTH A CANDLE.
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE KING.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I AM!
AND ABSOLUTE MONARCHS
SHOULD ACT ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S VERY BECOMING.
SHE'S RIGHT
WHO IS SHE?
I'VE NO IDEA, SIRE.
SHE MUST BE
ONE OF THE VISITORS.
BUT EVEN IF YOU ALTER THE
CONSTITUTIOH, YOUR MAJESTY,
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF THE OTHER BRIDE.
No, YOU'RE RIGHT. SO WE'RE
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.
IT'S STARING YOU
IN THE FACE.
WHAT IS?
THE ANSWER.
King: WHAT SORT OF
AN ANSWER IS THAT?
Fairy Godmother:
THEY'RE IN LOVE!
THEY ARE?
IT WAS LOVE AT
FIRST SIGHT.
YOU HAVE MY WORD
FOR IT.
ASK HIM.
COUSIN...
COUSIN, IT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO MY NOTICE--
OH, YES. AND TO MINE.
ISN'T SHE RAVISHING?
BUT, UH, AM I
TO UNDERSTAND--
YES... ANYTHING.
Woman: IT REALLY
IS DISGRACEFUL.
WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO AS FATHERS
FACED WITH THIS VERY HUMAN DILEMMA?
IT'S A QUESTION
OF HONOR.
YES. WELL, IT WOULD SEEM IN ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE, UH...
AFAIT ACCOMPLI?
IT'S CERTAINLY
A FATE. HA HA.
THE YOUNGER GENERATION'S
SO FICKLE.
NOT LIKE US,
NO SENSE OF DUTY,
NO SENSE OF HISTORY.
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
I HAD A SWORD IN MY BACK.
YOU, TOO?
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
WE NEVER SHIRKED
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.
SO, WHAT'S IT TO BE?
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER WEDDING.
YES. IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT.
CAN I SPEAK
AS MAN TO MAN?
I'D WELCOME IT.
HE'S, UH, NOT WHAT
I WANTED, BUT, us...
THEN NEITHER
WAS SHE.
OH, CHARMING GIRL!
PLENTY OF SPIRIT.
I'LL ARRANGE EVERYTHING.
MY PLACE, I THINK.
THE SOONER THE BETTER.
YES, THUS CEMENTING
OUR GREAT ALLIANCE.
CONCEAL ING
OUR SHAME.
AMEN.
IN THE NAME
OF THE FATHER,
OF THE SOH, AND
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
AMEN.
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
AND OF THE SON
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
AMEN.
AMEN.

Come on, come on, hurry up.
Here is a watch.
You say, Casey Brown does not pay her own way, right?
Wait, there is more.
Come back here.
Let go off me, mind you.
You hate yourself, knocking cross side.
You creeps.
You lousy creeps.
You saw me after the cups, ha?
Shut up!
But this is her.
Hey!
Let's go!
I packed your things.
She won't need them.
They are not good to me.
Creeps!
You can't get anything on me.
I got an alibi.
I was with three other guys watching TV when it happened.
Big dude!
You think I can't bust out the juvenile hall, ha?
You think I can't?
I can bust any time I want, do you hear?
Any time I want, yeah?
Hey, listen, give me a break, will you?
I mean I am clean, I've never done anything like this in my whole life.
Out!
This ain't no juvenile hall.
Wait for me.
So to the hotel, now what?
You'll take a bath.
What for?
Because I said so, that is what  for.
Don't you even know knock around this place?
It's joker.
Marking zone, just about where you described them.
Yeah.
Where did you get those scars?
Rudolf Valentino beat me because I wouldn't marrry him.
That is the last time you sauce me.
Now where did those scars come from?
I don't remember.
Just keep on not remembering.
Put those on!
Exellent work, Mr. Jenkins,
I'm very pleased.
Good.
Anything else, Mr. Bundage?
No, no.
A dress?
Put it on!
You send me a bill.
Mr. Bundage, our agreement was payment on delivery.
So it was, so it was.
Harry Bundage always honours his agreements.
I'll write you a cheque.
Casey Brown, no parents, no memory of home, apparent age 14, character bellicose, four times in juvenile home and one time committed to correctional facility, oh dear.
And so you know who I am.
And who are you?
My name is Harry Bundage.
My business is finance investments and putting together deals
I'm a businessman.
You are a hustler.
Hey!
A hustler, a cun man,
I can smell them miles away.
You take care of your smell, and don't end out where your ears ought to be.
You're right, my dear, of course.
A man takes the opportunity when he sees it.
You, my girl, are my opportunity, and I'm yours.
Opportunity for what?
Opportunity to become the honourable
Margaret, fourth marchonise of St. Eimen of Candleshoe.
That's you again, age 3 sitting on your mom's lab taken just before your father carried you off.
What did they think happen to her, mother?
She died a year after little
Joe disappeared.
That is the grandmother the best.
Kidnapping made headlines for weeks.
That was taken in Los Angeles ten years ago.
That is the last.
What did they think happen to the kid?
Ooh, she might have survived the crash.
Wandered all somewhere to dispel the shock afterwards, or the father left her somewhere.
She wasn't in the car at all.
Anyway, she was never found.
Which is where I come in, right Harry?
Exactly.
You are the perfect double.
Age is the same, scar is the same, and what else I've got planned.
You'll be able to fool
St. Peter himself.
It sounds perfect.
I got a couple of questions.
Certainly.
Coffee? Thanks.
All right.
Question number one:
It has got to do with a bundle of money, r黦ht, Harry?
You could say that there is that possibility.
Okay. Question number two:
What is in it for me?
For you?
Trip to Europe, luxorious hotel, jet flight into the white blue wonder.
Okay, okay, what is in it hard cash.
Trust Harry Bundage, my dear.
You will be taken care of.
Yeah, that is what I am afraid of.
Now, either we got a deal or we got no deal at all.
What do you mean we got no deal.
Either we got a deal or you can find yourself another look like fourth marchonaise of whatever he is.
I like your style. Pure last me sixteen bloody answers to the pound.
All right.
What kind of a deal you got in mind?
One third of the action.
Damn, you little gutterside...
Remember Harry, you like my style.
...style.
I give you %5.
10. less expenses.
Okay, 10 and a red ferrari.
And a red ferrari? You don't even have a driving licence.
You get the ferrary
I'll get the licence.
It is a deal.
What is our next move?
Our next move is to get out of town quick before Jenkins tries to cash that cheque.
Buckingham Palace, home of the kings and the queens of England.
Royal standarts, that means her magesty must be in his residence with pleasure.
Yeah, I have to give her a ring
Clara!
You are back then.
That is like it
That's her. That is the one.
Hello, deary. You are all right. he?
Oh!
What a savy girl, you got a right one here.
You wasn't born yesterday, was you?
Clara, what do you think?
Will she pass for the Lady Margaret?
She got convinced me all right.
What is that?
That is my cousin.
Miss Clara Grimsworthy, formerly in the service of Candleshoe.
She has got all the answers.
Yeah. Answers to what?
To the questions you have been asking.
Here Clara, fetch it down.
Now then, have you ever read
Treasure Island?
Now, I don't suppose you have with your deprived childhood.
Ain't deprived, I'm delinquent.
There is a difference, you know?
A treasure hunt is what we are about to embark on, but the lady kid's game is the real fame.
And this. This is our Open Sesame.
Crabby piece of paper.
Listen, Miss clever dick, that crabby piece of paper, as you call it, is the last will of testament supposedly lost, of Captain
Joshua St. Edmund, Marquise of Candleshoe.
Now sit down there and listen.
Suppose, I wish to tell you, Captain Joshua was a pirate. A piraveteer, they called it, when he was in the nobility, and that one was damn rascal, one of the best
He brought back enough booty to ransom a Maharaja. and he hid it somewhere in Candleshoe, only no one ain't ever found it.
And one day I comes along.
Who is telling the story, Clara?
Then one day, Clara comes along, she is polishing the bed posts inside Joshua's own room, she found a secret door, behind it is this.
And then when she gets the sack...
I resigned.
When she resigned, she takes the will with her and she brings it to dear cousin Harry.
How do you know it is the real mccoy?
Look at this!
A Spanish doubloon. Just wet the appetite, as you might say.
How much does it worth?
Four thousand dollars.
And there are thousands of them.
So he tells where he hid the gold in the will.
Not likely. And old black villain isn't giving away anything for nothing.
Instead of telling where he's hid the gold, all he does is give us the first clue.
And that is why we want someone in Candleshoe.
Free to follow up the other clues one by one.
And that someone is you.
Yeah. providing we can convince your old dame I am the long lost what's her name.
We'll convince her all right.
By the time we finish with you, my girl, you'll think like that kid, you will feel like her, you'll behave like her.
When the old lady believed that you are the long lost grandaughter, you'll believe it yourself.
Play her the tune, Clara.
Hear them?
What is it?
That part is your passport to
Candleshoe.
Kidneys and liver, you can't eat them.
You also do not like spinach, cabbage and boiled fish.
Who does?
You do like bananas, short bread and rice pudding.
Rice pudding?
You adore it.
And you can't eat strawberries.
They bring you out in a rash.
Check.
Dear Lady St. Edmund,
I'm writing to you on a personal and confidential matter.
Recently, I was in the city of
Los Angeles.
You had two stuffed animals.
And you call them Teddy and
Piggy Wig.
I think I am going to throw up.
Teddy and Piggy Wig!
Teddy and Piggy Wig!
And your mother's favourite scent was lilac.
I shall await your reply.
Respectfully Yours.
Harold W. Bundage
Esquire.
Dear Lady St. Edmund,
Dear Mr. Bundage,
I am writing to you. You are not the first person who claimed to have discovered my granddaughter.
And I daresay you will not be the last.
However, if you care to bring the child to Candleshoe next Tuesday,
I'm perfectly willing to meet her.
The dame seems to be eager. Just let it drop out all the things you remember.
Feel you've seen the old lady before with all that seems familiar, and then hint the secret hiding place.
All right, Harry.
Now as soon as you settled in, you start looking for the second clue straight off.
And do you remember the first one?
Yeah.
For the sunrise student there is treasure among the books.
Don't you memorise it?
For the sunrise student there is treasure among the books, Okay?
Now what I figure is that the second clue should be somewhere in the library
Yeah. Where in the library?
You stupid little nit, if I knew where,
I wouldn't be sending you look for it, Would I?
You just have to go through every book to find it.
Oh, me?
There it is, Candleshoe.
What a shack!
Remember, you like banana, short bread and rice pudding.
And I hate liver, spinach,and boiled fish, relax, Harry.
Right.
Right.
Harry, Harold W. Bundage to see the lady St. Edmund by appointment,
Yes, ladyship is expecting you, sir.
Your hat, sir.
If you wait here for a moment,
I'll tell her ladyship you've arrived.
Ah, there he is.
Captain Joshua St. Edmund himself.
What if he was clever with his gold and his clues?
But he didn't know he was coming up against Harry Bundage.
We'll see who comes out on top, you know me.
You step this way, her ladyship will see you now.
Be careful for your step, sir.
Four hundred years polishing, it is a trifling slippery.
You ought to have a warning.
Yes, sir. Thank you, it will be suggested to her ladyship.
Mr. Bundage, my lady.
How do you do Mr. Bundage?
Charmed, I'm sure.
This is Miss Brown, Miss
Casey Brown.
Hi.
How do you do?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Thank you, indeed.
Vow, what did you get out here?
How many rooms?
I haven't counted them.
Would you serve the tea, please,
Priory?
Tea, Mr. Bundage?
Oh, yes, please.
How do you like it?
Milk, please, and two teeny meeny lumps.
Two teeny meeny lumps.
Miss Brown?
Oh, you got a cherry cola?
I'm afraid not, my lady.
A glass of lemonade, perhaps.
Eh, right, lemonade would be fine.
Now, then, Mr. Bundage?
Ah, well, my lady, I'm a private investigator. I was engaged to a case of fifteen year old girl who ran away from her aptolis angelis. And quite by chance I came across a dossier of this little girl. She has a scar on her forehead and another on her shoulder.
I understand your little granddaughter injured her head when she fell off a pony and tore her shoulder one some barbed wire.
Thanks.
So you brought her to me. I wonder why? There is no reward, you know.
It would be sufficient reward for me your ladyship to know that I restored your long lost daughter to you.
Yes, now, child, let me look at you.
Your spectacles, my lady.
Oh, thank you, Priory.
I've, what is called, "failing eyesight".
Is there something wrong?
No, no, everything is fine.
Do you get some strawberries, Miss?
Yeah, I love them. But I can't eat them.
I break out the hides all over the place.
I always have.
I will have one of those cookies, though.
A piece of short bread perhaps?
Oh, that's what it is.
Well, I've never had any, but I'll try anything once, right?
Mr. Bundage said that you were four years old when you were found.
Do you remember your parents?
No.
That stuff is not bad.
What is that, Priory?
Oh, I beg your pardon, my lady. I thought perhaps Miss Brown cannot eat strawberry, she might care for per condie
That looks like rice pudding.
San齬齧, 鰕le.
What do you know? I'm crazy about this stuff.
Even at home I couldn't get enough of it, all the other kids used to hate it.
Have you got a spoon?
Yes, of course, Miss.
Priory, I think, we could do with some hot water.
Very good, my lady.
Excuse me for a moment.
Priory!
Yes, my lady.
Ah.
Eat it.
I can't, I had enough.
Strawberries, short bread and rice pudding.
That is rather unscrupulous of you, Priory.
You are quite right, my lady.
Most unscrupulous.
You just let things take their course, shall we, Priory.
Uh, uh, delicious.
More tea, Mr. Bundage?
No, thank you, your ladyship,
I'm quite content.
Why do you keep staring at my fireplace?
Oh, I don't know, I guess I must have seen another one just like it some place before, except what I saw had a kind of hole in it.
A hole?
Yeah, I used to hide things there.
Ah, well. It must have been a movie
I saw in a TV show.
Listen. I got to say this, you seem like a really nice old lady and everything, but I ain't your granddaughter.
What makes you say that?
Oh, I don't know, I just know it,
I mean, I have never seen you before in my life.
All right. The truth is this guy over here comes to me and he says, he thought that I was that little girl, the other one got lost, and he says, he has got to bring me to England to see you.
I figured why not. You know, ride on a plane, get to going fancy hotels.
What if I get to lose. But that is all there is to it.
I see.
Yeah, sorry, put you down anything.
Yes, we better split, ha?
I myself am awfully sorry, ladyship. I wished you had been convinced.
Thanks for the lemonade and rice pudding, ha.
See you.
Bye bye.
Ah?
You did that on purpose. You rotten little scump. You deliberately shut the whole thing, straight at the start...
Priory?
Is there a loose brick in the fireplace?
Loose brick, he? I don't think so.
How very odd!
Stay cool, Harry, relax.
Cool, relax? When I think of the money I spent, fares, expenditures and what I paid to bloodsucker Jenkins.
You gave him a bum cheque, you probably stiffed the hotel, too.
Oh, you wake like a jewel.
Harry!
Mr. Bundage!
Mr. Bundage, Mr. Bundage!
What is that?
Mr. Bundage, Her ladyship says, would you step inside again for a moment.
You and the young lady.
Why, certainly, I'd be glad to.
Soon after you left, we examined the fireplace. There was a loose stone.
Are you kidding?
And there was something hidden in the cavity behind it.
Do you recognise this?
A box. No, I don't think so.
Look carefully, dear. Are you sure you have never seen it? It's very important.
No.
No.
Although...
I don't understand.
Oh, my dear!
Oh, my dear!
Welcome to Candleshoe!
Welcome to Candleshoe!
Welcome to Candleshoe!
She did it!
She bloody did!
Would you be so kind, Mr. Bundage, to go to town and return to the child's things.
I would be most impressive. She wouldn't even let her leave. She wouldn't let her even come back to get her bleeding clothes.
Oh, Harry, Harry!
Clara!
We are in.
We are in.
Come in.
I put these away, but they belong in here now.
Teddy and Piggy Wig.
Well, I called them
Teddy and Piggy Wig?
That what you called them when you were a little.
What odd!
But only...
Yes.
I know, just a, it seems to me she smelled like lilacs.
That was your mother's favourite scent.
Oh.
Good night, dear.
Yeah, night.
Sleep well.
Dining room, great hall.
Drawing room.
Library.
You just have to go through every book that you find it.
It has got to be a million of them.
Where there is Will there is a Way.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Search and you will find.
Hi. Who are you?
I'm Cluny, you've missed the breakfast. Mr. Priory send me to find you.
Check.
Here she is.
Hi.
Good Morning, Miss Margaret, how about some breakfast?
Bobby, go and get fresh part of marmalade.
Come and meet the rest of the family,
Miss Margaret.
Ah, Listen, if you don't mind, my name is Casey, ha?
If you prefer it...
Cluny, you already met.
Yeah, right, I met Cluny.
Over here, struggling with the churn, is Peter.
Hi. Hello, welcome to Candleshoe.
This is Anna.
Hey, somebody catch.
Hey, well held.
The acrobatic member of the family is Bobby.
Now, what about breakfast?
Oh, no, look, this will do.
Are you sure?
Yeah, positive.
Anna, give her a glass of milk.
Come on Bobby, help me with the seperator.
When you finished that, you can help making the beds, okay?
You got to be kidding.
Margaret,
Margaret, my dear.
Her ladyship?
She is not coming in here.
I hope not.
Casey, go and see what she wants?
Quick!
Hi.
Ohoo, there you are.
Good Morning.
Are you calling me?
Yes, I was actually, I wondered if you liked to take a little walk with me.
Oh, bother.
Priory!
Oh, there you are, my dearies.
Good morning.
Hello, grandmother.
Anna, I see you met your new friend.
Yes, grandmother, in the kitchen.
Anna, would you go and find Priory for me, please.
Yes, grandmother.
Grandmother, now that your real grand daughter is here, would you send us away.
Good gracious! If I did that, whom would I find slide up and down the great hall?
Splendid!
Yes, my lady?
Priory, I seem to have mislaid my spectacles again.
Will you keep an eye out for them.
Of course, my lady.
And Priory, fetch me a stale bread,
I am taking Miss Margaret for a stroll around at Candleshoe.
Very good, my lady.
Priory!
My lady.
Where are the fresh roses I ordered for the hall table.
I'm sorry, my lady, it is Mr. Gipping, he is one of the cranky moods again.
He woouldn't let me in his garden.
What a cheek. Indeed!
It is not his garden, it's my garden.
And so I shall tell him immediately.
Now, oh, my lady, he will be having his cup of tea.
Oh, good heavens, come on, quick.
Hey, what is going on?
Don't tell her. She has to know.
Not now. Come on.
Tell me what?
This place is a nut house.
Gipping, where are you?
Gipping!
Ah, there you are.
Gipping!
I wish to speak to you.
Gipping, when I order roses for the house,
I pick the cat roses, is that clear?
All you need is orders, you see? If I meet your orders, your flowers come bust.
Oh, do they, indeed?
You used to be a good, pleasant gardener, but in recent year you become fairly tiresome and crotchety.
So that is the way, is it?
Crotchety, am I?
If I am known to be associated with such a character, I do wash my hands and put on my sunday best
Gipping, we are discussing roses.
Go about a lot to work, and be subjected to insults.
You get wind up drawers about nothing.
Mr. Gipping!
You are patrion old woman, now ten more roses I'll see you fat.
Your roses?
Very well.
If that is your attitude you are dismissed.
Priory!
Priory!
Quick!
Help.
Get the boots, get the boots.
Priory!
Oh.
Priory!
P齭st, p齭st.
Yes, my lady.
I have dismissed Gipping. I wish him packed and out of here by this evening.
I see. You wouldn't care to reconsider the matter, I suppose?
Certainly not.
He was impertinent.
That is just his way, my lady. And he would be very hard for me to replace.
He would?
Very hard.
And I'd make sure that you had fresh roses for the hall every morning.
You would.
Well, perhaps I might give him one more chance.
But you may tell him that this is positively his last.
Oh, my lady, the stale bread.
Oh, thank you, Priory.
Oh, Margaret, my dear, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.
Oh, that is okay with me. I don't mind at all.
Good.
I tell you what I think.
I think she is no more lady the grand than a postman
She is here for a purpose.
And it is up to us to discover what it is.
These kids back at the house?
They were lady too?
No, not really, they were of children's home just outside the village.
That was terribly crowded and I had so much room here, so they agreed to let them stay with me. Somehow we've become a family.
Lovely, isn't it?
Yeah.
Never seen anything like it.
What is that over there?
That is the boundary of Candleshoe.
I don't suppose your experience of family life has been a happy one.
What family life?
I tell you, the only thing I remember about family life is nothing, zero.
One forstamped to another
I mean, who wants to care about the the kids to take an inch for welfare money and food stuffs?
I mean, who really cares?
Rackets just like everything else.
Who worries the rackets.
First thing I ever learned is to know in the morning to duke something, ha?
Get him up, first punch is yours.
I see.
Yeah,  well.
Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
But you can't go through life alone.
I ain't alone.
I got me.
Listen, if you don't hand it out, you don't have to worry about not getting to pack.
"For the sunrise student there is trasure among books..."
"For the sunrise student there is trasure among..."
Aah, who is it? Yeah. Come on in.
It's me. Are you awake?
Yeah, I think I am.
How come, you are not in bed.
I got something for you.
What is that?
Garlic.
Garlic?
Garlic keeps ghosts away.
Garlic keeps everyone away.
Thanks, kid, but I don't believe in ghosts.
Not even the ghost of Captain Joshua?
His boots creaking on the corridore in search of his hidden treasure. His sword tap, tap ,tap on the panelling of his death.
Please, have garlic.
Thanks, kid.
I like you.
Yeah, I like you, too.
And now beat it
Good night.
Good night.
Hey, kid, everyone else in bed?
Except me, good night.
Good night.
There has got to be a million, like a needle in a haystack.
What on earth are you doing here?
I was trying to find a book to read.
In the dark?
I couldn't find the light switch.
Oh, oh, you get me a fright. I thought you were an intruder.
I gave you a fright.
I took the short cut. The house is full of secret passages.
I came to find a book, too.
On plumming.
Isn't the gardener any good at plumming?
Gardener isn't much good at gardening.
I suppose you are wondering why.
You probably don't know. You'll find out soon enough anyway.
There is no other staff because we can't afford to pay their wages.
You kidding?
I'm afraid, not.
The old lady, I mean, grandmother, she doesn't know you're broke?
We're not completely broke. Just a little near the edge. We take in some tours.
Tours?
Yes, we open the house to the public one day a week and then we sell eggs, fruit, cakes, jam, that sort of things at the village market. Usually we stay just ahead of the rates and taxes.
This big house, there must be a lot of junk you could sell.
Those having real value went years ago.
That picture, one of the old copies, one or two junk doesn't worth anything.
Well. Now that you know all our secrets,
I hope you keep them.
Why not?
Good. That really makes you one of the family.
You were looking for a book, ha?
Yeah, yeah.
So is I.
Where did I put?
Plummers help?
Plummers help?
Last month the roof started to leak rise the water tank.
Find what were you looking for?
Ooh, no.
I found mine.
Care maintenance of T joints and S bends, just the thing for the bedside reading.
Good night.
Good night.
THE PATHS OF GLORY
LEAD BUT TO THE GRAVE
Sunrise students...
Yeah.
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
That's it.
I found the clue.
International investment advisors limited.
Is that you, Harry?
What, yes.
It's her.
Hello, are you there?
Of course, I'm bloody here.
Where have you been? Never mind.
Did you find anything in that library?
Yeah.
Listen. I thought you said all I had to do is look through a few books. Have you ever seen that library?
Anyway, it wasn't in any book.
It isn't time telling me where it wasn't, tell me where it was.
In the window.
In the window?
Stupid little nutter. What do you mean, "it was in the window"?
Stained glass window. You can only see it when the sun is coming up.
It said, "the paths of glory lead but to the grave".
The paths of glory lead, where?
To the grave.
It's a poem by a guy named
Thomas Gray.
I asked grandma, you know, the lady. She says, it is an eulogy in the country churchyard. I'll call you if I find out more.
Hello, I'm not finished yet, little sweep.
Clara! Leap round to the public
Library and ask them a man called
Thomas Gray.
He wrote a sort of eulogy about a graveyard.
Who are you telephoning?
My stockbroker.
I told them to buy four thousands share of alakezem salt and pepper.
Listen. You are up to something.
I want to know what it is.
Now, you listen. If you don't keep your snar out of my business, your smeller wind up with your ears ought to be.
Well, I must be off. I'll be back by late afternoon.
Granma, you know that poem by
Gray, that churchyard thing, you said it was in the Library.
Oh, yes, we have a very nice copy signed by the author, I believe.
There you are, my dear.
Return it when you finished with it.
Good afternoon, John Henry.
Good afternoon, melady.
How are you today?
Oh, thank you, you are very kind, melady.
I'm in the pink, you might say.
Oh, how is your uncle George?
Ah, melady, I didn't think necessary to trouble you with the news.
We finally had the measuring of his wooden overcoat.
Wooden?...
We buried him last week.
I'm sorry to hear that. But he has been ill for some time, hasn't he?
Oh, begging ... pardon and being wishful to do justice to one and all and not speak evil of the dead,
I must say, Uncle George was uncommon fond of the bottle. He was, you might say, distinctively overpartial and it was that what carried him off to that end.
Oh, John Henry, I hope that will prove a lesson to you.
To me, melady?
Because in recent years, you have been known to take a drop too much yourself and to be unavailable to carry out your duties.
Oh, yes, I see, well, very sorry indeed,
Mary.
Now you may take me to the vicarage.
Wait until the meeting is over and bring me back.
Very good, melady.
I shan't be long, my dears.
Too much.
Well, come on, back to work.
We got three hundred pounds to make up.
If your so sure of cash, why can you not sell, that car?
Grandmother was hated, that is why.
Anyway, it doesn't belong to us, it belongs to the bank.
Mr. Priory had to borrow money for the last year's taxes.
Bobby and I get things ready for the tour.
Come on, you will have to polish the floor of the great hall.
Oh, thank you for the trip.
Polish it, not a stain on it.
We'll go to jam making.
I left apples outside the back door.
And you go and get jam jars washed.
You can peel and core the apples
You can peel and core the apples, queeny.
I'm busy.
Just a minute, queeny.
Listen you! Whoever you are, you are going to do your share like the rest of us.
Do you want to bet?
You just do your share!
It is all the more rest of us to do.
What a pity!
You listen to me.
Give me that book.
To keep castle going we all have to work.
We have to work very hard.
We don't do it because someone is forcing us to, but because love grand, because we like being here.
And if you are going to stay here, you have got to help.
Have I made that clear?
Yeah.
Then let me make one thing clear, queeny.
Around here you are the help and I am the boss.
You want to play rough, do you?
You shouldn't have done that.
She's asked for it.
All the same, it is not very nice thing to do.
Go and see what happen to chickens,
Bobby.
Okay.
Cluny, no.
Nice try.
Cluny!
Oh, Cluny, you shouldn't have.
Yeah, Cluny, you shouldn't have.
Hey, get off my back.
That wasn't very nice.
You got to be kidding.
Let go!
Stop it!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Two against one.
Yes, what was grandmother going to say when she finds it out?
We had the nicest meeting we had in months
No, thank you.
That grateful man Quantenly was away, dipping his sheet, whatever it is, he does.
We made final plans for our automn bazaar. We discussed combining the
Christmas Eve entertaintment at the town hall with the church supper on the Christmas day.
And then we pledged to raise a hundred pounds above our quota in this year's
Red Cross drive.
Then we had tea and the vicar told us amusing stories about his youth in India.
Do you know, Gipping is doing much better with the flowers.
Do you think you'll se him this evening,
Priory?
There is a distinc possibility, my lady.
You may tell him, I'm pleased.
And then the vicar told a funny story about an elephant.
Why do you let your hair hang over your face like that, dear?
It covers your lovely eyes.
Push it back! Push it back, Margaret!
Oh, what happened?
Might I ask?
Do you want to know how I got into this mess?
All right, I'll tell you what happened.
I was sitting at the vegetable garden.
Breeding, minding my own business.
Cluny came up to me, yeah, she came up to me.
And... and she wanted me to help with the few things she was doing.
I said, sure, you know, why not, so I get up to go with her, trip over garden hose, bang my eye and fell over tea kettle down the hill and into the barney, come up covered wit rubbish.
Can I have some mash potatoes, please?
Priory, you will tell Gipping to be more careful in the future of where he puts the garden hose.
As you wish, my lady.
The country churchyard.
Shut up! You miserable, double-crossing little worm!
You thought you are all out, Harry, did you?
After all he has done for you.
I was thinking all that time, really.
I saw that church. I thought, maybe...
Yeah, stroken good fortune.
So did I.
Eulogy in the country churchyard?
Well, that's grave in it.
Yeah, look at it, look at it, nothing just his name and when he died.
Marbe that is the clue, Harry.
When he died, maybe that means something.
Like what? He didn't know when he was going to die. Here we are to dig him up.
Dig him up.
What is the matter with you? Do you want to wake up the whole house?
Here, the old devil , he followed the eclipse for richess and fame and if he would prosper, do ye the same.
Thomas Gray. In a country churchyard.
The cunning old devil.
Do you think that is an eclipse,
Harry?
Of course, it is.
Here, anything to do with an eclipse, now you go through that old house from top to bottom and don't you do nothing else. Do you hear me?
Yeah, yeah.
Get back to the house before they miss you. I'll be in touch in a day or two.
So you better have something for me.
Aren't you going back to London?
London? I can't show my face in London while all the sharks around my gullet. You listen to me. If they chew me,
I'll chew you. And Don't you forget it.
I could be feeding you to the fishes and no one will ever know.
H齢! You don't think he is joking.
Have you ever seen anyone who has been fed for the fishes?
Very nasty, that is. Now and then a person is hold up out of the sea and the authorities looks them through squinched of their eyes, oh, what an horrible massacre, bear to see it and throw him back in. And that is the end of that person. And that is what'll happen to you if you don't do what is expected of you. Just remember!
I got for you first two clues, didn't I?
Well, you better find the next one and be quick about it.
Good morning. Hi. Good morning Casey.
Good morning.
Did you sleep late?
Yeah.
Would you like some scum? We've just made.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.
That is for Casey, not you.
The rest are for tea.
What was the last time you heard about an eclipse around this place, ha?
Here Bobby, make yourself useful, polish that.
Eclipse of the sun or eclipse of the moon?
Either.
We hear sometime. Why do you ask?
No reason.
Look, look, what I found?
Oh, good. Cucumber.
He loves cucumber sandwiches.
What's going on? Who does?
Today is the first place to set them out.
So what?
The first Wednesday of the month
Colonel Dennis comes to tea.
Who is Colonel Dennis?
More tea, Colonel?
Oh, yes, thank you very much.
By jove, they are delicious, those cucumber sandwiches. They are my favourite.
I remember, the club at Cornpow my sice used to bring me  cucumber sandwiches every afternoon.
Do you know, dear vicar was talking about India yesterday and he said, the sice is a groom.
Yes, of course, quite right, yes..., slip of the tongue. My sice used to bring my horse every afternoon.
A black horse.
Seaton,
Seaton, dear old Seaton.
Oh, many of a gin and cognac I won with dear old Seaton.
It was at the time of game manouvres.
Does he really ride that good?
Not likely. Mr. Priory is terrified of horses.
Dennis, he said, you haven't bought that brood, have you? You never get on his back.
Well, I took ald Seaton, I went over those jumps three times at full gallop.
Where are you going with those?
I got bread scums.
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.
Splendid, but very dangerous
Oh, my dear lady, one doesn't consider danger, when one is a soldier.
Oh, Margaret, my dear child.
Oh, Colonel, you haven't met my grand daughter, Margaret.
I'm delighted.
Hello there.
What are those?
Oh, these are some scums.
Mr. Priory thought the Colonel would like some.
You have met Mr. Priory, the butler?
Yes, of course. Splendid fellow.
Well, I must be on my way. Delicious tea, delightful company.
My dear Colonel Dennis, your visits are much too short. They bring a breath of the outside world.
How fortunate it was for me that you moved into the neighbourhood, just when my last old friend left.
Oh, I wouldn't miss my monthly visit with all the tea and china.
Ah, hello children, all well?
Oh, yes, Colonel Dennis, thank you.
Good boy.
Is that your horse? Yes, it's a bit nag actually, but perfectly all right getting around the countryside.
Yeah, I've never seen a saddle like this.
Where I come from there are Western saddles.
Is it hard to ride on him with this tiddy biddy things? No problem really, with these good hands.
Beat me! How do you stay on one of these?
Could you show me, Colonel?
Now? Oh, well, some other time.
Please?
Well, the animal is tired. I rode him pretty hardcoming over here. I had to be walking home.
Grandmother. My dear Colonel, do, please, indulge the child, and me, too.
I've never seen you on horse back.
Yes, well?
Please? Please?
Please? Please?
Let us see you gallop up the drive in true cavalry fashion.
Well, anything to give you pleasure, of course.
You aren't mounting that side, are you?
I'm just checking rubber, leather pieces here. The gird, sir.
I know it is the gird.
It is a regimental policy always to check the gird before mounting.
Just do wait.
How to get this started?
You could have this thing with you.
Colonel's horse must be even more mettlesome than old Seaton was.
Did you see him going up the stairs with the tour? Yeah, he had to go.
One at a time.
Oov.
All right now, if you laugh, just remember, he'll laugh last, last, last.
Oh, how did it go?
I'm afraid castle tour didn't help much.
With the takings of today's tour and the refreshments we're still a hundred pounds short.
Hundred pounds?
Really?
When do you have to pay the taxes?
About a week.
Eight days, to be exact.
Oh, come on now, cheer up. We still have time.
We still have a few things we can take to Mr. Threshers. And next
Saturday at the market we can sell more fruit, more vegetables, more jams and more Cluny's cakes, we ever sold before, right?
Right.
Now, you finish setting up the store. Peter and I will take the stuff to fruit sections.
All right.
All right? Come on, Peter.
I hope we would do well today.
We have to do very well.
We have never taken as much as a hundred pounds before.
You haven't? Well, maybe your sales technique needs a little overhauled
Sales technique.
Yeah. Any of what you got to sell is the way you sell it.
Okay, okay. Walk up, folks!
Walk up folks! You have never seen such enormous eggs in all your life. You can dice them, spice them, fry them, scramble them. We got round ones, large ones white ones, small ones, anything you like.
Fantastic.
Every one laid by that famous hen, mirrorbell.
Walk up, folks! Walk up, folks! If you're lucky you might get lots of candy vegetables grown by the famous gardener, Gipping, who works with the queen of Buckingham Palace.
Who wants enormous eggs, now?
Enormous eggs.
I'll take half a dozen, please. Glad you got here early, madam.
About half an hour all poultry will be sold out.
Oh, in that case I'll take a dozen.
A dozen for this lady.
Okay. Don't miss our gingerbread which
Captain Joshua St. Edmund took on his treasure hunting voyaging. Guarenteed towards all the headaches of Carribean winds.
You can't say that. Why not?
We are selling them, aren't we?
Cakes, delicious scum cakes.
Five pence, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How did we do, Mr. Priory?
Unbelievably wonderful. Splendid.
The most splendid market we've ever had.
Do you mean we nearly made up a hundred pounds?
With what we sold to Treshers and thanks to
Casey's salesmanship it is simply graceful.
Oh, dear. Is that rain? My ladyship is all alone. She hates thunder.
Casey, up on your bike and go on home and take this with you.
Go on, go on.
Go on, pack up.
Get the eggs, cakes and jams
Here take my sweater.
No, I don't want it
I have my jacket, and I'll get on the cart. Okay.
Bobby, get those empty boxes and put them on the cart. Okay.
Peter! Coming.
Good bye.
Get that end.
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Who is there?
Who is that?
Shhh, Quiet!
Do you want the world to hear?
What are you doing here? Did you put the lights off, Harry?
No, must be the storm here. Why didn't I hear from you, he?
And what are those stuff in the village market, he? Buy my eggs, all large, brown, white, boil and fry. Watch your leg!
Well, I... I got... I got to pretend, all like. I'm one of the family, don't I?
You have got to find that treasure. That is what you got to do. And no mucking about.
Do you hear? What does eclipse mean?
Do you hear?
Well, I don't know, just yet. But I'm working on it. I really am.
Priory, children.
No.
It's me, Casey, ee, Margaret.
You keep that old lady out of here, or she dips it with this. Now, get rid of her.
Oh, Margaret, my dear, oh, I'm so glad you are back safely.
Where are the others? All in town with
Priory.
In this dreadful weather?
They'll be back pretty soon.
Every time there is an electrical storm our lights go dead. Priory always knows how to fix them, though.
What do we do without him, I can't imagine. Oh, I must go and dress for dinner.
Hey, what are you doing with that?
What does it look like?
I am taking it. Ain't I?
Yeah, but that is the money for the taxes.
That money is going to save my eye and feed the old sharks. Say, you were attacked by a burglar when they got back.
Yeah, but if they don't pay the taxes, then they'll have to leave and I will not be able to search for my clues.
So much the better. We'll have the place to ourselves to ransack it from top to bottom.
Harry! Keep an eye on that eclipse.
I won't let you.
Harry!
Harry, wait, please.
Let's get out of here.
Harry, don't, Harry.
Get out of the way. Get out of the way,
I tell you.
Please don't.
Get off!
Get off, I said.
Stop, Harry.
AUCTION
To be held at Candleshoe.
I checked all the wardrobes upstairs, my lady. I'll see to other things, gramophon and so on. All sent on to your new address.
Thank you, Priory.
My husband and me on our wedding day.
Most handsome couple, my lady.
Yes, And this is my dance programme from the Balberry Hill for the Prince of Wales at
Candleshoe.
The prince asked me for every dance.
My husband was furious.
Your Highness is a most striking man.
I remember the Waltz.
I believe I still have a gramophone record of it.
Here it is. On top we had glorious times here, hadn't we?
I thought dancing at Candleshoe would have never end. But it has at last.
No. Soon perhaps, but not so long as I'm here.
Please, play the gramophone record,
Priory. And you and I'll waltz.
Oh, never lady, absolutely not.
I insist.
It wouldn't be appropriate.
Would it be appropriate if I were to waltz with Colonel Dennis?
I'm sure, he dances better than he rides
You did him very well, Priory.
You knew, ha?
We were playing games with time, you and I. And I thank you for it.
I'm terribly embarassed.
You needn't be. I'm very grateful for your splendid talent and even more for your compassion.
And now, if you please, the gramophone record.
We're here to see Casey Brown.
Yes, she is in bed.
Hi.
This is for you.
Thanks.
These are for you, too.
They are plums.
They are kind of squashy.
Thanks.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
Oh, you are right.
They are kind of squashy.
Haven't caught the thief yet.
No?
The police haven't got anything to go on.
Well, like I told them, I never saw his face.
You were in the kitchen with him. You chased him all the way through to try to stop his car and never saw his face?
It was dark.
Well, we have come to say goodbye.
What do you mean, goodbye?
Where are you going?
We have got to go back to church in town.
Candleshoe is being sold to pay the rates and taxes.
What about grandma?
There is a place in the county house.
Very nice really. Lots of people at her age.
You are putting me on, aren't you?
Grandma is at old folks' home?
With the house gone, there was nowhere else she had to go.
Look, Casey, if there is anything you know that you haven't told us...
I don't know anyting.
Anything.
Well, I'm afraid we must go.
Yeah.
Thanks for the plums.
Goodbye, Casey.
We'll miss you.
Don't lose your garlic.
I won't.
Goodbye.
Hey! Cluny, all of you! Come on back.
I got a few things to say.
This was the last clue.
He followed the eclipse for riches and fame and if ye would prosper, do ye the same.
What, perfectly simple.
The eclipse was a ship.
A ship?
Captain Joshua's ship. There is a picture of it in the house. Captain Joshua abord the eclipse, accepting the sword of Spanish Captain, whose ship he had captured.
Of course, that is the clue.
Come along everyone. It is hanging in the hall.
My Lady?
It is not hanging in the hall.
You sold it, Mr. Tresher, you sold my painting.
It was my painting. You sold it to me.
That is, Mr. Priory sold it to me, that is.
Mr. Thresher, it was quite proper to sell the painting, but it is impelled for us to look at it. So who did you sell it then and where is it, now?
Well, I sold it to an American lady only yesterday.
She said that Captain Joshua reminded her of her father.
Another pirate, no doubt.
I had it packed up and sent down to
Hambledon Station
It is leaving at 12:20 for London.
She has gone down the SouthHampton, in time to embark on
Queen Elisabeth.
Get in the car, Peter. We'll catch the train 12:20.
But it is 12:15 now. 12:20 was never on time for eight years.
There goes the train 12:20. 12:20. What a terrible time to break a perfect record.
This is the last opportune here in London.
Are we late?
Of course, not.
Give chase, Priory.
We must let them down somehow.
Everybody out.
Priory, you parked my car across the track.
Yes, my lady.
Where is the train stopping sign?
There isn't stopping sign.
They have marvellous brakes on this locomotives. Over there, quick.
My lady.
I shall remain here, thank you.
My Lady?
You just said it would stop in time.
Yes, but...
They have marvellous brakes, I believe.
My Lady, I must insist.
I shall not leave this car.
Just make sure it does stop in time?
Very good, my lady.
Thank you, Priory.
Here now, what is going on?
Do you mind... Do you mind if we have a look at something in your baggage van?
Yeah, that is the eclipse, all right.
But where is the clue?
Captain Joshua has his sword to the document. Is something written on it?
Under foot in the great hall look high look low scavo so end just the statement.
In the great hall?
Under foor?
Priory, do you have the key?
I  have it, my lady.
Peter, go and get my tools, hurry up.
Right here, under the mantle somewhere.
Mr. Bundage? What a dreary idea!
What on earth are you doing here?
My ladyship, good afternoon, we saw the place after sale, we could stop and have a quick look around.
Until tomorrow this house is mine and will you all kindly leave?
I made a nice cup of tea for you,
Harry.
Lorry!
Grimsworthy!
What is she doing here?
What are you doing here? You were dismissed for stealing and you were told never to return.
All right, stop that talk.
Charlie, shut the doors!
All right, come on.
You stay here, my lady.
Let go!
Let's call the police.
It's engaged.
What?
Busy!
Come on, hurry!
Priory, the children! We must see what is happening to them.
I'll go my lady, you stay right here.
Mr. Bundage, put that down at once.
Keep back!
Let's stop being hasty.
That treasure, it is only mine or else nobody's.
This is an emergency. No, there is nothing wrong with my telephone.
Give me that.
Come on!
Hurry!
Hello, operator, operator.
Leave that phone!
Look out!
Hello, operator!
Get him!
All right, quick, go and get the police.
Go quickly! To the police, quick!
Now, go on, go, go!
Hey, Clara!
Go to this way!
Priory!
You swine! My regimental tie.
Did Gipping get away?
I don't know.
Cluny, you better go for help just in case.
Look out!
Hey, duck!
Hey.
Come here.
What's happening?
Kuchi, kuchi, kuchi, kuchi.
And don't come back!
Everybody to the great hall, quick!
My lady, please.
Casey, find something to close the door.
How about that?
Do you think that is going to hold?
No, I don't.
We barricade it, as well.
Right. How about the iron sailor?
Good idea. Everybody help.
Mind your hands, my lady.
Push!
Don't stand, get them!
What is going on?
Captain Joshua, you old rogue
I'm not very good at good byes.
Apparently not.
Where are you going?
I don't know. Bad days, I guess.
I see.
Now, listen.
I never belong to Candleshoe.
I mean, I pretended I did, but I don't, all right.
Not enough excitement here for you?
Yeah, you must be kidding.
Perhaps it is the people in Candleshoe you don't care for? Priory, the children.
Well, they are okay.
Perhaps it is me?
Yeah, okay, you got it, it is you.
I mean I came here to do a number on you. You are straight hussle.
I mean, I didn't know you and I didn't care, but now...
But now?
Now... now it is diferent.
Thank you.
I'm very fond of you, too.
I don't mind in the least that you lied to me when you first came to
Candleshoe.
But my feeling would be hurt very much if you lie to me now.
Do you really want to go back to Los
Angeles?
Never cried in my life.
Then I think it is just about time that you did.
Come along, my dear.
We are going home.
Supposing, your real grand daughter shows up?
Perhaps she has.

[Wind howling]
No man should have to face mornin' or old man Bloodshy sober.
That's a good idea.
Why don't you wait here, and I'll go and get us a drink?
It'd been better if I'd thought of it five minutes ago.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, there.
We are here, sir.
Here, I'll give you a hand.
You do, and you'll get my foot, you jailhouse jellyfish.
Mind the wind, sir.
And mind your business,
Mansfield.
[Howling continues]
Great glory.
Take a look at that sight, will ya?
Mine.
Bloodshy territory as far as the eye can see.
The doctors are quite concerned.
How much time does he have?
According to the doctors, if he doesn't take care of himself, it will be soon.
How much time if he does take care of himself?
They give me at least two days.
And that's why we're here.
To get a last look at what
I'm leaving to my heirs.
Heirs?
The land, the town, the money.
When you say ‘heirs,’ you do mean your son
Wild Billy, don't ya?
When I say ‘heirs,’
I mean just that.
I found my other boy.
Many years ago,
I grew a might too wild for my bride's highfalutin ways.
So one day, she up and ran off back to England, taking half my sons.
Half?
You mean you got two boys?
Traced him to Philadelphia.
This town needs another
Wild Billy like it needs an earthquake.
You eat them words afore I pound your face into a flapjack.
We better write a new will so everything's fair.
You can stick your quill back in the goose.
I already writ out my will.
And you ain't gettin' it until I'm ready to go.
But a new will?
Mansfield, what do you know about this?
Absolutely nothing, sir.
I never heard of it.
What are we gonna do?
Will you wait a minute while I think about this?
There's gotta be an answer.
Whoa!
- Bloodshy!
- Bloodshy!

- We've got their attention.
- Get outta here!
Those guys over on 10th Street were listening a lot better.
They were throwing rocks.
Eli, is that you?
Oh, Father Joshua.
I'm sorry to bother you during your work, but I have a very important letter for you.
It's marked ‘special delivery’ and ‘urgent.’
And look at that postmark.
Arizona territory.
That's way out West.
That's curious.
Good shot, Harry.
I didn't know my father.
I didn't even know
I had a father.
Now I've found and lost him all in one letter.
I guess you're an orphan,
Brother Eli, like us.
At least he's a rich one.
Only when we are giving,
Brother Marcus.
Of course, that's what you meant to say.
Oh, sure.
How rich are you gonna be?
Well, it appears that there is a considerable inheritance.
It mentions land and there is a town, and it says, ‘A considerable amount of money.’
Ha ha ha.
Imagine the good work we could do with that kind of wealth.
I guess you'll be out there a long time.
Just long enough to claim my inheritance, and then we'll be back.
You mean we're going with you?
Brother Demetrius says it might help your education.
Yahoo!
Out with the cowboys and the guns and the shoot-outs!
No, Brother Marcus, not in my father's town, no.
Remember, whosoever seeks peace and love shall find it.
If you have more dreaming to do, do it with your eyes shut.
We've got a long journey tomorrow. God bless.
- God bless.
- God bless.
ALL: 1, 2!
Whoo-hoo!
You have a go at me now, Sam.
Oh, thank you, Billy.
Thank you.
Hold it!
Easy, Billy.
We know you're grievin'.
- We ain't lookin' for trouble.
- Well, you found it.
Next time, it won't be your hardware.
It'll be your head.
Aw, quit shakin', Doc!
You made me miss.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'm sorry.
Set 'em up again, Red Dog.
What's up, Ragsdale?
I'd like a little privacy.
You, come inside.
Wonder what he's gonna do when he finds out he's got a brother.
Don't worry about a brother that ain't gonna show up.
How's that?
Boys, you got a job to do.
[Cows mooing]
ROXANNE: Marcus, look.
Something's coming.
MARCUS: Yeah.
It's a stagecoach.
The kind that gets held up.
I hope not.
Don't worry.
That's why the armory is riding shotgun.
Eli, the stagecoach is here!
[Whistling]
Yah! Yah! Go on!
Get goin', now!
Yah! Yah! Hah!
Come on, now!
Whoa!
Hey, you, there.
Shake a leg.
We ain't got all day, you...
You can take as long as you want, Billy.
Just say the word, and you got all day.
I beg your pardon?
You ain't gonna get a quarrel outta us.
See?
He dropped his gun.
Does this stagecoach go to Bloodshy, please?
You bet your sweet life it does.
Anyplace you say.
Bloodshy, Carson City,
Timbuktu.
You name it, and that's where we're goin'.
We got nothin' but time.
There ain't no passengers to bother ya.
I'd be obliged if you could store that for me, please.
Okay.
Thank you.
And that one.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
You just take your time.
Wild Billy's talkin' peculiar, ain't he?
Probably liquored up from grievin'.
Should we make a run for it?
I don't know.
He probably got 'em hid under that coat.
Right, driver.
We're all in now.
Yes, sir.
Hooo!
[Whistles] Ho!
Let's go!
Yah! Yah!
Come on, now!
People sure seem polite around here.
They even call you by your first name.
Even if it's the wrong one.
I've noticed.
‘Billy.’
I wonder why.
Hah hah! Come on, there!
[Whistles]
Hah! Get along, there!
Hah!
Go on, now!
Get along! Hah!
[Whistles]
Hey, get outta there!
Ho! Ho!
Ho, there!
Ho!
Ho, there!
Hey, you, there!
Get that thing outta the way!
Sure.
But first we got a little business.
Boys!
We ain't carryin' gold.
No, but you got a passenger we want.
- You want him?
- Good luck.
Yeah.
I had a feelin' we might need this.
You! Inside!
Come on out!
We got a surprise for ya!
What's he doin' out here?!
Heh. You kinda took us by surprise.
Another one of your jokes,
Billy? Ha ha ha!
[Forced laughter]
Guess this one's on us.
We come all the way out here and find out it's you.
I don't know who you are or who you think I am.
But I do know you shouldn't point that.
It's liable to go off and hurt somebody.
MARCUS: Get down!
- Run for it!
- Out of my way!
Move it!
Run!
Let's go in the hills!
Why, he's crazy!
Let's get outta here!
Wow!
That was awful!
Did I tell ya?
Our first day in the West, and we've already been held up.
We better take this thing with us.
We don't want it to fall into the wrong hands.
I'm so tired,
I can hardly walk.
Don't worry. When we go through the Badlands, you'll be running.
We don't run, we walk.
Head high, Brother Marcus.
By holding good thoughts and relying on the power within us, our burden shall be lifted.
Do you remember that prophet of old, Elijah?
A man of righteousness and goodness.
He was sent to his final victory, his eternal destination, in a fiery chariot.
WOMAN:
Whoa! Whoa there!
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa! Whoa, there!
Look out!
Are you all right?
Yes. These critters seem to have a mind of their own.
What are you doing in the middle of the road?
We were just walking along.
Are you gonna stand there babbling or help me?
We'll help.
Give the lady a hand.
The fiery chariot.
I imagine you could use a lift.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
As far as Bloodshy.
So are we.
First the fiery chariot, and now she's taking us to Bloodshy.
See? You don't have to run if you listen to Brother Eli.
There.
Thank you.
Hey, I'm Jenny Willingham.
Are you a dance-hall girl?
Marcus.
No, I'm a schoolteacher.
How do you do?
I'm Eli Bloodshy.
We're missionaries.
That's Roxanne, and this is Marcus.
- Bloodshy, huh?
- It was my father's town.
He passed away, but I'm going to collect my inheritance.
Now, am I just gonna stand here or get that lift?
‘Put me down,’ I said!
Put me down!
Oh, Mansbridge.
Field, sir.
Oh, yeah.
What can I do for you,
Fieldbridge?
It's Mansfield, sir.
Oh, yeah.
Well, them English names are all Greek to me.
[Clang]
You wanna watch it there?
I'll turn your overnight stay into a life sentence.
You gotta keep your eye on 'em so they don't fly the coop.
We had a little fire in here thanks to Mr. Wild Billy.
One of these days, I'm gonna put the cuffs on him for good.
If you don't mind, sir,
I'm looking for Mayor Ragsdale.
Mr. Bloodshy's will.
Well, if it has to do with law, you came to the right place.
It's to be administered by the mayor.
Leave it to me, Mainstream.
[Clears throat]
Now, you remember you're on your honor!
‘I, Jasper Bloodshy, last will and testament, my entire inheritance...’
It's a contest.
It is?
No, it isn't.
It isn't?
Not when the other contestant can't make it.
Why can't he make it?
Because the poor sucker's on his way...
Sheriff, don't you have anything better to do?
No, not now.
Go out and find Wild Billy.
Wild Billy?
Tell him it's official.
He's rich.
Wild Billy?
It's good news, Sheriff.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Good news.
Then maybe he won't want a shoot-out.
I'll tell him.
Very rich.
ELI:
Isn't it beautiful, children?
All you can see for miles.
[Caws]
MARCUS: Look at that.
ELI: Bloodshy.
It's my name etched in wood.
So, where will you be staying?
How about the saloon?
Children can't stay at a saloon.
Why not? We're used to places like that.
And there's a lot of souls to save there.
I've made arrangements at a boardinghouse.
I'm sure they'll have room for you.
- Thank you very much.
- A boardinghouse?
That's not where all the shooting and fighting is.
99.9% of all towns in the West are peaceful little villages where nothing ever happens.
Get all that other stuff out of your head, hmm?
[Gunfire, explosions]
[Neighing]
Wow!
Hah!
Hah!
Whoa!
I think we're here.
I don't believe it.
Ohh!
[Coughing]
Oh, uh, sorry.
Mr. Bloodshy, are you all right?
I think so, yes.
Step aside!
Oh!
Ooh!
[Whistles]
Why, you...
Sorry.
[Coughing]
Stop, thief!
Get that varmint!
- Where is he?!
- I didn't see him.
There he goes.
Get down!
Get down!
You sidewinder!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Just a minute!
Just a minute!
Do you mind?
Thank you.
This is no way to solve a problem.
If a man is guilty of a crime, he should be judged in a court of law, not by mob rule and violence.
[All muttering in agreement]
- Yeah, sure.
- Whatever you say.
Just because these men are mean, it doesn't mean they won't listen to reason.
Now, can you tell me where the sheriff is?
I've got something for him.
There he goes again!
He's gone crazy!
Outta my way!
Maybe we'll find him in the saloon.
No, not we.
Me.
You're off to the boardinghouse with Miss Willingham.
- Aw, Eli.
- Jenny.
Besides, you two could use a nap.
Good idea.
Eli, we're too old to take a nap!
Give us a break!
[Piano music plays]
Yo!
Get up here!
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, me and Wild Billy are just like that.
Leastways, we're gonna be.
I got some news that's gonna keep him in booze, babes, and...
Sheriff?
- Billy, don't shoot!
- Pardon?
I got good news!
We got the will.
I seen it myself in black and white.
I cross my heart and hope to die.
Oh, Billy, no.
Let's just check that cannon, okay?
Thank you very much.
One of man's most destructive weapons.
What are you doin' in that crazy suit?
That's all right.
You can wear what you want.
You can do what you want.
You own the town, the land, the money, the land as far as the eye can see.
You're rich, Billy!
Rich!
It's almost too good to be true.
I thought that'd soften you up.
Don't forget,
I'm the one who told you.
[Man talking indistinctly]
Sheriff,
I think I know those men.
Well, I think it's time for a round of drinks.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
What'll you have?
A cup of tea, please.
[Laughter]
- I've sent for the tea.
- Thank you very much.
- BILLY: Yeeeee-ha!
- [Gunshots]
Outta my way, you varmint!
If you wasn't right here,
I'd swear that sounds like you.
[Indistinct yelling]
Yeeeee-hoooo!
MAN:
Now there's two of 'em!
Liven it up! Yeah!
Yeeeeee-hooooo!
He looks just like a real gunfighter.
I don't think we know him as well as we thought.
Yeah! Yeah!
Hah!
This saloon is deader than Boot Hill!
Party needs livenin' up.
That's Eli over there.
Twins?
Twin brothers!
Isn't that wonderful?
What's this?
[Gunshot]
I thought I shot out that mirror!
Don't fire.
No.
[Breathing heavily]
Holy smoke.
The mirror's talkin' to me.
I'm not a mirror.
No.
I don't like this.
How come there's two of me?
I said, ‘How come there's two of me?’
Hold it, Billy.
There ain't two of you.
There's one of each.
Brothers, spittin' images.
Brothers?
Oh, isn't that marvelous?
I'm overjoyed.
Well, I don't need no spittin' image!
Hold it, Billy!
Hold it!
Now, we got us a brand-new will.
Now, it mentions the fact that you got a brother, but it don't say nothin' about him bein' a twin.
Well, I don't need no brother, nor no spittin' twin!
Like it or not, want it or not, need it or not, you got him!
Just whose side are you on,
Mayor?
Oh, Mayor Ragsdale?
- Uh, yes.
- Eli Bloodshy, sir.
I've got a letter asking me to look you up regarding my inheritance.
Your inheritance?
Now, not so fast.
Now, how do we know he's a real Bloodshy?
You talk funny, like a foreigner.
Well, I've got my birth certificate.
I've got my license to drive a cart in Philadelphia.
And I'm expecting my preaching permit any day now.
Oh, Lordy, it ain't bad enough
I got me a brother.
He's a tambourine whacker!
[Laughter]
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, Eli.
Eli, sir.
Yes, Eli.
Yes, we do have an inheritance, but there's a little contest involved.
What kind of a contest?
Between the two of you.
It's spelled out right in here.
Yes, in detail.
Uh, yes.
There it is.
‘Winner take all.’
Between him and me?
Ha!
[Laughter]
What does it consist of?
Oh, just a little race.
[Laughing] Nothin' to be worried about.
You come on now, Eli.
Let me show you the town that your daddy built.
I'll see you later, Billy.
A little race, huh?
On the Bloody Bloodshy Trail.
Well, if'n I was you boys,
I'd get a few bets down in the big city.
That a way, whilst I'm cleanin' up on the psalm singer, you boys can be cleanin' out Reno!
- Yooooo-hooooo!
- [Gunshots]
That's the Bloodshy
Savings Bank.
Hasn't been open since the last robbery.
There's not much money in this town, parson.
I thought my father had considerable wealth.
Yes. It's all safe and sound in my vault there.
Don't you worry about a thing, son.
The lunchroom's shot, too?
People around here seem to get what they need in the saloon.
So I see.
It's the West, you see, son?
It's the wild, wild West.
Hold it.
He's here.
Who?
He is.
Rattlesnake.
But don't worry.
It's gonna be all right.
I got the edge on him.
You do?
Why?
Because he's here, and he knows I know he's here.
But he doesn't know I know he knows I know he's here, but I know.
So I got the edge.
Let's leave this up to the sheriff, son.
You're here.
I know you're here.
Yeah, I'm here, all right.
My sister says you insulted her.
No man insults my sister and stays alive.
Insulted her?
I asked her to marry me.
So, she was right.
Get ready to slap leather.
Then get ready to bite the dust.
[Laughing]
You're fast, Denver, but not that fast.
Nobody's that fast.
I didn't get to be the sheriff of Bloodshy for being slow.
Draw and I'll tattoo your name all over that sheet.
You draw and there'll be another badge on Boot Hill.
We'll see about that.
At the count of three.
[Chuckling]
Aah! Oh!
[Chuckling]
Whahh!
Uh, uh!
It seems what hasn't been burnt down has been boarded up.
I hope the church survived.
No. The church burned down about six months ago.
The church as well?
Perhaps I can speak to your minister.
Well, yeah. You probably passed him on the way into town.
All we passed was a little cemetery.
That great big gray tombstone?
That was him.
You beginning to get the picture, boy?
It's the classic picture of a town on its knees.
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.
Even if you do win that race, look around you here.
- What have you got?
- What have I got?
I've got the most marvelous opportunity a man could have.
Thank you for the most inspiring walk of my life.
What?
Jenny?
In here.
Jenny, fate took us by the hand when it led us out here.
Everywhere you turn, there's a golden opportunity.
What are you doing?
Packing.
It goes along with leaving.
Which is what
I'm going to do.
But there's a real job to be done here.
What job? The school burnt down six months ago.
All the more reason we're needed.
To start a fire department?
To build a new church, to build a new school, to lift this town to its feet, Jenny.
I believe that destiny has spoken to us.
Did destiny tell you where the money was coming from?
- My inheritance.
- What about the race?
The race?
You've heard about that?
It's all over town.
The kids told me.
Considering the life my brother's leading,
I'll be taking unfair advantage.
You don't think you stand a chance to win, do you?
When you're a missionary in Philadelphia, you get to be fast on your feet.
How are you in the water?
When was the last time you shot the rapids?
And how about the six-up team?
Have you driven one?
- I've never driven one.
- Then there's the mountain.
Have you ever climbed straight up 2,000 feet with razor-sharp rocks and death at every turn?
Is that what you think this race is all about?
That's it exactly.
Half of the people are betting you won't come out alive.
That's ridiculous.
You've been listening to rumors and a couple of kids.
Mayor Ragsdale assures me it's nothing more than a plain, simple, ordinary race.
You don't believe him, do you?
Of course. He's a fine, upstanding gentleman.
I like that.
He's a civic dignitary, you know.
But...
Oh.
He must not finish that race, but you gotta make it look like an accident.
I don't know what you're head-up about.
Ain't no way that city dude can make that course.
Well, there's too much at stake to take any chances.
There's something about him that makes me nervous.
Do you boys think that you can handle it this time?
Quit your worrying, Ragsdale.
Takin' care of an hombre like
Eli is our meat and potatoes.
Good. I'll have some gravy for you later.
[Sizzling]
Dinner in a moment, sir.
Try servin' it up here, you overpaid import!
And close your mouth, less'n you're aimin' to catch flies.
If I may, sir, what are you doing up there?
I'm spyin' on you,
Mansfield, to make sure you delivered the will.
Perhaps you were able to get a glimpse of Master Eli.
I would have if'n you hadn't let me climb up here without my spyglass.
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't here.
That's no excuse, you lint-headed limey!
Now look alive!
I'm comin' down!
Very good, sir.
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!
Are you quite all right, sir?
[Spitting]
Now I've had it with you,
Mansfield.
You missed me again, just like your broken-down neck did at the gorge.
Accidentally,
I assure you, sir.
Bourgeois.
If'n you don't kill me by missin' me, you're gonna get me with your poison cookin'.
Well, the stage is now set, sir, and we patiently await the opening curtain.
Don't give me that highfalutin lingo, you shoddy Shakespeare!
Now, what's my boy look like?
As you would say,
‘The spittin' image of your other son,’ sir.
Totin' guns, was he?
Yes. Rather a large rapid-firing one, sir.
Another fightin' fool.
Oh, great glory.
I can see a real battle shapin' up, Mansfield.
Under your watchful eye,
I'm sure it will be a marvelous contest.
Do sit down, sir.
Oh, thank you kindly.
Ah! Ooh!
With you around, Mansfield, my watchful eye may be the only thing left in my body that ain't broke, battered, or busted.
Revival meeting, ma'am.
A pamphlet, sir?
Singin', preachin', and free soup?
- It's homemade.
- Yes.
Free booze, and you might get yourself a crowd.
But free soup?
[Laughing]
Maybe some of the farmers will come.
I sure hope someone does.
I hope those gunfighters don't come.
I don't care what Ragsdale says.
If I had my way, that preacher wouldn't make it to the starting line.
They mean Eli.
He'd never believe that.
He's always looking at the good side of people.
But while he's looking at their good side, their bad side's gonna finish him.
What we oughta do is try to help protect him.
Look!
Five paces, we turn and shoot.
Right.
What about it?
That's a way to help protect him.
How?
Just wait.
You ready?
I'm ready.
You ready?
I'm ready.
You ready?
I said I was ready.
You gonna count, count.
All right.
I'm gonna count now.
Well, count!
Whhaaahhh!
[Growls]
[Gun cocks]
[Gunshot]
[Gun cocks]
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
[Gunshots]
Guns?!
What are you doing?!
Eli needs our help.
They're gonna get him.
I don't care. You have no business playing with guns.
- You want me to help unload it?
- Absolutely not.
Finish delivering those pamphlets. Now move.
You better be careful, Jenny.
The shotgun's still loaded.
Don't you worry about me.
Now, get a move on.
- All right.
- Yes'm.
[Sighs]
- ELI: Ah!
- Whoa!
Ow! Oh!
[Clattering]
Who... who did...
You! You.
You almost killed me!
Eli?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing shooting guns?
You don't understand.
Eli, I wasn't...
Well, if you wasn't, who was?
The children.
Jenny, don't blame the children.
It's bad enough to twist the truth, Jenny.
But to blame two innocent children for this.
I'm shocked.
You... you...
You wait and see.
When it comes to spottin' my son, this has to be the perfect spot, Mansfield.
Innocent children.
Innocent children.
Ah! Ohh!
[Thunder rumbling]
[Groans]
Hmm!
[Grunting]
[Chuckling]
[Thunder crashes]
[Thunder crashes]
All right, Rattlesnake!
None of your tricks this time!
On the count of three, draw!
Countin' three is fair by me.
So long, Denver.
[Chuckling]
[Chuckling mockingly]
[Rain falling]
[Thunder crashing]
- We're gonna be late.
- Jenny, let's go.
What's wrong, Jenny?
Aren't you going?
No, I don't think I will.
- Eli needs us, Jenny.
- It's his first revival meeting.
You'd do anything for him, wouldn't you?
Sure. He's done everything for us.
Maybe even more than a father would have done.
You'd like to have a father, wouldn't you?
More than anything else in the whole world.
Well, maybe I'll bring some soup down later on.
Come on.
No! I tell you, there is hope!
As Solomon told ancient Israel, the house of the wicked shall be overthrown, but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.
A real battler?
You nincompoop!
My son's a psalm singer!
Yoooo!
Mr. Bloodshy.
You better get out while the gettin's good.
The last feller who came here talkin' tabernacles went out feet first.
- You remember that.
- Yeah.
But running away has never been the solution, not when there are kind, decent, peaceful people here who want to live in a community where there's love and goodness.
Looks like his brother and talks like his mother.
That poor milksop stands as much chance out here as a snowflake in the Sahara.
What about my father?
Rest his soul.
He practically built this town.
Practically?!
I cleared timber, drove nails, dug ditches!
What am I telling you for?
You English sissy!
But then he just sat around, let it all turn sour, let it fall into the wrong hands.
Now it's a town of gamblin', gunfightin', hard drinkin', and fast women.
Sounds pretty good to me.
[Chuckling]
But if a town changed for the worse, it could change for the better.
All it needs is faith, courage, and conviction.
I'm ready to stay right here and help you fight to get this town back again.
Well, I guess he does have a smidgen of spunk after all, for a prune picker.
- Mr. Bloodshy!
- Yeah? Ooh.
I'm afraid you won't be here long.
You ain't gonna finish that race.
You know why?
Because there isn't going to be any silly race.
What's he mean, no race?
If’n he cancels my race,
I'll cancel him!
I'm going across the street now and talk to my brother.
We'll split this inheritance and use the money to make this a town worth living in.
Behind those guns of his, there's a fine, decent human being.
[Laughter]
Mr. Bloodshy, do you really believe all that?
I certainly do.
Yes.
Well, you're as crazy as a coot.
He's as crazy as two coots.
Marcus will spread the word.
The whole town will be out there with love and kindness in their hearts.
Roxanne, ring those bells.
[Crowd murmuring]
I've heared enough,
Mansfield.
Now I don't have to hear anymore.

[Gunshot]
Brother Billy, may I suggest we put aside this contest and join our hands together for the benefit of the community?
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You're a-feared to race me.
Certainly not, but I think it's silly for two grown men to compete with each other.
Now, if'n you don't run in that race tomorrow, you're nothin' more than I thought you was.
A yellow-bellied, lily-livered coward from the city.
Now you get outta here afore I'm obliged to blow your brains out.
[Singing continues]
But we still don't have this settled.
And I'm not leaving here until we do.
Oh, you're not, huh?
[Voice croaks] No.
[Laughter]
You ought to be more careful with that gun.
[Laughter]
Say good night to Brother Eli.
ALL:
Good night, Brother Eli!
[Laughter, gunshots]
[Singing continues]
Oh, Eli.
[Laughter]
We'll see you at the race tomorrow, Brother Eli.
That is, if you can get your creakin' carcass to the startin' line.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't get away with that!
Marcus, stop.
BILLY:
Now you won't have to wash.
[Laughter]
When are you gonna realize they don't want us here?
But we are needed.
Eli, they're against you.
All of 'em are.
Just a minute.
You haven't lost faith, have you?
- Of course not.
- Not in you.
Five mighty tests of courage, skill, and strength.
Startin' with the iron donkeys, snortin' little piston-drivin' steam engines, and endin' up with the six-up teams.
Wagons pulled by six powerful horses.
You're gonna see fierce, spirited, untamed, wild-eyed...
You lookin' for me?
I'll tend to you later.
[Chuckling]
Anyway, folks, the finish line is in town.
And one more thing.
Oh, yeah, I get it. Right.
Be brief.
Well, to be brief, folks, stationed at each and every point, there will be an official selected by our impartial race committee to see that there's no hanky-pankying going on.
Morning, Oscar.
Snead.
Hey, $5 says the preacher don't make it to the canoes.
Officials ain't allowed to make bets.
So?
You givin' odds?
You name 'em, you got 'em.
Cat's cradles.
It better be.
[Groans]
Now, push, Mansfield.
Push. Push.
[Grunting]
Ooh, I knew it in my bones, Mansfield.
Fair race, my foot.
My boy Eli's gonna need help, and lots of it.
So I best get my tools.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[Groaning]
Stand fast, you cockeyed Cockney, you.
[Groaning]
Uh-oh.
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.
There's one thing for sure.
Master Eli certainly has a chance with you around.
Sir?
Sir?
Oh, sir!
Oh, and something else
I forgot.
Before we start the race...
[Laughter]
On second thought, let's just start the race.
Bring up the iron donkeys.
What do you think that means?
I don't know.
Eli, we got somethin' for you.
For me?
Be careful.
Don't squash it.
It's for good luck.
In case you need any.
Oh.
Oh, it's beautiful.
MARCUS:
Eli, we know you can win.
Win? He'll be lucky if he stays alive.
Roxanne.
Do you mind just having a little faith?
Contestants, mount your engines!
Don't worry. I have nothin' to be afraid of.
[Whistles]
Cheer up, brother.
We both got somethin' to look forward to.
The town greetin' me and Saint Peter greetin' you.
[Laughter]
- Eli.
- Yes?
For luck.
And be careful.
Now, when you hear my gunshot, that's your signal to start the race!
Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Yeah!
[Click]
Hey, what's goin' on?
When are they gonna start this thing?
[Laughter]
We gonna wait around here all day?
Hey.
[Gunshot]
Uhh!
Eli, you're goin' the wrong way!
[Clattering]
Billy, what are you stoppin' for?!
Ooh!
Get out of the way!
Ooh!
Aah!
Waaah!
Get off me!
Get your foot off of my shoe!
Somebody get a loop on him!
- [Whistles]
- Oh!
Thank you very much.
Push!
Here we go!
Here we go!
Is this a race or a ring around the roundhouse?!
ROXANNE: Come on, hurry!
Get him on the track!
Let's go, Eli!
Go, Eli!
Go, Eli!
Yay!
What's going on?!
You're losin', that's what!
[Laughs]
Come on!
Get him!
Get! Get!
Snail foot!
We'll see you later, brother!
Come on!
[Gunshots]
[Whistling]
Uh-oh.
[Grunts]
Huh?
Aah!
Clear the road!
Clear the road!
[Barking]
[Snarling]
[Whistles]
[Coughing]
Aah!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hey, what's that?
Aw, it's just another Indian sacrifice.
What, a whole tepee?
Yep, looks like it.
What become of your brother?
Should've been here by now.
You get ahead of him?
I guess he's steamin' home, back to Philadelphia.
Holy horsefly!
Would you look who that is.
Now, how did he get there?
[Panting]
[Coughing]
You get back here, you schemin', cheatin' polecat!
You paddle like you talk!
Like a sissy!
Hey, Bloodshy!
Quitters don't run in our family!
Yee-aah!
Yah!
Aaah! Aah!
[Grunting]
Wrong way.
Wrong way!
[Panting]
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Aah! Aah!
Ohhhh!
Help!
[Spitting]
[Grunting]
[Spits, panting]
Aaah!
Looks pretty good for you,
Billy.
Yeah, and pretty bad for him.
Hey, look!
Am I seein' what I think I'm seein'?
I coulda told him this race would get him one way or tother.
[Spits, panting]
Well, looks like you might get your chance.
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
You better get a wiggle on it.
That fella's still a-kickin'.
Come on, Bucky, let's help him out.
MANSFIELD:
Has he succeeded, sir?
JASPER: Has he?
I told you that half-drowneded church mouse is sure givin' him a run for it, in spite of them sabotagin' Sneads.
I daresay the Sneads aren't bright enough to be doing this dastardly deed on their own.
I'll do the daresayin'
'round here, Mansfield.
Oh, very good, sir.
Yeah, I daresay the Sneads don't seem bright enough to be doing this...
Dastardly.
...deed by themselves,
Mansfield.
- Excellent observation, sir.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we best get into town.
I got a hunch who the real schemin' skunk is.
Hop aboard.
Where am I going now?
Up the mountain, just as soon as you refresh yourself with a little water.
Water?
I'm a walking sponge right now.
And a cold one.
Don't matter.
One of the rules.
It's for the well-being of both contestants.
You saw Wild Billy take his, didn't you?
Well, if Billy...
Mountain water.
[Shivers] I've never...
I've never tasted water like this before.
That's the funniest stuff
I've ever had.
Mmm, mmm.
[Gulps]
You know, it's...
It's not bad.
It certainly got rid of those shivers.
[Shivers]
[Slurring] You know...
I kinda like it.
[Sniffs]
A man ought to drink water more often.
I liked visitin' with you, but you better catch Billy.
You gentlemen mind if I take this little old water jug?
Why, I think that'd be all right.
- Sure.
- Good.
Hey, mister!
That's not the mountain.
That's the river.
Oh, that's right, yes.
The mountain and the river.
The mountain.
I'll start right on up.
Yeah.
‘Eli groggy.’
[All cheering]
‘But right behind
Wild Billy.’
[All booing]
You think Eli can win?
Against a stacked deck?
We better find out what they're up to.
RAGSDALE: If you don't get that preacher on the mountain, make sure you get him at Devil's Gorge.
I told you, quit worryin'.
Ain't no possible way he can get by the gorge.
That's good.
All right, here's the gravy that I promised you.
After you get rid of that psalm singer...
Pay attention!
We're plannin' a little dynamite party for Wild Billy at Deadman's Pass.
- Wild Billy?
- Yep.
You want to get rid of Wild Billy, too?
I don't know.
You see,
I've doctored that will.
You see, if nobody wins, then the money and the saloon, the town goes to the executor of that will, and that's me.
Now, you and your brothers, being my partners, why, you'll get, uh, uh... half.
Well, now do you want to bump off Wild Billy?
[Laughs evilly]
Does a coyote like to howl?
Here's where you're gonna come down the trail.
Right there.
That's where you put the dynamite, there.
Got it.
Okay.
This is gonna be a cinch.
All right, now let's go.
Come on.
[Gun cocks]
Sir!
Let go, Mansfield!
They're gonna get my sons!
Over my dead body.
But, sir, there must be another way of handling this.
Would you take your hands off... ow!
- [Gunshot]
- [Neighing]
Where have you two been?
They're gonna get
Brother Eli!
Hyah!
- Whoa! Whoa! What?
- Wild Billy, too!
With dynamite at Deadman's Pass.
Wait a minute.
We don't have time for you not to believe us.
I'm going with you.
Hyah!
Good goin', Billy.
You made it.
Well, what did you expect?
I always figured you'd be first...
- [Eli singing in distance]
- Hold it!
Can you hear somebody singin'?
Yeah. Real pretty.
It's that blasted bulldog.

Now!
[Grunts]
Oh!
Wonder where they came from.
The biggest hailstones
I've ever seen.
Boy, he's slipperier than a dad-gum snake.
[Groans]
Mmm. Mmm.
Ahh.
This has got to do it.
- I'll tell you when.
- Right.
[Coughs]
Okay!
[Grunting]
Ahh.
Ohhh.
The world trembles at your beauty.
Don't tell me we missed him again.
We'll get him.
At the gorge.
That's the way!
Keep it up!
You're doing terrific!
Congratulations, Billy.
Why, with the lead you've got, you could let them horses ride you and still win.
That stall-fed tenderfoot got no business being in the race.
But he hasn't come by yet.
So you don't have anything to worry about.
Wha...
Hello, Billy!
Now, how does that him-hummer keep a-doin' it?
The team's just up the hill!
That's the skinniest-looking bridge I've ever seen.
Ooh!
Yee-haw!
Eli, what are you doin'?
Not that-a way!
Hand over hand!
You mean...
Yeah!
Hand over hand!
[Gasps]
[Wind gusting]
No!
You don't understand!
You don't have to walk on 'em!
Oh!
Come on!
You can make it!
No, he can't!
Aaah!
Hey, preacher!
How do you like the view?
[Laughing]
This is no time to be lyin' down on the job!
[Laughing]
Help!
Yeah, boys, help him out!
[Laughs]
What do you think you're doing?!
After you.
Aaah! Aah!
[Laughter]
Go on, get that other surprise ready up at Deadman's Pass.
This hombre's a goner.
- Okay, boss.
- You bet.
[Panting]
Whoa!

Ah!
[Panting]
Take a long look down and say your last prayer, preacher!
[Laughs]
Amen and adios!
Oh!
There's nothin' like a well-aimed rock, Mansfield.
Unh!
Oh! Ah!
Eli!
If only
I could help you, son.
Eeh! Ooh!
Mansfield, have you gone plum loco?
Aaah! Ohh!
MARCUS: Get him, Roxanne!
Hit him! Hit him!
Ohh! Oh!
Good!
We did it.
Yeah!
He went over easier than I thought.
He sure did.
Look!
Oh, no!
Hang on, Eli!
Aaaaaah!
- Eli!
- Eli!
Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, thank heaven.
[Panting]
Hang on, Eli!
Yeah, hang on!
We'll save you!
[Branch cracks]
Aaah!
Help me up.
Quick, Jenny, the rope!
- [Branch cracks]
- Aaah!
Aah!
Here, Eli!
All right, hit him.
- Hyah!
- Go on! Go!
Hyah!
Aah, aah, aah, aah!
Aah! Aah!
Oh!
ROXANNE: Let go, Eli!
Eli, let go!
Aaah!
Is he all right?
Wow, that mountain water sure makes you do funny things.
Ragsdale's in it with the Sneads!
They're out to get Billy, too.
If both of you don't make it,
Ragsdale gets everything.
You gotta win!
The only thing I've got to do is save my brother.
This map shows the dynamite and where the Sneads are gonna be.
You'll lose the race to save someone who hates you.
Well, isn't that what we're supposed to do?
Help anybody who needs saving, hmm?
Yeah.
I guess so.
Come on.
Come on!
[Sighs]
Come on!
Hey, you two, wait for us!
Tallyho.
Gee-up.
Give me those!
[Whistles] Hyah!
Aah! Oh!
MARCUS: Look out!
Everybody, in the back!
Quickly!
[Bird calling]
Hey, is everybody all right?
MARCUS: Yeah, Jenny.
[Spitting]
Eli, look at that.
Yeah, what is it?
ROXANNE:
It's those Sneads.
Yeah.
[Horse snorts]
You see anything?
No, no sign of him yet.
The lookout has the rifle.
Eli can handle him.
I hope so. We've got to get him away from that plunger.
If he falls on it, the whole mountainside will go.
- I got an idea.
- Oh, really?
You get behind that rock.
Right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Now cover it up.
All right.
Unh!
Why, you little dad-gum cotton-pickin'...
Now!
Aah!
Billy!
Get back!
Get back!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Let go of my hair!
Get off of me, you little pony!
Just keep him buttoned up.
Billy!
[Birds calling]
- Pete, get on that plunger.
- Yeah, boss.
Did he hear him?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
[Muffled grunting]
Ain't a bad swap, huh?
Two brothers for a fortune.
[Grunting continues]
Git!
Hey, he's a-movin'!
When he gets to the mine, they both get it.
[Muffled] No! No!
Shall I help you steady the rifle, sir?
Only when I decide to aim it at you, Mansfield.
[Gun cocks]
PETE: He's getting pretty close, boss.
BOSS SNEAD:
All right, get ready.
Should I blow it now?
No.
Not yet.
Ready?
- Unh!
- Aah!
Billy! Dynamite!
Get him!
Get down!
Oh!
Where is he?!
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Roxanne and Marcus cheering]
JENNY:
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!
I got him, Eli!
I got him!
You?
It was Jenny.
I don't think it was me.
I think it was the...
Oh, no!
Uh, I don't know what that was, folks.
It could have been thunder.
But one thing I do know.
A winner could be coming in any minute now.
Oh, Eli.
I've got to find out.
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Are you just gonna stand there caterwaulin' all day?
Thank heaven you're safe.
I might have knowed it.
Never trust a Bible-banger.
[Sniffs]
You went and ruined everything.
What?
The will says,
‘May the best man win.’
Now I ain't so sure
I am the best man.
You saved my life!
Now, how am I gonna whip a man who saves my life?
Billy, Ragsdale set us both up to be killed, and he's going to get all the money if nobody wins.
Ragsdale?
That snivelin' sneak!
Then one of us has gotta win.
[Cheers and applause]
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you, thank you, boys.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all my loyal constituents.
Now, then, as executor of the estate of the late, great, beloved Jasper Bloodshy...
[Crowd muttering]
I was fully prepared to turn over his entire, every last cent of that fortune to whichever brother wins, whichever one comes in.
[Crowd cheering]
But, uh...
Well, it seems to me that if there is to be a winner, he should have been here a long time ago, hmm?
Matter of fact, it has occurred to me, as I am sure it has occurred to each and every one of you, that some unforeseen, dire tragedy has befallen those two fine young men, huh?
[Crowd murmuring]
Let's take him, too.
No, no, come on.
However!
However, there is a, uh, provision in the will which states that if there is no winner, then the entire fortune goes to...
Rider comin'!
A rider comin'.
Rider comin'?
Who is it?
Can you see?
I don't believe it!
Are you sure that's the preacher?
[Laughs excitedly]
It's Eli!
He's won!
[Cheering]
Whoa!
You're safe!
How's Billy?
Eli, we knew you could do it!
Where's Ragsdale?!
ROXANNE:
There he goes!
MARCUS: With as much money as he can get away with.
Hold it, Ragsdale!
Hyah, hyah!
Go on! Get out of here!
Move it! Hyah!
Get out of here!
Hey, Eli, you're shootin' just like Wild Billy.
Come back here, you consarn, yellow-bellied, lily-livered, two-timin' polecat!
Yah!
Eli isn't Eli.
Eli's Wild Billy.
Another rider comin'!
- Which one's this?
- Is it Eli or Billy?
Now, there's Eli.
I think.
Brother,
I'd like a word with you.
I said, ‘Brother,
I'd like a word with you.’
Later!
Swing me up!
Aah!
[Laughter]
I'm ready, Rattlesnake.
Let's make it clean and fast.
All right.
We'll count to three.
I'm gonna get you, Ragsdale!
Marcus, what are you doing?
Oh, no!
Hey, what is this?
Get that off!
I don't see any way you can trick me this time.
[Chuckling]
Get off me!
What is this thing? Get away!
Get off!
Get off!
- Aah!
- Ooh!
Aah! Aah!
Hold on!
Come on, get him!
Get him, Eli!
He's a crook!
He's got all the money!
Look out!
Tarnation!
Marcus, are you all right?
That was great!
What?
Here he comes, Mansfield!
The dirty fly into the spider's web.
Stand back, Mansfield, and see how the West was won.
Ehhh! Ooh!
MANSFIELD: Oh, sir!
Great jumpin' Jasper's ghost!
Aaah!
Ohh!
Aah! It's a ghost!
It's a ghost!
I can't be seein' this.
I know I'm not seein' this.
- But get off me!
- Nothing doin', Ragsdale!
I'm takin' you with me!
I take everything back!
I'll give you the money back!
Too late, you whinin' weasel!
I'll see you in jail if it's the last thing
I ever do-o-o!
It was the old man,
I tell you! I saw him!
I tell you, it was the strangest thing I ever saw.
He came floatin' down in a white sheet.
The bats have taken over the belfry.
You gotta believe me!
Hey, Sheriff!
Listen, you start that story one more time, there'll be two ghosts, and you'll be one!
I'll be late for that ceremony.
Deputy, keep an eye on the prisoners.
Right, chief.
Deputy?
You gotta believe me, man!
[Cheers and applause]
And so my brother and I have decided to share the money and use it to make a new town.
A town a whole lot different than the one you've been used to.
And if anybody has any other ideas, they're gonna have to answer to m...
[Clears throat]
My brother, Eli.
[Laughter]
It's going to be a town
I hope you'll all be proud of.
I know I'm going to be proud of the new church and the new school we're building.
A new school for our children, yours and mine.
He means us.
We've got a father.
And I'll tell you something else.
Not only will these children have the best teacher, they'll have the prettiest one they've ever seen.
[Laughter and applause]
Of course, I may be a little prejudiced.
I think we're gettin' a mother, too.
[Cheering]
You know,
I can't rightly recollect ever seein' the whole town together with folks a-smilin' at each other instead of shootin'.
[Crowd murmuring in agreement]
I think this is a fitting moment now to pay tribute to the one man who made all this possible.
Our father, Jasper Bloodshy.
It's too bad he couldn't have lived to see his last wish come true.
Amen, brother.
But if you'll all join in with me now singing ‘Something Good is Bound to Happen,’
I guarantee no matter where he is, he'll be happy at this very moment.

- Ouch!
- Shh.
I bumped my knee.
Who cares about your dumb old knee?
Now be quiet and stay down. OK?
What are you doing that for?
- 'Cause thaùs what they always do.
- Who?
The Indians.
Now you stay here.
I'll tell you when to come, OK?
- [Dog barks]
- Ah, Boots.
Stay down, OK?
Shh.
Quiet, Boots.
Shh.
No. Shh.
[Gutteridge] Boots, hush up out there.
[Continues barking]
Oh, Boots!
- [Gutteridge] You hear me, Boots?
- Get away.
[Gutteridge] Hush up out there.
Here. This oughta shut you up.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
How did he do that?
Sam!
Quick, take these. Hurry.
Well, if it isn't
Big Chief Red Top himself.
Don't see you since your ma's bargain hunting at the supermarket.
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.
Everybody's squeezing out the small businessman, and those empties don't help.
It does seem to me I get more of these things back than I sell.
How's that grandpa of yours doing?
I haven't been to see him for awhile.
He's OK.
Well, thaùs six bottles. Be 12 cents.
- You want the usual?
- Yes, sir.
You should ask the lady what she wants.
She wants the same as me.
Samantha?
Thaùs right.
I want the same as him.
OK. Two suckers on the house, and the bottles and jelly beans.
But you better watch out, Napoleon.
When a woman agrees with everything you say, she's really got her eye out for you.
I don't think iùs right.
Iùs not stealing.
We gave him his bottles back.
But they were his bottles.
I don't eat the jelly beans myself.
They're for Charley.
Who's Charley?
Who's Charley?
Want to meet him?
Yeah.
OK. I'll take you.
But you gotta promise to help me on exams tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to.
Well, OK.
Good. Come on.
Here, Charley!
Over here, Charley.
Come on.
Over here, Charley.
Come on.
- Charley's a horse.
- Yeah.
- [Napoleon] Here, Charley.
- [Sam] He knows you.
Of course he does.
Here, Charley.
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm gonna get on him.
He's teaching me to ride so I can be a cowboy like my grandpa was.
Your grandpa was a cowboy?
Yep, and he's part Indian too.
I don't believe you.
You can't be an Indian and a cowboy.
My grandpa can.
Here, Charley. Come on.
[Napoleon] Here's your candy, Charley.
Come on.
He can carry the two of us.
- I can't ride.
- Just hold on, OK?
Come on.
Quick, before he finishes the candy.
Hurry. He's almost finished.
- Hold on tight. He's gonna go now.
- Where to?
Across the field to the water.
The candies make him thirsty.
Come on.
[Napoleon] Giddyup. Come on.
Giddyup, Charley.
Giddyup. Come on.
- [Napoleon] See, isn't it fun?
- [Sam] Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to have a saddle and a bridle?
No. Thaùs only for people who don't know how to ride.
- Giddyup.
- Come on, Charley!
[Napoleon] Thaùs it!
- He likes it.
- Yeah.
Come on.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thanks a lot, Charley.
- You're the best horse.
- Goodbye.
- [Sam] Can you see her?
- There's nobody there.
- Good. She's probably still out.
- She ever hit you for being late?
No. I don't think housekeepers are allowed to.
She justjabbers at me a lot.
I better make a run for it, Napo...
Oh, hi, Gertrude.
So, you finally decided to come home.
Do you know what time it is?
- No, ma'am.
- [Gertrude] Iùs six o'clock.
I don't know what you've been doing, but leùs get one thing straight.
While your mother and father are away, and I'm responsible for you,
I expect to see you home by five.
Now, is that understood?
Yeah.
Go to your room and get changed.
You look like something the cat dragged in.
See you, Napoleon.
[Gertrude] What have you got all over your dress?
- [Sam] Iùs horse hair.
- [Gertrude] Horse hair!
Grandpa, I'm home!
I'm home, Grandpa!
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Ahoy, there, mate.
Hey, you're late.
You been behaving yourself?
I'm glad to hear that.
We've got to keep things ship-shape around here.
- Permission to speak, sir.
- [Seth] Permission granted.
All the other kids are going to the movies. Can we go?
Well, now, that depends.
Depends on what?
On whether or not you're going to give your grandpa's aching back a rub.
Sure.
- Go on now, get the liniment.
- OK.
[Seth chuckles]
Did Captain Morgan really die in a Spanish prison?
Not on your life. There wasn't a prison in the world could hold him.
There's nothing as tough as an old sea dog.
You think I could ever do all the things you did, Grandpa?
Well, if you eat your vittles, keep your curiosity up and your wits about you, you will.
[Flute music]
- What is it, Grandpa?
- Well, darned if I know.
[Music continues]
Step right up.
Join the celebration.
Iùs a real live lion!
Golly!
What are you celebrating?
We are celebrating an ending, my dear friends.
An ending? To what?
To a lifelong partnership.
Yes, and two glorious careers.
Oh, permit me.
Dimetri. The clown.
- [Drum roll]
- Da dah!
- I'm Seth Wilson.
- And I'm Napoleon.
And Major, the king of beasts.
[Dimetri] Won't you join us?
Please, I beg of you.
- Are you sure he won't object?
- Oh, no. He won't object.
He's the most kind and gentle king of beasts.
- Would you do the honors, please?
- The honors? Oh, yes.
[Dimetri] Have you seen such a thing?
[Dimetri laughs loudly]
So, you're retiring?
Dimetri is finally going home.
To Europe.
Is the lion going with you?
Well, that is the predicament.
- That is the sadness.
- [Seth] Why?
[Napoleon] Whaùs the matter?
Old friends should never be separated.
You can't take him with you?
No.
[Napoleon] What are you gonna do with him?
I am searching for a happy place.
Where his majesty will be treated like his majesty.
You tried a zoo?
I have, I have.
They have been very kind and helpful, but... they cannot find a place for an old milk-drinking lion.
An old veteran ofjoy.
Hey, my grandpa used to be a lion trainer.
That was a long time ago.
Did you work in the circus?
No. He trained lions for the Emperor of Ethiopia.
That was quite a long time ago,
Napoleon.
My dear friends...
My beloved friends.
The Major is yours.
You mean that... you're giving him to us?
Not I, but fate.
Oh, no. None of that.
We can't have a lion in our home.
[Napoleon] Why not?
Because he's a wild animal.
Thaùs why not.
He doesn't look very wild to me.
Besides, you said you were a lion trainer.
We can't have him.
He's too expensive.
We wouldn't be able to feed him.
He must eat like a...
No, no. Not Major.
He just drinks milk.
He has bad teeth.
Please!
No. We haven't got any place to keep a lion.
Yeah, we have. We have a cage.
Cage?
Gonna take at least a dozen quarts of milk to keep this boy going forjust one day.
Don't worry, Grandpa.
I'm going to save all my pocket money.
Just to buy milk.
Hold on, now. He isn't too well-acquainted with us yet.
He might be a little feisty in the mornings.
Oh, Grandpa.
He knows us.
He's part of our family now.
Here you are.
Look at him, Grandpa.
I am looking.
And I see a dozen quarts of milk.
What he's going to need is a whole cow.
- [Clucking]
- [Seth] Oh. Well.
One thing at least.
He started the hens back to laying.
Uh, uh!
Oh, Grandpa. Golly.
Well, I declare.
- Bye, Grandpa.
- You're off to school?
Don't dawdle on the way.
I don't want that teacher complaining about you again.
Bye, Major. Have a nice day.
See you when I come home.
- You'll watch him for me?
- Of course I will.
- And you remember what I told you.
- I will.
Don't gossip about him.
The authorities hear about him, they'll take him away. Darn busybodies.
Yeah.
Bye, Grandpa.
Drop this off in the post on your way, will you?
- Where's it going?
- New York.
Oh, yeah. Goodbye.
Yeah.
Thaùs right.
A couple of old timers, you and me.
- Leùs go see Charley.
- No, I gotta go home.
- Well, why?
- I just gotta. Thaùs why.
Want to come over to my house and play?
- No.
- Can I come to yours?
No!
I'm sorry.
- Now, can you keep a secret?
- You know I can.
- Then come on.
- Am I supposed to guess, or what?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You see it when you see it.
Iùs a real live lion!
His name is Major.
Think I could come in and pet him?
Come on in.
He won't hurt you. Pet him.
See? He's nice.
Sure is a nice lion.
Sure is.
Couldn't be any nicer.
He drinks milk.
Must drink an awful lot.
He does.
See? Look. See what he's doing?
He won't even...
26 quarts in three days?
Sure gonna make a dent in the pension check.
Oh, yeah. Thaùs right.
- There you are, Napoleon.
- Thanks, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thank you.
You know, Seth...
You're lookin' a mite peaked lately.
You feeling all right?
Right as rain, Amos.
It stands to reason with all that milk you've been drinking.
I'm not drinking it.
What are you doing, bathing in the stuff?
- [Seth] How did you guess?
- What?
Any doctor will tell you. Milk baths.
When a man gets to be my age, milk supples the flesh.
You ought to try it on that ornery hide of yours.
Can you help me, Napoleon?
So long, Amos.
So long, Seth.
Goodbye, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thanks again.
Bye, Napoleon.
You napping, Grandpa?
What, what?
Me? Napping? No, no!
Just squinching my eyes.
Looking for smoke signals.
Smoke signals? Where?
Over yonder hill there.
Wild Indians send out their messages about this time of day.
Didn't I ever tell you?
No. Golly.
I do believe there is one now.
No, iùs just a cloud.
No, Grandpa,
I think that is a smoke signal.
Yeah.
Come on, Maj. Giddyup.
Ah, you're slow as molasses.
Gosh.
Now get... come on.
Thaùs OK. It was a good ride.
Even if you can't gallop.
OK.
Come on, Maj.
You get in there.
Now, come on.
Get in there.
Your milk's waiting and everything, Maj.
Maj, get in there!
There. Finally.
Golly.
I'm gonna go see Grandpa, OK?
Hi, Grandpa.
Mornin', officer.
Me and Major have had our ride already.
You were sleeping so sound
I didn't want to wake you.
You getting up?
I thought maybe
I'd spend a day in bed.
I'm not feeling so well this morning.
Is your tummy bad again?
Something like that.
Hey, want me to fix you breakfast in bed, Captain?
I'd like that.
OK, I'll fix you something real special.
[Seth coughs]
Well, thank you.
My, my, this looks good.
- Whaùs this?
- Oh, thaùs an onion sandwich.
No.
Whaùs this?
Oh, thaùs chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla ice cream. All melted up.
Oh, my, my. That is tasty.
I think I'll just save that.
Set it over there, will you?
I'll just take my coffee.
Oh, thaùs the instant kind.
Since I don't know how to perc.
But I put in two extra spoons.
Good. Iùs good.
But I think I'll just save this too.
Set it there.
I better go clean up the kitchen.
- Napoleon.
- Yeah, Grandpa?
Come here a minute, will you?
Sit down. I want to talk to you.
- What are we gonna talk about?
- Us, Napoleon.
We are going to talk about us.
We've been a good crew, haven't we?
The two of us. Shipmates.
We've had some good times together.
We sure have, Captain.
The trouble is, your grandpa's getting older.
We both are.
I'm going to be 11 in August.
Trouble is, this old body of mine is just getting older.
Wrinkled old hands, tired old muscles, tickerjust keeps missing a tick now and then.
Then I take a deep breath, and I just keep coughing all the time.
But everybody coughs, Grandpa.
What are you going to do with an old machine thatjust keeps breaking down?
You fix it.
What about when you can't fix it no more?
Well, you gotta trade it in for a new one.
Thaùs just what I'm going to do.
I'm going to trade this old machine of mine in for a new one.
What do you mean, Grandpa?
Iùs nothing to be concerned about, or scared or frightened about.
Iùs just that my old body's dying.
I'm not surprised.
Iùs a wonder it didn't do it years before, the way I treated it.
I never knew anyone who died before.
Nobody ever really dies, Napoleon.
The thing thaùs real in you just keeps going on and on forever.
You know, in a way... we're like the seasons. Life is.
You're born in the spring, then you grow up during the hot, warm summer, then autumn's the time when you reach maturity.
You hit your peak.
Then... then, there's the winter.
It gives us all a chance to go quickly back to spring and start all over again.
But you still have to go away and leave me, don't you, Grandpa?
No, that doesn't follow at all.
You see, I always wanted to take my rest up there on the hill where we used to like to sit and watch the sunset.
'Course, I've made my peace with the Almighty.
I know he's not going to be too concerned about my not having an expensive funeral and all that.
Besides, your uncle.
He'll see to all those things.
You never said I had an uncle or anything like that before.
Well, you have.
He's your last living relative.
He's the one I wrote, and told him all about you.
Is he gonna come and stay with us?
I haven't heard from him yet, but he'll be here, and when I go away, he is the one thaùs going to take care of you.
Whaùs his name?
Charley Hammond.
I know a horse named Charley.
Do you now?
Gee, I hope your grandpa's feeling better.
I'm going in and see him right now.
We'll feed Major a little later.
Wait here, will you?
All right.
Grandpa, I'm home!
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
I didn't know you were asleep.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
[Seth] Remember, son, iùs nothing to be frightened about.
Just means that old grandpa's set free to get around again.
Whaùs the matter, Napoleon?
Something wrong?
Did you ever know anyone that died before?
[Sam] No.
Did...
[Napoleon] My grandpa just did.
Oh, Napoleon.
Iùs...
Iùs nothing to be scared or worried about.
Just means that... my grandpa's free to do what he wants to now.
See, thaùs just his old body in there.
You know, my grandpa said that... nobody ever really dies because... the thing thaùs real inside of you goes on and on forever and ever.
I think thaùs very beautiful,
Napoleon, but... who's going to look after you now?
My uncle.
Where's he?
- In New York.
- When's he coming?
I don't know just yet.
He's supposed to write.
Whaùs it say?
"Unclaimed mail."
Do you know what that is?
I think it means that nobody was there to get the letter.
Napoleon... was that your only uncle?
Haven't you got any more relatives?
- No.
- You'll have to live at the orphanage.
Thaùs where they put people that don't have any relatives.
- I won't go.
- They'll make you.
No, they won't.
I won't tell anybody my grandpa's dead.
You can't keep that a secret.
Yes, I can. You better not tell anybody.
But they'll see the funeral.
There's not going to be any funeral.
I'm going to bury my grandpa up there on our hill.
Where we used to sit and watch the sunset.
Thaùs what he always wanted.
He told me that.
Well, who's going to do it?
I'll have to do it myself.
He's too big for you to bury.
Then I'll have to hire somebody.
Do you know anybody I can use?
You'll have to go see the employment office.
You better hurry.
They probably close at five o'clock.
How you doing, general?
I'm a captain.
If you're a captain, where's your hat?
I haven't got it yet.
I just became a captain.
Oh.
Next, please.
- Hi.
- Occupation?
I have a degree in political science, but...
We have this job in a lumber camp.
If you qualify, iùs steady employment.
I don't want it too steady.
I'm still going to school...
Sorry, thaùs all we have.
Don't you have just a little odd job?
I have to buy a book.
"Thompson's Theory of Modern Organization."
We only deal with people who are interested in regular employment.
Closed for now.
Right.
Well, thank you very much, ma'am.
Appreciate it.
- Hello again.
- I was wondering if we could talk.
Sure. What do you want to talk about?
Ecology? The political scene?
The stock market?
Hello, Napoleon.
[Napoleon] Hi, Gertrude.
Napoleon, huh?
Yeah. Whaùs your name?
Daniel Arlington Williams the Third.
But you just call me Danny, all right?
What are we gonna talk about?
Well, I wondered if you wanted to work for me.
It depends.
Think you can afford my services?
I don't know.
How much does that
"Thomas' Organization..."
Whatever it is cost?
Iùs a book. Costs about, oh, four dollars and fifty cents.
- I have that much.
- Did you come by that honestly?
Yeah, iùs mine.
Will you work for me?
OK. What do you want me to do?
Iùs a secret.
You gotta promise not to tell anybody.
I promise.
I cross my heart. I promise.
Well...
I want you to help me bury my grandpa.
Now, I'd like you to tell me again exactly what your grandfather said about your uncle, and...
[lion roars]
Whaùs that?
Oh, thaùs Major.
My lion.
Iùs time for his milk.
Your lion.
Then my grandpa said he didn't want anything like a fancy funeral.
He wanted to be buried up there on our hill.
Where we used to go and watch the sunset.
I guess a man can have his own private burying grounds if he wants to.
Thing is, we can't keep it a secret.
Just until my uncle gets here.
Or else they'll take Major away from me.
Yeah, I guess they would.
Well, we'll need some wood and tools.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Be nice if we could be ready by sunset.
OK.
For everything there's a season.
And a time for every purpose.
A time to be born and a time to die.
And as the setting sun comes to rest on this beautiful day, so rests our friend peacefully in the arms of Mother Earth.
Now like the sun that has set so it can rise again, so rests our friend that he can rise in a new life.
We shouldn't feel sorrow for the setting sun.
Nor should we cry for our lost friend.
I think thaùs all.
Napoleon, you have anything you want to say?
Thanks, Danny.
Grandpa...
I love you.
- You know something?
- Hmm?
I'm having second thoughts this morning about the whole thing.
Whaùs the matter?
I can't go.
I mean, I can'tjust take off and leave you here alone.
I told you, I'll be all right until my uncle gets here.
Thaùs another thing.
This whole uncle business sounds iffy.
What happens if he doesn't get here?
You're sure there's no place you can reach him now?
Uh, uh.
He's on his way here.
Must be Sam for school.
Come on in, Sam.
- Hi, Napoleon. Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Sam.
- How you feeling this morning?
- Fine, thanks.
Good. Why don't you sit down and join us.
Napoleon, your uncle should be here by the end of the week, right?
OK, I'll stay here till then.
Oh, but I'll be all right on my own.
Why don't you come and stay at my house?
Wait a minute.
Can he do that?
Sure. There's just me and Gertrude.
My folks are away.
Thaùs the answer.
Now I can go back to the cabin without worrying.
I bet iùs neat up there in the mountains.
Beautiful.
Do you think Maj and me can come up and stay with you?
Of course you can. You too, Sammy.
We'll have a picnic. Bring Maj.
I got lots of milk for Maj.
Whaùs this for?
Show us where you live.
I live right... right there.
Thaùs 14 miles across the mountains.
Two valleys, three ridges, the roughest country you ever seen.
Thaùs definitely not the way.
Bet I could make it.
Forget it.
What you have to do is take the highway to Pinewood Junction.
A guy named Gypsey's got a service station there.
He lends me his shack.
I take care of his sheep and goats.
Ask Gypsey and he'll take you up the back road in his jeep.
- All right?
- OK.
Leùs not wait for social calls, know what I mean?
If anything goes wrong, find Gypsey and he'll get in touch with me.
OK, but nothing's going to go wrong.
Will you be coming back here soon?
I should be back in a couple of weeks.
When your uncle arrives, you tell him everything, OK?
All right.
Goodbye, Danny.
- See you soon. Bye.
- See ya.
- Will you, Napoleon?
- Will I what?
Come and stay with us.
No, I gotta stay here and take care of Maj, like right now.
[Gutteridge] I swear.
That grandfather of yours.
He's coming into his second childhood.
First milk baths, then stuffing himself with candy.
No wonder he's feeling poorly.
Tell him I'm coming to see him tonight.
You can't do that.
Why can't I do that?
I've been coming to see your grandpa regular since before you were born.
Well...
Because he's going to be out tonight.
Then, I'll see him tomorrow.
Maybe Mr. Gutteridge won't come tomorrow.
'Course he will.
He and my grandpa were best friends.
What if Danny won't let you stay with him?
He will... when I tell him that
I don't have an uncle and all.
I still think you ought to find Gypsey like Danny said.
Sure, and take Maj on the bus with me?
No, sir.
I'm gonna hike right over those mountains, just like Danny does.
Sure wish I could go with you.
See if you can do it. I can't.
I'll be right back.
If you're going to take
Doodle-Doo with you, you can't put him in the knapsack.
'Course not, you nut.
He's for you.
Oh, Napoleon, you shouldn't have.
I love him.
Would you like me to come and feed your other chickens?
No.
I'm gonna turn them loose.
I better get home.
Goodbye, Napoleon.
I really wouldn't mind going with you,
I mean... if you're afraid or anything.
Afraid! Why would I be afraid?
I mean, I've got Maj with me, haven't I?
Afraid.
I'm sorry.
Bye, Napoleon.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not. What about Gertrude?
- She'll be all right.
What do you mean
"she'll be all right?"
I left her a note. Said I was gonna stay with you and your grandpa.
Please, Napoleon.
I want to be with you.
You'll get scared.
No, I won't.
- Not with you and Maj to protect me.
- [Napoleon] Well...
OK. But you gotta promise never to cry.
I promise.
OK. Come on.
[Laughs]
Napoleon!
[Sam] Napoleon!
[Roars]
- [Sam] Napoleon, help!
- [Napoleon] What? Whaùs wrong?
Napoleon, look!
[Napoleon] Oh, no.
[Napoleon] Go get him, Maj!
Go get him!
Go get him, Maj!
[Sam] Come on! Get him, Maj!
[Napoleon] Come on, fly Doodle-Doo!
[Sam] Get out of here!
[Napoleon] Get out of here!
Go on! Get!
[Lion roars]
That a boy, Maj. You really showed him.
Here, Doodle. Here, boy. Come on.
Come on, boy.
He's OK. Just a little scared. There.
What are you shaking for?
I thought it was gonna get me,
Napoleon, I...
Don't worry. Nothing's gonna get you as long as Maj is around.
Here.
I'll give him some of my sandwich.
He loves it.
Why won't he come?
'Cause he's a cat.
- Cats don't like water.
- [Lion growls]
- [Sam] Good boy, Major!
- [Napoleon] Oh, Maj.
Oh!
- Aah!
- [Napoleon] Major.
Golly.
If he doesn't like water, what does he do when it rains?
[Napoleon] Gets wet.
Napoleon?
I don't like to complain, but my foot hurts.
- I'm tired.
- I know.
I was gonna stop for the night as soon as I could find a good place.
Hey, waitjust a second.
Hey!
You know something?
There's a barn just over the hill.
We can spend the night there.
We gotta be careful nobody sees us.
Come on.
Come on, Major.
There's nobody there.
Come on. Leùs go.
Iùs nice. Glad we found it.
Yeah, iùs OK for tonight.
Here you go, Doodle.
You'll love it here.
Iùs not here.
Whaùs not there?
Pinewood Junction.
I'm looking for the back road that leads from Gypsey's up to Danny's place.
Iùs just not here.
Sure you got the right map?
Of course I'm sure.
We can't see anything at night.
I'll look for it in the morning.
'Night. 'Night, Maj.
[Owl hoots]
[Wings flap]
Napoleon?
Are you scared?
No.
Don't you ever get scared?
[Napoleon] Whaùs there to be scared about?
- Lots of things.
- [Napoleon] Like what?
The dark.
The dark never hurt anybody.
Things in the dark.
Things like what?
Things thatjump out and scare you.
Thaùs all in your imagination.
Still scares me.
Thaùs kind of dumb. I mean... my grandpa said that people just make up things in their mind to be scared about.
Now go to sleep.
- How do you make it work?
- Easy. You just have to squeeze it.
Don't squeeze too hard, or she'll kick.
[Napoleon] Hey, it works!
I'm glad we decided to leave him there.
He seems happier.
Yeah, Doodle always liked to be with hens.
Come on.
[Sam] Iùs getting awful steep,
Napoleon.
[Napoleon] I told you.
Just don't look down and hang on.
- Napoleon, look at him.
- Aw, Maj.
Thaùs no place to lie down.
Now get up.
I feel like I'm going to slip.
What am I going to do?
Can't you kind of inch around him?
[Sam] I can't.
Climb right over top of him.
And put your foot right there.
He's just a little scared, but don't worry.
Give me your hand. Come on.
Now jump.
Gotcha.
OK, there's a level spot.
Now stay there. Iùs safe.
What are we going to do with him,
Napoleon?
We're gonna have to get him going again.
Oh, Major.
Major, go, Major.
Go!
Major! Go on, Major.
[Sam] Napoleon!
I'm OK.
I'm OK.
Napoleon.
Napoleon!
Don't get scared.
Just let me think.
I know.
Throw Major's rope down to me.
Maybe iùll reach.
There.
OK. Pull me up, Maj!
Pull me up!
Here, Major. Come on, Major.
[Sam] Good boy. Pull.
Thaùs it! Pull!
- [Sam] Come on, Major.
- Pull! Pull me up!
OK. Made it.
Thanks, Major.
Thanks a lot.
I didn't think anything would happen to her.
I thought she was with a boy and his grandfather.
Thaùs what she wrote in the note.
You read it.
Yes, ma'am.
Did she spend most of her time here?
With Napoleon, yes.
The last time you saw the boy he was walking down the street with a strange man. A "hippy type."
Thaùs right.
He's the one you should be checking on right now.
Excuse me, Chief.
Iùs a pity you don't like water.
Makes your feet feel real nice.
[Growls]
Sam! A bear!
Sam! Sam!
Get out of here!
Sam! Sam!
Iùs a bear, Maj!
Come on, Major! Iùs a bear!
Come on.
- [Sam] He won't budge!
- [Napoleon] Sam!
Get out!
Come on.
Major, get up. Iùs a bear!
Don'tjust stand there drinking your milk. Get up!
Move! Iùs a bear!
Major!
Go get him. Good.
Good, go get him!
Come on.
- Get him, Major!
- Go away, bear!
Major, go get him!
- Sock it to him!
- Come on!
Yeah!
Good boy.
Good boy, Major.
Major, you saved us!
He sure beat up that old bear.
He's so strong.
Thaùs why they call him
"king of beasts."
Napoleon, wait.
Just try to imagine something nice in your mind.
Iùll stop you thinking about being tired.
All I can think about is sitting down.
I bet we'll be able to see Danny's cabin from the top of this hill.
Chocolate cake with... strawberry ice cream... and marshmallows, and whipped cream, and cherries...
Cake. Apple pie.
Chocolate syrup.
There's nothin'.
[Cries]
- You promised you wouldn't do that.
- I know, but...
My feet hurt, and...
I wish my mom and dad were here.
Do you think we're gonna die?
Die? Of course not.
I know exactly where we are.
Almost.
See those mountains over there?
Those are these here.
We ought to be right about here.
But... they have a lake right here.
I don't see a lake around here.
Do you?
Napoleon, we're lost.
What are we gonna do?
Maybe we are a little lost right now.
But you know... we could stay here for weeks and weeks and live off the land.
- Just like the Indians.
- Could we do that?
Sure.
You're so good at everything.
I really admire you.
I'm sorry I was crying.
Thaùs OK.
Girls can't help it all the time.
You just stay here and rest.
I'm gonna go on a hunting trip.
Hey, you can't leave me here alone.
Major's with you.
- You'll be right back, won't you?
- Sure.
I'll bring back some food too.
Got him!
Shoot.
Huh?
Just me.
Did you get anything?
- Yeah.
- Whaùd you get?
Ewww.
- What is it?
- Snails.
I found them under a rock next to the river.
- You eat 'em?
- Sure. People eat them all the time.
They're really special.
They look horrible.
- Let me see you eat one.
- No, I've already had mine.
I'm not hungry anymore.
I woulÔve rather have had fish.
Well, I caught one.
But I decided to let it go.
But these are better for you anyway.
No, thaùs OK. I...
I guess I'm not very hungry anymore, either.
- Did you see anything?
- No.
I'm gonna go on a scouting trip right now.
- I'm gonna find out where we are.
- Napoleon...
Don't worry. Major's here with you.
I'm just going to the next ridge.
I bet thaùs where Danny is.
- OK?
- OK.
Good.
Major! Now you sit down!
Do you hear me?
Where are you going?
Come back here.
Napoleon!
Major!
Whaùs gotten into you anyway?
You want to get us more lost?
Napoleon!
Napoleon!
- [Napoleon] Danny!
- [Sam] Danny!
Danny! Iùs me, Napoleon!
Hey! Hey, Napoleon! Hey!
[Napoleon] We're coming to visit you.
Danny!
[Sam] Danny, we found you!
Danny, I'm so glad we found you.
You crazy kids.
How'd you get here?
Over the mountains.
Over the mount?
Do you know how lucky you are?
I could have been 100 miles from here.
We were attacked by a bear, and a mountain lion, we got lost...
Wait a minute. What happened?
What about your uncle?
And your parents?
Danny... could we have something to eat?
And some milk for Maj?
Sure. OK. But I want to hear the whole story, all right?
You should have told me the truth about your uncle.
You mean you have no idea where he is now?
- Why can't I come up and live with you?
- Because iùs not that simple.
For one thing, Samantha's here.
Gertrude's probably got in touch with your family by now.
I only wanted to help Napoleon.
I was gonna go home after that.
But in the meantime, they're worried sick.
Iùs all right to do your own thing, but when somebody gets hurt, thaùs something else.
Well, I'm not gonna live in town anymore.
If you don't want me, me and Major will go live up with the Indians like my grandpa did.
Napoleon, iùs not a game.
I like you here.
Iùs just not possible.
But I don't want to go back to any dumb old orphanage.
Orphanage?
Yeah. He's scared of orphanages.
"Orphanage" is like, a dirty word you read in story books.
They're not like that.
Look, there's a lot of kids like you, right, and thaùs too bad, but there's also good, kind people who gather you together and make a family in a nice home.
A place where everybody has friends, and you play games, and you get an education.
School?
Don't knock it.
With no education you're nothin'.
You get an education, you can do anything you want.
The thing you should want to do most now is be useful.
You know what I mean by being useful?
I think so.
Danny, are you useful?
[Laughs]
Well, um...
No, I wouldn't say I'm useful.
Not right now, but, um...
I do other things around here besides tend goats.
I think, and... study, and...
I'll get my master's degree soon.
- Whaùs that?
- Never mind.
The point is, if I can still go to school so can Napoleon.
Later on you can be with the Indians, sea captain, cowboy, anything you want.
But what about Maj?
Major can stay with me, and you can visit him when you want.
All right?
Well, I don't know, Danny.
Napoleon.
Can I think about it?
Yeah, sure.
You think about it.
Danny, what about me?
You?
Right after supper I'll head into town and catch a nap on the way.
In the morning, I'll talk to Gertrude, and we'll get the whole thing straightened out.
Are we going with you?
[Danny] No, sir.
No way. I think once across the mountains is enough.
- I got a babysitter for you.
- [Napoleon and Sam] A babysitter?
[Danny] Yeah. His name's Mark.
Came out of nowhere.
Just like you.
[Napoleon] Where is he?
[Danny] I don't know. In the woods.
He spends a lot of time there.
- I think you'll like him.
- [Roars]
[Danny] He's kind of quiet.
There's...
Mark, you look like you just saw a lion.
Don't worry. He's tame as a pussycat.
Belongs to the kids.
He's really tame.
His name's Major.
Come here, Major!
I'll introduce you to him.
Here, Major!
Hi, Mark.
[Lion roars]
- Yes. What...
- Good morning. My name is Danny...
[Danny] Hey!
Lady, if you're Gertrude,
I have to talk to you.
Just a minute.
I'm alone in the house.
I have to put on a robe.
- You stay right there.
- OK.
Hello, police?
Lady? Iùs important.
Iùs about Samantha.
Gertrude, she's all right.
Can you hear me?
She's OK. I came by to tell you that.
Hello?
All right, mister. Take it easy.
- Whaùs going on?
- Against the door.
- What?
- You're under arrest.
Whaùd I do?
You have a right to remain silent.
If you give up this right, anything you say can and will be used against you.
You got the wrong guy.
You have a right to speak to an attorney during questioning.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Leùs go.
Thaùs him. He's the one, all right.
What did you do with them?
Where are those poor children?
I've been trying to tell you they're OK.
They're up in my cabin.
If you let me explain and listen to me.
The chief will do the listening and talking. Don't cause any trouble.
[Lva] Gertrude!
Is he the one?
He certainly is.
If he's harmed one hair on her head, I'll...
- Iva, will you drive me to the station?
- Indeed I will. Let me get the car.
Give me five minutes.
- That all you got?
- Thaùs all.
The chief will be here in a few minutes.
- Right. Pete, get him printed.
- Come on, this way.
See if there's a make on him.
Right hand first.
Are the kids all right?
Where'd they catch him?
[Lva] Come on, Gertrude, you step right up and tell them about it.
Where are they?
[Policeman] Quiet down, everybody.
I want to know where Samantha is!
Lady. Gertrude...
I keep telling everybody but no one's listening.
The kids are at my cabin.
They're fine.
- I don't know what this is all about.
- Two kids have disappeared, an old man lies buried in his backyard, and you were there.
- Right.
- You got a lot of questions to answer.
Come on, people.
Let the chief handle it.
Leùs move it.
Look, I'm not going anywhere until I know Samantha's safe!
All right, you.
Sit down over here.
You guys are really beautiful.
All you have to do is send somebody to the cabin. This would all be over.
If iùs cool, there's no hurry.
- Leùs wait till the chief gets here.
- We'll do everything by the book.
[Danny] Wait a minute.
- Hey, fella.
- Look at this.
Sit down.
This psycho is with the kids.
He's dangerous. Says it right here.
I'm telling the truth.
We gotta get up there.
Let go of me and listen!
Take it easy!
Wait till the chief gets back.
Iùll be all right.
- Out of the way!
- Watch it!
There he goes.
Go back inside.
Take your car and cover the other side.
Hey, buddy.
[Woman screams]
[Man] Look out!
[Woman] Get out!
[Horn beeps]
Car two, repeat. I don't read you.
[Car 2] He's on a cycle.
Headed north on 27.
Should we set up a roadblock? Over.
Check and advise.
See what you can find out about him.
Is that Pete?
Whatever you do, don't take your eyes off him.
We'll set up a roadblock at Dawson's Ridge.
Put Adams and Suskind on it too.
This could turn out to be a big deal.
If we lose him, he could take off in the brush.
- You want me to call the state patrol?
- Yeah.
And, uh, Chief Thomas at Carsonville.
Leùs get everybody on it.
Notify the airport.
Get a copter ready for me in 10 minutes.
H-C-G, 4-4-0. This is 22.
Request copter. Stand by.
[Sirens]
Slow down!
[Worker] Hey!
[Worker] Hey, fella!
What do you think this is?
A racetrack?
Nut!
[Policeman] Get that dozer out of the way.
Whaùs going on?
[Siren]
[Siren]
There he goes.
Look out.
[Policeman] Are you OK?
[Man] I don't know. Why don't you guys learn how to drive that thing?
Ajeep. Leùs take it.
[Man] Where are you going with my jeep?
Don't worry about it.
[Logger] Easy. Take it away.
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Go ahead.
Look out.
[Horn blasts]
Up there.
OK. We've gotcha. Go ahead.
- Chief, Mike.
- Yeah.
About the escaped psycho, he's a lulu.
- Just give it to me straight.
- Yes, sir.
He escaped ten days ago.
He used to live in Carsonville, so he could be in our area.
- Over and out.
- How do you like that?
- The guy was telling the truth.
- He sure was.
Hey, look!
He didn't want us to nail him till he got us up here.
Take her down quick.
Close to the cabin.
[Policeman] Take it easy.
[Sam] Hi, Danny.
Hi. Whaùs all the noise about?
Sounds like helicopters or something.
[Napoleon] Where did Mark go?
- You kids all right?
- [Napoleon] Sure.
- Hey, it was a helicopter, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
- Whaùs been going on here?
- Just a game.
Then all the noise and Mark ran out like he was scared or something.
We were his prisoners and he was the wicked giant.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
- Nothing's wrong, is it?
- Everything will be all right.
Sam, look, iùs the police.
What are they doing with Mark?
Are they taking him to jail?
No, just to a hospital.
- A hospital?
- [Danny] Yes.
Mark's been sick.
The hospital thinks iùs better if he came back with them.
Gosh.
He sure didn't look sick to me.
You know, he was the best giant
I ever played with.
Goodbye, Mark.
You mean, we get to ride back in a helicopter?
Thaùs what I said. But the lion will have to stay here with you.
For this trip, anyway.
No more, thank you.
We got through to Samantha's parents.
They'll be at the airport.
They're home! Napoleon!
Next time you're in town, stop by my office. I'll serve the coffee.
- Danny, Napoleon's run away again!
- What?
See? There he goes.
[Danny] Let me see.
Maybe I can handle it.
OK.
Napoleon!
Where you going?
I thought we had a deal.
No. I just said
I'd think it over, Danny.
I decided...
I better go live with the Indians.
On account of Maj and all.
There aren't any Indians around here.
- Not anymore.
- Yes, there are. I'll show you.
Just over this mountain.
[Danny] Boy, iùs a big world, isn't it?
Nobody can make it alone.
We all need people to help us.
Mark needs people to help him, and they will.
You'll need people to help you.
Trust them, Napoleon.
Trust me.
Danny?
Well... about the Indians... well...
I meant over the next mountain.
Come on.
Hurry up, Maj.
- Destination, Monsieur?
- Monte Carlo.
Rue, de "boisie-arie."
Au rue Dubec, a droite a place "dee-l-eena."
Will you give it to me in English?
Sure. We're lost.
Thanks.
Hey.
- Herbie.
- What's he doing?
I think he's getting us un-lost.
Hi, there. Say, we're looking for the Trans
France Race Exposition.
Oui, straight ahead on your right.
You can't miss it.
- That's going to be some race.
- Yeah.
Well, you're looking at the winner right here.
This car? The winner?
- He didn't.
- He did.
All of this for the museum payroll?
The most magnificent diamond in the world.
L'etoile de Joie.
Could we have just a little peek?
On this very afternoon, at 1:00, precisely, you and all of Paris will be able to take the peek.
Now, fresh from his triumphs on the European racing circuit,
Bruno Von Stickle...
Who'll be driving his laser 917 GTE coupe.
Here we have a magnificent Pantera...
Ah, I see the American entry is just arriving, Mr. Jim Douglas.
Mr. Douglas will be driving a...
A...
Mr. Douglas will be driving a most unusual entry.
Something funny must've happened.
Huh. Us.
How about giving Jim Douglas and his partner,
Wheely Applegate...
A nice, warm welcome, huh?
This little car of yours is the toast of America.
When was your last win?
12 years ago.
That was only because, that was our last race.
Yeah.
Yes, this race... We're kind of staging a comeback here, and so it's very important to us.
I mean, we won't be coming back very far unless we qualify, will we?
Qualify? Are you kidding?
Don't let his modesty or this little car coming out of retirement fool ya.
There isn't a finer-tuned, cleaner engine anywhere.
I'm sure it should be easy to keep clean.
All you have to do is drop it in the washing machine along with your socks.
Appreciate your humour, but just don't you worry about this little washing machine... Car.
It's a real jewel.
But Monsieur Ribeaux, isn't it too much responsibility...
- For one man?
- One man?
One man and the finest security system that can be devised.
All in the computer.
Now, this alone will keep the diamonds safe from the grasp of a thief.
But, Monsieur, one would only have to reach in and...
The pillow is sensitive to the heat of the hand when it gets close to the diamond.
I'm sorry, Monsieur.
What does that do?
I'm engaging a system of electric eye beams that surrounds the pedestal.
One last precaution, gentlemen.
Would you please step out of the room?
Now the entire floor is a trap.
The mere ashes from a cigar would activate the alarm.
Right on schedule.
Only ten steps to six million dollars.
One step to Devil's Island if anything touches that floor.
Pardon, Monsieur Ribeaux, but you forgot to give me the computer and the numbers.
I did not forget.
They were put in my trust and will remain with me.
One does not part with the only copy in existence.
Patience, Quincey.
Electronics is the answer.
This notebook is our passport to the future.
I think I shall put my trust in this bit of rope.
When the man has it all worked out for us, silly not to use it.
You had to bring the whole kit, didn't you?
I was just checking for the radar beam.
It's there.
Now it isn't.
Some chunk of rock?
One could spend a lifetime without setting eyes on a rock like that.
You'll love getting your hands on it.
Ah.
Patience, Quincey.
Pillow's the trap.
One more set of numbers.
Why can't a man write an "o" that looks like an "o"?
Or is it a "9"?
Can't take a chance.
I don't trust nobody.
I'm glad I come prepared.
The old ways are still the best ways.
We've got six minutes before the guard checks.
Get on with it.
Aren't you ever gonna get that thing fixed?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I...
- Excuse me. Oh, I just...
- Oh.
Jim.
A word to the wise.
Paris may be the land of love, but it can also be the land of heartbreak.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'm willing to resist the girls, if you are.
- Well, that's some sacrifice.
- I know.
But I'm willing to make it.
You're made of strong stuff, Wheely.
Patience, patience, Quincey.
You tell that to the guard.
He'll be here in two minutes.
Give me that.
Well, we're coming into this big right hand sweeper, see.
Dropped him into third gear and really jumped on it.
Took three cars.
Then back into fourth, and we were flying.
Tach-in' seven or eight thousand.
We blew off the lead car 100 yards from the finish line.
Won it going away. How about that?
Je Ne comprens pas, parlez anglais.
I didn't understand what he was saying.
That's okay.
He didn't understand what you were saying either.
Come to think of it, I don't think
I understood what you were saying.
There's no more time.
That guard's practically in the door.
You want that stone, don't ya?
Yeah, and there's only one way to get it.
It's not possible.
Attention.
Attention, everyone, attention.
Nobody is to leave the area. I repeat.
- Nobody is to leave the area.
- We still have to qualify.
Come on.
- What's the trouble?
- I don't know.
Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a theft in the museum.
Everyone will be searched before leaving the area.
I repeat.
Nobody is to leave the area until they have been searched.
Here, mate, there's no point in us both getting caught, is there?
No point in either of us getting caught.
I repeat. Nobody is to leave the area.
I repeat. Nobody is to leave the area until he has been searched.
We'll never see it again.
That little car there?
Indeed you can.
It will be in a showroom on the Champs-Elysées at 4:30 this afternoon.
Yes, yes, yes.
But are you sure all the security precautions had been taken?
I've searched my memory.
Could I have forgotten something?
Inspector, some residue from a footprint.
I might have overlooked it, but I seemed to hear your voice calling out,
"Fontenoy, remember, no clue is too small."
Did you also hear me saying,
"Take it to lab and get it analysed, Fontenoy?"
Yes, sir, and I'm doing just that.
No.
No, I couldn't have forgotten anything.
I am as sure the security was on yesterday as I am sure it's off today.
Fontenoy.
Attention, please.
The qualifying rounds will begin in eight minutes.
- Douglas and Applegate.
- Douglas.
Ah, yes, Monsieur Douglas.
You're in the heat after this one.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
That's the same heat
I'm in, Douglas.
And you're going to need more than luck.
You're going to need wings.
Oh, yeah? Well, you may be in for a little surprise.
I can see your surprise.
It is very little.
Attention...
Look for an even bigger surprise when the race starts.
There will be qualifying today and tomorrow, with the top 16 times running in the Trans France race.
You are not in this heat. Come back.
Say, Herbie, where you going?
Herbie, you could get us disqualified.
He could get us killed.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Forget the music.
Whoa.
He's out of his mind.
He's out of his mind, all right.
Over that luscious little Lancia.
What is...
I'm telling you, Paris and women have got him.
I'm gonna have to warn him the same way I did you.
Like father, like car.
What are you doing?
- Now, wait a minute, buddy...
- What do you mean, "buddy"?
- Miss Buddy.
- You... You...
Yeah, Jim Douglas.
And I'm very sorry.
You think...
That because I'm a woman driver, you can get away with anything you please.
Well, I'm not a pigeon for your fun and games.
I've had it with you clowns.
No, I'm not the clown.
Believe me, it was Herbie.
Oh, yes, you're blaming your dizzy mechanic.
No, no, it's...
Herbie's the car, and he's kinda like a person.
He's... now, I know that sounds funny.
Crazy, is more like it.
Well, what were you doing out there, Douglas?
Well, it's kinda hard to explain, sir...
Not for me, it isn't.
He doesn't want a woman in the race.
Look, Miss Darcy, you'll be given another chance to qualify.
We're terribly sorry.
You're sorry, he's sorry, everybody's sorry.
But I didn't qualify.
Attention, Antonio Vittoro.
If you wish to qualify, Mr. Douglas, you have exactly 10 minutes.
Hear that, Herbie?
You forget that powder puff and get your mind on racing.
You better believe it.
Gilbert.
We're going to cook that chicken, European-style.
When he sticks out his neck,
- we will chop it off.
- Huh. Oui, oui.
Jawohl, jawohl.
We'll see whose neck gets chopped off.
Right, Herbie?
Attention, attention, attention.
You better close your mouth, turkey, because you're gonna get our tire marks right across your teeth.
- Where'd they go?
- I really got snookered.
I'm even rustier than I thought.
Hey. Herbie, what are you doing?
It's her again.
Oh, no.
Well, it took a crowd to do it.
But at least we lost the Lancia.
And not to mention the first qualifying round.
Did you get a hold of Double X?
He wasn't very happy.
Who is? Where is that stupid little car?
Patience, patience...
Oh, excuse me, sir.
There are impressive racing cars here, but I don't seem to see the little Volkswagen.
Ah, you mean the Douglas car. It will be here.
Patience, my friend, patience.
One more person says
"patience" to me, I'll...
We better have it now, because if we don't turn up with that diamond,
Double X is going to mark the spot where we're buried.
Here, here. Don't dig our graves just yet.
Come on, let's grab it.
- Don't tell me, "patience".
- In front of 100 witnesses?
We need a plan.
Attention, everyone. Attention.
We would like to show a film of the route the racing cars will take when they leave Paris.
If someone will catch the lights while I draw the drapes...
I think the gentleman just gave us a plan.
The fine machines you have seen here will be among those testing the gruelling route, stretching through our fair city, twisting through the French Alps...
Back up slowly, as if nothing was the matter.
In the city, the cars will be able to pick up speed...
As they race along the
French countryside.
Only by the challenge that becomes evident...
As we approach the famous French Alps.
It's not here, max. The car's just not here.
Will test the endurance... Of even the sturdiest of cars.
Perhaps we're backing in the wrong direction.
Just keep backing up.
There remains the final dash for Monte Carlo.
And for someone, victory is just a step away.
- Herbie. Excuse me.
- You mean, no Herbie.
Garcon. Garcon.
Garcon.
Excusez moi.
Oui.
- Etes-vous, cuckoo?
- Oui. Cuckoo.
My car. My car. Has anybody seen my car?
- Oh, that was your car?
- Yes, yes. It's gone.
- Yes, it's gone.
- Did you see who took it?
Not exactly, mademoiselle.
Excuse me, I hate to bother you...
You. I should have known I'd see you.
You and trouble go together.
Yeah, okay. Look, we've lost our car...
And I'd just like to know if you'd seen it, by any chance.
Who cares about your silly Volkswagen?
My Lancia has been stolen.
- Stolen?
- Your car?
- And your car.
- Yeah.
- I saw them both.
- Then you saw who stole them.
You would not believe this.
I would not believe this.
- No one would believe this.
- What?
I think they steal each other.
Come on.
Taxi.
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Coo.
Talk about a needle in a haystack.
How are we gonna find 'em?
I don't know. Just keep looking.
My life is riding on that car.
Lady, I got a few things to prove myself.
Where would you take a boyfriend on first night to Paris?
"Boyfriend"?
Don't tell me this is your cute way of making a pass.
If I had romance in mind, would he be along?
Right.
- It's Herbie.
- Herbie. I don't believe this.
Well, it's true.
There's something about that car.
He's got a... He...
Well, we've been through a lot together.
Yeah, well, nothing like this.
Hey. Regardons. Regarde.
Bateaux-Mouches.
Do you think this is something to laugh about?
Forgive me, mademoiselle.
I laugh at the radio.
Two automobiles, they take a ride on the Bateaux-Mouches.
Would you believe such a thing?
Bateaux-Mouches?
Take a left at that bridge.
Maybe I can explain this over dinner tonight.
Maybe not.
I don't know, Herbie. 12 years is a long time.
Hope we can handle it.
Hope I can handle it.
- Well, all taken care of, Jim.
- Yeah?
Had a little talk with Herbie.
Had to straighten him out.
I don't mind having a car that's got a heart, but I will not tolerate a car falling in love with another car.
What did you expect him to fall in love with, the Goodyear blimp?
The Goodyear... Yeah.
Anyway, I said, "Listen Herbie,
"we're here for one thing only.
"And that's to make the biggest comeback
"in racing history.
"So, no women in training camp.
"Just forget that little chick.
"And you can do it.
"Just a matter of mind over metal."
- You expecting company?
- No.
Detective Fontenoy here.
And this is the famous
Inspector Bouchet.
I'm Jim Douglas and this is my partner
Wheely Applegate.
Look, if there's a problem about our car cruising on the Bateaux-Mouches...
Bateaux-Mouches? No, no.
It's about the six million dollar diamond stolen this morning.
Perhaps the most beautiful diamond in all the world.
Fontenoy.
No?
We are questioning everyone who was in the area at the time.
Perhaps you can help us.
Pushing the car won't help me get the cap off.
- Must've rolled.
- Well, pull the hand brake on.
Door's locked.
The window.
Put your hand through the window.
Ooh.
Let me get at it.
I'm gonna hotwire this car.
We'll get the diamond at the garage.
Right.
Well, I'm not waiting.
Car, it's either you... Or me.
Oof.
I suppose you're going to tell me that car started up and drove away by itself.
No, and I'm not going to tell Double X that either.
What's happening?
There's seven cars ahead of us and we're in last place.
That's what's happening.
- Darcy.
- Oui. Qualifying today?
I hope so.
New Herbie? He's not even an old Herbie.
He's not any Herbie at all.
My whole lecture must've fallen on a deaf carburettor.
He doesn't need a lecture.
He needs an old-age pension.
You listen to me, Herbie, and you listen good.
You and I didn't come out of moth balls to be the laughingstock of the continent.
Either get the lead out of your pants right now, or I'm going to ship you back to the states, have you stuffed and hung on a wall in Retirement Village.
Ah.
Ooh. Now you're talking. We got the old Herbie back.
The old Herbie and the new
Herbie, rolled into one.
I'm telling you, it's the old Herbie, and he's doing it for us.
He's not doing it for us.
He's doing it for her.
Okay, so he did it for her.
I never saw anything like that.
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Somebody did it.
- Who cares, Wheely?
It's, "Hello, comeback."
In record time for this track.
You shattered Von Stickle's mark.
Congratulations, Douglas.
You have just won the right to taste my dust tomorrow.
And mine, Douglas.
Today, you break my record.
Tomorrow, I will turn your "Hello, comeback" into "Goodbye forever."
Auf wiedersehen.
Couple of charm school dropouts.
Yeah.
Well, one showboat deserves another.
I'll go get him.
Félicitations.
Absolutely amazing.
I knew I had a good car under me, but...
The exact same time as the Douglas car.
- A track record.
- What?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you for staying off the track.
It's one way I can prove what I can do.
Well, it wasn't exactly you.
You've got a real problem about women in racing, Mr. Douglas.
What is it? We drive too slow... Or too fast?
Oh, I didn't mean that.
It's not you at all, it's your car.
And my car.
Excuse me, I don't want to hear about your car.
No, I have to tell you this.
I know it's gonna be hard to believe, but...
You see, Herbie's not just a car.
I didn't believe it myself at first, but the little guy has actually got a...
He's...
When a car like Herbie comes to Paris, he meets a beautiful Lancia, that is also a car like Herbie, with a, with a...
You know, it's natural that they're gonna fall in...
You're right.
I wouldn't believe it either.
When the men come by from the booby hatch, go quietly.
Just trying to warn you about your car.
Let me warn you about me.
I'm in this race to win, and frankly, I'd like to see...
You and your car disappear entirely.
Oh.
Quincey.
Pull over. We want that car.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna pull over.
Hang on.
Darkness is about to fall upon you.
Amazing.
Whoa.
Hot, hot, hot.
You...
They're still coming.
I think they are trying to kill us.
Mon dieu. Mon die...
I never thought she'd go that far to make us disappear.
Who's that?
That cute little time bomb, Diane.
She set us up to knock us out of the race, just like she said.
Now, wait a minute.
She didn't say that.
Oh, of course not. They never say what they mean.
That's what makes the female of the species deadlier than the male.
You read that some place.
Yes, and I've got a mother, three sisters and two ex-wives to prove it.
They never told me they wanted me out, but every time I came home, the lock was changed.
I don't take that kind of strong-arm stuff from anybody, male or female.
Then somebody better teach this female the rules of the game...
Before the game is over.
If she doesn't know 'em now, she will when I get through with her.
You might as well settle back, Herbie.
Once Jim gets started, nothing can stop him.
Who hired thugs?
I'm just as good as anybody out there on that track.
And I don't need anybody to win my races for me.
We...
That is the trouble with you, all of you.
You don't think a woman can do anything.
Yeah, I know he seems like a quiet sort of guy, but when a fight is inevitable, he never ducks.
"Women are supposed to be nurses
"and secretaries and school teachers."
I've taken that all my life.
I took it from my mother and my father.
And my aunts and my uncles.
But I'm not going to take it from you.
When old Jim gets started,
I hate to get in his way.
He's a regular steamroller.
- Whoa.
- Coward.
I'm a race driver and I can win it on my own.
Oh.
You know, I think you can.
Double X? Yeah.
I'm afraid we-we-we've had another complication.
I'm beginning to think you are the complication.
That...
That item should have been in my hands by now.
Oh, don't worry, sir. It's still in the gas tank.
Then bring me the gas tank.
What are you waiting for?
We've lost them again, sir.
We don't know where they are.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Inspector Bouchet.
Oui, Monsieur.
Impossible.
Are you trying to tell me a couple of simpleminded
Americans...
Ah...
- Disappeared?
- Hold on.
Hope we're not disturbing you, Inspector.
No, gentlemen.
Your timing could not be more perfect.
Good.
I want to thank you for your continued cooperation...
In this matter of the stolen diamond.
Tonight, we're asking for your help.
Somebody's out to get our car.
Ah, that's impossible.
I think they're trying to knock us out of the race.
I was wondering if there's some way, I don't know, we can put the car in protective custody for the night.
That is, if you're not too busy trying to find that diamond.
No, no.
One is just as important as the other, I assure you.
I'll only be a moment.
Oh. I mean...
- We'll wait in the car.
- Good idea.
We wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
Not now.
Hello. The car is here.
Never mind how...
Never mind how.
No, no. It's too risky for me.
I will see to it that the car will be at number 32,
Avenue Mozart within the hour.
Don't get lost on the way.
Your worry is now my worry, gentlemen. Rest easily.
I'll take personal charge of this valuable possession.
- Inspector.
- What is it, Fontenoy?
Off duty or not, sir,
I couldn't sleep, thinking about the diamond...
And how it would be weighing on your mind.
At the moment, Fontenoy,
I have a car weighing on my mind.
Somebody's trying to knock us out of the race.
Well, with your excellent time in the trials, it would not take a master of deduction like Inspector Bouchet...
To see that you have an excellent chance to win.
Which is why I personally will ensure the safety of this automobile.
Now, put your minds at ease.
Get a good night's sleep.
Thank you. You too, Herbie.
A big day tomorrow, pal.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- No, no. Permit me, sir.
- What do you mean?
You have enough responsibility trying to find the diamond.
- I'll look after the car.
- Don't be ridiculous.
What are you doing?
Anything for you and the force.
Get out of the car.
Leave it to me, sir.
I'll keep this little car hidden so no one will find it.
Fontenoy...
My best man.
Huh.
- Good night.
- Good night.
My very best.
We've checked that, sir. It's nowhere.
We've covered the whole city. Now what?
In the morning, before the race, that ridiculous little car will get gasoline.
When it does, you'll be there.
Welcome, everyone, to the inaugural running of the Trans France race.
They're all here: qualifying drivers and cars from the world over, each looking forward, expectantly, for the chance at the magnificent trophy...
And the $20,000 winner-take-all prize.
This promises to be one of the most punishing races ever.
And these drivers know it.
They've no doubt gone through these cars, time after time after time.
And yet, we have them all here, still refining and tuning car after car, each preparing for the gruelling race...
That will test the endurance of man and machine.
I just wish I had a machine to test.
I hope, what's-his-name didn't hide Herbie so well, he can't find him.
I wish you hadn't said that.
I mean, I'm a mechanic.
And a mechanic is nothing without his car.
A million and one details have to be taken care of for a race.
You know me, how I pride myself on being thorough.
My tools. Where's my tools.
Right here.
- I knew that.
- Huh.
Inspector, the race is about to begin. Where's our car?
Believe me, I am as concerned as you are.
But I'm sure Fontenoy will be here.
He's unpredictable, but he's dependable.
What?
Let me check headquarters again.
He'll be here.
You be ready.
Who's that?
He's Double X, you dummy.
Oh, better duck.
Here comes trouble.
Hello.
Hello.
- Look, about last night.
- I know. Me too.
Sorry.
Not about missing me with that vase, I hope.
No, no.
I guess I was a little uptight last night.
Nervous about the race.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I threw a few brick bats myself.
In the wrong direction.
We didn't get off to a flying start, did we?
Herbie and I take a little getting used to.
When you keep including
Herbie like that, you take a lot of getting used to.
By the way, where is... it?
- Well, I...
- Douglas, did you misplace your little car?
Just temporarily.
You should look under a rock or two. You might find it.
No, not under a rock, Gilbert.
Under a gravestone.
Attention, everyone.
All drivers, bring your machines to the grid.
Five minutes 'til race time.
It's just as well, Douglas.
You know the saying,
"They never come back."
- Well, I better go.
- Diane.
Good luck.
I think you mean that.
Drivers will please take your position...
As quickly as possible.
- Well, take the brake off.
- The brake is off.
You know something?
That Lancia's waiting on Herbie.
Well, so are we, and all we need is her hanging around.
All right. Push it, push it.
- No, mademoiselle.
- Listen, I...
I hope you had nothing to do with this.
I didn't, but I think I can tell you who did.
I know, it's your Herbie.
That's right. Herbie's missing and your Lancia's missing Herbie.
You must think I'm an absolute fool with this "Herbie,
Herbie, Herbie."
Well, I don't believe in fairy tales or Herbie or you.
Jim, pop the hood, will ya?
What are you doing?
You want your car started, don't ya?
Listen, I know how you feel, but you better get over it right now.
Forget Herbie.
You know why he isn't here, don't you?
He's found somebody else, that's why.
He didn't have the guts to tell you himself, so I'm telling you.
Oh, yeah, we're talking about the same guy, all right.
Old Herbie. Old fun-loving, fickle, Herbie.
Now you see him, now you don't.
He's right, you know.
So far, we've had to tell this to a Fiat, a Thunderbird and an Austin-Healey.
I know how you feel. It's...
Fun while it lasted, but...
You know, the truth is, you weren't the first and you won't be the last.
You might as well take off.
Will somebody help me start my car?
Yes Miss.
Please. Let me have a look.
Thank you.
No problem.
I was beginning to think everybody around here was crazy.
Well, so much for the Lancia.
Yeah. So much for both of them, I guess.
Douglas, let's go.
Don't you realise you've got pole position?
I also realise we don't have a car.
But it'll be here.
It'd better be. In two minutes, Douglas, or you can try again next year.
Mesdames et monsieurs...
Ladies and gentlemen, the first running of the
Trans France race...
Is about to begin.
What's that?
It's an armoured truck.
That armoured truck is us.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes. Yes.
Where's Herbie? Are you crazy?
We're supposed to be in a race, and here you are guarding the Bank of England...
Or the crown jewels or who knows what.
We didn't travel 6,000 miles just to see some French pastry dressed up like a tin soldier.
I'll tell you something. I've had it with the French...
The men, women and the...
Herbie?
Are we still in it?
From the looks of it, you'll be starting and finishing in last place.
Quickly, you've no time to lose.
You have things to attend to.
- Gas. Let's move it, Wheely.
- Check. Top of my list.
Fill it up.
Monsieur Douglas, stop.
What do you mean, stop?
The tank is full. I filled it this morning.
Let's go, Wheely.
Come on, Herbie. What're you doing? The race is back there.
I know what he's doing.
He can't fool me.
He's looking for that Lancia.
Inspector.
Well, what I was going to say, sir...
Suppose there was a connection between the men who attacked and the men who stole the diamond.
Not now, Fontenoy.
But, sir, what if they've hidden the stolen diamond in the car?
- What?
- If I may suggest, sir, we should have our men search that car immediately.
- Search?
- Yes.
- There is no time.
- The car is still here.
Yes?
Yes, but it is obviously...
Tuning up, or something.
Just say the word, and the men and I...
Will search that car from bumper to bumper.
The word is no, Fontenoy.
No?
What you don't seem to understand is that, a thorough search would take over an hour.
And an hour's delay would deprive Douglas of winning a race...
He has travelled halfway around the globe to enter.
Sir, I admire you for your consideration.
And I understand now exactly how you are thinking.
Sorry, sir.
Forget the Lancia,
Herbie. She's gone.
You heard him right. Gone, split.
Yeah, that's right.
She took off in that race like you never existed.
She wanted me to tell you, it was fun while it lasted, but when push came to shove, she shoved off.
That's just the way women are.
Might as well face it.
You've been deserted, jilted. Abandoned.
Too late now.
We'll get it in Monte
Carlo after the race.
Inspector, I think you will be proud of me.
What now, Fontenoy?
I have done exactly what I knew you would have wanted me to... notified Monte Carlo.
Their police will search the car as soon as it arrives.
I'll take care at once, sir.
Whoa.
Catch anything?
I didn't think so.
- Which way?
- Right.
Left.
Hope they get that trophy to Monte Carlo on a fast jet. We may beat 'em to it.
Unfortunately, somebody put the Alps in our way.
The way Herbie's flying, nothing can stop him, including the Himalayas.
Some road. It's not even on the map.
Maybe you oughta ask directions.
From who, a French mountain goat?
There must be somebody.
Wheely, you...
Maybe I'll just call from in here.
Yeah.
Hey, there's somebody out there.
No, that's just me. I never heard a real echo before.
Will you sit down, Wheely?
Just one more, okay?
Come on, Wheely.
I got somebody.
Those are the guys who were after Herbie.
Get out of the car.
- I'm taking over.
- I'll drive the car.
If it worked once, maybe it'll work again.
Hey, buddy, I like your
"yodel-ay-hee-oo".
Well, we're back on the beam.
How many cars you figure are ahead of us?
Would you believe all of 'em?
Is that a knocking I hear in the gas tank?
Not in my gas tank. Never.
Sounds like something clunking around in there.
Well, we either listen to the driver...
And stop to take the gas tank apart, or we listen to the mechanic and try to win this race.
Well, I'm listening to the mechanic.
Let's go, Herbie.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
The oil pressure's up, there's plenty of gas.
But he's not getting it.
I hate to mention this again, but I heard some clunking...
You mean that nonsense about the gas tank again?
Yeah, that's...
All right, let's get it straight, once and for all, who the mechanic is around here, okay?
You say it's the gas tank, and I say it isn't the gas tank.
You see? It isn't the gas tank.
It's this... Rock that was in the gas tank.
Hold it.
There's only one kind of rock that glistens like that.
Well, sure, quartz.
You can find millions of 'em around any quarry in Philly.
But... Not one that's worth...
Six million bucks.
- Huh?
- L'etoile de Joie.
The tall, the what?
Etoile de Joie.
Oh, wow.
That's...
That's the biggest hunk of diamond
I've ever seen in my life.
What I don't understand is how it...
The black sedan.
- Huh? Where?
- No, no, no.
They're the ones that robbed the museum.
Don't you see?
They weren't trying to knock us out of the race.
They were trying to get this.
Thank you for helping us, gentlemen, and up with your hands.
You gave us the slip for the last time.
We'll take the rock.
I don't suppose you'd believe that was just a big hunk of quartz.
The rock. Let me have it.
Ha-ha-ha.
The rock. Well, come on, hand it over.
Oh. Oh.
Ooh. Ooh.
Well, what do we do with them now?
Thanks, Herbie. We tie 'em up.
Double X, we lost them.
First time we've ever been done in by a car.
The goods will be in Monte Carlo in a couple of hours.
No chance of stopping them.
See, we... We're rather tied up at the moment.
Get me the airport.
We passed every car on the road.
All except the Lancia.
Well, after the way she jilted Herbie, that's one car he won't wanna come in second to.
Right, Herbie?
Hey, isn't that it?
It sure is.
Maybe we should've stopped.
Stop? Are you kidding?
Throw away 100 grand and the biggest comeback of our lives?
We've got this thing.
We're a shoe-in.
- She's in trouble.
- Well, sure, plenty of cars get in trouble.
Let the rescue boys bail her out.
Yeah, but I mean, she could be in real danger.
I'm sorry, Wheely.
Sometimes a comeback comes second.
Herbie doesn't seem to think so.
Well, yeah, sure. Why should
Herbie want to stop...
After the lies you told him back there?
Yeah, the jilted lover.
Why, if he knew that that little Lancia...
Had been waiting on him at the starting line, wouldn't even budge...
Until you lied to her about him throwing her over...
I mean, she... Why, he'd...
I mean, he'd be back at her side right now.
I hate to say this, Jim, but you got a big mouth. You know that?
Hang on, Diane.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You okay?
I think so. I missed a shift and lost control.
That's not all you could've lost.
Herbie, what're you doing?
Herbie, there's no time.
Forget it, Wheely.
He's gonna get his girlfriend out of the mud.
And us out of the race.
I see it, but I don't believe it.
Well, you can believe this, we are now out of the money, because "Sometimes a comeback comes second."
Who's giving up, buddy? Not me.
- Come on, you come with us.
- No, no, I...
I'm gonna stay with my car.
Looks like we're all gonna stay with her car.
Let's go, Wheely.
You're not going any place, are you?
Herbie?
Now listen to me.
Herbie, I know just how you feel, but I also know you're not a quitter.
Now show 'em you can do it, Herbie.
Win it for them.
And for her.
Oh, hey.
The rest is up to you.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Aw, come on, Herbie.
Open up, will ya? Come on.
I know you're sore about what I told you, but I'm sorry, okay?
Look, I did it for you.
Okay, okay, I did it for us.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
Okay.
All right, I lied to ya, and I'm sorry.
And I promise I'll never, never do it again, okay?
Boy, you sure don't forgive easy, do ya?
Bouchet, did you miss a turn on your way to the Eiffel Tower?
No. A little unfinished business, Emile.
You've wounded me, my friend.
You think I cannot handle a little diamond search?
Five of my best men are waiting for the cars to enter Monte Carlo.
- That is exactly why I'm here.
- A-ha.
Afraid I will steal some of your glory?
There is no glory to be stolen.
I wish to rectify a terrible mistake...
And save everyone from embarrassment.
- The search is off.
- Off?
The message was an error by another zealous young detective, anxious to make an overnight reputation for himself.
Ah, yes, but for this kind of news they invented the telephone.
Ooh-la-la.
This is a matter that needed my personal attention.
Who knows what complications could arise from a situation like this?
This is a big race.
It could cause... An international incident.
Ah.
Well, it, seems your young man in Paris...
Has caused you a lot of trouble.
I assure you, Emile,
I intend to put an end to it.
Wiser heads are always called upon to clean up the mistakes of the young.
- It's true.
- And our reward, we get it when we reach heaven.
Perhaps a bit sooner.
Three down and two to go.
Dirty road hog.
Why doesn't he learn how to drive?
He knows how to drive.
That's the trouble.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
If we don't get him by the tunnel...
There's no way we can pass him.
Bruno was right. They never come back.
Herbie.
Ha-ha. I don't b... believe it.
We did it.
They don't come back, huh?
I guess Herbie wasn't listening.
- Whoo.
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.
Ha-ha.
Swine.
Herbie. Herbie.
Herbie. Herbie.
Herbie. Herbie.
How does it feel to be back in the winner's circle?
Pretty good.
Well, for the 20th time, it was a great race, and we enjoyed every minute of it...
Almost every minute of it.
Well, I'm enjoying every minute of this,
I can tell you that.
And, both of us would like to thank you all very, very much.
Au revoir. Arrivederci.
Ciao. Buenas noches.
Sayonara.
Right. See ya around, Douglas.
Hey, that's some cute little memento you got there, old buddy.
Well, this little memento's as much yours as mine, old buddy.
And it's more Herbie's than anybody's.
You can say that again.
Well, look who's here.
May I add my congratulations.
You'll congratulate us even more when you see what we've got for ya.
It was right in Herbie's gas tank.
Ah.
This whatcha been looking for?
Yes.
It's had a rough trip, hasn't it?
But it's winding up in the right hands.
Indeed, it is.
Don't know how we missed connections, sir, but here I am.
Fontenoy.
You see? I knew the diamond would be found.
It's an honour to be at your side in this moment of triumph, Inspector.
And I have more good news, sir.
The two thieves have been captured.
Good.
Good. Then I'd say the case is concluded.
Yeah.
But, you know, there seems there'd be a mastermind behind this kind of thing.
Yeah, or that museum has some pretty lousy security.
Sir, men have been challenged to a duel for such an accusation.
The museum's security was virtually foolproof.
I made an interesting discovery just today, sir.
- Fontenoy...
- From the sensitised floor... to the radar beam surrounding the pedestal to the very pillow on which the diamond rested, all the traps were conceived and executed by one man.
- Fontenoy.
- No, sir.
Give credit where credit is due.
The combinations to the entire security system were devised and known only to you.
The only question is, who besides the inspector knew the details of these precautions?
Who besides the Inspector?
The answer to that question is...
Nobody.
My retirement has been delayed too long.
Now I hope no one will be foolish enough to make a move.
Move this ridiculous car, or
I'll be forced to kill you.
Ah.
Even a mastermind can be outsmarted by this car.
Thanks, Herbie.
Inspector.
I always hoped you'd be present when I cracked my first big case, sir.
Fontenoy.
Excuse me, sir.
Sorry, sir. Sorry.
I think you'll find it's all here, Monsieur.
I'm so happy.
I personally will see to it that this magnificent automobile receives the greatest honour France can bestow.
Please, the, VW?
VW.
Yes, the VW. The white one with the 53 on the side.
Yes, yes, I know the car.
It is the toast of all Monte Carlo.
Yes. It's also our transportation, if you wouldn't mind.
Oh, I wouldn't mind, Monsieur, but it is no longer here.
What?
It was stolen.
Mademoiselle, you would not believe this.
I would not believe this.
No one would believe this.
It was stolen...
By another car.
I know that you believe about Herbie, but you're probably not ready to believe...
Giselle can do anything she wants to.
Giselle?
We're strong women, she and I.
Shall we make it a foursome?
Let's go.
Take us to ze most romantic spot in Monte Carlo.
Well...
Yeah, being chief mechanic is important, but I didn't exactly win the race all by myself.
No?
Well, almost.

You there, which way to Pepperinge Eye?
Couldn't say, sir. lt said on the wireless to paint out the signposts in case the Nazis drop in. l'm not a Nazi! l'm a British officer!
That's what you'd say if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?
Drive on, corporal.
Sorry to give you so many but you do have six bedrooms.
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away from those terrible bombings in London.
What about us?
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.
Charles.
Paul.
You're for Miss Price. l'm expecting her in.
- Call out the navy
- l won't be a moment.
Please don't touch anything.
Call out the tanks
From the Cliffs of Dover,
call up the gulls
And don't forget
the loyal territorials
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
We wrote the story
of the old brigades
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.
Captain Greer, sir, from headquarters at Tidbury, here to check military preparations.
Tell them Pepperinge Eye has matters well in hand.
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?
Good morning, General. l received your message, Mrs Hobday.
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.
How lovely.
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.
Her late father served with me.
What does she burn in this? lt smells like sulphur.
Ridiculous! One can't make motor fuel out of sulphur!
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.
Are we to have the pleasure of meeting him? l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!
Stop it this instant!
Children, this is Miss Price.
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins, all the way from London.
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?
The government are trying to evacuate children into the country.
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.
And l've had to find homes for all of them at very short notice.
These are the last three. All right, children. Pick up your things.
You're not suggesting l take these children into my house?
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.
Children and l don't get on. l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.
Be quiet.
Besides, l have important work to do.
Miss Price, you do have that entire house to yourself.
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice. l see. lf that is the case l shall take them into my house, with the understanding that you find another home as soon as possible.
Fine. Come along.
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable thing you are doing, taking in these poor unfortunates from the city.
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.
My parcel, please.
Bring your things inside.
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Not another house round here for miles.
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone. lt suits my purpose.
All right. Come along, everybody.
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names. l call him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with.
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.
Be very careful of everything in it.
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.
Travel light, that's us. l don't think this is going to work but it seems that l have no alternative.
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?
You will wash yourselves otherwise there will be no supper. ls that clear?
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.
Please don't bother to whisper. l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.
You are planning to run back to London.
Please do your plotting elsewhere where l shan't have to listen to it. l don't know much about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as l do. ls there anything in particular that you fancy?
Sausage and mash, bubble and squeak, toad in the hole, fried fish...
Anything at all.
You won't find any fried foods in this house.
- No fried food?
- No.
How do you keep your health?
Cabbage buds, rosehips, hyssop seed, elm bark, wattle yeast and stewed nettles.
''Dear Madam. With this shipment, the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft sends you its congratulations on qualifying for the first degree of your chosen calling.''
''You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.''
''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''
My first broom.
Time to go. Everybody up.
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.
Let's see how we fly this thing.
Here we are.
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''
Yes, of course.
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.
''A witch is always a lady unless circumstances dictate otherwise.''
''Take an easy, graceful sideways position.''
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.
There we are. How's that?
''To start up the broom, your basic formula:
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!'' l wasn't ready!
Now watch this.
Here we go. lt's going to be a little different this time.
All right. l know it's not ladylike.
What's the matter?
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.
That's the sort of thing witches do.
She don't fly good, do she?
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.
Look out!
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.
A witch she is, says you.
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.
She don't want anyone to know she's a witch, does she?
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.
And l intend to make the most of it. Come on.
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.
Very healthful, l'm sure!
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.
Lovely weather for flying last night.
Why did you say that, Charles?
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are. l see.
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.
Thank you. l should be most grateful if you didn't tell anyone.
Course there would have to be one or two little changes made round here. l mean, l'd like to see an occasional sausage on the table here.
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.
There will be no more of this wash, wash, wash, morning and night.
Anything else?
Now you mention it, l could do with a bit of lolly.
Lolly?
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.
The most accomplished of witches can't make money out of thin air.
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?
Be that as it may, you don't want us to blab, do you?
Have you considered what danger you might be in? l am a witch, you know.
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.
Very well, Charles.
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.
She can't even ride a proper broom.
Excuse me, Charles.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Oh, Charlie!
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!
Bother! l never seem to be able to manage toads.
Stop! Leave him alone!
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long. l'm just an apprentice witch.
Look out, Charlie!
You flaming brute! l'll teach you to do that to me!
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault. l'm afraid it's my fault.
Bad enough not being able to manage a broom. l can't perform a simple, basic spell.
You dared her to do it. l don't see why we can't all be friends.
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
Of course l'm not!
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.
You see, the work l'm doing is so important to the war effort.
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.
Most secret.
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.
Yeah. lf someone made it worth our while. l don't follow.
Simple. You give us something valuable to seal the pact.
Oh, Charlie, don't try to be clever again. lt's for our own protection, ain't it? lf we broke the pact, we'd have to give back the valuable object. l think it's an excellent idea. l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?
Bet that's not worth much.
Come with me.
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.
Well, l never had a rabbit.
Careful what you touch in here.
Rum sort of place, ain't it?
When l signed for my witchcraft course there was a free bonus, a marvellous travelling spell if you paid in advance. l think l'll give you that one.
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.
Poisoned dragon's liver?
You mean you poison the dragon or just the liver? lt comes prepared. lt's part of the school equipment.
Here we are. The travelling spell.
Everybody gather round.
All right now. Let's see.
Does any one of you have a bracelet or a ring?
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.
Never know when they might come in useful. Piece of blue glass.
Lovely bit of string.
Horseshoe nail.
What's that?
Knob from the bed upstairs.
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.
Yes, l think that will be all right.
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit, will you?
Hellebore, henbane, aconite... glow-worm fire, firefly light!
There. lsn't that pretty? ls that all we get?
This knob will now work the famous travelling spell.
And what's the famous travelling spell?
- How does it work?
- You take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs.
Then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left then in a firm, clear voice, tell it where you want to go and the bed will take you there.
Go on!
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the only one who can work the spell.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's right. My knob, weren't it?
That's the way the spell works.
Nice mess he'll make of things.
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.
Don't try anything with the bedknob till l get back.
''Dear Madam, it grieves me to inform you that we have been forced to close down our College of Witchcraft.''
''This means that we shall not be sending you the final lesson in which you expressed so much interest.''
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news. ls there anything we can do?
No. No, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.
Come with me, Paul.
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem to have to explain this to a six-year-old,
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead. l was expecting a very important spell in the mail from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.
What's that got to do with my knob? l must go to London immediately and see Professor Browne.
With his help, we may be able to bring this war to a successful end.
That is why l need the knob.
What is your decision?
Thank you, Paul. l brought this for your hair. lt may be windy.
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?
- Twice.
- Good.
Charles, put on something warmer.
The bed may travel quite fast. l'm not going. l'm staying right here.
But why?
All that rubbish about a travelling bed. lt won't work. That's why.
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.
We don't want to scratch the wall when we take off.
How's a ruddy big bed like that gonna get out of this room with those little windows? l don't know. There's a great many things about magic that l don't know.
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!
Just leave me out of it. l don't fancy making a fool of myself.
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.
Help me tidy up. We don't want to go to London with an unmade bed.
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve. l see. That's what my father used to call the age of not believing.
What's that supposed to be?
When you rush around
in hopeless circles
Searching everywhere
for something true
You're at the age of not believing
When all the make-believe
is through
That's Charlie to a tee.
When you set aside
your childhood heroes
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf
You're at the age of not believing
And worst of all you doubt yourself
Throw that away.
You're a castaway
where no one hears you
On a barren isle in a lonely sea
What's that? Poetry?
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
Everyone on the bed who's going.
You must face the age
of not believing
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob.
Until at last you start believing
There's something wonderful in you
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.
Repeat after me.
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...
Very good.
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.
..of Witchcraft, London.
When l say go, tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left.
- Left...
- That's it.
We'd better hold on tight.
The behaviour of the bed is something l'm not sure of.
Let me breathe a little.
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.
One... two... three...
- ls this London?
- Course it is!
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't. l don't see no Professor Browne.
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again. lt didn't work. lt was supposed to take us to Professor Browne.
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round, please.
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne. l am here to divert, to amuse, and, yes, even to help you.
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are... lt is what they seem to be. ls that not so?
That ain't the kind of professor l expected. l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.
What effect a little smoke is... with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning... and the scent of burning sulphur in the air.
And now, for my next trick, may l draw your attention to this solid piece of ordinary window glass, framed in an ordinary unprepared frame.
May l also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.
Now l shall place the framed glass in this brown, unprepared...
Unprepared, mark you...
Unprepared brown paper bag. l shall now attempt to drive the steel nail through the glass without breaking the glass.
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.
We shall see.
He ain't very good, even if he is a professor. l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.
Don't leave now and regret lost opportunities later.
You, young sir. Would you care to warble like the storied nightingale?
With this inexpensive device, you can charm the very birds down from the trees, like so.
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.
One copper coin of the realm.
Carrie, l'm very surprised at you wandering off like this.
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.
Don't work. l've been cheated! ls that Professor Browne? lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?
Would you be interested in the mating call of the Brazilian bird of love?
Very useful, eh?
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.
Professor Browne, l am one of your pupils.
My dear lady, you are indeed an ornament to the college.
- Splendid.
- Not at all. l was shocked when you closed down the college without that most important last lesson. l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.
But l must have the spell that comes with the last lesson!
The matter is closed. l bid you good day. l have an appointment at my club.
The matter is not closed!
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!
Here we are.
Will you get this child off my leg?
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Now l trust you'll behave more like a gentleman.
Look out!
There goes another rabbit.
What was all that about? l changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells.
My spell? From my school?
Not one of your best spells. lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.
But l don't understand. My spell?
They were just nonsense words from an old book.
They worked perfectly well for me.
They work for you?
Good woman! Some kind of destiny has brought us together.
You got these spells out of some old book, you say? l changed them round a bit. l gave them a bit of my own style, as it were.
The old sorcerers did have a bit of a tendency to waffle on.
But dear lady, l never thought l'd meet somebody like you.
What a treasure.
Mr Browne, will you please stick to the point. l would like to see this book immediately.
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.
Would you care to join me for luncheon?
We can discuss my ideas at the same time.
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.
You go round the other side. l always travel on the left.
Will you give the address to Paul, please?
May l ask how we are going to get there on this bed? Fly?
My dear Professor, with your own travelling spell.
The one you gave with the course as a bonus.
My travelling spell?
That works as well?
Just give the address, please.
8 Winchfield Road.
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.
Madam, is this vehicle safe?
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps, but then most good spells are.
We're here. l would never have believed it.
You must have given us the wrong address. Do you live here? ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate. l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.
Why should they do that?
This probably has something to do with it.
Merciful heavens!
You should be terrified at the very idea of living here.
You would have thought so. l am by nature a little bit of a coward.
But then l pondered. ln the perverse nature of things, this diabolical object is probably the best friend l've ever had. lt enables me, for the first time in my life, to live like a king.
Shall we go in?
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise, but with a charming touch of innocence.
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?
Dear lady, you are relentless.
The book is in the library. We shall proceed there after our cheese and wine.
Why do you keep the curtains closed?
So that we may enjoy the gentle glow of candle light.
More likely so's a copper don't peek in and catch you hiding out here.
Why don't you have a look round the house?
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.
Remember, this house does not belong to Mr Browne.
Mr Browne, where is that book? l must have that spell on substitutiary locomotion.
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.
Would you hold this, please?
What do you think of that?
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.
Think how successful l could be with an assistant who can really do magic.
Dear lady, have you ever considered entering show business?
- The what business?
- The theatre!
Pantomimes, village fairs, the seaside.
Brighton, Blackpool, follies on the prom. l have very important work to do.
Listen to me. We could make a packet.
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift
But I can speak the jargon
That will give your gift
the needed lift
You possess the know-how
And I command the show-how
Oh, how successful you could be
With me l'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
All you need to succeed
in your plan
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
And I'm your man
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman
I sell things that nobody can
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest
I'm your man
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine
Will you stop?
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
What are you reading?
''lsle of Naboombu.''
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.
These pictures prove it, don't it?
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things. l like it.
Now where is the book?
Well? Where is it?
At last, Mr Browne!
''The Spells of Astoroth.''
Of course.
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.
Does one's nose have to twitch like this?
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.
Miss Price, a word about your tactics. l don't mind being changed into a hawk or a tiger or something with dash.
But always a fluffy white rabbit? lt's intolerable!
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.
''The ancient art of...''
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are...''
But the rest of the book is missing!
Now you see why l closed down the college.
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book? l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.
He claimed that l'd given him a dud coin. l ask you!
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.
He got one half and l got the other.
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.
But if it still exists, there's only one place to find it.
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything

Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars

Two bob a dozen, would you say?
- Waterford crystal

Very interesting, but where do they sell books?
There's a little place around the corner.

What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road
There's another bookstore along here somewhere.
You don't expect to sell a piano like that, do you?
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.

Hey, governor. Something for the lady friend? Nylons?
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?
Now you have my undivided attention.
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.
He wants to see you. You too.
Who is the Bookman? And what right has he got to order me about? l think we'd better ask questions later.
Excuse me.
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.
Why didn't you bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne, and half the Household Cavalry as well?
What's the bed for? lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.
Except for this knob, which is mine.
Bookman, there's been bad blood between us long enough.
Let this gift begin friendship anew.
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug. lsn't that the section of the manuscript we've been looking for?
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.
A charming young woman of my acquaintance.
Miss Price, l've been looking for this other bit a long time.
Mr Swinburne told me you were in the market making enquiries.
And here we are. l don't mind saying, to see it all together at last...
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne. ls that clear? lt's all like a jolly detective story or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?
We're both after the same spell.
You have one clue, l have the other.
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing seems to be for us to cooperate. l assume you're looking for the same thing l am.
May l?
This is quite a moment for both of us.
''Substitutiary locomotion, the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.
Here we are.
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are... engraved on the star that was always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''
But where are the words of the spell? l assumed they'd be in your half of the manuscript. l thought they'd be in yours!
Once again, a dead end. l shall never know the secret. lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.
Pity it's so small you can't read the writing.
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages in search for the spells that would make them more like humans.
The legend is that finally the animals rebelled at the experiment, killed Astoroth and stole many of his powers. lncluding the star with the spell on it.
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away and were never heard of again.
However, there is a final notation in my half of the book saying that in the 1 7th century a shipwrecked lascar was taken from the sea half mad with thirst and exposure to the sun.
Before he died, he swore he had seen an island ruled by animals.
Where?
There is, l regret to say, no such island. l looked for it in every chart.
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist. lt does too! Got my own...
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!
When he don't say nothing, he mumbles. l wish the child to speak!
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Please don't annoy me.
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it? lf it's all the same to you, l'd rather use my own.
Sentiment, you know.
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.
Observe the fundamental weakness of the criminal mind.
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.
He's up to something, you know.
Before your very eyes, l shall cause this bed and the occupants on it to disappear. l should like to see a cheap-jack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.
Bed, take us to the lsland of Naboombu.
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!
Beastly climate. l never did fancy the sea.
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course. l've never seen no island like this before. l'm afraid we may have fallen into the lagoon.
That's right.
Here we are on page three.
Oi, Mr Codfish!
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.
Not too bright, is he?
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.
Mr Codfish, where is the lsland of Naboombu?
You mean the land part? Oh, that.
Straight up. You can't miss it.
None of my business, of course, but l shouldn't go there if l were you.
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.
Trouble or not, we should be getting along.
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush? lt's really rather splendid down here. For you, my dear.
Thank you.
How pleasant...
Bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants and creatures
of the deep
We glide
Far below the rolling tide
Serene
Through the bubbly blue and green
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod
Think we're rather odd?
It's fun to promenade
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Look!
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants
and creatures of the deep
It's grand
When you're dancing on the sand
Each glance
Bubbles over with romance
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along through the water
Where we get along swimmingly
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny
Beautiful briny sea
Bravo!
Most exciting, most exciting.
You've won the ruddy cup.
Help!
This time l really caught a whopper!
People! Oh, no!
What scurvy luck.
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain. l used to be a bit of a seafaring man myself.
Many's the time l've shipped out of Portsmouth.
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.
Now stow it, mate.
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading? lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.
That means l've got to throw you all back. That's what to do.
Wait it minute! lt says here that anybody can see the king.
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?
Here in my book.
So it do.
But if you people knew what was good for you, you'd get yourselves all throwed back.
The king don't like people!
Nonetheless, we must see the king on an urgent personal matter.
Please lead the way.
But just don't say l didn't warn you. See?
Follow me.
Get out of here!
Yes. What can l do for you? l caught some people down at the sea lagoon.
They want to see the king.
Really? Well, we can't be bothered with that sort of thing now, can we? l don't know that l fancy this.
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer, l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.
No, no. You don't understand.
As everyone knows,
His Majesty is the world's greatest soccer player.
But due to a technical problem, the Royal Cup match cannot take place today.
And His Majesty had so set his heart on it!
Throw these... creatures back into the sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a moment! l can help!
Do you really think so? l'd be most grateful.
Do you know soccer?
Do l know anything about soccer?
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.
Three seasons with Manchester United...
Yes, yes. You'll do.
Come this way, please.
Mr Browne, are you certain you'll be all right?
Now what?
Not an ideal person in many respects, but Mr Browne is a very brave man.
Do you think he's done for?
Do you think so? l can't tell you how l appreciate this.
For some reason we have great difficulty finding referees round here. lf there be one thing we like, it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!
What's he got round his neck?
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.
Ah, yes.
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.
The Star of Astoroth!
You're to sit in His Majesty's royal box.
No littering, no chewing, no fruit or wrappers or sweets. Please.
Rise, please.
Loyal fans, this is official.
We have a volunteer referee.
Let the match begin!
He's still wearing it!
Right, Dirty Yellows, let's have a clean game.
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.
Weird sort of game they play here.
Hurry up! Get rid of it!
Gracious!
You're doing fine, matey.
Move it around.
Get on with the match!
- Foul!
- They're only animals.
That's no excuse for dirty football.
Ref, are you blind?
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.
The king makes them up as he goes along.
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he's moving.
Steady, matey. Move it around.
He almost had it then.
Looks like he's done for this time.
Don't just stand there! Head it in!
Stop... that... ball!
Goal!
Game's over. l win.
Let me give you a hand, matey.
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.
Please, let me help you on with your robe.
Why, yes. Thank you.
Can't have you catching cold, sire, can we?
Why, no.
Have you ever heard of something called the gypsy switch?
No, can't say that l have.
Remind me to tell you about it some time. l can't tell you when we've had such a good time.
We'll carry your memory in our hearts for a long while. l think it's time to leave.
Must you go?
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
Friendly lot.
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?
Your Royal Star!
They've stolen your Royal Star!
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you think this is?
Why didn't you say so?
Paul, put the knob on the bed.
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee. l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.
Got it.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work. l shall never get used to this thing.
Will you push the bed back into place, please? l think we could all do with a nice cup of tea.
No time. l've gone to a lot of trouble to find this spell. l'm going to try it immediately.
Mr Browne, kindly let me have your shoes, please.
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for? lf you'd been paying attention l should think you'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own. l must have inanimate objects to experiment with.
Makes sense, don't it?
Stand back, everyone. l need plenty of room. l want you all to be absolutely quiet.
Mr Browne, you have the Star of Astoroth, l believe.
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky. lt's all right, Mr Browne. l should have realised that it would be impossible to take an object from one world into another. lf only l would have had the sense to remember the words on that star.
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.
Why don't you and l nip out and get something for supper?
And l might conceivably call into the pub for a pint to steady my nerves. l do know the words, Miss Price.
How can you know the words when Miss Price doesn't?
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.
The prime minister
has told the nation
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.
That was the news. l might have been able to do something about this. lt's out of your hands now, my dear. lf only l could have remembered those words. lt's maddening.
Why don't someone ask me?
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember those kind of words.
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee''?
- How do you know that?
- Easy.
Says so right here in my book.
You mean it was there in your book all the time?
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Nothing happened!
Am l doing something wrong?
Well, it does seem a bit old-fashioned.
After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Substitutiary locomotion
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see
Substitutiary locomotion come to me
Now!
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
I don't want locomotiary substitution
Or remote intransecory convolution
Only one precise solution is the key
Substitutiary locomotion it must be
Substitutiary locomotion
Lovely substitutiary locomotion
You've made substitutiary history
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee
Mr Browne, what is going on here? l haven't the foggiest.
How do you do?
Shall we?
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear? l'm not responsible for its behaviour.
Obviously not, my dear.
Paul, what on earth are you doing?
Having a jolly good time, that's what.
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.
But we must do something.
Didn't l give you my all-purpose cut-off spell?
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!
Mr Browne, will you please control your shoes?
Dear lady, l very much fear that we have nothing under control.
Do you mind?
Now, who would like some more of my lovely sausages and mash?
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie? l've already had two helpings.
- l'm full.
- Me, too.
At least somebody wants some.
Cheer up, my dear. This should be something of a celebration. l'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be much to celebrate.
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.
You just need a little more practice.
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the spirits like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice and a touch of genius.
Never happened to me before. l don't usually juggle with cats under my feet.
Look! She's laughing!
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear. l've just come by to bring you the good news.
Mr Bistlethwaite, who brings the milk, you know?
He's promised to take the children in!
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.
Put a bit of colour back in their cheeks.
Why, what's the matter? l thought you'd be pleased.
You told me yourself that you had no time to take care of children.
Circumstances have changed somewhat.
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?
Of course. You do want him to stay with us, don't you, Miss Price? l suppose l hadn't really thought about it.
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne? lt's all rather sudden! l don't quite know what to say.
Then l'll leave you two to talk it over. l'll come back in the morning!
Good night! lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going to be our father now, aren't you?
We are rather rushing things, aren't we?
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things besides you children to think about.
Yes. As a matter of fact l should have left ages ago. l must get a train back to London tonight. lt's rather an important matter. l'd like to tell you about it, but it's a little bit hush-hush.
Sort of a secret.
Well... if... lf l've been any sort of help to you, l'm pleased.
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you. l've enjoyed being with you.
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope that we shall meet again.
Some day.
When all this war business is over.
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.
Eglantine and Emelius: illusionists extraordinary!
Just think how that will look on the poster.
The children are going to miss you.
- You really think they will?
- Yes.
Well, l shall miss you. All of you. lf l don't go now you might never get rid of me.
Goodbye, Carrie.
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Do you want me to come down to the station with you?
No, no. You stay here and look after everybody.
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.
Good night.
Out you go, Cosmic.
Hello?
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy
in that house at this very moment?
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,
and a coward.
No, Fräulein, this is not the invasion, just a little exercise.
A minor raid to induce panic and to spread a little mischief.
When you English get it through your head that the German forces can land whenever and wherever we please, perhaps you will consider reasonable peace.
Not bloody likely!
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him. l must say, it's very tempting.
Colonel, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit? l said, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit?
Be quiet, please.
Filigree, apogee, epogee...
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.
Would you kindly fetch my notebook from the workroom?
Righto.
Silence!
We have work to do. l am sorry, but l must send all of you some place where you will no longer be a nuisance.
As the words sell the tune
And the moonbeams the moon
All I need to succeed in my plan
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
Eglantine!
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.
Confound it, can't women ever learn to file things properly?
Here it is.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.
Filigree... apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Come along. For once in your life, you've got to believe in something.
That's it. Good lad.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
What's the use of putting us in that draughty castle? lt's quite chilly.
The colonel believes when a British female decides to become a nuisance, she can become the greatest nuisance in the world, and l'm inclined to agree with him.
You need a lesson in manners. lf l had my notebook, l'd make certain you'd learn a few.
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!
Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.
We could strip him down and grease him with soap.
No, it's no good. We can't do it. l could have told you that in the first place. lf we can't get Paul out we'll just have to think of something else.
What about that spell that makes things move about?
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things? l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!
He's on his way to London.
Mr Browne? lf you are Mr Browne, would you get off my lap? lt is Mr Browne! lt is you!
You didn't think that l could do that spell, did you? l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?
What's wrong with the substitutiary locomotion spell?
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.
We can't let these so-and-sos get away with their beastly little raid.
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
Let's hope you haven't forgotten the spell.
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.
Probably not magic, but it might make you feel more at home.
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.
Treguna... mekoides... trecorum... satis dee.
Look!
Sound the advance!
Just in time for the kick-off.
Steady on the left.
Victory for England and St George!
Like a Lord Mayor's show!
Pikemen, hold your distance.
Treguna mekoides
and trecorum satis dee
Blimey!
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.
Come on, lads! After me.
Good shooting, bowmen!
Well caught, sir. Very good.
Knock his block off! That's it!
Mr Browne, make those children take cover!
Are you still there, Colonel? l thought you'd be on your way by now.
You see? Things may not be so easy for you after all.
Goodbye, Colonel!
Eglantine.
Dear Mr Browne.
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.
There they are, lads! l said something was afoot!
All right. Drive them into the sea.
Firing positions. Both sides.
All right, men. Hold your fire. l think we've taught the Hun a lesson.
He'll think twice before coming back here again. lt's tragic. All your spells, your equipment. All gone.
Still, l was able to perform some small service first.
That mean you ain't gonna be a witch no more? Never?
No, Paul. l realised some time ago that l could never be a proper witch.
Was it that first magic moment when you laid eyes on me?
No. lt was the day my poisoned dragon's liver arrived. l knew that anyone who felt the way l did about poisoned dragon's liver had no business being a witch.
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so. lt's much too dangerous being a civilian.
Take care of yourself, guv. l'll do that. And l'll be back before you've grown an inch taller.
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.
Well, here we go.
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.
Parade, by the right, quick march!
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.
Still got this, ain't l?

Come on, boys.
Hey, Captain, why the haste?
The city will not vanish.
It is not the city of Charak he wishes to see, but someone who dwells within.
After a long voyage it's good to stretch one's legs.
The only good thing about this port is the inn of Abu Jamil.
I have been dreaming of his roasted sheep's eyes.
- And I of the eyes of his daughter.
- You're dreaming of more than her eyes.
- Captain, my mouth is dry.
- Let's sample the wines of Charak.
- My thirst is of a thousand men.
- If you drink, you'll go no further.
- Remember the last time?
- You were stripped of your possessions!
Because of that I added four more eunuchs to the population.
Allah be with you.
All the paradise I seek is here.
Who wants anything more?
I shall stay behind.
All silent, no sound, no lights...
A city of ghosts.
- Why is the gate closed?
- Curfew is not until midnight.
No sentries about.
Ho there! Captain of the watch!
Open the gate!
- Wake, wake, wake, wake!
- It's Sinbad, friend of caliph Kassim!
And a better friend to the Princess Farah!
- Captain Sinbad.
- You know me?
I am a merchant. I hope to purchase some of the cargo you'll unload tomorrow.
No one is admitted to Charak after sunset.
- But why?
- The plague. Many have died.
Every time we reach this port some misfortune strikes us!
- The caliph Kassim and his sister?
- They're well. But he's not caliph yet.
I was told in Jerash that
Kassim's father died three months ago.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
- We'd better return to the ship.
- Yes, let's sell our cargo elsewhere.
I'm not leaving Charak until I see Princess Farah and Kassim.
- Is there another way into the town?
- No.
But if you wish to take the risk you may enter at daybreak.
Until then I can offer to relieve your disappointment.
My tent has wine, food and music.
My people are your servants.
Please, be welcome.
Come.
Hassan, don't drink!
The wine is poisoned. Help Aboo-Seer.
Who are you?
Why have you tried to poison us?
From the depths of the earth,
I command you: Arise!
Destroy them!
Kill Sinbad!
Everyone back to the ship!
Captain Sinbad! ...Wait.
Princess Farah!
Quickly.
Praise to Allah that I found you.
I must talk to you.
Not here, not now.
And no going back that way.
Come with me.
Keep rowing back to the ship!
Keep rowing, keep rowing!
Make for the open sea!
- Hoist the mainsail... do it!
- But the shoals, Captain.
We will risk them, there is a full moon.
We'll lie offshore and not return until daybreak.
- You will go back?
- At dawn.
Warm yourself.
Here, take this.
Drink this.
You were searching for me. Why?
I was told of your return.
I need help desperately.
- My brother is in great danger.
- Prince Kassim? I owe him my life.
A spell has been cast upon him.
My uncle Balsora will tell you.
- Why not you?
- I beg of you, do not leave Charak!
- Trust me for my brother's sake.
- For him I would risk my life.
For you... I would give it.
- I was told there was plague.
- Not true.
Balsora rules the city by day... but by night fear rules Charak.
- People whisper of witchcraft.
- How can I help?
- You will find a way.
- Come... lie down.
- I prayed every day for your return.
- It's been almost a year.
- I was not willing to give up the sea.
- Nor I my life at court.
- Now I've decided to live on land.
- And I to live at sea.
I have returned to Charak to ask Kassim for your hand. Will you consent?
Willingly.
But only when my brother is able to stand before you and give his consent.
- When he is himself again.
- Himself?
After my father's death,
Allah protect his soul...
The astrologers had decided that the first full moon would be auspicious -
- for the coronation of my brother.
On the day of the ceremony, the procession began, -
- but even as the crown was being placed upon his head...
Lie back.
It was the last time I saw him as the Kassim I've known all my life.
Young, handsome... a true prince.
You talked of a spell...
- Or has he fallen victim to the plague?
- Worse than a thousand plagues!
Do not talk of it now.
Hassan, where is the Captain?
- What is it?
- His Excellency is here!
The Vizier Balsora.
Ask the princess to come on deck.
- Excellency.
- Captain... welcome again to Charak.
There she is... may Allah's name be exalted.
I prayed that Princess Farah might reach you safely last night.
- Has she told you?
- Yes, this morning.
But is it true, Excellency?
Let's go on board.
My beloved child.
Praise be to Allah you are safe.
Hassan, food and drink for our guests.
The rest of you, back to work.
- You have told him of our misfortune.
- But is it true, Excellency?
Tragically, horribly.
We have consulted all the wisest men and skilled doctors.
- They can do nothing.
- Come. Sit down.
You have travelled to many lands, help us.
- Perhaps there is someone somewhere.
- I will do all in my power to help.
But this requires skills far greater than mine.
It needs an understanding of the black arts, a great alchemist, a magician.
Wait... Yes, I have heard of such a man, if he still lives.
- Who?
- A Greek.
Some say the wisest man in the world.
His name is...
- Hassan, you remember.
- Melanthius! The hermit of...
- Maroof?
- Casgar.
A remote haunted island.
- Have you been there?
- No.
His deeds are legendary, but he may not even exist.
The island is ringed with deadly reefs.
- You must take us to him.
- It would be dangerous.
I cannot allow you to go.
Unless Prince Kassim is crowned before the passing of seven moons, -
- he will lose forever his right to be caliph.
- Melanthius is our only hope.
- Some say he's mad.
The island savages eat human flesh and worship him.
I will send treasure.
Gold and precious jewels for you, your crew and Melanthius, -
- if only he can restore my nephew.
Should I undertake this voyage, it would not be for gold or jewels, -
- but for a treasure far more precious.
Oh, my beloved son.
May Allah preserve you.
Keep those horses steady!
- Who is that?
- Zenobia, my stepmother. She hates me!
- She was not at court.
- My mother died when I was born.
It is said Zenobia is a witch and willed her death.
Allah protect us! Why is she here?
Be on your guard, Sinbad, she's more dangerous than a scorpion!
Queen, may Allah's blessings be on thee.
We meet at last, Captain.
What brings you back?
To deliver my cargo... and to visit my friend Kassim.
- And his sister?
- I am bound by love to them both.
I intend to ask the caliph Kassim for the hand of Princess Farah.
There's no caliph to consent to your marriage.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
Nor is he likely to be.
I have been told of the events at the coronation.
I shall help if I can.
Kassim is beyond help.
Do not be blinded by love.
Balsora must be made to understand no one can help him.
- I shall tell him.
- Do not provoke her!
Why do you interfere?
You can do nothing for Kassim.
- Captain Sinbad can help us.
- I implore you, be silent.
What can you do -
- when they've consulted all the wise men, doctors, priests, astrologers?
- There may be another.
- No one! Abandon this false hope.
- Kassim is doomed forever.
- You lie. You want him doomed.
Within the passing of seven moons, if Kassim is not crowned caliph, -
- he will lose his right forever.
You bewitched him.
You want your son Rafi to be caliph!
Let me cut the smile from her face!
Let me go!
You'll bring an eternal curse on us -
- if you draw one drop of blood from any member of the royal family.
It's only for that she hasn't murdered Kassim!
As cunning as a snake, as malicious as a shark. Rafi will never be caliph!
- There is no one to prevent it.
- Melanthius will prevent it.
Melanthius is a myth and his powers are a legend. He does not exist.
We shall soon discover if the myth and the legend exist. We sail tonight.
My beloved, may your days always be blessed.
Sail for Rhodes or Tripoli, you'll find richer cargo there.
Set sail in search for Melanthius and you'll set a course for damnation!
Aboo-seer, Hassan, Bahadin.
Prepare the ship for sea.
Order your men to bring treasure for Melanthius.
We sail for Casgar.
One thing I advise...
Set a careful watch on Zenobia.
I will have my men watch her castle by day and by night.
Zabid will be in command.
He's the best soldier I have.
My son, Sinbad has agreed to help them. We must act quickly.
He has taken them to the Isle of Casgar to consult the great sage Melanthius.
- Is the heart ready?
- Yes.
You said no one can help Kassim.
Exquisite, my son.
If Melanthius truly lives, he is the one person who could.
You promised me. I am to be caliph. You swore Kassim would never inherit Charak!
- I shall prevent it.
- How?
Sinbad has a ship, a crew.
Balsora has the palace guards.
We shall have other forces at our command.
More powerful than a palace guard and a lovesick sea Captain and his crew.
That... will be our army.
Quickly as you can.
We must be away before nightfall.
- Take that box in my cabin.
- Carefully, I implore you!
It's a baboon!
What a beautiful specimen.
Get back to work or I'll make baboons of you!
Does he do any tricks, Princess?
There, there...
They mean no harm.
O brave and proud bull -
- whose mighty heart my son has fashioned of purest gold.
Beat... with the power as only I command you.
I made it perfect in every detail.
O mighty Abu Salem... you who rule over a thousand devils, -
- by all the fires of hell and darkness, -
- give strength and life to this your creature.
Minaton... Minaton...
Perfect!
A colossus of bronze... and mine to command.
- Hear anything?
- Nothing.
Keep awake! Orders are to keep a watch on Zenobia's castle.
Or I'll slit your throat.
The wind is dying.
A baboon that can play chess?
Go away!
- He's frightened of you.
- I'm frightened of him.
He attacked me.
Baboons can turn savage, you know.
He is not savage!
I command you to go away.
Is he a gift for the wise man of Casgar to play chess with?
Go away!
Hassan, get back to your work.
- But Captain, the beast was playing...
- ...chess, he has beaten me twice.
He is not really a baboon.
He was transformed by the black arts of Queen Zenobia's witchcraft.
He is... Prince Kassim.
Can you be certain that it is not the princess -
- who has been bewitched to believe this animal is a prince?
He is my brother.
Look!
I am Kassim.
Now do you believe?
What is it?
What could it be?
A ship that moves without sails!
He seems to be rowing for six men.
Come on, let's try to get aboard.
Hurry, it's moving out to sea.
A fishing boat.
Spies of Balsora!
Minaton...
Wheel head into them.
It's Zenobia!
For the love of Allah, row!
Row, will you!
Row, you thickheads, row!
It's witchcraft!
- Save yourselves!
- Ram them, I said. Ram them!
Mercy! Save me!
Minaton... Minaton.
Wait... wait!
And now for Casgar.
North by north-east.
I see nothing.
Breaker ahead!
The rocks and the reefs will be invisible.
It'll be impossible to land.
- I have an excellent idea.
- Yes?
Let's turn back.
- Lower the rowing boat.
- Aye aye, Captain.
Hassan, keep up!
Stay close together, move!
Rest.
How can you be sure where to find Melanthius?
This is a path.
There are tracks. Signs.
Forward, men!
There!
A great pillar.
- Must be a holy place.
- Built by a people of great skill.
- What can it be?
- A temple perhaps.
It seems to be carved out of solid rock.
Could be there is treasure in it.
Could be the castle of Melanthius!
Melanthius! Melanthius!
I will see if anyone is there.
- They'll kill us!
- Run for the wall!
They will not harm you now.
Have you been shipwrecked?
No, my ship is anchored safely.
I am Captain Sinbad.
Only those who were wrecked have landed here before.
But the Casgar people always found them first.
We seek the wise man known as Melanthius.
Does he truly exist?
- Does he live on this island?
- Why do you seek him?
It is a matter of great urgency and importance.
Go!
Go, I said!
This is Princess Farah from the distant city of Charak.
I am Dione.
- Come.
- But Melanthius... does he exist?
Follow me.
Truly incredible!
A magnificent city.
But completely deserted.
Who built it all?
- The ancestors of the natives.
- What happened to them?
They became too civilised and destroyed each other.
Is that where the savages live?
Those are the tombs of their forefathers.
- And those buildings to the right?
- Tombs of kings.
There is someone there.
Is that the great Melanthius?
Yes, father... I will.
Melanthius will see you.
- How did you?
- My father taught me.
He calls it "telepathia". A Greek word for communication of the mind.
Come, follow me.
- Master Melanthius.
- You're a brave man, Captain Sinbad.
And a remarkable navigator to have landed on Casgar safely.
Only for that have I agreed to see you.
Well, thank you... but I still don't understand how you know who I am.
The mind is an extraordinary thing.
Thought is transferable.
It can travel through space, even to the stars.
But the method needs time, patience and a skilful daughter.
What have you got in there?
Tell me.
- It's a cage holding...
- Wait! Don't tell me.
It's an arboreal anthropoid of the genus papio.
- No, it's a baboon!
- That's what I said, a baboon.
- What a dear little fellow.
- Careful!
He can be savage with everyone but the princess.
As a species they are aggressive and of low intelligence.
- He trusts only me.
- He looks so unhappy, poor creature.
Careful!
- It is the baboon about whom...
...you wish to see me. Yes, I know.
I suggest we continue below in my laboratory, out of the sun.
You claim it can write and play chess?
It, my brother, was a brilliant chess player from the age of seven.
Dione, fetch me a mirror.
As a scientist and alchemist
I know that metals can be transformed, -
- but as a philosopher...
Easy, fellow, easy.
I can also believe in the possibility of
...metaphysical change.
Thank you, Dione.
Let him see his face.
Go on!
He's weeping.
By all the gods!
A true baboon would have attacked its reflection, thinking it an enemy.
It would not have recognised itself and been moved to grief.
I am very happy to meet you,
Prince Kassim.
The oars...
Rafi, what has happened?
The oars are smashed.
It will take hours to repair. Quickly!
Sinbad found a way through.
Whatever drug or elixir it was that this woman...
Zenobia.
Whatever it was she used is the most powerful black magic -
- and is beyond my knowledge.
You see, unfortunately, time is on her side.
Perhaps the prince would like some of these.
Real apes are mostly vegetarian.
- How does he like his fruit?
- He does. He likes them.
I thought he would.
- Dione, where is the mint tea?
- Coming, father.
I brought him something.
Bananas... he likes those.
I'll serve the tea.
What did you mean when you said that time was on the side of Queen Zenobia?
The longer that transformation is delayed, the more likely -
- Kassim is to lose those human qualities that remain to him.
Then there is no hope for my brother?
Now, wait...
There was a time when men knew how to combat this form of black witchcraft.
A nation with an intelligence far superior to anything we know today.
They knew the secret of transforming matter.
Dione, help me find the Arimaspi scrolls.
The Arimaspi?
Yes, Archimedes of Syracuse, a very dear friend of mine.
He based many of his inventions on principles originally developed -
- by Arimaspi mathematicians.
Here they are!
Invaluable manuscripts... Where are they?
I've found them.
Yes, these are the ones.
Clear the table.
These scrolls are more than two thousand years old.
- There we are.
- What do they say?
This first one... will be of special interest to you, Captain.
It's sailing directions.
The first written authority.
The only way to restore Kassim is to undertake a journey to their country?
A journey to Hyperborea, the land of the Arimaspi, -
- is the only possible way of restoring Prince Kassim.
These scrolls confirm the legend.
It tells of a warm and green valley at the northernmost point of the world -
- surrounded by wide seas of ice.
There in the valley of Hyperborea, the Arimaspi built a shrine.
The shrine of the four elements:
Earth, fire, air and water.
Within that shrine is the source of all their extraordinary power.
This power enabled them to preserve their valley against the glacier -
- and to change or transform the nature of matter.
I have been experimenting with a similar power.
- Is there truly such a valley?
- Beyond a doubt.
Then how soon can you be ready to sail?
The journey would be impossible!
It's the coldest region in the world!
Cold, certainly. Difficult and dangerous, perhaps, but not impossible.
We have you to interpret the scrolls.
I'm too old!
Besides there's so little time.
Come with us, Melanthius.
It can't be this noble prince shall spend the rest of his days in a cage.
The shrine is his one chance. You're the only one that can lead us there!
Please, say you will.
- Where did you find that?
- With the scrolls.
The key! The only means of opening the door to the shrine.
Hyperborea... to visit the shrine, examine the very source of life.
Archimedes would split himself with envy.
Now, everyone, stand well back!
Imagine that power a million times greater used not for evil, but for good.
That is what the Arimaspi have left us!
Yes, I will go with you.
- Thank you!
- Yes, by all the gods, I will.
No way of reading the sun.
Cloud and fog.
Hurry, hurry!
Listen!
They are leaving!
Hurry! We must follow them.
With a following wind to drive us, we should be many leagues into the...
And into the Western Ocean before the next full moon.
- Why not sooner?
- Not possible.
Time is our enemy on all counts!
At the moment Kassim is still in possession of certain human qualities.
The longer the transformation is delayed, -
- the more he'll revert to a baboon's natural behaviour.
More aggressive, savage, dangerous.
He may never be Kassim again.
We are under full sail.
I can do no more.
It is believed that there is a swift ocean current due north -
- across the Casgars.
North! They're moving north towards the Celtic Isles, but why?
We should be close to Sinbad's ship.
Keep a lookout.
I must know what advice the Greek gave them.
I must know what they mean to do.
I can't!
It was powerful enough to transform Kassim.
I must know.
Now... by Hecate -
- and all the secrets of darkness and forces of hell.
Come!
Captain Sinbad!
Is there no way of increasing our speed?
A ship can only sail as fast as the wind allows.
I'll have to consult the chart again...
Now the moon is on the wane.
No, no, no...
If you study my design, -
- you'll see there's more curve in the runners. The snow will be deep.
But I have never seen snow, Master.
Here, let me try it.
I shall join you in a few minutes.
Maroof, the chart!
Here, sharpen this.
Bahadin, more ropeties for the sledges.
The cargo nets will need to be prepared.
Everything as strong, but as light as possible.
Hassan, I told you to get that knife sharpened!
No, you must try.
You can do better, you know you can.
No, Kassim, not like that.
The other way around.
Like that.
Very well, as you're so bad-tempered, no more writing today.
Baboon!
Kassim, be quiet.
Your friend is very disobedient today.
- Please, Kassim, I'm trying to work!
- Will you be still!
Father, why is he behaving like that?
Be careful.
In the cage, in it!
Well, well, well. And what by Zeus and all the gods have we got here?
- And who?
- Zenobia.
I thought as much.
- But how?
- Never mind how.
Be careful.
Remember she's a witch, and dangerous.
Put me down! Let me go!
Don't hold me!
Don't hold me!
How dare you!
Captain... the glass jar there on the shelf.
It's like trying to hold on to a scorpion. Dione, clear the table.
Captain, put the jar down over there.
Make a space.
- No wonder Kassim was so violent.
- You should have left her to him.
No, Princess, no.
I want to interrogate her.
I suggest that whatever power she has used -
- to transport herself here and change her size -
- is similar in power and property to that which transformed Kassim.
But what is it and where is it?
Leave her in my charge.
I will try to extract it from her.
You must take every care.
A confrontation with evil could be dangerous.
Captain, take the princess and Dione up on deck.
Come with me.
Now then, mistress...
What powers have you used to shrink yourself?
- I will never tell you.
- Oh dear.
I despise brutality, -
- but at this present moment
I'm prepared to reject compassion.
The sting of this insect can be fatal to the strongest, -
- but to someone of your size...
Then answer my questions and quickly!
What are you searching for here on this ship?
These perhaps?
Or this?
How could you know of their existence?
When will you decide to return to your proper shape and size? And how?
Something of unique power.
The power that might be used to return
Prince Kassim to his human form -
- and make our journey to the Arimaspi unnecessary.
The Arimaspi!
Where is it? And in what form?
A liquid? A powder?
My locket! ...Gone!
You've dropped it, haven't you?
Now, where would it be?
Kassim... have you seen it?
Here it is.
It's mine, it's mine.
It belongs to me!
It's smashed, the liquid's evaporating.
There's not much left.
- Take care, the liquid is precious.
- Evidently.
I believe it is the very stuff you used to transform Kassim into an animal.
Perhaps there's not enough left to retransform him. I must test it.
- Yes, on our friend here.
- No, that's mine! I need it!
Will he be tempted?
There's a good fellow.
Lap it up, that's the way.
No, no, there's not enough!
Be silent!
By all the gods!
Kill! Kill the Greek!
Get away from me!
Transformed... the locket!
Get back!
- It's a mad bee!
- What is it?
It's not a bee. It's a mosquito!
What a mosquito!
The bird is getting away!
Kill the bird first.
We need the locket.
Praise be to Allah that you're unhurt.
Alas,
I underestimated the power of Zenobia.
I fear I've thrown away a chance for Kassim. I am profoundly sorry.
You were right, Princess.
We should have left her to Kassim.
Try to calm him, Dione.
He's becoming more savage. Best to keep him locked in his cage from now on.
Safe... You are safe.
Is there enough?
Yes, by all the gods of the underworld, there must be!
Not enough! Not enough!
If only I had seen more.
Memorised more, recorded it into my brain.
- A valley.
- At the end of the world.
And here: The shrine of the legends.
The healing shrine.
We must let Sinbad show us the way.
And then I shall find the means to prevent Melanthius from interfering.
Come, help me.
Ahoy!
Ice! Ice ahead!
- Where away?
- Dead ahead. Icebergs!
At last!
- Will it be soon now?
- We must sail north for four more days.
The less distance to cover on foot the better. Anything to gain time.
The fourth full moon.
Two degrees port!
Look at them.
One column of that on top of us and we'd sink like a ship of lead.
The entrance to the tunnel is somewhere there.
If we could enter safely, our journey will be all but over.
Sinbad, there!
Exactly as described in the scrolls.
Hassan, fetch me the chart.
- The tunnel leads directly to the shrine.
- It'll crack the boat like a walnut!
We must take the longer route.
There's less than three moons left.
If only we could've entered the tunnel.
We'll never make headway against this.
It's getting thicker every hour.
The hull must split if we go further.
Maroof... load up the sledge.
Throw up the ropes...
Quickly!
Keep moving, don't stop!
Pull! Keep pulling.
- It's easier to abandon it!
- Keep moving.
The ice is no match for a boat of bronze.
- And Sinbad?
- Perhaps smashed, drowned or frozen.
Bahadin!...
What could it be?
What is it?
Look, it's beginning to crack!
I'll get the others!
On your feet! Seize anything you can!
Spears, axes, anything!
Melanthius, protect Dione and the princess!
A giant walrus! We must stop it before it reaches the camp!
Hit the eye! The eye!
Attack!
Get the cargo net.
Careful, Maroof!
Protect the supplies!
Get the cargo net!
Unravel it. This way. Quickly!
Open it. Spread it out.
Push, go on, push!
He's pulling us!
Pull away from him.
He's pulling us!
Help me.
Cut me loose.
Sinbad, my foot!
Cut me loose.
Hassan, your knife!
Cut me loose, cut me loose!
Too bad you couldn't hold him.
I should've liked to examine him.
- Walrus giganticus, prehistoric!
- I'm sorry. Next time I'll try harder.
Are you hurt?
It is said a man has only one life.
Now I have two.
I owe them both to Captain Sinbad.
I've never seen a black man turn white before.
No sign of a tunnel between the cliffs.
The chart in the scroll is precise.
There is an entrance -
- and I mean to find it.
Minaton, sail on!
We've found it! We've found it!
Look, it's the aurora, see?
Hyperborea just beyond the hills.
And that strange glittering light?
The Arimaspi call it the gift of the winter Apollo.
We call it aurora borealis.
And there, directly below the aurora, -
- the Valley of the Shrine.
He's turning carnivorous.
I hope it is not too late for Kassim.
He no longer responds to human speech or contact.
Except for Dione.
Take them, Maroof.
Protect the women.
Sinbad, stand still!
All of you, don't make any sudden moves.
He's as frightened of us as we are of him.
- I'm more frightened.
- I'm twice more frightened.
Sinbad... lower your sword and step back slowly.
Do it!
What sort of evil monster is it?
It's not a monster.
It's one of man's ancestors.
They're not evil.
They're called troglodytes.
I've got the skull of one of them in my laboratory.
He's coming closer!
Dione... speak to him.
Gently...
They have no idea of language, -
- but these primates were known for their gentleness with females.
There, there...
No harm.
We mean no harm.
Friends.
We are friends.
Dione, be careful!
Kassim, he means no harm.
Perhaps he might be able to help us.
Dione, Princess...
Persuade Kassim to bring the trog over here. I've something to show him.
Bring trog.
Bring him over there.
There... to my father.
Kassim, I want the troglodyte to look at this.
The face drawn on the scrolls!
It marks the entrance to the valley, the gate to the shrine.
Where, where?
Hyperborea!
By all the gods, he's done it!
Hassan, Maroof, the weapons.
There! There it is!
The entrance to the tunnel of ice!
The way to Hyperborea.
We shall be there first!
The tunnel, Minaton.
I will light the torches.
- Farah, are you all right?
- Yes.
There! Look over there!
- The last of the Arimaspi?
- Who can say?
Minaton.
Listen!
The boat is still moving!
There's some extraordinary force pulling us like a mighty magnet, -
- drawing us to the shrine.
The face from the scrolls...
The gate to the shrine.
Come on.
Trog seems frightened of the gate.
- Frightened of what lies beyond, maybe.
- Why should he be afraid?
Like all primitives, he's afraid of the unknown.
Afraid of what he can't understand.
Help me move the bar.
It's no use. We cannot move it without blocks and ropes.
Trog will help us.
He must help.
The shrine of the four elements.
- See, it exists! A reality.
- Hope for Kassim... at last.
The arch!
The boat is stopping.
Wait.
Go on, up into the sunlight.
There it is.
Come!
At last you'll have a use for that precious key of yours, -
- if you can find a lock to fit it.
We'll find it.
The scrolls haven't been wrong yet.
We must look for an opening somewhere there among the rocks.
We must be close.
Hurry, Rafi!
Nothing... nothing.
I could not find an entrance.
We must make an entrance.
Rafi, Minaton, stay clear!
Spirits of the underworld, infuse this potion with your powers!
What was that?
- It's like an earthquake.
- There can only be one possible answer.
The witch.
Zenobia.
- He'll never break through.
- He must! He must!
He must!
Minaton, pull!
He's done it!
He's done his work.
The wall is breached!
- Look there!
- Zenobia's creation.
A bull's head, but a...
...giant's body!
Almighty God, defend us.
They shouldn't have forced an opening.
The power of the shrine is threatened!
The atmosphere inside is destroyed!
This key is useless!
Perhaps there's still time, but we must be swift!
Drawn down from the crown of Apollo itself.
The guardian of the shrine...
The ice is melting.
Look out!
- We must act at once!
- The cage... and the chains!
Just as described in the scrolls.
We must put Kassim in the cage and pass him through the column of light.
Sinbad, the chains!
See if they still operate.
- Thank all the gods.
- The gods have abandoned you!
Too late, Sinbad!
Kassim will never be caliph!
Now, Rafi, now!
Not the animal, kill Melanthius!
They are helpless without him.
Sinbad, bring Kassim.
May the gods of the Arimaspi grant us the time!
Bring him up, bring him up!
O great Apollo! All you gods and forces that work for good against evil, -
- help us now! O great mystery, come to our mortal aid!
Reveal your secret!
Lower the cage!
Your Highness.
Prince Kassim...
This way, Your Highness.
Master Melanthius, he made it all possible.
- How shall I ever thank you?
- It's an old debt repaid.
The power of the shrine is failing! We must go! There's not a moment to lose.
The temperature's changing violently.
Be swift or this'll become our tomb!
Zenobia!
She's gone!
Stand back! Get back!
- Come on, let's go!
- No, not yet.
Now, move! Move!
Take Dione and the princess back to the gate.
- We shall not leave you!
- Do as I say!
If I do not join you within an hour, then head for Charak -
- before the seventh moon is full.
Maroof is dead.
They're coming!
Where's Maroof?
Come on, we must not waste a moment.

Ah, si. The mighty Coliseum!
The glory of Rome!

HAWK: You bet it does, baby!
Do you people realize what a shopping center we could put up there?
Plenty of parking too.
MAN: Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the world's highest office building.
Hawk Plaza...
130 stories of manmade glory!
In just a few hours, Hawk Enterprises will break ground on this incredible project.
How did it happen, you ask? I give you now the man that made it all possible.
Thank you, friends. Thank you.
My heart is too full to speak.
Ah, you see.
You've brought a tear to this flinty, old eye.
So, all I can say is thank you.
Thank you for allowing me to share a moment of your precious time.
Get those deadheads out of here.
What, are they gonna stand around all day and drink my booze?
All right, ladies and gentlemen, down to my office...
-(BUZZING)
-...where a scroll awaits you.
Hello.
SECRETARY: Mr. Barnsdorf, sir.
Hello, Barnsdorf.
When are you going to be ready for us to start digging?
What are you talking about?
That building site's as clean as a...
What's that?
I thought we got rid of that crummy little firehouse months ago!
There's just one holdup. We couldn't get old lady Steinmetz to sign the papers.
Just one, beat-up old lady makes monkeys out of the most overpaid lawyers in the country!
Come on, boys. I expect a little action, and I better get it or else!
For some reason, she doesn't seem to trust us.
Of course she doesn't.
Have you looked at yourselves?
Your own mothers wouldn't trust ya!
What we need is somebody so nauseatingly innocent, and so stomach-turningly helpful and so incredibly dumb anybody would trust him.
-(BUZZING)
- HAWK: What is it?
SECRETARY:
Mr. Willoughby Whitfield to see you.
He says he's your nephew.
Whoever he is, throw him out!
Don't bother me again!
Say, wait a minute.
Is that that dumb-looking kid of my sister's from back east?
He was going to law school or something?
He just finished law school.
He says he's a full-fledged lawyer.
He's a full-fledged lawyer.
Send him in.
Mr. Hawk will see you now.
Oh.
Thank you.
Come in, boy. Come in!
Isn't he beautiful?
Uncle Alonzo, I hereby present you with the first law college
Humanitarian-of-the-Year Award.
Here.
Oh, well, well.
Humanitarian of the Year, eh?
That's right, Uncle.
Award committees give out humanitarian awards to a lot of strange ducks, but why me?
I was the award committee.
You put in the fix!
You figured to take care of your Uncle Alonzo.
You're a smart boy!
If there's one thing I admire, it's somebody who knows how to use juice properly.
Juice?
Yes, juice. How to use muscle, influence, how to bend things his own way.
Oh, no. My goodness, no.
It wasn't done dishonestly.
I thought it over, and I couldn't think of anyone any more deserving than you.
How come?
From the day I was born, my mother never tired of telling me what a great man her brother was, getting rid of dirty old buildings and building shiny new ones, sending us California fruit at Christmas.
You were her idol.
You clowns get out of here.
I'm trying to have a nice talk with my favorite nephew.
HAWK: When I look into your eyes and see the shining light of idealism aglow there, it makes me young again and ready for battle.
Battle?
Yes, battle!
It has never been easy for us idealists.
Now, I'm going to give you a chance to put that idealism into play on your very first job.
Oh.
Picture if you will, a tough, little old lady, living in a rundown, rat-infested firehouse, standing right in the way of our latest civic benefaction.
There may be city builders who might find it in their heart to be vindictive to this old lady.
They might say that she feeds on the misery of the poor in that forsaken neighborhood, that she rolls drunks, that she teaches small children to steal and make them bring most of the take to her.
Would I, Alonzo Hawk,
Humanitarian of the Year, stoop to such tactics?
On the contrary!
I would do everything in my power to help that tough, no-good, little old lady.
I would give her a large sum for that worthless property, and I would provide a special price to her alone a lifetime lease in Eternity Towers, that beautiful new haven for helpless old people such as herself.
It has a gymnasium, a sauna, an old Rudolph Valentino-
Sessue Hayakawa movie.
It has a beauty parlor, hobby center, and instead of cooking her heart out over a hot stove, there would be automatic machines in every hall to lavish her with everything from pizza to hot chili.
Now wouldn't it make just your whole being happy to be part of all that?
When can I start, Uncle?
Here's the address. Get moving.
- Here.
- Thanks, pal.
Ah, isn't it breathtaking?
DRIVER: It's a mess, all right.
That guy, Hawk, oughta be hung.
What?
WOMAN: I'm coming.
Mrs. Steinmetz? Good morning.
My name is Willoughby Whitfield.
I'd like to discuss business with you.
Come in, won't you?
I can't.
You see this car has rolled onto my foot.
Oh, dear!
I guess somebody forgot to set the brake or something.
Herbie, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Get off of Mr. Whitfield's foot.
Herbie's always trying to protect me.
Herbie?
I'm quite capable of taking care of myself.
I was about to make a nice cup of tea.
Come in. You must have one with me.
Oh, thank you.
Of course, I have to humor Herbie.
He used to be a famous racing car, but his driver went to Europe to drive foreign cars, so he's a little sensitive.
You can understand that.
Yes. Now, to get down to business, Mrs. Steinmetz.
People have been worrying about you living in this old firetrap.
I've been asked to come over and...
Firehouse, not firetrap.
Firehouse, yes. Be that as it may, the least we can do...
Stop that! That's downright rude!
Do you know what he was playing?
Do Not Trust Him, Gentle Maiden.
Nothing personal.
- No.
- He's a friend of Herbie's, of course.
Friend of Herbie's?
So is old 22.
You may as well meet all the family while you're here.
Number 22 used to be on the old Clay Street line.
Herbie found him in a vacant lot.
Someone had used him as a chicken house.
He's much happier here, of course.
I can understand that you may have some emotional attachment to this old building...
Indeed, I have.
I was married here to my late husband,
Captain Steinmetz, of the San Francisco Fire Department.
- Oh?
- One of the heroes of the great fire.
We understand your position.
That's why Mr. Hawk has authorized...
Don't tell me you're from Alonzo Hawk?
Yes.
Oh, you have such a nice face.
Thank you.
Not at all like those ruffians he usually sends.
If you would just look at the size of this check.
I don't know anything about money.
My nephew, Tennessee Steinmetz, usually takes care of me.
He used to live here.
He had to rush off to Tibet because his guru got sick.
If you would just look at this...
What's a guru?
His teacher! My nephew is a student of Oriental Philosophy.
That's how he learned that things have an inner life.
Like wind, rain, traffic lights, can openers, flowers...
And little cars.
That's how Herbie and Tennessee became such great friends.
Mrs. Steinmetz, this sum of money could take care of you for the rest of your life.
I didn't have to study Oriental
Philosophy the way Tennessee did.
I could talk to Herbie right off.
Oh?
I guess it's in the blood.
See ya tomorrow!
WILLOUGHBY: I don't like to press, but believe me,
Mr. Hawk has your interest at heart.
I have an agreement here.
If you would just glance...
Oh, Nicole!
I want you to meet a gentleman from Mr. Hawk's.
- How do you do?
- Agh!
Poor Mr. Whitfield!
Such a nice young man.
They're bothering us again?
You've hurt your hand.
On the contrary, it feels marvelous.
Are you all right, Mr. Whitfield?
What was that?
Nicole Harris, a very brave young lady.
She works for the airline.
Last week she knocked out a hijacker with a bottle of California wine.
Now, get out. If you or any more of Hawk's stooges come around, you'll get worse than that.
Please. Mr. Whitfield and I were having a nice conversation.
I'll bet. But...
Isn't it time for your nap?
Mr. Whitfield is just going.
Well, very well. Good-bye, Mr. Whitfield.
I hope I'll see you again when I come down.
Mrs. Steinmetz...
- Out! Out!
- What?
Please, have a heart. This is my first assignment. I can't afford to fail.
I said, out!
All right, all right.
Miss, you look like a sensible person.
You must know living all alone in this crummy neighborhood is no place for an elderly woman.
What do you mean "alone"?
She's got me...
And she's got Herbie.
That's another thing.
That goofy story about this car, that's a sure sign she's coming apart.
So you think it's goofy?
Of course, don't you?
How would you like to go for a little ride?
I thought you didn't like me?
I'd like to take you for a ride in Herbie.
I'd like that very much.
That's very nice of you.
I'll be ready in a minute.
All right, Herbie. Let's get going.
Miss Harris, you're obviously an intelligent young woman.
Why do you pretend to talk to this car?
People might wonder.
Don't listen to him, Herbie. Just move it.
I can understand Mrs. Steinmetz thinking of this car as a person.
Old age has many fantasies. It only proves that she needs Mr. Hawk's help.
Remember, Alonzo Hawk sent him.
You and I know better, don't we?
You stubborn bucket of bolts!
You always have to do everything your way.
Let's stop kidding ourselves.
This is just an ordinary little car, like a million other ordinary, rather unattractive... Whoa!
I don't think you should have said that.
Herbie's very sensitive about his appearance.
All right, you've had your laugh.
You ought to stop now.
You won't get Herbie to stop until you say you're sorry.
The thing that upsets me most about this thing is you trying to maintain the fiction about this... Whoa!
Please, tell Herbie you're sorry.
All right!
Herbie, I'm sorry.
What do you think now?
I think you're a skillful driver, but I don't know if I'd like to have you drive me again.
You think it's a trick?
Yes. I would say the whole thing is a trick.
Would you like to drive?
Yes.
Good.
There, you see, this car is just your ordinary, rather stupid-looking... Whoa!
What do I do now?
It's too late now. You're on your own.
I just hope Herbie hasn't lost his sense of humor.
WILLOUGHBY:
"Chicken tournament jousting today."
What? What's it up to now?
I don't know.
It's hard to figure Herbie out sometimes.
ANNOUNCER:
The gallant and chivalrous contenders
are now taking their places on the field of honor.
At the north end of the list,
the undefeated champion of the tournament,
earless, brutal, unforgiving,
the Red Knight!
Yeah!
At the south end, his stouthearted adversary,
the ever-popular Sir Lancelot!
I don't know what Herbie's up to, but I hope it's not what I think it is.
ANNOUNCER: Let the joust begin!
Give the signal, Your Majesty.
What are they doing?
Seems dangerous to me.
Hey, what are they doing?
I think this is where I get out.
Good idea. I'll join you.
ANNOUNCER: The victor, thus far, has demolished all who oppose him.
The surviving champion, your favorite and mine,
the Red Knight.
At the other end,
we have a mysterious new contender,
but the name doesn't matter.
No one lasts for long against the Red Knight.
- Let the joust begin!
-(REVVING)
No, Herbie! Wait!
I take everything back.
I apologize. I believe, Herbie!
I believe!
My brave champion, you have won me!
Take me to your kingdom.
You win the bread, man. $3.
Uh, I'm beginning to think that I owe you an apology.
Oh, no, I can't stand men who apologize.
Oh, uh, well, may I take you to lunch?
All right.
I used to live in a little apartment building opposite the firehouse.
I loved it. Then Alonzo Hawk came along to tear the place down.
And kicked me out.
I'm sure he didn't mean it personally.
Now you know why I go crazy every time
I hear the name Hawk. How's your jaw?
It's all right. It's... Ooh.
I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know it was your first assignment?
You couldn't possibly know what a no-good he is.
Miss, there's something
I should tell you...
Anyway, Mrs. Steinmetz took me in until I could find another place to live.
When I found out what Hawk was up to,
I stayed on to protect her.
I wasn't gonna let rats from Alonzo Hawk talk her out of her home.
I don't think you're being quite fair.
Fair? To Alonzo Hawk?
Yes.
Don't tell me he's conned you the way he's conned everybody else.
I think I should tell you that...
Did you know...
He put a parking garage on the lot where the DiMaggios learned to play baseball?
Please, I...
His factories are polluting all the fish in the Bay.
Look,you...
His skyscraper casts a cold, gray shadow on the children's playground all day long.
Let me tell you...
He kicked 30 old-time Chinese families off Grand Avenue to make room for his skyscraper.
Please, Miss Harris.
I can't believe Uncle Alonzo would do things like that.
Wait a minute! Uncle!
He's your uncle?
Yes...
You rotten spy!
Here's your warm milk, Grandma.
Be sure and drink it.
You know how good it is for you.
Yes, dear. I still can't understand why you hit him with a boiled lobster.
Grandma, I wish I could stop doing things like that.
I really sort of like him.
I'm glad to hear that.
After all, brilliant, eligible lawyers don't grow on trees.
What are you leading up to?
Um, nothing, dear.
I just thought that perhaps you could talk things over with that nice Mr. Whitfield.
Nice try, Grandma.
But if I want a young man,
I'll have to get him my way.
I suppose so, dear.
Stop hatching plots and go to sleep.
Yes, dear.
Good night, Grandma.
Good night, dear.
NICOLE: Good night, Herbie.
Pleasant dreams.
MRS. STEINMETZ:
He used to be a famous racing car.
He used to be a famous racing car.
He used to be a famous racing car.
Uncle Alonzo,
I dropped by to talk to you man-to-man, so I could look you squarely in the eye.
No, I'm wearing makeup because of a black eye.
A girl hit me in the face with a boiled lobster the moment I mentioned your name.
This same wonderful, intelligent, clearsighted girl was able to convince me what kind of a person you really are.
I do not hold with your scheme of cheating Mrs. Steinmetz out of her home so that you may build your concrete anthill on the spot where she has known so much happiness.
Hmm.
I think you are despicable, greedy, grasping and wholly without principle or pity.
I also believe you are not a nice person.
If you write my mother, who is also your sister, Frieda, please do not tell her that I wear makeup as a general rule.
I'm going back to Missouri now, so you may no longer use me as a cat's paw.
I bid you farewell, more in sorrow than in anger.
Please do not send us any more fruit for Christmas.
Good-bye, Grandma.
NICOLE: Hi, everybody!
Hi, Herb.
No hard feelings, okay?
I'm so glad you and Herbie decided to make up.
Oh.
I'm just going for my morning walk.
Come with me.
We could have a nice chat.
I just came to say good-bye.
I'm going home to Hawk City, Missouri.
Oh, what a pity!
Nicole was hoping to see you again.
She's a wonderful girl, even though you don't seem to agree with her.
I do agree with her now.
As a matter of fact,
I'm going straight to my uncle to tell him exactly what I think of him.
That's splendid!
He might be an important man but it's time somebody told him the real truth.
Nicole will be thrilled.
Please wait 'til she comes back.
To be honest, I'm more afraid of her than I am of my uncle.
Nonsense! Nicole is just a high-spirited young lady.
Oh, that's for sure.
Good-bye, Mrs. Steinmetz.
Don't weaken about the firehouse.
Don't you worry.
Call my nephew wherever he's staying and tell him to get right over here.
Yes, sir. And Mr. Barnsdorf is on the phone for you.
Yeah, what do you want?
You ready for us to dig yet?
My boys are gettin' itchy.
I'll tell you when to start digging.
Thought I'd remind you I got some high-priced digging equipment and crew sittin' around playin' gin rummy, waitin' for you to make up your mind.
It's costing you 80 grand a day.
Stop bugging me, Barnsdorf.
I'll give you the order to start digging any moment now.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawk. I called the motel but your nephew checked out.
What do you mean he's checked out?
When? Where?
Who told him he could check out?
How dare he disappear when he knows I'm worried sick.
I'll tear his chicken-Iivered gizzard to pieces.
I'll stomp him silly!
I'll take this letter knife and I'll stab that kid in his ungrateful breastbone.
You know me, Millicent.
Normally I'm a kindly fellow.
But when I get crossed, I go bananas.
Yes? Oh.
It's your nephew.
Willoughby?
Where are you?
Oh, hi, Uncle.
I thought I'd save time and phone you the news.
That's marvelous, great!
You're a smart boy!
That Hawk blood will tell in the end.
All ashore that's going ashore.
What's all that noise?
And what news?
The news I was leaving town.
Leaving town?
Uh, I'm on the ship-to-shore phone...
From the deck of the Swedish freighter, the Gustav Gustaffson, bound for Helsinki.
(GASPING) Helsinki!
I'm glad you're taking it like this, Uncle.
You know, you really should leave Mrs. Steinmetz alone.
Haaa!
Don't worry. You'll feel better in the morning.
Stop talking like an idiot.
I feel better right now.
Alonzo Hawk may be betrayed, but he is never defeated!
Outta my Way!
Since none of you pitiful excuses for men have enough muscle to move a feeble old lady off her property,
I'll go and do it myself, like I have to do everything around here that's important.
- Now, Mr. Hawk.
- Oh, shut up!
We'll start on number one, harassment.
And I wrote the book on harassment.
We'll shut off her phone, turn off her water.
We'll sic the health and building inspectors on her.
Steal her dog.
She doesn't have a dog.
What do you mean? A little old lady living in a place like that?
Who looks out for her?
How does she get around?
She has a little car she goes everywhere in.
You fellows go and pick it up!
Yes, Mr. Hawk.
A bunch of lamebrains. Hold it, hold it!
You fellows'll probably even foul up on a simple assignment like this.
The first team is on the job.
I'll go pick the car up myself.
Overeducated pinheads!
All right, gentlemen, start taking notes.
Learn how the grownups do it.
You gentlemen are probably unaware of it, but I began my fabulous career as a repossessor of motorcars.
At the tender age of 19,
I was the best-known repossessor of cars west of the Mississippi.
Hot-wire Hawk, they called me.
Observe, gentlemen.
Screwdriver, pliers and a piece of wire.
Check your watches, and you will see that I will return with the object of my mission in 15 minutes or less.
All right, let's go.
Madam is not at home, sir.
Thank you, Maxwell.
I won't be needing you anymore.
Very well, sir.
Once you learn something when you're young, you just never forget it.
Except a six-year-old kid could steal this one-cylinder hair dryer.
Quiet!
All right, buddy, let's get this thing outta here before I...
Oh, hello, Mr. Hawk.
What are you doing in this little car?
Just shut up and push!
Certainly, Mr. Hawk.
One tiny thing, is the car out of gear?
Of course it's out of gear, you nitwit! Just push!
All right, Mr. Hawk.
Okay, push.
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you gonna do about that cab?
Are we trying to get tough?
Don't you dare to threaten me.
All right, Mr. Hawk.
Well?
Three minutes to go.
Oh, hello, Commissioner.
Got a little problem.
We gotta tow him outta here.
Mr. Hawk, just sit quietly this time.
Don't touch the pedals or the gears, understood?
Don't order me around.
I will do as I please!
The traffic commissioner shall hear about this!
I am the commissioner.
Then what are you doing in that monkey suit?
The traffic commissioner would dress in dignified clothes.
This happens to be my dress uniform.
I was on my way to the ceremonies for "I am a Policeman" day.
Okay, let's go.
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Commissioner, call your office.
There's been an accident.
See the man. See the man.
One minute to go. He'll never make it.
Oh, if Mr. Hawk says he'll do something, he'll...
Here he is!
Get that car, dead or alive!
Right away, sir!
Mr. Hawk?
If you'll sign a few of these citations.
Compliments of the commissioner.
Well, he's got more stuff than I thought.
Yeah, I'm sorry he's going too.
All right, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Flight 38 for Las Vegas...
I tell you, Mother, you've never seen Uncle Alonzo in such a rage!
He's probably having this airport watched right now.
But he won't find me.
I'm wearing a disguise. A disguise...
A beard and a mustache.
Yes, I know, Mother. I promised I wouldn't grow a beard when I left.
Don't you understand? It isn't real.
No, I will not go back and apologize to Uncle Alonzo!
He is a greedy, unscrupulous, no-good, thieving, uh, uh, uh, coyote. Yes, thank you, miss. Oh!
No, Mother, my asthma is not coming back.
No, nothing's the matter with me.
Everything is just fine now.
This is the turning point of my life.
Uncle Alonzo used to push me around and you were always telling me what to do.
Then I met this perfectly wonderful girl.
I was even afraid of her 'til now.
I've just decided something.
I am not going to be a rabbit anymore!
Good-bye, Mother.
- Ooh.
- Ooh!
Come along, Herbie. Off to market.
Thank you, Herbie.
Let me see now.
Half a dozen tomatoes.
Um, the broccoli looked very nice yesterday.
What else was there?
We've sighted the car, Mr. Hawk.
We're moving in for the kill now.
They're moving in for the kill now.
Ooh!
What happened?
You said you were moving in for the kill!
Negative.
A little premature, I'm afraid, sir.
She's obviously a very desperate woman.
But don't worry.
She won't make it this time.
Another of your shortcuts, Herbie?
Where is she now?
She's still going up and up.
It's incredible!
She's driving like a madman.
Oh, Herbie, behave yourself.
You knocked my glasses off.
Where on Earth is she?
Don't answer it. It'll be Hawk.
Look!
No, Mr. Hawk, the phone didn't ring before.
Were you trying to reach us?
Did you grab the car?
Any moment now.
There it goes, into the Sheraton-Palace Hotel.
The Sheraton-Palace Hotel?
May I draw your attention to the superb baby shrimp?
All right, Herbie, but you'll never convince me this is a shortcut to Vern's Market.
Gentlemen, do you have a reservation?
There it is!
MAN: After her. Somebody stop her.
Don't let her get away.
Come on, let's go!
There's only one thing gives me the creeps, that's that weird little car...
What's the matter with you?
There it is!
Pull yourself together.
You're getting hysterical.
Take two aspirins and lie down.
One of us has to keep our nerve.
Come on, come on! Move it!
(CHUCKLING) Now we've got him.
Stop woolgathering, Herbie.
We really must get to the market.
Oh, oh! Wait a minute.
Look out! He's coming back!
Ooh!
Look out! Look out!
Grandma, I was worried about you.
Is everything all right?
Wonderful! Herbie took me for a nice drive on the bridge.
Let me help you.
It's Mr. Whitfield.
So nice to see you again.
This morning you were on your way to Missouri.
Nicole spoke to me.
Grandma, Mr. Whitfield's agreed to help us fight his uncle.
Wonderful! Stay for dinner.
I've already invited him.
Why don't you take those out to the kitchen?
Yeah. Thank you.
What a fine young man!
You look so right together.
Oh!
Now, if there's anything I can do...
There is one thing, Grandma.
Just let nature take its course.
Oh, yes, dear.
Oh, I wouldn't want to interfere, not for anything.
Oh.
By the way, we're going to want more broccoli for dinner.
Will you and Willoughby pick me up some, please?
Sure.
Incidentally, you ought to drive down to the beach.
Grandma!
It's the most beautiful day.
We'll just go get some broccoli.
Yes, dear, of course.
I'm not gonna say another word, Herbie.
There's nothing I can do.
Of course, I can't help it if you happen to have a mind of your own.
Can I?
I guess I should have told Mrs. Steinmetz I don't like broccoli.
Herbie, where are you going?
The young lady and gentleman have turned towards the north.
It would appear that they're not immediately returning to the firehouse.
See that they don't.
Do anything you have to, but don't let them return to that firehouse until after dark.
Do you read me?
Perfectly, sir.
Oh, Grandma put him up to this.
Where's he taking us?
I don't know, but I could make a guess.
Pardon me, sir.
Is this the only road from the beach?
Yep!
Would you care, sir, to earn $50?
Don't mind.
We wish you to obstruct the road from the beach for two hours.
My employer is preparing a surprise party...
Don't explain.
Just give me the money.
It's very romantic here, don't you think?
Do you know that's the first time I've ever heard anyone use the word "romantic" in a real conversation?
I hope I wasn't being too forward, but it is romantic.
I think that's what Grandma had in mind.
She always thought the Pacific Ocean was very romantic.
Captain Steinmetz proposed to her on the beach near the Cliff House 50 years ago.
I'm sorry I punched you the first time I met you.
That's okay.
It wasn't very ladylike to hit you with a boiled lobster.
It's okay.
You can hit me back if you want.
That isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Oh!
Herbie! Oh!
Oh, it's time we were getting back.
Herbie, come on!
Leave that sea gull alone!
Herbie!
I wish that car would learn to mind.
Herbie, please!
Herbie!
Heel, Herbie!
See? Just needs a firm hand.
You know, Willoughby, sometimes you really surprise me.
Hey, what's happening?
Sorry, sir. My rear axle's frozen.
But, how're we...
Sorry.
WILLOUGHBY: No, Herbie!
Ooh!
Whoa!
Oh.
Ahh.
Oh!
Ahh!
Oh, well, here we are.
Ah.
Nicole?
Very quietly and quickly, pull your hand back inside the car.
Why?
We've got company.
Hmm? (GASPS)
NICOLE: That's ridiculous! Why would a shark follow a Volkswagen?
WILLOUGHBY:
Because he thinks the same thing I do.
We're going to sink.
WILLOUGHBY: Uh, excuse me.
Can you tell me the way to San Francisco?
Yeah, man. Straight up the beach road, first left, second right.
Thank you.
Whoa...
Old number 22, it's gone!
What?
They came with a big truck.
Everything's gone.
Who did it?
It said on the truck,
"Alonzo Hawk Van & Storage."
Haven't you ever jimmied a lock before?
Of course not.
It isn't a hobby of mine.
Hurry. We can't just stand here.
(ENGINE REVVING,
TIRES SCREECHING)
Good for Herbie!
HAWK ON RECORDING: Halt!
You have been detected by electronic surveillance.
You are about to be surrounded
by agents of the Alonzo Hawk Security Service.
Touch nothing in this warehouse
or you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Don't you dare talk to me like that, Mr. Hawk!
I want my things back and I'm going to have them!
I think that's a recording.
I don't care what it is.
Halt! You have been...
Let's find your things before somebody gets here.
...by agents of the Alonzo Hawk Security Service.
Touch nothing in this warehouse
or you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Your things aren't here.
Maybe we better...
GUARD: All right, hold it!
Okay, get your hands up.
MRS. STEINMETZ: Don't you get fresh with me, young man.
Watch it, Smitty. She's the ring leader.
SMITTY: Come on, grandma. Move it!
Keep your hands up.
MRS. STEINMETZ:
I most certainly will not.
If you say please, I might consider it.
All right, please.
There now, you see, that wasn't so difficult after all.
If you'd mind your manners, life would be easier for all of us.
Now, would you be good enough to tell me exactly what you are doing with my furniture?
GUARD: How do we know, lady?
All I can tell you is that nothing goes out without Mr. Hawk's okay.
Look out, Smitty! Run!
There goes some more.
Out of the way!
Hey, we're out off!
How're we gonna get out of here?
You know, Smitty, I don't think
Mr. Hawk's gonna be happy about this.
(GRUNTING) Whew!
Oh, evenin', mother.
Eh, ain't you a might old to be a stewardess?
There've been a lot of changes since I come to visit this town.
Barnsdorf, will you stop worrying about your digging equipment?
You're paying me 80 grand a day.
Will you stop bothering me?
I have broken the old lady's spirit. Yeah!
I've taken every stick of furniture.
She's sitting in an empty firehouse, ready to listen to reason.
Barnsdorf, I guarantee you you can start digging first thing Monday morning.
Yeah.
What?
That's right, sir.
Yes, they got away with everything.
Call out every unit of the mobile security force!
We'll nail 'em to the wall!
Stop at the top so we can figure out how to get down the other side.
Right.
Uh, like I was sayin', little lady,
I was doin' fine 'til I got into that sheep-dip you call liquor in this town.
My name is Judson.
Got a little cow ranch a couple hundred miles north of here.
Been alone with those cows for over 40 years, so I thought
I'd get into town and stir up a little excitement.
Might be my last opportunity.
I better get a piece of rope and tie us all up together, nice and snug.
Oh, no! It looks like Uncle Alonzo!
No, Herbie! Don't do it!
Oooh!
After him!
Faster! Faster!
Oh, Herbie, now you have got us in a mess!
Now, Herbie, stop this minute!
VENDOR: Hey, watch out.
What are you tryin' to do!
You busted my machine!
Look, here comes another one.
That's not nice. Look what you've done to my "pretzellette"!
Mrs. Steinmetz!
Mrs. Steinmetz, put on the brake!
You're a fine lookin' woman.
Did you say you was married?
No, the Captain's been gone these many years.
There he is, Captain Steinmetz, hook and ladder, number 27, city of San Francisco, a fine gentleman.
Nice picture.
You carry it around with you everywhere?
Mrs. Steinmetz, use the hand brake!
- Oh! You okay?
-(GROANING) Yeah.
I declare, little lady, you're a sight to make this country boy's heart flutter.
Oh, don't be silly. I'm much too old.
Oh-oh-ho. The way I figure it, you're just about comin' into your prime.
Can't that thing play somethin' with a little more pep?
How nice to see people dressing up for parties again.
Was that anyone we know?
Looks like these cars go a lot faster than when I was a young fella.
Well, you can't stop progress!
- Look at that!
-(GASP)
Herbie, you gotta help us!
Steady, Herbie!
Come on! Come on! Move closer!
Hurry up! We're running out of street.
Closer! A little more!
Go On, Jump!
Whoa. (GROANING)
(GRUNTING) Oh!
Hmm, well, here's where I get off.
Thanks for the ride, little lady.
Appreciate it.
Sure like to cross trails with ya again sometime.
Are you all right, Grandma?
Of course.
I just met the most interesting man.
Good morning, Grandma.
Sleep well after being up so late?
Not a wink, my dear. I suddenly realized what an enormous amount of trouble Alonzo Hawk is giving me.
I'm going straight down to his office to give him a piece of my mind.
- Oh, no, you don't.
-(HONKING)
Oh, I have to go. Bye-bye, Grandma.
Please, don't do anything foolish.
Willoughby, I know Grandma and I think she's up to something.
Don't worry, I'll keep her out of mischief.
You better or else I'll get tough again.
Bye.
Bye.
Uh, where are you going,
Mrs. Steinmetz?
To see Mr. Hawk.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
You heard what Nicole said.
Nicole is a very sweet girl. But at her age she shouldn't start ordering me around.
Do you mind if I go with you?
That won't be necessary.
- No, but I think Nicole would prefer it.
-(ENGINE STARTING)
Hey, come back!
Mrs. Steinmetz! Come back!
This certainly is a nasty whiplash,
Mr. Hawk.
I'm afraid you're trying to do too much.
I know, Millicent.
But except for you, who can I depend on?
I have to do every...
Who are those clowns?
Your new lawyers.
You fired the others yesterday.
Oh, now look, fellas, I'm gonna tear down the Steinmetz firehouse.
Just a moment.
You have the necessary permit?
Of course I don't have a permit!
I don't even own the land yet!
Sorry, Mr. Hawk, such an action would jeopardize the legal status of your new building.
We can't permit you...
Will you get outta here?
I didn't hire you to tell me what I can't do!
I hired ya to tell me how I can do it!
Go!
You see, everybody lets me down.
You know me, Millicent.
I'm enthusiastic, boyishly eager.
All I get is cheap lawyer talk.
Poor Mr. Hawk. It isn't fair.
Nevertheless, I shall not falter.
I am like a sensitive, finely-tuned violin.
All I need to restore me is a few moments of peace and quiet.
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, you out there!
Hey!
Hey, turn it off!
You idiot!
What do you think you're doing?
Washin' the windows, every Wednesday, Mr. Hawk's orders.
I am Mr. Hawk. Get out of here!
Okay, cancel the windows.
And you better shut the window!
Runs up the air conditioning bill.
You're fired, get your money...
Mr. Hawk's orders!
They may harass me, but don't let them ever think they have me beaten.
That is when Alonzo Hawk is at his most dangerous.
Yes, sir.
(CHUCKLING) Millicent.
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to try and get
Fred Loostgarten on the phone for me.
He used to work with our wrecking company before I fired him.
I understand he has a little one-horse operation of his own now.
Yes, I think that's how Captain
Steinmetz would handle the situation.
Excuse me, could you tell me where Mr. Hawk's office is?
Yes, ma'am, the old buzzard hangs out
28 stories up, six windows to the left.
You can't miss it.
I'm sorry. I don't hear so good from this side.
28th floor! You can't miss it!
Thank you so much.
No! Mrs. Steinmetz! Stop!
Mrs. Steinmetz! Come back! Stop!
Mrs. Steinmetz!
(STAMMERS) Help!
Grandma! Mrs. Steinmetz!
(GRUNTING) Help!
Help!
Missus... Grandma!
Help! Mrs. Steinmetz!
Grandma! Help!
Mrs. Steinmetz! Help!
Grandma!
Is that you, Mr. Whitfield?
Where are you?
Down here!
Help me!
Oh, there you are.
Just a minute. I'm coming.
No, no, stay where you are.
Just take us down.
Of course, Mr. Whitfield.
But first you must promise to let me see Mr. Hawk.
Anything! I'll do anything you say!
Very well, Mr. Whitfield.
Hey, Loostgarten, old buddy, how are ya?
I know things haven't been going too well for ya, but that's the way life is.
Yeah, right, Mr. Hawk.
I got to thinking...
I've got to find a job for my old friend, and here it is.
You know that crummy old firehouse on the site where
I'm building Hawk's Plaza?
Yeah?
I want you to get your wrecking ball and smash it.
I want nothing left but itsy-bitsy splinters.
Don't worry, Willoughby.
I shall be perfectly polite... But firm.
What do you mean,
"send you over a permit"?
I don't get one 'til tomorrow morning.
Yeah, but, Mr. Hawk, I...
Loostgarten!
The job has gotta be done tonight!
Take it or leave it! (HANGS UP)
Millicent, my dear, will you put a check in the mail to Loostgarten?
That's Loostgarten Wrecking Company, uh, a thousand on account.
Tonight he's gonna smash that crummy firehouse to matchwood.
That'll teach that old battle ax a lesson.
No, no, Grandma, he won't like that.
MRS. STEINMETZ:
I don't care what he doesn't like!
Knock down my home, will he?
Oh, no! Uncle Alonzo, I don't believe you've met Mrs. Steinmetz.
How do you do?
Don't worry, Uncle.
Everything's under control!
Yeah, just dandy!
Now you've done it, Mr. Hawk!
You've made Herbie very angry!
HAWK: No! No! Get out!
Get out! Get out!
No! No! No! Go away!
No! Herbie! Stop!
Ooh! Wrong way!
Stay away from me!
Somebody come in here and stop this thing!
Don't you think we ought to see what all those noises are?
When Mr. Hawk says he doesn't want to be disturbed, that's it.
Herbie.
Uncle?
Now's a good time to explain. Uh...
You! (SPUTTERING)
Help!
Herbie, stop it!
Will you be going out for a while, Mr. Hawk?
Herbie!
Gotta get away from that thing.
- Good morning, Miss Millicent.
- Good morning.
Mrs. Steinmetz?
I told you Mr. Hawk was busy.
Aw, shut up! And get off my building!
There must be some way to make this car behave.
I don't like to threaten Herbie.
He has been trying to help us.
But there's one thing Herbie is afraid of.
Whoa!
Now stop, Herbie.
Don't make me do it.
Please, do it, Grandma.
Very well, Herbie.
It so happens that I know this nice used car lot.
I'd certainly hate to call Mr. Honest Al, the used car man.
(QUIETLY) Of course, you know I never would do it.
And between you and me, I don't think
Herbie believes I would either.
But it always works.
(SIGHING) What a lovely morning.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Did we get the name of the gentleman who thinks he's going to knock down my firehouse?
Hmm. It was Loostgarten, of the Loostgarten Wrecking Company.
I'm going to write that down.
We're going to need it.
Well, thanks anyway for trying Millie. Bye.
Millie's one of the stews who works for Hawk's airline.
She can't find his address either.
May I say something?
No, I'm still mad at you for not taking care of Grandma.
If we can't find out where he lives, my idea won't work.
NICOLE: We'll just have to think of something else.
WILLOUGHBY:
I am going to say something.
I've sent Uncle Alonzo a card every Christmas since I was seven years old, and here's his address.
Willoughby, oh! You're wonderful!
Right.
Loostgarten speaking.
This is Alonzo Hawk.
Right, Mr. Hawk.
Loostgarten, there's been a slight change of plan.
I don't want you to knock down that firehouse tonight.
Instead I want you to knock down
343 Oleander Heights.
You got that?
343 Oleander Heights!
Right.
Write it down!
I don't want to see you blackballed in the wrecking ball business,
If you get what I mean! (CHUCKLING)
You were wonderful!
Oh!
Yes... I know it's 3:00 in the morning, but I can't sleep.
Well, you're my doctor, aren't ya?
Sometimes the old-fashioned remedies seem to work best, Mr. Hawk.
Have you ever tried counting sheep?
Sheep!
Picture in your mind's eye a grassy green meadow, a whitewashed, three-rail fence, a flock of sweet little sheep.
They begin to jump over the fence. One sheep...
Six sheep, seven sheep, eight sheep, nine sheep, ten... (SNORING)
Yeah, what is it?
Sorry to disturb ya at this time of night, Mr. Hawk.
But a guy in my job can't afford to make mistakes.
What are you talking about?
That address you gave me on the phone.
What about it?
343 Oleander Heights.
Are you sure that's the right address?
Of course I'm sure, you idiot.
I know it as well as I know my own address.
Wait a minute.
It is my own address!
Loostgarten!
No! Not this! This is my house!
You dumb jerk!
Loostgarten!
This time you're really through. Help!
You...
MRS. STEINMETZ: We beat him!
I knew he'd cave in.
He just couldn't stand the heat.
Hello? Oh, good morning, Mr. Hawk.
Well, now that it's all over,
I just had to phone you and tell you how much I admire the plucky fight you put up for that sweet little firehouse.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Hawk.
Well, what brought about my change of heart was an accident to my own little house.
It only brought home to me how terrible it is to lose something you really love.
What happened, Mr. Hawk?
Well, a very confused man came along
and knocked down the whole side of it,
smashed it to rubble. (CHUCKLING)
Someone knocked down
Mr. Hawk's house.
Aw, what a rotten shame.
HAWK'. But it...
It did serve a purpose.
It made me realize I can't knock down any more of San Francisco's beautiful old buildings.
So I don't want you to worry that sweet, little, gray head of yours about it.
Is that clear?
Yes, Mr. Hawk. Thank you, Mr. Hawk.
All right, Mrs. Steinmetz, and I'll drop by one of these days and have a cup of tea with you.
Bye.
I always said you'd do the finer thing, Mr. Hawk.
What are you talking about, fathead?
Giving up Hawk Plaza.
Are you fooled by this phony story?
But, Mr. Hawk, you can't go back on this.
Oh yes, I can!
I can say I was misquoted!
I can say they printed the story purposefully to discredit me in the eyes of the public.
Well, it's an old gag!
It's out of my bag of tricks.
You mean we're still going after the old lady?
Right for the jugular vein, baby, right for the old jugular.
I wish Grandma would hurry up and get here.
Can't start a celebration party without her.
It gives us a chance to have a quiet talk.
We never had one before.
Something always happened.
Uh, oh, thank you.
Nicole, there's something
I've been wanting to say.
What's that, Willoughby?
Did I ever tell you that my great-grandfather Whitfield was one of the first men to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel?
Oh, well, was he all right afterward?
I don't know. They never found him.
I think I'll Call Grandma.
The giant lobster is very good tonight, sir.
Of course, no lobster.
I did mean to call, dear. But I was just sitting here thinking to myself what a fine time those two young people must be having without me in the way.
Now listen, Grandma,
I love you very much, but I've had enough of your matchmaking.
Now you get over here like you promised.
If I do marry Willoughby, I'd like the satisfaction of nailing him myself.
Do go ahead without me, dear. I think I'll just have a quiet evening at home.
(YAWNING) Good-bye, dear.
Now, do go on with your wonderful story about the cows, Mr. Judson.
I swear I never seen a handsome woman like yourself who had so much an interest in cows.
That's quite natural, Mr. Judson.
After all, a cow is not only useful, but an extremely decorative animal.
Ain't it just!
As I was saying, I got this nice little 200-acre spread up in Oregon.
What in tarnation you doin' that for?
I'm not quite sure.
I think I saw this once in a movie.
Oh, no!
Just let me get my hands on the brute responsible for this.
Now. Horse whipping's too good for him.
What on Earth?
It's Mr. Hawk!
Herbie! Don't you dare!
Oh! Every man for himself!
Herbie must have gone for help.
Hope he makes it through to the fort.
We must be cut off.
Okay, Steinmetz!
We know you're in there.
We've got you surrounded.
We'll give you 10 minutes to get your stuff together and get out
before I grind this dump to powder!
Now you hold on there, Mister!
This little lady's under my personal protection and she stays here!
Ten minutes, Steinmetz!
Uh, to get back to my great-grandfather at Niagara Falls,
I don't think I put it quite right.
What I wanted to say was, though we Whitfield men look like rabbits, we have always liked challenge, the scent of danger in our nostrils, the high road to adventure.
Yes, Willoughby?
That's why I want to go on seeing you.
Not to deprecate your physical attributes, certainly, but because there is this feeling of danger about you, of something about to happen.
NICOLE: You're right, Willoughby!
Looks like we've just picked up a friend.
HAWK: Three minutes to go, Steinmetz!
This is your last chance!
JUDSON: Make your play, Hawk.
We're standin' pat.
I think Captain Steinmetz would have liked you, Mr. Judson.
You're his kind of man.
Thank you, ma'am.
Hey!
HAWK: Attention! One minute to zero!
Gentlemen, start your engines.
Here come the hostiles.
We're ready for 'em.
I think Captain Steinmetz would have liked you to wear this.
Why, I'd be proud to, little lady.
Mighty proud.
Power shovel number one, ready?
Ready, Mr. Hawk.
Full speed ahead! Go!
Fire.
Hey. Hey!
Stop! Help!
Cease fire!
Good shooting, Mr. Judson.
Thank you. That one won't bother us for a while.
Hurry! Move in with the crawler!
All right, Mr. Hawk!
Fire!
Please, stop it! No!
(LAUGHING) Ceasefire.
There goes another one.
We got the devils on the run. Fire!
(GROANING) Oh, no!
Are you all right?
Don't worry about me, ma'am.
What we gotta worry about, we're plumb outta ammunition.
This time we all go in together!
We got nothin' to regret, little lady.
We done our best.
Ready!
Drive! Drive!
Let's get goin'! Get outta here!
Hi, Grandma! Hi, there!
Why, that rascal!
She's got a man with her.
No wonder she wouldn't come to our party.
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Wait a minute! Back!
Why don't ya look where you're goin'?
How dare you raise your voice to me, you myopic oaf.
Hey! What do you think you're... Whoa!
All right, Herbie. That's enough now.
You think you're gonna make him stop?
Fat chance.
Herbie, if you don't stop, you won't be invited to the wedding.
Ah, it's you again, Mr. Hawk.
Save me! Save me!
They're after me! They're after me!
Who's after you?
Those little cars... Hundreds of 'em!
Can't you see them, you idiot?
Mr. Hawk, I wonder, would you mind coming down to my place of business?
I would be happy to.
I would... Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!
And what happened then?
Willoughby told Herbie that if he didn't stop, he wouldn't be invited to the wedding.
Wait a minute. What wedding?
(WEDDING MARCH PLAYING)

Who will rescue me
Oh, who will rescue me
Who will rescue me
I'm lost at sea
Without a friend
This journey
Will it ever end
Who will
Rescue
Me
Rescue me

Attention, please.
The economic and social council will convene in five minutes.
G-Good day, sir.
G-Good day, Mr. Ambassador.
How do you do, madam?
Order. Order.
This emergency meeting... of the International Rescue Aid Society is now in session.
Delegates, you have been summoned from all corners of the globe... because we have reason to believe that someone is in distress.
As you know, our society has never failed to answer a call for help.
Hear! Hear!
We will face the portrait of the beloved founder of our society, Euripides Mouse.

Mouse scouts, bring in the bottle.
Mr. Bernard, if you please.
C-C-Coming through.
Uh, pardon me.
Have a care there.
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.
Uh-- Excuse me, sir.
- Oops.
- Egad!
Delegates, this is no time for levity.
Serious business, you know.
Serious business.
Now what?
Sir, there, uh-- there-- there are
1 3 steps on this ladder.
Oh, superstitious nonsense.
What next?
Oh, um, sorry, sir.
I'll, uh-- I'll have it-- have it out in-in a jiffy, sir.
''To Morningside Orphanage, New York.''
It's difficult to decipher.
I can't make it out.
''I am... in terrible... terrible trouble.''
Oh, oh, dear, it's all watered out.
''Hurry.
Help. Penny.''
Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please... please, may I have this assignment?
You, Miss Bianca?
Dear lady, it's absolutely without precedent.
I mean, it's not like the old days when it was a man's world.
However, I suppose there has to be a first time.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca should go. It could be dangerous.
I mean, I mean, any-- anything could-- could happen to her.
You see, dear lady, before our janitor interrupted...
I was about to suggest that you should have a co-agent go with you.
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?
Gentlemen, this is indeed a-- a most difficult decision to make.
I choose...
Mr. Bernard to be my co-agent.
M-Me? Oh, th-that's-- that's really very, uh--
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.
Oh, come on!
Bravo! Bravo!
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.
Morningside Orphanage.
Here. H-Here it is.
Three blocks down and... uh, uh, four blocks over.
Well, why don't we take the shortcut through the zoo?
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--
I-I don't know. I mean, it's-- you know, it could be risky.
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?
Through storm and rain and dark of night--
Never fail to do what's right.
All right, duty calls.
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um, maybe we'd better go back.
It's so dark in there.
Dark?
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.
Wait for me!
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks down and, uh, four blocks over?
What did you do to make him so mad?
Nothing. He's just a-- just a grumpy old lion.
Well, after all, waking him up in the middle of the night--
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?
I didn't wake him up in the middle of the night.
I was walking through the thing, and he just--
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around, see what I can find.
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.
Boy, the things kids collect.
Do you think she could be still here in the orphanage?
Well, s-she can't be. It says on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''
Well, maybe she's been adopted.
No, because she would've taken these things with her.
- Mice!
- Cat!
Now, lookee here, you two... if folks find out that mice moved in here...
I-I'll get kicked out, lose my job.
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.
I'm a mite too old to be chasin' mice.
Uh, sir, could-- could you tell us what happened to a little girl named Penny?
I sure can. But you ain't gonna find her around here.
The poor little thing ran away.
When-- When was the last time you saw Penny?
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.
Let's see now. Uh--
The last time I saw her... she was sittin' over there on her bed, all alone.
She looked awful sad, and so I asked her--
What's wrong, Penny honey?
Nothing.
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.
You tell old Rufus, huh?
Well, it was adoption day at the orphanage.
Well, what happened?
A man and a lady came and looked at me... but they choosed a little redheaded girl.
She was prettier than me.
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.
You're something extra special.
No, I'm not.
Why, someday a mama and a papa will come to the orphanage... looking for a pretty little girl just like you.
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.
But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.
Well, faith is a bluebird... you see from afar.
It's for real, and as sure as the first evening star.
You can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same... making things turn out right.
Can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same, making things turn out right.
But whoever adopts me has to adopt Teddy too.
Oh, they'll love him.
He doesn't eat much, does he?
Oh, here!
I brought you something.
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!
No! They're ginger snaps!
Well, an old codger like me could use a little ginger.
I taked two extra ones for lunch today.
We're not supposed to do that.
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.
I love you, Rufus.
Gee, we'd better hurry, or we'll be late for supper!
She seemed happy enough, but the next thing I heard...
Penny was gone.
Well, aren't-- aren't the police still looking for her?
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.
I just can't believe that Penny would run away.
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.
Well, come to think of it, there was.
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.
Get in what? W-With who?
Oh, a weird lady tried to give Penny a ride... but she wouldn't have anything to do with trashy people like them.
Trashy people? Who?
She and her partner run a sleazy pawn shop down the street.
Miss Bianca, we must go down there and investigate.
Suit yourself, but you'd be wasting your time going down there.
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?
Bernard, uh, a child's book!
It's Penny's!
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.
W-What's so funny?
Y-Your tail!
Here, here, let me help you fix it.
Who could be ringing at this time of night?
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!
You've found the diamond!
Give you time?
You bungler!
You have been down there for three months.
Bottles? What bottles?
You caught Penny sending messages in bottles?
You blundering fool!
Can't you control a little girl?
Shut up! I am taking the next flight down to Devil's Bayou!
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.
Leave him for a few weeks and--
Oh, why won't this stupid thing close?
Out of my way, you road hog!
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4.
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does have to pack a few things, you know.
Will Mr.Jenkins report to the ticket counter, please?
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4, now departing.
Flight leaves 6:45.
Oh, no, we missed the flight.
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.
You know that flights are always late.
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.
Luck? Flight 1 3?
Maybe we'd better take the train.
Wake up.!
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?
Uh, h-h-hello?
Where have you been, oh,you lazy knucklehead?
W-We-We just got here, sir.
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent insisted on packing her, uh--
Look, bud, am I clear to land?
Traffc up here is thicker than fleas on a hound dog's--
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog-- road hog-- Crazy--
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.
Well, then give him the permission to land.
Uh, Captain, you, uh-- you have our permission to land.
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!
Doesn't he fly beautifully?
And you wanted to take the train, you 'fraidy cat.
'Fraidy cat?
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.
I mean, they serve, uh, Roquefort, uh--
Pull up! Pull up!
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.
Oh, great.
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.
Play it safe.
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville, little lady.
All right, all right, uh, it's most important we get to Devil's Bayou.
Well, now, will you just keep your shirt on?
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder in five minutes.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven... twelve-- Oh, no.
There are 1 3 steps on this ramp.
Well, why don't you jump the last one?
This is your captain speaking.
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.
Just sit back and leave the driving to me.
Miss Bianca, be sure it's fastened good and tight.
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.
Say, bud, read the checklist to me.
Uh, oh, yeah.
Goggles down.
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.
''If at first you don't succeed... try, try again.''
And here we go!
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Oh, I just love takeoffs!
Captain, you fly beautifully.
It's just like being on a ''roller scoater.''
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.
Come along
Will there be sunshine shinin'
Will we find a silver linin'
Come along
Sing a song
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow
Sing a song
Is it wrong
To put all our hopes together
And wish for somethin'better
Is it wrong
To be loved
To face the future with another
Who means more than any other
Is to be loved
We'll paint the grey clouds
With pretty rainbow hues
And we'll brush the gloom away
And save it for a rainy day
Rainy day
Oh, today
If troubles cast a shadow
And shadows make the sun afraid to stay
Why, it's okay
'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
And we'll find the silver linin'
Another day
Uh, listen to this.
It says here Devil's Bayou is uncharted and hazardous.
Each day's operations...
Hmm, interesting. must be...
Good night, dear. planned with... care and--
Tomorrow is another day
Good night, Bianca.
How I hope you'll always stay
Penny!
Penny?
Penny, answer me!
Penny?
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
That little brat has escaped again.
Nero, Brutus, bring her back, boys.
Why won't it start?
Snoops! What's wrong?
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.
Oh, shut up!
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!
Well, folks, we'll be landing at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.
Your crew thanks you for flying Albatross Air--
What in the--
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!
Bail out! Bail out!
Help!
Bernard!
Mayday! Mayday!
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?
Luke! Luke, wake up!
Luke, get down here!
It's Orville!
Oh, that Orville.
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!
I'm a-comin'.
Wow-wee!
This new batch really packs a wallop!
Look out below!
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.
Say, cousin, you look like you could use a swig of this.
It's good for what ails ya.
There.
Where are you folks from, anyway?
We're--
We're from New Y-- New York.
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna hang around this creepy place long.
Clear the runway!
Great balls of fire!
Holy smoke!
Why don't you watch where you're goin'!
Bernard, it's that terrible Medusa.
I'd like to give her a few whacks with my rollin' pin.
We swamp folks would like to run her clean out of our bayou.
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.
Why did you have to go and spoil everything?
Nero, don't you dare get my teddy bear wet.
Oh, it's that poor little young 'un.
She's tryin' to run away again.
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.
Hurry! We've got to find out where they're taking her!
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's got the fastest boat around here.
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!
Send Evinrude back as soon as you need help.
I'll round up the neighbors!
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!
You stop that, Brutus.
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Oh, dear! We've lost them!
Jehoshaphat!
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!
Help me, Bernard!
Help! Bernard!
Bianca!
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.
Keep trying, Evinrude.
Poor Evinrude.
Your carburettor is all pooped out.
Bring her right on in, boys.
Come on.
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?
Put me down, Brutus!
Cranky old dragon.
Nice work. Good boys.
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!
There, there, Teddy.
I won't let them do that to you again. Don't cry.
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.
All she ever thinks about is that simple bear.
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero and Brutus have your old teddy bear.
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em... like you are, Mr. Snoops.
Oh, don't you sass me.
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty little girl to her room.
I can go by myself, thank you.
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.
Look out! Here she comes!
Where is she? Where is she?
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.
Those leather-headed lizards of yours, they're supposed to be patrolling the island.
They let her get away.
Ha! My precious pets.
We know who caught that ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?
It was your brilliant idea to use the little girl for this caper.
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.
I know, I know. She's the only one small enough to squeeze down the black hole.
Yes, but why can't she find my big diamond?
I don't know, but-- but just look at these beauties that she brought up from the cave.
Oh, they'll sell for a lot of cold cash.
Ow!
I wish you wouldn't do that.
She's insane. Utterly mad.
I want that diamond.
I've got to have the Devil's Eye!
You didn't leave the girl down in the cave long enough.
She won't take orders.
You are too soft.
But the water was rising and the tide was coming in... and all she did down there was fuss about her teddy bear getting wet.
Snoops, you don't have a way with children.
You must gain their confidence... make them like you.
Yeah? How do you do that?
You force them to like you, idiot!
At the next low tide...
I am going to put her down there myself... and keep her there... until she finds it.
And it is as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.
Yes.
Now come along, petsy-poos.
We gotta get Penny out of here tonight.
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!
Let go, you-you-you, you big bullies, you!
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!
I mean now!
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!
Oh, Snoops, kill it!
Look! There's another one!
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?
Snoops! What's wrong?
I don't--
E-E-Evinrude, over here!
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.
That-- That-- That terrible woman!
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.
Wh-What can two little mice do?
R-E-S-C-U-E
Rescue Aid Society
But, Bernard, the Society's counting on us.
We can't quit now.
Oh, and that little girl.
We've just got to rescue her.
Rescue Aid Society
Heads held high
Penny dear!
Auntie Medusa wants to talk to you!
High tide or not... that little brat is going to find me that diamond... tomorrow... or else!
Come in. Come in.
Did you want to see me, ma'am?
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.
Now, I am going to let bygones be bygones.
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?
Yes, you want me to find that diamond.
That's right, dear!
But I've tried hard as I could, honest.
Of course you have.
But we must try harder, mustn't we?
Then please will you take me back to the orphanage like you promised?
Penny, don't you like it here?
A big, beautiful boat all to yourself.
But if I don't get back to the orphanage...
I'll never get 'dopted.
Adopted?
What makes you think anyone would want... a homely little girl like you?
Be brave, little one
Make a wish
For each sad little tear
Hold your head up
Though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you
Don't cry, little one
There'll be a smile
Where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you
Always keep a little prayer
In your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll bejoy and happiness
And your little world
Will be bright
Have faith, little one
Till your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave
Little one
Someone's waiting
To love
You
Good night, Teddy.
Sleep tight.
Oh, we almost forgot to say our prayers.
Please bless Rufus and Teddy... and all the kids at the orphanage--
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.
Because running away isn't working. Amen.
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--
We'll be all right.
Penny. Penny.
Yes?
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?
We found the bottle with-- with your message, and we've come to rescue you.
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!
Didn't you bring somebody big with you... like the police?
Uh, no, there's-- there's just the-- the two of us.
But if the three of us work together, and we have a little faith--
That's what Rufus said.
Faith makes things turn out right.
Penny, I know it's late, but we have to escape tonight, right now.
But I just got caught by Brutus and Nero.
Look what they did to my pants.
Yeah, and they're-- they're still down there guarding the gangplank.
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.
See there? The elevator.
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.
Great idea.
Now, uh, wha-wha-- what can we use for bait?
Oh, they'll eat anything.
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow the scent right into the elevator.
And I'll slam the door.
And would that make Medusa mad.
Brutus! Nero!
Did you let that little brat escape again?
You're too soft.
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.
That's exactly like Medusa.
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.
And we'll be so far ahead, they'll never catch us.
Wait a minute. She-- She might catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up wh-wh-while we're starting it?
W-We're in trouble.
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.
It's just got to work.
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--
I bet those two are up to something.
Gee, I don't wanna go down that awful black hole again.
Don't worry about that, dear.
You must hurry and get dressed.
Come on.
We haven't got much time.
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.
An-And hurry!
Ya-hoo!
Are you ready to help rescue that little young 'un?
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!
Luke! On your feet, you lazy critter!
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin' for someone to holler ''charge''!
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin' and get a-goin'!
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up, his nose gets plumb out of joint.
Take it easy, Gramps.
We gotta stay here till Evinrude brings us word from them mice.
If'n that bug don't get here soon... they'll put that poor little girl down the black hole again.
All right, you little brat. Now, you are gonna go down in that hole... and you are gonna dig till you find me the diamond.
You understand that?
And no sassing me.
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops, that is no way to speak... to our little Miss Penny.
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.
Now, my dear... you are going to find the big, shiny diamond... for your Auntie Medusa.
Aren't you?
Teddy doesn't like it down there.
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?
Ah. Poor Teddy.
I'll just keep him up here with me, where he'll be safe.
Give me back my teddy bear!
He's mine! He's mine!
You get down there and find the big diamond... or you will never see that Teddy again!
All right, all right.
I'll go.
Boss, you've really got a way with kids.
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.
I'll find her old diamond.
Oh, what a dreadful, frightening place.
Yeah, it used to be a pirates' cave.
How do you know that, Penny?
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for that diamond so we can get out of here.
Oh, I looked there already.
Medusa doesn't want those little ones.
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?
That's where the water comes in.
I'm afraid to go over there.
Well, if I was a pirate... that's just where I'd hide the Devil's Eye.
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.
Uh, come-- c-come to think of it... if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.
Bernard, look!
I can see something.
Come on.
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.
You-- You stay here.
I'll see if I can find a safe way over.
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!
- Help!
- I'm coming!
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.
Well, look faster.
Wow!
P-Penny, hold-- hold your lantern up again.
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.
Penny, we found it!
We found it!
Medusa, I found it!
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!
Back! Ah, good girl.
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.
Look, it won't go through.
I can't get it out.
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.
Stuck tight?
You get that diamond, or you'll never see daylight again!
No, no, back! Back, Penny!
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.
Not until you get the diamond.
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.
Penny! Penny, help!
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!
Faster, Snoops. Faster.
Pulling as fast as I can.
At last!
The Devil's Eye!
It's worth millions!
Just look at it.
Filled with power... for its owner.
Let me-- Let me look at it.
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.
But I know that there's enough there to cut it into two equal shares.
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?
And it's mine. It's all mine.
All yours? Half of it is mine, you double-crossing crook!
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!
Land's sakes!
It's Evinrude!
Oh, well, sure is a mess.
Where in tarnation you been, boy?
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be quitting now, must we?
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!
He's plumb tuckered out.
Here, son, this'll make a new bug out of you.
Charge! Ya-hoo!
We're gonna have us a rip-snortin' fight.
Yee-hoo! Charge!
Where'd everybody go?
I don't need any help from anybody!
Charge! Ya-hoo!
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.
If either of you try to follow me... you'll get blasted!
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.
Teddy goes with me, my dear.
I've become quite attached... to him.
My diamond!
My diamond!
Charge!
Now!
Now! Now!
Look out!
Oh, please start.
Advance the spark.
Not the horn, the spark lever.
Digger, hold this.
It's that doohickey on the steering wheel.
You-- You... and your infernal fireworks!
You-- You--
Oh, you dunderhead!
We're not getting any gas.
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!
Look out! The riverboat!
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!
Bernard, you're wonderful!
- We did it!
- We got her!
We sure showed that Medusa!
There goes... my diamond!
And because of a courageous little girl named Penny... the world's largest diamond, the Devil's Eye... is now in the Smithsonian Institute.
But what's even more important, folks... this little orphan's dream has come true.
Today she's being adopted.
-And here she is with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
From Morningside Orphanage
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage
You are a darling.
Penny,you were a brave little girl to do what you did all by yourself.
Oh, I didn't do it all by myself.
Two little mice from the Rescue Aid Society helped me.
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?
Yes, they rescued me.
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!
Hi, Bernard.!
You can talk to these little mice?
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.
Didn't you know that?
Well, uh, I didn't, but I do now, Penny.
Evinrude, what are you doing here?
It's another call for help.
Here, uh, uh... you're gonna need some volunteers.
But-- B-But, B-Bianca, we just--
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills... intrigue, travel, exotic places.
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.

- And how we celebrated your success.
Champagne, dancing the night away...
Oh, Georges.
Oh, ho!
Thank goodness.
Just in time.
Ah, Georges.
We're just a pair of sentimental old fools.
Now, Georges, do be serious.
I've asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.
Oh? Oh!
Splendid, splendid.
Who do you want me to sue, eh?
Come now, Georges. I don't wish you to sue anyone.
I simply want to make my will.
Will, eh? Will, will...
Now, then, who are the beneficiaries?
Well, as you know, I have no living relatives.
Naturally, I want my beloved cats to be always well-cared for.
Certainly, no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.
Edgar?
Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds?
This mansion? Your country chateau?
Your treasures, jewels, and...?
Oh, no, no, Georges.
- To my cats.
- To your cats?
Cats?
Yes, Georges.
I simply wish to have the cats inherit first.
Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.
Cats inherit first?
And I come after the cats.
I, me, after...
It's... it's not fair.
Whoo! I mean, whoo.
Each cat will live about 12 years.
I can't wait... And each cat has nine lives.
That's four times 12...
Multiply by nine times...
No, it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer than I'd ever live.
I'll be gone.
No.
Oh, no. They'll be gone.
I'll think of a way.
Oh... there are a million reasons why I should.
All of 'em dollars.
Millions.
Those cats have got to go.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first. Whoo.
Why should you be first?
Because I'm a lady, that's why.
Ha-ha. You're not a lady.
You're nothin' but a sister.
Oh!
I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.
Fight fair, Marie.
Females never fight fair.
Ow! Now, that hurt.
Mama! Mama!
Marie, darling, Marie, you must stop that.
This, this is really not ladylike.
And Berlioz?
Such behaviour is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.
Well, she started it.
Ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them.
Berlioz.
Now, don't be rude.
We were just practising biting and clawing.
Aristocrats do not practise biting and clawing and things like that.
That's just horrible.
But someday we might meet a tough alley cat.
That will do.
It's time we concerned ourself with self-improvement.
You want to grow up to be lovely charming ladies and gentlemens.
Now, Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting.
Yes, Mama.
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint before we start our music lesson?
Please?
Well, yes, my love, but...
- Whoops.
- ...you must be very quiet.
Uh-Oh.
Mm-hm. Mm-mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's Edgar.
Yeah, old pickle-puss Edgar.
"Old pickle-puss"? Now, now.
Berlioz, that is not kind.
You know Edgar is so fond of all of us and takes very good care of us.

Let's leave Toulouse to his painting.
Now, dear, you go to the piano. Now, run along.
Both of you, go ahead.
Yes, Mama.
It's time to practise your scales and your arpeggios.
Ouch!
I'm ready, maestro.
Ooh!
Mama, he did it again.

Oh. Good evening, my little ones.
Your favourite dish, prepared a very special way.
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Sleep well... I mean, eat well, of course.
Good evening, Duchess.
- Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort.
- Hi, Roquefort.
- Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort.
Mm. Something smells awfully good.
What is that appetising smell?
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?
Well, yes. I mean...
I don't mean to interrupt.
But...
But it so happens that I have a cracker with me.
Come on, Roquefort, have some.
Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do.
Just a few dunks.
Mm. Oooh. Very good.
My compliments to the chef.
Mm. This is yummy.
Mm.
Delicious.
Double delicious.
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.
So that's... crème de la crème... a la...
Edgar.
Ahhh!
Lafayette. Hey, Lafayette.
Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.
- Listen.
Wheels approaching.
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit six tyres today.
Chased four motorcars and a bicycle and a scooter.
Hush your mouth.
It's a motorcycle.
Two-cylinder, chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front, it sounds like.
You go for the tyres, and I'll go right for the seat of the problem.
How come you always grab the tender part for yourself?
'Cause I outrank you, that's why.
Now, stop beating your gums and sound the attack.
No, that's mess call.
Yeah, made a mess of it, huh?
You can be replaced, you know.
OK, let's charge. Oooh.
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.
I'm the one that says when we go.
Here we go.
Charge!
Whew.
Ahh! Oww!
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Heel, roll over, play dead!
Yow!
This sure beats running, Napoleon.
Step on the gas, Napoleon.
I got 'er wide open.
Oww!
Oh!
Oh, where am I?
I'm not at home at all.
Children, where are you? Answer me.
Berlioz?
Toulouse, Marie, where are you?
Here I am, Mama.
Marie, darling. Well, are you all right?
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.
Now, Marie, darling, don't be frightened.
Mama! Mama!
That's Berlioz.
Over here, darling.
Berlioz, here we are.
And don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
I'm coming, Mama.
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.
Mama?
Mama!
Darling.
That's only a little frog, my love.
He had a mouth like a hippo-lotamus.
Oh, what's so funny?
Not now, darling. Darlings, you just stay here.
I go and I look for Toulouse.
Toulouse?
Toulouse, where are you?
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
Toulouse!
Hey! What's all the yelling about, huh?
Why didn't you answer?
Mama, he's been here all the time.
Oh, thank goodness.
Are you all right?
I was having a funny dream.
Edgar was in it.
And we were all riding and bouncing along...
Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn't a dream.
- Edgar did this to us.
- Edgar?
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous.
Yeah, maybe you fell on your head, Toulouse.
Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.
Now, my darling, don't be frightened. You'll see...
Oh, dear. Let's get into the basket, all of us.
What's gonna happen to us?
Well, darlings, I just don't know.
It does look hopeless, doesn't it?
I wish we were home with Madame right now.
Oh, poor Madame.
She will be so worried when she finds us gone.
Duchess? Kittens?
Oh, my gracious.
I had the most horrible dream about them.
Thank goodness it was only a dream.
Oh, dear, what a terrible night.
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.
Oh, no! They're gone.
Duchess! Kittens!
Duchess! Where are you?
They're gone. They're gone!
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible.
But where? Why?
Good heavens. Anything could happen to them on a night like this.
Get washed down a storm drain, struck by lightning...
Oh, they'll need help.
I've just got to find them.
Duchess! Kittens?
Duchess!
Kittens!
Kittens!

Oh, thank you.
And what might your name be?
My name is Duchess.
Duchess.
Beautiful. Love it.
And those eyes.
Oooh.
Why, your eyes are like sapphires sparkling so bright.
They make the morning radiant and light.
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.
Of course not. That's pure O'Malley, baby.
Right off the cuff.
I got a million of them.
Oh, no more, please.
I am really in a great deal of trouble.
Trouble?
Helping beautiful dames... uh, uh, damsels in distress is my specialty.
Now, what's the hang-up, your ladyship?
Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris.
So if you would be just so kind and show me the way...
Show you the way?
Perish the thought.
We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side, with the stars as our guide.
Just we two.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Three?
Four?
Five?
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
- These are my children.
- Oh, how sweet.
Do you really have a magic carpet?
- Are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.
Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes
- that dazzle, too?
- Did I say that?
Yes, right off your cuff.
And you said we're gonna ride on your magic carpet.
Well, now, uh...
What I meant... You see, I...
No poetry to cover the situation, Monsieur O'Malley?
What I had in mind was kind of a sports model, baby.
- You know, one of those...
- Perhaps a magic carpet?
Built for two?
I wouldn't take up much room.
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.
Well, come along, darlings.
I'm a tough alley cat, too.
Hey, there.
You're coming on. I bet you're a real tiger in your neighbourhood.
Yeah. That's 'cause
I practise all the time.
Now, now, Toulouse.
Toulouse, come along, dear.
Yes, Mama.
See you around, tiger.
Now, that's quite a family.
Come to think of it, O'Malley, you're not a cat. You're a rat.
Right? Right.
- Hey, hey, hold up there.
- Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?
Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it's gonna be.
And it's gonna stop for passengers... wright... here.
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.
Another flight into the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?
No, no, no, baby.
You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.
Quick, Mom, get in here.
- But, children...
- Hurry up, Mama, hurry.
One magic carpet, coming up.
That's a magic carpet?
Sacré bleu!
Sapristi! Stupid cat.
Brainless lunatic.
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you could have lost your life.
So I got a few to spare. Nothin'.
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.
Bonsoir. Sayonara.
And all those goodbye things, baby.
Sayonara, mister...
Mama!
Marie! Marie!
Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?
And I'm so very glad we did.
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley, for saving my life.
No trouble at all, little princess.
And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.
Oh, I'm so sorry, but... we just couldn't.
You see, my mistress will be so worried about us.
Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets.
Oh, no. You just don't understand.
She loves us very much.
Poor Madame, in that big mansion, all alone.
In all our days, in tender ways,
her love for us was shown.
And so you see, we can't leave her alone.
She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could own.
Because with us she never felt alone.
Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you.
Did you have any luck at all?
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.
And I've searched all night.
I know. And poor Madame didn't sleep a wink, either.
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.
Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed.
Can you keep a secret, hmm?
Of course you can.
I have some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course.
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."
Aren't you proud of me?
So he's the catnapper.
The police said it was a professional, masterful job.
The work of a genius.
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?
Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me.
Not one single clue.
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...
My hat!
My umbrella!
Oh, oh, gracious.
I've got to get those things back tonight.
But... oh, you...
Why, that... sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.
But now we have to cook up a little spell.
You know. Ready?
All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose.
And tickle your chin.
Now you close your eyes.
And cross your heart.
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.
Hooray!
- We did it.
- Look, Mama, look!
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.
True.
True.
Sapristi!
Sacré bleu!
Thieves! Robbers!
Mangy tramps!
Take that and that!
Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.
I'll show him.
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.
Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home.
That's a long way off, so we better get moving.
Gee whiz.
Look at that bridge.
Come on, let's play train.
Now, be careful, children.
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.
Choc choo choo choo...
Clickedy, clickedy, clickedy, clickedy.
- Oh, no.
- Don't panic.
Down underneath here.
- Mama!
- Marie!
Oh, Marie!
Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!
Thomas! Thomas, up here.
Gee, Marie, why did you have to fall off the bridge?
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.
I'll see you downstream.
What beautiful countryside, Abigail.
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.
Amelia, if I walk much farther I'll get flat feet.
Abigail, we were born with flat feet.
I say. Look over there.
Oh. Oh, how unusual.
Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim.
He's going about it all the wrong way.
Quite. We must correct him.
Sir. Sir?
You are most fortunate we happened along.
Yes. We're here to help you.
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doing fine.
First, you must gain self-confidence by striking out on your own.
Go away. I'm trying to get to shore.
You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your mouth.
Indeed, not. Snip, snip.
Here we go.
Don't do that!
You're doing splendidly.
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.
Oh, he takes to water like a fish, doesn't he?
A very enthusiastic pupil!
No, no. This is no time for fun and games.
Gracious, Amelia.
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Bottoms up.
Deeper!
Look, Ma, there he is.
You really did quite well for a beginner.
Oh, Thomas. Thank goodness you're safe.
- Keep practising.
- And toodley-pip.
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?
Help? I've had all the help I can take.
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so much for helping Mr. O'Malley.
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.
Yes, we British like to keep things proper.
Now, I am Amelia Gabble and this is my sister...
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.
You might say we're related.
How nice. I never would have guessed.
Look, they got rubber feet.
Yeah.
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.
- Swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.
Thomas, this is Amelia and Abigail Gabble.
Yeah, honey, get those two web-footed lifeguards out of here.
Now, now, Thomas.
OK, OK, baby.
Hiya, chicks.
How awful.
We're not chickens. We're geese.
Nooo. I thought you were swans.
Oh! Oh, flatterer.
Your husband is very charming and very handsome.
Well...
Uh, you see, I'm not exactly her husband.
Exactly? You either are or you're not.
All right. I'm not.
Oh?
Hm.
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.
- Shifty, too.
- Look at his crooked smile.
His chin is very weak, too.
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts.
How romantic.
Please, please, let me explain.
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Well, girls, see you around.
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?
I think that's a splendid idea.
Oh, no.
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.
And, you dear, you take this place.
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.
We can't leave him, can we?
Mr. O'Malley, I think you should be the rear end.
Ready, everyone? Now, think goose.
Forward march.
Mama? Do we have to waddle like they do?
Yes, dear. Think goose.
When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo.
Waldo?
Yes, he's our uncle.
We are to meet Uncle
Waldo at Le Petit Café.
Le Petit Café? Oh, that's that famous restaurant.
C'est magnifique.
Sacré bleu!
Oh, he bit my finger!
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!
Good riddance!
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.
Uncle Waldo!
Abigail! Amelia!
My two favourite nooses.
Uncle Waldo, I do believe you've been drinking.
Oh, dear. What happened to your lovely tail feathers?
Girls, it's outrageous.
Why, you won't believe what they tried to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo.
Look. Look at this.
"Prime country goose à la Provençale.
Stuffed with chestnuts"?
And "basted in... white wine".
Basted? He's been marinated in it.
Dreadful.
Being British, I would have preferred sherry.
Sherry! Sherry.
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.
- You're just too much.
- You mean he's had too much.
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.
I say, there... what's all the whispering about, huh?
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!
Now, now, now, girls.
Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo.
Why, you'll wake up the whole neighbourhood.
- Sh. No!
- Neighbourhood!
Come along, Uncle Waldo.
Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going.
Oh. Right-o, girls.
Birds of a feather must... together.
That's "stick together".
Oh, stick.
Shush.
You know something?
I like Uncle Waldo.
Especially when he's marinated.
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.
Hurry, Roquefort, hop aboard the motorcycle.
And for goodness sakes, do be careful.
Frou-Frou, tonight Operation
Catnapper will be completed.
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!
I... Whoa!
Lafayette. Lafayette.
Listen.
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't nothin' but a little old cricket bug.
It's squeaky shoes approaching.
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.
Hush your mouth.
Let's see.
They're Oxford shoes.
Size nine and a half.
Hole in the left sole, it sounds like.
- What colour are they?
- They're black...
Now, how would I know that?
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.
I still say it was a little old cricket bug.
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.
It was a little old cricket bug.
I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon.
That's my hat. I'm the leader.
Well, shoot fire.
Don't get sore at me.
I ain't done nothin'.
Ooh. Oh.
Ooh.
Mm, mm. That feels good, Lafayette.
That's all right.
Mm. Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Oooh.
A little lower and faster there.
I'm scratching as fast as I can.
Oooh. Right there. That's good.
Oooh.
It's so warm... and cosy.
- Oooh.
- Aaah!
Oooh.
What's going on? Lafayette, what in tarnation you trying to do?
Aw, I get blamed for everything.
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?
What? And somebody stole my bumbershoot.
Where's my beddy-bye basket?
Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good.
This time I get the tender part.
Hush your mouth. Now, come on.
Hey, Napoleon, it's them shoes again.
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.
Napoleon, I'm plumb goose-pimply scared.
Now, this is no time to turn chicken.
I got a feelin' this case is gonna bust wide open.
Whoo-hoo!
Did you see him?
No, no, he sneaked up behind me and tailgated me.
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
Shh. Listen.
Sounds like a one-wheel...
- A one-wheel what?
- You're not gonna believe this.
But it's a one-wheeled haystack.
Hey, there it go. Come on.
After it!
I got him, I got him, I got him!
Ow! That's me.
Whoa, whoa. Oh!
Get him, get him.
Ooh. Ow.
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.
Ow. Oooh, oooh.
Criminently!
But, Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?
Mama, I'm tired.
Me, too, and my feet hurt.
Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed.
I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.
I'll bet it's more than a thousand.
Now, now, darlings, cheer up.
Mr. O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight.
How much farther is it, Mr. O'Malley?
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.
Oh! Oh, no.
Sounds like Scat Cat and his gang have dropped by.
- Oh, friends of yours?
- Yeah, they're old buddies, and they're real swingers.
"Schwingers"?
What is a "schwinger"?
You know, not exactly your type, Duchess.
Maybe we'd better find another place, huh?
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see your pad and meet your Scat Cat.
Well, OK.
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of that sweet stuff my way.
Well, lookie here.
Big man O'Malley's back in his alley.
Swing on down here, daddy.
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah.
Buona sera, paesano.
Welcome home, O'Malley.
Duchess, this is the greatest cat of them all.
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you, Monsieur Scat Cat.
Likewise, Duchess.
You're too much.
You are charming.
And your music is so...
So different, so exciting.
It isn't Beethoven, Mama, but it sure bounces.
Say, this kitten-cat knows where it's at.
Knows where what's at?
Why, little lady, let me elucidate here.

Happy dreams, my loves.
I'll bet they're on that magic carpet right now.
They could hardly keep their eyes open.
Such an exciting day.
It sure was, and what a finale.
Thomas, your friends are really delightful.
I just love them.
Well, they're kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you're ever in a jam, wham, they're right there.
And wham, when we needed you, you were right there.
That was just a lucky break for me, baby.
Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home.
Oh. I mean, your pad.
It's very nice.
Well, now, wait a minute.
This is the low-rent district, remember?
No, no, no, I like it.
Well, all it needs is a little tidying up, and maybe a little feminine touch.
Well, if you're applying for the job, well...
Goody. Mother's going to work for Mr. O'Malley.
Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires.
Gee.
That's pretty corny though, huh?
Oh, no. Not at all.
Any woman would like it.
I-I mean... even little Marie.
Yeah.
All those little kittens, Duchess.
I love 'em.
And they are very fond of you.
- Yeah.
- Shh.
You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.
Oh, Thomas, Thomas, that would be wonderful.
Darling, if only I could.
But why can't you?
Because of Madame.
I could never leave her.
But... But Madame's...
Well, she's just another human.
You're just her house pets.
Oh, no, no.
We mean far more to her than that.
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
We just have to go home tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you know best.
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.
And those kids...
Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.
Well, we almost had a father.
Yeah.
Let's go back to bed.
Good night, Duchess.
Good night, Thomas.
Hey.
Meow!
What a classy neighbourhood.
Dig these fancy wigwams.
Wigwams?
Are you sure we're on the right street?
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!
Oh, no. Edgar!
I've got to do something, quick.
Oh, ha.
Edgar, old chap, get used to the finer things in life.
Someday they're all going to be yours, you sly old fox.
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
Hooray! We're home.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first!
- It's locked.
- Come on.
Let's all start meowing.
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.
Uh, why?
Don't come in!
Go away!
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.
Hi, Roquefort!
He's glad to see us.
I don't know what to say.
I only wish that I...
Maybe just a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest.
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.
Bye.
So long, baby.
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!
Duchess, wherever have you been?
Look out for the... sack.
Well... guess they won't need me any more.
You came back?
It just isn't fair.
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.
Coming, Madame, coming.
I'll take care of you later.
Oh, Edgar, they're back.
I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.
Duchess? Kittens?
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you?
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
His name is O... what?
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...
Oh, never mind. Just run, move, go get him!
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.
I told you it was Edgar.
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.
I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady.
But I was so sure that I heard them.
I'm so sorry, Madame.
Mr. O'Malley!
Hey, stop!
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.
Butler did it.
Duchess and kittens in trouble?
Look, you go get Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats.
Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse.
Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you, and you won't have a bit of trouble.
No trouble, he said.
Well, that's easy for... for what's-his-name to say.
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.
What's a little swinger like you doing on our side of town?
Oh, please, I was sent here for help by a cat.
This is outrageous. It's crazy.
But honest! He told me just to mention his name.
So start mentioning name, rodent.
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.
Don't rush me.
His name is O'Toole.
I don't dig him. Strike one.
Oh, oh... O'Brien.
Strike two.
Oh, boy.
You believe me... don't you?
Keep talkin', mousey.
How about O...
Grady?
Huh?
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?
Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.
This little guy's on the level.
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level.
We didn't mean to ruffle you, squeaky.
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.
Come on, cats, we gotta split.
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!
Now, my little pesky pets, you're going to travel first class.
In your own private compartment.
All the way to Timbuktu.
And this time... you'll never come back.
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.
The baggage truck will be here any moment now.
Ooh!
Whoo-hoo. Oww!
Over there. They're in the trunk.
Quiet!
Everybody out of here, fast.
You are going to Timbuktu, if it's the last thing I do.
Well, Mac, this must be the trunk, eh?
Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu.
Heave-ho.
Now, my pets, a little closer together.
Good. Good.
Look, Georges. What do you think?
Very good, very good.
But I think we should get on with the will.
Yes, yes, of course, but you know what to do.
Very well. Scratch one butler.
You know, Georges, if Edgar had only known about the will,
I'm sure he never would have left.
Duchess, it's wonderful to have you all back.
And I think this young man is very handsome.
Shall we keep him in the family?
Of course we will.
We need a man around the house.
And, Georges, we must be sure to provide for their future little ones.
Of course. The more the merrier.
Now, don't move.
Smile.
Say "cheese".
Did somebody say "cheese"?
Thank you.
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.
Adelaide, what's that music?
Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.
That's exactly what they are, Georges.
They're the start of my new foundation.
What foundation?
My home for all the alley cats of Paris.

Fire alarm! Fire alarm!
[Man]
On the double! Move it!
[Man]
Move it, soldiers! Fire, fire!
It's Shoshone again, sir.
- And our wagon.
- Yes, sir.
Private Higgins and Corporal Albright took it to the supply depot last week.
This belonged to Corporal Albright.
Must have hit them coming out of Sam Young Canyon.
Stripped it and put the torch to it.
- Take care of the mounts, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Ravencroft, in the last three months, the army has lost... over 40 cases of Springfield carbines.
Twice that amount
of army issue handguns,
saddles, blankets and rations.
Enough to supply two forts this size.
And all those thefts
occurred in territory under
the protection of this fort.
I realize that, sir.
I want you to mount another patrol, Lieutenant.
Take as many men as you need, the best scouts we have... and find out what happened to those supplies!
- Yes, sir.
- Jim...
I'm running out of explanations to Washington.
If these raids don't stop... it could mean... my command here.
I understand, sir.
I'll leave immediately.
Boy, I sure miss Dusty, Donovan, and the kids... and that old dinner bell ringing on the farm.
Now don't start again, Amos.
Is that how you want to go down in the history books?
"After terrorizing the West, they ended up as farmers... milkin' cows and collectin' eggs."
- Is that what you want?
- Well, no, not exactly, but... boy, Dusty sure could make those biscuits and honey.
You just stick with me.
I tell ya, Amos, people are gettin' rich in these boom towns... and there's no reason why a couple of smart hombres like us...
- can't double or even triple our stake overnight.
- Double?
We got $300.43 now.
If we double that tonight, then we triple that tomorrow night, that'd be, uh...
- that'd be... carry the one...
- Kind of gets you to thinkin', don't it?
- Six... no, four... three...
- First thing we gotta do is get ourselves spiffied up.
- Then we'll take this town like Grant took Richmond.
- That's right.
I get ya now.
How do you think we go about...
Howdy.
Say, um, how do you figure going about that?
Well, uh, I'm still workin' on the particulars.
I'll tell you one thing: We ain't gonna dry gulch no one no more.
Yeah, and you ain't gonna get us mixed up in none of those bank robberies.
- Shh.
- Shh.
You want every punk gunslinger this side of the Rio Grande callin' us out?
You mean, make a rep for himself, Theodore?
Don't even use our real names.
We don't want no trouble with the law neither.
We're goin' straight from now on, Pard.
We're gonna live by our wits.
Wits?
Whoa.
Whoa, now.
- Miss Gaskill?
- Yes.
Yes, ma'am,
I'm Private Reid.
I was assigned to escort you.
Were all the officers busy?
Well, you see, there've been some problems at the fort, ma'am... and I guess they were needed for more important duties.
It's a bit warmer than I expected.
I'd best get some lighter clothing before we leave.
You can take care of this in the meantime... and get my things from the stage.
[Braying]
Well, what do you think, Clarise?
Huh? Yeah?
What's the matter?
Don't you recognize me? It's me.
- [Braying Continues]
- Oh, that. Uh, here. Take a whiff.
That's Eau deJasmine.
Direct from "Paree".
You wanna stop talkin' to that donkey?
- It's embarrassing.
- Yeah, oh.
Say, uh, Theodore... uh, Pard...
I was wonderin', before we take this town, I wonder if we could have our picture took?
Might not be a bad idea.
Might look good in the history books.
- Come on.
- [Donkey Braying]
Can't talk to you anymore.
It's embarrassing.
[Photographer]
There.
Does this have to be this tight?
Well, the purpose of a brace is so that you'll stay absolutely still.
I thought I was gonna be crouched down, like I'm gettin' the drop on somebody.
- Will you just listen to the man, Amos?
- And stay still.
Stay absolutely still.
[People Chattering]
[Braying]
What was that?
- Just take the picture.
- All right, now both of you take a deep breath...
- [Inhaling]
- And hold it.
One, two...
[Braying]
- Whoa!
- Don't let him near my equipment!
Amos, stop her!
Oh, my beautiful things!
Get me out of this!
Get me out of this!
You're going to pay for it.
I'll make you pay for it.
- You're making a shambles of my studio!
- Right. Gotta pay for this.
You're going to pay
for every cent of this,
or I'll have the law on you.
Oh, dear.
And bring back my headrests.
Theyjust came from St. Louis.
We only been in this town three hours... and already we got $70 less than we come here with... thanks to you and that dumb donkey of yours.
Yeah, don't worry. I got her tied up in some alley. She won't give us no more trouble.
Well, why didn't you just stop her before she busted up the whole place?
Because the guy taking the picture said, "Take a deep breath and hold it."
- Now how am I supposed to...
- Did you have to tell the man we're the Apple Dumpling Gang?
- Apple Dumpling Gang!
- Well, you're the one who said not to use our real names.
All right. From now on, just let me do all the talking, okay?
Then we won't get in these messes.
- Right. Okay, Theodore, uh, Pard.
- [Glass Breaking]
[All Shouting]
[Belches]
Why, you rotten...
Why, you filthy little...
[Grunts]
I don't tolerate hooligans and rowdies.
And any cowboy...
who tries to hooraw this town... will not live to regret it.
[Giggling]
Ladies.
[Boy]
Marshal Hitchcock, sir?
He's so handsome!
[Murmuring, Giggling]
- Who is that?
- Who's that?
Only Woolly Bill Hitchcock, the fastest-shootin', toughest marshal in the country.
You cross horns with him, he'll track you to your grave.
What do you think?
Oh, we got nothin' to worry about.
We're law-abidin' citizens now.
Matter of fact, first thing we're gonna do is open a bank account.
Now, is that different than openin' a safe?
- Come on.
- Probably.
Well, looks solid enough.
Couple of pilgrims out front.
- Well, take what we got and let's get out of here.
- In a minute.
I never made money so fast in my life.
They're comin' in.
All right, don't get walleyed.
You'll smoke out Woolly Bill.
Close the door.
Come on!
[Man]
Help you gentlemen?
Yes. We'd like to make one of them, uh... deposits.
How much you want to donate...
deposit?
The whole kit and caboodle: $230.
- That much, huh?
- And, uh... we want a "recipe" for that.
You're nobody's fool.
I can see that.
Any time you gentlemen want
your money back, you just... bring in this slip, and it'll be cheerfully refunded...
- with interest.
- [All Laughing]
We're on our way now, Pard.
[Man] Come on, Wes. Let's get
that money transferred.
Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Our president. A real go-getter.
- Give me a hand, Wes.
- You grab those two.
[Grunting]
Pleasure doin' business with you gentlemen.
[Amos]
Thank you.
Wh-Where are you going with the money?
Don't like to keep too much cash in one place.
Just not good business.
[Man]
I told you you was tryin'
to take too much.
These horses got all they can carry.
Put the rest on that jackass and let's get outta here.
You know somethin'?
They forgot to stamp the date on there.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll get that.
[Woman]
Help! Help! Help!
They're robbin' the bank!
The bank's been robbed!
Oh, blow it out your ear, sheep lover!
[Gunfire]
Look out!
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
Look what you've done!
What do you mean? If it hadn't been for me, you'd have been trampled by those horses.
A train would have been preferable to you!
Now get off of me!
- Well, let me give you a hand.
- [Screams]
- Let me get your bags.
- No!
Doesn't anybody understand what I'm trying to tell ya?
- The bank has been...
- Calm down, woman.
While you have been wearing out your mirror, the bank's been robbed.
They went thataway, stupid!
Amos, we have been taken.
They stole every red cent in this bank, includin' ours.
I'm gonna go report this to that
Marshal What's-His-Name. Come on.
[Grunts]
- Marshal, you're just the man we were looking for.
- Hold it right there.
- Yeah, b-but there were two men in here, and they th...
- All right, now.
Just turn around, remove your guns... and drop them...
- Huh?
- Nice and easy.
Want to show him this?
I said drop them.
[Bullets Ricocheting]
Ooh! Ow!
Marshal, I'm sorry.
We didn't...
Well, I'll be dipped.
They got Woolly Bill.
They outgunned
Woolly Bill Hitchcock!
[Laughing]
- Let's get outta here.
- [Laughing Continues]
It's a sight for sore eyes!
[Laughing]
Boy, if anybody sees us in these fancy duds, we're goners for sure.
You know, I knowed we never should have throwed away our clothes.
It was good for another three years.
Oh, here's your shirt.
Somebody throwed noodles in it.
[Crowd Murmuring]
Well, how'd they do it, Woolly?
- They must've snuck up behind ya.
- Let's get you over to Doc Sykes.
[Laughing]
I knew it would happen!
I just knew it!
They finally did it.
They got Woolly Bill!
- Two dudes did it. I saw it myself.
- Uh, did you hear that?
- Two dudes.
- Uh, probably from back East.
Woolly had the drop on 'em, and they still outgunned him.
They's faster than...
They's faster than scalded cats, them two.
And I ain't crazy neither.
I saw it myself.
Yeah, uh, you actually saw these two guys, is that right?
Well, I got to get over to The Clarion... and give my eyewitness report.
[Grunts]
[Laughing]
They did it!
They did it!
[Laughing Continues]
You know, since we went straight, we're in more trouble than we ever was.
- Can't we go back to terrorizing the West?
- We can't go anywhere, stupid.
We don't have money for train fare... and we can't ride that dumb donkey of yours,
'cause you can't find her.
Come on. Get dressed.
[Crowd Gasping]
They call theirselves the Apple Dumpling Gang.
- They what?
- Well, that's what they said, Mr. Hitchcock.
The Apple Dumpling Gang.
They's the same two that outgunned ya, Woolly.
[Hitchcock]
Yes, I see them.
I saw 'em myself, right after they shot the guns out of your hands.
Hard to believe, ain't it?
Did you really have the drop on 'em, Mr. Hitchcock?
He sure did. And that's the donkey the others lit out with.
Why, the gang must have split up.
Those are the two I want.
I'll keep this, if you don't mind.
Oh, of course, Mr. Hitchcock.
Glad to help...
anyway that I can.
- Our picture's never gonna get in the history books now.
- Oh, yes it will.
We'll go down as numbers 16 and 17 shot by Marshal Woolly Bill Hitchcock.
- Let's get out of here.
- Huh?
[Theodore]
You know, Amos...
we pulled a real slick one
on that Mr. Hitchcock feller.
He's gonna be ridin' all over the country lookin' for two dudes with checkered vests...
not a couple
ofhard cases like us.
I'd say we got it pretty soft.
Even be better if we had something to eat.
Don't worry about that right now.
We just lay low in this old barn till dark... then we just slip out of town and mosey off to other parts.
Ain't no way we're gonna be tied up with that bank robbery.
[Braying]
- [Theodore]
Clarise?
- Clarise!
Now, wait.
Don't be mean to her.
That's our way out of town.
Listen, people seen her hightail it out with that bank money.
Now she comes follerin'you
around like a hungry pup.
It ain't gonna take Woolly Bill long to put two and two together.
- Who's the other two?
- You and me and two ropes, that's who.
We gotta get rid of your mule and ditch that bank money.
- I thought you said we was goin' straight.
- Hush up. Let me think.
- Hey, Pard.
- Huh?
Is this how you make a capital T?
What are you doin'?
- What's the capital T for?
- Theodore.
Don't put my name on it, ya strawhead.
Just say, "Here's your money back, and we're sorry we caused you any inconvenience."
All right. Okay, that's, uh, in... uh, incon...
Inconve... Inconven...
Uh, could I just say,
"No hard feelings"?
- Just forget that for now and help me with this. Come on.
- Right.
[Grunting]
- You sure this is gonna work?
- You bet it's gonna work.
I got this figured out real scientific-like.
Now, when I count to three, we drop the bags, they swing right through the bank door... and Woolly Bill's got his money back.
- That's as easy as fallin' off a log.
- Don't say that.
You ready?
One, two...
- Oh, I forgot the note.
- Three-ee-ee.
- [Theodore Screaming]
- Where ya goin'?
[Screaming Continues]
[Belches]
- [Screaming]
- I'll get ya. I got... Hey!
- [Screaming]
- Watch the window!
[Screaming]
- Give me your hand.
Give me your other hand.
- Hold me!
- Come on.
- Hold me, Amos, hold me.
Whoa!
[Groaning]
- [Man] Looks like his neck.
- [Man #2] Hey, Marshal,
let me help you here.
Don't touch me.
[Groaning]
He looks like he's plumb hurt.
- [Muttering]
- Better get a doctor.
- [Grunting]
- I gotcha.
He got the money back, just like you said he would.
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.
- Huh? Yeah.
- We're with you, Woolly.
- [Groaning]
[Grunts]
Thank you.
Yes, sir. We gotta believe in this man.
- Get back.
- I don't see Clarise nowhere.
Will you forget about that donkey?
We gotta put some distance between us and this town... or it's gonna be our permanent residence.
And I mean permanent.
Follow me.
[Crowd Murmuring]
[Woman]
I just hope he doesn't go
into one ofhis long speeches.
Here's your rifle,
Mr. Hitchcock.
He's some kind of lawman, ain't he?
[Man]
He's the man. He's the man
that's gonna get 'em.
You can do it.
- Will you kindly assist me?
- Gladly.
[Crowd Murmuring]
[Groaning]
All right.
Easy does it.
- Watch your step.
- [Groaning]
[Man]
Just look at him.
- That's a fine figure of a man.
- Here, here.
Because those two cringin'...
pusillanimous polecats... returned some money... they shall not escape my vengeance.
Be assured, good citizens ofJunction City...
I will not rest until... the Apple Dumpling Gang... is completely destroyed... and removed from society.
- [Cheering]
- May I have my trusty steed, young man... if you don't mind?
Thank you.
That will do just fine, I believe.
Here we go.
[Groans]
[Man]
Watch out, there. Stand back.
[Man #2]
Give him some room.
That's it. Listen, listen.
I shall have their carcasses...
back in this town
in two weeks.
- Two weeks.
- [Crowd Applauding]
You can come out now,
Miss Gaskill.
- Are you quite ready now?
- Oh, yes, ma'am. That was the last case of champagne.
It's about time. I'll have you know I'm not in the habit of bein' kept waitin', Private.
- Well, after all, it is for your party.
- Especially in this condition.
And furthermore,
in the future, Private...
I will expect an officer to accompany me, and not an enlisted man.
And you can rest assured...
[Dialogue Fades]
For heaven's sake!
[Groaning]
Are you certain
you're takin'the right road?
I've ridden all over, and
I've never experienced anything
that compares with this.
[Groaning Continues]
Oh, is this the first time you've traveled this road?
Why, you rarely miss a rut.
Well, just shift in the saddle, so to speak. It only hurts half as bad.
As soon as we get to Fort Concho, my father's gonna hear all about this.
Well, if this comes to a court-martial... they might demand to see evidence of your complaint.
You forget your place, soldier.
- Giddyup, now. Ho!
- Merciful heavens.
Believe me, I fully intend
to give a detailed account
of your incompetence and your...
Uh-huh. Yes.
Appears we're on the same trail, my dear.
With your permission...
I'll just let you lead the way, hmm?
Whoa, now. Whoa.
And here we are.
Allow me.
- Millie!
- Oh, Dad!
- What's all this?
- You all right, darlin'?
- Daddy, you wouldn't believe what I've been through.
- What happened, Millie?
- Oh, Jim...
- Well, come on in and tell me all about it.
I'll be right with you, Millie.
I'll just get the bags.
Sergeant Slaughter?
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.
[Both Snoring]
- What is that?
- I don't know, sir.
Where did they come from, Reid?
I have no idea, Sergeant.
- Well, get 'em out of there.
On their feet.
- Yes, sir.
We're moving.
We're moving.
Now, who in blazes are you, and how did you get in an army conveyance?
Don't answer that.
I'll do all the talking here, Amos.
And besides, who wants to know?
I want to know!
You obviously don't know who you're talking to, Little Boy Blue.
I like that.
Where is your horn, Little Boy Blue?
[Chuckles]
- Get some coffee in them, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
At ease.
Now, gentlemen, come with me to the orderly room... and I'll explain the benefits of military life to you.
Free food, outdoor activity
in the fresh air...
the camaraderie
of soldiering... and that great feeling of belonging.
Now, gentlemen, come with me and I'll help you... with the little details of joining our group.
Now you're talkin', soldier boy.
After that, we'll take care of another little detail.
[Jim]
Hey, you, trapper... what do you got here?
I found him up there just this side of timberline.
Just like this.
It's Flint and Quinn, sir.
Yeah, I been hearin' that... military is payin' thirty dollars a head for deserters, dead or alive...
- so I put in for...
- Thanks for bringing them in... but that's all you get.
These two were killed on duty.
- Take care of them, Corporal, and bring those arrows to me.
- Yes, sir.
Just thanks?
That's all I get?
By gollies, l-l-I fetched them
a long ways.
Seems like you oughta... do... somethin' for somebody.
Gets so you can't hardly...
trust nobody no more.
Come on, boy. Let's go.
And you're certain
they're Shoshone.
Well, it could be Paiute, sir, but they're not usually this far west.
Then why can't we find any sign of them?
Where did they get to?
- What was in the wagon?
- Blankets, rifles, sidearms.
Well, that'll be sold to renegades.
- Put 'em with the other evidence.
- Yes, sir.
Jim.
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Washington.
Uh, yes, sir.
[Horse Whinnies]
Halt. Who's there?
Identify.
Halt!
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
We got a deserter!
Check back there.
Secure the gates!
Who is it?
I don't know, sir.
- Check the stables and sound assembly immediately.
- Yes, sir.
There he is!
What are you doing with these?
When you've been bucked and gagged for a few days... you'll feel more communicative, soldier.
Put him in the guardhouse.
Double the guard.
Company ready for inspection, Corporal?
- Ready for inspection, Sergeant.
- I'll conduct the inspection.
[Snoring]
- Is this company ready for inspection, Corporal?
- Sorry, Sergeant.
[Snoring Continues]
Did 'ems have a nice nap?
Because we don't want our new recruits to be cranky all day, do we?
- No, sir.
- When the corporal ordered inspection arms... he meant everybody.
Everybody!
Yes, sir. Yes, uh...
Oh, uh...
I'll just...
The order was for inspection of arms, soldier!
- Ooh!
- Sergeant!
Get... Get back in ranks!
Corporal, put these men on a trash detail for one month.
Now you listen to me.
For the next ten years, you are mine.
Do you understand?
Mine!
And I'm going to make soldiers out of you if I have to kill you in the process.
Corporal, take over.
I didn't have a very good night's sleep.
For talking in ranks, one month on the wood detail!
He didn't know about that rule, sir.
One month on the stable detail for both of you!
And report to me after this formation.
- Actually, it was his fault.
- And one month on kitchen police in the officers' mess!
[Violins]
You outdid yourself,
Ravencroft.
Yes, it's going to be quite an evening, isn't it? I want everything to go perfectly.
You do plan to announce your engagement this evening.
- I certainly do. I only hope that everything goes...
- Oh, there she is now.
Excuse me.
[Man]
You two.
[Knocking]
You two.
Give me a hand?
Take this in there, put it in the center of the table... and be careful.
Careful! Don't wiggle.
Don't spill it!
Be careful, you guys.
[Banjo]
Cake.
You're spilling it.
[Braying]
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Just officers and their friends.
I am an officer.
I'm a peace officer, and I'm looking for the Apple Dumpling Gang.
- And there they are.
- [Braying]
Hands up.
[Growling]
- How'd he ever find us here?
- Your mule, that's how.
Restrain that man!
[Gaskill]
Hold him, Corporal.
We're never gonna make corporal now.
We ain't even gonna make roll call.
I tracked 'em!
They're mine! Mine!
Get the fire brigade!
- [Men Shouting]
- Let's get out of here.
[Screaming]
Ooh!
What's going on here?
Oh, I might have known it.
Get some water and put out this fire!
- Over there!
- Water! Water. Oh.
[Shouting Continues]
[Bell Ringing]
You two!
Get the powder out of that shed
before the magazine goes up!
Corporal, get a bucket brigade started.
Fast.
Fire brigade, let's go!
Move it!
- Where are we supposed to put this?
- The man said get it out.
Hey, can you see what's burnin'?
I, uh, can't see... but, uh, it sounds like the whole fort's stirred up.
Yeah, well I'm gonna see what's happenin'.
Come on!
Get the water up there!
Come on.
Get those buckets in.
[Slaughter]
Come on, come on. Hurry.
[Slaughter]
Keep 'em comin'.
Pardon me.
Gimme that bucket.
[Screaming]
Get him outta there.
Get dirt on that fire!
Keep them buckets movin', movin', or we're gonna lose the mess hall!
Get the civilians out of the fort.
Open the gates!
Amos!
- There's no water over here!
- There's plenty over here, Theodore.
L-I could do that.
[Slaughter] Corporal, never mind that.
Bring your squad over here!
Hurry, hurry.
- [Theodore] Amos!
- Huh? Don't worry, I got her.
Amos!
Clear the area!
Get out of here!
Come on!
[Hitchcock Screaming]
[Maniacal Laughter]
Come on, Amos!
Come back, boys.
[Laughing]
Come here, boys.
[Gaskill]
Careful! Careful out there!
[Slaughter]
Come on, come on. Move it!
Hey, hey!
Get me out of here!
Get me out ofhere!
- Come on, hurry up!
- All right, all right.
Okay, soldier, grab a bucket.
- Yes, sir.
- Follow me. We need all
the help we can get.
Yes, sir.
Jim, get Millie out of the compound. This whole fort's gonna go. Stay with her!
Hyah, hyah!
Hyah! Move 'em!
Hyah!
[Millie Screaming]
Hyah! Hyah!
[Shouting Continues]
Theodore?
Theodore.
Better get that punch bowl back on the table.
That cook's gonna get mad.
[Bugle]
With your permission,
I'd like to take out a squad to look for Millie.
I'm sure Private Reid took her hostage.
We have four patrols out already, Lieutenant... and we are presently reduced to a skeletal force... that couldn't defend these shambles against a stiff breeze!
Through the years, this proud fort...
Fort Concho, has withstood seven Indian assaults... four sieges, plague... drought, the blizzard of'68... and an outbreak of acute dysentery.
- We weathered them all, Lieutenant...
- Yes, sir.
Never once dipping our colors.
Then, in less than four hours... two of our own men... those two...
brought Fort Concho
to its knees.
Even if I could explain to Washington what happened... they'd never understand.
I know those people back there.
Yes, sir. Um, why don't you try to lie down, Major?
Because my quarters are destroyed!
I have no bed to lie on.
Corporal, tell these two men...
that they're gonna
hang there in the sun
for the next three days...
with just enough water
to keep them barely alive!
Then they're gonna be cut down, and they're gonna rebuild this fort... piece by piece, log by log... even if it takes the rest of their lives!
You two men are gonna hang there in the sun for three days...
I think we heard him, Corporal.
[Groaning]
Say, Theodore, how long you think it's gonna take us to rebuild this fort?
Well...
[Growling]
I don't think we're gonna have to worry about that.
- Mornin', Mr. Hitchcock.
- We was just hopin' we'd run into you, Mr. Hitchcock.
It-It's about that, uh... you know, back there in Junction City...
For bank robbery...
[Neck Muscles Crack, Groans]
For destruction of private property...
for creating
a public nuisance... for interference with an officer in the performance of his duty...
for illegal flight
to avoid prosecution...
I didn't know we did all those things. You, Theodore?
And miscellaneous
misdemeanors...
I am going to put you out of your misery... and take you back toJunction City...
draped over the back
of your own mule.
Don't we get to stand trial?
You forfeited the right to your trial... when you made me follow your jackass all over the countryside.
Mr. Hitchcock has a point there,
Theodore. We did put this man through an awful lot of trouble.
Will you just shut up.
Now, we got a fort to build here, Mr. Hitchcock. But just as soon as we're finished here... we'll meet you back at
Junction City, and then you can put us out of our misery then.
Save your breath.
You are both going to be shot between the eyes.
I won't make it any easier on you... but I will make it... somewhat of a challenge for myself.
You oughta get some butter on those hands.
[Grunting]
[Gun Firing]
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Let me go! Let me go!
You're interfering with a police officer in the performance of his duty!
They're not gonna get off that easy.
They're mine for the next ten years. Do you hear me?
Mine! Mine!
Corporal of the guard!
[Millie]
But why did you kidnap me?
[Reid] Darlin', you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It was not for your company,
I assure you.
Do you think you can elude the entire garrison?
I am gonna try.
You do seem awfully familiar with the back trails around here.
Most of'em.
I have to be.
You're involved with these military thefts, aren't you?
That should be pretty obvious by now.
You'll be shot when they catch ya.
Well, that's the chance you take in this business. Giddyup!
Hello, in the cabin.
Hello!
Whoa.
Hello, Jeff.
Howdy, Martha.
Excuse me.
- Allow me.
- I can get down myself, thank you.
Who's that with you, Jeff?
Miss Gaskill, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine,
Mrs. Martha Austin.
Well, I'm not his friend.
I'm his prisoner, and I plead to you as another woman to help me.
Lot of women wouldn't be all that upset over your predicament. Come on in.
Leave the flowers, Jeff.
There's more.
How 'bout you,
Miss Gaskill?
No, thank you.
I'm thoroughly exhausted.
- I'd like to lay down if I may.
- Of course.
Just as soon as you finish the dishes,
Miss Gaskill.
You want to wash or dry?
And in the morning...
we'll see about rebuilding
that woodpile, Martha.
Excuse me.
Now, how much more of this do we have to stack?
Well, Miss Gaskill, you're just gettin' off to a good start.
Uh, Miss Gaskill,
let me, uh...
Let me save you some steps there.
Here ya go.
Put your arms out. Good.
Hold on, hold on.
- What do you mean, "Hold on"?
- Here we go.
- That's enough.
- Just one more. One more. There we go.
There. Lieutenant Ravencroft would be very proud of you.
Oh, I swear, when they find us, you're gonna get what's comin' to you.
Well, in that case, we better hurry up and get this wood chopped. Come on. Off you go.
- I can't!
- Whoa!
- Are you all right, Millie?
- Would you get your hands off me?
It seems that I'm all that's between you and a very nasty fall...
- and you should be thankin' me.
- Please?
Well, I didn't know that army brats knew that word.
[Screams]
There you go.
[Major]
Prisoners, front and center, ho!
A court-martial has found you guilty of... more charges than I care to enumerate at this time...
- but enough to commit you to Bridger Military Prison...
- Oh, they're mine.
All mine. Oh, yes, you see,
I caught them, and so, they're mine.
There's nothing to worry about.
I have everything under complete control.
They're mine! Mine, all mine!
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
Whatever's fair.
We don't want to cause any trouble.
To Bridger Military Prison, where you will remain at hard labor for 30 years.
I regret that is the maximum
penalty the law allows.
I want to add... that I am being relieved of my position here.
Two weeks from today,
Lt. Ravencroft will be promoted...
and will assume
command of the post.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Mmm-mmm.
I can say without reservation... that I have... you to thank for it!
Sergeant, Corporal.
[Horse Neighing]
- Take them away.
- [Soldier] Move.
[Hitchcock Laughing Maniacally]
I'll be waiting for you!
If it takes a hundred years,
I'll get you!
I'm going to get you!
[Crazed Laughing]
- Move 'em out!
- [Soldier] Detail, move.
[Hitchcock's Laughter Continues]
My, how you manage by yourself I'll never know.
Don't you get lonesome way out here?
The Norwoods live upstream a ways.
They look in on me once in awhile.
But I don't miss anything.
I've lived my life, and it's been a good one.
Martha, where did you ever meet Private Reid?
Jeff? I didn't even know he was in the army.
I just know he's a good man.
A good man! Why...
Why, he's an arrogant scoundrel and a disgrace to his country!
Oh, I don't know. I do know he has a much higher opinion of you.
Oh, really.
He loves you.
Loves?
Loves me?
Oh, now whatever gave you that idea?
I can hear it every time he speaks to you.
Every time he says,
"Miss Gaskill."
It's filled with love.
You're a lucky girl.
[Horse Approaching]
- Captain Phillips.
- [Phillips] Lieutenant.
- Seen any patrols?
- No, sir.
Not a sign.
Good to see you.
[Chuckles]
I got something for ya.
Colonel Stevenson, who hopes you're well.
And that I've got something definite to report on these army supply thefts, I'm sure.
Well, there was some mention of that, yes.
You know, I haven't got one solid clue yet, Lieutenant... but all indications are that the answer is somewhere inside Fort Concho.
Right now I need some more help
from you and Colonel Stevenson.
First thing, I'd like to get some new I.D. Papers... a little bit more cash...
Oh, hi, Martha.
It's me.
- She's gone.
- What do you mean? Where is she?
I didn't think she'd have the salt to try it on her own, but she did.
- Martha, she...
- She'll be all right, Jeff.
If she sticks to the stream, she'll come upon the Norwood place.
They'll give her a hand back to the fort.
[Sighs]
And Lt. Ravencroft?
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I truly am.
Hey, they're here.
They sure ain't taking any chances with them guys.
Wonder how fast they really are.
I don't want to be the one to find out.
Everybody sure has been nice to us, Theodore.
The guy who gave us these uniforms, wanted to make sure they fit. Even called us "sir."
That's because they think we're the fastest guns in the West.
- Well, we did get Woolly Bill.
- On the first bounce.
If it ever gets out what really happened in that bank, we won't last a week in here.
- What are you gonna do?
- First, we gotta find out who's really running things here.
- Once we back him down, we got no more problems. You got me?
- Right.
[Unlocking Door]
[Prisoners Chattering]
Psst.
Remember who we're supposed to be.
- [Shuddering]
- All right.
Who's the number one cock-a-doodle-doo around here?
- W-What?
- "What?"
[Grunts]
- Now, who is he?
- It's-It's Mac! It's Mac!
- Mac who?
- Uh, I don't know.
They just call him "Big Mac."
Where is this
Big Mac?
I don't know.
[Panting]
Not many of these fellas have ever seen him.
Big Mac don't, don't never come out here in the yard, n-never.
Well, you get word to this, uh, Big Mac... that the Apple Dumpling Gang wants to see him.
Okay?
Uh-h-h,
Apple Dumpling Gang.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[Straining]
- Move out.
- Y-Yes, sir.
- Move it!
- [Gasps] Yes, sir!
[Man]
One, two, three. Heave!
[Bugle]
Sometimes I wished we'd left
Marshal Hitchcock to his own devices.
- How's he doing?
- He's been released from the infirmary.
Not all together cured,
I'd say, but better.
About the robberies, Jim,
I hate to pass on unfinished business... but I did everything
I knew how.
You did everything humanly possible.
But it wasn't enough.
They stole another cavy of horses just two days ago.
- I'm beginning to think these raids are done by ghosts.
- It's uncanny, sir.
Well, it's off my shoulders now.
Daddy, it's unfair.
Nothing is fair in this world, Millie.
I'm sorry about your wedding plans, but you could hardly stay here under these conditions.
Now you know I'll be all right.
You don't have to worry about me.
We'll be married just as soon as I take my leave, sir.
Hey, Theodore, when we get out of here in 30 years, are we gonna go straight again?
I'll think about that when the time comes.
Listen, did that guard say to go left or right when we passed them boilers?
He said to go right.
This is a strange place for a shipping room.
I don't think we're supposed to be down here. We must've made a wrong turn somewhere.
Uh, where...
- [Gasping]
- Uh, Theodore?
- Theodore, what did you do?
- [Men Chattering]
- Shh.
- [Man] It'll be a week
or so till we get the cash.
- We'll make the split then.
- You did a goodjob. No witnesses.
- That's the way I want it.
- [Whispers] Amos.
You boys have had it pretty easy up till now.
But I wanna tell you,
holdin'up a train isn't easy
as them wagons.
There'll be plenty of guards around that payroll.
We'll take care of the guards.
Reno, you're in charge.
Blainey, go along with him, make sure there ain't no mistakes.
Now I'll be waiting in the meadow at the Cuddy Grade.
You work your way up to the baggage cart, throw the money out there.
Stay on the train till you
get to Oakdale, then get off.
If everything goes well,
I figure we should be able to meet back here in 45 minutes.
An hour, at the outside.
$50,000 an hour.
That's pretty good pay.
[Gasps]
Uh, could you direct us to the
Bridger Military Prison, please?
Who the blazes are you?
Ya ever hear of the
Apple Dumpling Gang, punk?
Why didn't you say so?
I hear you wanna see me.
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.
Whose little boy are you?
[Chuckling]
I'm Mac.
Mac who, fuzzy face?
That Mac.
Probably wants to talk to you.
Uh, we just wanted to say howdy.
Howdy.
How long were you there and what'd you hear?
Oh, nothing.
We just got here, Mr. Mac.
We didn't hear nothing about any train robbery, did we?
No, no. Didn't hear nothing about the money either.
- Boys.
- Wait a minute.
Mac, we can use a couple of extra guns on this job.
Yeah, I hear you boys are pretty handy with the iron.
That's right. Pound for pound, we're the best in the West.
[Big Mac]
Well, good.
Yes. [Chuckling] Well, here.
We'll give you a chance to prove it.
[Chuckling]
Well, now that's what I call shootin'.
Maybe we can use you boys.
Uh, are you gentlemen prisoners here?
When we feel like it.
It ain't all that surprisin'
when you know the story.
See, Bridger here was built by army prisoners.
When they was digging the foundation, they found these caverns.
[Chuckling]
A few of the boys just kept it under their hat.
Figured they'd use it later to bust out.
[Chuckles]
But it turned out to be the perfect hideout.
Now, where's the last place the law would look for a person that was robbin' a supply wagon?
Why, that's a toughie.
Now, where is the last place...
- Prison.
- Huh?
You got a head on you, boy.
Just barely.
So we figured why bust out and be on the dodge the rest of our lives.
Stay in prison and run the whole operation from here. Live like kings.
Come and go when we want.
Feel the need for a little relaxation, a little female companionship... we just ride into town.
Makes life in prison very comfortable.
Does Warden Waddell know about this?
No! Nobody does, but the seven of us.
Well, nine of us now and the outside man.
- Who's that?
- You'll meet him when the time comes.
The outside man lets us know when there's a wagon... or a shipment coming through with somethin' worthwhile on it.
He gets a cut
for his trouble.
You'll get yours too
if you handle yourselves
all right.
We'll be watching ya.
[Chuckles]
We'll slip into town one or two at a time.
- You two know where your spot is?
- The Variety Saloon.
I want everyone in place at 12:00 sharp.
And you better be there.
Don't worry.
Giddap!
Come on!
You know, Theodore.
Robbin' army payroll ain't exactly goin' straight.
We ain't robbed no payroll yet, Amos, and we ain't goin' to.
I'm thinkin' on a plan.
Better come up with it by noon.
If you don't have it by noon...
Wait for me.
All we gotta do is have the sheriff in this town...
Iock us up under protective custody.
Then we just lay back and let him handle the rest. We'll be heroes.
If you're looking for Sheriff Vaughn, he's over at the Widow Bradshaw's.
Seems a fox has been gettin'
into her chicken house again.
Hmm! Usually takes the sheriff about a week to settle the matter.
- A week?
- Yeah, we can't... A week?
We can't wait a week.
I mean, already the little hand's on 12, big hand's on 11.
You need a lawman, the federal marshal's
down at the Variety's.
- Let's go! Come on!
- Hey, Theodore.
Are we in more trouble here or back in Junction City?
When you're in this much trouble, it can't get worse.
[Clears Throat] Howdy.
Uh, we're lookin' for the marshal.
We've got a marshal here, of sorts.
But I don't know as he can handle your complaint though.
- I'm sure he can.
- Oh, sure he can. Where is he?
Right over there.
- [Groaning]
- It's the famous Marshal
Woolly Bill Hitchcock.
He's just a shell of a man he was before the Apple Dumpling Gang got away from him.
- Shall I wake him up?
- [Both] Uh, no, no.
- Let him sleep. We're just leaving.
- Thank you very much.
- Where's the backdoor?
- In the back.
Amos!
[Screams]
It's noon.
Whiskey.
Where's the two new gunslingers?
They'll be here.
They better.
Where we goin'?
I can't see.
I don't know.
Just act nonchalant.
- Hey, look, a couple of girls.
- [Men Whistling]
[Both Stammering]
[Man] Come down here, girls.
Let's dance!
- Remember them?
- The bank robbers?
- [Man] Play a tune, Charlie.
Maybe they'll dance.
- Big Mac.
[Piano, Cancan]
Woolly Bill.
- They're all here.
- Hey, come on!
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna dance. Come on.
[Men Cheering, Whooping]
- How long do we have to keep this up, Theodore?
- I don't know.
- Come on. Let's dance.
- [Gasps]
Hey, play something we can dance to.
[Moans]
Whoops.
["My Darling Clementine"]
Come on, honey.
Don't play hard to get.
- You're for me. I like mine with a little meat on 'em.
- [Mock Laughter]
Ain't we seen you two gals somewhere before?
- [Falsetto Voice]
We do get around.
- Ah.
Been a long time since I had my arms around a little hug and squeeze like you.
[Falsetto Voice]
I bet you say that to all the girls.
- [Mock Laughter]
- [Man Laughing]
Nah.
We gotta get out of here or we're in big trouble.
Oh, I don't know.
Mine's a pretty good dancer.
It's gettin' late.
Yeah.
We better get out of here.
If I ever get my hands on those two, I'll kill 'em.
You know, I can't get over the feelin' that I've seen you somewheres afore.
Oh, I'm just another pretty face.
[Chuckles]
Listen, gorgeous.
Why don't we get out of here?
- I'd sure like to get to know you a little bit better.
- [Mock Laughter]
[Coughing]
[Braying]
Hey, Teresa.
Look, it's Clarise.
- [Gasps]
- Uh, Teresa, Clarise is back.
- Let's get out ofhere!
- [Grunts]
Thanks for the dance, honey.
- Come on!
- Come on, Clarise.
- Theodore!
- [Moaning]
[Gasps]
[Chuckles]
[Theodore]
Amos. Amos.
[Screaming]
- You okay, Theodore?
- You bet, Pard. Thanks.
Get me down!
Get me down from here.
Let's get outta here!
- Wait a minute, Theodore.
Where's Clarise?
- Amos, forget about her!
- Clarise!
- Amos, come on!
Come on, Clarise.
Amos! Come on, Amos!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, you two!
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?
Well, I still feel funny about Clarise, Theodore.
Will you forget about that!
A deal's a deal.
At least we're puttin' some miles between us and Big Mac.
You got a point there. I guess we can kind of relax and just sit...
- [Gasps] Hey! Isn't that, uh...
- [Gasps]
That's Reno and Blainey
and the whole bunch of'em.
They're comin'right at us.
Duck!
- Let's get on board.
- Now, move it, you guys.
We ain't got much time.
[Conductor]
All aboard!
They're comin' in here.
- Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
- That army payroll.
- It's on this train!
- Let's get outta here!
- [Train Starts Moving]
- [Both Scream]
[Grunts]
[Gasps]
You!
We can't go on meeting like this, Miss Gaskill.
Or is it Mrs. Ravencroft?
Well, there's been a slight delay in our plans.
Wonderful.
- What are you doin'?
- Just something I've wanted to do for a long time.
My, if you would've put the same amount of effort into somethin' worthwhile, why...
Get back to your seat and stay there.
Who are you to be telling me what to do?
I am Captain Jeff Phillips of Army Intelligence... and I'm on special duty here trying to find out who's behind these...
- military supply robberies at your father's fort.
- Captain?
We'll have time to talk about it later.
There's a large army payroll on this train.
I have reason to believe they're gonna try and get it.
- I don't want you shot before we get married.
- Married?
Now get in there and stay put.
[Sighs]
[Man]
Over here, Mac.
It's, uh, not that
I don't trust you, Mac.
But since it's cash this time,
notjust supplies...
I thought it'd be easier if wejust
divvied it up here, right at the scene.
- Your boys know this spot?
- Don't worry about them.
They're all good at theirjobs.
Well, they oughta be.
I pay 'em enough.
Well, if that train left on time, oughta be here in less than five minutes.
I'll be glad when that money's off this train.
If we just keep movin' and stay buttoned up, everything'd be all right.
[Train Whistle Blowing]
And the cap.
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
- Thank you. Tickets, please.
- What was that, Theodore?
I don't know.
And it's Running Bear, not Theodore.
- Yeah, but, Theo...
- How many times do I have to keep telling you?
I'm Running Bear and you're Standing Elk.
Now, hush up!
[Blainey]
I saidjump!
[Screams]
Uh, Running Bear...
Standing Elk just saw
Screaming Eagle and Flying Corporal.
[Chuckles]
It was just, uh...
There's not much time.
Unlock that door.
[Grunting]
[Whooping]
[Man]
It's Indians!
- [Gunshots]
- [Passengers Chattering]
I wonder what they want.
Hey. Aah! Theo.
- What's goin' on out there?
- [Whooping Continues]
Indians. The Indians have been peaceful for years.
- I wonder what stirred them up?
- I don't know.
But I don't like it.
Let's get outta here.
- [Man Speaking In Native Dialect]
- Oooh.
- [Passengers Shouting, Screaming]
- Get down!
Check the women!
I think those two are lookin' for us.
Yeah, but, uh...
I think I'd rather rob a train.
[Gunshots Continue]
Hi, Reno. It-It's us.
Do ya need any help?
Where you two been?
Get in here!
- I knew you had enough help...
- Come here.
[Speaking In Native Dialect]
[Screams]
[All Grunting]
[Whooping Continues]
[Amos]
Oh, boy, look at that.
I thought you people just wanted guns and beads.
There's nothin' in there but bills. Show him, Reno.
Yeah.
No want paper.
Want them.
- [Gasps]
- White man trade donkey with my squaw for two blankets.
Then donkey run away.
Dirty white man trick.
Squaw want blankets back.
You got 'em, chief.
- Give me these!
- I, uh...
[Laughing]
[Stammering]
Come on, Mac!
Get on with it!
All right, everybody got what they want? Now we can all get down to business.
Not quite. I haven't got what I came for.
Millie. Private Reid.
It's Captain Phillips, Lieutenant,
U.S. Army Intelligence.
You and your sidekicks
are all under arrest.
- Get the bags.
- So if you'll kindly dismount,
very slowly, please...
drop your arms,
you can all ride...
Amos, what are you doing?
- I'm trying...
- Will you please hurry and help...
[Screaming, Grunts]
[Reid] Hey! Who is that?
What's goin'on there? Hey!
- Who is that down there?
- Oh, Amos and Theodore, Captain.
Remember us, from the fort?
Yes, good work down there, soldier... uh, uh, men... uh, good work.
- Phillips, you can't arrest me.
- Oh, yes, I most certainly can.
- You don't have anything on me.
- We'll see about that, Lieutenant.
Your entire operation will be closely examined at your general court-martial.
And in the meantime,
you and your sidekicks here...
can ride back in the baggage cart,
if you don't mind, sir.
Right there.
Right there, right there.
Right, right.
Right there. There.
Well, move it.
[Chuckles]
All right, come on, come on, come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
"It was a distinctive gold coin... spent at the Variety Saloon that led to the capture and..."
- What's that?
- "Incarceration."
- That means to "cart 'em back there."
- Right.
"...incarceration of the real bank robbers,
Wes Hardin and Frank Starrett.
"Mr. Hitchcock, in a statement to The Clarion...
"said he knew all along the Apple Dumpling Gang was not guilty... but he wanted the real robbers,
Hardin and Starrett, to relax their v-v-v..."
- What's that?
- "Vigilance."
- It means to "rest their horses."
- Oh.
Kids'll be surprised we got an honorable discharge from the Army.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]
- When do you think we'll be home?
- A day and a half.
- That'll be Tuesday.
Boy, I hope there's some of that leftover pot roast.
I bet Mr. Donovan and Dusty'll be real surprised to see us.
Yep. I'll bet that place is a rack and ruin since we been gone.
Someone once said if it was raining brains...
Roxy Robinson wouldn't even get wet.
Roxy spent his life making two and two into five.
He could smell trouble like others smelled gas.
But believe you me...
he shouldn't have taken that alley by Parito's bakery.
Your name Robinson?
Roxy Robinson?
You work for Fat Sam?
Whatever game it was, sure as eggs...
is eggs, Roxy the Weasel had been scrambled.
I should be filling you in.
This guy's the hero of our story.
Name of Bugsy Malone.
A nice guy, a little too popular with the broads.
Italian mother, Irish father. Grown up confused.
Kinda mixed up. By the way, my name's Sam.
Fat Sam, because of my physique.
I ain't no dumb-bell.
And this ain't no bookshop.
This is my place.
Fat Sam's Grand Slam.
Best joint in town.
- Hi, Jelly.
- Hi, Bugsy.
We interrupt this program to bring you a news flash.
We have reports of an incident on the Lower East side...
involving the man known as Roxy the Weasel.
Believed to be a member of the gang of mobster king...
Fat Sam Stacette.
Robinson was the victim of a...
sensational event.
We go over to our reporter on the spot...
So tell me.
How'd you allow this to happen?
Roxy was one of my best!
What have you got to say... you bunch of dummies?
Call yourselves hoodlums?
You're a disgrace to the profession. You hear me?
And most of all, a disgrace to me. Fat Sam.
And we all know who's behind this.
Sure do, boss.
Don't need a hatful of brains...
- do you?
- Certainly not, boss.
So who is it, dummies?
Tell me! Who?
- Dandy...
- Dan.
Don't mention that name in this office!
Take it easy, boss, sit down.
Come in.
I'm Blousey Brown. I'm a singer, for the audition.
A singer. A singer!
I don't need a singer.
Come back tomorrow.
How about my audition?
You said okay last week.
Am I going mad? Are my ears playing tricks on me?
Will you get out of here!
Dancers, dancers, surrounded by namby-pamby dancers... singers, piano players and banjo players... when I need brains.
Brains and muscles.
You've got us, boss.
You? You hunk of lard!
You got muscles where you should have brains.
My canary's got more brains than you! Dumb salami.
What's funny?
Don't worry, I've been trying to see him for months.
- You have?
- Of course.
- What do you do?
- I'm the greatest tap dancer.
- You are?
- Of course I are. Cross my heart.
But all he says is come back tomorrow.
How many times can
I come back tomorrow?
Anybody who is anybody...
will soon walk through that door.
At Fat Sam's Grand Slam speakeasy.
Always able to find you a table...
there's room for just one more at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...
speakeasy.
Once you get here, feel the cheer...
like they say in the poem...
Fat Sam ain't humble...
but it's your home sweet home.
Plans are made here...
games are played here...
I could write a book.
Each night astounds you, rumors are buzzin'...
stories by the dozen.
Look around you, cousin...
at the news we're making here.
Anybody who is anybody will soon walk through the door...
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...
speakeasy.
There's a politician sitting by the kitchen...
said he caught his fingers in the one he was wishin'.
Once you get here, feel the cheer...

Anybody who is anybody will soon walk through the door...
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...
speakeasy.
You know something?
You look like you put your face on backwards this morning.
- You got too much mouth.
- I'll tell my dentist.
- Watch where you're going.
- Sorry. It's your fault.
What's that, a hockey stick?
No, a baseball bat.
You're a baseball player?
No, a dancer. My mother made me pack it.
- You a sports nut?
- It's for protection.
- You take it everywhere?
- No, I came about a job.
- You get it?
- They said come back tomorrow.
- What's your name?
- Brown.
Sounds like a loaf of bread.
Blousey Brown.
Blousey Brown?
A stale loaf of bread.
Very funny. Terrific.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bugsy Malone.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
It's okay, everybody.
Just a little excitement.
Razzmatazz, music. I wanna see everyone enjoying themselves.
Can't say Fat Sam's place ain't the liveliest joint in town.
Knuckles, this means trouble.
- You know what to do?
- Sure, boss.
Step on it, Jackson.
What is this?
Irving.
Get me out of here.
- Located the gun yet?
- I can't answer that.
- Not at liberty to say?
- No. I don't know the answer.
Where do the guns come from?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Ask Captain Smolsky.
O'Dreary, break up the crowd.
- Have you found the gun?
- No comment.
- And the source of the guns?
- No comment.
Is it true that only one gang uses the gun?
No comment.
Can I give you a lift?
- You got a car?
- No.
How you gonna give me a lift? Stand me on a box?
- We could share a taxi.
- Forget it. I don't share fares.
I'm a lady.
Furthermore, I'm broke.
- Who said share fares?
- No?
No. I wouldn't dream of it.
- You wouldn't?
- I thought you'd pay.
Swell.
Let's walk.
It's a nice night.
You shouldn't walk at night. It's dangerous.
We'll be okay. We got your baseball bat.
Quit the "we" bit.
You mean, I'll be okay.
- Which way you going?
- Which way you going?
- This way.
- Then I'm going this way.
Let me take that.
No, it's all right.
Look, beat it, will you?
- What have you got in here?
- Just a few books.
Few books? You should start a library.
You should shut your mouth.
- Have you eaten?
- Ever since I was a kid.
- How come you're so skinny?
- Because I watch my weight.
I do that when I'm broke, too. How about eating now?
No.
- Why not?
- I'm not hungry.
- Not hungry?
- No.
I'm starving.
That's more like it.
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Take it easy.
Don't do that, Knuckles.
It's how I got my name.
Knock it off or change your name.
Tallulah, how long we got to wait?
Coming. You don't want me looking a mess, do you?
Snap it up, will you?
Put your flaps down, or you'll take off.
You spend more time prettying yourself than anyone.
If I didn't look this good, you wouldn't look at me.
I'll see you in the car.
What about my audition?
Tomorrow, Fizzy. I'm tired.
Lots of important business.
I have to go home.
I promise you, tomorrow.
Goodbye. Goodnight.
- You coming, Velma?
- Sure.
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight, Miss Tallulah.
Oh, my purse.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes.
What kind of a fool do they take me for?
Tomorrow.
A resting place for bums...
a trap set in the slums, but I know the score.
I won't take no for an answer...
I was born to be a dancer...
tomorrow...
tomorrow, as they say...
another working day...
and another chore.
Tomorrow...
an awful...
place to be.
I gave up yesterday, but they still want more.
They'll compare me...
to Fred Astaire...
when I'm done.
Yeah.
Anyone who feels the rhythm moving through him...
knows it's gonna do him good to let the music burst out...
when you feel it, show it, let the people know it...
let your laughter loose till your scream becomes a a love shout...
tomorrow...
tomorrow's far away...
tomorrow, as they say...
is reserved for dreams.
Tomorrow...
tomorrow's looking grey...
a playground always locked trains no winning teams.
Won't take no for an answer...
I was born to be a dancer...
now.
Anyone who feels the rhythm moving through him...
knows it's gonna do him good...
to let the music...
burst out.
When you feel it, show it, let the people know it...
let your laughter loose...
till your scream becomes a love shout.
Going to the speakeasy tomorrow?
Depends. I'm trying my luck at the Bijoux Theatre.
Lena Marelli's show?
She walked out. They're changing everything.
How long have you wanted to be a singer?
I don't want to be just a singer, I wanna be a movie star... in Hollywood.
What's so funny?
I don't know.
Time was when people were happy being railway engineers... or nurses.
Don't you want to be anybody?
No. I'm happy being me.
What do you do?
Oh, this and that.
- Crooked, huh?
- No, in-between.
What do you do for money?
- I find boxers.
- You do?
I used to fight myself.
You did? How good were you?
- I could've been a contender.
- You could?
Sure, but for a few things.
- Like what?
- Like a glass jaw.
Jelly legs, no stamina.
- And most of all...
- What?
I got scared.
Some contender.
- Want another drink?
- No, I had enough.
Come on.
- Thought you didn't have money?
- I haven't.
- Then how you...?
- Relax.
I'll think of something.
Two more drinks.
Look, pal, the food counter's closed. the bar's closed.
My eyes are closing.
The whole joint’s closed.
I didn't want one, anyway.
Hello.
Operator, could you test this line? I believe we have a fault.
- What number, please?
- Columbus 19785.
- I'll call you right back.
- Thank you.
How much I owe you?
Eight banana boozle specials, with double ice cream.
Three beef spitfires... two cream donuts and a salami special.
Four dollars and 80 cents.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Let me out!
What are you doing? Let me out!
We interrupt commentary of tonight's ball game...
to bring you a bulletin on gang warfare.
Police now officially state...
that the new weapon of foreign manufacture...
known as the splurge gun is being widely used...
by mobster gangs.
We now go back to...
our reporter, Seymour Scoop.
What's more, it's just not cricket.
There's a Mr. Bronx
Charlie to see you.
I'll be right in. Show them into the conservatory.
Very good, sir.
Aren't you gonna play no more?
Later, my rose. Later.
Velia, oh Velia...
the witch of the wood...
would I not die for you if I could.
Velia, oh Velia...
- Next!
- Very nice.
Lovely. Next.
Get off the stage!
Don't give up your day job.
I didn't figure on this many people.
They all look like jugglers and magicians.
Don't worry. You got no competition. You'll walk it.
Hurry up.
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm proud to be here.
In fact, I'm lucky to be here.
Because as I was coming here...
- How do I look?
- Fine.
- I look terrible.
- Believe me, you look swell.
- Honest?
- Honest.
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart. Beautiful.
Next.
Once I built a railroad...
Not that old chestnut.
Get him off. Next.
Good evening.
Suppose you're wondering why we're here.
You bet.
Next.
Not one rabbit... not two rabbits... but three rabbits.
Next, next.
Next.
Yeah, great. Okay.
Next one there, please.
Give me your things.
Come on, come on.
Blousey Brown, singer.
Oh, nice face.
Great face, could do a lot with that.
Oscar.
Oscar.
Oscar.
I'm back. I'll give you one more chance.
Lena, you've come back to me.
I'll give you one more chance.
Otherwise, I'm out for good. Out, out, out!
I won't be humiliated.
I'm the star and I should be treated like one.
Hit it, Joe.
Show business, it's in my veins...
gotta keep singing that old refrain...
I thrill to all those tunes that make me wanna dance...
Cheer up. There's a million other jobs.
Sure, standing on the corner asking for dimes.
It's only a matter of time.
I've walked the streets for months, and the only fancy steps...
I've been doing is avoiding the rent collector.
Takes time to be a movie star.
We could come back tomorrow.
Come back tomorrow? I spend my whole life doing that.
Knock it off. Cool down.
I will not cool down.
Don't be stupid.
Will you be quiet up there?
I'm rehearsing.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
There's always Fat Sam's place.
- He won't see me.
- I'll talk to him.
- You know him?
- Know him? We're like that.
You're good friends?
No, but when I see him I cross my fingers that he won't hit me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
You're too good for this show.
- Why don't we try Fat Sam's?
- Yeah.
You gotta be kidding...
that show business is my business...
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, boss.
Relax, relax, will you?
I'd like to take the opportunity to thank you for your work.
Everything's gone so well.
Thanks, boss.
Thanks, boss.
Fat Sam must've had quite a shock.
- Quite a shock.
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks.
Thanks, boss.
Laughing boy.
Yonkers. Shoulders.
Bronx Charlie. Benny Lee.
Any moment now Fat Sam will be... crawling on his knees to me.
On his knees.
- Where's my flower, boss?
- Yes... soon all Fat Sam will have is the suit he stands up in... and a suitcase full of memories.
I don't have a flower, boss.
What did I do?
You googed, Doodle.
You dropped the gun.
And I don't allow mistakes.
'Cause they put us in the caboose.
- And Sing Sing ain't my style.
- No, boss.
Not that. Anything but that.
I didn't mean to drop it.
It slipped outta my hands.
Button your lip.
You're all washed up.
- Give a guy a break.
- Get him!
Now listen to what I say, and listen good.
There's only room for one
Mr. Big in this town.
And that's me, Dandy Dan.
The time has come for us to play our next card.
Believe me, Fat Sam and his dumb bums... ain't gonna stand in our way.
We could've been anything...
that we wanted to be.
But don't it make your heart glad...
that we take pride in it...
we became the best at being bad.
We could've been anything we wanted to be...
with all the talent we had.
No doubt about it, we whine and we pout it...
we're the very best at being...
bad guys.
We're rotten to the core...
congratulations, no one likes you anymore...
bad guys...
we're the very worst.
Each of us contemptible...
we're criticized and cursed...
we've made the big-time...
malicious and mad...
we're the very best at being bad.
Look at me, I'm dancin'.
We could've been anything we wanted to be...
we took the easy way out...
with a little training, we've mastered complaining...
made us seem unnecessary...
we're so rude, it's scary...
We could've been anything we wanted to be...
with all the talent we had...
with a little practice
we made every black list...
we're the very best...
at being bad...
we're the very best...
at being bad.
Where you shovin' me?
We're the very best at being bad.
What are you doing?
Get in here, you bunch of peanut brains.
Get in here, you dummies.
We got business to do. Move it!
Come on, get in here.
We got business to do.
We can't waste all this time.
Right.
Let's get down to it.
Don't do that, Snake Eyes.
It's thinking time.
And don't do that, Knuckles.
Sure thing, boss.
Let's start at the beginning.
We're being outsmarted by that lounge lizard.
And we're gonna get back on top.
Back on top.
We'll kick that drugstore cowboy...
- into line.
- You bet, boss.
We've been a little slow off the mark, but dumb bums we ain't.
No, dumb bums we ain't.
Hand me a pie.
- Louie, over there in the corner.
- Me, boss?
Why me?
Louie, into the corner.
What did I do?
Nothing, Louie.
You see? Missed.
Okay, Lou. You can sit down.
Even a dumb bum like
Louie is too quick for us.
That's our trouble.
We're behind the times.
I don't get it.
We'll never get back on top with this kind of hardware.
It's old-fashioned.
In short, we gotta get that gun.
- Hello.
- Want some information?
- Start gabbin'...
- It's about the splurge gun.
It's at the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company.
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
We've had a little break.
Who knows the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company?
My friend tells me that's where they stash the guns.
Get moving!
Not you, Knuckles.
Stay here with me.
Sure, boss.
Hello. What?
I don't believe it.
The whole gang?
Everybody?
That leaves you and me. We're on our own.
What we gonna do?
Don't do that! How many times I got to tell you?
Do nothing. Act like everything was normal.
- What does that mean?
- You can't speak Italian?
No, boss, I'm Jewish.
Then read the translation!
- Hey, Fizzy.
- Hey, Bugsy.
- Still practicing?
- Still practicing.
Suddenly everybody wants to be in show business.
Hi. Tallulah. I've come to see Fat Sam.
- Is he in?
- No, he's busy.
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Hi.
Have a drink while you wait.
Yeah, why not?
Go feed the ducks, will you?
Oh, Tallulah.
I said, beat it.
Long time no see.
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.
You used to come see me every night.
- I've been busy.
- Busy doing what?
This and that.
Fizzy, cut the ivory and hit the shoe leather.
Yes, ma'am.
You're aces, Bugsy.
I always found you special.
Careful, you're racing my mother.
Come on, give a girl a break.
Sure you've got the right fella?
- You're not like those other saps.
- No?
No.
You've got lovely brown eyes.
They'll be black eyes if Fat Sam catches us.
- How about smearing my lipstick?
- Careful.
If you come any closer,
I'll have to call my lawyer.
So call him.
Blousey.
Blousey.
Blousey.
It's the broad about the audition.
He's busy. Come back tomorrow.
No, no, no.
Hey, honey. I'm all ears.
Be with you in a minute.
Carry on as normal.
Don't let 'em know we're beat.
- Business as usual.
- Right.
- Calm and collected.
- Right.
So they don't know we're scared. I mean, concerned.
Sure, boss.
I'm feeling fine...
filled with emotions...
stronger than wine...
they give me the notion...
that this strange new feeling...
is something that you're feeling too.
Matter of fact...
I'm forced to admit it...
caught in the act...
and maybe we've hit it...
this strange new feeling...
is something you're feeling...
Okay, honey. That's enough.
A little contemporary for me, but very nice. You're hired.
That was great. That really was. Terrific.
Blousey.
Come back, will you?
What's the use?
I've got to go.
Blousey.
Where is she? Blousey.
Show's going swell.
Just the way I want it to be.
Same number of drinks, same everything.
They mustn't know they've got us on the run.
Here, I wanna show you something.
I've sent for someone to help us out of our predicament.
No ten-cent dummy. A specialist.
A doctor?
Not a doctor, a hoodlum.
I thought we were hoodlums.
Not a dumb bum. This guy is the real McCoy.
Not Looney Bergonzi!
The Looney Bergonzi?
The very same, mad as a hatter, Bergonzi.
Best man in Chicago.
Here's what we do.
We meet Dandy Dan.
Looney hides in the back seat.
- You drive.
- Right.
- But I don't drive.
- You what?
You don't drive?
Then we get ourselves a driver.
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Is Blousey there?
- She won't see you.
- Tell her I'm sick.
- You're sick?
- Sick of waiting.
Beat it.
Give a guy a break.
I brought you some flowers.
I'll see Tallulah gets them.
Quit being smart. They're for you.
Five minutes, girls.
- I have to go.
- I was thinking of getting a job.
You don't get paid for standing in bread lines.
A legit job. We could save enough money to go to Hollywood.
Believe it when I see it.
- Bugsy, you drive?
- Sure, why?
- Like to earn some green stuff?
- Long as it ain't cabbages.
Step inside. I got a proposition for you.
Flowers? For me?
How nice.
Put these in water.
Hello?
Who shall I say is calling? One moment.
- Hello.
- Dandy Dan, is that you?
- This is Dandy Dan speaking.
- I wanna arrange a meeting.
- Sure. Where?
- Outta town.
Agreed. Just you and a driver.
- When?
- Monday. 11 A.M..
Right, I'll be there.
Got him, the knuckle.
Got him, the salami.
Let's go and enjoy the show.
My name is Tallulah...
my first rule of thumb...
I don't say where I'm going, or where I'm coming from.
I try to leave a little reputation behind me...
so if you really need to, you'll know how to find me.
My name is Tallulah...
I live till I die...
I'll take what you give me...
and I won't ask why.
I've made a lot of friends in exotic places...
I don't remember names...
but I remember faces.
Lonely, you don't have to be lonely...
come see Tallulah, we can chase your troubles away.
If you're lonely...
you don't have to be lonely.
When they talk to Tallulah, you know what they say...
no one south of heaven's gonna treat you finer...
Tallulah had her training in North Carolina.
My name is Tallulah...
and soon I'll be gone...
an open invitation is the road I travel on.
I never say goodbye because the words upset me.
You may forgive my going...
but you won't forget me.
Lonely...
you don't have to be lonely...
come see Tallulah, we can chase your troubles away.
If you're lonely...
you don't have to be lonely...
when they talk about Tallulah, you know what they say...
no one south of heaven's gonna treat you finer...
Tallulah had her training in North Carolina.
They're coming.
Looney, keep your head down.
What can I do for you?
How about some straight talk?
Suits me.
- You've been taking liberties.
- I've been taking what's mine.
- Trouble is, it belongs to me.
- Too bad.
I'm sure we can talk it over. I'm a businessman.
Yeah, a dime-a-dozen gangster.
Button your lip.
Don't talk dirty to me.
I don't like your mouth. Have some respect.
You'd slit your own throat for two bits.
Keep your wisecracks.
Keep talking.
I have my position to think of.
Right now it's not worth a nickel.
You're a dirty rat, Dan.
You've been watching too many movies.
Okay, Looney, let him have it.
Charlie, Yonkers, it's a double-cross.
Okay, freeze.
Looney.
What's the matter with you?
Hey, you guys.
Over here!
Over here!
Come back, dummies!
They're getting away.
Come back here.
Come on, step on it.
Come on, let's go.
We're going to lose them.
Drive faster.
Dan, you're a rat!
You're a dirty rat!
Come on, they're gonna get us.
Hold tight, Mr. Stacetto.
Come on, Malone.
You're a dirty double-crossing rat!
Look out.
Don't stop!
There's a bridge!
Put the brakes on!
We lost them.
Go and cluck somewhere else.
Here. Get yourself a new suit.
Get rid of the sack you're wearing.
Thank you, Mr. Stacetto.
Here's my tailor's card.
You ain't got to pay for six months.
Thank you very much.
Think nothing of it. Let's go.
What do you think?
Don't I look cute?
I don't know.
Come on, Dotty, what do you think?
I think the color's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Purple's my color.
Don't I always wear purple?
It matches your nose.
Maybe it's the length.
It's the latest length. Look!
Maybe the frills stick out too much. Like your ears.
Frills are in. Look at this photo of Lena Marelli.
Lena Marelli is not Bangles Dobell.
You think it'd look better on you?
It'd look better on a horse.
Jealous. Can I help it if my looks are ahead of their time?
What?
Full of character.
Kind of earthy.
Like a bucket of mud.
You creep. Get lost!
How about you? Do you think I look terrible?
Do I look cute or terrible?
Honestly?
Bangles Dobell, you look terrible.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Blousey.
Blousey.
Blousey.
It's for you. It's Bugsy.
Give him my love.
Thanks.
Hello.
Blousey, it's Bugsy.
Where are you?
Around. I can't talk, but I just made 200 bucks.
You printed it yourself?
No, I earned it.
Doing what?
Oh, this and that.
Hang on a minute.
I can't hear you.
There's a train going by.
Who gave you the money?
Fat Sam.
He gave you 200 dollars?
And the loan of his sedan for the afternoon.
He loaned you his sedan?
I don't believe it.
You're putting me on.
I believe you.
He's a sinner...
candy-coated...
he always seems to be alone...
but they love him,
Bugsy Malone.
A city slicker...
he can charm you with a smile...
a style all his own...
everybody loves that man...
Bugsy Malone.
Hard-headed Bugsy...
makes his mind up...
don't mess with Bugsy, or you'll wind up...
wishing you'd left him alone.
He's a man, a mountain, he's a rolling stone...
and when he leaves you...
sad and lonely...
cry, I couldn't say.
But it's known...
that everybody wants that man...
Bugsy Malone.
Mustard with onions or ketchup?
Mustard with onions.
Oh, and this, too.
- What's this?
- A present.
- Open it up.
- You got to be kidding.
I don't kid around.
It's beautiful.
Nice, huh?
What is it?
What is it? A viewer.
Look through here.
Pictures of Hollywood stars.
Bugsy... it's fantastic. It really is.
If only I could get to Hollywood.
You can.
Sure.
I know, in the front row... of the Roxy Theatre... on East 38th Street.
No, really get to Hollywood.
Keep talking.
1.80 for the viewer, right?
10 cents for the hot dogs.
Leaves 198 dollars for...
Surprise me.
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets?
How many tickets you need?
Two tickets to the ball game?
To Hollywood, dummy.
This can't be true.
Are we really going?
Knock it off.
You're putting me on.
It's the honest truth.
I'm picking them up tomorrow.
Now I better get
Fat Sam's car back.
Or I'm not going anywhere.
Is anyone in there?
Hello?
Are you hurt?
Help! Somebody help me, please!
Somebody, please!
Somebody help!
Help me, please!
They take your money?
Yeah. Nearly 200 dollars.
Thanks anyway for helping me.
It was nothing.
- You must be a boxer, right?
- No.
- You're not?
- No.
Best punching I ever saw.
- Ever been coached?
- No.
- Ever thought of taking it up?
- No.
Why not? You could be a champion.
- Never had the chance.
- I know who could help you.
- You know Cagey Joe?
- No.
- You must know Slugger's Gym?
- No.
- You don't know much, do you?
- Nope.
What's your name?
Smith, Leroy Smith.
I'm Bugsy Malone. Put it there.
You got yourself a manager.
- Know the first thing I'm gonna do?
- No.
Treat you to one heck of a meal.
- Thought they took all your dough.
- Who needs money?
Look at this, O'Dreary.
You cracked it this time, Captain.
Get the plaster.
We'll take a mold.
Come on, get the plaster.
Careful. Up a bit.
Left a bit.
Come on, hurry up.
Hold it straight. Be careful.
You idiots!
Hello. What?
They got the still.
The whole lot's gone.
Not the sarsaparilla racket, too. Get round here now.
- I can't, boss.
- Why not?
I'm all tied up.
I don't care if you're busy. Get here right away.
Careful, you idiots.
O'Dreary.
Don't worry... we'll break you out at headquarters.
- Hi, Bugsy. How you been?
- Swell, Cagey Joe.
I'd like you to meet the next heavyweight champion.
Leroy, meet Cagey Joe.
Cagey Joe, this is Leroy Smith.
- Ever been in the ring before?
- No.
- So you wanna be a fighter?
- No.
Sure he does. He's a natural.
Look at those fists.
Did you ever see such fists?
Hit it, Leroy.
You see? A born champion.
What's your name again?
Smith. Leroy Smith.
With your help... he could be champion in no time.
So you wanna be a boxer...
in the golden ring.
Can you punch like a train?
Tell me just one thing...
can you move like a hummingbird's wing?
Oh, that's fast!
Can you bob, can you weave?
Well, you might as well quit...
if you haven't got it.
So you wanna be a boxer, can you pass the test?
I can tell if you got it,
I've trained the best.
When you work and sweat like a buzz saw...
and you near lose your mind...
when you find out your boy has a glass jaw.
So you might as well quit...
if you haven't got it.
Put him in the ring, look at what you've found...
we can use the fun...
pushing him around.
We'll show him the ropes...
and destroy his hopes...
put him in the ring...
let him feel the sting...
we can make him dance...
we'll pound him to bits...
then he'll call it quits.
Come on, Leroy.
So you wanna be a boxer, wanna be the champ...
there's a golden boy inside you, not a punchy tramp...
if you listen and you learn, there's an honor you can earn...
when you see the crown, you're a king, not a clown.
But you might as well quit...
if you haven't got it.
Put him in the ring, something new to punch...
let me have a swing...
then we'll go to lunch...
then he'll get the drift.
Put him in the ring, chicken à la carte...
let me have a wing, tearing him apart.
The chicken will crow...
let me have him, Joe.
He's got it.
You sure this is going to work?
Sure. Looks like a splurge gun.
Doesn't it?
- Sort of.
- Nonsense.
Anything Dandy Dan can do, I can do better.
Are you ready?
Ready.
Don't do that!
Sorry, boss.
All right, take aim.
Ready.
Get set.
Fire.
Missed!
Back to the drawing board.
Knuckles!
Knuckles, speak to me.
Knuckles.
It's all your fault, hear me?
Hello?
Not the grocery racket, too?
Yeah.
That's the whole empire gone. Hear me? Everything.
They'll be coming here next.
There's only one thing for it.
You have to get him to help me.
Who? The Lone Ranger?
No, Bugsy Malone. Call him.
I'm in trouble, and all I got for company is a female comedienne.
I'm in trouble, bad trouble.
Is he there?
No. There's no answer.
Then get him to me poysanally.
Personally?
- Poysanally.
- Poysanally.
So long, lover boy.
I like men at my feet.
What you doing here?
I brought you a message.
What's wrong with Western Union?
Thought you'd like the company.
I'll buy you a drink.
Where?
How about Fat Sam's?
Won't he be there?
He sure will.
Maybe I'll stay home.
Don't flatter yourself... it's him that wants to see you.
Come on.
Before your suspenders strangle you.
Quit whistling, it makes me edgy.
Yes, boss.
- Pour me a double on the rocks.
- Sure, boss.
What's funny? You find me amusing?
I wasn't smiling at you.
Honest, I wasn't.
You find my suit funny?
No, boss.
It was your flower.
Yeah, it is kinda droopy.
Yeah, a little.
In fact, it's very droopy.
Very droopy, boss.
Hold it a minute.
It needs some water.
Don't ever laugh at me again... or I'll ram that smile down your throat.
I'm Fat Sam, don't forget that. Number one man, Mr. Big.
Always have been, always will be. Now get out.
Careful, the floor is wet.
Hi, honey.
Here he is.
Hey, Bugsy.
How you doing, Sam?
Glad to see you.
Pull up a chair.
Fix him a drink.
A special on the rocks.
What can I do for you?
Bugsy...
I'm in a jam.
Dandy Dan's gonna take over my organization.
You still got this.
If Dan gets his way,
I won't have a dime.
Can you leave us alone?
This is men's talk.
That's all right,
I'm unshockable.
Go fix your make-up.
I've already fixed it.
Then go make yourself look more beautiful.
You know that's impossible.
Anything's possible.
I'll go and manicure my gloves.
Bugsy, believe me... my gang's gone. My business is in ruins.
My friends don't wanna know me.
I'm a wreck.
In short, I need your help.
Why me?
'Cause you've got brains, not pretzels.
No, it's not my line.
400 dollars.
Do we have a deal?
Hello?
Bugsy, it's for you.
I think it's Blousey.
You got a deal.
Hold on, he won't be a second.
See you, Bugsy.
Hello, Blousey.
What are you doing there?
Just business.
With Tallulah?
No, with Fat Sam.
Did you get the tickets?
No, you see...
You promised me.
I know.
But Hollywood can wait, can't it?
You had no intention of taking me to Hollywood!
I do! But there's something
I've got to do first.
You promised me.
Trust me. I can't talk now. I'll call you.
Only a fool...
like fools before me...
I always think with my heart.
Only a fool...
that same old story...
seems I was born for the part.
It's a lesson that I've learned...
and a page I should have turned.
I shouldn't cry, but I do.
Like an ordinary fool...
when her ordinary dreams fall through.
How many times have I mistaken...
What can you see?
How many times have I mistaken...
love songs and laughs for the blues.
When a road I've walked before...
ends alone at my door...
I shouldn't cry, but I do...
when my ordinary dreams fall through.
- Splurge guns!
- Where?
In the crates. Look what it says on the truck.
I can't.
Can't you read?
Sure. But I'm short- sighted. What's it say?
It says: Splurge
Imports Incorporated.
Dock 17, East River.
- Must be where the guns are.
- Right.
Look out!
It's a lesson that I've learned...
and a page I should have turned...
I shouldn't cry but I do...
like an ordinary fool...
when her ordinary dreams fall through.
Blousey, miss your train?
What have I done?
Bugsy let you down?
The broad needs her head testing.
You better believe it.
Oh, yeah.
Can I have my job back?
Sure, the more the merrier. Go right in.
Hi, Blousey.
Hi, Blousey.
Ever see a broad carry a torch so high?
Yeah, the Statue of Liberty.
This must be the place.
Two guards on the door.
Two on the roof.
Two on the pier.
- What we gonna do?
- Go home?
There must be a way in.
Don't be stupid. We'll never get... past them.
You're right. Let's go.
What we gonna do, Leroy?
We need more men.
We need an army.
No armies around here.
Yeah, I know.
Hang on a minute.
Don't complain about the way your life has wound up...
think of all the time you waste, and time's a precious thing...
sure you've hit the bottom, but remember you're building up...
every day's another step that takes you closer to the sky...
so give it a try.
Don't be depressed about the way luck deceived you...
fortune sailed away, you missed the boat...
and found you'd been left behind.
What's the matter with you?
Fight and fight some more, till the world receives you...
Lady Luck is fickle, but a lady can change her mind.
Come on, guys, who's with me?
No!
What's the matter with you?
All right, here's somebody.
Me too.
What about the rest of you?
And you?
Why not?
Come on.
Don't sit around complaining...
about how your life's wound up...
be a man, you can't be certain you'll lose till you try.
Don't sit around complaining about how your life's wound up...
you can't be certain you'll lose...
till you try.
So give it a try.
- Is everybody with me?
- Yeah!
Come on.
There they are.
This is what we'll do.
Get Baby Face.
Get Baby Face.
Get Baby Face.
I'm Baby Face. What am I saying?
I gotta have courage.
Give this to Baby Face.
Big courage.
Give it to Baby Face.
Thanks. Just what I need.
Okay, you know what to do.
I'm scared.
Will you get out there!
Yeah, right, get out there.
I'm a big movie star now.
Geronimo!
Get that guy.
Dummies.
Come back here.
Come on, open the boxes.
My name is Tallulah, my first rule of thumb...
Stop fooling around.
Sorry, Bugsy.
I don't have to tell you how important this is.
This is gonna take the lid off City Hall.
- This is the big one.
- The big one.
The shake-down.
The shake-down.
The pay-off.
The pay off.
It's got to be good.
It's got to be good, it's got to be neat...
Quit repeating everything!
You shouldn't have any trouble.
Just Fat Sam and a few dance hall girls.
Good luck and off we go.
Three cheers for Dandy Dan.
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
Too kind, guys.
Jelly, Jelly, open up!
They're here!
Just act normal.
Get to work.
Girls, off you go.
Razzmatazz, let's hear some music.
Okay, this is our moment.
Keep a cool head and keep those fingers pumping.
Remember, you'll be writing history.
Fat Sam ain't humble...
but it's your home sweet home...
plans are made here...
Okay, everybody, freeze.
Let them have it.
Amazing scenes... have been reported on the lower East side.
It's been a frightful bad show.
So, this is show business?
We could've been anything we wanted...
and it's not too late to change...
I'd be delighted...
to give it some thought...
maybe you'll agree that we really ought...
We could've been anything we wanted...
that decision is ours...
it's been decided, we're weaker divided...
let friendship double our powers.
We could've been anything we wanted...
and I'm not saying we should...
but if we tried it...
we could be the best...
at being good guys.
Flowers of the earth...
who can guess how much...
a real friend is worth.
Good guys...
shake an open hand...
maybe we'll be trusting...
if we try to understand.
No doubt about it...
it must be worthwhile...
friends tend to make you smile.
We could've been anything...
that we wanted to be.
That decision is ours.
It's been decided...
we're weaker divided...
let friendship double our powers.
You give a little love and it all comes back to you.
You know you'll be remembered for the things you say and do.
You give a little love and it all comes back to you.
You'll be remembered for the things you say and do.
You give a little love and it all comes back to you.
You'll be remembered for the things you say and do.
You give a little love...
and it all comes back to you.
Million Dollar Duck
Albert Dooley, the student voted most likely to succeed of the class of 1959.
You lovely big success,
Albert.
Daddy?
Daddy!
Excuse me.
Yeah, what is it, son?
Here's a puppy
Eddie said he'd give me.
- He's a cute one.
- For only 50 dollars.
Fifty dollars?
He has his own pedigree.
That price he oughta have his own car.
I already picked out a name for him... Charlie.
Good, hah?
Yeah, that's fine, but that's...
I mean, 50 dollars, you know, it's...
Well, there are licences and vets and shots and...
Think of all the food!
I'd share my food with him.
No, Jimmy. Small boys need all the nourishment they can get.
You're not a small boy.
You could share your food.
Maybe next year, okay, Jim?
I'll get a job. Rent my room, I'll sleep in the garage with Charlie.
Please, daddy.
I'm sorry, Jim.
I thought you and I were pals.
We are pals, pal, but...
Where am I gonna get 50 bucks?
I can't even pay these bills.
Here, Eddie.
Take him.
Bye, Charlie.
Jimmy!
Pal?
Cinnamon.
A bit of cinnamon.
Where's the cinnamon?
I just...
Now, it's cinnamon.
Mustard.
Mustard.
Curry powder.
And, Garlic.
Garlic?
There must be a simpler way to make apple sauce.
- Katie!
- Yes, dear?
That was Herman and the Purple Cows.
We have to have another talk about economising.
First guess what I'm cooking.
Three guesses.
- Later, okay?
- Try, plum pudding.
- Plum pudding.
- Wrong.
Try apple sauce.
Katie, we have to economise.
That's what I'm doing.
I'm making home-made apple sauce with apples off our tree.
- That's fine.
- Taste it.
Tell me if you think it's too...
..too ingredient.
That's good.
It's really...
It's really good.
You think you should've peeled the apples first?
Oh, no, see, that's where all your vitamins are.
And the seeds too?
Albert, you should know.
You're the scientist.
Katie...
Now, there must be someplace... that we can cut down.
- This bill from the dress shop...
- I know where we can cut down.
- Where?
- Your lunch money.
What?
Albert, it makes no sense spending money, when you have a wife who could pack you a nice lunch.
Darling, that's too much bother for you to go to every morning.
- To get up...
- Oh, pooh. What is a wife for?
It's just a part of our marriage vows.
To love and obey, till death do us in.
Thank you, darling.
Don't tip your lunch.
The apple sauce is on top.
Bye, sweetie.
Daddy, Eddie says this is my last chance.
- Your last chance for what, pal?
- For Charlie.
- Who?
- The puppy.
Don't bother your father with that now.
He's got little enough on his mind as it is.
Mr. Hooper next door, he has a dog.
He can afford to feed it.
It's a big one.
Mr. Hooper works for the US Treasury, and they have our money.
He could afford a giraffe.
- Finley!
- Giraffe!
Bye, pal.
Oh, dear!
I wish this fool professor made enough money so I could investigate him.
Mornin', Fred.
- Why not drop a bomb on us, Arvin?
- It'd be quicker.
Don't blame us. It was you old cats who invented the internal combustion engine.
Peace.
You're a lawyer.
Do something about those Wadlow boys.
- Something legal, preferably.
- Did you say legal or lethal?
Either way, I'll take the case.
I'll take any case.
- I need some rent money.
- You too?
Sometimes I wish I'd been born rich instead of brilliant.
Mornin'.
Morning, group.
Velma.
Are you awake and ready?
Arnold, wake up.
You two behave yourselves today.
Clyde.
You ready for a big day?
Very good.
Mr. Duck.
Are you gonna shape up today?
For me?
Please?
Good.
If you flunk any more of those tests, you're gonna be a gone goose.
Another dropout performance like yesterday, you'll have Dr. Gottlieb climbing the walls.
He takes a dim view of any duck... that doesn't know a yellow button from a red one.
Be quiet.
What's the matter?
Good. You're eating the apple sauce.
You like it?
I knew you were weird, but that's ridiculous.
You must have got your share too?
- I'll get you a bicarb of soda.
- Dooley!
- Professor Dooley.
- Dr. Gottlieb.
- What are you doing?
- I'm ready.
You realise how far back you're putting the schedule?
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with the chimp?
He's nervous.
- Nervous?
- About the tests.
Well, get on with it.
- No duck!
- What?
- No duck.
- But the schedule calls...
- Revise it.
- Sir, I feel if we test him...
Do you know what the data is on the learning potential test for that...
- Minus eleven.
- It might be a slow learner.
- Slow?
- Yes, sir.
This duck could shed new light on the rates of learning for various animals.
All right.
But it's his last chance!
Thank you, sir.
Last!
I understand.
You hear that?
You gotta shape up...
You got apple sauce all over your face. Come here.
Took him ten seconds last time.
Let's see if he'll do better.
Excellent.
Well, Mr. Pig, what are you gonna show us today?
Beautiful!
Superb.
No, Dooley. That duck couldn't begin to handle these tests.
Over here.
This is the simplest device we've got.
The duck had 49 hours of practice on this one, so it's time we see results.
Okay, duck, go for the yellow button, the centre.
He's got it.
Get that stupid duck out of here!
Wait a minute. Just one more time.
Just one more time.
For what? He's useless, completely unresponsive.
All right, fella, once more.
Yellow button, centre.
You don't give up.
- There he goes for the red button again.
- No, he's got it now.
At least he's reacting.
All right, get that misfit out of here.
Dr. Gottlieb, you have to admit that's an interesting reaction.
This duck is a fascinating creature.
What have we got here?
Gamma rays on what?
Testing some new high-resistant silicone oils.
- Phenyl type?
- Yeah.
What is the integrated threshold neutron flux?
- What do you mean by that?
- What?
Well, you said, Quack.
I didn't say quack.
Holy cow!
Professor.
Is this one of your creatures?
- Yes, how did she get in there?
- You tell me.
You almost had fried duck.
Well... is she okay?
Sure, no harm.
Just got a little jolt.
But would you please keep your friends out of our department?
Yeah, okay.
Boy, you really blew it today.
Only thing to do now is find you a home for retired dropouts.
A duck?
Yeah, that's what it is.
A duck.
But I want a puppy.
I don't want a dumb old duck.
I didn't bring it home for a pet.
Then why'd you bring it?
It was that or let the janitor's wife fricassee it.
- It was a washout at the lab.
- Wouldn't a puppy be as cheap to feed?
- We're not gonna keep it.
- He really had his heart set on a puppy.
Katie, now, we've been through all of that.
I'm just trying to find a home for this poor, stupid duck.
Maybe that farmer would take it, the one that sells us those vegetables I can't afford.
- You mean Mr. Gilby?
- Yeah, I guess so.
You're mixed up.
Mr. Gilby is the bakery truck man.
- Mr. Purdham is the vegetable man.
- Well, Purdham. Okay.
Give it to him.
It'll have a good home on his farm.
- Probably eat better than we do.
- Hey, daddy!
I think he likes me.
Watch how he follows me.
Come on.
How would you like a real great name?
You like that?
Maybe I can teach him some tricks.
Him? Good luck.
Albert!
I was just thinking.
Good for you.
Yeah, instead of giving that duck to Mr. Purdham, maybe Jimmy could trade it in on a puppy.
- We settled all that.
- I know.
But it wouldn't cost you anything, and it might help...
Never mind.
I shouldn't even mention it.
- Mention what?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm sure you'll solve it.
OK, Katie solve what?
The generation gap you're creating between Jimmy over this puppy.
Katie.
Come on, Katie.
Honey, you know Jimmy and I have a very good, close relationship.
Of course you do, Albert.
That's why I didn't even mention it.
Daddy, daddy!
Help!
Help!
Daddy, help!
- He's gonna kill Charlie!
- What?
Get outta here!
- Leave that duck alone.
- Get out of my yard!
- That's our duck.
- Well, get him out of my pool.
Get your hands off my skimmer!
- Charlie!
- Jimmy, be careful.
I got you now, you duck-billed intruder!
Get your hands off of my skimmer.
Attaboy, Charlie!
Get that bird off my slide!
- Stop that dog!
- Go, Charlie!
Bite him in the tail feathers.
Don't let him get away from you.
Come here, duck.
If that dog lays a tooth on that duck...
Take your skimmer...
- Hooper, let go!
- You're gonna drown him!
Come here, duck!
I'll report you to the SPCIA.
Call your dog, Hooper!
Get this duck out of the pool.
He's contaminating it.
Get your dirty shoes out of my pool!
Why, you hit my husband!
Come here, Jimmy.
Take the duck.
Hurry.
Now hold on.
- Climb up the stairs.
- Come on! Albert, hurry.
- Come on!
- Go on!
Hurry before the dog gets out.
Oh, sic 'em!
Go! Give 'em a good one.
Go get 'em, Duke.
Finley!
What are you doing in there with your clothes on?
Can't leave you alone for a minute.
Look, daddy.
Charlie laid an egg!
Why, Charlie, you're a mama!
Twins!
Four eggs.
Isn't that something?
I don't see how she laid any eggs with that beast barking at her.
It was that beast that caused her to do it.
Now, Albert, they hardly know each other.
No, I mean...
I know what you mean. Don't discuss it in front of our S-O-N.
We learned that stuff in school anyway.
No. It's a conditioned reflex, you see?
When the dog barks, the duck lays an egg.
I do not know why.
It happened once at the lab.
That's not the way my mother explained it to me.
Anyway, the important thing is... the money we're gonna save growing our eggs.
We're not eating those eggs.
I mean, this duck, it's strange.
No, it's an aberration, a biological mutation.
It is?
That's a chemically mixed-up duck.
It's even been radiated and...
We're not eating those eggs.
Good. Then we'll hatch 'em.
Is that all right?
Hatching them?
No. They probably wouldn't hatch anyway.
Only thing to do is bury 'em, which I'll do after Jimmy goes to sleep.
Albert?
- What the devil are you doing?
- Nothing.
Digging a hole at midnight in your pyjamas is nothing?
You know,
I'm digging.
- For what?
- Night crawlers.
They certainly lay big eggs.
Go to bed.
You're a nut.
- Dooley?
- Yes, Dr. Gottlieb.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, a research problem.
Come on.
Sit down.
- Well?
- Dr. Gottlieb, is it possible...
In science, anything is possible.
Yes, but could radiation alter the molecular structure of a... substance... from organic to inorganic?
So we're a radiobiologist now, are we, Dooley?
Just a minute.
Yeah.
Try these for starters.
- Actually, all I wanted to know...
- The answer is yes.
- But what substance?
- Like an egg.
- What kind of an egg?
- Doesn't...
Chicken, turkey, duck.
- Please don't mention duck to me.
- Sorry.
Anyway, your experiment has been done.
In 1903.
It was a young medical student at the Royal
Viennese Hospital.
His name was
Schultz or Schmaltz.
Here. Schwartz.
In searching for a chemical background for radiogenic inflammation from radium,
Gottwald Schwartz exposed an egg to becquerel rays.
Both the organic and inorganic molecules suffered a change.
Yes, yes.
There was no change in the white of the egg,
No. but there was conspicuous change in the yolk.
The yolk!
That's it!
I mean, that's... quite interesting.
Didn't... change it into any kind of... metal, did it?
Metal?
What do you want, Dooley, gold?
Well, you said anything was possible.
Possible, yes.
But... making a golden egg?
That's for Aesop's Fables, isn't it?
But gold has been made synthetically, hasn't it?
Yes, with nuclear bombardment, but we know what that costs, don't we?
- It doesn't pay.
- No.
Excuse me.
Dr. Gottlieb.
I'll be right there.
Excuse me.
I have to go recheck the IQ of the chimp.
Hundred and forty.
Higher than mine.
We've run quite a few tests on that metal of yours.
- Yes, and...
- Darndest thing we ever ran across.
- But is it...
- You won't believe this report.
- Well, it's wild.
- Then it's not...
Look here, Dooley. The metal contains traces of D-galacturonic acid.
Now, isn't that wild?
You know what that is.
That's pectin.
Pectin?
Pectin that's been hydrolysed under intense heat.
Pectin comes from apple peelings.
Apple sauce.
No, it's true. And look, it also has a trace of garlic in it.
I don't wanna hear any more.
As long as it's not gold.
What do you mean, is not gold.
It's practically pure gold.
What?
But it has some of the weirdest impurities in it.
There is one element we can't identify, not related to any of the 103 basic known chemical elements.
Mr. Dooley, you didn't get hold of a moon rock, did you?
Moon rock? Me?
No.
I've never even been out of California.
- Where'd you dig up this gold?
- Dig? I didn't dig.
- A placer deposit?
- Yes, it was deposited, you might say.
- Thank you very much.
- Wait a second.
- You want your report? You paid for it.
- Yes.
The report.
Thank you very much.
So this is an assayer's report.
So what?
That's why I need a lawyer, to help me incorporate.
Incorporate what?
Fred, that sample is the yolk of a duck egg.
Come on.
I know how incredible this must sound to your legal mind, but in 1903 a Viennese scientist...
You ever read Aesop's Fables, the one about the goose?
Should you be driving in your condition?
I'm telling you, Fred, that fable may be scientifically feasible.
- Pull over, Albert. I'll drive.
- Okay, sceptic.
I'm gonna show you one of those gold eggs actually being laid.
Watch out!
You crazy, ding-a-ling driver, Orlo!
I'm not even in the car.
That's Arvin. Bigot!
Now, you just lie there and relax, Finley.
Forget all about that nasty, old treasury office.
Thank you, dear.
You're a good person.
Come on, Fred.
I'll get the duck, make Hooper's dog bark at it, and you'll see.
Would you please go upstairs and talk to Jimmy?
Not now. I've got news.
Our financial worries are over.
Jimmy's broken-hearted because I was....
You're not listening. We're gonna be rich beyond our wildest dreams.
Oh, I always knew you'd make good, even when Papa kept saying,
Don't marry that no-good, lazy...
It's nothing I did.
It's Charlie.
Remember those eggs
I was gonna bury?
Brace yourself.
They're gold.
Well, don't look that way.
I'm not kidding you.
- It's true.
- Albert, I believe you.
- What's the matter?
- I gave the duck to Mr. Purdham.
You told me to!
I was sorry I did.
Jimmy's been crying.
Where does Purdham live?
- I'm not sure.
- Think!
I'm trying.
- Where does Purdham live?
- Try the cookie jar.
- The cookie jar.
- Where I keep my addresses.
Oh! We've gotta find that duck... before anything happens to it.
Chicken chow mein.
But I...
Purdham!
Oak Road. Come on!
Get in the car, Fred!
Daddy, wait!
Well, look,
I guess I could... give you five dollars for it.
Well, I... I know I never turn down a good deal.
You'll find the duck in the pen back of the barn yonder.
Thanks.
Hello, Mr. Purdham.
Oh, no!
There's gotta be a million of 'em!
Charlie.
Where are you?
This duck doesn't respond to normal things, like its name.
- You know what we need?
- A good psychiatrist.
No. We need something it does respond to.
Start barking, Fred!
It's our only chance.
Bark!
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?
A sane adult with a law degree crawling around a barnyard, barking at fowls, trying to find a duck who lays solid gold...
Solid gold eggs!
I'll never see Charlie again.
Come on. We're not gonna give up till we're licked.
We'll find him.
Charlie?
Where are you goin'?
They're gettin' away from us!
Come on, Fred!
Get out!
Get back there.
Go back, ducks.
- They're in the pond.
- Head 'em off!
Back, you ducks!
Get back, ducks.
Get them out of the water.
Shove them back onto the shore.
Here.
What's goin' on?
You said only one duck.
But something happened to the gate.
Get these critters back in the pen.
Get back!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Oh, Charlie!
Daddy, daddy!
I found Charlie!
Hey, wait.
Come back!
Help me.
- I knew I'd find her.
- You sure it's her, son?
I know it is.
It's Charlie.
There's one way to find out.
Hold her on the ground, Fred.
Maybe only Hooper's dog can do it.
No reflection on you, dear.
Why, Albert, you don't sound like Hooper's dog at all.
He goes more like...
I think she's got it.
Pitch.
It might be a matter of pitch.
Come on.
Dear, Charlie.
What do you think now, sceptic?
Baby... you're lookin' at a believer.
Figuring its weight in troy ounces, at the pegged gold price, that's over 900 bucks a yolk.
- That's right.
- And if she laid four eggs in...
- How long did you say?
- About ten minutes.
That would be over 20,000 dollars an hour.
And if she worked a six-hour day, give or take a couple of coffee breaks... corn breaks...
Al, baby, we're talkin' about a 100,000 dollars-a-day business!
That's right. If I can find the formula to keep her producing.
Oh, you'll do it.
You'll do it.
The big problem is: How do we legally protect our fortune?
Our fortune?
What do you mean, our fortune?
Look, Al, sweetheart,
I'm only trying to save you money.
By making me a partner, you'll save paying me exorbitant lawyer's fees.
I'll have to devote full-time, incorporating a duck and not have the Internal Revenuers on our neck.
- I got your clothes all nice and dry for you.
- Oh, fine.
How did you manage to do this, Katie?
- It was no trouble, really.
- Thanks.
Anyway, the thing to do is to sit tight until I figure things out.
And don't tell anybody about this, especially...
- Hooper?
- Right.
We don't want that government stool pigeon snooping around.
The first thing I'm gonna do is get rid of that junk I'm driving.
I saw the most fantastic yellow sports car.
Hold it!
Don't spend any of that money yet.
- What?
- No changes in your living standards.
- You mean, not pay our bills?
- Bills, fine.
We can't raise suspicions until we get this legally protected.
Now...
Let's try and get some sleep.
Or... do you think we oughta get the duck and bark out a few more thou?
The duck's asleep with Jimmy, and I don't want Jimmy disturbed.
And, Fred... don't forget to bring my robe back.
- That's not part of the deal.
- Okay... partner.
Albert, do you think now we can afford to reshingle our house?
Reshingle our house?
We could reshingle the Pentagon.
We could buy the Pentagon.
Well, what would we do with it?
I'm only trying to give you an idea of our potential.
We have what other men have only dreamed of.
It's kinda scary, isn't it?
You bet it is.
Albert, how rich will we be?
So rich that we could not possibly spend it all.
- We could try.
- Wait a minute.
- I just want to help all I can.
- That's fine.
Don't get carried away.
We must keep our sense of values.
Aesop's Fable warns us against avarice.
- Against who?
- Greed, greed.
Fellow in the fable, he let greed destroy him.
We're gonna play it cool, keep our feet on the ground.
Albert.
What?
Let's take our cool feet and go to bed.
OK, honey.
Cute.
You oughta close the window.
He might catch cold.
Good idea.
Now what?
Some sense of values.
What do you mean?
Boy, he sure was right.
- Who was?
- You know.
I do?
Aesop!
Jimmy, your lunch.
Be sure and take good care of Charlie while I'm gone.
Don't worry, I will.
Now, run along.
And don't let Mr. Hooper's dog get him either.
Jimmy, hurry up.
You're gonna be late for school.
Yes. Who?
The bank.
Hi.
Bad cheques?
Well, you printed them.
How could a big bank like you have insufficient funds and stay in business?
No, no Mrs. Dooley.
Not us, you.
We've explained that you cannot write cheques for more money than you have.
You can be arrested for that.
No, please don't do that.
Please don't call Mr. Dooley.
I can get the money. But could you hold on the phone a minute?
Mr. Meaker, I...
I guess you'll just have to call my husband about that...
Wait.
I'll be right down.
And what is this?
I'm overdrawn, and that's to un-overdraw me.
Yes, you are overdrawn.
But what is this thing?
Thing?
That's gold, worth over 900 troy ounce dollars.
And that's my deposit slip for it.
- You recognise that, don't you?
- One moment, please.
- Next, please.
- This way, please.
What kind of a bank is this anyway?
Sit down.
Mrs. Dooley, we can hardly take a trinket for a deposit.
Trinket? Haven't you bankers ever heard of gold?
Mrs. Dooley, even if that were gold bullion, there's nothing I can...
Bullion?
Processed gold as distinguished from raw gold.
The only thing we can do with this is turn it over to the Federal Reserve.
That wouldn't do very much for your account, would it?
I should say not. I'll just take it to another bank.
They'll have to do the same thing.
The only possible place you can take that is to a refinery.
Refinery?
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
Where'd you get the hat?
What hat?
Oh, now, Albert, it was on sale.
If you wrote a check for that hat, we're overdrawn again.
No, we're not.
I deposited over 900 dollars today.
- Where did you get 900 dollars?
- From the refinery.
You haven't been in the eggs?
No, not those.
Charlie laid one for me.
Well, why did you take it to the refinery?
The bank told me to.
The bank?
You took it to the... Well, did you tell the newspapers too?
Well, no, Albert, just the bank.
They said if I didn't cover my bad cheques, I was gonna be arrested.
- Would you rather I got arrested?
- No.
Some husband.
He wants his wife in jail.
Didn't you hear Fred say not to tell anybody and not to spend the money?
But what's the use of having it?
Hi, partners.
- Don't tell him what I did.
- What did she do?
Sold an egg to a refinery.
- Good
- What?
That's all we can do. We don't have a licence to handle gold.
- Then get us a license.
- Oh, sure.
Can you see going to the
US Treasury Department and saying,
I'd like a gold licence for my duckie who lays gold eggs?
I understand what you mean.
Couldn't Hooper get it?
He works for the US Treasury.
He'd confiscate our duck so fast, it'd singe its feathers off.
- Get all the gold off the premises.
- Why?
Federal gold regulations. You could get ten years for hoarding. Read this.
We'll have to think up a good story to tell the refineries.
Why?
You try to peddle gold duck eggs, they'll lock you up in the nut farm.
Well, I did it, and they didn't lock me up.
Yes, but you're...
Wait a minute. You didn't tell them where the gold came from, did you?
Well, he asked me.
Now the whole world will be after that duck.
- What did he say when you told him?
- He just laughed.
Laughed?
He just... laughed?
Do you hear that, Albert?
He just laughed!
Don't you see?
She solved our whole problem.
She can tell them the truth, they'll never believe it.
They won't lock her up, no matter how nutty it sounds.
- Listen, sweet hard ...
- No, Fred.
I'm not so sure
I want my wife...
- What is that, Fred? A new suit?
- Ah! Listen, sweetheart.
Here's a list of refineries.
Don't sell too many eggs at one time.
Fred, what have you...
You got a new briefcase too.
It's nothing, Al baby.
Keep moving around refineries, otherwise it might look suspicious.
Got it. Could I buy some new clothes to wear for this?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
We mustn't spend the money.
- Mrs. Dooley?
- Yes.
This is exceptionally high-grade ore.
- Our cashier is making a cheque for you.
- Thank you.
These nuggets are very interesting.
- Identical size and shape.
- Yes, I noticed that.
I was curious as how they got that way.
Would you believe a duck laid them?
A duck laid 'em?
- What kind of duck was that?
- A white one.
A white one.
A little white duck.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Dooley, listen.
About these nuggets...
I really have to dash.
Bye-bye.
- We don't have your address.
- That's all right. I have it.
Treasury Department?
This is Carter down at Alco.
I got something really odd here.
You might want to check it out.
Beauty.
What's the price of that car?
 7,995 dollars.
- It's not even a dozen eggs.
- I beg your pardon?
Nothing. You wouldn't happen to have a layaway plan?
- Hardly.
- I didn't think so.
Well, I can't buy it now, but,
I'll be back.
According to the phone calls... that have been pouring into this
US Treasury Department office, this map represents certain refineries that have been receiving these... odd gold nuggets.
And we don't know who the gang is, but, undoubtedly, it's an underworld operation.
Why would they be spreading those nuggets around all those various refineries?
You figure it's
Mafia-controlled, Chief?
- Probably something worse.
- Worse?
Gentlemen, they may have learned how to make gold.
Well, that's not very probable.
That can only be done by atomic bombardment, and the cost is prohibitive.
I know that, Hooper.
The point I'm trying to make is they've found a way to make gold cheap enough to put on the market.
Our top chemists can't even identify some of the elements, and there are traces of such bizarre impurities as... apple pectin.
Apples in gold?
Don't laugh Hooper.
Remember what happened to good old, ordinary bread mould, don't you?
Penicillin.
But Mr. Morgan here of the Federal Reserve Bank... has something further to say to us on the subject.
Gentlemen, this... this thing just cannot happen.
I mean, money, money is the greatest...
What we've got to do is to...
We have got to ferret out... and stop this nefarious gang of...
Well, I, I hesitate to think... what would happen if this were to get out of this room!
Excuse me.
Rutledge here.
Yes, he is. Just a second.
Morg, for you.
President of the New York
Stock Exchange.
He says urgent.
Take it on one.
Hello, Bob
What rumour?
Synthetic gold?
Where'd you...
Where'd you hear that?
Your barber?
Oh, no, Bob
No, absolutely nothing to that.
Nothing to it at all.
Well, we have had a little flap about gold around here, but, everything is absolutely under control.
So you tell the
Wall Street to relax.
Right, Bob.
Right, Bob.
Bye Bob.
Good heavens.
How would his barber...
Rutledge here.
You again.
Take it on two.
Hello?
Yes, this is he.
The state department?
Hello, Rodge.
Oh, no, Rodge.
That's just a rumour.
Rumour or not, Ed, this could play hard with our foreign monetary agreements.
Believe me, Rodge, we are on top of this thing.
No, sirree, not a single foreign country... will hear anything about it.
Get me the US ambassador.
How dare they meddle with their gold.
It's all ours.
America is producing instant gold.
It is a plot.
If those bloody Americans are fabricating the stuff, we're done in.
Please get formula.
If Americans make it for 10 dollar an ounce, we make it 8.95.
The White House?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you don't...
Yes, sir. I fully realise that you have enough trouble without this.
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
Quite... Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, I think your duty is quite clear.
- Rutledge
- Ya?
It's in your hands.
What leads do you have on this gang, chief?
Leads.
So far the only lead we have is the name of the bag man.
Bag woman.
Known under various aliases, such as K.W. Dooley,
Katie Klaus Dooley,
Mrs. Albert Dooley,
Frances Abigail Dooley.
What was after Albert Dooley?
Why, that's my neighbour.
- Your neighbour?
- Well, it's not my fault.
I was there first.
They moved in, and I... and Albert Dooley. I knew there was something about that professor.
Really, now. A man of your age.
I was doing undercover work.
Yes, I can see that.
Hi, neighbour!
How's it going there, friend?
Fine, fine.
Having a little vacation.
I thought I'd spend it... fixing up the house.
Have fun.
Hooper suspects something.
Did you tell him anything?
You forgot to kiss me.
- Answer me. Did you?
- I haven't even talked to him.
- Well, how about Jimmy?
- I talked to him. He's our son, remember?
- I know that.
- Why are you suspicious of Hooper?
He's being friendly.
That's proof enough.
Fred?
- How about that car?
- How about that? Beauty, isn't she?
- Albert...
- Wait a minute.
What happened
"no change in living standards"?
Not only will my new idea save us a bundle...
- That's the car I had my eye on.
- Good taste.
And old Freddy boy is gonna see you get a stable full of 'em.
Why can't we have a car like that?
Katie, Katie, Katie.
Is that all you can think about, material possessions?
Here I am, slaving my head to the bone while you... Albert!
How about that for a company name?
- Dooley's Wrought Iron Sauna Baths?
- Yeah.
- What does that have to do with gold?
- Nothing.
It's a sure loser, a great tax write-off.
I can tell you we got bigger problems than that.
- You mean some new ones?
- Hooper's suspicious.
- Hooper?
- Yeah. He spoke to me.
Besides Hooper, I cannot identify the radioactive element in our gold.
If l can't do that,
I don't know what its half-life is.
- And if I don't know what its half-life is...
- What is this half-life?
The rate of disintegration of a radioactive substance.
In other words, it could run out.
Run out?
You mean our duck could stop laying gold eggs?
Exactly.
You mean that duck could be washed up right now?
- It's possible.
- Well, get it, Al.
Get it and check!
Katie!
Katie, bring the duck!
You don't have to shout.
I have 20-20 hearing.
- Where's Charlie?
- Out.
What do you mean, out?
Jimmy took him for a ride with the car's Wadlow boys.
The Wadlow boys?
Not that!
The way those maniacs drive, there goes our Charlie! Come on, Fred.
You guys said you'd take me and Charlie for a ride.
Take it easy men.
We will.
Can't you just put the battery...
Go help him.
If you're gonna hang around here, you gotta shape up, okay?
Hey, get that duck off there!
He'll fry!
Hey, Arvin, look.
He likes it.
Man, he's outta sight.
Jimmy, you wanna sell him?
We'll give you two bucks for him.
No, sir.
He's my friend.
I got an idea.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't do that, daddy!
- We're havin' fun!
- The fun's over, son.
But they're going to take me and Charlie for a ride.
Oh, no! No, no, no, they're not taking this duck in that deathtrap.
Hold on, Mr. Dooley. Doesn't that duck belong to Jimmy?
Yeah! You're violating his civil rights!
It's not a civil rights case. lt's... property rights.
Hitlers!
Albert, Jimmy's upstairs crying.
What did you do to him?
I didn't do anything to him.
I was just protecting the duck.
We can't take any more chances like that.
- We have to take it away from Jimmmy altogether.
- I think you are right.
You can't do that.
Jimmy loves that duck.
It's his pal, now you've turned against him.
What do you mean, turned against him?
This is academic if Charlie can't produce any more. Come on, Al.
Finley!
Serves you right.
Masher!
Jimmy!
Hi, Jimmy!
Getting big, aren't ya? Come here.
I got something to show you.
I'm not supposed to go into your yard.
That's all right. I've got a present for you. Come on.
That's for me?
If you want it. My little nephew outgrew it.
Boy, oh boy!
Say, this is a nice duck you've got here.
I'll bet she lays a lot of nice eggs.
Yeah, lots of them.
You know something?
I've never seen a real duck egg.
Do you suppose I could get her to lay one for me?
I don't know. My dad can.
He barks at her.
He does? He ba... At the...
Barks at the...
Why don't I try that? Come here and hold her and I'll try it.
Here we go.
Anything happen back there?
No.
- Come home now, Jimmy.
- But look at the bike Mr. Hooper...
Right now, Jimmy.
And bring Charlie. Hurry.
And you, Mr. Hooper, stealing your neighbour's eggs.
Aren't you ashamed?
That's right. Albert, he knows!
Well, no, he didn't get the egg, but...
I can't keep the duck locked up all the time. It's only human, you know.
Yes. All right.
Crisis, Fred.
Hooper's hip.
I'll meet you at the house as quick as I can sneak away from here.
Dooley?
Dooley?
Dooley!
What he has is, this little duck.
- Did you say duck?
- Yes. Duck.
I got it.
Evidently some kind of a new gangland code word.
Oh, no, just plain duck.
You know, quack, quack.
And this duck lays gold eggs.
It's true. I mean,
I saw it happen.
They bark at it.
- Bark at it?
- Yeah, like a dog.
They bark just like... And that causes the duck to lay these gold eggs.
They.
- Why, I did it myself.
- You?
You laid a gold egg,
Hooper?
Oh, yeah. It wasn't easy, but...
No! I didn't...
I barked at it.
The duck, it laid the gold egg.
Yes, well.
Certainly very interesting,
Hooper.
Look, why don't you stop by my office sometime tomorrow... and you and me have a little chat?
But, Chief, wait a minute.
I know it sounds...
You confiscate the duck, and I'll prove it.
How long you been with the department now?
- It was after Prohibition.
- Chief.
There may be something to this. I checked with a Dr. Gottlieb at the university lab, and he said something about Dooley trying to make gold out of eggs.
I thought he was putting me on.
But now, after Hooper tell's us...
Aren't those nuggets all about the same size as an egg yolk?
So... Stop that!
It's all some fairy-tale talk...
Sure, but look at the facts.
Hello, Hooper, here.
Yes, Mr. Morgan. No, we haven't struck yet, but it's a duck.
- Lays gold eggs. Duck.
- Let me have that.
Hi, Morg.
Rutledge here.
Thank you. Same to you.
Yes, there does seem to be a certain degree of duck involvement.
We don't know just ex...
Oh, no, duck.
D-U... Yeah.
Oh, not a word.
Not a word's gotten out.
A duck?
Try to trade them for it.
Offer them all their gold.
Sell all our mines and buy up every duck from here to Cape Town.
Get the blueprint of a US duck.
Make same thing.
Plastic, half-price.
Just let me say this about that.
Get that duck!
Do you understand?
- Get that duck!
- Bye-bye.
All right, men.
We're moving in.
Here's the strategy.
- Katie, where's Charlie?
- Upstairs with Jimmy.
Good.
Where's the egg?
That's what we want. We got to get rid of the duck.
You got any more of these?
We gotta get rid of 'em.
Albert.
What are you doing?
- I handle the eggs.
- I'm trying to help.
I know and I'm telling you
I'm the egg man!
- Finley, where are you going?
- Not now, Eunice, please.
- Let go of my egg.
- lt's my egg, too, Albert.
This is enough! Albert, go upstairs and get the duck.
Now, wait just a minute, Katie.
I will decide what I am going to do!
I'm going upstairs and get the duck.
Hello there, neighbour.
I thought you'd like to meet my colleagues at the treasury department.
- This is Mr. Rutledge, Smith...
- It's a pleasure.
I hope you can come back when I'm not so busy.
Mr. Dooley...
Being treasury men doesn't mean you can barge in without a search warrant.
Right here.
There you are.
Dooley, Mr. Rutledge wants to see your duck.
What duck?
- Come on now, Dooley.
- You mean my little boy's pet?
Mr. Dooley, we have an eyewitness... who will attest to the fact that you have a duck that lays... gold eggs.
Gold eggs?
Why'd you do a dumb thing like that for?
41,000 dollars worth of eggs, and not one cent of income tax has been declared.
This duck of yours could be the most single valuable asset in the United States today.
That duck is a natural resource.
Like Hoover Dam.
That duck is entitled to the protection of the US Government.
You have no proof that my client's duck lays gold eggs.
I understand that the duck will produce on command.
That's right. I've done it myself.
You bark at it.
I'll get the duck.
Now, wait a minute.
You have your rights.
- I'd like to confer with my client.
- You got thirty seconds.
Are you outta your mind?
I'll bark in the wrong pitch, and she won't produce.
- She won't cross us up?
- No way.
- I'll get the duck.
- I think I'd better.
He might not give it to you.
He's not crazy about you all this days.
- Beckert, don't let her out of your sight.
- No.
I am not going upstairs with some strange man.
It's okay.
- He's gone.
- The duck?
- No, Jimmy.
- Went out the window with the duck.
- They're both gone?
- Dooley, you tricked us.
- Shut up!
- Don't just everybody stand there.
- You please, go out and find him.
- I'll handle this.
Beckert, Smith,
Forbes, outside.
Deploy, cover the area.
Hooper, stick with me.
Katie's right.
We have to find that duck.
Not the duck, Fred, my son!
Mrs. Hooper. Did you see the Dooley kid come out of his house?
- With a duck?
- I sure did.
He got a bicycle out of our garage and took off.
- Which way did he go?
- That way.
Hey, Forbes!
Come on! Let's go!
Eunice, why don't you watch what you're doing?
Poor Jimmy. If we'd never gotten that darn duck.
Honey, we'll find him.
There's the bike.
Come on.
Chief, look!
Turn around and let's go!
There, Chief.
Search that truck.
Get up.
Not in there.
- What are you bums doin' in my truck?
- Sorry, sir.
This is US official United States
Government business.
We know you got a duck here somewhere.
Duck?
I know.
This is Candid Camera, right?
Where is it?
Hooper, check that garbage can.
Okay, Mac. Move.
Let's check the rest of the alley.
There's no sign of him here.
- There they are. Follow them!
- Wait for us!
Come on, boy.
Charlie!
Charlie!
- What are you doing?
- Charlie!
Stop it!
Come here!
The guy in the truck swerved to miss the duck.
It's Jimmy.
What could I do?
What are you, some kind of a nut?
- Come on. Come on.
- Don't let 'em get Charlie.
- Who's after him?
- Everybody, even the government.
The government?
Come on, Arvin. Hurry.
- All right. Cool it.
- Come on, Charlie. You're mine.
There they are!
The Wadlows have 'em.
Never mind that! Get up here.
Move that car outta the way!
I said, move it!
Watch out!
Wait. They're always ready.
We need 'em.
- Get in.
- Should we leave a note for somebody?
Get in, get in, get in!
Albert! Jump on!
Stop this thing.
He's gonna be killed up there.
- Try and lower him.
- How do you work this crazy thing?
Hey, Fred!
Turn right at the next corner!
Hey, Fred, watch it!
That was a red light.
Look what they're chasing us with.
I sure gotta hand it to your old man, Jimmy. He's something else.
For crying out loud,
Fred, take it easy!
Hang on, Albert!
Fred, Fred!
What are you trying to do, kill me?
Trek.
Stop truck, you're gonna decaptivate him!
- What are you trying to pull now, Dooley?
- What do you think, Hooper?
I'm waiting for a streetcar!
Go, Forbes.
After 'em.
Here we go.
Get around that fool truck, and we got 'em.
Come on. Pass 'em.
Your dad's cool, but he is a show-off.
Hold it!
You gotta have a ticket!
Swing on back to that garage, Forbes.
We got 'em now.
You can't make a U-turn here, stupid!
Thank you.
Move along, folks. Break it up.
It's official United States
Government business.
No wonder you got everything loused up!
Fred, the boys are in the parking garage.
Wait a minute, you can't bring this thing in here.
- My son is in here.
- I don't care who's in here.
Get this outta here!
Will you please take my money?
I'm in a hurry.
- This mother's child...
- Will you get this thing out!
Over there.
Come on.
Run! Move it!
Over you go Jimmy.
Arvin, a ladder.
Here.
Jimmy!
Over you go.
- Jimmy, where are you?
- Be brave, pal.
Attaboy.
Easy does it, boy.
There you go, Jimmy.
Help!
Hang on, Jimmy we'll get ya.
We'll find something...
Jimmy.
Don't move.
Don't move, son.
- Jimmy.
- Go away, daddy!
- Jimmy, give me your hand.
- You just want Charlie.
Jimmy, put your hand in mine.
Go away, daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy, help!
Help!
Oh, Jimmy.
Oh, my son.
Get it, Hooper.
Daddy, don't let 'em take Charlie.
Don't let 'em.
Sorry, son. There's nothing
I can do about that now.
Charlie, Charlie!
I'm sorry, sonny.
We got to put Charlie under protective custody for his own good.
Jimmy, let's go home.
I'll explain it all to you later.
- So long, gentlemen.
- No.
You're not going home. You're coming with us. You're under arrest.
Arrest?
Suspicion of violation of federal gold regulations.
- He didn't mean to.
- Ah, sorry. Come on, Dooley.
At least you're lucky, old boy.
Lucky?
My son disowned me. I've lost a fortune.
And I've just been arrested.
But you've got a darned good lawyer to handle your case.
Thanks you, Fred.
What's that duck really worth?
Sorry, gentlemen!
You can't get in the trial.
We handle riot cases, rapes and spies, but a rich duck?
Mr. Hooper, did you actually witness the duck lay a golden egg?
Yes, sir.
- Did you make it perform this feat?
- I did, indeed.
- Would you demonstrate it for us, sir?
- I'd be happy to.
It's the wrong pitch, isn't it?
- Your Honour, he's not doing it right.
- Albert, sit down.
I'd like to get this out in the open.
If that duck can lay gold eggs, then we should establish that.
If we've done wrong,
I accept the consequences.
- You're outta your mind.
- If we lose the duck, so be it.
It's just that now I know that there are things... a darn sight more valuable to me.
Excuse me.
One more time, Charlie.
There's the evidence, Your Honour.
Break that open and look inside of that.
You're gonna get it now.
It's run out.
Finished.
Case dismissed.
Lack of evidence.
But, Your Honour, the defendant has 40,000 dollars in various banks.
Well, good for him.
Since when are we against the accumulation of a few dollars as a result of individual initiative?
This country was built on enterprise and ingenuity.
Let's don't lose that.
Only bad thing is the professor won't be able to keep the money after he pays his income tax on it.
You know, for a worthless creature, you sure have caused a lot of trouble.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Your Honour but, you're wrong about this duck being worthless.
It has great value.
It was just that I was confused about what that value was.
Really?
- Forever?
- Really forever, pal.
One word of caution, son.
If it ever lays another gold egg, bury it... quick.

THE END
SUBTITLING BY
TGA
Hey, buds below
Up is where to grow
Up, with which below
Can't compare with
Hurry
It's lovely up here
Life down a hole
Takes an awful toll
What with not a soul there
To share with
Hurry, it's lovely up here
Wake up
Bestir yourself
It's time that you disinter yourself
You've got a spot to fill
A pot to fill
And what a gift package
Of shower, sun and love
You'll be met above everywhere
With fondled and sniffed
By millions who drift by
Life here is rosy
If you're a posy
Hurry, it's lovely here
Climb up, geranium
It can't be fun subterranean
On the exterior
It's cheerier
R.S. V.P., peonies
Pollinate the breeze
Make the queen of bees
Hot as brandy
Come give at least
A preview of Easter
Come up
And see the hoot we're giving
Come up
And see the grounds for living
Come poke your head out
Open up and spread out
Hurry, it's lovely here
On a clear day
You can see forever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You'll feel part of
Every mountain, sea and shore
You can hear from far and near
A world you never
Never heard before
And on a clear day
On a clear day
You can see forever and ever
And ever
And evermore
And now the window opens.
It gently, gently opens, and the night steals softly in.
Your eyelids now are heavy.
Your arms are numb and heavy.
Your legs are dull and heavy and you give yourself to sleep.
A deep sleep.
He's under. Lights, please.
I'll begin with posthypnotic suggestion, and after, if Preston here is a good subject, regression.
- When does this class meet again?
- On Wednesday, sir.
On Wednesday.
Mr Preston, after I waken you, the first time I say the word
"Wednesday," you will take off your left shoe and sock and put them on again.
Remember, the first time
I say the word "Wednesday."
Now for regression.
I will try and take Preston back through his life to the age of 5.
Stand up and turn around, please.
I want you to go back in time to your 20th birthday.
- Dr Chabot.
- No questions now.
Now, five years more to your 15th birthday.
Now, five years more to your 10th.
Now, another five years, and when I count to three and snap my fingers, you will be 5 years old.
Five years old, at your first day of school.
One, two...
Give me back my chalk, Henry.
Come on, Henry Tillsbury.
You give me back my chalk, or I'll throw the glue at you and you'll get all gooey.
- Sit down, Preston.
- Oh, Henry, I am not sitting
- on your turtle. Honest.
- What's her name?
- Miss Hildebrand, you gotta make...
- Doesn't anybody know who she is?
Sleep.
To be hypnotized indirectly is very common, but to be regressed indirectly is not only unusual but a little nerve-wracking.
Listen to me.
You are no longer 5 years old.
You are as you are today.
And when I count to three and snap my fingers, you will awaken feeling fine.
One, two, three.
How do you feel?
Fine.
What happened?
I mean, how did I get over here?
You were hypnotized by mistake.
- Your mistake or mine?
- I suppose it was a bit of both.
I opened the window, but you fell out.
- What's your name?
- Daisy Gamble.
You're not a medical student, are you?
No.
Did everybody, I mean, you know, fall out?
No. No, just you.
Just me?
I'm awfully sorry, doctor.
I didn't mean to butt in, I...
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, everybody.
I mean, I didn't mean to butt in.
Please, go on with your act.
It won't happen to me again.
Boy, you can swing open that window all you want, and when the night starts crawling in, my eyelids won't get heavy and my arms get numb and heavy and my legs get dull and heavy and...
When I count to three and press your forehead, you will awaken and stay awake.
- One, two, three.
- Oh, God.
Why don't you step outside and get a little air.
Sure. I mean, sure.
Have you got a cigarette, please?
I'm awfully sorry, doctor. Really.
Do you have a match?
Oh, thank you very...
Doctor, I'm awfully sorry, kids, really.
Push.
Sorry.
Preston, you are no longer
5, 10, 15 or 20.
You are as you are now.
And when I count to three and snap my fingers, you will awaken.
One, two, three.
Do you feel all right?
- Yes, sir.
- What is it?
Sir, nothing happened to me.
I didn't go under.
Most people don't believe they do the first time.
- Well, I know that, sir...
- But that is not your case.
Oh, no, sir. No. Is that all?
On Wednesday, when we meet again, I want to discuss...
- What are you doing there?
- Taking off my shoe and...
...sock.
- Any particular reason, or just bored?
See you all Wednesday.
Out like a light.
If you don't remember, he was telling you to take off your shoes and socks.
Oh, Marc, did you receive one of these?
Oh, just routine meeting, nothing important.
Doctor, could I see you for just one minute, please?
- Don't you feel well?
- Yeah, sure, sure.
But I gotta talk to you about something important.
If you call my secretary...
I'll see you this afternoon.
- She'll make an appointment.
- But it's just one question, that's all.
Couldn't you ask me at a Wednesday lecture?
If you come a little early,
I'm sure it's possible...
Oh, my God.
Come in. Come here, hey.
Come, come.
This way, please. This way.
Come in. Here.
Yes. Come in, come in.
This way, this way, please.
Here, come in.
You're doing that on posthypnotic suggestion.
Oh, no.
Turn around.
I'm terribly sorry.
Is anything else coming off?
- Of course not. Here, your shoe.
- You're sure?
That's quite a weapon you have got there.
Boy, you fellas must have one glorious night after another.
I mean...
What's the matter?
- This just isn't my day.
- Come. Come sit down.
You'll feel better in a moment.
Sit down.
- Oh, God.
- Now, what did...?
Oh, rats.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Don't you hate cigarettes?
Now, what did you want to ask me?
What I wanted to ask you was this:
Doctor, do you think...?
I mean, can people really be hypnotized out of something?
I mean, of something like smoking.
It's stuck in the dictionary. I mean, can you see how yellow my fingers are?
I beg your pardon?
Aren't you looking for a piece of paper with an address on it?
- Yes.
- Don't you have a dictionary?
Well, yes.
Well, just see if it's in there.
You see, the other night I heard this discussion going on in the bathtub, on the radio, and this man said...
It's under X.
He said you could be hypnotized out of it without getting something else instead, you know, like fat or nervous or acne.
- Miss...
- Gamble.
What about this address?
- Isn't that the one you're looking for?
- Yes, but how did you do it?
I don't know. I just saw you looking around for something and wondered what it was and...
You know, I knew.
Very well,
I won't pry into trade secrets.
Yeah.
About this yellow-finger problem...
Can you do any other tricks?
No. You see, I only have until tomorrow night, and I was desperate.
And that's why I busted on your lecture, so I could meet you...
What else do you do?
Come on, you can trust me.
Well...
...sometimes...
...I do get the feeling when the phone's gonna ring.
Or when someone' s gonna drop in.
So I wait.
And sometimes I can tell when people are thinking about me, so I'll go to see them.
I mean, you know, if I like them.
And that's about all.
No.
That's all. That's all.
I make flowers grow.
- You make flowers grow?
- Fast. I mean, fast.
And how do you do that?
I don't know.
Doctor, about these cigarettes...
Well, why don't you just make them disappear.
I don't blame you.
I know it sounds...
It sounds so silly.
Well, never mind, doctor.
I'm really sorry I bothered you.
Thanks anyway.
Oh, answer your phone.
Yes?
Yes, Dr Chabot speaking.
Yes, Conrad. I'm coming.
Order me a...
Double whiskey.
And you thought she saw it sticking out of the dictionary on the other side of the room.
Remarkable, isn't it?
- And you think it was a trick?
- She couldn't have guessed it.
Marc, I know as a psychiatrist
I could have my couch taken away from me for this, but you don't think by any chance this could be a case of extrasensory perception, ESP?
All right.
Find the girl, hypnotize her and prove to yourself whether or not it was a trick.
You're against scientific research?
How can ESP be called a science when there is no scientific proof
- that ESP exists?
- What do you mean, exists?
Two people have the same thought at the same time.
It's happened millions of times.
It exists, but psychiatry calls it coincidence.
- That's what it is.
- Many people are not so certain,
- and for a very good scientific reason.
- Rubbish.
Pure, unadulterated rubbish.
Violet. Lily. Rose.
Mrs Hatch?
This is my address for that lunch tomorrow.
- You can type it now.
- Oh, doctor, there's a...
When you've finished, telephone every student in my 11:00 class until you find someone who remembers the name of the girl
I hypnotized by mistake this morning and...
Oh, you mean Daisy Gamble?
Will you please tell me how you knew that?
Well, she told me.
She's in the waiting room.
- Miss Gamble?
- Oh, hello, doctor.
Hello. This way, please.
- No calls, Mrs Hatch.
- I'll go to work on your address.
Did you lose another one?
No. Follow me.
- Now, Miss Gamble...
- I'll make it quick.
Do you know the name of a good hypnotist I can go and talk to and see if he could help me lay off these cigarettes before tomorrow night, or else
Warren won't get that job, see?
Then I won't bother you any more.
Do you understand? Understand.
You don't even know who Warren is.
Oh, he's my fiancé.
Go on.
- Go on?
- Yes.
Well, you see, over here, you know, in the United States, they have these big companies that send out these personnel directors to these colleges to sign up the bright students and their wives.
Well, Warren...
Remember? He's my fiancé.
He's graduating in the top 2 percent of the business school and Chemical Foods, Inc., wanna give him a lifetime contract, see, and I can ruin it. I mean, you know, if they don't like me.
I mean, that's that.
And they're not gonna like me.
Because Warren told me, you know, that they don't like addicts, and I'm an addict.
And I'm an addicted addict.
I can't stop unless somebody like you can make me.
Is that possible?
It's possible, provided it's not a symptom of neurosis, or...
No, no, I'm normal. I swear.
I'm just an addict, that's all.
Last year I took some of these vocational-guidance tests, you know, not for a job, but for Warren to get to know me better, and you know the results?
What?
Healthy, adjusted and no character.
I mean, no character of any kind.
I mean, not even any characteristics.
You see, tomorrow night,
I've gotta have dinner with Warren and one of these personnel directors.
So, what do I do about these rotten, miserable...?
Do you want one?
No, no, thank you.
How old are you, Miss Gamble?
Twenty-two.
And how old were you when you started smoking?
Twelve. See, I had this cousin, Harvey, who came to visit us, and he was smoking.
You know, he dared me to try.
Well, he was only 9, what could I do?
Of course.
Miss Gamble,
I will try to help you today.
But from tomorrow on, you'll have to go to someone else.
And if you call me tomorrow, I'll give you the name of another doctor.
Sit here, please.
- You mean now?
- Yes, now.
Oh, doctor. I don't know how I can ever thank you. I mean, really, that is...
- I didn't expect, you know...
- Never mind that, just sit down.
Good.
Please.
That's it.
Just relax now.
Relax.
Now, Miss Gamble, I want you to try, if you can, to imagine that you see...
I see it.
- What?
- A window.
That's right, a window.
Now, keep staring at that window until slowly, very slowly, the window begins...
It's open.
That's right.
And now the dark of night is...
Oh, well, you know the rest, go on.
- Can you hear me, Miss Gamble?
- Yes.
Miss Gamble, if you truly wish to stop smoking,
I would like you to raise your left hand.
Drop your hand.
When I awaken you, you will find that your desire for cigarettes will grow less and less, and when you want a cigarette, your ability to resist it will grow stronger and stronger.
- Do you understand, Miss Gamble?
- Yes.
Good.
Now, open your eyes.
Miss Gamble, this morning you were kind enough to help me find an address I'd lost.
- Do you remember?
- Yes.
It was quite a trick.
Do you know how you did it?
Yes.
I thought so. How?
Well,
I saw you looking around for something and I wondered what it was.
And all of a sudden I knew.
- You knew what?
- Where it was.
- That's all?
- That's all.
I see.
- Do you really?
- Of course, a child can understand it.
Who taught it to you?
I don't know. I suppose I got it from Winnie Wainwhisle.
Who is she?
- Nobody.
- Nobody?
I mean, nobody anymore.
She's dead.
But before she died she taught it to you.
- No.
- No?
No.
- But you said you got it from her.
- Yeah.
Can you remember an incident when you saw Winnie Wainwhisle perform the same trick?
Oh, sure, lots of them.
- Just one.
- Okay.
Where did it happen?
In London.
- You know, in England?
- London?
- What were you doing in London?
- I was with Winnie Wainwhisle.
Was it lately?
Well, was it before you were 15?
Before you were 10?
- Yeah.
- Before you were 5?
- What was it she found?
- A gold locket.
I see.
- It was the one my husband gave me.
- Oh, really.
And how old was your little husband?
Three and a half? Four?
No. He was...
Let's see, 59. Yeah, that's right.
Because he was exactly
35 years older than I.
- What?
- Than me?
Thirty-five years older?
Well, I know it's a lot, but he was rich and he had a title, so, what the hell.
That would make you 24.
How did you get to be 24?
Well, after 23.
But that makes you two years older than when you sat down.
Miss Gamble, how can you go back to a time before you were 5 and say you are 24?
Explain that to me further.
Miss Gamble.
Yes?
What year are you remembering?
Now, listen carefully. You're saying that you were alive in 1814.
Very well. I want you to tell me everything you can about yourself, beginning with your name.
You do remember your name?
My name?
Gee, I don't know if I can do that.
I mean, boy, that's tough.
- I'm Daisy Gamble.
- Take your time.
Maybe I was called something else once...
...but the only name I...
I mean, my name has always...
My name is...
My name is Melinda.
Melinda Winifred Waine Tentrees.
And I am appalled and stunned at this outrageous inquisition.
- Inquisition, Lady Tentrees?
- From the day this trial began, you have been coiled like a cobra ready to strike.
Trying to make me crawl and cower and cringe and admit to your monstrous lies.
But you shall not succeed.
I shall speak only the truth.
I hope so.
Now you say your name is Melinda Tentrees?
Would you tell the court what knowledge you have of the tragic voyage of the frigate Westerly.
I know nothing about that unfortunate vessel except that it sailed.
Yet you advised your husband not to insure the Westerly.
How did you know it would never return?
You have asked me that question again and again.
I have answered it again and again.
The Caroline sailed two days after the Westerly, also never to return, insurance also rejected by
Pelham of London, upon your advice.
How did you know it would never return?
I do not know.
I do not know.
You don't know if your name is
Melinda Tentrees?
Of course I know my name is
Melinda Tentrees, dunce.
And I also know my husband's name and how old we are and where we live, the street, the number and the city.
- I have a breathtaking grasp of things.
- How long have you been married?
Robert and I have been married for three tumultuous, passionate,
Scheherazadian years.
Your husband must be remarkable for his age.
He's remarkable for any age.
- But still, at 59.
- Fifty-nine? Ass!
That was my first husband.
Robert is 31.
What was your first husband's name?
Lord Percy Moorepark.
Poor, fumbling, old, rich thing.
But you heard a witness testify to having seen you on the London docks on the night of November 14th, consorting in secret with a known enemy of the crown.
- He lies!
- Wait, wait, wait.
I'm so glad you interrupted.
I cannot bear this trial another minute.
- What are you on trial for?
- Oh, please.
Very well, never mind.
You were going to tell me about an incident when Winnie Wainwhisle finds something for you.
Yes.
It was the day I first met Robert.
What a glorious day it was.
- Where are you?
- Where we met.
At the Royal Pavilion at Brighton three years ago.
Percy. Percy, put on your spectacles at once.
Hurry.
Now look directly across the lawn.
Do you see Diana Smallwood?
- Unmistakably Diana Smallwood.
- Who is that with her?
Robert Tentrees.
- What does he do?
- As little as possible.
Joseph Pelham was complaining about him the other day.
He knows Tentrees' father and gave the boy a position.
Maritime insurance.
You know, old ships at sea.
- Is he married?
- No.
But he should have been, many times.
And he will be soon.
I can't wait to hear how you arrange that.
My dearest love
Who existed in a dream
Till this evening
When a wave came
And swept me out to sea
None of the loves
That you have known
Could prepare you for the love
Raging everywhere in me
For all the arms
That have covered you
The hands that have touched you
And the lips you have lingered on
Before
Added together would be less
Than an olive
In the banquet of love
I have in store
Love seasoned to entice
Love with all the trimmings
Filled with spice
Love flavoured to your whim
Served piping hot
With all the trimmings
For I'll decode every breath
And every sigh
Till your every lover's wish
Is fulfilled before it's made
Toss in some jealousy and doubt
Should it be required
Not rest till there's
Nothing more desired
Thus loving as I do
Never, never will you ever be untrue
Having love with all the trimmings
Waiting home
For you
Gentlemen. His Highness.
Chef, my good fellow.
Your Royal Highness.
Never in history have taste buds been so delectably treated as they were tonight with your extraordinary salmon mousse.
Served with cream and vin rouge sauce.
Garnished with truffles and exotic herbs.
You seem to know this woman.
Who is she?
Winnie Wainwhisle.
Do you have a name for this, if I may be allowed a Gallic pun, this chef-d'oeuvre?
Yes, with pleasure.
Come this way.
I humbly christen it
Salmon Beurre Brigette.
- To my chef.
- To the chef.
- Melinda.
- Mum.
- Is that your mother?
- Yes.
How are you, Melinda?
Mum, did you ever hear of Robert Tentrees?
Robert Tentrees?
He's not your kind, Melinda.
Hasn't got a halfpenny to his name.
- Here, I got something for you.
- What?
- Your locket.
- Where'd you find it?
Under the ambassador's night table.
- Well, that's a bit of luck.
- What about this Robert Tentrees?
- Is he here tonight?
- Mum.
Mum, he's here, and I met him. And
I love him and I'm gonna marry him.
- Marry him?
- But you've got a husband.
I'll divorce him.
And don't you worry about us not having any money.
In two years' time,
I'll make Robert Tentrees one of the richest men in England.
That good-for-nothing.
How in the world do you expect to make the likes of...?
No.
No, Melinda. Don't misuse your talents. Please.
Or God knows in how many lifetimes you'll be paying for it.
What talents?
What is she talking about?
Well.
- There you are, milady.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
For I'll decode every breath
And every sigh
Till your every lover's wish
Is fulfilled before it's made
Toss in some jealousy and doubt
Should it be required
Not rest till there's
Nothing more desired
Thus loving as I do
Never, never will you ever be untrue
Having love with all the trimmings
Waiting home
For you
And just how do you expect to get a divorce?
I'm going to be caught red-handed, dearie. That's how.
Caught red-handed.
- There.
- Where?
Here.
Oh, Percy.
Percy, I knew you'd leave your spectacles at home. Here.
Here is your other pair.
Oh, thank you very much.
And is it not true, Lady Moorepark, that in the pursuit of illicit passion, you and Robert Tentrees met regularly?
Yes. We met frequently, in secret.
Lady Tentrees, I suggest that you have committed perjury to this court and that you have consorted with those involved in the treasonous plot against king and country to destroy 38 British ships at sea.
No! You are trying to make a criminal out of me.
What? One moment, now.
You admit to these indiscretions?
I am under oath.
I cannot lie. Yes.
Not one written message.
I am under oath. I cannot lie.
- No!
- Wait a moment, now.
I beg you to consider that she has cheated her...
- Confess a lie!
- Treason...
- Never...
- Stop.
Oh, thank you. I'm exhausted.
- So am I.
- I can't go on with this.
I can't.
I just can't.
Neither can I.
No more questions.
You may sleep until I count to three.
Then you will awaken completely refreshed and you'll remember nothing.
Except to smoke less.
Now, sleep.
- Mrs Hatch.
- Yes, doctor?
I've recorded this session.
After I leave, would you make three copies of it, please.
And send one to Dr Conrad Fuller.
One, two, three.
How do you feel?
Fine. How'd I do?
Beyond my wildest expectations.
Do you think I'll smoke less tomorrow night?
I mean, you know, more normal?
Yes, I think so.
Oh, Dr Chabot, if there's anything I can ever do for you,
I mean, really, just, you know, anything.
Pronounce my name "Chabot."
Isn't it C-H-A-B-O-T?
Yes, Chabot.
Oh, well, anything you say.
Thank you.
Well.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
The...
Thank you.
Tad.
Tad.
- Hi.
- Well, well. How are you?
- What are you doing here?
- Well, you know.
Same old thing.
- Looking for myself.
- Yeah, but what are you doing here?
Well, I thought I might take a course in anatomy.
Maybe I'll find out how you do all those wonderful things.
No. Oh, for Pete's sake, don't say anything about that around here.
I mean, will you?
I mean, for Pete's sake.
Why? It's... It's not un-American.
I mean, you've got some kind of psychic power, that's all.
- I think it's beautiful.
- Yeah, to you, maybe.
That's because you're a nut.
Daisy, a lot of people are psychic.
Fine. I'm sure they're all very nice, but that is not the group
I'd like to be known as in.
I mean, if Warren ever found out, he'd never forgive me.
He thinks I'm, you know, normal.
Normal?
Nobody even knows what normal is.
Warren does.
I did write to you about Warren and me, didn't I?
What are you looking at?
I think you're sexier.
You think sexier? I thought you were noticing that I'm not smoking.
- Oh, here, excuse me...
- No, no, no! I'm trying to quit.
Where are they? No, no, thanks.
Darn.
Two hours and seven minutes without a weed.
I gotta tell the doctor.
Doctor? What doctor?
I went to this doctor, you know, to help me stop smoking.
You went to a doctor for that? Why?
Because five packs a day is just un-normal.
- Oh, Warren.
- Yeah.
That's him. The one in the chair.
Isn't he dynamic?
Hey, you wanna see the job I'm really interested in? I mean, this is terrific.
They've got the finest retirement plan I've ever seen, and the pension starts
15 years before retirement.
- Fifteen years?
- Can you imagine?
You see, compensation when you're sick doubles.
They pay for any operation, including surgery, and in the event of mental breakdown, they pick up the tab for the sanitarium for you or your wife, in the event that she passes.
Boy, when I stop to think I almost settled for that job in Paris, I could...
What the hell is she growing here,
Yosemite National Park?
I don't know how she does it.
- I planted mine the very same day.
- Where are yours?
There.
Oh, boy, this is embarrassing.
She's gotta cut that out.
I'm so worried about my nicotine stains.
- Daisy, Daisy, I've gotta talk to you.
- Warren, this is Tad Pringle.
- Hi, fella. Daisy, I've gotta talk to you...
- He used to be my brother.
Really? Your what?
Well, not actually. I mean, his father was married to my mother once.
Eight years ago. Daisy and I were very happy. Our parents weren't.
The judge stopped the fight in the third year.
That's very interesting.
Daisy... You'll... Daisy.
Daisy, I've gotta talk to you about tomorrow night.
Now, how do you feel?
You nervous?
- Well, l...
- Swell. Just a couple of points to integrate into the image.
Now, tomorrow night, before dinner, no whiskey and no martinis.
- Sherry. It's more feminine. Got it?
- Sherry? But I throw up when l...
Swell. Remember about the dress?
Not too low and not too high.
You see, Unkstadder's wife is coming.
And if she catches him looking up anything or down anything, that's it.
So tomorrow night, you're a boy.
Oh, and, Daisy, for God's sake, no opinions.
I mean, talk all you want if you need anything, but no opinions.
See, they don't like women to have opinions.
In fact, they don't really like women.
They like wives and mothers.
Let me see your fingers.
Come on, Daisy. Let me see...
Can't you get that nicotine off?
From the knuckles down, you look like Ho Chi Minh.
Warren, don't worry.
You'll never guess what l...
Come here, Daisy,
I want you to see this.
This is our whole future.
Security unlimited.
Just a few years' work and we can relax for the rest of our lives.
Yes? Oh, hello, Conrad.
Did you read the transcript?
What you think?
It's amazing, isn't it?
The names? Well, like all these cases, she must have gotten them from friends or books or movies.
Look them up?
In what?
Books about England.
Conrad, if you're implying that this could be a case of reincarnation, you are sicker than she is.
No, no, I can't see her anymore.
I have no time for all that nonsense.
See you tomorrow.
And from now on, you will find the third puff of every cigarette will have a bitter, bitter taste.
Remember, the third puff.
Open your eyes.
Now, Miss Gamble, yesterday you claimed to recall a previous life when your name was
Melinda Waine Moorepark Tentrees.
There's a Winifred in there.
Yes, I know. Now, where did you get the name Melinda?
From my aunt.
She was the fattest woman in London.
- In London?
- Yeah.
They used to say that the duke of Westminster owned everything in London except one acre, my aunt.
That's very funny.
Then you definitely have been to London?
Oh, yeah.
How many times?
- Once.
- For how long?
Twenty-eight years.
Twenty-eight years?
How old were you when you left?
Twenty-eight years.
Are you saying that you left because you...
...died?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
I just hated to die at 28.
I just hope I don't have to do it again.
It's better than 22.
But tell me, how did you ever climb from the kitchen maid's daughter to Lady Moorepark?
How?
Because of a lesson
I learned at the orphanage where my impoverished mother placed me as a child.
Where was your father?
Don't be rude.
Our postman, Mr Pimpleton.
And this is Mrs Brickstone himself.
I scrubbed, oh.
And scrubbed, oh.
And scrubbed, oh.
And I ate.
For recreation, I plotted my escape.
I knew the exact location of the hitching post on the other side of the wall.
And I had practiced with this rope for almost two years.
Up and up I went toward freedom.
My new quarters.
I looked around and thought,
"Oh, dear."
Thirty days in this dungeon with nothing to do.
I found something to do.
Every night, I heard voices on the other side of the wall, which aroused my curiosity.
Cor blimey, a secret room.
Just the sort of place you expect to find a buried treasure.
And what did I find?
A buried treasure.
Next to the name of every child in the school was the name of the real, unknown father.
Except mine, of course.
It was lord this and the duke of that and the earl of whatnot.
And as I turned the pages, suddenly, through the dank mustiness of the room,
I realized that I had in my hands the sort of stuff that sent the flower of English manhood out into the world to create an empire and might very well create a little empire for me.
My letters were simple and honest:
"Dear lord so-and-so, if you do not wish your child to know who you are, please send 1 pound a month.
Sincerely..."
He sent 1, and he sent 1.
And so did lots of others.
In fact, business was marvellous.
Until one day, a nasty, dishonest child stole my letters.
To my joy and happiness,
I was expelled.
When I saw the glow those pound notes brought to my dear mother's eyes,
I made a firm resolution.
"Melinda," I said,
"let this be a lesson to you.
Never, never do anything except for money."
But what about Robert Tentrees?
He had no money and you married him, didn't you?
True, he had not a penny to his name.
But love is the exception to every rule, is it not?
You're crying.
Why?
I should have known that one day he would desert me.
Desert you?
He was too weak to be faithful.
Why didn't I see that?
Is love so blind?
No.
But mistrust is so exhausting.
It's not easy to be a strong woman, Melinda.
A man must be strong for you to respect him, but weak for you to love him.
And love makes the choice.
That's very clever of you.
Very clever.
Who are you, exactly?
I could ask the same of you.
But you seem to know me better than I know myself.
That's because
I may have invented you.
Now, what does that mean?
Or don't you know either?
Oh, dear.
I'm suddenly a little...
A little...
Oh, boy, am I beat.
You must be.
What's the matter with me?
There was never Melinda.
Robert never existed.
How could someone who never existed desert someone who never lived?
And when I heard it, why did it make me so sad?
No.
None of this is true.
None of it happened.
It's nothing but shadows and echoes of things that never were.
This is a dream, Melinda
Just a mirage, so they say
This whole affair
They all declare
Was dreamed each step of the way
You're a mere dream, Melinda
Out for a gay little spin
Dealing me lies before my eyes
Of days that never have been
There's no Melinda
They say for sure
But don't go, Melinda
I know and you know
That you're no mere dream, Melinda
Gone when the dawn
Glimmers through
You and I know that long ago
Before the dream there was you
There
Once
Was you
Damn you, Melinda.
If I'm not on guard every moment, you steal across the border into reality.
There have been thousands of cases like yours.
And every one, without exception, has been traced to something in the person's life.
This life.
Daisy Gamble, somewhere in some closet of your mind is the key to all this.
And I intend to find it.
If I have to squeeze out of you every moment of your whole boring little life.
So en garde.
One, two, three.
Hi.
How do you feel?
Fine. Did I do all right?
I think so.
How was the smoking last night and today?
Oh, much better. If the phone hadn't rung this morning,
I wouldn't have smoked until breakfast.
Do you always smoke on the telephone?
Well, you've got to.
I mean, you just got to.
I mean, you got this hand left over doing nothing.
Of course, I usually hear it before it rings and light up ahead of time.
Of course.
Where are you meeting Warren?
At the Americana.
Can I give you a lift?
- Oh, thanks.
- Good.
You know?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You sure I'm not gonna take you out of your way?
No, you're not. Not at all.
I'm going to the Metropolitan Museum.
It's open tonight and there's an exhibition of English painters that I want to see.
Oh, that's nice.
England's had some very good painters.
I don't know much about it, really.
I mean, anything.
Don't you like painting?
I don't know.
I've gotten so used to wallpaper.
But it's still much easier driving over here than in England.
In England, they drive on the left.
Boy, those English sure have a lot of guts.
No, it's the law.
- Haven't you ever been to England?
- Oh, no.
The sea makes me seasick and I'm afraid of flying.
I mean, not really flying,
I'm afraid of the "no smoking" sign.
- But maybe I can do it now, huh?
- I'm sure.
Wouldn't you like a quick drink?
You have time.
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
I don't think so.
I'm supposed to be at the Americana at...
- A short one.
- Fine.
And what are you studying?
Well, let's see.
Oh, I'm taking domestic science at Laura Bates Greeley and budget-making at Mary Hope Curtis and child care at the Sarah Plaut
Gromberg Clinic, you know, here at the medical school.
And 20 lectures on planned parenthood, ten on how to and ten on how not to.
What size family do you come from?
Well, my father's pretty fat, but the rest of us is...
Oh, you mean how many brothers and sisters.
None.
I had this great stepbrother for a while, but it didn't last very long.
I mean, there was, you know, trouble in the front office.
You lived with your mother?
Yeah. In Mahwah, New Jersey.
- Where?
- Mahwah. M-A-H-W-A-H.
That's where...
That's where she lives.
- Fascinating.
- It is?
- Another drink?
- Oh, no, no, no. Thank you, really.
- I've gotta run.
- A short one.
Oh, fine.
- Muriel, have you seen Daisy?
- I thought she was with you.
Oh, I goofed. Chemical Foods called this afternoon and postponed and I forgot to call and tell her.
- Warren.
- Daisy, Daisy, I'm sorry.
It was called off and I forgot to tell you.
- Did you wait too long?
- Oh, no.
- But you got something to eat?
- Yeah.
- Will you forgive me?
- Sure.
- Thattagirl.
- I forgot too.
- What?
- I didn't go, you know, to the Americana.
I forgot too.
- You didn't go?
- No.
Isn't that a funny coincidence?
Yes, it certainly is. It's amazing.
You didn't go either.
You... Didn't you really?
No, I didn't. And I'm not just saying that to make you feel good.
Oh, I believe you. I believe you.
It's just that, well,
Daisy, this was an important night, and what the hell were you doing?
What's the matter, Warren?
Everything worked out fine.
- Aren't you happy?
- Yeah, I'm very happy.
- Why don't you smile?
- I am.
I like your smile, Warren. Super.
See you tomorrow.
Look...
- Daisy...
- Good night, Warren.
Now, that's what I call a man.
What are you gonna do about Warren?
That's the first time in my life
I felt like the opposite sex.
What are you gonna do about Warren?
I wonder if he'll ask me out tomorrow night.
What are you gonna do about Warren?
What am I gonna do about Warren?
Oh, Warren doesn't care.
- Warren cares.
- Warren cares.
But I don't care.
You have to care because you're engaged to him.
You don't have to care about him because how do you know he cares about you?
Then what are you gonna do?
What'd you say?
When you know there's someone
Loving you
And you know there's someone
You love too
And they're not the same
What do you do?
Go to sleep, girl
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
Close your eyes
And hide from every care
When you wake up
They may not be there
But tell me, how can I sleep?
Tell me who could
When you see your whole life
Tangled up good?
I could drink
I could weep
Oh, but how can I sleep?
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
And when you and someone
Have a date
Which you made
When you were thinking straight
And when you and someone
Stay out late
It was bad to
But I had to
When they're not the same
Who gets the gate?
This is not the way to find a mate
Go to sleep, girl
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
Go to sleep, girl
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
Comes the dawn
I may not feel the same
Comes the dawn
He may not know your name
In the sunlight
Who can see a flame?
But tell me, how can I sleep?
Look what I've done
Mess around with two men
Soon you have none
As you sow, so you reap
Which is why I can't sleep
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
Go to...
How do you happen to be in command of all this useless knowledge?
Because I'm interested in extrasensory perception, ESP.
What does it have to do with ESP?
Because if a case such as this is not the memory of a past life, then somehow...
...knowledge is being acquired by a sense other than the five that we know about. Ergo, extrasensory.
And, my boy, that's the solution we'd better root for.
Because if reincarnation is ever proven, do you know who will be the hardest hit?
The sweethearts of Sigmund Freud.
Did you ever look up Pelham and
Company or any of those ships?
This is a fantasy, Conrad.
To 600 million Muhammadans, so is Christmas.
- Yes?
- Daisy Gamble is here, doctor.
May I meet her?
Ask her to come in.
Did you ever try to hypnotize her by telepathy?
Oh, for God's sake, Conrad.
Telepathy.
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.
I brought you these.
Miss Gamble, may I present
Dr Fuller.
Oh, hello.
How do you do, Miss Gamble?
I was just leaving.
They're geraniums.
Any minute now.
Miss Gamble says that she can make flowers grow faster.
Faster than what, Miss Gamble?
Well, you know, faster.
What I mean, my friend Muriel and I, we plant our seeds on the same day, and, I don't know, my flowers come charging out of the pot as if the police were after them, and poor Muriel...
Do you ever talk to your flowers,
Miss Gamble?
Talk to them?
What do you think I am, crazy?
Do you?
- You don't think I should?
- Yes, I do, and don't let anyone stop you, either.
Well, goodbye, Miss Gamble.
Oh, Marc, I advise you to check those names.
I brought these for your window.
- You know, sill?
- Thank you.
Let's put them over here.
Doctor, were you thinking about me around 4:00 this morning?
I was asleep then, Miss Gamble.
Why?
So was I, but something woke me up.
I could've sworn it was you.
Really?
Those look just great there.
Gotta bring you some more.
Miss Gamble.
I wonder if I could hypnotize you by...
...telepathy.
What would I have to do?
Just sit here...
...perfectly still, and empty your mind of all thought.
And I'll stand over here, and at a certain moment,
I'll begin hypnotizing you in my mind.
Do you understand?
Sure, I understand.
It's such a ridiculous...
Very good, Miss Gamble.
And very irritating.
About Melinda Tentrees, you told me that your husband Robert deserted you.
Please. Not when I'm about to make an entrance.
Number four.
Black.
Melinda, my dear.
What a questionable surprise.
Do sit down, if you insist.
Thank you.
It's quite fascinating. I cannot lose.
If I win, I win.
If I lose, you'll be in agony, and I win.
Number ten. Black.
Well, you have lost.
And I am hardly writhing on the floor.
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
And unlike you,
I know what it is to be poor.
All you have ever been is without funds.
You're so smug about your humble beginnings, aren't you? You bore me.
Rien ne va plus.
That is not true.
You may resent me, Robert.
But you are not bored.
Number 19.
Red.
Play 24.
I've lost everything, what?
- Everything.
- Splendid.
I don't wish to be rich,
I don't wish to be knighted and I don't wish to be married.
You lie.
Number 24. Black.
Yes. I lie.
Do you enjoy lying?
To you and with you.
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
Play 36.
Rien ne va plus.
Must you have everything?
Man cannot live by bed alone.
Number 36. Red.
Good Lord, what does she see in him?
That gigolo.
What a strange creature woman is.
Does kindness, generosity and devotion fill her with kindness, generosity and devotion?
But give her a good-for-nothing rat who pinches her money and every girl in town, and she'll turn into an angel of love.
Oh, God, why didn't you make woman first, when you were fresh?
"Robert: Must you have everything?
Melinda: Man cannot live by bed alone."
"Doctor: Now may we go on?
Patient: I am quite tired.
Doctor: I can see you are.
You may sleep until..."
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
This is the case to date.
Now I want to see by a show of hands how many of you think it's a psychological fantasy?
Everybody.
There's no question about it.
No argument.
And no evidence.
Only prejudice.
In my opinion, this case merits further investigation.
And I intend to go on searching the patient's life and mind for a clue.
In addition, the information about
England must also be checked.
If any of you have the time or interest,
I would welcome your help.
And the expected high for today will be 72 degrees.
The time is now 16 minutes past 8.
On the local front, a nasty case of mysticism has struck the Stuyvesant Medical School.
Yesterday Dr Marc Chabot, professor of psychiatry, let it be known that he was investigating a possible case of reincarnation.
And by dawn, the school was surrounded.
Countless students, seeking a fresh cause for rebellion, congregated in front of the medical school demanding academic freedom.
An emergency meeting of the Stuyvesant board of directors was called for this morning.
I want those junkies out of the yard.
We'll get them out, Brad.
Marc, we were told that yesterday in your lecture hall, you read aloud a case history of one of your current patients, and in the discussions that followed, you indicated that one possible explanation...
You'll have to forgive me, Marc, but this is what we heard.
One possible explanation could be reincarnation.
Now, what actually happened, Marc?
That's what happened.
What the hell did you say that for?
- Because it could be.
- It could be.
But the point is it isn't.
The stink's coming right through the walls.
We know, Brad.
Get them out of here before they start setting themselves on fire.
We will, Brad!
This medical school is a damn sick little guy.
The only way you're gonna be able to get rid of the poison is surgery.
We've gotta go deep with that scalpel.
I'm presiding here, Crock.
You might try to remember how difficult it is to get good college presidents these days.
Gentlemen, I think we can cut through all of this.
Marc, in a privately sponsored school, such as Stuyvesant, academic freedom means that if you disagree with the administration, you're free to go to another academy.
That's a choice that you're going to have to make.
At 10:00 tomorrow morning,
I want you to bring into my office either a letter denying emphatically that your remarks had any mystic implications or a letter of resignation.
Is that clear?
Mason, I don't see how you could ask me to do anything else.
We have got to stop this kind of publicity.
Good day, gentlemen.
And it was never my intention to suggest reincarnation as a possible solution to this case.
I only wanted my students to learn that all possibilities must always...
Are you all right, doctor?
Yes, come in, come in.
All those things they said about you in the paper, I was so worried.
- Come in.
- I mean, how is
- your mental health, doctor?
- It's fine, thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.
Boy, what a layout.
Gee, this is really something.
Who's that?
The woman who lives here.
- Oh, I thought you lived here.
- I do.
Where is she now?
Away with her husband.
- Are they French too?
- No. No.
They gave me their apartment for the summer.
You sure you're all right?
Yes.
Doctor, how long has this stuff been going on?
Quite a while.
Does anybody besides you know who the thing is happening to?
- I mean, you know, who the nut is?
- No.
And no one ever will.
Do most people think it was a man or a woman?
Yes, most people think it was a man or a woman.
Daisy, would you mind if we skipped your session tonight?
That's all right.
But we can still have dinner if you like.
Oh, great! And will you let me pick out where?
Of course.
Nobody ever asks me where
I wanna go except you.
I mean, everybody usually, you know, always tells me.
I'm kind of a...
You know, a go-alonger.
I mean, people say "Come along," and I go along.
Downstairs where I live, they've got this restaurant called
Enrico and Bernardi's.
But, well, I mean, does anybody ever say:
"Daisy, do you wanna go to Enrico and Bernardi's?"
No. No, they say:
"Daisy, we are going to Enrico and Bernardi's.
You want to come along?"
So I go along.
I don't even like
Enrico and Bernardi's.
They've got absolutely rotten food.
And the pizza, well, I have lost more temporary fillings...
Hello.
Oh, it's you.
How are you tonight?
I am accused of treason.
And tomorrow I shall be ordered to stand trial.
Does Robert know?
I sent him a message two hours ago.
Where is he?
He should be home soon.
Could this be the moment he deserted you?
Deserted me?
Robert has not deserted me, and he never will.
You ought to know.
Why?
Do you think I can see into the future?
Yes.
I can about certain things.
But never, never about myself.
Oh, I am pleased you came tonight.
An hour ago I was ready to leap from the bridge.
What's the matter?
Melinda, I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
We shan't be together ever again?
No.
That's dreadful.
I shall miss you.
I shall miss you too.
You have brought something into my life I never knew existed.
What's that?
Mystery.
How odd.
You have brought clarity into mine.
What will I ever do without you?
- You have Robert.
- I know.
Whom you love.
I know.
But he isn't you.
How could I be
This at ease with him?
Pour out my heart
As I please with him?
He isn't you
He isn't you
When will I feel
So in bloom again?
When will a voice
Warm the room again?
He isn't you
He isn't you
Memories may fade
In the shadows behind me
But there'll be the dream
That will always remind me
A dream
That I'll be forever
Comparing him to
So love me, he may
Even die for me
Sweep every cloud
From the sky for me
He may be king
But he'll never
Be you
But why must you turn back into a caterpillar, Melinda?
How did you ever become this little nothing of a creature?
Oh, sometimes I think if I hear another "I mean,"
I will tighten my tie until I strangle.
Marc, sit down.
Mason, you asked me yesterday to prepare a statement.
Forgive me, Marc. Could we table that for a moment?
- Why?
- Just bear with me.
Marc, you know this building is called Stratton Hall.
Do you know who
Cleo Stratton is?
The man who owns that enormous yacht in the river?
He lives on it.
He's now 80.
During the past 25 years he's had diabetes, tuberculosis, cataracts, half dozen assorted tumours, ulcers, gallstones and water on the knee, all of which the doctors here at Stuyvesant have cured.
Coincidentally, during this same period, he has given the school over $20 million, including his Social Security and Medicare checks.
Mr Stratton heard about our conversation yesterday and called me early this morning to inform me he was definitely in favour of your being allowed to continue with your case.
With the four of us against it, it made the final vote ten for you and none opposed.
He not only wants you to continue with your case, but he wants me to organize a permanent department for research into reincarnation.
Good Lord.
Yes, I believe he is.
But Mr Stratton wants proof.
It occurred to him that if it's possible to identify one's previous incarnations, it might also be possible to determine one's future ones, in which case Mr Stratton could leave his money to himself.
You mean, if he can't take it with him, he'll come back and get it?
Yes.
Well, what do you think, Marc?
Well, what do you expect?
It's the chance of a lifetime, of all my lifetimes.
Thank you.
I will so inform him.
You're...
You're not happy about it, are you, Mason?
No, I'm not happy.
I think reincarnation is appalling.
It kills ambition, perpetuates human misery and propagates false hopes.
And is obviously a pack of lies.
Then how can you accept his proposition?
I may be wrong.
Dr Chabot's office.
Oh, yes. Yes, doctor, she's here.
One moment, please.
The doctor will be a little late.
Can you wait?
Yes, she can.
Oh, then I can go home now?
Thank you, doctor. Good night.
You don't mind being alone, do you?
He won't be long.
Oh, no, don't worry about me.
I wanna listen to the news, you know, about him, if there is any.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm Daisy Gamble.
Maybe I was called something else once, but the only name I...
Take your time.
I mean, my name has always...
My name is...
My name is Melinda.
Melinda Winifred Waine Tentrees.
And I am appalled and stunned at this outrageous inquisition.
You may sleep until I count to three and snap my fingers, and then you will awake and remember nothing about Melinda.
Now, sleep.
But why must you turn back into a caterpillar, Melinda?
How did you ever become this little nothing of a creature?
Oh, sometimes I think if I hear another "I mean,"
I will tighten my tie until I strangle.
Daisy Gamble, somewhere in your mind is the key to all this, and I intend to find it, if I have to squeeze out of you every moment of your whole boring little...
I don't know why
They redesigned me
He likes the way
He used to find me
He likes the girl
I left behind me
I mean, he...
I mean, me...
What did I have
That I don't have?
What did he like
That I lost track of?
What did I do
That I don't do
The way I did before?
What isn't there
That once was there?
What have I got
A great big lack of?
Something in me then
He could see then
Beckons to him no more
I'm just a victim of time
Obsolete in my prime
Out-of-date and outclassed
By my past
What did he love
That there's none of?
What did I lose
The sweet, warm knack of?
Wouldn't I be
The late, great me
If I knew how?
What did I have
I don't
Have now?
I thought he kind of liked me.
And all the time he was thinking of someone else.
Me.
Those questions.
He wasn't interested in me.
He was interested in me.
Oh, God.
Why did I have to come along?
I mean, what is so special about an English accent?
Cheerio.
Tallyho, doctor.
Yes, she gave me the jolly message.
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
After all, what is time?
If you miss me in this life, you can catch me in the next, can't one?
Eh, what?
Well, kippered herring!
What did I have that I don't have?
What do I need a big supply of?
What was the trick I did
Particularly well before?
What did he see that's gone in me?
What did I use that now I'm shy of?
Why is the sequel never the equal?
Why is there no encore?
Where can I go to repair
All the wear and the tear
Till I'm once again the previous me?
What did he like that I am not like?
What was the charm
That I've run dry of?
What would I give
If my old know-how
Still knew how?
Oh, what did I know?
Tell me, where did it go?
What, oh, what did I have
I don't
Have
Now?
Daisy!
What did you mean, "the next life"?
What were you talking about?
I've been trying to find you since 6:00.
- Where did you go?
- To Max's Hardware Store.
- Where?
- Max's Hardware Store!
My watering can fell off the roof.
But...? But where have you been since then?
You knew we were supposed to work.
I had...
Oh, you wanted to do some researching tonight?
- You know, with me?
- Of course.
Casually glance at some old English stuff together?
- We might. It's possible.
- And maybe top off the evening with a little hypnotism?
Sort of one little trance before nighty-night?
- It's for your good, Daisy.
- Get off my roof!
- What?
- I said, get off my roof!
- What's the matter?
- Get this straight, Chabot.
Your courting days are over.
I am through being a go-between for you and your dream girl.
You're not gonna go on using my head for a motel!
Oh, my God. This is disastrous.
Oh, no.
Now that you know who you are, you can influence every memory.
You're no longer reliable.
How did you find out? Who told you?
- I played a tape, and all I can say...
- Which tape?
- How do I know?! All I can say is...
- What was it about?
It was in a foreign language!
All I can say is...
- Did you tell anyone?
- And get put in a circus? No.
All I can say is... Oh, rats,
I don't even remember anymore.
Oh, yeah, yeah. All I can say is, if you tell anybody it's me, I'll sue.
Do you hear me? I'll sue!
There may still be a chance.
Daisy...
The first finger that touches me,
I cut off.
Daisy, I insist you stop this neurotic behaviour at once.
Neurotic?!
You get the hots over somebody you're not even sure was anybody, you call me neurotic?!
Physician, heal thyself!
Daisy. Daisy, Daisy, because
I didn't tell you what I was doing, you may feel betrayed and hurt.
But a case like yours happens once in a million years.
And, Daisy, we have a breathtaking adventure in front of us.
By the time we finish, you may find yourself not only not an abnormal girl, but one of the few genuinely normal people on Earth.
Get off my roof!
I will not get off your roof until I bring you to your senses.
Any other girl would be proud to be part of this adventure.
Great. If you want to experiment, go pick on someone else.
I can't, Daisy. I can't.
Daisy, I need you.
You bet your Aunt Susie you need me.
And not for the noble cause of science, either.
- You wanna see Melinda.
- Melinda's beside the point.
- You got the hots for Melinda!
- I am not your business!
That's right, doctor.
You're not.
And I'm not yours either.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a lot of things to do.
I gotta... I gotta spend more time with Warren.
I gotta plan my life with Chemical Foods.
And I need my roof!
So if you don't mind, one, two, three, beat it!
Your roof?
Very well, keep your roof.
It's as close to heaven as you'll ever get.
Melinda's soul inside of you?
God, what a housing shortage.
Damn you, Daisy,
I can't let you free. I can't.
Not with all the buried treasure inside you.
- Help!
- You'll see me again.
You can count on that.
Again and again.
You have an appointment tomorrow at 6. Be there!
Clip, clip!
Rats.
Oh, no, you don't,
Dr Marc Chabot.
You are not going to hypnotize me into coming back.
Fourscore and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition...
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow.
Everywhere that Mary went, her lamb was sure to...
Hey, what in the name of...?
What the hell do you mean, "shh"?
Jerk.
Fourscore and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon...
- Daisy!
- A new nation...
- Daisy, what are you doing?
- Liberty and dedicated to...
Daisy, what's happened to you?!
I left you a while ago, you were quiet.
Daisy, pay attention!
What are you doing?!
Daisy, what in heaven...?
That's rude.
That is very rude, and I'm shocked.
That, Daisy, is not necessary.
I like you the way you are.
Daisy! Listen to me!
Oh, Warren!
This is not behaving in a company way.
Daisy, will you...
For Pete's sake, look out!
Marc!
Yes, Conrad.
Marc, get out the champagne.
Shake out the confetti.
- What's the matter with you?
- I solved your case, that's all.
Will you ever forgive me?
The place to look for spooks, my dear doctor, is not in a medical library or in Burke's Peerage, but in a spook book.
This is an encyclopaedia of 19th-century psychics.
- May I read aloud?
- Yes, go on.
"Tentrees, Melinda. Clairvoyant.
Dates, 1787-1815.
Married to Sir Robert Tentrees.
In celebrated case,
Melinda Tentrees found guilty of conspiring with enemies of the crown and was executed one year after sentencing."
How does that grab you?
What about her husband?
Oh, yeah, well, that's here.
That's here.
"Melinda Tentrees claimed all her information resulted from psychic powers, but her husband failed to appear at her trial.
His evidence might have saved her."
Well, there it is.
And may I add that I find your gratitude absolutely underwhelming.
Then she is not an illusion.
She lived.
Conrad, I have the feeling
I've known that girl before.
I've got to find out if it's true.
Hi, fella.
- Hi.
- You seen Daisy?
- No.
- That's good.
Is something the matter?
No, no, no, it's just that we have a date tonight with the personnel director of Chemical Foods at 6:00 at the Americana and his wife.
I just wanna make sure she doesn't forget it again.
I wouldn't worry about that now.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't worry about it now because it's me.
- Wait till you have to get a job.
- I'm not going to.
Oh, really?
Oh, how you gonna arrange that?
I'm rich.
Oh, boy.
Oh, that's depressing.
You know, it's funny you never know where Daisy is.
Why?
Well, you're engaged to her.
Don't you ever ask her what she does?
No.
- You're incredible.
- Top 2 percent.
Listen, how come I never see you with any medical books?
I mean, are you really going to school, or did you buy the teacher?
I haven't started yet.
Then why are you hanging around here?
- Actually, I came to see Daisy.
- Why?
She wrote me that she was gonna be married and I wanted to see if she was happy.
Too bad.
Why, you got a better idea?
Yes.
Me.
You?
That's incest!
- We're only related by marriage.
- Well, what other way is there?
- Morning.
- Morning.
Honey, you look kind of tired.
You ought to go back to bed.
I mean, you gotta be in top form tonight.
Daisy, do you remember everything we talked about?
- Yeah.
- All right, now, listen, Daisy, for God's sake, don't let on that you know that screwball hypnotist.
Sweet mother India, if they ever found out about that...
Oh, hey, Daisy, I got a great piece of news for you. You ready?
You don't have to worry about the cigarettes.
I found out Mrs Unkstadder is a chain-smoker.
Isn't that a hot one, huh?
Oh, that is...
That... That is really a hot one.
Oh, Warren, that...
That is really a riot.
Isn't that a hot riot, Tad?
Well...
...l've really got a hot one for you too, Warren.
I'm that patient of Dr Chabot's.
I'm Melinda.
I'm not hearing this.
And do you know why my flowers get so tall?
Because I talk to them.
Every morning I come up here and I read them Walter Lippmann.
You talk to them?
And do you know what else?
I can tell when the phone's gonna ring.
Walter Lippmann?
Watch.
Tell him I'm out!
Hello? She's out.
Now, Warren, what time do we meet tonight, huh? Six o'clock?
Oh, great. I just can't wait for you to see my new dress.
Oh, it is not too low, it is not too short.
It is transparent!
- But, Daisy, what...?
- I can't, Warren!
- I just can't!
- But, Daisy...
Oh, Warren!
Get off my roof.
I've been calling for eight days, and for eight days
I've been told Miss Gamble is out.
When has she been in?
If she's not been in, then she's not out. She's away.
Now, which is it?
Is she out or is she away?
And if she's away, when did...?
Hello. Hello!
If you don't mind my saying so, doctor, why are you so interested in coming back?
You don't seem to be having that good a time.
Thank you, Mrs Hatch.
You've done the impossible.
You've given my depression a depression.
You're out there somewhere,
Daisy Gamble.
And you can hear me.
So listen!
Hear my voice
Where you are
Take the train
Steal a car
Hop a freight
Grab a star
Come back to me
Catch a plane
Catch a breeze
On your hands
On your knees
Swim or fly
Only, please
Come back to me
On a mule
In a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel, wringing wet
I don't care
This is where
You should be
From the hills
From the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just
Come back to me
Making a soufflé requires alertness and cunning and patience.
And above all, stamina.
Beat, beat, beat.
Blast your hide
Hear me call
Must I fight city hall?
Here and now
Damn it all
Come back to me
What on earth must I do?
Scream and yell till I'm blue?
Curse your soul
When will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon?
Or the corner saloon
And to rack and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in hell
Can you be?
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch
Evermore
In a Rolls or a van
Wrapped in mink or saran
Any way that you can
Come back to me
Damn you, Daisy Gamble, where are you?
Why can't you pick up a phone?
Hear my voice
Through the din
Feel the waves
On your skin
Like a call from within
Come back to me
Leave behind all you own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone
Come back to me
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
Ride a rail
Come by mail
COD
Par avion
Par bateau
Dans une vieille
Deux chevaux
Come by steam
Come by gas
Come for free
On a pass
Under drugs
Under glass
Come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your soufflé unsouffléd
Come back to me
Come by sail
Come by freight
In a box or a crate
With your head on a plate
I don't care
This is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk
Shut up!
On a horse or a drunk
In a Ford or a funk
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back...
Daisy!
Will you stop bothering me!
- Daisy, l...
- Day after day, night after night, in the bathtub, on the roof, awake or asleep.
What is this, extrasensory torture?
I'd go to the police, but with a story like this, they'd have locked me up!
What do you want out of me?
Never mind, I know what you want, and you can't have it because I haven't got it.
Even if I did, you wouldn't get it.
- What are you talking about?
- What you're thinking about, Melinda.
My name never was Melinda Tentrees.
Now, is that clear?
- How do you know?
- Because I know.
- How?
- Well, well, how could it be?
- I'm not like Melinda Tentrees.
- How do you know what she's like?
I don't, but you do, and you like what she's like.
You don't like what I'm like, so I know we're not alike.
I know what I'm like, and I don't like it either.
Because I'm like nothing and like nobody, and nothing or nobody can change me.
I'm stuck as I am.
Weak, a go-alonger, no character!
- You have character to stop smoking.
- That's a dirty lie!
I didn't stop smoking, you made my subconscious stop wanting to.
And I went along, just like I always do.
Now, will you please leave me alone!
Will you please sit down!
Now, you listen to me!
As little as you know about Melinda, it's gigantic compared to what you know about Daisy Gamble.
You think you're nothing and you walk around looking out over the world like Jupiter on Mount Olympus.
Imagine having eyes that can see the lost article of a friend or someone about to phone you or to be filled with a kind of love that pulls flowers from the ground.
And if that were not enough, you either have a heart so deep it spans the ages or a mind that's filled with the total memory of life.
Why, Daisy...
...you're a bloody miracle.
Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do?
And who would ever guess
What powers you possess?
And who would not be stunned
To see you prove
There's more to us
Than surgeons can remove?
So much more than we ever knew
So much more were we born to do
Should you draw back the curtain?
This, I am certain
You'll be impressed
With you
On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you'll see
Who you are
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You feel a part of
Every mountain, sea and shore
You can hear from far and near
A world you've never heard before
And on a clear day
On that clear day
You can see forever
And ever
And ever
And evermore
Gee.
Gee.
Daisy, I must hypnotize you
- one more time.
- No!
Not to see Melinda, I swear it.
Now that you know, it would probably be distorted.
It's for another reason.
I ask you as a favour.
One last time.
Just hope I haven't forgotten how...
- Daisy, can you hear me?
- Yes.
Open your eyes.
I want you to concentrate very, very hard.
You have told me about your life as Melinda.
Do you remember any other previous lifetimes?
Oh, sure.
How many?
Let's see.
One, two, three, four.
Five.
Six.
Seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.
Thirteen.
- Fourteen...
- That's enough, Daisy.
In all those lifetimes, do you ever remember...
...meeting me?
Yes.
Did we know each other well?
We were married.
Happily married?
It was...
...beyond anything.
What were our names?
Laura and John Caswell.
Laura and John Caswell.
Where did we live?
It's funny.
We lived in Virginia.
I can...
I can see us, but l...
I can't see all around us.
What year was it?
- I think I see...
- You don't have to go further.
No more questions.
Sleep until I count to three and snap my fingers.
Then you will awaken and you won't remember what you told me.
One, two, three.
Fine.
Thank you, Daisy.
When are you getting married?
Warren and I have severed our relationship.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I thought I'd go up on the roof for a while and sit around with Tad.
You know, my ex-stepbrother.
I think that's a good idea.
- What about you?
- Well, you know, I'm married.
Oh, really?
Yes, but we're separated.
Oh, really?
I spoke to her and somehow
I think it will be all right now.
Oh, really.
She says I've changed.
Have you?
Yes. Thanks to you.
I used to be in love with answers, but since I have known you,
I'm just as fond of the questions.
I think the answers make you wise, but the questions make you human.
You got that from me?
Yes, I did.
Well,
I'm glad you got something.
It's only fair.
I don't smoke anymore.
Well...
Goodbye, doctor.
Goodbye, Daisy.
Bye.
Daisy, have you...?
Have you ever been to Virginia?
No.
Have you?
No.
Daisy.
You won't forget what I told you?
On...
...a clear day...
Rise and look around you
And you'll see
Who you are
Well...
So long, doctor.
See you later.
On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You'll feel part of
Every mountain, sea and shore
You can hear from far and near
A world you never
Never heard before
And on a clear day
On that clear day
You can see forever
And ever and ever
And evermore
BOYS [SINGING]:
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on Earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all the nations...
There will be no peace on Earth with all that blooming noise going on.
- Here you are, boys.
BOYS [IN UNISON]: Thanks, guv'nor.
BOY 1:
Come on.
[CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]
BOY 2: All right, come on, hurry up.
BOY 3: All right, all right.

Come on, this house here.

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on Earth and mercy mild

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Infernal, horrible caterwauling.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Why can't they leave a man in peace?
Get on with your work, Cratchit.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to...
BOYS: Merry Christmas.
- Get away from me, you scavengers.
Blimey. Who's he?
That's Father Christmas.
A plague on Father Christmas.
And he sends his best to you too, guv'nor.
[BOYS LAUGHING]
BOY 4: Regards, Father Christmas.
- Humbug.
Insolent young ruffians.
Coming here with their Christmas nonsense.
Beware, Cratchit.
You have a dangerous sense of humor.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hell fire and damnation.
Don't they know that I'm trying to run a business here?
Uncle Ebenezer,
I cannot tell you what a joy it is to see your happy, smiling face.
- Hmm, it's you.
- A Merry Christmas, Uncle Ebenezer.
God save you.
God save me from Christmas.
It's a lot of humbug.
Christmas a humbug? Come now,
I'm sure you don't mean that.
And I'm sure that I do mean that.
Merry Christmas indeed.
What reason have you got to be merry? You're poor enough.
What reason have you got to be miserable? You're rich enough.
There is no such thing as rich enough.
Only poor enough.
Don't be so dismal, Uncle Ebenezer.
What else can I be when I live in a world full of fools babbling Merry Christmas at one another?
What's Christmas but a time for finding yourself a year older and not a day richer?
There's nothing merry in that.
If I could work my will, nephew, every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
Oh, God forbid, uncle.
You keep Christmas in your way and let me keep it in mine.
But you don't keep it.
Then let me... Get off my ledger.
You'll ruin my binding.
Then let me leave it alone, sir.
And be good enough to leave me alone during business hours.
Seven o'clock on Christmas eve?
That's not business hours.
That's drudgery for the sake of it.
And an insult to all men of good will.
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you, Bob Cratchit.
Another word from you, Cratchit, and you will celebrate Christmas by losing your position.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge.
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
I wonder you don't go into politics.
You're fool enough.
[CHUCKLES]
Come now.
Don't be angry.
Dine with me wife and me tomorrow.
As though you hadn't got enough problems, you went and got yourself married.
Now why in God's name did you ever do that?
Because I fell in love with the lady.
If there's one thing in the world more nauseating than a Merry Christmas, it's the hypocrisy of a happy marriage with some idiot lovesick female.
Good afternoon, sir.
My offer stands.
You are always welcome, uncle.
Just like Christmas itself.
I said good afternoon.
Merry Christmas, uncle.
You too, Bob Cratchit. And your family.
Thank you, sir.
And to your good lady.
Oh, and uncle, happy New Year.
Good afternoon.
[CLOCK CHIMING]
Excuse me, sir.
But, well, it's 7:00, sir.
Correct, Cratchit.
Well, I don't wish to be impertinent,
Mr. Scrooge, but, uh, would it be too much trouble for me to have my, uh, wages, sir?
The trouble with you, Cratchit, is that all you think of is pleasure.
Pleasure and squandering money.
You'll, uh...
You'll be wanting the whole day off tomorrow, I suppose.
- If it's convenient, sir.
- No, sir.
It is not convenient.
And it is not fair.
Yet if I stopped your wages for it, you'd think yourself ill-used no doubt.
And yet you don't think me ill used when I pay a day's wages for no work.
Well, it is Christmas day,
Mr. Scrooge.
And it is only once a year, sir.
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December.
I don't pay good money for you to be forever on holiday.
I appreciate your kindness,
Mr. Scrooge.
That's my weakness.
I'm a martyr to my own generosity.
I give you one Christmas day off and you expect them all.
Very well, take the day.
Thank you, sir.
But be here all the earlier the next morning.
Yes, sir. I will, sir.
Thank you very much.
Oh, and, uh, Merry Christmas,
Mr. Scrooge.
Be gone from here and take your infernal Merry Christmas with you.
I beg your pardon, sir.
No offense, sir.
There's another one.
Fifteen shillings a week.
A wife and five children.
Still talks of a Merry Christmas.
[MERCHANT SHOUTING
AND CROWD MURMURING]
Boo. Kathy, my dear.
Tim. Oh.
Oh, you're both frozen.
I'm sorry I'm late.
But Mr. Scrooge and I had a lot of last-minute business to attend to.
Well, my loves, which one do you like best, eh?
I like that dolly in the corner.
I like all of them.
Ha, ha. Good boy.
And why not one in particular?
Well, you said
I can't have none of them, so I might as well like them all.
Tim, you are a philosopher and a gentleman.
And I've got 15 shillings in my pocket.
BOTH:
Fifteen shillings?
Fifteen shillings.
Which says that the Cratchit family are gonna have as good a Christmas as the lord mayor of London himself.
Oh, I do like that dolly in the corner.
[SINGING] Christmas children
Peep into Christmas windows
See a world as pretty as a dream
Christmas trees and toys
Christmas hopes and joys
Christmas puddings
Rich with Christmas cream
[LAUGHING]
Christmas presents shine
In the Christmas windows
Christmas boxes
Tied with pretty bows
Wonder what's inside
What delights they hide
But 'til Christmas morning
No one knows
You with five children, Bob.
Five for a shilling.
Thank you, John.
[SINGING]
Won't it be exciting if it snows?
I suppose that children everywhere
Will say a Christmas prayer
'Til Santa brings
Their Christmas things
There, my loves. I've bought you the finest bird in the shop.
Well, for one and ten pence ha' penny.
[SINGING] Christmas children
Live in a Christmas daydream
Waiting for the magic to unfold
Wondrous things to eat
Every Christmas treat
Rich or not
The Christmas pot of gold
Hypnotizes children young and old
[MERCHANT SHOUTING
INDISTINCTLY]
Quite right, Mr. Cratchit.
With your lot to feed, apples at six a penny are the best bet.
I'd rather have the dolly in the corner.
I'd rather have the oranges.
And 1846 is the best vintage in 20 years.
At that price it should be.
- Your change, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Bissett.
- And a happy Christmas to you.
BISSETT: Happy Christmas to you, sir.
This will make the finest quality punch,
Mr. C.
And only tuppence a pint.
Christmas punch, it's a Cratchit specialty.
[KIDS LAUGH]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Four pence for a Christmas pudding.
Scandalous.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
JOHN: It's Papa.
- Where is he?
Here we are, my loves.
Look what we've brought for you.
And about time too, Bob Cratchit.
We were beginning to think you'd all gone away for Christmas.
[SINGING] Christmas children
Hunger for Christmas morning
Thank you.
Christmas day's a wonder to behold
Young ones' dreams come true
Not so young ones too
I believe that story we've been told
You're not the only ones who have been busy.
Come and see what we've been up to.
Christmas is for children
Young and old
MAN 1: Uh, good evening.
MAN 2: Good evening, sir.
Have we the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?
It's no pleasure to me, sir, to be addressed by either of you.
And Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years.
Seven years ago this very night he died.
We've no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner.
[MAN 1 CHUCKLES]
Uh, Mr. Scrooge.
Uh, sir, at this festive season of the year, sir, it is more than usually desirable, uh, that we should make some slight provision for the poor and the destitute.
Excellent. Then I suggest you do so.
You miss our point, sir.
The poor suffer greatly at the present time.
Many thousands are in want of common necessaries.
- Are there no prisons?
- Oh, indeed there are, sir.
That's something there's no shortage of.
And the workhouses, are they still in operation?
They are, sir.
I wish I could say they were not.
I'm very glad to hear it.
For a moment I was afraid that something had occurred to stop them in their useful purpose.
MAN 1:
Oh, but, sir.
A few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth.
We choose this time, sir, because it is a time when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices.
- What may we put you down for, sir?
- Nothing, sir.
MAN 1:
Ah, you wish to be anonymous.
I wish to be left alone, sir.
That is what I wish.
I don't make myself merry at Christmas and I cannot afford to make idle people merry.
I have been forced to support the establishments I have mentioned through taxation.
And God knows they cost more than they are worth.
Those who are badly off must go there.
Many would rather die than go there.
If they would rather die then they had better do it and decrease the surplus population.
Good night, gentlemen.
Humbug.
Poppycock. Balderdash. Bah.
[SINGING]
Scavengers and sycophants
And flatterers and fools
Pharisees and parasites
And hypocrites and ghouls
Calculating swindlers
Prevaricating frauds
Perpetrating evil
As they roam the earth in hordes.
Feeding on their fellow men
Reaping rich rewards
Contaminating everything they see
Corrupting honest men
Like me
[SHOUTING AND MURMURING]
I hate people
People are despicable creatures.
Loathsome, inexplicable creatures
Good for nothing, kickable creatures
I hate people
I abhor them
When I see the indolent classes
Sitting on their indolent arses
Gulping ale from indolent glasses
I hate people
I detest them
I deplore them
MERCHANT 1:
Knives, scissors or razors to grind.

Fools who have no money spend it
Get in debt then try to end it

Knowing I have cash to lend them

Softhearted me
Hard-working me
Clean-living, thrifty
And kind as can be
Situations like this
Are of interest to me
It's Mr. Scrooge.
MERCHANT 1:
Knives, scissors or razors to grind.
Two pounds, 5 shillings, ladies.
Due before Christmas.
That means today.
But you see, Mr. Scrooge, sir, we've been giving more credit than usual.
That's your business, madam.
Mine is to collect
2 pounds, 5 shillings now.
We sell things for children, sir.
At this time of the year people can't afford to pay.
Neither can I afford it, madam.
However, I will allow you an extra week's credit.
BOTH:
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.
Which will only cost you a further 12 shillings.
Twelve. Oh, but, Mr. Scrooge.
But we scarcely make that much in a week.
If you would prefer me to confiscate your store and its contents, which is my legal right, I will do so.
- But we will pay, sir.
- We will pay, sir.
You'll both sign this.
MERCHANT 1:
Knives, scissors or razors to grind.
- And you can give me a pair of these.
WOMAN 1: Certainly, Mr. Scrooge.
Oh, look, there's that lovable
Father Christmas again.
MOTHER: Merry Christmas, sir.
A penny for the baby, sir.
[SCROOGE GRUMBLES]
A penny for the baby, sir.
MERCHANT 2:
Lavender. Sweet lavender.
[SINGING]
I hate people
I loathe people
I despise and abominate people
Move over.
Life is full of cretinous wretches
Earning what
Their sweatiness fetches
Empty minds
Whose pettiness stretches
Further than I can see
Little wonder
I hate people
And I don't care if they hate me
[ALL BOOING]

Not now, Mr. Scrooge, please.
Two pounds 7 and 6, Miller.
And now is as good a time as any.
[IN SQUEAKY VOICE]
Stop it, stop it.
- But I'm performing.
- You're always performing.
- Where's my money?
- Tomorrow for sure, Mr. Scrooge.
After the Christmas morning show.
It's my best day of the year.
Tomorrow it will be 2 pounds 10 or I confiscate your puppets.
All right, Mr. Scrooge.
Two pounds 10.
[IN SQUEAKY VOICE]
Oh, what a pity. What a pity.
BOYS [SINGING]:
Father Christmas, Father Christmas
He's the meanest man
In the whole wide world
In the whole wide world
You can feel it
- He's a miser

SCROOGE:
Bah.
He's a stingy lout
Leave your stocking out
For your Christmas gift
And he'll steal it
It's a shame he's a villain
What a game for a villain
To play on Christmas day
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the...
Thank you, guv'nor.

He's a crafty one
Leave your door undone
He'll go in your house
And sell it

Here's your money, sir. Pray count it.
You waste breath, sir.
No one has ever short-changed me.

Lavender. Sweet lavender.
Sweet lavender.
Hot broth, Mr. Scrooge, a small token of Christmas esteem with the compliments of Tom Jenkins.
No.
And there'll be a free can of broth, sir, every night for the coming year in gratitude for your infinite kindness in giving me another two weeks to pay.
One week.
- Ten days?
- One week.
- One week.
- And put a lid on that stuff.
I'll take it home.

If you distrust Father Christmas
It's as well to know
That we told you so
Because I'm here to say
We should all send Father Christmas

MARLEY:

How now.
What do you want with me?
MARLEY:
Much.
Who are you?
In life, I was your partner,
Jacob Marley.
Can you sit down?
Of course I can sit down.
SCROOGE:
Do so then.
[SCROOGE SCOFFS]
You don't believe in me, do you?
No, I don't.
Why do you doubt the evidence of your own eyes?
Because I've had a slight stomach disorder.
It's undoubtedly affected my vision.
You're an hallucination.
Probably brought on by an undigested bit of beef or a blob of mustard, or a crumb of cheese or an old potato.
Yes, that's what you are.
You are an old potato.
You do not exist, Jacob Marley.
It's humbug I tell you.
It's a lot of...
[WAILS]
No! I beseech you!
Stop!
Now do you believe in me?
I believe in you absolutely.
But why do you walk the earth?
Why do you come to persecute me?
And what is that great chain you wear?
I wear the chain I forged in life.
I made it link by link and yard by yard while on Earth.
And now I'll never be rid of it any more than you will ever be rid of yours.
Mine?
It was as heavy and long as this seven Christmases ago.
It's a terrible ponderous chain you are making, Scrooge.
Tell me more, Marley, but speak comfort to me.
- I have none to give.
- None?
Comfort comes from other sources,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
And is given by other ministers than I to other kinds of men than you.
When I lived, my spirit, like yours, never walked beyond the narrow limits of our counting house.
But you were always a good man of business.
Mankind should be our business,
Ebenezer.
But we seldom attend to it, as you shall see.
Marley!
[SCROOGE WHIMPERING]
Marley. Marley.
[SINGING] See the phantoms
Filling the sky around you
They astound you I can tell
These inhabitants of hell
Poor wretches
Whom the hand of heaven ignores
Beware
Beware
Beware
Lest their dreadful fate be yours
It was a dream.
[CHUCKLES]
Yes, that's what it was. A dream.
It's not a dream, Ebenezer.
For pity's sake, Marley.
Leave me in peace.
It was for pity's sake I came here.
Pity for you.
I leave you with just the tiniest chance of escaping my fate.
You were always a good friend to me, Jacob. Thank you.
You will be visited by three ghosts.
I... I think I'd rather not.
The first will appear tonight when the bell tolls 1.
Couldn't I take them all at once, and get it over with, Jacob?
The second at 2:00.
And the third when the bell tolls 3.
- I must go now.
- Marley, wait.
I'm doomed to wander through the world in everlasting repentance.
Remember what has passed between us.
Farewell, Scrooge.
Three ghosts? Ha.
Three humbugs.

Who are you?
I am the spirit whose coming was foretold to you.

- Thank you.
May I enquire more precisely who or what you are?
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
- Long past?
- No, your past.
- What business brings you here?
- Your welfare.
To be woken by a ghost at 1:00 in the morning is hardly conducive to my welfare.
Your redemption, then.
Rise and walk with me.
Where are we going?
We are going to look at your childhood.

Sing a song of gladness and cheer
For the time of Christmas is here
Look around about you and see
What a world of wonder
This world can be
Sing a Christmas carol
Sing a Christmas carol
Sing a Christmas carol

Enjoy the beauty
All the joy and beauty
That a Merry Christmas
Can bring to you
Do you remember these children?
Of course. All of them.
London bridge is falling down
My fair lady
For the time of Christmas is here
Sing a song of sixpence
A pocket full of rye
Look around about you and see
Here we go round the mulberry bush
On a cold and frosty morning
Look, there's my little sister.
- Fran. Fran.
- Sing a Christmas carol
Fran!
Why doesn't she wave back?
She cannot see you.
These are but shadows of the things that have been.
That a Merry Christmas

I could never join in those Christmas parties.
The school is not quite empty, is it?
A solitary boy neglected by his family is left there still.
Poor boy.
I wish...
- What is it?
- Ugh, nothing, nothing.
What is it you wish?
There were some boys singing a Christmas carol outside my door last night.
I should have given them something, that's all.
Let us look at another Christmas.
Ebby. Dear, dear brother.
- I've come to bring you home.
- Home with you, Fran?
Father is so much kinder than he used to be.
He sent me in a coach to bring you home, Ebby.
We're to be together all Christmas long.
Go and fetch your things.
Always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered.
But she had a large heart.
She had. I'll not deny it.
She died a woman and I believe had children.

Why, it's old Fezziwig alive again.
I was his apprentice.
Yo-ho, Ebenezer. Yo-ho, Dick.
Hi-de-ho and chirrup.
No more work today, me boys.
Hi-de-hi, it's Christmas Eve, Dick.
It's Christmas, Ebenezer.
Now come on, clear everything away before a man can say Jack Robinson.
And make some room here before Mrs. Fezziwig and my daughters arrive with the punchbowl.
SCROOGE: My word,
I am a good-looking chap. Ha.
And strong too.

What a marvelous man.
What's so marvelous?
He's merely spent a few pounds of your mortal money, three or four perhaps.
What is that to be deserving of so much praise?
You don't understand.
He has the power to make us happy or unhappy, to make our work a pleasure or a burden.
It's nothing to do with money.

December the 25th

Isabel.
Fezziwig's daughter.
You were going to marry her, weren't you?
Yes.
[SINGING]
You, you were new to me
You, you were spring
You, you were true to me
You, you were everything

Is a thing you can't see
A thing you can't touch, I disagree

- Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.
Happiness is standing beside me
I can see him, he can see me
Happiness is whatever
You want it to be
Happiness is a high hill
Will I find it? Yes, I will
Happiness is a tall tree
Can I climb it?
Watch and see
They say happiness
Is the folly of fools
Pity poor me, one of the fools
Happiness is smiling upon me
Walking my way, sharing my day
Happiness is whatever
You want it to be
Happiness is a bright star
Are we happy? Yes, we are
Happiness is a clear sky
Give me wings and let me fly
Let me fly

For happiness
Is whatever you want it to be
SCROOGE [SINGING]:
You, you were good for me
You were my day
Did all you could for me
I let you go away
I did love her, you know.
- Did you?
- Oh, yes, I loved her.
Then why did you let her go?
I've never been quite sure.
Then let us go and see.
- Ebenezer?
- Yeah?
I've come to say goodbye.
I am going away, Ebenezer.
You will not see me again.
But you were gonna marry me.
No.
You have found another love to replace me.
She's much more desirable than I am.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
This lady here.
How shall I ever understand this world?
There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and yet, there is nothing it condemns with such severity as the pursuit of wealth.
You fear the world too much,
Ebenezer.
All your nobler dreams that I loved
I've seen die off one by one until only the desire for gain is left.
I'm not changed towards you, am I?
Yes, you are.
Your promise to me was made when you were poor and content to be so.
- You were someone else then.
- I was a boy.
You see?
Your own feelings tell you that you are not what you were.
I see that all too clearly.
And so I can release you.
Have I ever asked to be released?
In words, no.
But in a changed nature, yes.
In everything that made my love of value to you, yes.
If you met me today, you would not love me.
- I would, I do.
- Shh.
- I still do.
- I'm trying to listen.
Isabel, I find it impossible to discuss personal affairs during business hours.
Now, please.
ISABEL:
You see?
If you weigh me by gain,
I weigh very little.
And so I am not enough for you.
And I release you with a full heart for the love of him you once were.
Say something, you fool.
Say something.
You may, for a little while, have pain in this, but it will pass.
And you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke.
OLD SCROOGE:
Don't go, it's a mistake. Don't go.
Be happy in the life you have chosen.
OLD SCROOGE:
Isabel.
Isabel?
Isabel.
[DOOR CLOSES]
You fool.
[SINGING]
You fool
I let you go away
And now I can see
Now you're a dream gone by
Oh, how could there be
Such a fool as I?
I who must travel on
What hope for me?
Dream where my past has gone
Live with a memory
You, my only hope
You, my only love
You, you
You
Spirit, remove me from this place.
I can bear it no more.
[CLOCK TICKING]
[SOBBING]
Stupid old fool.
Getting yourself all upset over nothing.
It's all in your imagination.
[CLOCK CHIMING]
The first at 1, the second at 2.
I'm ready for you, wherever you are.
Nothing.
[LAUGHTER]
GHOST:
Ebenezer Scrooge.
Come here, Scrooge.
I'm waiting for you.
Or shall I come in there and get you?
I'm coming.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
GHOST:
Welcome, Scrooge.
Is it too bright for you?
Come over here, you weird little man.
I am the Spirit of Christmas Present.
Now look upon me.
You have never seen the like of me before.
Never.
Yet, how many of my brothers have you rejected in your miserable lifetime?
I have never met any of your brothers, sir.
You have never looked for them.
Well, how many of them are there?
What year is this?
Then I have 1, 859 brothers.
Each year at this time, one of us visits this puny little planet to spread some happiness, and to remove as many as we can of the causes of human misery.
Which is why I have come to see you,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
[SCROOGE YELLS]
You're a funny-looking little creature.
I must admit, I found it hard to believe you'd be as horrible as my brothers said you'd be.
But now that I look at you, I can see they were understating the truth.
Let me assure you that I am a man of the highest principles and the most generous spirit.
Generous spirit? You?
You don't know the meaning of the phrase.
But you're about to find out.
Now, drink this.
- What is it?
- Taste it.
SCROOGE:
Mm.
Mm.
Do you like it?
It's wonderful.
I've never tasted anything like it.
Of course you haven't.
- What is it?
- The milk of human kindness.
There are more good things in this life, Scrooge, than you can possibly imagine.
I'm sure there are.
Can I have some more?
[SINGING] Ebenezer Scrooge
The sins of man are huge
A never-ending symphony
Of villainy and infamy
Duplicity, deceit and subterfuge
And no one's worse
Than Ebenezer Scrooge
Though man's a handy candidate
For hell
I must admit, life sometimes
Has its brighter side as well
I like life, life likes me
Life and I fairly fully agree
Life is fine, life is good
Especially mine
Which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
Life's a pleasure that I deny not
I like life here and now
Life and I made a mutual vow
Till I die, life and I
We'll both try to be better somehow
And if life were a woman
She would be my wife
- Why?
- Why?
Because I like life
That's all very well for you, but not for me.
I hate life.
Nonsense, man. Why?
Because life hates me, that's why.
Scrooge, you're an even bigger fool than I took you for.
I've never heard such a lot of self-pitying drivel.
You don't even know how to live.
Now you listen to me.
I like life
Well, go on.
[SINGING]
I like life
That's better.
[SINGING]
Life likes me
Life likes me
Good, good.
I make life a perpetual spree
A perpetual spree
Eating food
Drinking wine
Thinking who'd like the privilege
To dine me
I like drinking the drink I'm drinking
That's better, Scrooge.
I like thinking the thoughts
I'm thinking
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music and I'm in a trance
- Tra-la-la
- Oom-pa-pa
Chances are we shall get up
And prance
[SCROOGE LAUGHS]
Where there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
- Why?
- Why?
Because I like life
[SCROOGE LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY]
BOTH [SINGING]:
Where there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
Why? Because I like life
See how much we like life
[GHOST GRUNTS]
[GHOST CHUCKLING
AND SCROOGE GRUNTING]
What happened? What's happened?
What the devil am I doing in a pile of snow in the middle of the night?
That's what I'd like to know.
Where are we?
Now, Scrooge, over there lies the lavish home of Robert Cratchit, esquire, who owes both the opulence of his surroundings and the magnificence of his Christmas celebrations to the high principles and generous spirit of his employer.
Here. I want to look in the window.
It will cost you nothing, which I'm sure will be good news for you.
Will they be able to see me?
No, which I feel sure will be good news for them.
I could do with another of them drinks.
Later.
For the time being, I think it better you see things as they really are.
Oh, nectar. Pure nectar.
And at only tuppence a pint, you can't really grumble.
What a tragedy it is that Her Majesty and His Worship the Lord Mayor couldn't be with us tonight.
They don't know what they're missing.
Now you try that, my love.
Mm. Bob Cratchit, you're a genius.
JOY:
The stuffing's ready, father.
The marriage of roast goose and sage and onion stuffing à la Cratchit is one of the culinary miracles of our day.
[MRS. CRATCHIT CHUCKLES]
And a living legend throughout the length and breadth of Camden Town.
Now, the only remaining problem, my dear, is whether to put the stuffing inside the goose or the goose inside the stuffing.
[KIDS LAUGH]
But since the ultimate intention is to put them both inside ourselves,
I don't suppose it very much matters.
And here they are, the one and only carol-singing Cratchits.
Newly returned from their triumphant musical tour.
How did you do, Tiny Tim?
- Ten pence ha'penny.
- Ooh. Well done.
Another fantastic coup by young Timothy Cratchit.
The financial wizard.
At only 7 years of age, the youngest millionaire in the vast Cratchit empire.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may steal a moment of your valuable time,
I would ask you to drink a toast to the sparkling good health of the two gentlemen whose industry and generosity have provided our sumptuous Christmas repast.
- Master Timothy Cratchit.
MRS. CRATCHIT: Tim.
And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
MRS. CRATCHIT: What are you trying to do, ruin our Christmas?
But his money paid for the goose, my dear.
No, your money paid for the goose, my dear.
But he paid me the money.
Because you earned it, my love.
Fifteen shillings a week at three pence an hour.
And not a penny rise in eight years.
Believe me, you earned it.
Oh, Mr. Scrooge assures me that times are hard.
He's right. For you they are.
But not for himself.
Well, nonetheless, he is the founder of our feast and we shall drink to him.
Quite right.
You, listen to this.
The founder of our feast indeed.
I wish I had him here.
I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon.
He'd have indigestion for a month.
CRATCHIT: Ethel, my dear, the children. It's Christmas.
It needs to be Christmas, Bob, to drink to a rotten, hard, stingy old miser like Scrooge.
- But, Ethel...
- You know he is, Bob.
Nobody knows it better than you, my poor love.
To Christmas, my dear.
Children, we shall drink to your father, for all the love and happiness he gives us.
And to Tiny Tim for the health we wish him.
And for the sake of your father,
I'll even drink to that old miser,
Mr. Scrooge.
Long life to him and to us all.
A Merry Christmas to us all.
Merry Christmas.
CRATCHIT:
God bless us.
God bless us, everyone.
As I said to the Lord Mayor, if Her Most Gracious Majesty is feeling bored, I said, you wheel her over to Camden town,
I said.
A glass of Bob Cratchit's hot punch and a song from Tiny Tim and we'll have her back on her regal feet in no time.
[KIDS LAUGH]
Well, there's your punch.
Now where's our song, my Tiny Tim?
KIDS: Tiny Tim.
- Come on, Tim.
- Song, song now.
- Come on, Tim.
[SINGING] On a beautiful day
That I dream about
In a world I would love to see
Is a beautiful place
Where the sun comes out
And it shines in the sky for me
On this beautiful winter's morning
If my wish could come true somehow
Then the beautiful day
That I dream about
Would be here and now
On this beautiful winter's morning
If my wish could come true somehow
Then the beautiful day
That I dream about
Would be here
And now
[ALL CLAPPING]
CRATCHIT:
Good boy.
MRS. CRATCHIT:
Well done, Tiny Tim, well done.
GHOST:
What an unpleasant child.
You know, Scrooge, there are few things more nauseating to see than a happy family enjoying themselves at Christmas.
Do you not agree?
I think Bob Cratchit's really rather fond of me.
Ho-ho-ho. And so is his wife.
Couldn't you tell?
She doesn't really know me.
That is one of the few things wherein fate has blessed her.
And, uh, what will become of Tiny Tim?
What's this?
Concern over a sick child?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Don't mock me, spirit.
Is the child very sick?
Not that it's of any great importance to me whether he is or not, but is he?
Well, of course he's sick.
You mean he's seriously ill?
Will he live? Well, will he?
What does it matter to you,
Ebenezer Scrooge?
If he's going to die, then he'd better do it and decrease the surplus population.
We have one more call to make.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please honor me with your undivided attention?
The time has come that I know you all look forward to in this house every Christmas Eve, when I ask you to drink to the good health and long life of my celebrated Uncle Ebenezer.
[DISCONTENTED CLAMOR]
Sounds to me as if he knows I'm here.
Of course he doesn't.
He can't see you.
Harry, I've visited you every Christmas for the past five years, and to this day I can never understand this extraordinary ritual of toasting the health of your old Uncle Ebenezer.
I mean, everybody knows he's the most miserable old skinflint that ever walked God's earth.
- Who's he?
- Oh, just a friend.
My dear Tom, it's very simple.
He is indeed the most despicable old miser, worse than you could ever possibly imagine.
[ALL LAUGH]
- You find this amusing?
- Believe it or not, he likes you.
HARRY:
You see, I look at it this way:
If I can wish a Merry Christmas to him, who is beyond dispute the most obnoxious and parsimonious of all living creatures...
ALL:
Hear.
HARRY: Then I know in my heart that I am truly a man of goodwill.
- Scoundrel.
- Wait, there's more to come.
And besides, I like old Scrooge.
- What did I tell you?
HARRY: Truly I do.
I can't help feeling that hidden somewhere deep inside that loathsome old carcass of his there's a different man fighting to get out.
Be careful, he may be worse than the one you know.
HARRY:
Oh, God forbid, Tom.
Anyway, that's the reason I ask him to come here every Christmas.
In the forlorn hope that one day he might pick up enough goodwill to raise his clerk's wages by five shillings a week.
MAN:
Hear, hear.
HARRY:
God knows it's high time he did.
He's playing with other people's money.
HARRY'S WIFE:
All right, Harry, that's enough.
I refuse to have Christmas haunted by Uncle Ebenezer.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
We'll have some dancing and some music.
Then we'll play some splendid party games.
There's a charming new game called The Minister's Cat.
It's very funny.
You'll all end up getting very angry when you lose.
And as for you, nephew, if you were in my will, I'd disinherit you.
Scrooge. Come over here.
You need some more of this.
Hmph. Raise my clerk's wages.
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
Mm. Mm.
[SCROOGE CHUCKLES]
[CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]
[CLAPPING]
I know that tune.
I used to sing it when I was a lad.
KEN:
The minister's cat is a lonely cat
GRAHAM:
The minister's cat is a languid cat
GORDON:
The minister's cat is a lordly cat
MARY:
The minister's cat is a lazy cat
GUY:
The minister's cat is a ludicrous cat
HARRY'S WIFE:
The minister's cat is a lascivious cat
JAMES:
The minister's cat is a...
- Too late, you're out.
- Oh, no.
He's out, he's out.
He's out.
You see, they get furious when they lose. It's lovely.
He's out, next M. Come on, M, M, M.
Now M.
The minister's cat is a marvelous cat
The minister's cat is a marmalade cat
- Marmalade.
- The minister's cat is a miserable cat
- Miserable.
- The minister's cat is a merciful cat
- Merciful.
- The minister's cat is a... Uh...
Merry, say merry.
[ALL LAUGHING]
- Oh, damn it.
- I told you to say merry.
Why are you so stupid?
He's always been stupid.
- Stop yawning when I'm talking to you.
- What next?
- N, N.
- N.
- The minister's cat is a naughty cat
- Quickly, quickly.
- The minister's cat is a noble cat
- Noble cat.
- The minister's cat is a nebulous cat
- Nebulous.
- The minister's cat is a...
- Nasty cat.
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, I'm not out.
- I was just about to say nasty.
- You fool, it's too late.
You could have said neglectful, nervous, nauseating.
You're out, you're out, you're out.
The minister's cat is an orange cat
- The minister's cat is an old cat
- Yes.
SCROOGE: Look, I was rather good at it but I... But I didn't...
Oh, thank you, my boy.
What a wonderful evening.
That Minister's Cat game, splendid.
I thought I was rather good at it.
Good night, good night. Thank you.
I can honestly say that I haven't enjoyed a Christmas as much as this since I was a young apprentice at old Fezziwig's so, so many years ago.
Yes.
What Christmases we used to have in those days.
Fantastic they were.
He had this daughter.
Reminded me a little bit of your mother, she did.
Her name was Isabel.
Oh.
Oh, Isabel.
WOMAN [SINGING]:
They say happiness
Is the folly of fools
Pity poor me, one of the fools
- Happiness
- Happiness...
Was standing beside me.
I could see her
She could see me
Happiness is whatever
You want it to be
Yes, Scrooge.
I have brought you home.
You're not going?
My time upon this little planet is very brief.
I must leave you now.
But we still have so much to talk about, haven't we?
There is never enough time to do or say all the things that we would wish.
The thing is to try to do as much as you can in the time that you have.
- Yes, but...
- Remember, Scrooge, time is short.
And suddenly, you're not there anymore.
SCROOGE:
No, wait. Don't go.
Don't leave me.
Where are you?
Why is it so dark?
I can't see.
I can't see, I can't see.
I can't see, I can't...
[PANTING]
Oh, my God. What am I doing here?
Oh, I'm in bed.
That's what I'm doing here.
This is where I'm supposed to be in the middle of the night.
Was I dreaming again?
I must have been.
That giant.
[CLOCK CHIMING NEARBY]
I must be mad. There are no giants.
[CLOCK BELL CHIMES]
There are no ghosts.
[GASPS]
Am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?
And you are to show me shadows of the things that will happen in the time before?
Is that so, spirit?
Ghost of the Future, I fear you more than any apparition I have seen.
But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to be another man from what I was,
I am prepared to bear you company.
Will you speak to me?
The night is waning fast and I know that time is precious to me.
Lead on, spirit. Lead on.
[THUNDER CRASHES]
There you are, me friends.
Shining as bright as the happy thoughts the mere mention of the name
Scrooge brings to our minds.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today because we are united by a common bond.
ALL:
Yeah!
Namely our feelings of gratitude to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
[CROWD CHEERS]
TOM: I don't think any of us can ever hope to find the words to describe the true depth of our feelings towards him.
[CHEERING AND CHATTERING]
Is this the future?
All right, my friends, all right.
I understand your excitement.
That's Tom Jenkins, the hot soup man.
TOM: We are all overjoyed...
- He owes me 6 pounds.
I must say he looks uncommonly happy for someone so deep in debt.
All these people owe me money.
They love me and I never knew.
Kindly hold down your emotions, if you please.
- Now, we are all deeply moved.
ALL: Yes.
And those of us what has been in debt to Mr. S over all these years will never forget what a rare and beautiful thing he has just done for us all.
- Right?
ALL: Right.
Three cheers for Mr. Scrooge.
- Hip, hip, hooray!
ALL: Hooray!
What did I do? What did I do?
Whatever it was, it has made them truly happy, and I am the cause.
My friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I shall remember this moment until my dying day.
[CROWD CHEERS]
ALL [SINGING]:
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
[CROWD CHEERS]
May I say in all humility
[ALL CHEER]
I have labored unceasingly all my life.
[ALL CHEER]
To be worthy of this moving demonstration of your feelings towards me.
[ALL CHEER]
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all the people who have assembled here
- I would merely like to mention if I may
ALL: You may.
[SINGING]
That our unanimous attitude
Is one of lasting gratitude
For what our friend
Has done for us today
[ALL LAUGH]
And therefore
I would simply like to say
ALL:
You may.
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
I may sound double Dutch
But my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war
Has been won for me
And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out
To add a sort of final victory touch
But since I left me flag at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very, much
[ALL LAUGHING]
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It sounds a bit bizarre
But things the way they are
I feel as if another life's
Begun for me
And if I had a cannon I would fire it
To add a sort of celebration touch
But since I left me cannon at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It isn't every day
Good fortune comes me way
I never thought
The future would be fun for me
- And if I...
- Hey.
You've woken my baby.
Will you keep quiet?
Beg your pardon, lady.
[SINGING QUIETLY]
And if I had a bugle I would blow it
Shh.
[SINGING LOUDER] To add
A sort of how's your father touch
But since I left my bugle at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much
No, no, dear friends.
It is I who should thank you.
- Thank you very much
- Thank you very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
The future looks all right
In fact it looks so bright
I feel as if they're polishing
The sun for me
- And if I had a drum I'd have to...
- If I had a drum I'd have to bang it
To add a sort of
Humpty Dumpty touch
But since I left me drummer at home
I'll simply have to say...
The color hurts my eyes.
I mustn't show weak eyes to your father when he gets home.
- It must be near his time.
- Past it.
But I think he's walked a little slower these last few evenings.
MRS. CRATCHIT: I've known him walk with Tiny Tim on his shoulder very fast indeed.
But he was light to carry for it was no trouble, no trouble.
Where is Tiny Tim?
Take me to him.
TINY TIM [SINGING FAINTLY]:
On this beautiful winter's morning
If my wish could come true somehow
Then the beautiful day
That I dream about
Would be here
And now
I must go now, my little fellow.
I promised your mother
I'd help her with the Christmas dinner.
I'll come and see you again tomorrow.
Same time.
All right?
[SOBBING]
Oh, Tim.
Poor Tiny Tim.
Spirit, you've shown me a Christmas yet to come that mingles great happiness with great sadness.
But what is to become of me?
No, no. Please, I beg you.
I've seen the error of my ways.
I will repent.
Truly, I will repent!
[SCREAMING]
Help! Help!
Help, help!
[RUMBLING]
[SNIFFS]
[MUTTERS]
[GRUNTS]
[SIZZLES]
VOICE:
Ah.
So there you are.
Marley.
Where am I?
I should have thought it was obvious.
I heard you were coming down today, so I thought I'd come to greet you.
Show you to your quarters.
[SCREAMING NEARBY]
Nobody else wanted to.
[SCROOGE WHIMPERING]
That's very civil of you, Marley.
- I am dead, aren't I?
- As a coffin nail.
[CLANKING]
- I'd rather hoped I'd end up in heaven.
- Did you indeed?
You may find your office here rather small, but not, I trust, unfamiliar.
Office?
Your activities in life were so pleasing to Lucifer, that he has appointed you to be his personal clerk.
A singular honor.
You will be to him, so to speak, what Bob Cratchit was to you.
That's not fair. Aah! It's...
- It's...
- Diabolical.
I must confess
I find it not altogether unamusing.
Here we are, my dear Ebenezer.
[BELL RINGS]
Your office.
It's freezing cold in here.
Lucifer turned the heat off.
He thought it might make you drowsy.
You'll be the only man in hell who's chilly.
Watch out for the rats.
They nibble things.
Rats?
[WHIMPERING]
MARLEY:
Oh.
I almost forgot.
I knew there was something.
They apologize that your
[CLANKING NEARBY]
Chain wasn't ready for your arrival.
It's so big, they had to take on extra devils at the foundry to finish it.
It's even bigger than I thought it would be.
Oh.
[SNICKERS]
Here it is now.
Don't let them do this to me, Marley.
I beg you.
That's quite a chain, isn't it?
Help me. Help me.
Bah, humbug.
Merry Christmas.
Don't leave me, Marley.
Help!
Help, help!
Help, help, help!
Help!
[GASPING]
Where am I?
I'm in my own room.
I'm not in hell at all.
I haven't got any chains.
Perhaps it didn't happen after all.
Perhaps it did.
But I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I've got a chance to change and I will not be the man I was.
I'll begin again.
I will build my life.
I will live to know that I've fulfilled my life.
I'll begin today.
Throw away the past, and the future I build will be something that will last.
I will take the time I have left to live and I will give it all that I have left to give.
[SINGING]
I will live my days for my fellow men
And I'll live in praise
Of that moment when
I was able to begin again
I will start anew
I will make amends
And I'll make quite certain
That the story ends
On a note of hope
On a strong amen
And I'll thank the world
And remember when
I was able to
Begin again
[LAUGHING]
I don't know what to do.
Yes, begin again.
I'm as light as a feather.
I'm as happy as an angel.
I'm as giddy as a drunken man.
A Merry Christmas, everybody.
Oh, Jacob Marley, wherever you are, you shall see a change in me, Jacob.
I swear it.
[LAUGHING AND YELLING]
Boy. Boy, boy, what day is it?
- Today?
- Today.
Why, Christmas day, of course.
It's Christmas day.
I haven't missed it.
The spirits have done it all in one night.
Well, they can do what they like, you see.
Of course they can.
Of course they can. Ha, ha.
- Hello, my fine young fellow.
- Hello.
Do you know the butcher's in the next street but one?
I should hope so.
What a remarkable boy.
An intelligent boy.
Do you happen to know if they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up in the window?
Not the big one, the enormous one.
What, you mean the one as big as me?
Ha, ha. What a wonderful boy.
So witty. It's a pleasure to talk to him.
- Yes, that's the one.
- It's still there.
It is? Go and buy it.
- What's that?
- Here's two sovereigns.
Go and wake up the butcher and tell him to open his shop.
Meet me there in ten minutes.
Be holding that turkey and I'll give you a half a crown.
Go on, run. Run, run.
Run, run.
Oh, what a lovely boy.
I think I'm gonna like children.
Now, that's what I call a turkey.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.
Come on, dear boy.
Let's go and open the toy shop.
Thank you. Merry Christmas.
And I'll have that and some of those.
And the hobby horse, and then some flutes and...
And some trumpets.
And that doll.
- And some bows and arrows.
- Bow and arrows.
Yes and... Oh, yes, and I...
- I must have a cricket bat.
- Ha, ha.
And these, and these.
And a horse and a spinning top.
And a piano.
And... And all those dolls.
- All of them?
- Yes.
I like that one.
Oh, and this beautiful coach.
- And several kites and the horse.
- Yes, yes.
- And these boats.
- Yes.
And some of these.
Oh!
I'll have that.
Now, how much is all this?
- Oh. Uh... Oh.
- Well, never mind.
Here are some sovereigns and you can keep the change.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.
And I shall require the services of several small boys to help to transport these delightful objects to their destination.
And each boy shall receive a half a crown.
Half a crown, yes, Mr. Scrooge.
Mr. Scrooge, what has happened?
What happened is perfectly simple,
Pringle.
I've discovered that I like life.
[KIDS LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
I like life
Life likes me
Life and I fairly fully agree
Life is fine
Life is good
Especially mine
Which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
Life's a pleasure that I deny not
I like life, here and now
Life and I made a mutual vow
Till I die, life and I
We'll both try to be better somehow
And if life were a woman
She would be my wife
[KIDS LAUGH]
Why?
Because I like life
[KIDS CHEER]
SCROOGE:
Oh, look, a slide.
No, let me. Let me, let me.
[YELLS THEN GRUNTS]
[ALL LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
I like life
Life likes me
I'll make life a perpetual spree
Eating food, drinking wine
Thinking who'll have the privilege
To dine me
I like living the life of pleasure
Pausing only to take my leisure
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music and I'm in a trance
[PLAYING PLEASANT MELODY]
Tra-la-la, oom-pa-pa
Chances are I shall get up and prance
[SCROOGE HUMMING]
Where's there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
KIDS: Why?
- Why?
Because I like life
Uncle Ebenezer.
Oh, Merry Christmas to you, my dear nephew.
And to your enchanting wife.
We were just on our way to your house with some presents.
These are for you.
From an old fool who deeply regrets the Christmases gone by that he might have shared with you, and...
This is for you, my dear.
A sort of belated wedding present.
Oh, Uncle Ebenezer, thank you.
Christmas lunch is sharp at 3.
May we expect you?
You may.
I'll be there. Oh, you are a pretty girl.
[ALL SINGING]
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music and I'm in a trance
Tra-la-la, oom-pa-pa
Chances are
I shall get up and prance
Where there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
Why?
Because I like life
Father Christmas
He's the greatest man
In the whole wide world
In the whole wide world
And he knows it
Every Christmas, Father Christmas
Puts a great big sack
On his dear old back
Because he loves us all
And he knows it
And he goes for a sleigh ride
If it snows, then he may ride all night
But that's all right
[LAUGHING]
KIDS:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
SCROOGE:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
KIDS: In the morning
SCROOGE: In the morning
KIDS: Christmas morning
SCROOGE: Christmas morning
If you lift your eyes
There's a big surprise
On your bed you'll see
There's a gift from Father Christmas
From Father Christmas
- That's how Christmas ought to be
- Ha, ha. Hey!
Merry Christmas.
A Merry Christmas to you, sir, from Father Christmas himself.
MRS. CRATCHIT:
Oh, dear.
Don't worry about your goose,
Mrs. Cratchit.
You can use it as stuffing for this.
Now, where are the other presents?
This dolly is for you, my dear.
And this one is for you.
And this pretty little dolly is for you.
It's the dolly in the corner.
[SCROOGE CHUCKLES]
- And those are for you, my boy.
- Thank you.
And these, Bob Cratchit, are for you and your good lady.
I must leave you now.
As you can imagine, it's a very busy day for me.
And I have many more calls to make.
Ah! I almost forgot.
[KIDS CHATTERING]
This is for you.
You didn't steal it, did you?
Ha, ha. No, I didn't steal it.
It's a present for you to keep.
A Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim.
You still don't recognize me, do you, Bob Cratchit?
Yes. Uh, no.
- You're Father Christmas?
- No.
[SHRIEKS]
It's Mr. Scrooge. He's gone mad.
It's all right, my dear.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
No, I haven't gone mad.
And on Monday when your salary will be doubled...
Doubled? He has gone mad.
- We'll sit together and discuss how I can help your family.
To start with, we'll find the right doctors to get Tiny Tim well.
And we will get him well, you know, Bob.
Yes, I believe you.
I'll believe anything.
And may this be the merriest
Christmas of all our lives.
[CHEERING]
Tom Jenkins, Tom Jenkins.
About that 6 pounds you owe me.
You agreed to give me a few more days, I just need...
You can keep it.
It's my Christmas present to you.
God bless you this Christmas day,
Mr. Scrooge.
Thank you very much.
[SINGING]
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It sounds a bit bizarre
But things the way they are
I feel as if another life's begun for me
And that goes for anyone else who owes me money, you can keep it.
As of this day, all my debts are ended.
[ALL SINGING] And if I had a drum
I'd have to bang it
To add a sort of
Humpty Dumpty touch
But since I left my drummer at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much
PUPPETS [SINGING]:
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It isn't every day
Good fortune comes my way
I never thought
The future would be fun for me
And if I had a bugle I would blow it
To add a sort of
How's your father touch
But since I left my bugle at home
I'll simply have to say
Gentlemen, Merry Christmas.
ALL:
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.
Come to my office on Monday morning and I will give you a hundred guineas for your most worthy cause.
And the same every Christmas.
Thank you very, very much,
Mr. Scrooge.
[ALL SINGING]
Thank you very, very, very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
The future looks all right
In fact it looks so bright
I feel as if they're polishing
The sun for me
- Sing a Christmas carol
- Sing a Christmas carol
Sing a Christmas carol
Like the children do
And if I had a cannon I would fire it
To add a sort of celebration touch
And enjoy the beauty
All the joy and beauty
That a Merry Christmas...
And since I left my cannon at home
- I'll simply have to say
- Christmas is here
Thank you very, very, very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
I may sound double Dutch
But my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war
- Has been won for me
- Come along, boys.
And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out
To add a sort of final victory touch
But since I left me flag at home
I'll simply have to say
[PANTING]
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very, very, very much
Merry Christmas.
[HUMMING]
CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHING]
Hello.
I don't know whether you can hear me, old Jacob Marley.
And I don't know whether or not
I imagined the things I saw.
But between the pair of us we...
We finally made a Merry Christmas, didn't we?
I have to leave you now.
Must go and get ready.
I'm going to have Christmas dinner with my family.
Daddy, do you know what I saw?
It was the most fantastic thing.
Come look.
My son.
Look, son,
I'm really busy... but I'll tell you what I do need.
I need some good luck.
Okay, Mr. Lucky, it's time we divvy up the loot.
Look at all of these things.
What a night.
What do you think of this?
This is pretty. I'll take those.
Try that. lsn't that pretty?
I better keep that.
That's pretty nice.
I think I better take that.
You shouldn't have that.
I better take that.
You're too young for that.
Look at that watch.
I'll take that.
That's a pretty watch.
It's time I got myself another knife.
So I oughta give you this.
You never know when a knife might come in handy.
You want some gold?
There's lots of gold.
You know, I'll bet this is the most valuable piece here.
It's Bucephalus, the magic horse of Alexander the Great.
A long time ago, this king was gonna kill Bucephalus... because he was so wild the king couldn't ride him.
He had Bucephalus brought into a big arena.
People came from all around.
They wanted to see this horse that was the biggest... and the blackest and the strongest, most beautiful horse that ever was.
King Philip walked out there and looked at some of his men.
He said, 'Kill that horse.'
Just then a voice called out from the edge of the crowd.
It said, 'I can ride that horse.'
Everybody said, 'Who said that?'
It was a little kid, just about your size, just about your age.
King Philip said...
'Son, if you can ride that horse, you can have that horse.'
So Alexander walked out into the big arena.
Standing in the middle of the arena was Bucephalus.
He was big, and he was strong.
He was pawing the ground... and there was fire in his eyes... and there was smoke coming out of his nose.
He went--
Alexander walked up... then quick as a cat, he jumped up on his back.
He grabbed hold of that long, black mane... and away they went, like lightning.
He jumped right over the crowd, over the stand... and went ridin' out over the hill.
Everybody said, 'Whew!'
Smoke comin' out of his nose!
Fire in his eyes.
Fire in his eyes!
That's the way I heard the story.
Here. I want you to have this.
Bucephalus.
Dad, what's going on?
- Ow!
- Alec!
- Alec, come here!
Just take it easy.
We'll be okay.
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Put this on.
Help me with this. Here.
Come here, son.
Put this life vest on.
It's okay.
Tie the bottom.
Let's get outta here!
Hang onto that rail!
Stay right there!
I'll be back!
Stay there! I'm gonna help these guys!
Don't move! Hang on!
- Help!
- Hey, Alec!
Dad!
Help!
Dad!
Help!
Help!
Help!
He saved my life.
I can't leave the island without him.
- He'll die without me.
Stop!
Let me go!
Black!
Black, come on!
Black!
'Ode to Alec Ramsey.'
'I think that I shall never see... a boy as brave as Alec Ramsey.
Hunger and thirst, in fear and pain.
He lived because his heart had aim.
A horse as black as night to day... a beast, a god... with whom he did stay.
They slept on the sand and played in the ocean.
And rode over the island in a singular motion.
Now, here he sits, a hero among boys... with the love of a horse, much more than mere toys.'
I'm very happy to have my son back.
Thank you. I wish you could have saved his father too.
You're kind of a pretty horse.
- What--
Black, no!
No!
Black, come back!
Alec!
Wow!
Yes, I saw a black horse!
It ran thataway!
Whoa.
What happened to you?
- Everything.
- Everything?
That's a whole lot.
Can't be everything.
You lost a black horse.
Yeah. Have you seen him?
Do you know where he is?
- Napoleon... did you tell me you saw a black stallion?
Well, what did he say?
He says,
'Well, not very far from here.'
Just past the dairy... there's a big black barn.
Then you see a long bunch of skinny trees... that you walk around.
Then you go right by a morning star.
You keep following that star... and see a large patch of green grass.
Then you stop.
Then you listen.
Pretty soon you'll see just what you've been looking for.
Hey, Black!
Black?
Black!
Black, it's you!
You okay?
I knew it was you.
What do you think you're doin' over there, sonny?
I'm gettin' my horse!
You're a big, fat thief!
- Nobody's a thief.
- You are!
I said, 'Nobody's a thief.'
Who do you think you're callin' a thief?
This is my place.
I'm thinkin' that's my horse.
No, he's mine!
Hold on, son.
Wait a minute.
- What are you gonna do here, buddy?
What are you gonna do?
Easy.
Maybe he is yours... but I spent all last night tryin' to catch this wild horse.
All night I spent.
You're just lucky I got him instead of the police.
Hear me?
He kicked a garbageman?
He's somethin', all right.
Did you have any breakfast?
Henry, I think he likes it out here.
Tried cows. It didn't work.
5:00 in the morning.
Chickens--
They just about drove me nuts.
Chickens.
Look, if you clean this stall up in here real good... and you get it fit for him,
I could let you have it.
There are too many red cards. ls The Black fast?
He's fast.
Fast enough to be a racehorse?
That Black is a desert horse.
He's fast, all right.
Sure, he's fast.
But he hasn't got any papers.
Fast or not, I don't think they'd ever let him run.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Why did you stop training?
I got tired.
Do you think you'll ever try it again?
Sure, I do.
Sure.
It's work.
Worth it, though.
Hold onto him good, son.
Stay in the center of him.
Turn him around the other way.
The other way, son.
Bring him in and turn him around.
Now send him down around here.
It comes as no surprise that again this week... both Sunraider, the fiery red stallion from the West... and Cyclone, the sleek gray from the East... have won their races with ease.
They have won with monotonous regularity.
But, hey-hey, let's see these two champions... run head-to-head.
Perhaps horse fans will be treated to the match race of the century.
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville, from Belmont.
Lookin' this way.
Not lookin' down on the ground.
Lookin' straight ahead.
That's right.
You want to see what's comin', you look underneath your arm.
Not over your shoulder.
Down under here. ln here. See what's going on down there, all around you.
You can scoot and boot, understand?
Then you've got your balance.
Keep your knees in close when you're puttin' your stirrups on.
Check down underneath here too.
Get that leather outta your way.
Pull it back in there underneath so that your knees--
Nothin' in the way in here.
All right.
Now you're up. Feel that?
Feel that in your legs?
Hmm? Feel it pullin' on your legs back here?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
Look ahead down the lane.
No, you don't jump straight up and down.
Just try and keep your body as still as possible.
He'll be movin'.
He'll be makin' that rhythm.
You just go on with him.
You don't have to pump him.
Just kind of go straight ahead with him.
Just like you're throwing it away, like this.
Throw it away.
That's right.
Throw it away.
That's right.
When a horse starts outta that gate, you've got to remember this.
Remember, you don't want him to outbreak you.
You know what that means?
That horse starts to settle--
They open that gate, wham, like that.
Some of 'em just scat!
You can't do that, so you grab a handful of mane... just before he says, 'Go,' so he don't outbreak you.
Because they'd open that gate, and you'd just be sittin' in midair.
You understand?
- This Black can outbreak you.
- Right.
He can move right on out there.
You know, Alec...
'secrecy.'
That's the key word.
Yeah. Okay.
Don't just say, 'Okay.'
Know what I'm talking about.
It's a secret.
You and me, we have a secret.
Now, listen to me.
We'll just make this an easy workout.
- You understand?
- All right.
Get him used to this place.
Jake and I will be here with Napoleon.
You go down to the half-mile pole and watch me.
I'll give you the start by dropping my hand.
Then I want you to work him for a half mile.
I want to you to breeze him for a half mile... then pull him up, nice and easy.
Go down to the half-mile pole and watch me.
Come on! Let's go!
Too much horse for your boy.
Jake, he's gonna be all right.
Hyah. Come on, Nappy.
Let's go.
- Whoa.
Come on! Giddap! Go on, get him!
Pull him up!
Pull him up, Nappy!
On the inside!
Come on, Jake.
Hey, your hand's-- You all right?
I'm okay.
I better walk him now.
All right, go ahead.
Cool him out, son.
Did you get what I got?
Right on the button.
That horse has got speed he ain't even tapped yet.
You're not--
You're not actually--
You're not.
You are outta your mind.
That monster has no more business being out on this track with class--
He's fast, but he's wild.
You saw him zigzagging all over the course.
What about his papers?
- He ain't got any.
- He ain't?
That's taste.
What are you gonna do?
Hitch him up to a plow?
No.
I got an idea.
A match race?
Cyclone?
You are too much.
You are really too much.
You got me thinking crazy too.
Squeeze my hand.
I want to try something here.
You feel that?
That's a pretty good grip.
That's not bad, but we're gonna have to work on your grip.
What I used when I was a rider was this ball. See how--
- What does a ball do?
- It strengthens your band.
No matter what you're doin' through the day, just use this ball.
Let me see you do it. Next time you grip my hand, we'll see a difference.
This reporter has the hottest racing news of the year.
Hold onto your hats.
The most sensational match race imaginable... between Cyclone from the East and Sunraider from the West... is finally set for the afternoon of August 15 at Santa Anita.
They'll go over two gruelling miles to prove once and for all... which is really the greatest champion.
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville from Belmont.
Well, whoever you are... here we go.
It's open.
Sure is quiet in here today.
Anything wrong with that?
The Black, he--
He just wouldn't play.
He just stands there and looks out into the rain.
Maybe The Black is blue today.
- Did you ever think of that?
- 'Blue'?
Rain, man, rain.
Rain.
We're gonna show everybody that he's the fastest horse in the world.
You think you know that animal?
Yeah, I know him.
I don't know.
I get a funny feeling.
I feel right now that you better let that horse stay wild, Alec.
It's his soul.
Easy, Black.
- He ain't gonna show.
- I don't wanna hear that.
He'll show. He'll be here.
He probably doesn't even remember us.
- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.
I tell you, he's gonna be here.
He's busy.
He's a little jumpy.
Come on. We'll work him.
Get him out there.
Henry!
- You okay?
- Where'd he get you?
- On my arm.
- Here?
- ls it broken?
- Leave it alone!
It's all right.
He just nicked me.
Will you please stop?
All right. What?
It's him.
- It's him.
- No.
It's him, by God.
I tell you, it's him.
It is him.
Yeah. All right. It's him.
All right. Give him a leg up there.
Remember, this is our big chance.
It's up to you.
Take him out.
Come on! Bring him on!
Hey! He's out cold.
He passed out.
Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady.
- Got him.
- Give me your knife.
- All right.
- Watch it. Hold him steady.
Whoa, sonny.
Here.
- Where'd you get this animal?
- Get him off.
Good boy.
- Get him outta here.
- I got him.
Watch yourself.
Watch it, sir.
Whoa, boy.
What happened?
Did I fall off?
No.
No, you hung on like a champ.
What happened?
Where's The Black?
It's all right.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
He's over in the van with Nappy.
He did good, didn't he?
He did great.
You did great.
You all right?
- How did you like what you saw?
- I wasn't disappointed.
Disappointed?
You never saw a horse run like that in your life.
This could put you back in the action, eh, Dailey?
Don't get hard with me.
You know I never liked it.
I need this race.
I need it bad, and you can do it.
Will you do it? lf that horse goes like that with a kid...
- what will he do with a real rider?
- The race.
Nice going, kid.
You got guts.
You heard me say that Cyclone and Sunraider... are the fastest horses in the world today.
I'm going to eat those words now because I've seen another horse... that defies the imagination, that runs like a demon possessed... at night, alone, at speeds beyond belief.
He's never run a race, and he comes out of nowhere... but he could be the greatest sensation in racing history.
So I challenge the owners of both Cyclone... and Sunraider to meet this mystery horse in their upcoming match race.
This isn't a joke.
This mystery horse is real, and I'll stake my reputation on it.
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville from Belmont.
Do you know any real good, famous jockeys?
There are a lot of 'em.
George Wolf, the lceman.
That's just what they call him.
Georgie Wolf.
They call him in the newspapers the lceman... because he sits chilly on a horse.
That means he sits there and he can wait.
He knows what to do.
He's studying a horse.
He's up there ridin', goin' on with him.
You know what I mean?
He's sittin' up there, goin' on... just studyin' him!
Studyin' him.
Just studyin' him.
When it's time to make his move... he'll say--
Here comes the lceman!
Mom, do you want me to mow the lawn... or wash the dishes or something?
Sure.
Why don't you make all the beds and vacuum in here too?
- Mom, have you read this here? See?
- What is it?
This is more about that mystery horse.
Boy.
Remember last year when they were giving away aluminum ballpoint pens?
- The Black is the mystery horse.
- It's amazing the lengths... they will go to get people to go to a horse race.
And I'm gonna ride him.
- I'll get it!
What did you say? Wait!
Alec, wait one more second.
What did you say? Say that again.
The Black is the mystery horse, and I'm gonna ride him.
Alec, that horse is not the mystery horse.
Even if he were, you're not gonna ride him.
It was a secret.
I told you as soon as I could.
You're not supposed to keep secrets from your mother.
- Someone's at the door.
- I know!
- Mrs. Ramsey, how--
- Oh.
The Black is the mystery horse, and you're gonna ride him in a race.
All right. Well, well, well. lsn't this just fascinating timing?
What's been going on between you two guys and that horse?
- I have a right to know.
- Guess you've been talking to Alec.
I have been trying to. Would you like to tell me something about this?
- I'd be happy to.
- Come in, please.
It's quite a long story,
Mrs. Ramsey.
I'm sure it's a long story.
But you've got to be kidding, thinking I'll let him ride in a race.
My son could get killed in a horse race.
I think you could be exaggerating.
I'm not exaggerating.
Don't lie to me, Mr. Dailey.
You're willing to risk his life?
I'm not willing to risk his life.
I've lost a husband, and I'm not gonna lose a son.
I wouldn't hurt that boy for anything in the world.
What kind of dreams are you filling his head with?
It's much more than just a race.
Your son has his heart set on it.
Good-bye, Mr. Dailey.
Good-bye, Mrs. Ramsey.
So what happened to the new deal, the clean slate?
Alec, I can't let you ride in that horse race.
It's ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
What is that?
Alexander the Great's horse.
Dad gave it to me... just before the storm.
It reminds me of The Black and me.
Alexander's father gave it to him... before he died.
I was in the water.
I couldn't breathe.
It was dark and... l--
I yelled out for Dad, but--
I looked up, and there was The Black... and I grabbed onto him.
He saved your life, didn't he?
Oh, Alec.
What am I gonna do?
I gotta ride.
Okay, Alec.
Neville planned the publicity?
I'll bet the mystery horse don't even show.
Did you see that?
I'll beat him.
- I heard Mendoza's comin' in.
- Who's missing from the room?
- That beats him right there.
- Yeah. Who rides him?
Where did that guy over there get them silks?
- Looks like he's ready for Halloween.
- It sure does.
Rider number one, up.
- Number one, sir.
- Add two pounds.
Got that, George?
Rider number two now.
Thank you.
Rider number three.
Number three?
Number three?
How do I look?
Number three, please.
I don't think he's gonna show.
It's been a joke.
The mystery rider.
Hop on the scale.
-He's not strong enough to go two miles.
-No way. Too small.
- Rider on the scale, please.
- He's on the scale, sir.
He's on the scale?
Add it on.
Okay. All right.
Take him out.
All right, bring him right on out.
Two miles.
They'll come by the stands twice.
The stands are jammed.
He's moving on the black horse, the mystery horse.
Bring that horse.
Cyclone, settle! Whoa!
Whoa!
Stop, Black!
There's some problem with the mystery horse.
Cyclone keeping the pace.
They're in the front turn now.
He's won!
The mystery horse won!
This, ladies and gentlemen--
This horse has got a leg like iron.
It's gonna be all right, son.
Henry!
Well, here we are!
You're Tony and you're Tia.
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs. Grindley.
Oh, such fine-looking children.
I know you're anxious to see your rooms, but first we have some forms to fill out.
Then we'll join the others for dinner, all right?
Tia, what a pretty case!
Well.
It ain't nothing writing out those entry forms.
Wait'll she lays one of those enlightened punishments on you.
"After you watch the 5:00 news, you can write a 500-word composition."
Brother!
Tony, what should I put after sports?
Hmm, put "spectator."
Dumb pen's out of ink.
I'm finished. You can use mine.
Hey, I lost one just like this when I was coming in this barn.
- Tia's had that since Christmas.
- Sure she has.
Give it back!
Take it.
Now, children, that wasn't so difficult, was it?
No, ma'am.
Now, then.
Truck, I want you to wait for me in my office.
We'll read this together.
I keep forgetting what it feels like to sit down.
Now then, I know how both of you must feel.
Your foster parents are the only parents you remember.
Now that they've passed away, you're just a little bit scared.
We loved them very much.
Yes, ma'am, we miss them.
You only remember your adoptive name? Malone?
Tia was around three and I was five when the Malones adopted us.
Did either of you ever receive a birthday card from a relative?
Or perhaps a phone call at Christmas?
Something you may have forgotten.
Oft times the most trivial thing is important.
Tia?
What is it, dear? You look as though you're remembering something.
No. No, Mrs. Grindley. I'm sorry.
Why, there's nothing to be sorry about, dear.
You're out, Truck.
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something.
- Great catch!
- How'd you do it anyhow?
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.
Safe. There's something funny about this. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
Tony...
Cut it out, all right?
Ow!
Tony, why'd you do that?
You don't think we're gonna get away with it, do you?
You see?
Tony, you promised me and I promised you.
We wouldn't... You know, do the kind of stuff you did with Truck.
You remember how it used to be, when we thought it was all funny.
Like a game.
All the other kids thought we were some kind of freaks or witches.
I know, Tia.
We lost all of our friends until we quit doing all the spooky stuff.
You should've let Truck beat up on you.
Are you kidding? He's got five inches and 50 pounds on me.
Then you should've made it look like he was winning.
I suppose.
Tony?
Do you hear the dogs?
No. How far?
Oh, about 20 miles.
Big dogs, six or seven.
Yeah. I can hear them now.
That's awful far. Even for us.
Why are we hearing them, Tony?
I think it means that we're gonna see 'em someday.
If the bus is any later, Mrs. Grindley, we'll miss the beginning of the picture.
- Yeah.
- I'll see what's keeping them.
All right, Truck.
You guys, wanna see something really neat?
That's my star case, Truck.
And you're his sister.
Tony, please, not another fight.
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.
Give it back to Tia now.
I'll fight you with one hand.
I'll fight you with none.
Come on!
The bus is here.
Nice going, Winkie.
Hey, Tony and Tia, come on!
What's taking you? Come on!
Hurry up!
Tony, across the street!
Big car? What about it?
Something's going to happen to it.
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car.
There he is!
Come on!
Please, sir, don't get in that car.
It's no joke, sir.
See, my sister gets these feelings.
- So, you mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir.
Children, you know the rules about leaving the group.
No. I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- That's all right.
- Excuse us, please.
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.
The moon is moving into Aries.
Friday it will near the middle of the transit.
The bottom line, Mr. Michael-John.
The bottom line, Mr. Bolt, shows considerable indications of some advance toward your goals.
What about the house guru?
Do you concur, Ali?
There are profound vibrations, Mr. Bolt.
Are there indeed?
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.
Mysterious words and phrases have not added one red cent to my fortune.
Wealth, gentlemen, is like flesh.
It has to be nurtured and coddled.
Ah, Mr. Deranian.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bolt, but when you've heard my report,
I think you'll understand.
I have found what you're looking for.
Wait here a minute.
I haven't had a chance to thank you.
- Was the man in front all right?
- The chauffeur, yes. He's fine.
But then you knew he would be or you'd have had him get out of the car, too.
I suppose this sort of thing happens to you all the time, hmm, young lady?
Knowing about things before they really happen?
The lunch bell. We have to go.
Excuse me.
Those two children that just left.
I've been trying to think of their names.
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos.
Suppose somebody else had walked in?
Everybody knocks. Pine Woods' rules.
Look.
Must've happened when Winkie knocked it out of Truck's hands.
Can you fix it?
It's a map, isn't it?
"Stony Creek"?
"Misty Valley"?
It's funny, Tia, but every once and a while you get that look on your face.
Like you're remembering something.
I kind of do, but then I forget again.
It's not someplace big, like a state or a country.
But more like a road map.
I just don't know where.
When I can figure out where this place is, we'll go there.
Tony, what were you drawing?
It's the place where those dogs are.
They're barking now.
Yeah, I know. I was listening to them before you butted in.
I began to visualize this castle...
Tony, you can only visualize places we know something about.
Or places we're gonna be at.
I must've been drawing someplace we're going to.
Soon, Tony.
We're going there soon, and I'm afraid.
Since the Malones lived in a very small village,
I had little difficulty finding people who knew the children.
These insights, these sixth-sense incidents...
The postman, the schoolteacher, the woman who lost her parakeet, how do I know these aren't the result of your desperation?
Figments of your very fine imagination?
I have sworn affidavits.
People lie very easily. The very young can deceive the very wise.
I'm not lying.
If I'm in any way disappointed in this Tony and Tia, you are through here, Deranian.
Yes. I understand.
Then bring them here.
You say they have no family.
Well, now they do.
You are their family, Deranian.
You are their uncle, do you understand?
Perfectly.
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.
Whatever it takes. I will back you with every means at my disposal.
Just bring me the children.
I think there's no question, considering these documents your uncle has produced, that he has custody of you.
The judge signed those papers just today.
Mr. Deranian...
Uncle Lucas, Tony. Better get used to it.
Uncle Lucas, did you tell Mrs. Grindley about the first time we ever saw you?
Yes, he did.
The day the tow truck ran into your uncle's car.
That was a lucky day for all of us.
You see, Tia, you bear such a remarkable resemblance to Mr. Deranian's sister that he's convinced you both are her children.
My sister, your mother, died six years ago.
Now, if you have any doubts,
I'd be happy to show you these documents that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.
I won't have to leave Winkie, will I?
He's very smart and he knows how to deal with dogs.
Did I mention dogs?
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Grindley.
I'll see you out, Mr. Deranian.
Children, don't forget your coats.
Do you have any feelings about this Mr. Deranian?
Only that he isn't our uncle.
Must we leave, Tony?
That's what these papers mean.
We haven't got a choice.
It's all right, Lorko,
I'm just bringing through the children.
I'm sorry, but I'm allergic to cats.
Let us through.
Those are the dogs we heard.
There's the mansion.
Just the way you drew it, Tony.
Uncle Lucas, what's "Xzanthus"?
It's "Xanthus," Tony.
Mr. Bolt calls his house "Xanthus."
Who's Mr. Bolt?
Mr. Bolt is my employer.
And your host.
I have spacious apartments here.
And thanks to Mr. Bolt's generosity, they've been enlarged and redecorated to accommodate the two of you.
So, this is your long lost family?
You have a very beautiful niece, Deranian.
And a most attractive nephew.
You're Tony and you are Tia.
Here.
Our favorite flavors, vanilla and strawberry.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
After that long drive,
I'm sure you youngsters would like to see your quarters. Come with me.
Wow! It's beautiful.
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming.
Tony, look at that!
Hey, look!
Oh, wow!
Look at these dolls and stuffed animals.
Whoa!
Hey, Tony!
- When all this is completed...
- There's more?
Oh, yes!
We haven't had time yet to install the carousel or the gymnasium.
The tennis court's being resurfaced.
You can start your riding lessons first thing in the morning.
Oh, wow!
- We love horses.
- Oh, I forgot!
Winkie's private quarters.
Look, I think he likes it.
They're really great.
Of course, you still have your schoolwork.
Your tutors arrive the first of the week.
Mr. Bolt, where are the others?
- Other kids?
- Neighbors, I mean.
There are no neighbors.
Look out the window, go on.
Look as far as you can see.
Mr. Bolt owns everything in sight.
Well, I can see the sky.
I saddle him myself because this is your first time out, but one thing to remember, always mount a horse on his left side because...
Tia? You better pay attention or you'll be sorry.
Mr. Duncan, that horse over there.
That's old Thunderhead.
He's never been broke.
I don't envy the cowboy who'll try it.
I know it should be "ladies first," but I think if you show Tia how easy it is...
A little filly the size of your sister, sometimes they get scared.
Thunderhead, that's not nice.
My name's Tia.
And I want to be your friend.
All right, Thunderhead?
Tia! Stay away from him!
Hold on, now!
Good boy.
You know, I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
Tia! Come here.
Hey, Tony, why don't you try it without your harmonica?
I forget how.
Come to think of it, you can do a lot of things I can't.
Like working locks and the way you can talk to me without moving your mouth.
Maybe it's because you're a girl.
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.
Thank you, but we've a long way to go.
I'm having more hidden cameras installed and as soon as I have enough evidence,
I'm going to show the tapes to the children.
Good. If that doesn't put them on my team, then we'll have to resort to cruder methods of persuasion.
Tia?
Tia?
Tia, what's the matter?
Oh, everything and nothing.
I mean, maybe it's because we've gotten everything we've ever wanted.
More, even.
It's... I don't know.
It just doesn't leave us anything to wish for. Is that it?
I think so.
Tony, we've got to get out of here before it's too late, please.
- What do you see?
- Mr. Bolt, and he's mean.
He's never gonna let us go, Tony.
You're not always right about things like this.
I think this time...
This time...
You're right.
I've enjoyed this.
You should ask Uncle Lucas to arrange it so you can dine with me more often.
Thank you, Mr. Bolt.
We had some fine, stimulating conversation.
However...
Let us dispense with the kid gloves, and acknowledge the fact that we're dealing with two remarkable children.
Mr. Bolt, I really don't think you...
It doesn't matter what you think, Deranian.
If these youngsters are psychic, it's obvious they've begun to see through us by now.
- Don't lay all...
- You have power. I've seen it.
Now, I don't mean to ridicule those gifts of yours, as others might.
I revere them. Do you believe that?
What power do you mean, Mr. Bolt?
He knows. He knows all about us.
I don't think we know what you mean, Mr. Bolt.
What you did with Thunderhead and the marionettes.
And the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.
I want to know. I want to be able to understand these powers.
But that's impossible without your help.
You can make it possible.
You could walk across a field and tell where there's oil far beneath it.
You could foresee a revolution.
A natural disaster.
Please, Mr. Bolt, you're too excited.
You're going to make yourself sick.
You should go right to bed, sir.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
Anything.
Anything in this world you ask me for,
I'll bring you. Just never leave me.
Not another word. Into bed.
Uncle Lucas, you look like you could use some extra sleep yourself.
You heard what he said. He wants to learn all the things we know.
We couldn't teach him, even if we wanted to.
We... We don't know why we do all these things.
We don't know how it all started.
Tony, we've got to get out of here, please.
But to what, Tia?
Where do we go? Not to mention how.
The map.
- Mr. Bolt...
- Listen a second.
Don't lay all your cards on the table now.
They're very cunning.
I don't know the full extent of their powers.
Here they could escape.
But the chalet is an island in a sea of blinding snow.
They'll never escape from there.
Nutty as a fruitcake.
You see, we have to get out of here.
I know, but there's all that high fence
- and the guards...
- Children.
Finish up your ice creams and I'll show you to your bedrooms.
He's coming.
Come on.
So far, so good.
Come on!
Those dogs have ruined all my plans.
What do you mean, it's too late?
- Now!
- Dogs, stay.
Stay!
Good dogs.
There are some very bad men after us.
Go get 'em!
There's still the main gate.
They're not going to stop chasing us, even if we get past this gate.
Call Thunderhead.
Thunderhead, remember what I told you?
We're at the gate now.
- Lorko's on that lever.
- I'll help.
Winkie! Winkie!
Winkie!
Find them! I don't care how you do it.
Chase them on a magic carpet if you have to, but I want those kids back!
They rode out of here!
They're... They're quite a challenge.
I will not rest until I get those children back and neither will you.
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats.
Find them!
- You'll be all right here, big fella.
- Thank you, Thunderhead.
We'll miss you, Thunderhead.
Those sirens are for us.
We've got to keep moving. Come on.
They're getting closer.
Looks like you're taking a mighty long trip, friend.
Yeah, I figured I'd drive all over these United States.
Well, sir, a covered wagon pulling out of St. Joe didn't take near as much supplies as you got yourself here, Mr. O'Day.
You're sure one well-informed man, aren't you?
Now, do you think you could hand me that carton without straining yourself, or are you just tuckered out from sticking your nose in my affairs?
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.
Mister, if I did see 'em
I'd just as soon let 'em keep running.
As long as they're going opposite to where I'm headed.
Well.
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?
Hey, you're a friendly little fellow, aren't you?
Hey, I've got some canned tuna for you.
Hey, what are you doing here in my...
Uh, yesterday when I was loading supplies, they were looking for two kids.
Ah, a boy and a girl! You two.
Well, let's get one thing straight right here and now. I ain't no bus line.
And I ain't partial to hitchhikers.
And I don't like kids.
And what's more,
I'm a mean, impatient, selfish man, so come out of here and get on your way. Out! Out! Out!
Come on, out. On your way.
Wait a minute.
It ain't right for no human being to go hungry.
I'll make you some breakfast before you go.
Now don't get any ideas.
I got no patience with kids.
Especially runaways.
But it's just the opposite, sir.
We're trying to find where home is.
Excuse me, but did you see a black cat?
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?
Well, she's around somewhere.
Go on down to the water and clean yourselves off.
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.
You've got to be kidding.
Sorry, Mr. Deranian. No sign of them.
A grocer reported loading up one of these big campers, about the time they got away.
- They could have hidden in there.
- Any one of you spot a camper?
I let one go through.
The driver was alone.
Big fellow? Older guy?
A zip-up jacket with fair-colored hair?
That's the one. He was in a recreation vehicle heading north on highway L-38.
All right, north on highway L-38.
Now get out an APB on an RV heading north on L-38.
You see, Mr. O'Day, we don't expect to find our real parents, but maybe someone who knew them.
And can explain things to us.
We've got to make sure
Mr. Bolt and Deranian don't catch us.
Well, maybe that's the truth, and maybe it ain't.
But I'm not going to complicate things.
I'm gonna be on my way.
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had them in my...
I must have lost them out there.
You should have a spare key, sir.
I know that, young lady.
I am not a losing man.
Least not till you showed up.
Sir? Do you know a place called Stony Creek?
Stony Creek? Yes. Good fishing there.
- If we get the motor started...
- And clean up the back section...
Will you take us there?
Ah.
So that's it!
You're nothing but a conniving pair of undersized land pirates!
You swiped my keys to make sure you'd get a ride!
- Give me my keys.
- Sir?
The engine will start now.
All right.
You go back there and you clean up.
Make everything shipshape.
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.
You just remembered something.
It has something to do with the ocean.
Come on.
Go on back, clean up.
Let's get on the way.
Sure is a nice day.
Not with the prices you charge for gas.
Keep real still.
This fellow's acting mighty peculiar.
Nobody can know we're with you.
Maybe not. At least you'll be out of my hair by tomorrow.
We should make it to Stony Creek by then.
- How much?
- $10 even.
There you are.
Mr. O'Day? I think you bought too much.
Yeah, Winkie can't drink four quarts of milk between now and tomorrow!
Well, if you two weren't joshing me about Aristotle Bolt being after you, we might be together longer than we'd planned.
He's a powerful man, too po...
Motorcycle cop.
That attendant at the gas station.
You won't get in trouble, will you, Mr. O'Day?
It's not me he's after.
On second thought,
I might not drop you off too soon.
I might be able to squeeze an honest day's work out of you.
Take you fishing.
Deep-sea fishing, maybe.
Pit you two against half a ton of blue marlin.
Tia, what are you thinking about?
About before. It had to do with fishing.
- With Daddy Malone?
- No. No.
But we were on a boat.
A trawler.
Like Daddy Malone had.
That's all I remember.
Every law man in the county is probably looking for this camper.
There you are. Some hot chocolate?
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.
- What's that you have there?
- My star case.
Here. Let me show you what we found in the secret compartment.
- See where Stony Creek is, Mr. O'Day?
- Yes.
Well, there's a path that leads away from it. Up into some mountains.
We think that's where we may come from.
Somewhere in those mountains.
No, I don't think it was that way.
Not exactly.
There was an accident.
Well, go on!
I... It's gone.
What kind of an accident?
I don't know.
- In a car?
- No.
At... On the ocean!
Someone helped me save my star case.
Well, who?
Whoever put the map in the star case hid it so well, it took you all these years to find it.
That's right, Mr. O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe waiting for you to get old enough to do something about it.
Like now!
Very peculiar, huh?
I wonder...
I wonder how I'd handle you kids if you were mine.
Well...
Maybe that's why I never married, huh?
But, Mr. O'Day...
You were married.
What?
A long, long time ago.
And she was so pretty.
And you had a little house.
Yeah, I can see it.
It was white, with yellow shutters.
And there was a big elm branch over the whole roof.
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.
- What else?
- Well, your wife died.
Only a few months after you were married. And you were so sad.
You took an oath that you'd never give your love to another woman, or to anyone.
And you never have.
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Day.
The name's Jason.
If you know so dang much about me, you might as well use it.
- Jason, you understand?
- I like the name Jason.
We didn't mean to make you sad, Jason.
Come on. Are we going to dawdle here all night? Let's clean up here.
Get some sack time in.
We'll pull out of here a couple of hours before sunup.
They're headed towards Longview.
Do you understand that, Sheriff?
Mr. Deranian, $1,000 reward speaks mighty clear in these parts.
You can count on me.
- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- It's been a pleasure, a real...
A real pleasure.
Hey, Ubermann. Over there.
This time no mistake.
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.
My brother's house is about two miles outside of town up the north road.
His name is Hiram O'Day.
There's a car behind us, Jason.
Somewhere in Longview I'll find a place to make a fast turn and a quick stop.
You two jump out the side door and hide, you got that?
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie, now.
Yeah.
I'll keep going. If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.
You wait till he gets past.
Then we'll head for your brother's house, right?
Hiram O'Day.
Don't lose him.
Well, now! Welcome to Longview.
6:10 a.m. Okay, let's have your names.
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...
Castaway? That's no name, it's a word.
Your legal name is Malone, and don't go kidding me about that.
I think I'll let you see what lying to the law gets you.
Hmm.
In you go.
Tony, I've been thinking about why we would have said our name is "Castaway."
I think it might have something to do with us speaking another language.
- When the Malones took us in.
- Another language?
That's why we didn't talk for so long.
You mean we had to learn English?
We spoke a funny kind of language.
Uncle Bene spoke it to us.
Who's Uncle Bene?
I...
I think he died. Drowned.
What did he look like?
He had white hair...
I'll tell you, we don't want no panic around here, Sheriff.
Well, I've been in touch with Mr. Deranian and he's on his way.
I'll be home if you need me, Sheriff.
Tia, we've gotta think of something fast.
Hey, Tony, look.
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy.
Tia, we need my harmonica.
Now open the cell door.
When I get the star case, you run out to the edge of the woods.
As soon as I free the bear, I'll be there.
Tia, how do you expect us to get anyplace with a great big bear?
He's counting on me.
But this is an emergency.
Come off it, will you?
We still have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you start thinking about that?
Hey. Hey, what?
Get that thing off of me!
I just hope we don't have to pass a zoo before we get where we're going.
Look, I know what I saw!
And I say there's only one explanation!
Those two kids are witches!
And they're from Witch Mountain.
I want every available townsman to arm themselves, and we'll divvy up into hunting groups.
Hey, Sheriff. Whatcha gonna do, chase them all the way to Witch Mountain?
Yeah!
We'll stop them before they get there!
Now you listen close and I'll give you the areas to cover.
Those look like hunting parties.
They got away, Mr. Deranian, but we know what they are.
Evil itself. We got to catch them.
He's right. They're from Witch Mountain.
Sheriff, we need some more ammunition.
All right.
We'll get them, Mr. Deranian.
They've really got blood in their eyes.
There's no use trying to reason with them now, sir.
Security? This is Deranian.
I want a complete check on a Jason O'Day.
Tia, I know how you feel about the bear, and I think he's real neat too, but...
Well, a lot of people are gonna be looking for us, and he'll be safer on his own.
Anyway, they might shoot him.
Just for the sport of it.
Look.
He'll be safe there until tonight.
Then he can move on when it's dark.
Maybe you're right. I'll talk to him.
You be a good bear and wait in that cave.
We don't want anything to happen to you.
Tony, his feelings were hurt.
Watch it!
Jason!
Oh!
These woods are full of hunters looking for you. They think you're witches.
Brother Hiram ain't home, but I'll get you some food.
You'll have a good rest.
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day.
244 Cahill, just north of Longview.
Fifteen minutes.
We can be there in 15 minutes.
But I still can't figure out why we both came up with a name like "Castaway."
I noticed that you two are very smart for your years.
You really know what a "castaway" is?
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked and left on a desert island.
- Ah.
- Tony, I just remembered!
"Castaway." That's the name of someone we're supposed to see.
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing.
But suppose you two are castaways?
Then it would sure fit things Tia's been remembering.
Uh-huh.
We were in some kind of wreck, Jason.
And we were in the sea.
You mean like a boat sinking?
I guess. But if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.
We had an uncle.
Uncle Bene.
He kept us afloat. And then he drowned.
Oh.
For a long time we didn't understand anything anyone would say.
You must have come from some other country.
But we won't know all the truth until we get to the mountains above Stony Creek.
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.
My brother Hiram mentioned that place to me in his letters.
He said some strangers came and settled there, kept pretty much to themselves, and nobody ever knew where they came from.
You think they might be your people?
They must be!
Security? Have you notified Mr. Bolt of our destination?
Then do so.
We've just received communication from Mr. Deranian, sir.
He's on his way to a Mr. Hiram O'Day's cabin in the hills north of Longview.
- Don't just sit here, get going!
- Yes, sir.
Well, when Hiram gets home he's gonna find his cupboard is bare.
Gotta get going.
Come on, camper's out in back.
Tia!
Can you hear me?
We need another favor.
- Tia, come on.
- Come on, Tia.
There's no way we can get by them without their seeing us.
I remember more.
It wasn't just Uncle Bene who died in the ocean when our ship went down, a lot of other people died too.
And those people, the people that live here in these mountains, well, all of us came from the same country, but on different ships.
Why then now, you mean yours sank, and the others made it to port?
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place.
Yeah, a place that isn't there anymore.
Castaways?
That's why my people called themselves that, and...
And this was the emblem for where we used to live.
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.
It wasn't called that.
No. Two stars...
Because our world had two suns!
- Double stars!
- Another planet!
A whole other solar system!
Well, then... It wasn't a boat.
It was a spaceship!
Our planet was dying.
The only industry left was the manufacturing of spaceships.
Like ours.
And we had to find another planet to live on.
Then the other ships in your cluster landed here in these mountains, and yours didn't make it.
I think we might have been the only ones on our spaceship to have survived.
We lost them again.
We're going to go south on highway
211. Why don't you search the north?
Not too many people around, are there?
"Misty Valley Cooperative." This is it.
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.
We'll wait.
Are you the Longview bunch chasing after those two witch kids?
That's right, mister.
My name's Cort. You the guy's putting up the reward or what?
Yes, that's right.
Except that it's now $5,000.
- Five thousand, huh?
- But there's a catch.
I want those two children alive. I don't care what happens to the old man.
They were last seen in a camper headed this way.
Those words got a mighty good sound, friend.
Any idea where to look for them?
Well, they're not around here.
That's for sure.
Maybe the next town up the line.
Stony Creek?
Stony Creek?
We're changing course now.
They sure had time enough for a lunch break.
There's something to do with the phone book.
Let me have another look at that map.
Misty Valley Cooperative.
I was calling the Castaway family and I was wondering if...
It's all right.
Were you looking for Mr. Castaway?
Yes!
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!
- Is this Tony?
- Yes.
- Is Tia with you?
- Yes. Who is this?
Thank the blessed stars!
We've been searching for you for years.
Now listen carefully.
Everything must time out.
Take the back door and go to Mr. O'Day's camper.
Children, we want to make sure
Mr. Deranian doesn't lose you.
We have a plan that should discourage them from ever pursuing you again.
Come on! Come on!
Everything's all right, Jason.
You've got a funny idea of what's "all right."
Maybe Bolt can spot the RV from the helicopter.
Hey, men, come on!
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon. Headed north.
There's no way he can lose us in that monster he's driving.
Close in on them.
He's not exactly crawling.
They're getting closer, Tony.
Good driving, Al.
- How'd we wind up here?
- Another fine mess you...
- Come on, let's get out...
- Look out. The door!
Guys, let's go.
Very ingenious, Tony.
But don't forget, we want Deranian to see what's coming up.
I don't understand, sir.
Well, we have something planned that will convince Deranian and Bolt that you're both out of their reach forever.
Deranian, listen to me.
I spotted a route that lets you cut in ahead of them.
It's the second turn on the left.
Now signal the others not to follow you.
Repeat. Not.
Understood.
I don't believe it.
- It's what you call levitation.
- That ain't what I call it.
You two got powers beyond belief.
We're not doing this.
This is something too powerful for us to do.
Somebody else is making this happen.
Whoee!
That thing's flying upside down.
That's impossible.
That kind of vehicle can't fly upside down.
It's not supposed to fly at all.
They're not upside down. We are.
The voice says we should get out here and wait.
We'll never forget you, Jason.
Would you take care of Winkie?
Oh, no. Winkie's your cat.
It wouldn't be right for her to be with anybody else.
It would make us happy.
It sure would.
And I think Winkie would like it too.
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie how she feels about that.
Winkie, how do you feel about going around now with a crusty old man?
Look, if you don't mind...
I'd like to plan on, uh, remembering you two as if you were my kids.
The kids I never had.
Uncle Bene! Uncle Bene!
Uncle Bene!
Oh, you all did so well.
Congratulations, Jason O'Day.
You're a man of courage and compassion.
Uncle Bene, we thought you'd drowned.
Well, now if you know exactly what to say to a shark, he can be very accommodating.
Ah, Tia.
You never forgot.
You didn't lose the star case.
We only found the map a few days ago.
Well, I knew when you were old enough to understand it, you'd find it.
It's good to know that there are
Earth men such as you, Mr. O'Day.
If the stars are willing, perhaps some of the other children who survived will find men equally as kind.
- There are more?
- Yes.
All with star cases and maps.
So far, only Tia and Tony have found the way.
Well, now that I know what to keep my eyes peeled for, perhaps I could spot these surviving kids and bring them here.
Deranian's car.
I'll have to tend to Bolt's helicopter.
Stay and watch.
You'll see how we came into this world of yours.
What!
Stop this thing!
I'm all right! Where are the children?
I should've known there was more than ESP with those two.
Well, they're home now.
What is it?
What is that light?
I don't know.
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.
Chicken.
Holy mackerel!
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother Ship.
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
This is Mother Ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?
Affirmative, Mother.
Request repair party.
Negative, Zunar J5. You'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself.
And rendezvous with us at grid dissect
8304 at 69 hours minus 17.
- That's an awfully tight squeeze.
- Unavoidable, Zunar.
Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.
- Days?
- Years.
Good luck, Zunar J5.
Over and out.
Yeah. So long, Mother.
I don't see any hammer and sickle, do you, Colonel?
Maybe it's on the inside, General.
No sign of life, either.
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
I want to speak to the chiefs, Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Wipe it out of your minds.
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll want them later.
Take their names. Colonel.
Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Names?
- Charlie Cooney.
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.
- Bullhorn.
- Yes, sir.
On to Hopscotch.
All right, men.
Let's move it!
- Let's move out. Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
When we get to Hopscotch,
I want mark-four priority security.
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.
Not one word.
You got that, Colonel?
Yes, sir.
You got that, Captain?
- Yes, sir. Sergeant?
- Got it.
Well?
It's a brilliant technological achievement.
It's state of the art.
You trying to tell me something,
Allison?
- It's definitely not one of ours, General.
- How about Russia?
Certainly not Russia.
It's far beyond...
OK, Allison. Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?
I don't know, General.
We'd better find out. I wanna know who made it, flew it and where it came from.
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Contact SigCom on our radio.
Get Hungerford at Air.
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins,
Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.
- Get them IQs off their tennis courts.
- Yes, sir.
Double pronto!
If we don't find out where that thing came from, this country could be in trouble, big, big trouble.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
You say it's not man-made, Allison.
What's that leave us?
Outer space.
With no sign of the pilot.
Big, big trouble.
While you and I are talking this very minute, some slimy green-headed 12-legged creep could be crawling into the White House.
Big, big trouble.
We're up against genius.
We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
I believe, General, you've already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.
I'd like to introduce some members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.
Huh.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel. I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Oh, yes. This is our hard-water man,
Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie. The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist, who also is involved in Thermal.
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor
Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of Nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement and Supplies. What are you doing here?
When the call went out for an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong. Scientists.
Double-A clearance only. Out.
- But I might have a contribution.
- If we need any pencils, I'll send for you.
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.
Sorry, General. Where was I?
Oh, yes. Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come for a roll call,
I came to pick brains. Are they all here?
- Yes. These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
Dr. Link.
That's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input. Bye.
All right, Sergeant. Open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The United States government will countenance no leaks.
Now.
What's holding it up?
- Nothing.
- It's amazing.
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?
A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is, what makes it tick?
OK. Let's have your hypothesis.
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
- Checked out. Negative.
- Oh.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir. That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir. I think you'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
I don't know, sir, it's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?
Do you? Well?
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring
Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
- Wilson?
- Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool. Oh...
That is, we live in the same building.
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.
No.
What I'm trying to say is, he's a very bright young physicist who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.
- What?
- Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir, actually, in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream.
The primal mainstream?
It's everywhere, only on different frequencies.
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves.
Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
If I taped terminals to your head, General, your brain could run an electric train.
- Electric train?
- I'm sorry, General.
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt example.
Thank you very much.
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
- Yes, General?
- I want action.
You know, Drexel, I've seen the most amazing thing. Amazing.
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here? Huh?
Now look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name, huh?
Charlie? Cuddles? Jake?
Yes, yes. You look like Jake.
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And, one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like you know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this,
Sergeant. Easy, easy. That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle. She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz! Hi.
Ouch! I've...
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight.
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- I can wait.
That won't be necessary.
- How about a coffee?
- No.
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore? Sore?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it? What did I do?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that... that was just a joke, Doctor.
Well, nobody laughed, especially the general.
Has he had water?
- The general?
- The cat.
Oh. Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
A bowl? Right here, yes. Here.
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz... Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some general lacks a sense of humor, that's no reason...
- All I was trying to convey...
- I'm really not interested, Doctor.
Besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over.
- It did?
- Oh, completely.
- Black.
- What?
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right. Check. Coming right up.
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly...
- You read it?
- Well, of course. It was brilliant.
I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the car pool, but I've been following your work.
- You have?
- Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative, very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Oh, well, um,
I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism.
Oh. Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that. When?
- Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
That may not go all that late.
I should be out by seven. Is that too late?
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.
Well...
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
It was delicious.
- I think she digs you.
- I sure hope so.
- Who said that?
- I did.
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down. We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and you're the only one I can depend on to help me.
- It's you?
- It's not the mouse. Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference. Nothing exceptional where I come from. Now, sit.
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.
Zunar...?
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 13,
I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke... it's from my craft.
But... you're a cat.
Granted. But you see, in our civilization, that's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man rose off his four legs and developed tools, machinery, agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind. This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
- It does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
Not a bad little tune.
Mm-mmm.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
It really hits the spot. I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
- What do you say?
- Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
- Why me?
- Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me. In fact, they're really not bad at all... for a human.
- Really? I'm on the right track?
- Quite definitely, but years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression - you rub my fur, I'll rub yours.
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.
- You really are from outer space?
- I am from outer space.
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank! Is it a deal?
It's a deal. Oh, that's...
We better move. I've got to make repairs to my ship by 5:13 Sunday for liftoff, or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right. I'll get my sweater.
Uh, do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
- With the collar?
- Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.
Easy. Don't take it off.
Without it, I'm just an average cat.
Right.
- Right. OK?
- OK.
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me. I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank. Gotta use your set.
The ball goes crosscourt to Brown. He brings it...
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.
- Link, I'm busy.
- Yeah. Well, just forget I'm here.
The last minute of the game, and Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat. He's just visiting.
- Hi, Jake.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Remember. The score's tied at 108. Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it? Oh, man! And I gave a point and a half. There goes my 100 bucks.
Come on, defense. Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
The guy in the corner.
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball. What a play.
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer. There's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it. He scores!
He made it in the last second.
And the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I could use another beer.
- I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
- How about a ginger ale?
- I'm out of that, too.
- Could I at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.
I'd like to have a little celebration.
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
It was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Let's go.
It's less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right. Oh...
Do you think I ought to carry you, so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank. Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no. Polo.
Now let's go.
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.
- I'll handle that, too.
- It's fantastic.
Hi. Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle. I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
- At dinner?
- Yeah.
It was tonight, wasn't it?
Right. Right, yes.
I was just about to call you.
Something came up. I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Oh.
Oh, well, of course.
It really doesn't matter.
But it does.
It matters a lot, Liz. Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was...
It's Jake. He took sick.
Suddenly. Out of the blue.
Really? What is it?
I think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
- What?
- I said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet. That's a good idea, Frank.
D'you know there's a very good vet who lives in the building? A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I'm sorry about dinner. I'll make it up to you.
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?
- You handled that very well.
- I didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say. But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
Ohh...
- The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.
There's got to be a way in.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.
The coast is clear. Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- I know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
- Let's go!
- It's this way.
Forget it. It wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Now let's see about getting it operational again. We've only got 34 hours left.
Right. Through here?
Hm-hm. Put me down.
Oh, it's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh. Sort of.
- And this?
- Uh, computer.
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
- Fly.
- Fly? You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Concentrate, and when you get on top, engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project "seven max triad. "
- Seven max triad.
- Right. The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad. Right.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right. Go ahead.
- It's in.
- OK. Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
OK, Frank. Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that. The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
- You're sure?
- Positive. But I'll double-check.
- Just what I thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 12.
- What's org 12?
- What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 12 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back. I'll run it through the computer.
Hey, Tom! You all right?
Tom!
Org 12... ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point - 1.063.
Tensile strength - 19.000.
- Tensile strength what?
- 19.000.
Atomic weight - 196.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.
Wow!
Out! Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here! Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Come back here!
Where are you going?
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
Was anybody in there?
Back it out. Look out. Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat? Cat? Cat?
Yes, sir. Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Whoa!
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.
17 times...
Um, five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah. Uh...
This is even better than the stuff
I had last night. What's it called?
- Tuna.
- Tuna? Love it.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?
According to your figures, we're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.
- So?
- So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget, you know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system.
I'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties.
- How?
- I'll get into that later. First buy the gold.
Buy it? Jake, in order to buy $120,000's worth of gold, you need $120,000.
- So? Is that a problem?
- A prob...?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
- Then what's the alternative?
- I don't know what...
Hi.
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable TV schedule.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set, and the opera on mine.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?
- Link...
- Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
We've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
- Link, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
- Come on, Sweet Jake. Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?
Yeah. It's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, and I'm gonna be 1500 in front, and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already? Never mind, I'll get it.
- I'll try to get rid of him.
- Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said? If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.
- So?
- So if Link can win $1500, why can't we win 120,000?
No. Wait a minute. He just made a bet.
He could win 1500. It doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
- Did you say something?
- Hmm? No, nothing.
OK, OK. Let's pipe down.
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn. It's Denny's Doll by half a length. Attaboy Star.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind. But he's moving.
Uh-oh. I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Sweet Jake! I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby. Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And. Ladies and gentlemen. Is he running.
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead. Daddy's
Poppa moving into second. Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch. It's Booky Baby in the lead. Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home. It's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake. Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Attaboy. Here we go.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Jake.
Attaway. Come on, Jake.
Come on. Come on, boy! That's it! Hot dog!
We got it! Yahoo!
Yeeha!
The story here today.
Ladies and gentlemen. Is Sweet Jake.
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
- How about you? I'm buying.
- No, thanks.
Oh, incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
- No, no. It's ridiculous. It won't work.
- Why won't it?
I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets. The
Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?
- Link? Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise? Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!
- It's crazy.
- Buddy?
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West. Who?
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?
I don't think it's a good idea, but OK.
You know, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
- Link. Take a deep breath.
- OK.
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
- Spaceship?
... from another galaxy landed in a field.
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?
Now, you're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth?
- Is that it?
- That's right.
- You're squeezing.
- See? You heard him talk.
Uh-huh. Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer, watch three football games on your television set, and then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank. Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
I don't want to hear it, Frank!
- OK?
- OK.
Thank you.
That does it, Frank! I'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Oh, now, Link. We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet. I don't anything about...
What kind of a spaceship?
You're beautiful.
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking. What's your pleasure?
Yeah. Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- I say give him five.
The man says give him five.
You got it. Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
- Can I trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
- Hey, Ernie. Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet
Jake and parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah. It'll come to 120 G's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
- He's down.
- You're down.
Hold it right there.
General? General?
Fingerprints, sir. They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.
And they are the prints of a human being.
So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!
General!
- Look at this. They found more.
- What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
Even more important, we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.
Pussycat? Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks? What about the fingerprints?
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.
What do you want me to do with this?
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.
"ID - Wilson, Frank. Doctor.
Social Security, 631-07-0829."
"1951 to '55. US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech. "
"Current employment, theoretician. " ERL?!
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big, and this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him. To find the rat, tail the cat.
- Cat?
- It's just an expression.
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks. I'll wait till Frank gets back.
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead? The Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah. Coming right up.
There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 21- 19. Houston driving.
Another one in the bag.
- Come in.
- Frank?
Uh-huh?
Hi. Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
Oh, the picnic.
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh...
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?
- Jake's.
- Oh.
Yeah. Right.
I was up all night.
- Really?
- It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
- It's what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?
- What's that? What's happening, Frank?
- I don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.
OK. I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
- Hi, sweetie. Can I get you anything?
- OK. Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
You've got terrific whiskers.
Jake, will you pay attention? They're within field-goal range. If they make it, we're sunk.
No problem. Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
- Time out.
- I appreciate it, Doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over. I have $10 on Chicago.
- You've got it on. What's happening?
- Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
- How did they get to the 30?
- Interception.
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- ... or a field goal?
What do you think?
- I think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.
Hmm? Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.
OK. Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
This year. He's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
Block that kick. Block that kick.
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...
- It's right here, Frank.
- Huh?
- Give it to me, Liz. Give it to me.
- Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
- I'm gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap. It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough. It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it. The ball flattened out in midair. There's the gun.
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 21- 19.
I told you not to do that!
I only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.
Jake. Jake, it's me, Jake.
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose. And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous and my 1500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
- Liz, butt out.
- What?
- Cancel the bet. Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems. Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
The line is busy.
We'll never get through. He's taking bets.
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like... No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
- Later, Liz.
- No. Now.
We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
- Watch it, Link. I'm a black belt.
- OK. We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with
Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?
Outer space?
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no. Remember that artichoke?
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese. Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir. Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall. Looks like a Mafia tie-in.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
Really lucky.
Ernie? Ernie?
Excuse me. Ernie?
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here. Hiya, Doc.
Uh, Ernie,
I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really? Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.
Already?
16, boss, 16.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?
Well, there goes 120,000.
1500 of which is mine.
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out. Jake, wake up.
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.
OK. OK. Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah. Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?
- Hockey?
- Hockey.
Ernie, is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
- Demolition derby? Anything to get even.
- No.
But if you want a little action, there's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side.
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?
OK. It's a bet.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
- Right.
- Frank.
Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style, let's say 8 to 1.
That's all?
What about him?
- Me?
- Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in,
I'd say maybe 10 to 1.
- Ohh. What about the lady?
- Me?
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.
- OK. You got a bet.
- Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Are you bananas? That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer... the collar.
- How are you gonna do that? Jake's out.
- I've used it, to repair the spaceship.
- You?
- Yes. I've flown.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.
Throw in a few chilli peppers, huh?
- Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate. No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff. But...
But if we deliver, look what we get in return... the solution to half the problems on this planet.
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.
We need a stake. I've got about 12 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket. Will you get it for me?
- OK, that's 12. How much do you have?
- Me? I think I got 20.
- 20? Liz?
- Uh...
- I just have my mad money.
- Give it to us. Please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
- OK. Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.
- Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss? Do you mind?
We're waiting.
Now, that's a sandwich. Right?
Right.
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.
Nice break, young lady. Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,
but there's always tomorrow.
Show her how to do it.
OK, Slim, go get her.
Ooh, I can't watch this.
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out...
Frank! Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah. Where am I? What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
- No bet.
- No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city, he's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous. But if I didn't have no principles, I'd say 100 to 1.
Suppose... Suppose she gives
Sarasota Slim 12 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1.
- And the break.
- The break?
500 to 1.
And blindfolded.
- What?
- Blindfolded!
- 2,000 to 1.
- You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted.
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 12 balls and the break?
And she shoots blindfolded.
She'll never get to the table.
120 Gs, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice. Nice break, Slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
- I believe I'm up.
- Hold it. Blindfolded.
Oh.
Could you back off?
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
It was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won! Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, all of you. Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
It is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
Oh, my!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus.
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device, you may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Oh, sir, I... really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
OK. All set, General.
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
It is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man. Feed that information through again. Reassess.
Yes, sir.
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made... we checked it out. It's a large quantity of gold.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling
Dydee One. Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute. Radio.
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
$120,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune?
- I wish I could hang around.
- I'm sorry, Jake. The time?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
- I guess I'd better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?
- What are you talking about?
- It's a new concept in calculating mass.
On Jake's planet, they use a system based on content, rather than on the quantitative...
Frank! You've got a whole lifetime to explain that. I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
- All right, don't move! All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right...
- Good heavens.
- Frank...
- What happened?
- They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into
Hopscotch? You can't zap the whole base.
- Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.
First things first.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base. Now stand back.
OK. Here goes.
Ohh.
That is unbelievable.
Oh, Jake.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in. Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.
What does it all mean?
It means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese. Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
- Wait. Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.
- How do I look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?
- Do I look like a general?
- Oh, well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
- That'll have to do. Let's go.
- OK.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the general going with those two?
That's the general?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt! Halt in the name of the US...
Fantastic.
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah. Be careful.
- Bye, Lucybelle. Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
Bye.
- They've escaped?
- Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
- General Stilton?
- Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open. All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir. Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open. All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.
...to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
130 to countdown.
Hurry. Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
- Got it.
- Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!
OK, OK.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
Hi there. Fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
- We had problems.
- We are 105 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20. Set clinometer.
- Clinometer set. Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah. A real mother.
- I gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?
A friend of Frank Wil...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
- Them, too.
- Never mind. Let's get down to Hopscotch.
- Sergeant.
- Captain.
Colonel.
- General.
- Oh, get in!
- Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?
He's an agent for some guy named
Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
- Where is she?
- I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on
Earth. You're responsible to your mission.
- But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is? Let's go.
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
5. 4
3. 2.
Ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it. Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here. They've come.
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it. We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
It may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady's gone to the police.
Oh, dear.
You wouldn't dare?
Frank, that must be the chopper.
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
Watch it!
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.
But look who's arriving - the army and the police.
We have to follow that copter. What kind of an airport is this? Where are the planes?
Follow me.
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake. It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.
- Are you coming or staying?
- I'm coming.
I'm staying.
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous fran鏰is?
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
Uh...
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
- It's Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know what's good for you, you'll land...
- Quiet!
- OK.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance. It's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
Jake. Jake.
Jake! Jake.
Jake.
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake. Jake!
Jake. Jake!
Frank, are you OK?
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on.
Here they come.
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
Whoa!
I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out. Jake! Jake!
- Here they come again. Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake. Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Jake.
Oh, dear.
Jake.
Break off!
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls. They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute, either.
- Then you have a problem.
- I haven't got a parachute either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait! No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I d... I don't want to die!
Oh, swell.
Frank!
Frank!
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on.
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?
Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power, with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz. Don't panic.
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- I don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
- Careful, Frank!
- I got her.
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
Closer, Jake. Closer!
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!
Grab it! Liz, careful.
- OK.
- Now grab my hand. Grab my hand.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Good. That's good. That's good.
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?
- Liz!
- Huh? Ohh...
- Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
- All right. We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
OK. OK.
- Oh... Oh... Ohh!
- Whoa!
You see? Everything's gonna be OK,
Lucybelle. Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just... Huh?
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
- Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?
Fortunately, I never go anywhere without my Swiss Army knife.
Idiot!
All rise.
Hear ye.

This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?
Do you ask a fish how it swims?
Or a bird how it flies?
No, you don't.
They were born to do it.
Just like Willy Wonka was born to be a candy man...
...and you were born to be a Wonkerer.
Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two

Hi, Mr. Jopeck.
Come along, Charlie.
You're late.
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.
You're right.
- There you are.
- Thanks.
Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
Up the airy mountain...
...down the rushing glen.
We dare not go a-hunting...
...for fear...
...of little men.
You see...
...nobody ever goes in...
...nobody ever comes out.
Charlie's late.
He works too hard for a little boy.
He should have some time to play.
Not enough hours in the day.
With you four bedridden for 20 years...
...it takes work to keep this family going.
If only his father were alive.
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.
In all the years you've been saying that...
...I've yet to see you set foot on the floor.
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...
Hi, everybody!
Wake up, Charlie's home!
Grandpa George.
Grandma Georgina.
Grandma Josephine.
Grandpa Joe!
Is this your supper, Grandpa?
It's yours, too.
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!
It's all we have!
What are you saying?
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?
What difference does it make where? He got it.
My first payday.
Good for you.
We'll have a real banquet.
Mom?
Here's what's left.
You keep it.
Except for this.
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.
When bread looks like a banquet,
I've no right to tobacco.
Go on, Grandpa.
Please take it.
After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.
There was this strange man there.
I think he was a tinker.
He was standing behind me looking up at the factory.
Just before he left he said...
"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out. "
And right he was, Charlie!
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka locked it.
Why did he?
Because all the other chocolate makers were sending spies...
...dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.
Especially Slugworth.
That Slugworth was the worst!
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!"
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.
He locked the gates and vanished completely.
And then, suddenly, about three years later...
...the most amazing thing happened.
The factory started again, full blast!
And more delicious candies were coming out than ever.
But the gates stayed locked.
So that no one...
...not even Slugworth, could steal them.
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.
Thousands must be.
But who?
Who are they?
That is the biggest mystery of them all.
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?
I need an assistant.
Give me a hand.
We have nitric acid, glycerin...
...and a special mixture of my own.
Together it's dangerous stuff, blows you up.
But mixed together right, as only I know how, what's it make?
- I don't know.
- Of course not!
Because only I know.
If you knew, you'd be teaching me instead of me teaching you.
And for a student to teach his teacher is presumptuous. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Mixed together in the right way, these dangerous ingredients...
...make the finest wart remover.
The trick is to pour equal amounts.
Charlie, you take the nitric acid and glycerin...
...and I'll take my special mixture.
Ready?
Good lad. Pour.
Did we do it wrong?
Certainly not.
This is for big warts.
What's going on out there?
Come here! What's happening?
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!
Are you sure?
He's giving lots of chocolate away!
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for 5 people!
Class un-dismissed.
He hid 5 Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.
- Where'd he hide them?
- Inside 5 Wonka Bars, you must buy them.
Class re-dismissed!
Now, details of the announcement...
...that has captured the world's attention.
Hidden among the billions of Wonka Bars...
...are 5 Gold Tickets.
And to the 5 people who find them will come the most fabulous prize.
A lifetime supply of chocolate.
If this were not enough, each winner, before receiving his prize...
...will be personally escorted...
They're all crazy!
The man's a genius!
He'll sell a million bars.
Do you think I've got a chance to find one?
One?! I'm counting on you to find all five!
One's enough for me.
We have reports...
...the response is phenomenal!
Wonka Bars...
...are disappearing...
...at a rate to boggle the mind.
It is incredible...
...the way Wonkamania has descended upon the globe.
While the world searches, we watch and wait, wondering...
...where it will lead, and how long the spirit will hold up...
...under the strain.
I still have these dreams, Doctor,
And I still can't stop believing them.
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder...
...to believe in dreams is a manifestation of insanity.
The sooner you accept this, the sooner you'll get well.
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.
What did he say?
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.
- You said...
- Shut up and tell me where's the ticket!
We begin with 5 Golden Tickets.
Like 5 lucky bolts of lightning ready to strike at any point on the map.
No one knew where or when the first one would hit.
But last night we got our answer.
While America slept, the first Golden Ticket was found...
...in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.
We've been waiting for the story, and we're ready with a live report.
Proud we are, for the attention of the world...
...focuses today here in Duselheim.
A community thrust into prominence...
...by the discovery of the first Wonka Golden Ticket.
Its finder is the son of a prominent butcher.
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!
The pride of Duselheim, the fame of Western Germany.
An example for the whole world.
How does it feel to be the first Golden Ticket finder?
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...
Mrs. Gloop, would you say a few words to the audience?
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.
He wouldn't do it unless he needed the nourishment.
Happy birthday, Charlie!
Here you are, Charlie.
Thank you.
It's terrific!
We each knitted, Grandmas
Georgina, Josephine and me.
I did the end pieces with the tassels.
And here's a little gift from Grandpa George and me.
I think I know what this is.
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.
Let's see that Golden Ticket.
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- Don't raise his hopes.
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!
Stop it!
- I've got the same chance as anybody!
- You've got more.
You want it more.
Go on, open it!
Here goes!
- I got it!
- Where?
Let's see!
Fooled you, didn't I?
You thought I really had it.
Never mind, Charlie.
You'll find one.
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!
I wanted to find the first
Golden ticket, Daddy!
I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.
I've got every girl on staff hunting for you.
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!
Give me time!
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?
For five days now, the entire factory's been on the job!
They haven't shelled a peanut since Monday!
They've been shelling chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!
Work nights!
Come along, you girls!
Put a jerk in it, or you'll be out on your ears!
And listen: The first girl...
...that finds a Golden Ticket gets a bonus in their pay packet!
What do you think of that?!
They're not even trying!
They don't want to find it!
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.
19,000 bars an hour they're shelling!
760,000 they've done so far!
You promised!
You promised I'd have it the first day!
You're going to be very unpopular if you don't deliver soon.
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.
I won't talk to you!
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!
I won't go to school!
Veruca! Sweetheart! Angel!
There are only 4 tickets left in the world...
...and the whole world's hunting for them!
What can I do?
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!
About time, too! I want it!
Give me my ticket! It's mine!
I found the Golden Ticket!
Thank God!
Happiness is what counts with children.
Happiness and harmony.
This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...
...the mad craze that's sweeping the world.
Whatever corner of the globe we are in, whichever continent we're on...
...the great Wonka Bar search continues.
We're near the end...
...of our 43rd day in the Golden Ticket hunt.
Everywhere, are signs of anxiety.
Every hour...
...new shipments are sent around the globe.
But they're not moving fast enough.
And as time passes the men who seek them become more and more desperate.
Gentlemen, I know how anxious you've been during these last few days.
But now I think I can safely say...
...that your time and money have been well spent.
We're about to witness the greatest miracle of the machine age.
Based on the revolutionary law of probability, this machine...
...will tell us the precise location of the three remaining...
...Golden Tickets.
It says...
..."I won't tell.
That would be cheating. "
I am now telling the computer...
...if it will tell me the correct answer
I will gladly share with it...
...the grand prize.
He says...
..."What would a computer do with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"
I am now telling the computer exactly what he can do with the chocolate.
It can happen here, too, unbelievable as it sounds...
...right here in America.
Where even in the smallest town, the happiest dreams can come true.
Here she is...
...Violet Beauregarde, finder of Golden Ticket number 3.
From Miles City, Montana.
And the proud parents.
Mr. Beauregarde, a local politician, civic leader...
Sam Beauregarde,
Square Deal Sam to you...
...with great giveaway bargains.
The finest values in the entire country!
- Here's a sedan...
- Dad, they don't want you!
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure!
Here is Golden Ticket number 3, and it's all mine!
I'm a gum chewer, but when I heard about the tickets...
...I laid off gum and switched to candy.
Now, of course, I'm back on gum.
I chew it all day, except at mealtimes when I stick it behind my ear.
- Violet!
- Cool it, Mother!
This piece of gum I've been chewing for three months. A world record!
It beat the record held by my friend, Cornelia...
...and was she mad!
Hi Cornelia, sweetie!
Let me just say, if any of you folks watching...
- What are you doing here?
- I'll walk you home.
I'm not ready.
I'm going to be here late.
Then I guess I'll be going.
Why not stay a minute.
Pull up a pile of clothes and sit down.
School all right?
Yep.
Good.
Go on your newspaper route?
Just finished.
Good.
I wanted to tell you something.
They found the third ticket.
Did they?
I guess I'll be going now.
That's all?
I thought you'd like to know.
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.
There are only two tickets left, you know. Just two.
Pretty soon, just one.
I wonder who'll be the lucky ones.
If you're wondering, it won't be me.
If you're wondering, you can count me out.
There are 100 billion people...
...and only 5 will find Golden Tickets.
Even with a sack of money, you probably wouldn't find one.
When this is over you'll be no different from billions of others who didn't.
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.
When? When will they change?
Probably when you least expect it.
See you later.
You get blue like everyone
But me and Grandpa Joe
Can make your troubles go away
Blow away
There they go
Cheer up, Charlie
Give me a smile
What happened to that smile I used to know
Don't you know your grin
Has always been my sunshine
Let that sunshine show
Come on, Charlie
No need to frown
Deep down you know
The world is still your toy
When the world gets heavy
Never pit-a-pat 'em
Up and at 'em, boy
Some day...
...sweet as a song
Charlie's lucky day will come along
Till that day you've got to stay strong, Charlie
Up on top is right where you belong
Look up, Charlie
You'll see a star
Just follow it
And keep your dream in view
Pretty soon the sky is going to clear up, Charlie
Cheer up, Charlie, do
Cheer up, Charlie
Just be glad you're you
While the world searches...
...here it has actually happened.
There's only one Golden Ticket left in the entire world.
Because right here, in Marble Falls, Arizona...
...is lucky winner number four!
The name to be heard around the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee!
Can we shut that off?
- Are you crazy?
- He won't answer till station break.
The country wants to hear from you!
Can't you shut up?
I'm busy.
What a show!
I serve all his dinners here.
He's never been to the table.
- You love TV?
- You bet!
About that Golden ticket...
I want to catch this!
- Like killings?
- What do you think life's all about?
Mike, would you tell us if...
Wait till I get a real one.
Colt 45.
Pop won't let me have one yet, will you?
Not till you're 12, son.
Four down, one to go.
And somewhere out there another lucky person is moving closer...
...to finding the last of the most sought-after prizes in history.
Though we can envy him, whoever he is...
...and might be tempted to be bitter at our losing...
...we must remember there are more important things.
Many more important things!
Offhand, I can't think of what they are but I'm sure there's something.
Now for weather and...
Why did you wake me up?
Is something wrong?
Grandpa!
That money was for tobacco.
I've told you, I've given it up.
Go on, open it!
One ticket left.
Let's see that gold.
No, you do it. I can't.
We're going to be lucky this time.
I've got a funny feeling inside.
Which end shall I open first?
That end. Just a tiny bit.
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.
- You finish it! I can't.
- No, Grandpa! You do it.
All right.
Here goes.
You know...
...I bet those Golden Tickets make the chocolate taste terrible.
Lot 403.
I can personally guarantee...
...that this is the absolutely last case of Wonka Bars...
...left in the United Kingdom.
Shall we start the bidding at
1,000 pounds? Do I hear 1,000?
1,500 pounds?
I have 2,500.
4,500 pounds?
Your Majesty!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.
There isn't anything to give us a clue.
They kidnapped my husband
12 hours ago.
When will we hear?
What do they want?
Stay calm. They want ransom.
We wait to hear their demands.
I'll give them anything they want.
All I want is Harold back!
Go ahead, we're listening.
Whatever they asked for they can have it.
They want your case of Wonka Bars.
Did you hear me?
It's your husband's life or your Wonka Bars.
How long do I have to think it over?
That's it!
The Wonka contest is all over.
The final ticket has been found...
...we've got a live report in from
Paraguay, South America.
It is finished.
The end has come.
The last Golden Ticket has been found...
...right here in Paraguay.
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta...
...the millionaire owner of South America gambling casinos.
Here is the most recent picture of the happy finder.
Turn it off!
Well, that's that.
No more Golden Tickets.
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.
A boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?
Who's going to tell him?
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.
Yeah, let him sleep.
Let him have one last dream.
I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.
Which means Friday's test on what we learned during the week...
...will now be Monday before we've learned it.
Since today's Tuesday, it doesn't matter.
Pencils ready!
Today, we are going to learn about...
...percentages.
For example, let's take the recent unpleasantness.
Suppose there are
1,000 Wonka Bars in the world...
...and you each opened a certain number of them.
That number is...
...a percent. Understand?
Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?
About 100.
There are ten 100's in 1,000, therefore, you opened 10 percent.
Peter Goff, how many did you open?
10% half over again, which makes
15 percent. Charlie Bucket!
- How many did you open?
- Two.
That's easy. 200 is twice...
Not 200.
Just 2.
What do you mean, you only opened 2?
I don't care much for chocolate.
I can't figure out just 2!
Let's pretend you opened 200.
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars, apart from being dreadfully sick...
...you'd use 20% of 1,000...
...which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent...
I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.
Why, sure.
What kind?
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious?
- Whichever's biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious.
Now that the tickets are found,
I don't have to hide them.
Take it easy!
You'll get a stomach ache.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, now.
I think I'll buy just one more, for my Grandpa Joe.
Sure.
Try a regular Wonka Bar.
Fine.
- Take it easy! One at a time!
- Did you hear the news?
That gambler from Paraguay made a phony ticket.
There's one Golden Ticket still floating around.
The nerve of that guy!
Trying to fool the world!
He was a crook! This means the contest goes on forever.
You got the last Golden Ticket!
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!
Stand back!
Leave the boy alone!
Break it up!
Charlie! Hold onto that ticket!
Run for it! Run straight home!
Don't stop till you get there!
I congratulate you.
Well done.
You've found the fifth Golden Ticket.
May I introduce myself?
Arthur Slugworth.
President of Slugworth Chocolates.
Listen carefully, because
I'm going to make you very rich.
Mr. Wonka is working on a fantastic invention.
The Everlasting Gobstopper.
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.
I want you to get just one
Everlasting Gobstopper...
...and bring it to me so I can find the secret formula.
Your reward will be...
...10,000 of these.
Think it over, will you?
A new house for your family...
...food and comfort for the rest of their lives.
And don't forget the name...
...Everlasting Gobstopper.
I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.
The last one's fake!
It's in the paper!
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar and the ticket was in it!
Look at it! See for yourself!
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket...
"... from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present this ticket at the factory gates...
"... at 10 o'clock in the morning,
October 1st, and do not be late!"
"You may bring with you one member of your own family, but no one else.
"In your wildest dreams you could not imagine...
"... the marvelous surprises that await you!"
You've done it!
It says I can take somebody with me.
I wish you could go.
Charlie!
That's good, Charlie.
Now help me up.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, Charlie.
Watch it, Joe!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Up and about!
I haven't done this in 20 years!
I never thought my life could be
Anything but catastrophe
But suddenly I begin to see
A bit of good luck for me
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a golden twinkle...
...in my eye
I never had a chance to shine
Never a happy song to sing
But suddenly half the world is mine
What an amazing thing
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
It's ours, Charlie!
I've got a golden sun up in the sky
Slippers, Charlie!
I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say
Good morning
Look at the sun
I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done
But it can be done
The cane, Charlie!
Here I go!
Watch my speed!
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But nevertheless it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a golden chance to make my way
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day
Good morning! Look at the sun!
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done
But it can be done
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But, nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a golden chance to make my way
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day
Stop! It says the first of October.
That's tomorrow.
We've got a lot to do! Comb your hair, wash your face, polish your shoes...
- I'll take care of everything.
- We don't have much time.
Grandpa... on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!
How do I look?
- You guys ready?
- You're on.
This is the big day.
The day Willy Wonka will open his gates and shower gifts on the 5 lucky winners.
From over the globe, people have gathered, waiting for the hour...
...to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.
Hi, friends! Don't forget to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...
Cut it out, Dad!
This is my show!
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?
I want to go in first, before anybody.
Anything you say.
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.
To see the greatest of them all,
Mr. Willy Wonka!
Thank you.
Welcome, my friends.
Welcome to my chocolate factory.
Would you come forward?
Get back!
Come on, Veruca!
That's Slugworth, the man I told you about.
Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.
I'm so glad you could come.
This is going to be such an exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.
I think you will.
Please show me your Golden tickets.
I'm Veruca Salt.
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!
You look pretty in that mink coat!
I've got three others.
Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?
Augustus Gloop.
Augustus, my dear boy!
Good to see you, and in such fine shape!
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.
What kind of gum you got?
Charming!
Sam Beauregarde here!
What a genuine pleasure.
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"
I'm Mike Teevee.
Wham, you're dead!
Wonderful to meet you!
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.
Charlie Bucket.
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who's this?
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.
Delighted.
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.
Are we ready?
Yes! Good!
In with you!
Hats, coats, galoshes over here.
Hurry, we have so much time and so little to see.
Wait a minute! Strike that.
Reverse it. Thank you.
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.
Boy, what weird coat hangers!
Surprises around every corner, but nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.
As soon as your outer vestments are in hand...
...we'll begin.
Now...
...will the children kindly step up here.
Accidents? What kind of accidents?
I didn't know we had to sign anything.
I can't read the bottom.
Violet, you first.
Sign here.
Hold it!
Let me through.
Don't sign anything.
What's this about?
Standard form of contract.
Don't talk contracts, I use them myself.
They're for suckers.
You wouldn't begrudge me a little protection? A drop?
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.
I'm sorry. House rules.
- I want to go in. Don't try to stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.
Nicely handled! She's a girl who knows where she's going.
What's all that small print?
Any problems? Dial Information.
Thanks for calling.
I assume there's an accident indemnity clause?
Never between friends.
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed his wife's insurance policy.
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.
What about me, Grandpa?
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.
Let's go in! Come on!
Patience.
Everything has to be in order.
Everyone signed? Yes?
Good. On we go!
Ninety-nine...
...forty-four...
...one hundred percent pure.
Just through the other door, please.
There's some mistake here.
There is no other door.
There's no way out!
I know there's a door here someplace.
I don't like this, Wonka!
Is this a trick?
Mr. Wonka, help!
I'm getting squashed!
Save me!
Is it my soul that calls my name?
Let me out or I'll scream!
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!
Question time will come at the end of the session. We must press on.
- Here we are.
- Don't be a fool.
That's the way we came in.
It is? Are you sure?
We've just come through there.
How do you like that?
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka?
A funhouse?
Why? Having fun?
I'm not going in there.
We're getting out of here.
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.
Better press on.
- The room is getting smaller.
- No, it's not!
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.
You can't squeeze me through that door.
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.
My dear friends...
...you are now about to enter the nerve center...
...to the entire Wonka factory.
Inside this room, all of my dreams become realities.
And some of my realities become dreams.
And almost everything you'll see is eatable... edible.
I mean, you can eat almost everything.
Let me in, I'm starving!
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.
We wouldn't want to lose that.
Yet.
Now, the combination.
This is a musical lock.
Rachmaninoff.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...boys and girls...
...the Chocolate Room.
Hold your breath. Make a wish.
Count to three.
Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look
And you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin
With a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world
There's nothing to it
Hurry, Violet!
This way, Grandpa!
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there
You'll be free
If you truly wish to be
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world
There's nothing...
...to it
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there
You'll be free
If you truly...
...wish to be
What a disgusting, dirty river!
It's industrial waste.
A ruined watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.
It's chocolate.
That's chocolate?
That's chocolate.
A chocolate river.
The most fantastic thing I've ever seen.
10,000 gallons an hour.
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.
No other factory in the world mixes chocolate by waterfall.
But it's the only way if you want it just right.
Grandpa, look over across the river!
Little men!
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!
Now we know who makes it.
I never saw anybody with an orange face before.
Funny looking people.
What are they doing?
Creaming and sugaring time.
- They can't be real people.
- Of course, they're real people.
Nonsense!
No, Oompa Loompas.
From Loompaland.
Loompaland?
There's no such place!
Excuse me, dear lady...
I teach geography.
Then you know all about it.
And what a terrible country it is.
Nothing but desolate wastes and fierce beasts.
The poor little Oompa Loompas were so small and helpless...
...they would get gobbled up.
A Wangdoodle would eat ten of them for breakfast.
And so I said...
"Come and live with me in peace and safety...
"... away from all the Wangdoodles and Hornswogglers...
"... and Snozzwangers and rotten Vermicious Knids. "
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?
I'm sorry, questions must be submitted in writing.
So, in the greatest of secrecy...
...I transported the entire population of Oompa Loompas here.
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!
All right, I'll get you one before the day's out.
I want an Oompa Loompa now!
Can it, you nit!
This is terrific.
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.
Augustus, sweetheart, save some room for later.
Don't do that! My chocolate must never be touched by human hands.
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!
Please, I beg you!
Augustus!
My chocolate!
Help!
My chocolate!
My beautiful chocolate!
Don't just stand there!
Do something!
Help. Police. Murder.
Grab this!
What's happening to him?
- Looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!
- Save him!
- It's too late.
- Too late?
- He's had it now.
- The suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back!
Where is he?
Watch the pipe.
How long is he going to stay down?
- He can't swim!
- No better time to learn.
His coat's going up the pipe!
Call a plumber!
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?
It's his stomach.
- He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.
I wonder how long it's going to take?
The suspense is terrible.
I hope it'll last.
He'll never get out.
Yes, he will.
Remember you once asked me how a bullet comes out of a gun?
He'll be marshmallows in 5 seconds!
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?
Because that pipe goes to the Fudge Room.
You terrible man!
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room, but look sharp...
...or her boy will get in the boiler.
You boiled him up!
Nil desperandum. Across the desert lies the promised land.
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got a perfect puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
What do you get when you guzzle down sweets?
Eating as much as an elephant eats
What are you at getting terribly fat?
What do you think will come of that?
I don't like the look of it
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
If you're not greedy, you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do
What kind of place you running here?
What's he talking about?
Wow, what a boat!
Looks good enough to eat!
That's a nice little canoe.
"All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. "
All aboard!
Ladies first.
That means Veruca.
If she's a lady,
I'm a Vermicious Knid.
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.
She's très jolie, but is she seaworthy?
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.
- You took good care of that August kid.
- Everybody aboard!
You're going to love this.
Just love it.
I want a boat like this. A beautiful paddle boat, that's what I want.
What she wants is a kick in the pants.
I'm going to be seasick.
- Try one of these.
- What are they?
Rainbow drops.
You can spit in 7 colors.
Spitting's a dirty habit.
I know a worse one.
- What business are you in?
- Nuts.
Where are we going?
I don't like that tunnel.
I want off!
Around the world and home again.
That's the sailor's way!
I don't like this ride, Daddy!
We're going too fast!
We're going to sink!
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?!
- Faster!
Close your eyes and hang on tight!
- What is this, a freak-out?!
- This isn't funny!
You can't possibly see where you're going!
You're right. I can't.
This would make a great series!
- This is kind of strange.
- Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun!
I want to get off the boat, Wonka!
I may get sick!
This is going too far!
Tell that little guy to turn us around!
Now I am going to be sick!
There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing
Is it raining
Is it snowing
Is a hurricane a-blowing
Not a speck of light is showing, so the danger must be growing!
Are the fires of hell a-blowing?
Is the grizzly reaper mowing?
Yes!
The danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing!
And they're certainly not showing...
...any signs that they are slowing!
Make him stop, Daddy!
- This has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir.
Stop the boat!
- We're there.
- Where?
Here.
A small step for mankind, but a giant step for us.
All ashore!
Let me off this freight!
- Why don't they show that stuff on TV?
- I don't know.
What a nightmare!
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.
"Dairy cream. "
"Whipped cream. "
- "Coffee cream. "
- "Vanilla cream. "
"Hair cream?"
That's not French.
I can't take much more.
The Inventing Room.
Now remember, no messing about.
No touching, no tasting, no telling.
No telling what?
All of my most secret inventions are cooking and simmering in here.
Old Slugworth would give his false teeth to get inside for five minutes.
So don't touch a thing!
Inventing room?
Looks more like a Turkish bath.
Even if Slugworth did get in here, he couldn't find anything.
- You got a garbage strike?
- Who does cleaning?
Shouldn't you wear gloves?
You'll have health inspectors after you.
Invention, my dear friends, is 93% perspiration...
...6% electricity...
...4% evaporation...
...and 2% butterscotch ripple.
That's one hundred and five percent!
Any good?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Time is a precious thing.
Never waste it.
- He's absolutely bonkers!
- That's not bad.
In springtime
The only pretty ring time
Birds sing
Hey, ding a ding-a-ding
Sweet lovers love...
...the spring
I told you not to, silly boy.
Your teeth!
Boy, that's great stuff.
That's exploding candy, for your enemies. Great idea.
Not ready yet.
Needs more gel ignite.
What's that for?
Gives it a little kick.
Wonka!
Butterscotch? Buttergin?
Something going on inside?
"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker. "
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?
Too cold! Far too cold.
That's gourmet cooking for you.
No! Don't, please.
Forgive me, but no one must look under there.
This is the most secret machine in my factory.
- This one's going to sizzle Slugworth.
- What's it do?
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah!
What's it do?
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.
Everlasting Gobstoppers?
For children with little pocket money.
You can suck them forever.
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!
- Me, too!
- And me!
Fantastic. Revolutionize the industry.
You suck them and they'll never get smaller. Never...
...I think.
- Few more tests.
- How do you make them?
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! Me! I do!
I can only give them to you if you swear to keep them for yourselves.
And never show them to another soul as long as you live.
Agreed?
Agreed!
Good. One for you, and one for you, and one for you.
What about Charlie?
And one for Charlie.
Hey, she's got two!
I want another!
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has one.
And one is enough for anybody.
Now, come along.
If you'll follow me...
...I have something special to show you.
It's special, all right.
I only hope Veruca doesn't want one.
What a contraption!
Isn't she scrumptious?
My revolutionary, non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.
Button, button, who's got the button?
It's over there.
- Here?
- Yeah.
What you are witnessing, dear friends...
...is the most enormous miracle of the Machine Age.
The creation of a confectionery giant!
- Finito!
- That's all?
Don't you know what this is?
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!
It's the most fabulous, sensational gum in the world!
What's so fab about it?
- This piece of gum is a 3-course dinner.
- Bull!
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.
If it's gum, that's for me.
Violet, don't do anything stupid.
What's it taste like?
Madness! It's tomato soup!
It's creamy. I can feel it running down my throat!
Stop. Don't.
Why doesn't she listen?
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.
Great soup!
The second course is coming.
Roast beef and a baked potato!
With sour cream?
- What's for dessert?
- Dessert? Here it comes!
Blueberry pie and cream! It's the most marvelous pie I've ever tasted!
- What's happening to your face?
- Cool it!
Let me finish.
You're face is turning blue!
- You're turning violet, Violet!
- What do you mean?
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.
Look what it's done to my kid!
It always goes wrong when we come to the desserts. Always.
What are you doing!
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?!
- You're like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.
- Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!
- They all become blueberries.
- You've done it this time!
I'll break you for this!
I'll get it right in the end.
Help!
We've got to let the air out of her!
There's no air.
- That's juice.
- Juice?
Would you roll her down to the juicing room?
- What for?
- For squeezing.
She has to be squeezed before she explodes.
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got another puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
Gum chewing's fine
When it's once in a while
It stops you from smoking
And brightens your smile
But it's repulsive
Revolting and wrong
Chewing and chewing
All day long
The way that a cow does
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
Given good manners
You will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do
I'll get even with you for this, if it's the last thing I do!
I got a blueberry for a daughter!
"Where is fancy bred?
In the heart or in the head?"
Shall we roll on?
Thank you.
Well, well, well!
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.
Three good, sweet little children left.
Hurry, please.
Long way to go yet.
Wait a minute.
Must show you this.
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.
Lick an orange or pineapple.
It tastes like them. Try it!
I got a plum!
Grandpa, this banana's fantastic!
It tastes so real!
Try some more. The strawberries taste like strawberries.
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?
We are the music makers.
And we are the dreamers of dreams.
Come along.
Something very unusual in here.
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere, but not a drop to drink.
Yet.
What's it making?
Fizzy-Lifting drinks. They fill you with gas and the gas lifts you...
...off the ground like a balloon.
Isn't it high?
But it's still too powerful.
Let us try some!
No, no. There'd be children floating all over the place!
Come along, don't hang about.
You'll be wild about this next one.
Let's take a drink.
No one's watching.
A small one won't hurt us.
Not bad.
Well?
Nothing's happening.
You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why!
I feel terribly strange.
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie!
- Mr. Wonka isn't going to like this!
- We can't stay up here all day!
- You're right, but...
- I'll try and get down.
All right, Charlie, but, please, be careful.
It's fun! It works!
Come on in! The air's fine!
- I haven't swam in 20 years.
- Give me your hand!
I don't think I ought to.
This is great!
Try this, Grandpa!
All right, Charlie.
Wait for me!
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!
This is really great!
Look, I'm a bird!
I feel light as a feather.
Look down.
We're really high now.
Watch this, Grandpa.
Wonderful, Charlie!
- Try it, Grandpa!
- I don't know!
Come on, Grandpa!
All right.
Hey, you did it, Grandpa!
I hit an air pocket.
You can fly to the moon this way!
Let's fly south for the winter.
Why not?
I'm a bird!
I'm a plane!
I'm...
...going too high!
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!
Help!
Grandpa, the fan!
It’ll chop us to bits!
We're in trouble!
I can't stop!
It's pulling me in!
I can't stop!
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something!
There's nothing to grab onto! Help!
We'll be killed!
Help! Help!
Mr. Wonka, please!
Turn off the fan!
I'm going down!
Burp! If you don't, it'll cut you to ribbons!
- I can't! Help!
- You've got to burp!
It's the only way!
That-a-boy! Burp again!
That-a-boy! Come on!
That's wonderful, Charlie!
Grab on.
We're going to be all right.
Good boy!
From now on we keep our feet on the ground.
Let's catch up to the others!
I know what you're thinking.
They can't be doing that.
But they are. They have to.
The Oompa Loompas can't do it.
The geese that lay the golden eggs!
They're larger than ordinary geese.
They're quadruple-size, which produce...
...octuple-size eggs.
They're laying overtime for Easter.
But Easter's over!
They don't know that.
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.
What if they drop an egg?
An omelet fit for a king, sir.
Are they chocolate eggs?
Golden chocolate eggs!
A great delicacy.
But don't get too close.
The geese are temperamental.
So we have the Eggdicator.
The Eggdicator tells the difference between a good egg...
...and a bad egg.
If it's good, it's shined and shipped over the world.
If it's a bad egg...
...down the chute.
An educated Eggdicator.
It's a lot of nonsense.
A little nonsense now and then...
...Is relished by the wisest men.
I want a golden goose!
Here we go again.
All right, sweetheart.
You'll get one as soon as we get home.
No, I want one of those!
How much do you want for the goose?
- Not for sale.
- Name your price.
She can't have one.
Who says I can't?
- The man with the hat.
- I want one!
I want a golden goose!
Gooses!
Geeses!
I want my geese to lay gold eggs for Easter.
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least 100 a day.
- Anything you say.
- And by the way!
I want a feast.
You ate before you came.
I want a bean-feast
One of those.
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts
- So good you could go nuts
- You'll have it when you get home.
No, now! I want a ball!
I want a party
Pink macaroons
And a million balloons
And performing baboons and...
...give it to me
Now!
I want the world
I want the whole world
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
Give it to me now
I want today
I want tomorrow
I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair
And I don't want to share them
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter
10,000 tons of ice cream
And if I don't get the things I am after
I'm going to scream
I want the works
I want the whole works
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises
Of all shapes and sizes
And now
Don't care how
I want it now
Don't care how
I want it now
She was a bad egg.
Where's she gone?
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.
The garbage chute!
Where does it lead to?
To the furnace.
The furnace?
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.
She could be stuck inside the tube.
Hold on!
Veruca! Sweetheart!
Daddy's coming!
There'll be a lot of garbage today.
Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.
Mr. Wonka, they won't really be burned in the furnace, will they?
I think that furnace is lit only every other day.
So they have a good sporting chance.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got another puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
Who do you blame
When your kid is a brat
Pampered and spoiled
Like a Siamese cat
Blaming the kids
Is a lie and a shame
You know exactly
Who's to blame
The mother and the father
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
If you're not spoiled
Then you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do
The children are disappearing like rabbits!
We still have each other.
Shall we press on?
Can't we sit down for a minute?
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.
Behold the Wonkamobile!
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever. "
Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.
Grab a seat, they're going fast!
What's that they're filling it up with?
Ginger ale, ginger pop, ginger beer, beer bubbles...
...bubble cola, double cola, double-bubble burp-a-cola...
...that carbonated stuff that tickles your nose.
Few people realize the power in one of those things.
I'm sorry I asked.
Would Slugworth pay extra to know about this?
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
Everybody set?
Will this go fast?
It should. It's got more gas than a politician!
Hold on. I'm going to open her up and see what she can do.
Swifter than eagles...
...stronger than lions.
It's getting in my eyes!
It's seeping in my shoes!
I'm soaked!
It’ll never come out!
It's sticking to my gun!
My dress! My hair! My face!
I'm sending you the cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka!
I'm dry cleaned!
Hey, Grandpa...
...what was that we just went through?
Hsaw Aknow.
- Is that Japanese?
- No, Wonka Wash spelled backwards.
That's it. The journey's over.
Finest bath I've had in twenty years!
Let's do it again!
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?
If the Lord meant for us to walk
He wouldn't have invented roller-skates.
Would you put these on?
We have to be careful.
There's dangerous stuff inside.
Wonkavision!
My very latest and greatest invention.
- It's television!
- It's Wonkavision.
You all know how ordinary television works.
I do! You photograph something...
...then it's split into millions of pieces...
...that fly through the air and arrive at your TV set in the right order.
You should open your mouth a little wider when you speak.
If they can do it with a photograph...
...why not a bar of chocolate?
I shall now send this chocolate bar from one end of the room to the other.
It has to be big, because when you transmit by television...
...it always ends up smaller.
Goggles on, please.
Lights... camera...
...action!
You can remove your goggles.
Where's the chocolate?
It's flying over our heads in a million pieces.
Now watch the screen.
Here it comes.
There it is.
Take it.
How? It's just a picture.
All right, you take it.
It's real!
Taste it!
It's just gotten smaller.
It's perfect!
Unbelievable!
A miracle!
A TV dinner!
It's Wonkavision.
It could change the world!
Can you send other things?
- Not just chocolate.
- Anything you like.
What about people?
People?
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.
But it might have messy results.
I'm going to be the first person to be sent by television!
Get away!
Stop. Don't. Come back.
Lights... camera... action!
Where are you?
He's up there, in a million pieces.
- Mike, are you there?
- No good shouting. Watch the screen.
Mike? Why is he taking so long?
A million pieces take time to put together.
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...
The little groover's getting smaller.
Look at me! I'm the first person in the world to be sent by television!
Wow, what a wild trip that was!
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened!
Am I coming in clear?
I said, am I coming in clear?
Great. He's completely unharmed.
You call that unharmed?!
Wow! That was something!
Can I do it again?
There'll be nothing!
Don't worry, Mom.
I feel fine.
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!
Wait till the kids hear!
No one will hear!
Where are you taking me?
I don't want to go in there!
Be quiet!
Well?
Fortunately, small boys are extremely springy and elastic.
So, I think we'll put him in my special taffy-pulling machine.
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.
The boy is in his mother's purse.
But be careful.
What's he saying?
No, I won't hold you responsible.
And now, my dearest lady, it's time to say good-bye.
No, no! Don't speak!
For some moments in life, there are no words. Run along now.
Adieu.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow. "
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got another puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
What do you get from a glut of TV?
A pain in the neck and an IQ of 3
Why don't you try simply reading a book?
Or could you just not bear to look?
You'll get no
You'll get no commercials
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
If you like reading you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the...
...Oompa...
...Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do!
So much to do, so much to do.
Invoices, bills, letters.
I must answer that note from the queen.
What will happen to the others?
My dear boy...
...they'll be quite all right.
When they leave here they'll be restored to their normal, terrible old selves.
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.
Don't worry.
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.
Up the stairs. I'm busy.
A whole day wasted.
Good-bye to you both.
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?
I don't know, Charlie.
But I'm going to find out.
I am extraordinarily busy, sir.
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.
When does he get it?
- He doesn't.
- Why not?
Because he broke the rules.
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?
Wrong, sir! Wrong!
Under Section 37-B of the contract signed by him...
...it states clearly that all offers shall become null and void if...
...and you can read it for yourself in this copy:
"I, the undersigned...
"... shall forfeit all rights, privileges and licenses...
"... herein contained," et cetera...
"... fax mentis...
"... incendium gloria culpam," et cetera, et cetera.
"Memo bis punitor della cattum!"
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as crystal!
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!
You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be sterilized!
So you get nothing!
You lose!
Good day, sir!
You're a crook!
A cheat and a swindler, that's what you are!
How can you do this?!
Build up a little boy's hopes and then smash his dreams to pieces!
You're an inhuman monster!
I said, "Good day"!
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.
I'll get even, if it's the last thing I do.
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper, he'll get one.
"So shines a good deed...
"... in a weary world. "
My boy.
You've won!
You did it! You did it!
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!
Forgive me for putting you through this.
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.
And you passed the test.
You won!
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?
The chocolate, yes.
But, that's just the beginning!
We have so much time and so little to do!
Strike that. Reverse it.
This way, please!
We'll take the Wonkavator.
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.
A Wonkavator.
An elevator goes up and down.
But the Wonkavator goes sideways, slantways, backways...
And frontways?
...and any ways you can think of.
It can take you to any room by pressing one of these buttons. Any button.
Press a button and zing!
You're off.
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.
Except one.
This one.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Me?
There it goes!
Hold on tight!
I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen.
Faster! If we don't pick up speed, we won't get through.
Through what?
- You mean, we're going..?
- Up and out.
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1,000 pieces!
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.
Hold on, everybody!
Here it comes!
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.
Our town looks so pretty.
Look over here, Charlie.
I think I see our house.
It really looks beautiful.
There's my school!
How did you like the chocolate factory?
It's the most wonderful place in the world.
I'm pleased to hear you say that...
...because I'm giving it to you.
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?
- You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.
And I don't really want to try.
Who can I trust to run the factory, and take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?
Not a grown-up.
A grown-up would do everything his way, not mine.
That's why I decided long ago that I had to find a child.
A very honest...
...loving child...
...to whom I can tell all my precious candy-making secrets.
- That's why you sent the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.
- And me?
- Absolutely.
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.
I want you to bring them all.
But Charlie...
...don't forget what happened to the man who got everything he wanted.
What happened?
He lived happily ever after.
- I'm Statler.
- I'm Waldorf.
We're here to heckle
The Muppet Movie.
Gentlemen, that's straight ahead.
Private screening room D.
- Private screening?
- Yeah, they're afraid to show it in public.
STATLER: Oh, oh. Look at this place.
What a dump.
WALDORF: Bunch of weirdos around here. Look at 'em.
- Yes, I know you all want to sit with moi.
- Hey, lady. Is this seat taken?
Hey, you! Hey! Bring that back.
I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny,
I won't be able to live with myself.
Well, then you'll have to get another apartment, won't you?
You know,
I hear this movie is dynamite.
Get your fresh organic popcorn.
Only a buck.
Honey. Buy me some, please.
Sure, Momma.
Nothin's too good for my woman.
Woman! Woman! Woman!
- Well, I like the movie fine so far.
- It hasn't started yet.
- That's what I like about it.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
Yie, yie, yie, yie, yie!
Do it. Yay! (LAUGHING)
Oh, hey, Mr. The Frog.
Is it okay for me and my boomerang fish to be in your movie?
Hey!
I told you, Lew.
Not in the movie or at the screening.
Hey, but watch. Whoa!
(CLEARS THROAT) Kermit, does this film have socially redeeming value?
Oh, I... I certainly hope so, Sam.
Sorry about that.
- Kermie.
- Oh, hi, Piggy.
Kermie, I tried to save you a seat, but somebody took it.
Hi, everybody, and welcome to the first screening of The Muppet Movie.
But before we begin, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this film, starting with the little people, from the hairdressers to special effects.
That's enough of that, Harry.
- (ALL CLAMORING)
- Boom! Blow it up. Ka-boom!
- MUPPET: Boring.
- To the costume designers.
- To the prop makers.
- MISS PIGGY: Kermie, Kermie.
Speeches are not necessary, dear.
Roll film.
Yeah, but I'd like to thank everybody for all of their hard work and their patience
- and their...
- Roll film! Roll film!
Roll film.
Excuse me.
Uncle Kermit, is this about how the Muppets really got started?
Well, it's sort of approximately how it happened.
KERMIT: (SINGING) Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told
And some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing?
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep?
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
MAN: Help! Hello.
This is a serious call for help.
- Yeah?
- Someone help.
Ah, I... Oh, oh.
You, you with the banjo.
Can you help me?
I have lost my sense of direction.
Have you tried Hare Krishna?
Ha, ha. No.
- No. I mean I'm really lost.
- (FLY BUZZING)
One second.
Darn, I missed. You know, that's the first thing to go on a frog.
His tongue. The tongue goes and you can't catch flies.
That's rough.
I'm sorry about your tongue, but I have to get out of this swamp.
I have to catch a plane.
With that tongue? No way.
But seriously, there's a boat dock just downstream.
- Thank you.
- Just watch out for the alligators.
I will.
- Alligators?
- That's right.
Did you say alligators?
Read my lips, alligators.
It's just that I'm not used to alligators where I come from.
See, I'm an agent.
I... I winged in from Hollywood.
- Hollywood?
- That's right.
Did you say Hollywood?
Read my lips, Hollywood. You know...
Hollywood
The dream factory, the magic store.
Hey, don't you ever go to the movies?
Oh, sure. There's a double feature in town every Saturday.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
There's an ad in here that you should be very interested in.
- Feast your eyes on that.
- Uh...
"World Wide Studios announces open auditions for frogs
"wishing to become rich and famous."
Well, thanks anyway, but I'm really pretty happy where I am.
Oh, oh, if I were you,
I would give this audition very careful consideration.
You've got talent, kid.
Singin', tellin' jokes.
I mean, if you get your tongue fixed, who knows?
You could make millions of people happy.
- Millions of people happy?
- Millions.
Hey, if you ever come west to Hollywood, look me up.
Bernie the Agent.
Hey, well, listen, Bernie, why don't you say hello to Arnie the Alligator?
- What?
- Arnie.
Arnie, wait a minute. Careful, Arnie.
Stay! Stay!
Arnie, that's okay. Leave him alone.
It's all right, he's from Hollywood.
Hollywood. Gee.
I...
I'd miss this old swamp, but...
Millions of people happy.
What the...
MAN: Okay, okay, you guys.
Now, come on. Do what I tell you.
I don't know where you're...
All right, now...
Don't step on that asphalt!
I told you not to step on it.
We gotta get this... Off the asphalt!
I told you, stay off the asphalt!
Hey, look at him.
Oh, big legs.
MAN: Hey, you on the bike!
Watch out! Watch out!
- Watch out!
- Oh, my... Ah!
Watch out!
Oh!
Hmm.
That's pretty dangerous, building a road in the middle of the street.
I mean, if frogs couldn't hop,
I'd be gone with the Schwinn.
KERMIT: The El Sleezo Cafe.
Hmm.
Foreign food.
Doesn't smell promising, but a frog's gotta eat.
KERMIT: Wow.
Rough place, huh?
That's the toughest, meanest, filthiest, pesthole on the face of the Earth.
Well, why not complain to the owner?
I am the owner.
MAN: Watch out.
Hot plates comin' through. Look out.
All right, you got your French-fried frog legs on Cotton.
You got your frog legs on Eugenie.
You got your frog legs stroganoff.
- Everybody happy? All right.
- Ugh!
Hello, sailor. Buy me a drink?
Well, you see,
I'm not a sailor, I'm a frog.
Cut the small talk and buy me a drink.
- But I don't even know you.
- Hey. You makin' a move on my girl?
- No, sir.
- He did, too. He touched me.
Ugh! Go wash. You'll get warts.
- No, you see, that's just a myth.
- Yeah, but she's my "myth."
- No, no. Myth, myth.
- Yeth?
What the hey?
Showtime. Showtime at the El Sleezo.
PIANIST: And now, filling in for the vacationing El Sleezo dancing girls, the funny, furry, fabulous Fozzie Bear.
Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka.
Hey, you're a great crowd.
Thank you, thank you and thank you.
- Hey, wacka, wacka.
- (HONKING)
Ah, wacka, wacka, wacka.
Here I am, Fozzie Bear, to tell you jokes both old and rare.
Wacka, wacka, wacka.
Ha, ha. Let's start things off with a bang.
Thank you, sir.
Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka.
This guy's lost.
Maybe he should try Hare Krishna.
Grief, it's a running gag.
Uh...
There was this sailor who was so fat...
How fat was he?
Uh...
He was so fat that everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all.
FOZZIE: No problem.
Oh, wait, please.
Oh, please. Please wait.
I'm trying so hard. Please don't do that.
I'm a professional.
I've had three performances.
- Cut, cut, please.
- Do you know any dance routines?
What? Not really. Do you?
- Play something snappy.
- You got it.
- Now dance.
- What?
- Dance.
- Yes, sir.
Ah! Wacka, wacka.
Aha, wacka, wacka.
Ah!
It's too bad the dancing girls are on vacation. The crowd is getting ugly.
Ha, ha. You think this crowd's ugly, you should see the dancing girls.
FOZZIE: Two, three, four.
- Two, three, kick.
- Kick. Yeah, sorry.
Coming home.
FOZZIE: Argh!
Please. I just cleaned the fur.
Please. Oh.
I hope you appreciate that I'm doing all my own stunts.
Wacka wacka.
Okay, everybody. Drinks on the house.
Drinks on the house!
Man, come on, let's go.
- Drinks on the house.
- Go, go. On the house.
MAN: Drinks on the house.
I don't see no drinks up here.
What's he talkin' about?
The bartender said there were drinks on the house.
Works every time.
Well... Well, hey, listen.
My name is Kermit the Frog and I'm on my way to Hollywood.
- Hollywood?
- You wanna join me?
Big-time show biz.
That's always been my dream.
Yeah, well, they're holding auditions for frogs next week.
And if they need frogs, they must need bears, too.
Oh.
My car's right outside.
Gee, a Studebaker.
Where did you get it?
- My uncle left it to me.
- Huh? Is he dead?
No, he's hibernating.
You know, Fozzie, you really do have a lot of talent.
Thank you.
You know, how about you and me putting together an act?
Oh, no. Sorry. I only work as a single.
Oh, okay.
All right. You talked me into it.
We'll be a team.
Oh, good.
- What's this?
- Hey, you better pull over here.
Yes, sir.
- (BANGING)
- FOZZIE: Ah.
Hey, what's going on?
Howdy, Mr. Frog.
- I'm a businessman with a proposition.
- What?
Let me show you somethin' that might change your whole life.
Huh.
Hop right on over here, my little green friend.
- Listen, mister.
- That's it.
This is the kind of chance you can't afford to pass up.
- (GASPS)
- No, now, don't be afraid.
- Watch the window.
- Hm.
- KERMIT: What's that?
- FOZZIE: Ah.
- (KERMIT GASPS)
- Hi, I'm Doc Hopper, invitin' you to hop on down and get some Hopper's French-fried frog legs.
Right here at the sign of the bright green legs.
- Good grief.
- Come on.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Frog legs, frog legs, frog legs are fine
Hopper's is the place you should dine
There's cheese legs
Bacon legs, chili legs too
French-fried frog legs barbecued
Oh, Fozzie. Ugh.
If you want just a snack
Don't worry.
Then here is the one
A frog leg burger on a bright green bun
That is terrible.
That's the most appalling, disgusting, revolting thing I've ever seen.
I know. I'm a great businessman and a sweet fella, but I do lack the skills of a performer.
You also make a lousy frog.
You, on the other hand, make a terrific frog.
- What?
- He's right, you know.
- You are very likable, Kermit.
- The bear's right.
You, my little likable friend, are gonna do all our television commercials.
- No way.
- Hold it. Now, just a minute.
There's $500 in it for you up-front.
$500 is just the beginning.
You could be earning this much every year.
- Let's go, Fozzie.
Would you consider a bear in a frog suit?
- Fozzie.
- Yes, sir. I just lost my head. I...
Now, just a minute, Mr. Frog.
Everything's negotiable.
- FOZZIE: Okay, here we go, here we go.
- (BANGING)
- FOZZIE: Sorry.
- Hey, that's my Caddy!
- Just get it in gear, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
HOPPER:
Frog, it's money we're talking about.
Max!
- Follow that frog.
- (TIRES SQUEAL)
- Max!
- (BRAKES SCREECH)
Follow that frog with me in the car!
I'm sorry, Doc. I just got excited.
Hey, do you like the frog?
Isn't he terrific, Doc?
Terrific, Max, terrific. Now go!
But you promised me a reward.
Later, Max. Now follow that frog.
- FOZZIE: Oh, it's a gorgeous day.
- KERMIT: Yep, certainly is.
- Yep, terrific day for a drive.
- It's beautiful country out here.
A frog and a bear seeing America.
(SINGING) Movin' right along in search of good times and good news
With good friends, you can't lose
This could become a habit
Opportunity knocks once
Let's reach out and grab it
- Yeah!
- Together we'll nab it
We'll hitchhike, bus, or Yellow Cab it
Cab it?
BOTH: Movin' right along
Footloose and fancy-free
Getting there is half the fun
Come share it with me
Movin' right along
KERMIT: We'll learn to share the load
FOZZIE: We don't need a map to keep this show on the road
Hey, Fozzie, I want you to turn left if you come to a fork in the road.
Yes, sir. Turn left at the fork in the road.
FOZZIE: Kermit.
KERMIT: I don't believe that.
KERMIT: (SINGING) Movin' right along
We've found a life on the highway
FOZZIE: And your way is my way
KERMIT: So trust my navigation
FOZZIE: California, here we come
Come pie in the sky land
KERMIT: Palm trees and warm sand
Though sadly we just left Rhode Island
- We did what?
- Just forget it.
BOTH: Movin' right along
Hey, LA, where have you gone?
FOZZIE: Send someone to fetch us
We're in Saskatchewan
BOTH: Movin' right along
You take it, you know best
FOZZIE: Hey, I've never seen the sun come up in the west
Ah.
A bear in his natural habitat.
A Studebaker.
- Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead.
- What is that?
Maybe we should give him a ride.
I don't know. He's pretty big.
- Hey, there. Want a lift?
- Oh, no, thanks.
I'm on my way to New York City to try to break into public television.
Ah.
Good luck.
BOTH: (SINGING) Movin' right along
We're truly birds of a feather
We're in this together
And we know where we're goin'
Movie stars with flashy cars and life with the top down
We're stormin' the big town
Yeah, storm is right.
Should it be snowing?
No, I don't think so.
BOTH: Movin' right along
Footloose and fancy-free
You're ready for the big time
Is it ready for me?
Movin' right along
KERMIT: Hey.
Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead there.
There's one of those
Doc Hopper billboards.
- Maybe you'd better pull over.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, look at that.
Kermit, that's you.
You got the picture, boy?
You see what I mean?
Kermit the Frog, symbol of
Doc Hopper's French-fried frog legs.
Isn't that splendid? Just splendid.
Just take a look at it.
All I can see are millions of frogs on tiny crutches.
Now, listen, boy.
Don't you wanna be rich and famous?
- Not workin' for you, I don't.
- That's right.
- Crutches?
- Shut up, Max.
We're a small-time operation, but we're expandin'.
Expandin', just like you frogs expand.
Don't you frogs expand?
- That's a myth.
- What?
Myth! Myth!
Yeth?
BOTH: Huh?
- Come on, Bear. Burn rubber.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Frog!
That's the second time!
Max, I've done my best with that frog.
Now's the time to do my worst.
- Open the door.
- No! You open the door.
- What?
- I'm through, Doc. The frog is right.
You're asking him to do something terrible. I can't be a part of it.
It's a moral decision and I'll stand by it.
- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.
FOZZIE: Kermit, where are we?
Well, let's see.
We were just traveling down this little black line here.
And we just crossed that little red line over here.
Well, how about...
Let's take the blue line, huh?
- No, we can't take that. That's a river.
- Oh, I knew that.
- Yeah, sure.
- Listen, Kermit, why don't we just go...
- Fozzie. Fozzie.
- Huh. Yeah?
Who's driving?
- KERMIT: Look out! Stop!
- FOZZIE: No problem.
- Okay, back it up.
- Ah, yes, sir.
- Fozzie, where did you learn to drive?
- I took a correspondence course.
This looks like a nice quiet spot.
Uh-huh.
Boy, it feels like we've been driving for days.
Yeah. Funny, I'm still wide awake.
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.
- (BAND PLAYING)
- What? What? What? I'm up, I'm up.
What's that?
They don't look like Presbyterians to me.
Hey, cool it, everybody.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Our gentle mornin' melodies have attracted wanderin' admirers.
- Hey, who are you guys?
- We am, is, are and be they whom as are known as the Electric Mayhem.
- (LAUGHING)
- For sure.
He's Dr. Teeth.
Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.
- Thank you.
- Fozzie.
- I'm Floyd, I blow bass.
- And I'm...
I'm...
Zoot. Sax is your ax.
Uh-oh. Zoot's skipped a groove again.
Wow, like, I'm Janice.
I'm lead guitar, for surely.
Oh, yeah. That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do, Animal.
I want to eat drums.
No, no. Beat drums, beat drums.
Beat drums. Beat drums.
- Down, Animal. Back. Sit.
- Down. Back. Sit.
MUPPET: Hey, don't forget about me.
I'm Scooter, the band's road manager.
Oh, yeah. The road manager.
We couldn't go anywhere without him.
- He's the man with the contacts?
- No, he's the man with the van.
Yeah, we're takin' this old church and turnin' it into a coffeehouse.
Yeah, with real good music and organic refreshments.
It'll be so fine and laid-back and mellow and profitable.
ANIMAL: Profitable.
Yeah, but what brings you dudes here?
Listen, see, Kermit here, he was living in the swamp...
- Fozzie.
...and then a fisherman came along.
Fozzie, you can't tell 'em the whole story.
You'll bore the audience.
Oh, sorry.
But, Kermit, the band here wants to know.
Well, let 'em read the screenplay.
Ah! Yes, sir.
Uh...
You see, it starts here on page one.
The Muppet Movie, huh?
Hmm. Let's see.
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.
In a long helicopter shot,
"we discover Kermit the Frog playin' his banjo and singin'.
"A Hollywood agent starts the frog travelin' west.
"Doc Hopper comes on strong and they get to this church.
"Interior. Church. Day.
"Fozzie. 'They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.'
"Kermit and Fozzie come walkin' down the aisle
"to the thunderously loud music of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem."
- Which am us.
- For sure, for sure.
This is a narrative of very heavy-duty proportions.
Yeah. Cosmic, man.
We gotta keep his little froggy self away from this Hopper dude.
Too true, too true.
It is indeed a problem for us to probosculate upon.
But it seems to me that the frog and the bear are temporarily out of service.
Oh, wow, like, what can we do to help them?
- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.
...we'd think of a clever plot device.
Like disguising their car so they won't be recognized.
Right. Two, three, four.
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!
All right.
Everybody's lover, everybody's brother
I wanna be your lifetime friend
Crazy as a rocket, nothin' in my pocket
I'll keep it at the rainbow's end
I never think of money
I think of milk and honey
Grinnin' like a Cheshire cat
I focus on the pleasure
Somethin' I can treasure
Can you picture that?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Floyd. Take a verse.
(SINGING) Let me take your picture
Add it to the mixture
There it is, I got you now
Really nothin' to it, anyone can do it
It's easy and we all know how
Now begins the changin'
Mental rearrangin'
Nothin's really where it's at
Now the Eiffel Tower's holdin' up a flower
I gave it to a Texas cat
Fact is there's nothin' out there you can't do
Yeah, even Santa Claus believes in you
Beat down the walls
Begin, believe, begat
Be a better drummer
Be an up-and-comer
Can you picture that?
Only what you got
All of us are winnin'
Pickin' and a-grinnin'
Lordy, but I love to jam
Jelly-belly gigglin'
Dancin' and a-wigglin'
Honey, that's the way I am
I lost my heart in Texas
Northern lights affects us
I keep it underneath my hat
Aurora Borealis
Shinin' down on Dallas
Can you picture that?
Can you picture?
You gotta see it in your mind
Can you picture?
You know it's quick and easy to find
Can you picture?
You don't have to buy a frame
Can you picture?
Can you picture that?
- Use it if you need it
- Don't forget to feed it
Can you picture that?
FLOYD: Great job.
Doc Hopper will never recognize you now.
- I don't know how to thank you guys.
- I don't know why to thank you guys.
Our pleasure, green stuff.
Are you sure you won't come with us to Hollywood?
Can't, baby, but when you get rich and famous, maybe we'll show up and exploit your wealth.
Movin' right along, Fozzie.
ANIMAL: Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
(CHANTING) Hollywood! Hollywood!
Hollywood!
Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood!
HOPPER: Remember, this frog does everything.
He talks, he sings, he dances.
He tells jokes. He even rides a bicycle.
Max, find me a frog and a bear in a tan Studebaker.
Gee, Doc. All I can see is a frog and a bear in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.
What?
- Fozzie, they're right behind us.
- I know, I know.
- Well, how did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.
- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.
I'm gaining on 'em, Doc.
I'm gaining on 'em.
- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.
There's a sign up ahead there.
Pull in front of that.
- Move. Now duck.
- What?
- Get down, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.
Aha!
- GONZO: Oh, yeah?
- (CLUCKING)
GONZO: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Oh, I tell you, Camilla, great plumbers are born, not made.
I'm a prince of plunger, fair maiden.
GONZO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll do that. But first, wait till we get there.
Fozzie, look at that funny little truck.
Yeah, it's cute, huh?
- No, it's coming straight at us.
- (CLUCKS)
KERMIT: We're gonna hit.
We missed it.
Oh, you call that a miss?
GONZO: Well, I'm getting in your car.
FOZZIE: Oh, boy.
You guys okay?
Why are you hopping up and down?
Because I'm hopping mad.
Guy's got a sense of humor.
- Hey, why don't you join us?
- Where are you going?
- We're following our dream.
- Really? I have a dream, too.
- KERMIT AND FOZZIE: Huh?
- But you'll think it's stupid.
- KERMIT: No, I won't.
- FOZZIE: Tell us, tell us.
Well, I wanna go to Bombay, India and become a movie star.
CAMILLA: Ah.
You don't go to Bombay to become a movie star.
You go where we're going, Hollywood.
Sure, if you wanna do it the easy way.
We picked up a weirdo.
KERMIT: Hey, look up ahead.
There's Mad Man Mooney's.
- FOZZIE: What's that?
- KERMIT: It's a used-car lot.
I think we can trade in both these old cars and get one big one.
FOZZIE: Wait.
Trade in my uncle's Studebaker?
KERMIT: Sure.
FOZZIE: Oh, when he wakes up, he'll kill me.
KERMIT: You're swinging this turn very wide, Fozzie.
FOZZIE: Well, hold it, will you?
Just... Here we go. Up the bump.
KERMIT: There we go. Hold on. All right.
Pull up ahead there.
- FOZZIE: Look at these cars.
- GONZO: Kermit, Kermit, Kermit.
- Are you gonna sell my plunger, too?
- There's all kinds of great cars.
FOZZIE: No, he's not gonna sell your plunger.
KERMIT: Look at 'em up there.
Pull it up a little further here, Fozzie.
FOZZIE: Where should I stop?
- How should I stop?
- KERMIT: A little bit farther.
- GONZO: Easy, easy.
- FOZZIE: Okay. Here?
- KERMIT: Everybody out of the car.
- FOZZIE: Okay. Chickens first.
Oh, my dear friends. Welcome to Mad Man Mooney's hubcap heaven.
Today... Today is your lucky day.
- It is?
- Yes, it is. You, for example...
- You're driving the wrong car.
- I am?
I can put you in this German street machine for only $2,000, less a $12 trade-in on your old vehicle.
Now, this...
This car is one of the greatest...
Detachable fenders for narrow garages.
No, thanks.
Hey, what is this pile of...
Jack, get rid of this heap.
Come out here!
- What? What?
- What's the matter with you?
- That's my jack.
- Oh, hi, Jack.
Jack not name. Jack job.
How many times have I told you not to talk to the customers?
- Gee, I know, but...
- Just move this.
Move it. You understand?
FOZZIE: Wow. Ah!
But seriously, friends,
Mad Man Mooney doesn't believe in all that dealing and wheeling.
No, the price on the sticker is the price you pay.
- And never more and never less.
- (FLY BUZZING)
Ha.
We'll take that one for $11.95.
What?
Less our $12 trade-in.
You owe us a nickel.
Oh, thank you very much.
Hey, we're all going to Hollywood.
- Do you wanna come with us?
- Hollywood?
That's strange, he just ran away.
Well, movin' right along, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.
- (CLUCKING)
KERMIT: Hey, watch where you're going now, Fozzie.
FOZZIE: Yes, sir.
Hey!
Hey, where are you goin'?
Hey! Wait for me.
I wanna go to Hollywood.
Hey, wait for me!
Come on, guys. Wait! Please!
I wanna go to Hollywood.
Testing, one, two, three. Testing.
Can you hear me?
Well, it's time to announce the winner of this year's
Bogen County beauty pageant.
MAN: We sure grow 'em purdy around here, don't we?
All right. Here they are.
- MAN: The first runner-up...
- What's over there, Kermit?
- MAN: Is Debbie-Sue Anderson.
- Over there. See?
Ah! Nice-looking girls, huh?
- Wow. Nice-looking chickens.
- What?
- Oh, no hard feelings, honey.
- MAN: Before announcing the winner,
I think we should thank the judges of today's contest,
Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.
You're not gonna believe who the winner is, folks.
- Come, now, Charlie. It's their movie.
- So it is. So it is.
And here she is, folks.
This year's Miss Bogen County...
Miss Piggy!
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Thank you.
Wow, it's a pig. Did you see that?
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
Oh. Oh, Debbie-Sue.
Oh, Elma-Jane.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ohh.
Thank you. Oh, oh, thank you.
Oh, kissy-kissy. Kissy-kissy.
Oh, thank you. Oh.
- Kermit, you know...
- Not... Not right now, Fozzie.
I just want to say one thing.
This is the happiest moment of my...
(SINGING) Never before
Have two souls joined so freely
And so fast
For me this is the first time
And the last
Is this an angel's wish
For men?
Never before
And never again
And where to find the words
To sing its worth
This love was bound for heaven
Not for Earth
This love was meant
To light the stars
But when we touched
We made it ours
And could they take it back?
Oh, no, they wouldn't dare
Why should they take it back
When there's enough
To share with all the world
And fill the heavens above
With leftover love?
Never before
A love that keeps on growing
On and on
To fill each lover's heart
And light the dawn
Is this an angel's wish
For men?
Never before
And never again
Never before
And never again
- Oh, oh.
- Thanks. Excuse me.
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Yeah.
Listen, congratulations on winning the beauty contest.
Thank you. Of course, normally,
I don't do anything so trivial.
- I am an actress-model.
- Oh, is that right?
Well... I...
I'm gonna be a performer, too.
Oh.
Hey, Kermit.
Who's the cute-lookin' pig?
I beg your pardon.
If you were a chicken, you'd be impeccable.
Gonzo.
Hey, I thought we were gonna go get some ice cream.
Oh, well, in a minute. I'll join you.
Um...
Well...
What are you doing in town, short, green and handsome?
Well... We're headed west.
- Really?
- Yeah, but...
You know, I really should join my friends for ice cream.
Oh.
You... You wanna come along?
Me? You mean it? Oh.
I'll be right back. Oh, oh.
Don't move.
Hmm.
Hello. I'd like an ice cream.
What do you want? Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, peach fudge, rum, banana?
- Honey.
- Honey?
I beg your pardon. I hardly know you.
Ah.
But seriously,
I'd like a honey ice cream cone for me.
And a dragonfly ripple for my friend, the frog.
Okay. One honey cone for the bear.
- And one dragonfly ripple for the frog.
- Ugh!
- Don't get 'em mixed up.
- Gotcha.
All right, all right, Camilla.
I'll get you a balloon, but you have to pick the color.
Red or green?
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- GONZO: What?
Why not take both?
What a wild idea.
Yeah. A beautiful chicken like that deserves two balloons.
- You're right.
- I have guys come in all the time.
Sometimes they get a bunch of balloons for their girls.
- They go gaga for it.
- Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch.
Gaga. Gaga. Aw.
Gonzo?
Wonder...
Where they went? Fozzie?
FOZZIE: Kermit. Kermit.
Hey, Kermit. Hey.
Where's your pig friend?
Well, I'm not really sure. She said she was coming for ice cream, but...
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.
Here I am. Here I am.
- I'm packed. I'm packed.
- Yeah, so I see.
What for?
You said I could come with you.
Yeah, but...
To buy ice cream, not to Hollywood.
- We're going to Hollywood?
- No. I mean, listen...
When I... When I said...
I mean, well, when you heard...
Oh, brother.
GONZO: Oh! Oh!
What? Gonzo?
- KERMIT: Gonzo! What are you doing?
- MISS PIGGY: What?
About seven knots.
- We'll follow you. To the car.
- Yes, sir.
KERMIT: Gonzo, we're coming!
- KERMIT: Step on it, Fozzie!
- FOZZIE: Yes, sir.
MISS PIGGY: Oh, Kermit.
You're a born leader.
KERMIT: Now, where is he?
(SIGHS) Isn't this great?
Here I am floating in space.
This is the place to be.
Whoopee!
- Fozzie.
- Yes.
- Bear left.
- What?
- Bear left.
- Right, Frog.
- What? That's cute.
- Never mind.
This is...
Look at our little car down there.
Oh, this is like flying.
Hey, this is flying.
I'm flying! Whoopee!
Doc, isn't that a frog up there?
No, that's a frog down here.
KERMIT: He's caught in a crosswind,
Fozzie.
We're gonna lose him.
FOZZIE: Oh, no.
- Oh, what are you doin', Doc?
- I'm goin' after the tires.
KERMIT: We're okay now.
The wind's shifted.
- Wait a minute. Stay with him, Fozzie.
- FOZZIE: Yeah.
- He's right above us.
- GONZO: Whoo-hoo!
- He's okay.
- Yeah. Hi, Gonzo.
- Fozzie, come back in here.
- What?
- Come back in here.
- Yes, sir.
Oh!
KERMIT: Why don't you stay on the road?
Kermit!
KERMIT: Look out for the billboard.
MAX: No!
- Take off, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.
Come back, you!
No frog's gonna make a monkey out of me!
I'm back.
I don't understand any of this.
I just gotta catch up with those guys.
MISS PIGGY: Kermit, you were so courageous.
So magnificent.
- Gee, I don't know what to say.
- Say the bear was magnificent.
After all, I did the driving.
And I took a 100-foot belly flop onto a moving car.
Yes, but Kermit assumed the awesome responsibility of command.
- Gee.
- Oh, brother.
Um...
Why don't we stop somewhere for the night and have a quiet little dinner...
For two?
Terrific! I'll eat with you, Miss Piggy.
Not you, buzzard beak.
Just mon capitaine and moi.
Well... That... That might be nice.
Oh. Wow.
Good evening, Miss Piggy.
You look lovely tonight.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry if I kept you waiting.
Oh, it... It was worth it.
How charming of vous.
I... I took the liberty of ordering us some wine.
Mmm.
Oh, waiter.
Yes?
May I help you?
The... The wine, please.
Mmm.
You mad, impetuous thing.
It's champagne.
Not exactly. Sparkling muscatel.
One of the finest wines of Idaho.
Well, you may serve us now, please.
Oh, may I?
- Look how he does that.
- Yep.
- Very suave.
- Mmm.
Don't you want to smell the bottle cap?
Oh.
- Mmm-hmm. Smells good.
- Mmm. Yes.
- Would you like to taste it first?
- Well...
I think he's supposed to.
Would you taste it for us, please?
Ugh!
- Excellent choice.
- Should be for 95 cents.
Hmm.
- And may we have straws, please?
- Yes.
I expected that.
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Here's to you, Miss Piggy.
- Oh.
Drink up.
Oh.
Makes me giggly.
The wine?
Everything.
It's a beautiful evening, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
The moon is just lovely.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, Miss Piggy, the moon doesn't look like you.
- WAITER: Miss Piggy.
- Hmm.
Miss Piggy.
- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes.
- Telephone.
- Oh.
Uh... Oh...
Kermie, I did place one phone call to my agent.
It'll only be an eensy-teensy moment.
What the hey?
Evenin'. Rowlf, Rowlf the Dog.
Sit yourself down.
- Kermit, Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet you.
I'm no Heifetz, but I get by.
That was... That was very nice.
- (SNIFFS)
- Oh.
A broken heart, right?
- Does it show?
- Listen.
When you've been ticklin' the ivories as long as I have, you've seen a broken heart for every drop of rain, a shattered dream for every fallen star.
Exactly. She just walked out on me.
Yeah? Typical. That's why I live alone.
- You do, huh?
- You bet.
I finish work, I go home, read a book, have a couple of beers, take myself for a walk and go to bed.
Nice and simple.
Stay away from women, that's my motto.
- But I can't.
- Neither can I. That's my trouble.
(SINGING) You can't live with 'em
You can't live without 'em
There's somethin' irresistible-ish about 'em
We grin and bear it
'cause the nights are long
I hope that somethin' better comes along
I see what you mean.
It's no good complainin'
And pointless to holler
If she's a beauty
She'll get under your collar
She made a monkey out of old King Kong
I hope that somethin' better comes along
Still, it's fun when they're fetchin'
And agree to see an etching that you keep at your lily pad
There is no solution
It's part of evolution
The pitter-patter of souls
The little feet of tadpoles
Rowlf, tadpoles don't have feet.
Oh, sorry about that. Two, three, four.
There's no limitation to mixin' and matchin'
Some get an itchin' for a critter they've been scratchin'
A skunk was badgered
The results were strong
I hope that somethin' better
I hope that somethin' better comes along
WAITER: Phone call for Kermit the Frog.
- Are you Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.
Phone.
Huh.
It's not often you see a guy that green have the blues that bad.
- Hello.
- Kermie, please...
- Piggy, is that you?
- HOPPER: Yes, that's her.
And this is Doc Hopper.
You listen, Frog. And listen good.
Step outside the motel right now.
My guys will meet you there.
Well... What if I don't?
Then your girlfriend will be ham-hocked by breakfast.
Kermie. Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Uh, uh...
Are you the guys I'm supposed to meet?
That's good, Glen. That's good.
That's nice and tight.
- The Professor's here, Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.
Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.
I know you're planning something bold and clever.
Well, I got us this far, didn't I?
- How are you?
- Ah, Professor Krassman.
It's good to see you, Doc, you little rustic devil, you.
Where's my victim?
I mean, patient?
Step this way, Professor.
Let me introduce you to your patient.
Professor Krassman is the world's leadin' authority on mind control in frogs.
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic, don't you?
Tell us what you're gonna do to our little Kermit.
Well, we're going to perform an electronic cerebrectomy.
- Hmm?
- A what?
- (GASPS)
- Electronic cerebrectomy.
What's that?
It's something so sensational that you'll have to hold on to your hat.
Yes?
When a German scientist says,
"Hold on to your hat," it's not casual conversation.
Hold on to your hat! Hat! Hold! Good.
Now, what we're going to do is bring out a machine that's going to wow you.
Bertram! Bertram, you...
Bring out the machine!
Wait till you see this.
You think we're sleeping in Düsseldorf?
You think we're taking a nap in Cologne?
No, we're working at night.
Each night a new dial, a new knob...
Electronic...
Cerebrectomy, cerebrectomy.
Electronic cerebrectomy.
- What does it do?
- What does it do? What does it do?
It turns the brains into guacamole.
First of all, I'll pull out of this, okay?
Wonderful.
Second?
Halt! Argh!
I detest the surfeit of provincial laughter.
Now, we take your friend, the little F-O-R-G, put him in the chair, clamp on the terminals, drop the electronic yarmulke, and throw, what we call in German, the switch.
Yes, you little green devil. Soon it'll be a hot time for the old skull tonight.
Thank you, Herr Machine.
Now, the frog will do your bidding.
He will do your every whim, your every wish.
He will do your television commercial, yes.
He will sell your frogs' legs.
- Zaparoonie.
- Head full of jelly.
- A noggin full of library paste.
- Let's fry them brains!
Professor Krassman, you've got a fun job.
I love it, I love it.
If I can inflict a little pain during the afternoon, I sleep good at night.
- Well, we'll let you get on with it, then.
- My pleasure.
Max.
I'll be back later to pick up what's left of the frog.
What's left of the frog?
You can have everything, excuse the brain.
All right. Bring over the frog.
Oh, Kermie.
Whatever happens next,
I wouldn't give up this evening together for anything.
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.
Oh, Kermie.
- Hey.
- Okay.
I got him. I got him.
Good, good, good, good, good.
And why don't we take a little seat, Kermit?
Hands down.
- Get the feet into place.
- (WHIMPERING)
Will you stop whimpering?
Go out like a frog, not a little toad.
Okay, Herr Machine.
This is big time here.
Ready to go to work? Hand clamps!
Foot clamps!
You can struggle all you want now, frog.
It'll do you very little good.
All right. And now it's time to drop the electronic beanie.
Soon, there'll be enough voltage coursing through your little frog brain to light up Cincinnati.
Oh, please, please. Not my frog. Please!
- Say goodbye to the frog, pig.
- Why should I?
Because in 10 seconds, he won't know you from kosher bacon.
That does it!
Hi-yah!
Hi! Hi!
Hi-yah!
Hii-yah!
Hii-yah! Hi! Hi!
Hii-yah!
Hi-yah!
What the heck's goin' on here?
A pig that goes bananas?
What is this? A luau?
- MAN: Where'd she go?
- MISS PIGGY: Oh, boys.
- There she is.
- Get her!
I must reach the switch. I must...
- Switch. I must reach...
- Oh, no.
Hi-yah!
- Now, Kermie.
- Oh, thank you.
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
Well...
Shall we go now, Kermie?
Well...
Just a second.
Hello.
- Piggy, it's your agent.
- Ooh.
Thank you.
Yeah, Morty, what have you got?
Commercial?
How much? Mmm-hmm.
When?
Take it.
(NORMAL VOICE) Um.
Goodbye.
- FOZZIE: What's going on?
- Hey, what happened?
Irritated!
Don't worry, Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.
Yeah, yeah. Just be cool and eat another seat cushion.
Seat cushion!
Well, how do you like the film?
I've seen detergents that leave a better film than this.
Well, I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.
Oh, good.
Der flim is okey-dokey.
- Good. Roll film.
- Flim is rolling.
- GONZO: Quiet.
- FOZZIE: Quiet.
FOZZIE: Quiet, Gonzo.
- This is the patriotic part.
- Should we stand up?
No.
FOZZIE: O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plains
America, America
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
Patriotism swells in the heart of the American bear.
Hold it, boys. Hold it!
Hold your fire!
Boys, no reflection on the job you've been doin', but I decided to bring in a specialist.
Now, boys, this is Snake Walker.
Tell 'em what you do, Snake.
Kill frogs.
FOZZIE: How long is it to Hollywood?
KERMIT:
We gotta be there by tomorrow.
GONZO: Hey, Kermit. Are you gonna get an agent like that pig had?
FOZZIE: Gonzo, you know he's touchy about that.
- ROWLF: Hey, who's that?
- KERMIT: I don't believe that.
- KERMIT: Piggy?
- FOZZIE: Kermit.
Kermit.
- That's Piggy.
- Yeah, I know.
ROWLF: Hey, do you think we should help her with her bag?
- ALL: No.
- Kermie.
Kermie, what an unbelievable coincidence.
FOZZIE: Hmm.
Hello again. It's me.
Would you hold my vanity case?
Hi-yah!
- Well.
- Well, what?
So much has happened to me since I saw you last.
- Yeah, sure.
- Frankly, Miss Piggy, I don't give a hoot.
My name is Rowlf the Dog and I was playing the piano... Oh, never mind.
- Kermie.
- Yeah?
- I missed you.
- Yeah.
Don't I get one kissy-kissy?
Uh, no, I... I don't think so, Miss Piggy.
Just one little hug.
FOZZIE: Hmmm.
- Oh, Piggy.
- Kermie.
HOPPER: (ON RADIO)
You've been listenin' to music to hug frogs by.
And this is Doc Hopper sayin' that if Kermit the Frog don't stop right now and call me, and agree to be my national spokesman, he will soon be a frog burger.
Kermie. Ah!
We'll be okay.
Mon capitaine.
- FOZZIE: Oh, boy. Yeah, what?
- KERMIT: Fozzie?
FOZZIE: No problem. It's okay, it's okay.
No problem. Okay, all right.
- Listen...
- KERMIT: Oh, boy.
FOZZIE: Oh, we're in trouble.
I wish I still had my Studebaker.
ROWLF: Probably somethin' broken about the engine, I think.
GONZO: Hey, don't worry.
Someone's bound to come along.
Well, I guess we blew it, huh, Gonzo?
Yeah.
But the sky sure is beautiful out here.
Look at that.
We...
We're gonna miss the auditions tomorrow, right?
Kermit?
GONZO: Boy, you could get lost in a sky like that.
I wish I had those balloons again.
So much for Hollywood.
Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it.
I never promised anything.
(SINGING) This looks familiar
Vaguely familiar
Almost unreal, yet
It's too soon to feel yet
Close to my soul
And yet so far away
I'm going to go back there someday
Sun rises, night falls
Sometimes the sky calls
Is that a song there?
And do I belong there?
I've never been there
But I know the way
I'm going to go back there someday
Come and go with me
It's more fun to share
We'll both be completely
At home in midair
We're flyin', not walking
On featherless wings
We can hold on to love
Like invisible strings
There's not a word yet
For old friends who've just met
Part heaven, part space
Or have I found my place?
You can just visit
But I plan to stay
I'm going to go back there
Someday
I'm going to go back there
Someday
I didn't promise anybody anything.
What do I know about Hollywood anyway?
Just the dreams I got from sitting through too many double features.
KERMIT'S VOICE: So, why did you leave the swamp in the first place?
'Cause some agent fella said I had talent.
He probably says that to everybody.
On the other hand, if you hadn't left the swamp, you'd be feeling pretty miserable anyhow.
Yeah, but then it would just be me feeling miserable.
Now I got a lady pig and a bear, and a chicken, a dog, a thing, whatever Gonzo is.
He's a little like a turkey.
Yeah. A little like a turkey, but not much.
No, I guess not.
Anyhow, I brought 'em all out here into the middle of nowhere.
It's all my fault.
Still, whether you promised them something or not, you gotta remember they wanted to come.
But that's because they believed in me.
No, they believed in the dream.
- Well, so do I, but...
- You do?
Yeah. Of course I do.
- Well, then?
- Well, then...
I guess I was wrong when I said I never promised anyone.
I promised me.
Hey. Now, wait a minute.
Hey, what... What's happening?
At the moment, we're what's happening.
Oh, great. Wonderful. Yeah.
Zoot, hey, Zoot.
Hold it, hold it.
Animal, cool it back there.
Yeah.
All right, yeah.
Hey, listen, it's wonderful to see you guys, but how did you ever find us?
Oh, easy.
We just read the screenplay you left us.
"Exterior. Desert. Night."
We knew right where you were.
Like, can you get behind it?
Hey, listen. When do you dudes have to be at that audition?
2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Well, climb aboard the bus. We'll have breakfast at Hollywood and Vine.
ALL: Movin' right along
FLOYD: Oh, yeah.
TEETH: Here we go.
Movin' right along
Kermie, whisper sweet nothings into my ear.
Motorcycle cop.
Motorcycle cop is a sweet nothing?
A motorcycle cop is chasing us.
- Hey, Dr. Teeth, you better pull over.
- Hey, easier done than said.
FLOYD: Uh-oh.
JANICE: Drag city.
What do we do now, huh?
Oh, dear.
TEETH: Hey, hey.
The man with the badge.
The police, the cops, the fuzz, the P.I...
- Don't you dare!
- I wouldn't think of it.
Did we do something wrong, Officer?
- Kermit, it's him.
- Okay, gang. Let him explain.
This whole disguise is only so I could warn you.
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
I never thought that Doc was gonna hurt Kermit.
I only thought he was gonna lean on him a little.
But now he's got this frog killer in from the coast, and the man is deadly.
FOZZIE: Oh, no, Kermit.
What are we gonna do?
- It's time to beat feet, green stuff.
- FOZZIE: Let's get out of here, Kermit.
I love it.
Chase music is one of our best riffs.
Hold it, Dr. Teeth. What's up ahead?
- It's only an old ghost town.
- Fine.
Listen, you go back and tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.
- What?
- What?
- Kermit, you'll get killed.
- Oh, please, no.
- FOZZIE: Kermit, you can't do that.
- Now, listen, guys.
Listen, I can't spend my whole life running away from a bully.
It's time for a showdown.
Showdown! Showdown!
Uh, hey, listen,
I'm gonna check things out.
- Everybody stay in the bus, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
Hey, Kermit.
Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
What is that?
That's one of my latest inventions.
A musical rotating rain barrel.
Oh, oh, yeah.
You see, I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and this is my assistant, Beaker.
We live here perfecting useful inventions.
- Come in, come in.
- (MEEPING)
BUNSEN:
Welcome to our laboratory.
Please don't touch anything.
Uh...
- Is this the only street into town?
- Yes, yes.
Hey, what are you dudes doin' in here?
I'm so glad you asked.
We're perfecting our latest invention.
Insta-Grow pills.
Yeah, well, what in the name of Fats Waller is that?
A 4-foot prune.
A 4-foot prune?
Yeah, man, well, what else do these pills make big?
Oh, they work on anything, but the effect is sadly temporary.
Sadly temporary. (SIGHS)
Oh, no!
SCOOTER: Hey, Kermit.
Here comes Doc Hopper.
I know. I'll be ready for him.
Okay, Frog. Where are you?
KERMIT: I'm here.
I'll meet you in the middle of the street.
Oh, yeah?
KERMIT: Man to frog.
- KERMIT: All right, Hopper.
- All right, Frog.
One last chance.
You gonna do my TV commercials live or stuffed?
Hopper, what's the matter with you?
You gotta be crazy, chasin' me halfway across the country.
Why are you doing this to me?
'Cause all my life, I wanted to own a thousand frog leg restaurants, and you're the key, greenie.
Yeah, well, I've got a dream, too.
But it's about singing and dancing and making people happy.
That's the kind of dream that gets better the more people you share it with.
And, well, I've found a whole bunch of friends who have the same dream.
And...
And it kind of makes us like a family.
Do you have anybody like that, Hopper?
I mean, once you get all those restaurants, who are you gonna share it with?
Who are your friends, Doc?
Those guys?
Max.
I got lots of friends.
Max, for instance.
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man, Doc.
And I think if you look in your heart, you'll find you really wanna let me and my friends go to follow our dreams.
But if that's not the kind of man you are, or what I'm saying doesn't make any sense to you, well, then, go ahead and kill me.
All right, boys.
Kill him.
No, wait, please.
Animal!
Ha! Ha, ha, ha!
Everybody, on to Hollywood.
ALL: Yay!
GONZ0: Wow! Wicked!
TEETH: Yeah, next stop is Hollywood and Vine.
FOZZIE: Look at the ocean. The ocean.
Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have those deal numbers for you in a jiffy.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Mmm-hmm.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.
He's packaging a blockbuster.
Mmm-hmm.
- Ah, Kermie, look, it's wonderful.
- Yeah.
Like a dream come true.
Well, don't count your tadpoles until they're hatched.
- I still have to audition, you know.
- Hey, there ain't nothin' to it, but to do it.
And where do you think you're going?
Oh, hi, there.
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.
You can't just walk in here off the street, you know.
Especially not with all these animals.
Animals? What's wrong with animals?
ANIMAL: Animal!
This is a movie studio, not a zoo!
Besides...
I'm allergic to animal hair.
Now, get along, all of you.
No. Wait a second. See here, miss.
I may not be one of your fancy Hollywood frogs, but I deserve a chance.
And we're gonna stay right here in this office until you let us in to see Lew Lord.
- Aren't we, gang, huh?
- Yes!
- FLOYD: What he says.
- GONZO: Yeah, come on.
KERMIT: We'll just sit right down and wait.
Hello, security, it's Miss Tracey.
I wanna report a... (SNEEZES)
GONZO: Shake. Shake.
Shake, everyone.
KERMIT: That's it.
GONZO: Good, good, good. Do it.
- FLOYD: Yeah, go get 'em, Animal.
- KERMIT: Way to go.
FOZZIE: Allergies are nothing to sneeze at.
TEETH: I'm allergic to cats myself.
KERMIT: That's it, Rowlf.
- We got it.
- (CAMILLA CLUCKS)
- KERMIT: Wow.
- (BUZZER SOUNDS)
FLOYD: Yeah, all right.
- Okay, way to go, guys.
- FOZZIE: All right.
Thanks, miss.
Well, friends, this is it.
Uh, Mr. Lord, forgive the interruption, but I'm here to audition.
MISS PIGGY: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
KERMIT: We've come over 2,000 miles...
Uh, oh, boy.
Kermie, we're all with you.
Please, sir. My name is Kermit the Frog, and we read your ad and...
Well, we've come to be rich and famous.
Miss Tracey.
Prepare the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract for Kermit the Frog and company.
Yes. We did it. We did it.
I can't believe it.
Oh, just look at all this.
How did a frog make the big time?
(SINGING) It starts when we're kids
A show-off at school
Makin' faces at friends
You're a clown and a fool
Doin' pratfalls and bird calls and bad imitations
Ignoring your homework
Now that's dedication
You work to the mirror
You're getting standing ovations
You're burning with hope
You're building up steam
What was once juvenile-ish
Is grown-up and stylish
You're close to your dream
And somebody out there loves you
Stands up and hollers for more
More!
You've found a home at the magic store
Right, everybody.
Production number, okay?
- Off the trucks and on the job.
- On the job!
Hey, whoa, halt, cease, stop.
Wow, let's do it.
- Do what?
- The movie.
FOZZIE: Yes, sir. A foot stomper.
- Makeup.
- Yes, let's do it. Yes.
Hey, Fozzie, take those wagons out of there.
Yes, sir. I'm off.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Scenery over there, right?
Movin' right along. Hey!
Hey, those are the trees for the swamp.
Mellow and profitable.
Wacka, wacka.
- Let's make a scene.
- Okay, hon.
- Watch the tree, Rowlf.
- Careful, Scooter.
Ow.
- Watch it!
- (MEEPS)
- Miss Piggy, you look beautiful.
- MISS PIGGY: Thank you.
Hollywood talk.
Wa ha ha ha.
Wa ha ha ha ha.
- Good.
- Wa ha!
The lights. Yeah.
Good. Save those arcs.
Ha, ha.
Crazy Harry plays with electricity!
Sound is ready. Give me a level.
(YELLS) Testing!
Rolling.
Okay, everybody. Stay in focus, huh?
Okay, Muppet Movie, scene 1A, take one.
- BEAKER: Makeup ready.
- FLOYD: Scenery ready.
- BUNSEN: Sound is rolling.
- ROWLF: Camera's rollin'.
MISS PIGGY: All ready, Kermie.
Okay, standby. Here we go.
(SINGING) Why are there so many songs about rainbows?
That's part of what rainbows do
Rainbows are memories
Sweet dream reminders
What is it you'd like to do?
All of us watching and wishing we'd find it
I've noticed you're watching, too
Someday you'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Kermit.
(SINGING) Life's like a movie
Write your own ending
Keep believing, keep pretending
We've done just what we've set out to do
Thanks to the lovers
The dreamers
And you
I just knew I'd catch up with you guys.
- What did you think?
- It was sick and weird.
Kermit, it went swell. It went great, boss.
Congratulations, Mr. The Frog.
You can be in the next one, Lew.
Great show.
Oh, wow.
Woman!
- Did you like my close-up?
- Oh, yes.
Did you like my song?
How about my karate?
Kermit. Oh, Kermie.
Was I funny? Was I funny, anybody?
Fozzie, you were very, very funny.
Just great.
Go home! Go home!
