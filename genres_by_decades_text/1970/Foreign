Jesus, the alarm didn't ring!
Get it fixed!
I'll miss the train.
I was awake, but I thought it was earlier.
It's so dark out.
It's cold as a morgue in here.
Marino will get a gas refill for the heater today.
Why didn't you get it yesterday?
Scared of honest sweat?
You're always picking on your brother-in-law.
You're his mother.
Tell him to go to work.
He tries, but he can't find anything.
He finds his way here to freeload all right.
Relatives have to help each other out.
At Christmas... he brought a box of food.
So now we wait for Easter-- if he isn't arrested first!
Nothing works!
Goddamn it!
I'll miss the train today.
They'll put me on the blacklist.
I'm sick of everything and everybody!
I'm not going anywhere!
Better to be a whore!
I can't take it anymore!
Always the same thing.
Always late.
And nobody else around here does anything.
A sick husband loafing around.
A senile mother-in-law, a brother-in-law who should... spend all his time in jail.
If I didn't have three kids,
I'd get out.
- She's gone crazy.
- Be quiet!
What a rotten life.
- Have your coffee.
- I don't want any!
And I won't wash either!
Some day you won't see me anymore.
Take the bike.
You'll save ten minutes.
- Where do I leave it?
- With the station master. Explain...
Explain what?
That you're a family... of bastards!
Look, his knee's still swollen.
Make him some compresses.
Here's the bottle.
Don't let it get infected.
Clara, I'm out of razor blades.
What should I do?
Buy some.
There are two eggplants.
Do I slice them or dice them?
Slice, dice, razor blades...
You always ask me everything.
What happens if I'm not around?
Clara, you forgot your lunch box.
I'll pick it up tonight. Thank you.
- Where were you?
- I was late.
I have to run.
I start at 7:30.
You stand.
Will you look at that?
What have they decided about the strike?
Who knows?
They screw you out of your raise by hiking prices.
Even the newspaper costs more.
The newspaper!
Who reads it anyway?
I do, for the robberies.
There's one every day.
A few less come summer.
Even robbers go on vacation.
- They never catch them!
- Are you sorry?
You in a bad mood today?
Yesterday, today...
The bottle for the compresses!
The kids might drink it!
It's poison!
It must have a skull and crossbones on it.
No, no. It doesn't.
Is your mother-in-law an idiot?
She loves the kids.
She'll be careful.
The compresses.
I hope so.
Hurry up, you girls!
You're always the last.
Don't make me laugh!
I'm not in the mood.
I've never missed a single day.
I'm too stupid to pretend I'm sick, like the others.
Look. Half of them are home.
They're smart! If you don't look out for yourself around here...
Come on, come on.
''Come on.''
You're a real pain.
Step it up, beautiful!
Come along!
You're always late.
Come here.
Come on. I'm worn out.
Let's go eat.
Don't you feel well?
I'm sleepy.
Go to sleep. Eat later.
Hey, come over here.
Stop! She's sick!
- It's nothing. I'm fine now.
- What happened?
What's the matter, Calabria?
I just felt sleepy.
It's passed. I'm okay now.
This is the second time you've done this.
- I'm just a little tired.
- What do you expect, working here?
Her husband wants her every night.
When you work, three times a week is enough!
She'd be pregnant all the time, like a gypsy!
She has to get up, fix herself up, do all the chores--
Shut up!
Mind your own goddamn business.
It's this noise, this stink of rubber.
This department's a killer.
If you can't take it, go someplace else.
It's 20,000 lire more a month here.
I earn what I need here.
Want me to lose my job?
I've never been sick, not even for a day.
I already told you... go and get an examination at National Health.
I don't need one.
Don't be foolish, Clara.
Get out of here.
Maybe they'll give you a few days off so you can sleep!
If only!
Take the tram.
You'll be there in half an hour.
Let us know what they find.
Come on, Clara. Get going.
Let's go see the foreman.
Bra, 2,200 lire.
Slip, 2,300 lire.
Nylon panties, 1 ,000 lire.
No stockings?
I can't afford anything else.
Oh, my God!
My head's spinning!
You can get sick just waiting here.
I've been waiting since 1 1 :00.
I have kidney stones.
Since 1 1 :00!
Number 39 to surgery.
Next year everything will change with the new reforms.
- You believe that?
- No, but I can hope.
If you get sick, they halve your pay instead of increasing it!
I'd like a checkup by an important doctor.
But it costs as much as a car.
I wouldn't go to one for free!
They're used to rich people's bodies.
With poor people, they'd mess up the diagnosis.
Sick people are all the same-- like dead people.
God forbid!
I mean better dead than sick if you haven't got the money.
- True. Shall we get a coffee?
- Thanks, I don't drink coffee.
I have an ulcer.
I better not.
Will you come, signora?
I don't want to lose my place.
I'm number 60.
I'm 59.
They won't call you before 4:00.
Trust me.
I know the ropes here.
There's a cafe nearby.
At least we can sit down.
Come on.
Number 40, to the dentist.
- Waiter.
- Yes?
What'll you have?
- I'm cold.
- A punch, then.
For me, warm milk.
My company deals with Olivetti.
Precision parts, to the hundredth of a millimeter.
I like it, but I have to hunch over all the time.
It ruined my health.
I've been in a sanatorium already.
And besides, the noise!
I run a machine at 1 80 decibels.
One hundred is enough to shatter your nerves.
Beautiful. It looks like a flower.
My work is less complicated, but it's tiring.
Take one.
I haven't smoked a cigarette in years.
I have to smoke mild ones.
Are you from the south?
Calabria, near Cosenza.
- Lots of Calabrians here in Milan.
- We should have stayed home.
On account of the climate?
On account of everything.
We had so many illusions when we set out.
I like your style.
You don't talk much.
When I start, I never stop.
I got it from my mother.
This punch really warms you up!
You have a family?
Yes, three children.
My husband was hit by a motorcycle in October.
He can't go back to his factory until May.
The children are a consolation.
It's better not to have them... if you have to deny them too much.
My mother sprained her arm.
She's really a character!
When she was young... she wanted to sing.
But my father was a tyrant.
I buy records for her now and then.
Do you like music?
What?
Music... do you like it?
Yes.
I don't know.
Excuse me. It's late.
- Come back tomorrow.
- Doctor, is something wrong?
You should have come sooner.
You're all so scared of doctors.
At the factory, if they find out you're sick, they fire you.
It's a horrible world.
What can I tell my family?
Why tell them anything?
Let us have a look at the x-rays first.
Sleep on it tonight.
She's home.
- How's your leg?
- It stopped hurting.
I made the compresses.
Back to school tomorrow.
I wanna stay home another day.
You better explain... right now, in front of everyone, in front of your children... or I'll smash your face in and kick you out of the house.
Who was that shit in the cafe?
I only told him what I saw.
Answer instead of crying.
Of course we think the worst.
You changed clothes!
You go to a cafe, smoke...
I haven't seen you smoke in years.
At home you play the victim.
You don't smoke.
And I don't laugh, either.
I went to the doctor's today.
I had x-rays.
I'm sick!
I can't take it anymore!
I hope I die.
I pray to God I'm rotting with TB!
You're trying to change the subject, but you can't fool me!
Who was that man in the cafe?
Who the hell knows?
What did this bastard tell you?
Is that all you care about my health?
You make a big jealous scene, but you don't give a damn about me!
Nobody cares about me! Nobody!
It's only a shadow, but it'll grow if we don't cure it.
I'm sending you to the mountains.
There you'll lay back... and think only of yourself.
A little vacation.
In two months you'll be cured.
Two months?
Two, four, three...
We'll see.
I can't. I can't go away.
No one is indispensable.
I look indispensable... but if I died, everything would go on-- probably better than before.
Excuse me, Doctor. Professor, couldn't she get well at home?
You have to help us.
We're poor folk.
Don't make me angry.
She's been running a fever for a month.
- What's your first name?
- Clara.
Clara, know where I'll send you?
Sandalo, in the mountains.
In the Vattelina region.
It's a nice place.
Are your deductions up to date?
- Yes.
- Then you won't pay a thing.
But the children, the family--
How will we manage?
Go and steal.
She could die if she doesn't get treated.
I'm not sure I'll go.
It's up to you.
I don't even have a decent pair of shoes.
I'd need at least 50,000 lire.
Who's got money like that?
Mama's right.
The doctor was exaggerating just to scare you.
That's his job.
You don't even have a cough... or any pain.
I feel a heaviness on my right side.
My grandmother died of this disease.
Who says you have the same thing?
I want to get well so the kids don't suffer.
You're turning this into a soap opera.
Please, Franco.
I don't really feel like it.
When do you ever?
Be good. Go to sleep.
I need rest.
The more I sleep... the sooner I'll get well.
Marissa could lend me the money.
So you've decided to go?
I'll decide tomorrow.
Come on, give me this satisfaction.
We have so few...
You move.
With this leg, I can't.
Are you mad because I slapped you?
No, I forgot all about it.
This is where the flatlands disappear.
Look, ma'am.
There they go.
Bye-bye, flatlands!
We're far from the world, alone and happy.
Is this your first time up here?
- Yes.
- It shows.
I come back every year.
I catch my breath, and then the sparks fly!
- You never laugh?
- No, I can laugh. See!
You have a marvelous smile.
If you'd just get that tooth fixed.
With 20 or 30,000 lire, you'd be perfect. Right?
I think she's perfect as she is.
Look at all the snow!
Man, do you sleep well up here!
Great beds!
Here I am!
Nice to see you again, Mariani.
- You're the singer!
- Singer, actress, dancer.
- Miss Saccani!
- Scanziani. ''Rita Goes'' on stage.
A pleasure.
Hiya, kids! I came up here mainly to see my friends.
I'm going abroad.
See how I remembered your name?
Who could forget me?
This year they've separated the men and the women.
You're in pavilion 7.
They did it because of me.
They're afraid I'll seduce you all.
Sandalo! We're in Sandalo!
A ten-minute bus ride... and we'll be in paradise!
A paradise I hope I'll soon be leaving.
Lucky you, Saccani.
Look,just call me by my stage name, will you?
These are so heavy!
Those furs too, please.
- What's your stage name?
- Rita Goes.
That's even tougher!
Hello and welcome, all.
This way.
First you must sign in.
This way, ma'am.
So long, ladies.
You'll be in our dreams.
So long, Saccani.
Scanziani!
Go jump in a lake!
That guy's got water on the brain!
Hello, Scanziani!
Hello, Doctor.
It takes ages to get up here!
It's hard on us poor invalids!
- Paying?
- Yes, paying.
- National Health, or paying?
- National Health.
- You?
- National Health.
- National Health?
- Yes, National Health.
National Health, Pavilion 8.
Paying, Pavilion 9.
- You're paying?
- Paying.
- National Health?
- National Health.
- National Health or paying?
- Paying, thank God!
Easy with those bags!
We have a Calabrian here.
Who's from Calabria?
From the same region as me.
From Rogliano. Who is it?
It's me.
Hello, Miss Scanziani. Your bags?
They're unloading them now.
Careful with that one!
I'll walk. I know the way.
Hello, Doctor.
How are you?
You have a guest.
Welcome.
Come on in.
You two will be in here.
This way, please.
This is your kingdom.
You're in charge here.
So far you're lucky.
You're alone.
Now unpack and get some rest.
Later we'll bring you whatever you'd like for dinner.
Just let us know any special requests.
Tomorrow morning we'll begin all the tests.
Azotemia, glycemia, radiology... cardiology, everything!
A previous patient left these behind.
Manzoni, Tolstoy.
- You like reading?
- I never had the time.
This is a lucky room.
Take your temperature.
Here are thermometer, pencil, and paper.
Always record your temperature.
Keep it under your tongue for five minutes.
Tomorrow you join community life with the others.
Once a week, you can go wherever you want.
If you need anything,just call.
Lights out at 9:00 p.m.
The director forgives everything but lost sleep. Bye-bye.
How are you?
You shouldn't read the papers.
Things are so bad, they'll raise your fever.
I read to forget.
If you only knew.
Married?
Lucky.
If I died here, my husband would give a party.
One night he told me...
''You're all skin and bones,'' and took a mistress.
When I put on weight again, am I going to cheat on him!
But I must admit... he's a pro at business... and a flop in bed.
Is that a novel?
Marx.
Oh, the guy with the beard!
I know he had a beard.
A real troublemaker, eh?
Did he really exist?
Seems so.
How's everything?
Fine, thanks.
After the tests, let's get together in the dining room.
I'm just fine!
It's your turn now.
Hold these, please.
God help me.
Come.
Breathe.
Cough.
Again.
Again.
Take a breath.
A deep breath.
Deeper.
We caught it in time.
You'll be fine.
You're sturdily built, a true Calabrian.
Now get that fanny in the air and I'll give you a shot.
- Darling, eat.
- I don't want to eat.
Drink your milk at least.
What a drag! Come on, eat!
Here's the Calabrian.
Come in.
She looks very sweet.
Breakfast is at 8:00.
Over there.
Morning.
Hey, come sit at our table.
Come on.
Have a seat.
- Are you in opera?
- No, musical theater.
There she is. She won't eat.
Enough of this nonsense now.
We let you get away with it yesterday, but not today.
Do you want to die?
Your fever's up.
Maybe she'd eat in her own room.
Right, Maria?
I understand her.
You can't give the heart orders.
A brioche?
At least an egg.
I'd rather die.
She's crazy.
Why? Poor thing fell in love with a doctor.
Where is he?
They transferred him immediately.
Women with our sickness are always-- what's the word?
In heat.
Right.
And men behave worse than rabbits.
I've always dominated ''that part'' with my head.
In my business, the more you screw, the worse you sing.
She's very sick.
She won't live out the year.
Does she know?
She knows.
But she doesn't know we know.
Come sit at my side; milord
Your heart is cold but I will warm it up
I'll bewitch and enchant you
Forget about her and taste my kisses
I know you well; milord
I know your type
Sooner or later you'll end up with me
Here they come!
''My dear husband, the doctor says
I must stay here until spring.''
- Everything all right?
-Just fine.
With all due respect, they're very old-fashioned here.
They don't realize that art-- and in all modesty
I call myself an artist-- has greater healing powers than the sun.
Look where we'll go first: the Orient.
Then Jerusalem.
The Wailing Wall.
But instead of wailing...
I'm going to laugh.
How's that for guts?
I want to tell him...
''Stop fooling yourself!.
Everybody's forgotten you!
Everyone!'' Am I right?
Yes, but we should be quiet now... or our lungs won't rest.
Don't worry.
It's just mines.
It sounds like guns.
Or bombs.
Wars can break out suddenly, you know.
Maybe in the past.
Now we wouldn't hear a sound.
''Everyone is very kind to me.''
The kid's already forgotten the first doctor.
Now she'll get this one fired, too.
Sooner or later you'll end up with me
And here I do a grandjete.
Clara, come up to my room.
We'll have a chat.
Look.
He fell in love with me at a fashion show.
He wanted to marry me.
I was ready, white dress and all.
But he already had a wife.
He manufactures cookies, but he loves art.
He makes millions.
Did you know there's no butter in butter cookies?
Don't cry.
If you get depressed, you'll get really sick, miss.
Call me by my first name.
I know men.
When they find out you're sick, they're understanding at first.
But when they see you using the thermometer all the time, they run.
- You love your husband?
- We married for love.
And now?
We're too poor to think about it.
Seven mouths to feed.
And that costs!
How much do you earn?
Just enough to keep us from starving.
My God!
If you won't be offended,
I'll give you a present.
Cologne for men. ''For Him.''
Ciro uses it and so do I.
It makes me feel close to him.
- Do you get hungry?
- All the time.
Then you'll get well soon.
But not too soon, I hope.
I'm happy here... and I'm ashamed because
I don't think of anything or anyone else.
You have a pretty face and a nice figure.
You could be in my line of work.
You're the one with the figure!
I can't walk like that.
Only certain women can do that.
- Try this on.
- Me?
Come on. Try it on.
There.
Take a step.
Walk over there and come back.
Stick your tummy out a bit, like this.
Not that much.
Less. Like this.
Look at those hands.
You need a complete overhaul!
Make yourself beautiful.
It's important for a woman.
I'll give you a manicure.
How can you be seen with those hands?
Come in.
Lights out was an hour ago.
I saw the light through the window.
What are you reading?
A classic.
Boring, eh?
I skip around sometimes.
It was hard at first, but now it's easier.
Just think.
We might have met in Rogliano... in the square... or up in the mountains.
I'd have noticed you.
Don't you ever go out?
Wednesday everybody goes for a walk or dancing. Don't you dance?
I used to.
Despite this body of mine,
I dance well.
The rhythm makes me giddy.
I've been invited to a concert.
- By whom?
- Scanziani.
She's nice.
Poor thing.
Well...
Now I have to make a tour of all the pavilions.
But first put out the light.
I want to see you put it out.
Good.
Sometime we'll go dancing together.
We'll have some fun.
Wouldn't you like that?
Dancing?
Good night.
Good night.
I'd love to take my trip with you all.
Why don't you come?
I'm leaving Saturday.
The director!
Nice car, Scanziani.
Expensive?
Terribly.
I saw it yesterday and bought it!
Damn whoever invented coughing.
Clara, why don't you ever say anything?
I like listening to you.
You all know so much.
Dr. Massari has a wonderful car.
If your fiance doesn't come for you, we'll run out of doctors.
I'll leave you Dr. Ciranni.
You're all mean to that poor man.
He's so nice.
Listen to the Calabrian defending him!
What do you mean?
You wouldn't sleep with him for a million dollars.
Who'd give a million for him?
The Calabrian Chamber of Commerce?
Hurry, or we'll be late for the concert.
How marvelous!
This is the world I belong in.
You don't recognize me?
Perhaps because you're much more beautiful now!
Why are you yelling?
- Guy lying there.
- Sure, must have fainted.
- Yes. Get some water!
- Yeah, water!
Man's fainted.
Water!
Water! Water!
Beer, you idiot.
Beer!
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WHEN YOU CATCH ME?
What's this?
You didn't bring the cards!
About the store-room key, I think it might be enough if just three people signed for it, not the whole commission.
- That's what I think.
- Very good idea.
Submit it to the proposals commission.
Even just two, actually.
One would keep a check on the other.
Very true.
Submit that too.
If it's taken up, you might get a bonus.
Here they are, chief.
I meant work cards, moron.
OK. OK.
These will do.
Yeah. It was like that then too.
The phone would ring...
...and ring... as if it wanted someone to answer it.
The cobweb was in the same place when the previous director was to get the chop. That Nareba.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Almost exactly like now.
- You don't say.
- I tell you.
And the bucket got knocked over just like now.
No kidding, really?
We're no strangers ourselves to import-limiting production.
We staked everything on modernity.
It proved to be the correct way.
This enabled us
to a considerable degree not only to stop imports...
Why are you taking notes?
He's on his way out.
- See the banquet he's laid on?
- Doesn't mean anything.
Dear chap, I've been in this for 20 years.
He's got a week left at most.
- You think?
- I don't think, I know.
As a result, our production limits imports and brings in valuable foreign currency
by, in a sense, exporting
- internally, for the present.
You'll find the rest in these folders.
Now our traditional snack.
You're late, I'm afraid.
But help yourself... sandwiches, chocolate...
There's even a folder there, with all the materials.
- Here, brandy.
- I've come about something else.
Right. How can I help?
I'm going to have a baby.
Ah yes, of course.
Sorry. I didn't know.
So, no brandy or any other liquor.
If you'll allow me, to the health of the future member of our community.
Community, yes, but you... are the father.
I'm afraid I don't recall...
Because it was last April.
15th, to be exact.
To be exact, on the 15th
I was in Paris.
Exactly. Paris.
- Mr... Gackowski.
- Krzakoski.
That's what I said.
I recognized you by your recognition sign.
This way.
Flowers cost the earth here.
But, you know - women...
After you.
- Mrugala, my pleasure.
- Krzakoski.
Here.
Good you brought the foliage.
Long time since we laid anything.
So, where to?
Chopin's grave, or statue of what's his name - Mickiewicz.
Go to the statue.
Who needs a tour of the cemeteries?
Szymek, the camera!
You know, good to have a record for posterity.
I'll fix this.
You hold that, please.
See? Can't understand a word.
Crazy country.
Stupid language.
For example, me - that's "moi".
But me, to him, isn't "moi", it's "vous".
But he to him is "moi".
But to me, he's "lui".
Go figure who's who.
They eat frogs.
- Hey, Szymek, what's frog in their lingo? - Grenouille.
Hear that?
Green wheel.
Good morning to respected sirs.
- How many computers it is?
- How much?
You say how many,
I tell how much.
Let's say... 50.
- That'll be 50 each.
- Make it 40.
That's 60 each.
Oh come on, Mr Newton.
The man's come from Poland.
All right, my loss it is.
Which ones you are wanting?
The lighter ones, Mr Newton.
Izaac! You finish your talk, for you is a schnitzel waiting.
So? Let him wait.
You tell him I'm coming already.
Just round the corner here are the best sales in Paris.
As regards fabrics, clothes, tights...
- ...and also...
- They're that way.
Where did he go?
No, don't misunderstand me.
It's just this, you know,
striking resemblance to a colleague of mine.
They're all alike, these colleagues.
Don't worry. We'll show you better ones.
Won't we?
We'll take some pictures.
- What pictures?
- For your mates.
Why waste your cash?
All women are basically the same.
That's right.
There's a reception at an art gallery tomorrow.
You can take your pick there. Free.
Get a better class of merchandise, eh, Szymek?
See all the talent that's around?
You go, Szymek will take a few photos.
There, a chocolate one, see?
You go up and say...
- what do you say, Szymek?
- Just anything. After all,
- there's no sound in a photo.
- Of course.
Just straight, in Polish.
"What's the time?"
And Szymek will click.
Szymek, show our visitor.
What's the time?
See? Can't understand a word.
Crazy country.
Stupid language.
- They're all duds!
- It's OK, we'll find a good one.
- Ah, there's one over there.
- I'd advise against that one.
- Phone call.
- Phone call? In Polish?
- In Polish.
- OK, I'll take it then.
I'm sorry to be so direct, but I've just arrived from Warsaw.
In my room I've the latest issues of "Przekroj" magazine.
Sorry.
Krzakoski's the name.
- So you're Dorotka.
- Danusia.
Of course. I knew it started with D.
Danusia.
Jesus, Mary.
They've killed a man.
- Excuse me, officer...
- One moment...
Well all right...
...but I'm in a hurry.
- Pardon?
- So, it's true we ran him over on a zebra crossing and with a red light.
Oh, Jesus.
- Yes, of course.
- Sorry to have troubled you.
Of course you may go.
Disperse, disperse!
Get up, citizen.
Want to catch cold?
Do come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. A drink?
No, thank you.
OK. You wait here a moment.
Come with me, madam.
Careful, dumb-head.
Careful.
Easy. Here, here.
Careful you don't break a light bulb again.
Come over here.
Careful.
For the doctor. Four legs and a kilo of lungs.
I'll give it to him.
You?
How do I know who you are?
I'll give it to him.
- Very sorry. What's your name?
- Lewandowska.
You've got meat, right?
I've got some pressed steel.
What about making ourselves a few tins for the winter?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
- You know who that is?
- Danusia.
- Danusia. You know her parents?
- No, as it happens.
We met in...
- But the surname, man!
- Don't you know? Krzakoski.
Hers, you idiot!
How was I to know?
I'd advise against that one.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Of course you may go.
I really appreciate it.
How do you mean, you'll marry me?
Of course. Got to think of the child.
Future citizen.
But then why did we go to that doctor?
Just wanted to make sure there's no mistake.
And there isn't.
A child needs a mother.
- It's got one.
- Mother and father.
Father's as important.
Even more, if the mother goes away somewhere.
That's why I believe
I ought to marry you.
- But you're married already.
- So?
My wife will like you.
Another one, kind of riddle:
What's the difference between a woman and a light bulb?
No, I don't know.
Well, a light bulb you screw first and turn on later...
I'm not in.
Dudala!
What can you tell me, Dudala?
- Difficult to say, sir.
- You think so?
How's the plan working out?
Plan, well... 96%.
Be honest.
Well...
Honest... 75%.
- Honest, I said.
- Honest...
Well, sir, who knows?
And the arbitration?
So, well... honest...
Yes.
You needn't tell me.
I can see we'll have to go our separate roads.
Separate roads?
- Who?
- Me and my wife, who else?
Great idea, sir.
Sit down.
You see, Dudala...
...if a man's to work well and productively
he needs to be calm and content on the home front.
He'll work better, and the workplace will be happier.
But domestic friction...
that affects everything... plans, production, men.
Your wife's having an affair, sir.
She is?
Who with?
Don't know yet, but that's the best grounds for divorce.
And she'll be the one at fault.
Go on, tell me more.
Is Mr Kwasniewski in?
No.
- Will he be in later?
- He's in, but somewhere in B3.
- Foreign. You know the lingo?
- No. Just reading.
One way of killing time,
I guess.
You want some? Mr Kwasniewski's got quite a lot.
No, no. I'll wait.
Hello! Yes.
The dark-room.
- Excuse me!
- Yes.
Could you ask Mr
Kwasniewski...
No, it's OK.
I'll tell him myself.
- Where did she go?
- Who?
Oh, to that guy, Kwasniewski.
Dark-room.
Kwasniewski, what a ladies man!
Yes, sir, a womaniser.
We went to this cafe once with Kwasniewski.
There was a girl with a guy.
And what Kwasniewski did, he...
Are we implementing technology?
Of course we are. But... it's not easy. Sometimes they deliver, sometimes they don't.
The ear.
- I've finished my shift now.
- Right.
- See that?
- What?
- Her ear.
- What about it?
Jesus! Don't you know he bites his women on the ear?
I remember clearly.
3 May. Forestry day.
- That's 3 March, I think.
- Maybe. Guy came up to us...
- Which way to the station?
- Straight ahead.
Reckon he'll make it in time?
Look, the younger generation.
We don't count any more.
We're just excess baggage.
We'd have enough to keep us both busy for two years.
No, two months.
And not both: One.
Talking's easy, doing's harder.
- So we made a bet.
- How much?
Nothing. Just honor.
OUR WORKPLACE:
HONOR AND PRIDE
- So? After two months...?
- Well...
But you wouldn't make out with a policewoman, would you?
Want a bet?
- Honor?
- No. 200 zloty.
That'll be a 200 zloty fine.
Excuse me? 200?
What for?
You want information?
That's an extra 50.
But I heard fines were being lifted as of today.
If that's what you heard then let's meet half-way.
You pay this last fine and after that they'll be lifted.
Let's meet by all means, but why only half-way?
- So that cost you 200.
- No, 400.
- There were two of them?
- One.
- So how come...?
- One...
So? Young man like you, you want to lose your legs?
- Both legs?
- You think it's funny?
50 zloty fine.
100 zloty.
And so?
Ended up paying 200.
There's no stopping him.
- Ah, the naivety of youth.
- You don't believe me?
No woman can resist him!
You can bet on him and make a fortune.
This is an authorisation for two members of staff to take a vacation in Bulgaria.
In the travel bureau it would cost 16 grand.
- You stake 4. Or 3, even.
- On what?
On Kwasniewski not making out.
- Who with?
- Good question.
Let's say, Mrs Krzakoska.
Director's wife.
Wait a moment.
Bye, bye.
OK.
Let's make the wager.
Olek will cut.
Right. You stake the vacation,
16. I stake 3.
- Tadeusz.
- Tad.
- Tad.
- Tadeusz.
- Tad, listen, this guy...
- Kwasniewski.
He'll confirm it all in court?
Come on, of course.
You'll have the proof, anyway.
The elastoplast on the ear.
You gone mad, Dudala?
What use is a bit of plaster?
I need proof.
Hard evidence.
Wait.
Maybe lengthways?
What about the head, then?
That'll do.
Where did you manage to get that carp, dear?
Brother-in-law brought it from Gdansk.
You going? So soon?
Soon? I should have been then there ages ago.
- What about the sandwiches?
- Haven't got time.
- Beatka, Beatka!
- Yes?
Dad's breakfast.
On the table.
Bring it down.
It's wrapped up.
Dad, Grzybczak spelt
"equal" with "kw".
And Miss said that was right.
OK, OK. You go on spelling it "qu".
L'ordre regne a Varsovie.
- Order reigns in Warsaw?
- Well, almost.
Listen, rely on people you know.
Not guys from outside.
- Drive you somewhere, sir?
- No thanks, I'll take mine.
Who's that guy, that photographer?
School mate.
A swot.
Always had top grades and it's all gone to waste.
I tell you. Kwasniewski will deliver the goods.
It's not me, it's the court.
I must have proof.
"Here are the photos, your honor".
- Yes, but you know...
- I know what I'm doing.
Let me see? What day is it?
Won't be back this evening.
He's gone to work.
To Emilia, he told me, the furniture store.
Oh right.
Thank you!
How did you find me here?
Listen. You made some photos, once, remember?
- No.
- You even came to my office.
- It was two years ago.
- You said you weren't in.
I said that? I must have been out, then.
Sometimes my hands are tied, you must understand.
But now there's an opening and you're my first choice.
- A pal's a pal.
- You said you weren't in.
Yes, well I'm in now.
It's all fixed. Contract, equipment, the works.
From today.
Today? I can't.
I'm in line.
- Furniture? I'll fix you up.
- It's not for me.
A guy pays, I stand in line for him.
Can't let him down.
Romek, a job needs doing,
I rush over straight away.
To my pal. Things aren't easy for me either.
I'll be frank.
My wife's having an affair.
That's how it goes.
Hey, wise guy!
Your ears glued up?
Hey you!
I'm talking to you!
You keep quiet. This man's wife is having an affair and you're yelling your mouth off, you moron!
Pass me Zygmus.
- Hello.
- Zygmus?
- Yes.
- Listen.
Come over to the Emilia store right away.
Bring a warm coat.
But... what am I going to do there, sir?
Put this gentleman down for the Kowalski suite, light pine, plus cabinet.
- Monday we settle.
- Monday?
Sure. 97th in line...
Today's Wednesday... could even be Saturday morning.
L'ordre regne a Varsovie.
Saturday?
You'll stand here until I relieve you.
Over there... no... my place.
I thought it was about a brochure.
Of course, brochure. Listen...
...come over.
Sorry.
I'll...
Sit down.
But this is an extrajob.
You know. Help out a pal.
- I see. But, you know...
- Actually, I'm fed up talking.
It's not just that, you know, she's cheating on me.
The worst thing is, during all this I have to keep smiling like it's all great between us,
I tell you I can't it much longer, this pretence.
- Come on. You're a man.
- Yeah? There are times...
- ...I just want to weep.
- Oh come on, surely not.
Help me, will you - I beg you.
Well, you know...
I suppose I could try.
Ready, Basia!
Basia. Mr Roman Ferde's employment card, third group, three months' back pay, sugar voucher allowance from January, working hours flexible, cameras always at Mr Ferde's disposal.
All yours.
"Our child's smile is our bonus for the chore of upbringing"
What's up?
Well?
No way.
All the lamp-posts are the same distance from each other.
Got to shorten it.
Sure.
I'd cut out "our" before "child's".
After all, we know whose kid.
Not necessarily.
I've got a friend, red hair, wife too, but the kid's dark.
Hair doesn't count.
No, it's his skin. Black, like you see in magazines.
Excuse me, wasn't Block 5,
3 May Street around here?
Maybe, once. We've had everything here.
Paris, London, Hamburg,
New York, Melbourne.
That balcony there, is where they threw the kangaroo.
- Yes, but...
- That's how it is every week.
Each week Fetting kills
Mrs Koczeska, and Chamiec unmasks them each Thursday. On TV.
It's driving me crazy.
- This yours? It was by the door.
- Yes, it's mine.
Great. Here are two for you.
- Shouldn't I hand them in there?
- No. Let's go.
- May I?
- One moment.
What's up? We stand here any longer, we'll starve to death.
You want us to starve?
I can't interfere with the inspection, can I?
What are they inspecting?
Checking for theft.
Bricks or whatever.
- But everything was stolen ages ago. - I know that.
I've made a rough check, sir.
OK. Now make a thorough one with the thinner tool.
There's a brick.
Write it down.
One brick.
What's this?
Stealing bricks, eh?
Throw it here.
Hey, there's a queue!
You want your mother's son to have a tooth missing?
- Just drive, then.
- Right.
- What do you say to that?
- Nothing.
And now?
Back from vacation!
Tanned!
Yes. All over.
I can show you.
Give me 3 minutes.
Credit where credit's due.
The boys are doing a good job.
Very good job.
Hell, he really whacked it.
- Get his number!
- Get it yourself. Hold on there.
Hold on? Can't you see how he bent it?
Sir, I think we'll have to sew the "our" back in.
You can do the sewing!
You can't tell a Chinese and a Japanese child apart.
Except by name, basically.
Chinese, Japanese.
Well, except when the Chinese is a boy, the Japanese a girl.
Then you can, by their sex.
Then they're like people.
Gentlemen, a few minutes of your time please.
I need your help.
Great stuff.
Great.
That's good as well.
Must be a leg.
His.
- Something got in the way.
- Flower-pot I think.
Yeah, a flower-pot.
Hey! That's my flat.
- My sofa-bed.
- Your wife too, I'm afraid.
What? You think I'm married to that fat sausage?
Maybe she put on weight after the wedding.
What is this crap?
- But it's your place.
- It's the maid.
- That's something, anyway.
- Got nothing else?
- What for?
- I'll go crazy, I swear.
I will.
Ah, Dudala.
Tad. Listen.
You've got to fix me up again with this Kwasniewski. Today.
- No way.
- Come to my office. Come on.
Come on, don't be shy.
Listen, Tad.
Get this Kwasniewski guy for me again. Today.
Can't. He's gone abroad for an assembly job.
OK, telex, cable him...
...phone. Get him to come back just for a day.
- One day, from Korea?
- Why did he go to Korea?
- We signed the deal, remember?
- We?!
We. We drank that snake liquor they brought over.
I remember now.
Turns out to have been an economically unsound decision.
Sir.
Personnel to see you, sir.
Still here?
Off you go.
Ready.
They're here, sir
You see Dudala - I mean, Tad, you view things like this.
You lack all-round vision.
Kwasniewski is not indispensable.
Kwasniewski is a great one for the girls. OK.
But he's not here. And your reaction? You're lost.
Mine? There's more where he came from, and I'll find them.
Watch me, and learn.
- Do you pay your alimony?
- We do!
Well go on paying, honest citizens.
What you got?
Calendar?
- Direcor's giving them out.
- What year?
Last year.
Sir, sir, could I have a calendar like that?
Many thanks.
I've been waiting for a month.
Take a seat.
One moment.
- A month, you say?
- Correct.
Wrong. Not a month.
37 days.
- So that's longer.
- So you misled me.
37 days.
If you've waited so long, you can wait one day more.
I'm to wait another day, while he's only just...
One moment.
You're my guest, so let me speak.
This gentleman's car was brought in 8 hours ago.
So for him, one more day is 300 percent more time.
- Yes, but...
- Is it, or isn't it?
- Well... yes.
- So one day more if you've been waiting 37 days... that'll come to...
...well, however you do it...
- for you, it's 3 percent
2.72 to be exact.
That's a tolerable margin.
But 300 percent, no way.
We've got be cost-productive.
So thank you, and goodbye.
Sir, the invoice is to be made out to the firm?
Yes. Accounts will send the transfer. And this is for you.
Thank you.
My dear fellow.
Give your Tad a kiss.
- Everything's fine.
- Get in. I'll give you a lift.
Shall I wait?
Go back to the workplace.
I'll go with the director.
- I'm not going far.
- Identity card, please.
Got a pass here somewhere.
With a photo, even.
Take it easy.
Holy Teresa.
- My wife?
- Yes. Your wife, and him.
- At least tell me who he is.
- Can't.
Believe me, I can't.
I can only tell you that
- they, you know. For sure.
- But if I could just know...
I simply can't.
You know I'd do anything for you.
But not this.
I promised.
I can just tell you this, though I shouldn't.
His initials are RF.
RF.
So his first name starts with F?
I don't know, don't know.
Why did you stop at the crossing?
Pull over, with your license.
And you, roll up that crossing.
You're creating confusion.
Commuting's no problem.
I get up early.
2:45 a.m.
Summer, it's dawn.
2:45, I'm shaved, because
I shave the evening before.
I've had breakfast for supper.
I just get up and go.
Well, you get dressed.
Put on a coat if it rains.
- What's the point of changing after breakfast? - True.
Got 5 km to the bus stop.
Bus comes at 3:45.
You get there in time?
No, but that's OK.
It's full up anyway, won't stop.
I walk to the dairy.
That's an hour.
Then high speed to Szymanow.
Quickest transport, milk-truck.
Milk goes sour otherwise.
Szymanow, I unload the milk-churns, get the train.
Ochota, take the local to the stadium.
After that it's a piece of cake.
119 bus, then the 13, then the 345 and I'm at work.
But it's only 6:45 a.m., so I've got 15 minutes for lunch in the buffet.
So I don't need to hang around after work. I'm back home
no later than 22:50.
I shave, have breakfast, go to bed.
Citizen tailors are asked
to supply more gimp for poster-hanging.
Gentlemen, would you step over here for a moment?
Just for a moment.
I'm behind you.
I'm before you, right?
Together, please.
Good.
Look left.
Now right.
- Arm up.
- Me?
Yes, up.
Back to the right.
Thank you. Fine.
Thank you.
I wonder when they'll open those tills.
Let them worry about that.
This was my place, right?
Thank you.
Your attention please.
Because of the railway poster exhibit
"Train travel saves time",
the station will be inoperative until further notice.
We wish our passengers a pleasant journey.
Apartment 107 for Pol-Pim is at your disposal.
And now, a great idea by our
Useful Plastic Arts Workshop:
A railway poster exhibit...
Look, now!
..."Train travel saves time".
Aptly named, and as we can see
hugely popular with the public.
The exhibition's commissar:
Anna Krzakoska.
That's her, my Anna!
We pared our slogan down.
In full, it'd have been:
"Railway travel cuts the time of travelling by train".
Slim, isn't she?
But advanced societies don't need to spell things out.
- Absolutely.
- There, see?
Sometimes, ellipsis is appropriate.
In view of the educational value of such initiatives,
the station's inoperability is now extended to 1 month.
Another mutual bull's eye for railwaymen and artists.
- You see that?
- I saw that.
Maciek?
It's me.
I wanted to thank you for the show and especially the TV report.
It was a great help.
Yes.
See you.
Could I stay here a little bit longer?
Sure.
In pre-war economic and
social reality, backward
in terms of both principles and
infrastructure, one aspect was particularly unproductive
and poorly planned:
The balance of protein.
This, as is well known, is a crucial determinant
in the economic efficiency in any society and also
provides clear testimony to the manner in which
such issues are guaranteed.
You spying on your woman?
No, a friend's.
A friend like that I wouldn't touch with a barge-pole.
Has his woman spied on.
They make it all up, anyway.
Make it all up?
Guy came to me once, name of Crow got me to follow his woman around, paid me a grand.
- A grand a month?
- You stupid? A day.
He said if I caught her at it
I was to call him immediately.
For a week, I did everything
I could to nail her on the job.
- Bed-hopper, was she?
- Like a frog! Guess who with?
- This Crow.
- Frog with crow?
It's been known.
Frog with crow, eh?
No, I've told it wrong. I'll tell you about the next one.
This one, she started going out of the house regularly.
Once, she took 12 sandwiches and was out the door.
Hey watch it, for Chrissake, you're spilling the stuff.
The husband says, where are you going? She just blushes.
He waited one day, two, a week.
Then one day he followed her.
She went to the station, got on a train.
He jumped on too, different carriage. When she got off, he followed. She headed for the bushes, began stripping.
That's too bad.
- She stripped completely?
- Totally nude.
Then she put on a track-suit and raced round the wood.
4 hours. He followed. Then she had her 12 sandwiches.
And 5 hours more running.
What the hell for?
Co-op relay team. She was too embarrassed to tell him.
Happy ending, then.
Happy? Day later, the guy pegged it.
Not surprising. 9 hours running without a bite to eat.
There she is!
- That one? You're wasting your time! - You think so?
Of course. She's too young to be having an affair.
- Too young?
- Of course.
Women start that after 60 when it's too late.
She's making it up!
You think she's too young, too?
I only think one thing.
I wish?
I could drive a cab in New York.
But there's a lot of traffic there.
In America?
Not just traffic.
There's social inequality, trusts, cartels, and the supremacy of big business.
But at least when one car chases another, they go hell for leather.
Not like here.
Slow down, or might take off!
No way. Don't care if it's double or triple the fare.
I'm not going.
The car's overheating, my head hurts, my hair's growing.
- What's that?
- My nerves are cracking.
Sister, please check the dressing and tools.
All counted.
Present and correct.
Dressing please.
Ladies and gentlemen. The Kutno team has finished its operation.
Yes. Surgery completed.
Gorzow are still operating.
What's the jury's verdict?
Nine points for the surgical team from Kutno.
Eight points for Gorzow.
This random patient business is a big con.
Guy we got was so fat I knew we'd lose as soon as I saw him.
By the time I'd got through the fatty layer they were already operating.
Yes, yes...
It'll turn in your favor.
It'll show you're strong and not afraid of rumours.
Everyone says you're on your way out, but you don't give?
A damn, you're on your way, but to Hungary, personally to oversee assembly.
And it gives your wife a new opportunity.
With you in Hungary, she can really start partying.
What's wrong with the taxi?
- Partying?
- You know what I mean.
In the meantime...
We wait for her to move.
Then - click.
He threw you out?
Did you get his number?
Even supposing you stayed put and caught them - so what?
You're in the doorway, she's in bed, he's in the wardrobe...
It looks like something from a cheap pre-war capitalist novel.
Now look at it this way.
While the husband is in a fraternal country having sleepless nights as he oversees assembly...
- Right, I understand.
- His wife has sleepless nights for an entirely different reason.
How does that sound?
"Sokol" sports club?
- The president, please.
- Look, look...
- Wacek?
- Listen...
Legs up! You're lagging behind!
Go on! Pedal harder!
- Maciek!
- What?
- I need one right away.
- Cyclist?
- No, bike! The best.
- I can't!
- President's orders. Quick!
- OK then.
Kowalczyk! Pull over!
What're you waiting for?
Pull up off the road!
Kowalczyk...
Get off.
Hand over the bike.
On top!
- See you!
- Bye!
Sir! Sir!
Wait! Wait!
Question for the Zabrze team.
"What's the latest percentage"
"increase in the number of hospital beds?"
7218 hours.
Correct... except it's the answer to question 3 which I haven't read out yet.
Question 3 goes:
How many free hours has the health service donated??
But I trust the jury will accept the advance answer.
Yes, the jury accepts.
Everyone has dreams, desires, something they'd like to see or hear.
Mrs Wnuk has cleaned hospital wards for many years.
What would you like to hear most?
Mr Koracz's song
"About Health" is what I would like to hear most.
By a happy coincidence
Mr Koracz is here with us.
# What can I tell you #
# or, rather, sing #
# You can't beat health #
# it's the best thing. #
I was 8000 zloty short.
I mean, it's a bargain, original Afghan coat...
Who's selling?
This Turk, see, the food-store manager told me about him.
Hey, listen.
Come round this evening.
I'll try and have it.
For sure. See you.
# All day #
# Chases disease away. #
- Are you last in line?
- Yes.
I'll be behind you, then.
Excuse me, it's no smoking.
I know, but I'm not inhaling.
Can't pay you. Your photo doesn't match your face.
Obviously. That's my brother-in-law's ID.
Give me just 500 zloty, eh?
I can give you 200.
- You want that?
- All right, then.
It's me.
Just one thing.
Well two, actually.
I've talked about this with two, let's say, experts.
And these women just make it all up.
All of them.
Yours too.
Experts? What are you talking about?
Apparently they never actually - you know.
- And facts confirm this.
- Did you catch her at it?
That's what I'm saying, no.
But nothing's sure yet.
I'll take some pictures of her.
Reckon you'll be pleased.
Give me a couple of days.
Oh by the way, I can't hack it with that bike.
I'm too slow, bike's too fast.
Excuse me, any chance of turning that radio down?
Can't make it any quieter.
I'll have to make it louder.
Thanks ever so much.
- I'm here.
- So I see.
Wait here.
You know, when you phoned me,
I didn't feel like it much, but then I thought... so here I am.
I really appreciate that.
Where are you flying, anyway?
Assembly, you know.
Personal supervision.
People's Republic of Hungary.
Would you do anything for me?
- Of course, darling.
- Stand like this, then.
Thank you.
Hey! Is this meal-time, or work?
NOT IN SERVICE
What's up?
Got to get some planks over to Zyrardow.
Can do 7 o'clock.
7, it'll be ashes, not planks.
It's got to be now.
- Now? Where's the fire?
- There isn't one yet.
There will be by 7, probably.
OK. But what can I do?
I'm full up.
Dump it here for a couple of hours.
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?
There's a queue.
- I don't want the queue.
- Well I'm queuing, just for wine.
- Where's the manager's office?
- I don't know.
There's a queue.
I'm not blind.
But deaf, maybe.
I tell you there's a queue and you push in.
I'm talking to you.
What's all this patting?
You a doctor?
- You weren't standing here.
- Listen, get on the 125 bus, go to Castle Square, tell
King Zygmunt on his column
"you weren't standing here".
- Here... you and your 125 bus.
- You asshole.
Why don't you quit bothering decent people?
- What's up with you?
- Take your hand off!
Look what they did there, sir. And here.
Slawek!
Over here a minute, please.
THESE CUSTOMERS
ARE BANNED
- What's up?
- Quick, quick.
Excuse a moment.
Slawek, shoot!
And straight on our display.
Fella! If you want... take that 125 and stuff it.
Up your ass!
So where's this 125, citizen?
- Well, 124, officer.
- ID, please.
Miss Wiesia, can you pass me a chicken?
Hold on.
The Turk? I know about him.
He'll be...
- The Turk will be...
- Excuse me, madam, are you the manager?
The cleaning lady used a dirty cloth handling the chicken.
I'm the manager.
He just snatched that chicken from me like a hooligan.
It was crucial evidence.
And he snatched my cloth.
My work-tool.
Sir, he wanted to steal that chicken.
Of course, why else?
The man's a thief.
And a drunk. Because all drunks are thieves.
Tell me yourself.
Is that acceptable?
- Kaz, calm down.
- Here. Dirty cloth.
That's what cloths are for... to be dirty.
Basic hygiene...
Basic hygiene is about knocking before you enter.
You didn't knock.
And you had a dirty cloth.
- I won't be buying here any more.
- Kaz, wait!
Sir, he's offended all the stores.
From Sluzewiec, where we live, up to Zoliborz.
This is the last store.
After this, we'll have to go out to Bielany.
I'll go as far as Bydgoszcz rather than buy here...
Go on, put me up on your display.
We decide who goes on the display.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.
- And what about now?
- Slawek!
Next time you have an opinion on our trade, think it through.
Surname?
I'm just thinking it through.
Kaz, you're irrational.
You're demanding things they know nothing about.
Darling, they can kiss my ass.
They know about that, at least.
- Over here, please.
- Me?
I tell you, last week I left my car in a guarded car park and they stole the wipers and a wheel.
Now I went in to buy margarine, and the idiots put a dam up.
Should write to the press.
Can't wait.
Well I drive, just as you do, never had anything stolen, and I'm never laid.
- Late.
- Exactly, laid.
Ass-ig-na-tion.
Director Kolodziej here.
Stefan Wisiorny speaking.
Got any cranes on the site?
Got one.
Send it over to me for an hour, will you?
I can't.
We're expecting a surprise inspection.
Got to work.
Take an hour out for a mass rally.
About Lebanon.
No harm in doing that.
Central Station, please.
We need prefabs to build new houses for the people.
Reality imposes problems and we have to solve them.
Ready. Yours? OK.
- Up.
- Go. Go. Go.
Right! Go! Up!
It's a cabriolet.
Will members of the friendship trip please board the coach.
Faster, faster.
Excuse me, is Mr Mustafa in?
- Mr Mustafa is not in, as such.
- And where would...?
He ordered a wake-up call in two hours? Time.
- Thank you.
- At your service.
Please!
It's open.
Harder!
Please!
Sorry. I believe you ordered a beer.
I am very sorry but your suspicions are totally unfounded.
I'm not trading in anything.
The lady arrived in this coat and is leaving in same.
Hello, it's about a coat?
Your suspicions are totally unfounded.
I'm not trading in anything.
The lady arrived in this coat and is leaving in same.
33, 34, 35...
36, 37, 38...
42, 43, 44...
- I'm going to Nasielsko.
- 45, 46...
- What's the problem?
- I'll tell you.
Can I have a look at that wheel?
Inflatable, recreational object.
- ID!
- ID? Why?
15 metres from the perimeter is a public right of way.
Anyway, I suggest you read the minister's decree of
27 December.
Number 1789.
Yeah. I'll read, and you'll slither by. ID.
Here you are.
Fine, go ahead.
Excuse me, is there a fitness course or running track here?
Ask the manager.
Karolka, come round the back of the laundry.
Come in.
- You just?
- You needn't have bothered.
I have the second one.
Excuse me...
I would like... telephone... Warsaw.
- No Warsaw.
- It's been destroyed?
So we're just going to stay silent?
Why don't you say something?
I'm thinking.
It's all turned out so unexpectedly.
Not unexpectedly at all.
You followed and followed me.
All the time.
You must be very shy.
And women like to be adored.
Helen, come home at once.
Got to finish flat 12!
Quit wandering around with that short-ass.
Come home or I'll tell your parents!
If it was a regular guy...
But he's a short-ass.
And a womaniser.
I tell you, yesterday he was trying it on with the cooks.
One was making dumplings and he just comes up from behind, friggin' short-ass.
Me, short-ass?!
Third World, see?
Third World.
That's what I call a feasible project.
Take an African, give him two lighters, tape-recorder even.
Or two tape-recorders.
Excellent these plays you write here in Hungary.
So he grabs her and...
He's rid of her once and for all.
No need for divorce.
I'm very sorry.
Aha, so it's you.
No it's not me.
Fijalkowski.
Lawyer.
In charge of your wife's divorce case.
How do you mean:
Apartment and car?
You misheard. Apartment, car and savings account.
- Which savings account?
- Both.
I'll give you a lift.
You can't prove that!
I hope you won't force me to.
Doesn't look good in court... cynical exploitation of
- professional status...
- But where's the evidence?
The name Kwasniewski mean anything to you?
You're a smart guy.
Give me a call midday tomorrow.
Not midday, morning.
And you call me.
Look, he's coming!
He's put on even more weight.
- Quiet. I can see.
- Can't do up his belt.
He's gotten so fat, he puffs as he walks.
Wait till he sees his office.
Then he'll start puffing.
How much sausage is this meant to be? 150, 200 grams?
How can it be 200?
Look, those scales start at 50.
Excuse me, I got up at 5.
I've missed three trams and you're standing here griping.
So what?
I got up at 4 and
I've missed six trams.
- No way am I taking that.
- What's going on here?
Pushes in and now he's got the nerve to say they're cheating.
Don't give that to me.
Maybe it's to someone else's taste. Have a look. Look!
Do I have to eat this? No,
I'll just get something to drink.
Dudala!
Tad.
No! Really, we're most grateful.
Oh, you haven't met.
My wife.
Must meet up some time, maybe.
Maybe next month.
So short of time these days.
Mr Director, Sir, what time will you be needing the car?
3 p.m.
What's going on...
...in the name of God?
Changes, changes, changes.
So this mate of mine followed her around, got to know her, and...
...you know what? Turned out she was quite different from
what the husband had told him.
He was just jealous.
Sick with jealousy, like Othello.
- You seen Othello?
- Where?
- OK, you haven't.
- How do you know I haven't?
And it turned out she was unhappy in marriage.
She needed, you know, warmth, sympathy, trust.
You follow?
Now she's divorcing him, says he's too primitive.
My mate, he sees all this, he's a bright guy.
He loves her, it's what she deserves.
But he's also got a wife and two kids.
So he doesn't know either.
You know?
What would you do in my place?
Stop! Stop!
Damn you...
When I catch you...
What will you do when you catch me?
You hear that, dad?
You see, son, on midsummer's night the fern flower blooms, which it doesn't normally because it has spores.
Cows, horses, pigs speak in human tongue.
- Isn't that on Christmas Eve?
- Only for Catholic animals.
THE END

[door opens]
[door slams]
[ringing]
[door opens]
[door opens]
[footsteps approaching]
What... What I find most astonishing...
[laughs]
...aside from that belief of mine, which never ceases to surprise me by the very fact of its surprising lack of unpleasantness,
the belief that I might very easily, as they say, lose my mind one day.
Not that I suspect I am about to or am even nearby.
There is no saner woman on Earth, Agnes.
[laughs] For I'm not that sort.
Merely that it is not beyond happening, some gentle loosening of the moorings sending the balloon adrift.
And I think that is the only outweighing thing.
Adrift. [sighs]
I'm becoming a stranger in the world.
Quite uninvolved.
But I never see It as violent.
Only a drifting.
What are you looking for, Tobias?
We'll all go mad before you.
[laughs] Me and the staff,
[laughs]
Thank you, darling.
What I find most astonishing, aside, as I said, from that speculation...
[laughs] And I wonder, too, sometimes, if I'm the only one of you to admit it,
not that I may go mad, but that each of you wonders if each of you might not.
Why on earth do you want the anisette?
[Tobias] I thought it might be nice.
Sticky. I'll do cognac.
It's supposed to be healthy.
The speculation... or, the assumption, I suppose, that if it occurs to you that you might be, then you're not.
But I've never been much comforted by it.
Follows, to my mind, that since I speculate,
I might, someday, or early evening, I think more likely, some autumn dusk, go quite mad, then I very well might.
Some autumn dusk.
Tobias, at his desk, looks up from all those awful bills and sees his Agnes mad as a hatter.
[laughs] Chewing the ribbons on her chest.
- Cognac.
- Yes.
Agnes, sitting by the fire, her mouth full of ribbons, her mind aloft, adrift.
Nothing to do with the poor old thing but put her in a bin somewhere.
Sell the house, move to Tucson, say, and pine in the good sun, and live to be 104,
Thank you, darling.
Tobias) Cognac is sticky, too.
Mm, but it's nicer.
Sit by me, hmm?
To my mad lady, ribbons dangling.
[Agnes laughs]
And, of course,
I haven't worn the ribbon dress since Julia's remarried.
Second?
No, no, no, first.
Tom, not, uh...
Not, uh, uh, Charlie.
Comfortable?
For a little.
What astonishes me most... aside from my theoretically healthy fear--
No, not fear. How silly of me.
Healthy speculation that I might someday become an embarrassment to you.
What I find most astonishing in this world and with all my years is Claire.
- Claire? Why?
- That anyone, be they one's sister or not, could be so, well,
I don't want to use an unkind word,
'cause we're, we're, we're, we're cozy here, aren't we?
Maybe.
As the saying has it, the one thing sharper than a serpent's tooth is a sister's ingratitude.
- The saying does not have it that way.
- It should.
Why are you moving?
- It's getting uncomfortable.
- [laughs]
Things get hot, move off, huh?
Yes?
I'm not as young as either of us once was.
[Agnes] I'm as young as the day I married you.
Though I'm certain I don't look it.
'Cause you're a very good husband... most of the time.
But [ was talking about Claire, or was beginning to.
Yes, you were.
161 were to list the mountain of my burdens, if I had a thick pad and a month to spare, that bending my shoulders most,
with 3, with a possible exception of Julia's trouble with marriage, would be your...
[sighs]
It must be instinctive, I think, or reflex, that's more like it.
Your reflex defense of everything that Claire--
Stop it, Agnes.
You gonna throw something at me?
A glass?
My goodness, I hope not.
[snorts]
That's awful anisette all over everything.
- No.
- What then?
I shall sit very quietly.
- As always?
- Yes.
And I shall will you to apologize to your sister
-for what I must in truth tell you--
- Apologize? To Claire?
To Claire?
I've spent my adult life apologizing for her.
I will not double the humiliation by apologizing to her.
One does not apologize to those for whom one must.
Ha ha. Neat.
Ha ha, succinct, but one of the rules of an aphorism.
An epigram, I thought.
An epigram is usually satiric, and you--
And I am grimly serious, yes.
I fear so.
[both laugh]
To revert.
Specifically... from Claire to her effect.
What would you do were 110 spill my marbles?
Put you in 2 bin somewhere, sell the house, and move to Tucson.
Pine in the hot sun and live forever,
[laughs] I bet you would.
- Hurry, though.
- Oh, I'll try.
Won't be a simple paranoia, though,
I know that.
I've tried so hard to.
You know how little I've dared it.
Goodness. I can't even raise my voice except in the most spectacular of events.
And I find that, uh...
I find that both... joy and sorrow work their wonders on me... more evenly, slowly, within, than most.
A suntan rather than a scalding.
There are no mountains in my life, no chasms.
It is a rolling... pleasant land.
Verdant, my darling.
Thank you.
We do what we can.
[laughs] Our motto.
If we should ever go downhill, join things, we must have that put in Latin.
Our motto:
"We do what we can."
On your blazers, over the mantel.
Maybe we can do it in the linen as well.
Do you think I should go to Claire's room?
No.
Either she will be down or not.
I thought Claire was much better tonight.
I didn't see any need for you to give her such a going over.
[Agnes] Claire was not better tonight, honestly, Tobias.
I thought she was.
[Agnes] Well, she was not.
[Tobias] Still...
I've decided... all things considered... that I shall not induce that all the years we've put up with each other's wiles and crotchets have earned us each other's company.
And I promise you as well that I shall think good thoughts, healthy ones, positive, to ward off madness should it come by uninvited.
You mean I have no hope of Tucson?
[chuckles]
- None.
- Alas.
You have the hope only of growing even older than you are in the company of your steady wife, your alcoholic sister-in-law, and occasional visits from our melancholy Julia.
That is what you'll have, my dear Tobias.
Will it do?
It will do.
I've never doubted that it would.
[door opens]
Hark.
Did I hear someone?
[footsteps approaching]
[Tobias] Ah, there you are.
I said to Agnes just a moment ago that...
I must apologize, Agnes.
I'm very sorry.
[Agnes] But, uh, what are you sorry for, Claire?
That my nature is such as to bring out the full force of your brutality.
Look now, I think we can do without--
If you come to the dinner table unsteady, if when you try to say, "Good evening, and weren't the autumn colors lovely today?" you are nothing but vowels; if one smells the vodka on you from across the room, and don't tell me again, either of you, that vodka leaves nothing on the breath, if you're expecting it, if you are sadly and wearily expecting it, it does.
If these conditions exist, persist, then the reaction of one who is burdened by her love is not brutality, though it would be excused, believe me.
Not brutality at all but the souring side of love.
If I scold, it is because I wish I needn't.
11 am sharp, it is because I'm neither less nor more than human.
And if I am to be accused, once again, of making too much of things, let me remind you that it is my manner and not the matter.
I apologize for being articulate.
Tobias, I'm going to call Julia, I think.
Ts it one or two hours difference?
I can never recall.
[Tobias] Three.
Ah, yes, well, be kind to Claire, dear.
She is injured.
[Tobias] Ah, well.
[door closes]
I never know whether to applaud or cry.
Or, rather, which would be more appreciated.
Expected.
You are a great damn fool.
Mm. Yes. Why is she calling Julia?
Do you want a quick brandy before she comes back?
Not at all.
A public one.
Fill the balloon half full, and I shall sip it ladylike.
And when she comes gliding in,
I shall lie on the floor, balance the glass on my head, which will give her occasion for another paragraph, and you, your ineffectual "Stop it now!"
You are a great damn fool.
[Claire] Is Julia having another divorce?
Hell, I don't know.
She's only your daughter.
Thank you.
I imagine, from what I have watched, that it is come home time.
Why don't you kill Agnes?
Oh-ho-ho, no. I couldn't do that.
[both laugh]
Well, better still, why don't you wait till Julia separates and comes home all confused and sullen and take a gun and blow all our heads off.
Agnes first, through respect, of course.
Then poor Julia, and, if you have the kindness for it, me.
You really want me to shoot you?
Shoot Agnes first and I'll think about it.
But it would have to be an act of passion.
Out of my head and all that.
I doubt I could stand around with a gun smoking,
Julia locked in her room screaming, and wait for you to decide if you wanted it or not.
But if you don't shoot Agnes, how do I know whether I want to live?
An act of passion.
[laughs]
Well, yes.
Oh, that is funny. [laughs]
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry, darling Tobias.
I just can't see you playing the role, that's all.
Outraged, maddened into action.
Proceeding by reflex.
Standing there in front of the judge.
Stolid, predictable Tobias.
"It all went blank, Your Honor.
There I was, sitting deep in my chair, sipping my..."
What is that?
Anisette.
Anisette? Really? Anisette?
-I like it.
- Sticky.
"There I was, Your Honor, sitting in my chair, sipping my anisette,
and the next thing I know they're all lying in separate rooms with their heads blown off.
I have absolutely no recollection of it."
[laughs] Can you imagine that, Tobias?
Of course, if you were all dead, your brains lying around in the rugs, there would be no one to say that it wasn't an act of passion.
Leave me to last.
A breeze may rise and stir the ashes.
Who Is that?
No one, I think, though it should be.
Why don't you go back to your... thing, your alcoholics thing.
Because I didn't like the people.
What's it called?
- Anonymous.
- Yes, that. Why don't you go back?
Why don't you mind your own hooting business?
I'm sorry, Claire.
Because.
It was better.
Be 2 good brother-in-law.
It's only the first one
I'm not supposed to have.
I thought it was better.
Thank you.
You mean Agnes thought it was better.
No, I thought so, too, that it would be.
I told you, not our type, nothing in common with them.
Do you remember when you used to go off to business before you became a squire parading around in your jodhpurs,
-confusing the gardener--
-I have never done any such thing.
Before all that, when you used to spend all your time in town with your business friends, your indistinguishable, if not necessarily similar, friends.
What did you have in common with them?
Well, everything.
Our business, we all mixed well, we're friends away from the office, too.
Clubs, our-- And environment, I guess.
Mm-hmm.
But what did you have in common with them?
Even Harry.
Your best friend in all the world, as far as you know, because you haven't met everyone.
You switching from anisette?
It doesn't go for a long time.
- All right?
- Doesn't matter to me.
Even your dearest friend, Harry.
Tell me, dear Tobias... what did you have in common with him?
- Please, Claire.
- What do you have in common with him?
Outside of the coincidence of having cheated on your wives in the same summer with the same woman.
Girl? Woman?
What except that?
Hardly a distinction.
I believe she was upended the whole of July.
If you'll forgive me, Claire, common practice is hardly my--
Ah, that poor girl, whatever she was, upended the whole of that very hot, wet July.
The distinction would have been to have not... to have been the one or two of the very, very, oh, God, many similar... who did not upend that poor unfamiliar thing that dry, very wet July--
Please, Agnes.
Of course, you only had the wanton once, while dear friend Harry,
I have it from the horse's mouth, was on top for good and keeps twice.
And a third try that wasn't so hot in the gardener's shed
-amongst the mulch and whatever it is--
- Shut your mouth!
All right.
What was her name?
I don't remember.
Doesn't matter.
She's gone.
Would you give dear friend Harry the shirt off your back?
I suppose I would.
He is my best friend.
How sad does that make you?
Not much. Some.
Not much.
No one to listen to Bruckner with, no one to tell you that your sick of golf.
No one to tell you that, at times... you're suddenly... frightened and you don't know why.
Frightened?
No.
All right.
Shall I tell you [sighs] what happened the last time I... climbed the steps to that fancy alky club?
Why I have not gone back and what I have not in common with those people?
-[Tobias] Sure.
- Oh, poor Tobias.
Sure. Light me a cigarette.
And then I shall have everything I need.
A sip, a smoke, and a good hard surface.
[Tobias] Comfy?
Very.
Do you remember the spring I moved out?
When I was so sick with this stuff?
Drinking like the familiar fish, which was such an embarrassment to everyone, and you and Agnes moved me to that apartment near the station?
And Agnes was so very good about coming to see me?
-[exhales sharply]
- Sorry.
When will it all just go in the past, forget itself?
When all the defeats are done, admitted.
When memory takes over and corrects fact, makes it all tolerable.
When Agnes lies on her deathbed.
[Tobias] [scoffs] Do you know Agnes has such wonderful control?
I haven't seen her cry in... for the longest time. No matter what.
Warn me when she's coming and I'll act drunk.
Pretend you're very sick, Tobias, like you were with that stomach business.
But pretend your insides feel all green and stink and mixed up and your eyes hurt and you're half deaf.
And your brain keeps turning off.
And you have peripheral neuritis.
And you can hardly walk.
And you hate... you hate with the same stinking green sickness.
You think your bowels have turned into... yourself and everybody.
Hate.
But, oh, God, you want love.
L-0-V-E, so badly.
Comfort. It's-- Snuggling is what you really mean, of course.
But you hate.
And you notice with... a sort of detachment that amuses you, you think... that you're more of an animal every day.
You snarl.
You grab for things.
Hide them.
Can't remember where you've hid them, like not very bright dogs.
You wash less, prefer to be washed.
And, once or twice, you've even soiled your bed.
And you lie in it... because you can't move.
Pretend all that.
You don't like that, do you, Tobias?
I don't know why you want--
You want to know what it's like to be an alky, don't you, boy?
- Sure.
- Well, then you pretend all that.
So... the guy you're spending your bottles with
[sighs]
Starts you going to old AA.
And you sit there in the alky club listening to the better ones, not recovered.
'Cause once an alky, always.
You better remember that.
Or you're gone the first time you pass a saloon.
You watch the better ones get up and tell their stories.
Once you drop, you can come back up partway but never really back again.
Always descend.
[Claire] Well, that's life, baby.
You are a great damn fool.
But I am not an alcoholic!
Tam not now and I never wast!
[Tobias] All the promise, all the chance.
It would be so much simpler if I were... an alcoholic.
So, one night, one month sometime...
I'd had one martini.
It was a test to see if I could.
Which, given my... stunning self-discipline... had become three.
And I felt rather daring.
Nicely detached, a little bigger than life.
Not snarling yet.
And [ marched... more or less straight... straight to the front of the room, the hall... and faced my peers.
I looked them... all over... trying...
50 hard... grit and guilt failing.
Trying again and lost.
And [ had a moment's... sweeping... pity and disgust.
And I almost cried, but I didn't.
Like sister like sister, by God!
And I heard myself say in my little-girl voice-- there were a lot of different me's by then--
"I am a alcoholic.
My name is Claire, and I am a alcoholic.”
You try it.
My name is...
My name is Claire, and I am an alcoholic.
A alcoholic!
A alcoholic.
My name is Claire...
and I am a alcoholic.
Now, I am supposed to go on, you know, and tell them how bad I was and didn't want to be and how it happened and what I wanted to happen, and would they help me to help myself?
But I stood there... for ten seconds, maybe.
And then I curtsied.
I made my little-girl curtsy, and then, on my little-girl feet...
I padded back to my chair.
Did they... laugh at you?
An agnostic in the holy of holies doesn't get much camaraderie.
A little patronizing, maybe.
Oh, they were taken by the vaudeville, don't misunderstand me.
One lady was nice.
She came up to me later and she said,
"Well, you've taken the first step, dear.”
Well, that was nice of her.
Ah, but she didn't say the first step towards what.
Sanity? Insanity?
Revelation? Self-deception?
Change, sometimes, no matter what.
Count on you, Tobias.
Snappy phrase every time.
But it hooked me.
The applause, the stage presence.
That beginning.
No school tart had more gold stars for never missing class.
I went. Oh, God, I did.
-[Tobias] But stopped.
- Until I learned... being a slow student in my young old middle age... slowly, that I was not, nor ever had been, a alcoholic, or "an," either.
What I did not have in common with those people that they were sick... and I was merely willful.
[Agnes laughs]
-[Agnes] I've talked to Julia.
-[Tobias] Ah, how is she?
My, what an odd glass to put a soft drink in.
Tobias, you have a quiet sense of humor after all.
- Now, Agnes.
- He has not.
Well, it can't be brandy.
Tobias is a grown-up, not--
Ah, here's to you, sweet sister.
Not health, persistence.
In good, hard brandy, age inconnu.
Serve you right, my dear Tobias, if I were to go away, drift off.
You wouldn't have a woman left about you, only Claire and Julia, not even people.
Would serve you right.
But I'm not an alcoholic!
[Tobias] She can drink a little.
I will not tolerate it!
I will not have you-- Oh, God!
I wouldn't mind for a moment if you filled your bathtub with it, lowered yourself in it, and drowned.
I rather wish you would.
Give me the peace of mind to know you can do something well, thoroughly.
If you want to kill yourself, then do it right!
- Please, Agnes--
- What I can't stand is the selfishness.
Those of you who want to die and take your whole lives doing it.
Your wife is a perfectionist.
They're very difficult to live with, those people.
She is not an alcoholic.
She says she can drink some.
I'm not an alcoholic!
Well, we think that's very nice.
[laughs] We shall all rest easier to know that it is willful.
That the vomit and the tears, the muddy mind, the falls and the absences, the cigarettes out on the tabletops, the calls from the club to come and get you, please, that it is all willful.
If you are not an alcoholic, you are beyond forgiveness.
But I've been there for a long time, haven't I, sweetheart?
If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic, it is as simple as that.
- Who is to say?
-1l
[laughs] If we are to live on Tobias's charity, we are subject to the will of his wife.
If we were asked at our father's dying--
Those are the ground rules.
Tobias? Nothing?
Are those the ground rules? Nothing?
Too dried up? Too settled?
All right.
Very well, Agnes, you win.
I shall be an alcoholic.
And what are you gonna do about it?
Tobias?
You will be unhappy to know it,
I suppose, or... or have mixed emotions, certainly, but...
Julia is coming home.
-[Claire] Naturally.
-[Tobias] Yes?
She is leaving Doug, which is no surprise to me.
[Tobias] But wasn't Julia happy?
- You never told me--
- If Julia were happy, she would not be coming home.
I don't want her here, God knows.
-I mean, she's welcome, of course--
- Here we go.
Right on schedule, every three years.
This is her home.
We are her parents, the two of us.
We have our obligations to her.
And I have reached an age, Tobias, when I wish we were always alone, just you and [, without hangers-on or anyone.
Well, I'm not going.
But if she and Doug are through, and I'm not suggesting that she is in the right, then her place is properly here, as for some, it is not.
Mm-hmm, one, two, three, four, down they go.
- Well, I would like to talk to Doug.
-I wish you would.
If you had talked to Tom or Charlie--
- Yes, even Charlie, or--
- Phil.
Uh, Phil, might have done some good.
If you've decided to assert yourself finally, too late, I imagine.
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Julia might, at the very least, come to think her father cares.
And that might be a help, if not a consolation.
Well, Tl...
- I'll talk to Doug.
- Why don't you invite him here?
And while you're at it, why don't you bring all the others along.
You might talk to Julia, too.
You don't very much.
Yes.
Phillip loved to gamble,
Charlie loved the boys.
Tommy went for women, Douglas--
Will you stop that!
Ah, I am here after all.
I do exist!
Why don't you go off on a vacation,
Claire, now that Julia's coming home again.
Why don't you go to Kentucky or Tennessee and visit the distilleries.
Or why don't you lock yourself in your room or find yourself a bar with an apartment in the back.
Or, Agnes, why don't you die?
If I saw some point to it, some reason, chance, if I thought I might break through to her and say, "Julia."
But then what would I say?
"Julia," then nothing.
If we do not love someone... never have loved them.
No.
There can be silence, even having...
Do you really want me dead, Claire?
Wish, yes.
Wank? I don't know. Probably.
Although, I might regret it if I had it.
Remember the serpent's tooth, Tobias.
The cat that I had.
-[Claire] Huh?
- Hmm? .
The cat that I had when I was-- a year or so before I met you.
She was very old.
I'd had her since I was a kid.
She must have been 15 or more.
An alley cat.
She didn't like people very much,
I think.
When people came, she'd pick up and walk away.
She liked me,
or, rather, I could see that when I was alone with her she was content.
I don't know if she was happy, but she was content.
Yes?
And how the thing happened
I don't really know.
She-- One day, she...
One day, [ realized that she no longer liked me.
No, that's not right.
One day, I realized that she must have stopped liking me some time before.
And one evening...
Twas sitting alone, home...
and I was suddenly aware of her absence.
Not just that she wasn't in the room with me, but that she hadn't been in rooms with me, watching me shave, just about for...
And I couldn't place how long.
She hadn't gone away, you understand, or, rather, she had, but she hadn't run off.
I knew she was around.
I remember I'd caught sight of her from time to time, under a chair, moving out of a room.
And it was only when I realized something had happened that I could give any pattern to the things that had-- that I'd noticed.
She didn't like me anymore.
It was that simple.
But she was old.
[Tobias] No, it wasn't that.
She didn't like me anymore.
I tried to force myself on her.
Well, what, what, whatever do you mean?
[laughs]
Tobias) Well, I closed her in a room with me.
I'd pick her up.
I'd make her sit in my lap.
I would make her stay there when she didn't want to.
It didn't work.
She'd abide it, but she'd get down when she could.
Go away.
[Claire] Maybe she was ll.
No, she wasn't. I had her to the vet.
She didn't like me anymore.
And one night, I was fixed on it now.
I had her in the room with me sitting on my lap, for the what, the fifth time the same evening?
She lay there with her back to me, and she wouldn't purr.
And [ knew...
I knew that she was just waiting till she could get down, and I said to her, "Damn you, you like me!
Goddamn it, you stop this.
I haven't done anything to you."
And I shook her.
Thad my hands around her shoulders and I shook her.
And she bit me, hard.
And she hissed at me.
And so I hit her.
With my open hand,
I hit her smack right across the head.
I hated her.
[Agnes] Did you, did you, uh, hurt her badly?
Yes, well, no, not badly. She...
I must have hurt her ear some.
She shook her head for a day or so.
And, you see, there was no reason.
She and I had lived together, we'd been, well, you know, friends.
And there was no reason, and I hated her for that.
I hated her,
I suppose, because I was being accused of something.
Of failing.
I hadn't been cruel to her by design.
And if I'd neglected her, well, my whole life was...
And I resented it.
I resented having a... being judged.
Being betrayed.
What did you do?
Thad her Killed.
[Agnes] Well-- [stammers]
You had her put to sleep.
She was-- She was old.
You had her put to sleep.
Thad her Killed.
I took her to the vet.
And he took her... he took her in the back, and he gave her an injection, and he killed her.
Thad her Killed.
Well, what else could you have done?
There, there, there was nothing to be done.
I might have tried longer.
I might have gone on as long as cats live the same way.
I might have worn a hair shirt, locked myself in the house with her, done penance for something.
For what? God knows.
You probably did the right thing.
Distasteful alternatives.
The less ugly choice.
Was it?
[car approaching]
[engine stops]
Is that a car on the drive?
If we do not love someone... never have loved someone--
[Claire] Oh, stop that.
Love is not the problem.
You love Agnes, Agnes loves Julia,
Julia loves me, and I... love you.
We love each other.
We do. We all love each other.
- Yes.
- Yes.
To the depths of our... [sighs]
Self-pity and our greed.
What else but love?
[doorbell rings]
- Error?
- Hmm.
Quite possibly.
Love and error.
[Agnes] Edna! Harry!
What a surprise!
Why don't you take off your things.
Come in.
Tobias, it's, uh, it's Harry and Edna.
Harry and Edna.
- Why, Edna!
-[Edna] Hello, Tobias.
- Well, now.
- Harry.
- Hello, Edna.
- Hello there, Claire.
- Hello, Harry.
- Good evening, Claire.
We were just having a cordial.
Sit down.
Have you been out to the club?
I like this room.
To the club?
How are you, Harry?
Pretty well, Claire.
Not as good as I'd like, but--
Harry's been having his shortness of breath again.
I can't breathe sometimes for just a bit.
Well, two sets of tennis, you know.
[laughs]
What have you done to the room, Agnes?
Oh, the summer things are out.
Of course.
Have you been to the club?
I was talking to Edna about having our books done in leather bound.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, the question, unless I'm going deaf from all the alcohol, was have you all been to the club?
I'd wondered. [laughs]
- Why, no, no.
- Why, no--
But I thought, perhaps, you do drop by here on your way from there.
- No, no.
-[Agnes laughs]
Or, perhaps, that we were having a party and I'd lost a day.
[laughs] No. We were just sitting home.
- Agnes--
- Just sitting home.
Ha! Well...
[laughs] Well, glad you're here, party or not.
Good to see you, Tobias.
- How's Julia?
- Wrong question.
[chuckles] May I have some brandy, please, Tobias?
She's, uh, she's coming home, I'm afraid.
Oh, not again.
Just can't keep that one married, I guess.
- Oh, Agnes, what a shame.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Why'd you come, Harry?
Please, Claire.
We're glad you're here.
We're glad you came to surprise us.
Yes.
We were sitting home,
-just sitting home--
- We're glad to see you.
What happened, Harry?
Claire, please.
I don't see why people have to be questioned when they come for a friendly--
Harry wants to tell you, sis.
Harry?
We...
Well...
We were sitting home...
-[Tobias] Can I get you a drink, Harry?
-[stammers]
I, uh...
We thought of going to the club.
But it's so crowded on a Friday night--
With the canasta party and getting ready for the dance tomorrow.
We didn't want to do that, and I've been tired.
And...
- We didn't want to do that--
- Harry's been tired this whole week.
So we had dinner home and thought we'd stay--
- Rest.
- Of course.
[Claire] Shh, shh, shh.
Twill not shin.
Please?
[Tobias] Go on, Harry.
So we were sitting...
Edna was doing that panel she works on.
My needlepoint.
And I was reading my French.
I've got it pretty good now.
Not the accent, but the words.
And then?
Hmm?
[Claire] And then?
I don't know quite what happened then.
We were...
It was all very quiet.
- We were all alone, and then--
-[Edna sobs]
Nothing happened, but...
[sobbing]
Nothing at all happened, but...
[Edna cries] We got frightened.
[Harry] We got scared.
We were frightened!
There was nothing, but we were very scared.
We were terrified!
We were scared.
It was like being lost, very young again, with the dark, and lost.
[crying]
There was no thing to be frightened of, but...
We were frightened, and there was nothing.
We couldn't stay there.
So we came here.
You're our very best friends.
[crying] In the whole world.
Now, now, Edna--
We couldn't go anywhere else,
50 we came here,
Well, well, um, you did the right thing, of course.
[Tobias] Sure.
Uh, can I go to bed now? Please?
- Bed?
- We can't go back there.
Please?
Bed?
-[Harry] You're our...
-[Edna] I-I'm so tired.
...best friends in the world.
Tobias?
Of course we are, Harry.
Oh, oh, please.
Of, of course you can.
There's, uh... There's, uh, Julia's room.
Come with me, dear.
Tobias?
[Tobias] Edna.
Harry?
There was no one else we could go to.
[footsteps receding]
I was wondering when it would begin.
When it would start.
Start?
Start?
What?
You don't know yet?
You will.
[Julia] Do you think I like it? Do you?
[Agnes] Julia, please.
Do you? Do you think [ enjoy it?
[Agnes] Julia.
Think it gives me some sort of martyr's pleasure?
- Do you?
- Will you be still?
Well?
There is a house full of people.
Oh, yes, what about that?
I come home, my room is full of Harry and Edna.
I have no place to put my things.
They'll go into Tobias's room.
He'll sleep with me.
[scoffs] That'll be different.
What did you say, young lady?
I said, "That would be nice."
You did not say any such thing.
- You said--
- What are they doing here?
Don't they have a house anymore?
Has the market gone bust without my knowing it?
-I may have been out of touch, but--
-[Agnes] Just let it be.
Why are they here?
They are frightened.
Haven't you heard of it?
They're what?
They are frightened.
Now, will you let it be?
What are they frightened of?
Harry and Edna? Frightened?
I don't, I don't know yet.
Well, haven't you talked to them about it?
I mean, for God's sake!
No, I haven't.
What have they done all day?
Stayed up in their room, my room?
Not come down? Locked in?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
[laughs] Yes, they have stayed up in their room all day.
- My room.
- Your room.
Now, let it be.
. -No!
[Agnes] Please!
Oh, I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm sorry for screeching.
[laughs] I am too old, as I remember, to remember what it is like to be a daughter.
If my poor parents in their separate heavens will forgive me.
But I'm sure it's simpler than being a mother.
I said I was sorry.
I don't recall if I asked
Ty poor mother that.
I do wish, sometimes, that I'd been born a man.
- Not so odd.
- Their concerns are so simple.
Money and death.
Making ends meet until they meet the end.
[laughs] If they knew what it was like to be a wife, a mother, a lover, a homemaker, a nurse, a hostess, an agitator, a pacifier, a truth teller, a deceiver--
! Da-da-de, da-da-de }
-[Julia laughs]
- There's a book out, I believe.
Anew one.
By one of the 30 million psychiatrists now practicing in this land of ours.
A book which opines that the sexes are reversing.
Or coming to resemble each other too much, at any rate.
Simply read and disbelieved.
But it disturbs our sense of well-being, if the book is right. [laughs]
And I suspect it is.
Then I would be no better off as a man, would I?
No, not at all.
Oh, there is nowhere to rest the weary head.
Or whatever.
How are you, my darling?
What?
How are you, my darling?
How is your darling?
Well, Twas trying to tell you before you shut me up with Harry and Edna
-hiding upstairs.
- You're wrong!
I will try to tell you, Mother, once again, before you turned into a man.
I shall try to hear you out.
But if I feel my voice changing in the middle of your rant, you will have to forgive my male prerogative.
If I become uncomfortable, look at my watch, or jiggle the change--
Where do you think you're going?
You go straight to hell!
Now, now, what's going on here?
Will you shut her up?
- Well, I--
- There you are, Julia.
Your father can safely leave the room now,
I think.
Hello, my darling.
Your mother has arrived.
Talk to him.
Your daughter's in need of consolation or a great cuffing around the ears.
[laughs] I don't know which to recommend.
[Tobias] Have Harry and Edna...
No, they have not.
[Tobias] Well, I thought maybe...
Well, what was that all about?
As they say, I haven't the faintest.
- Oh.
- Evening papers?
- Yes, you want it?
- Anything happy?
My daughter's home?
Any other joys?
Sorry, no.
Small wars, large anxieties.
Our dear Republicans as dull as ever.
A teenage marijuana nest, not far from here.
I never had marijuana... in my entire life.
[Julia] Want some?
Wasn't fashionable.
[Julia] What the hell do Harry and Edna want?
Just let It be.
Didn't you talk to them today about it?
I mean...
No, they weren't down when I went off to the club.
- And--
- Good old golf.
Don't ride me, Julia. I warn you.
I've never had any marijuana either.
Aren't I a good old girl.
Either that or slow.
Great Christ!
What the hell did I come home to?
And why?
Both of you, snotty, mean--
Look!
There are some times when it all gathers up too much.
Sure, sure.
Some times when it's gonna be
Agnes and Tobias, not just Mother and Dad, right?
Some times when the allowances aren't gonna be made.
What are you doing?
Biting off your fingernails now?
It broke off,
There are some times when it's all too much.
I don't know what the hell Harry and Edna are doing sitting up in that bedroom.
Claire's drinking.
She and Agnes are at each other like a couple of, of...
- Sisters?
-[Tobias] What?
[Tobias] The goddamn government's at me over some deductions.
- And you...
- And me, yes?
This isn't the first time, you know?
The first time you've come back here with one of your goddamn marriages on the rocks.
Four! Count 'em!
I know how many marriages
I've gotten myself into!
Four!
You expect to come back here and nestle into being 15 and misunderstood each time.
You're 36-years old, for God's sake!
[Julia] And you are 100 easily!
Thirty-six, each time dragging your--
I was gonna say "pride"-- your marriage with you, like some Raggedy Ann doll, by the foot.
You, you fill this house with your whining--
I don't ask to come back here!
You belong here!
[laughs]
Well... now that I've taken out on my only daughter the disgust of my declining years,
I'll mix a very good and very strong martini.
-[door opens]
- Join me?
When I was a very little girl, well, when I was a little girl, after I'd gotten over my two year burn at suddenly having a brother, may his soul rest.
When I was still a little girl,
I thought you were a marvel.
Saint, sage, Daddy, everything.
And then, as the years turned
and I reached my somewhat angular adolescence--
Five to one, or more?
Then, as the years turned, poor old man, you sank to cipher.
And you've stayed there, I'm afraid.
Very nice, but ineffectual.
Essential, but not really thought of.
- Gray, non-eminence.
- Uh-huh.
And now you changed again.
Sea monster, ram, nasty, violent, absolutely human man.
As you make it, five to one, or better.
I made it about seven, I think.
Your transformation's amazed me.
How can I have changed so much?
Qr is it really you?
I told Agnes I'd talk to Doug.
If you think that would do any good.
By golly, Dad, that's a good martini.
You really want to talk to Doug?
You won't get anywhere.
The compulsives you can get somewhere with, or the illusion of getting.
The gamblers, the fags, the lechers--
- Of this world.
- Yes.
You can have the illusion because they're after something.
A jackpot somehow.
Break the bank, find the boy, climb the babe, something.
You do pick 'em.
Do?
[Tobias] Hmm?
Do I pick 'en?
Well, you may have been pushed on Charlie.
Yeah, poor old Charlie.
Oh, for Christ's sake, if you miss him so much...
I do not miss him!
Well, yes, I do, but not that way.
Because he seemed so, like... what Teddy would have been.
Your brother would not have grown up to be a fag.
Who's to say?
I.
[door opens]
- Do I breathe gin?
- Oh, darling!
- My sweet Claire.
- Oh, Julia.
Julia, oh!
I must say, the welcome-home committee was pretty skimpy, you and Daddy gone.
Now.
I said, "Do I breathe gin?"
You do.
Well, you don't look too bad for a quadruple amputee, I must say.
Are you gonna make me a whatever, Tobias?
Besides, my darling, it's getting to be rather a habit, isn't it?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Then... [ shall make my own.
[Tobias] Sit down, Claire. I'll do it.
Well, I wouldn't want to tax you now.
Well...
Thad an adventure today.
I went into town.
Thought I'd shake 'em up a little.
So I tried to find me
2 topless bathing suit.
You didn't!
- Yes, I did.
-[laughs]
I went into what's-the-name, straight up to the, uh, swimwear, as they call it, department.
Got me an 1890 school mistress type who wondered what she could do for me.
And [, uh, felt like telling her,
"Not much, sweetheart."
[Tobias] Are you sure you wouldn't rather have a...
Very.
But [ said, "Hello there.
I'm in the market for a topless swimsuit."
Really, Claire. [laughs]
[Claire] "I don't know what you mean," she said.
I said, "Oh, certainly you do.
No top, stops at the waist, the latest thing, lots of freedom.”
"Oh, yes," she said.
"I'm afraid we don't carry those."
"Well, in that case," I told her,
"Do you have any separates?”
"Ah, those we carry.”
Shall I bring it, or will you come for it?
You bring.
I said, "I said I'll buy the bottoms of one of those."
And, uh... she thought for a minute, and then she said, with ice in her voice,
"What shall we do with the tops?"
Well, now, "Well," I said,
"Why don't you save them?
Maybe bottomless swimsuits will be in next year."
[Julia laughs]
And the poor sweet thing gave me a look.
I couldn't tell.
It was either a D minus, or she was gonna send me home with a letter to my mother.
And, uh, she said, sort of far away...
"I think you need the manager.”
And off she walked.
What were you doing buying a bathing suit in October anyway?
- Oh, Dad--
- No, no, no, no, that's a man's question.
That's a good martini.
Truth will get you nowhere, Why?
Why?
Well, maybe I'll go on a trip somewhere.
That would please Agnes.
[laughs] As few things would.
No, what I meant was, maybe Toby will walk in one day, trailing travel folders, rip his tie off and announce he's fed up to there with the north, the east, the suburbs, the regulated, great gray dwindling life before him, and has bought him an island off Paraguay.
Which has no sea coast.
Yes. Way off.
Has bought him this island and is taking us all to that to hack through the whatever, build us an enormous lean-to, all of us.
Take us away.
To where it's always... good and happy.
Would you, Dad?
It's, uh... it's too late.
Or something.
Well, maybe I just simply wanted
2 topless bathing suit.
No?
Well, then maybe it's more complicated yet.
I mean, Claire couldn't find herself a man if she tried.
And here comes Julia, home from the wars.
- You could find a man.
- Oh, indeed, I have found several.
Briefly, and none my own.
Julia, don't you think Auntie Claire could find herself a man?
[clears throat]
I don't like the subject.
And here comes Julia, home from the wars, four purple hearts.
Why don't you just have another drink and stop it, Claire.
All right.
I have left Doug.
We are not divorced.
Yet.
You cooking another batch, Tobias?
But you've come back home, haven't you?
- Didn't you with the others?
- Where else am I supposed to go?
[chuckles] It's a great big world, baby.
Hotels, new cities.
Mm, home is the quickest road to Reno I know of.
You have such a lot of experience in these matters, Claire.
Sidelines, good seats, right on the 50-yard line.
Objective observers.
I swear, if I didn't love my sister so,
I'd say she got you hitched
-or the pleasure of getting you back.
- All right!
[Tobias] That will do now.
[Claire] Sorry.
They tell me in the kitchen, they tell me, we are about to dine in a bit.
Are we having a drink?
I think one might be nice.
It's one of those days when everything is underneath, but we are all together, which is something.
- Quite a few of us.
-[Tobias] Any news from up there?
[laughs] No, no.
I dropped upstairs.
Oh, that doesn't make much sense, does it?
I happened upstairs, and I knocked into Harry and Edna's, uh,
Julia's room door, and after a moment [ heard Harry say,
"It's all right. We're all right."”
Well, I didn't have the... [sighs]
[ Felt such an odd mixture of embarrassment and irritation, and apprehension, [ suppose, and fatigue.
-I didn't persevere.
- Well, haven't they been out?
I mean, haven't they eaten or anything?
[laughs] Make me a thing, will you?
A martini.
I am told-- They tell me that while we were all out on our various whatever they may be's,
Edna descended, asked them to make sandwiches, which were brought to the closed door and handed in.
Well, my God, I mean, like--
There is no point in pressing it.
There are very dear friends.
They will tell us in good time.
I had a glimmer of it last night, thought I knew.
That which we see in the bottom of the glass is most often dregs.
Really? Truly so?
Are we having our dividend, or are we not?
- All happy families are alike.
-[Harry] Well!
Well, look who's here!
[Tobias] Harry, just in time for a martini.
No, no, we're--
Well, Julia, there you are.
Oh, Julia.
There's enough time for 2 drink before dinner, if my husband will hurry some.
No. We're going home now.
Oh. Yes?
Uh, yes.
Well, if we were any help at all, I--
To get our things, our clothes and things.
-[Edna] Yes.
-[Harry] We'll be back in--
Well, after dinner, so don't...
Uh, an hour or two.
It'll take us a while.
We'll let ourselves out. Don't bother.
[door closes]
I want my room back.
I want my room.
I believe that dinner is served.
Yes.
If any of you have the stomach for it.
That was, without question, the ugliest dinner I've ever sat through.
What did you say?
Now, what can you mean?
Was the ragout not to your pleasure?
Did the floating island sink?
Watch what you say to your father.
He's proud of his wines.
No, you, sitting there like a combination pope and--
"We will not discuss it."
"Claire, be still."
"No, Tobias, the table is not the proper place.”
"Julia?"
Nanny! Like a nanny!
When we are dealing with children--
I must discover sometime who you think you are.
You will learn one day.
No, more like a drill sergeant.
You will do this, you will not do that.
To keep in shape.
Have you heard the expression?
Most people misunderstand it.
Assume it means alteration when it does not.
Maintenance.
When we keep something in shape, we maintain its shape, whether we are proud of that shape or not is another matter.
We keep it from falling apart.
We do not attempt the impossible.
We maintain, we hold.
I shall keep this family in shape.
I shall maintain it, hold it.
Yes, sir.
[Agnes] And if I shout, it is merely to be heard above the awful din of your privacies and shouts.
All of you.
I'm not being an ogre, am I?
[Tobias] No. No, very reasonable.
If I am a stickler on certain points, a martinet, as Julia would have it-- weren't you not sweet.
In fact, if I'm a stickler on points of manners, timing, tact, the graces are most blushed to call them, it is simply that I'm the one member of this reasonably happy family blessed and burdened with the ability to view a situation objectively while I am in it.
What time is it?
And if I must be the fulcrum...
I think I shall have a divorce.
A what? A what?
No fear. Merely testing.
Everything is taken for granted, and no one listens.
- Have 2 divorce.
- No, no.
Julia has them for all of us.
Not even separation.
That is taken care of, and, in life, the gradual demise of intensity.
The private preoccupations, the substitutions.
They become allegorical, my darling Tobias, as we grow older.
The individuality we hold so dearly sinks into crotchet.
We see ourselves repeated by those we bring into it all, either by meddle or rejection, honor or fault.
I'm not a fool.
I'm really not.
[Julia] What's Claire up to?
Really not at all.
[Tobias] No, really not.
Well, how would I know what she's up to?
Well, you are the fulcrum and all around here.
The double vision, the great balancing act.
I daresay... she's in her room.
At least she has one.
Why don't you run upstairs and claim your goddamn room back!
Barricade yourself in there, push your bureau in front of the door.
Take Tobias's pistol while you're at It.
Arm yourself.
[accordion music]
Barricades? Pistols? Really? So soon?
Claire, will you take off that damn thing.
They laughed when I sat down to the accordion.
Take it off? No, will not.
This is gonna be a festive night, by the smell of it, and Sister Claire wants to do her part.
Pay her way, so to speak, justify.
[Agnes] You're not gonna play that dreadful instrument in here.
[lively tune]
- Tobias, do something about that.
- Calm down, Agnes.
Ma used to say, "Claire girl." [chuckles]
She had an uncle named Claire, so she always used to call me Claire girl.
[laughs]
[Agnes] That is not so.
"Claire girl," she used to say,
"When you go out into the world, get dumped out of the nest, or pushed out by your sister."
Lies.
Even in her teens, your Auntie Claire had her own and very special ways.
Was very advanced.
[Claire] Thad a ball, same as you.
You know, your mommy got her pudenda scuffed a couple of times herself
'fore she met ol' Toby there, you know?
Only [ wasn't puce with socially proper remorse every time.
Your what?
My pudenda.
You can come on all forgetful in your old age, if you want to, but just remember--
I'm not an old woman.
Am I?
[Tobias laughs]
Well, you're my old lady.
[Claire] What'll it be?
[lively accordion music]
Save it for Harry and Edna.
Save it for Harry and Edna?
Save it for them?
-[accordion music]
- Please.
[accordion squeaks]
All right.
I'll unload.
We're waiting, aren't we?
Huh?
Waiting.
The room, the doctor's office.
The beautiful unconcern, the intensive study of the dreadful curtains, the absorption in Field & Stream.
Waiting for the biopsy.
No?
Don't know what [ mean?
- What about Harry and Edna?
- We don't want to talk about it.
- If they come back--
- If?
If they come back, we will.
You only have two choices, Sis.
Take them in or throw 'em out.
Ah, how simple it is from the sidelines.
We'll do neither, I imagine.
Take in, throw out.
Oh?
Well, yes, they're just...
-passing through.
-[Claire laughs]
-[car approaching]
- As they have been all these years.
Well, we shall know soon enough.
- They're back.
-[Tobias] Yes?
[Julia] I think I'll go up.
“You'll stay right here--
-I want to go to my room.
It is their room for the moment.
Among Doug's opinions, you might like to know, is that when you and your ilk are blown to pieces by a Chinese bomb,
the world will be 2 better place!
Isn't "ilk" a lovely word?
Oh, come on now.
Well, it'll be a less crowded one.
You choose well, Julia.
Well, that's what he says.
Have always.
Did he include you as ilk as well?
Will you be with us when the fatal mushroom comes, as those dirty boys put it?
Are we to have the pleasure?
- I'll be right here.
- Agnes.
Would you like to know something else he says?
- No, Julia.
- Daddy?
Not right this minute, Julia.
Claire, you?
Oh, come on, you know
I'd like to hear about it, I'd love to, but Toby and Ag have got an invasion on their hands.
We have no such thing.
And maybe you'd better wait for Harry and Edna, too.
It does not concern Harry and Edna.
Best friends.
Tobias?
- Where, what will [ do with everything--
- Ch, for God's sake, I'll do it.
Oh.
What?
What do they want, Harry and Edna?
-[Claire] Hmm?
- You'll make Mother mad.
Harry and Edna, what do they want?
- Succor.,
- Pardon?
Comfort.
Warmth.
A special room with a night-light.
Or the door ajar so they can look down the hall from the bed and see that Mummy has her door open.
That's my room.
It's their room.
Happens you were in it.
You're a visitor as much as anyone now.
But I know that room.
You home for good now?
You home forever?
Back from the world to the sadness and reassurance of your parents.
You come to take my place?
This is my home.
We are not the communal nation, dear.
Mm, giving, but not sharing.
Outgoing, but not friendly.
Hello.
Hello.
We submerge our truths and have our sunsets on untroubled waters.
Come on in, Edna.
Yes.
[Claire] Do you think we can walk on the water, Edna, or do you think we sink?
[Edna] We sink.
And we better develop gills, right?
Right.
I didn't see you come in.
Oh, we drove around the back.
Harry's helping Agnes and Tobias get our bags upstairs.
Don't you mean that Agnes and Tobias are helping Harry?
If you like.
What were you two up to?
[Claire] I think
Julia's home for good this time.
I say, Claire.
[Edna] Oh? Is it come to that?
[Claire] I always said she would finally.
It's family business.
[Edna] Yes, but I don't think that Agnes and Tobias have seen it as clearly.
I do wish Agnes would have those chairs re-covered.
Perhaps now that--
Why don't you call the upholsterers, now that you're living here!
[Claire] All in the family.
You're not a child anymore, Julia.
You're nicely on your way to 40.
And you've not helped wedlock's image any with your shenanigans.
You are a guest in this house!
And if you have decided to return forever, then it's a matter of some concern for quite a few people--
You are a guest!
[Claire] As you.
For quite a few people whose lives are... moved, if not necessarily touched, by your actions.
Claire, where does Agnes have her upholstery done?
- Does she use--
- No!
Manners, young lady.
Julia, why don't you ask Edna if she'd like something?
No!
You have no right here.
I'll have a cognac, Julia.
My husband and I are your parents' best friends.
We are, in addition, your godparents.
- Does this give you rights?
- Some.
Some. Rights and responsibilities.
- Some.
-[footsteps approaching]
Hello, Harry. Come on in.
Julia's about to fix us something.
What would you like?
Tl do it.
Don't trouble yourself, Julia.
No! No, don't you come near it!
Don't you take a step!
[Julia pants, whimpers]
- Julia.
- No!
Let her do it, Harry. She wants to.
I don't want to!
Then I'll do it, Julia.
- Mother? Mother!
- Oh, honestly.
Mother!
- Julia?
-[Julia moans]
Will you let me do it?
May I get the drinks?
Stay away from it.
All of you!
Now, Julia.
-[Julia] Mother?
- Oh, come on.
- Now, Julia.
-[Julia moans]
[Edna] Let her go, Harry.
Mother! Father! Help me!
- Julia, you're shouting!
-[Julia] Help me!
[Julia] M-Mother.
What is it, dear?
- They, they want--
- Forget it, Julia.
Yes, for God's sake, forget it.
- They want.
- Perhaps you had better come upstairs.
[Julia] Yes, where? What room?
Come up to my room. Lie down.
Your room?
No, you can lie down in our room if you prefer.
Your room? Your room! Mine! Mine!
- God!
- Don't you go near that!
- Julia!
-[Julia] I want.
[Edna] What do you want, Julia?
-[Harry] Jesus.
-[Julia] I want what is mine!
Well, then, my dear, you'll have to decide what that is, will you not?
Daddy? Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
- Daddy?
-[door slams]
I do believe that's the first time she's called on her father in... since her childhood.
- When she used to skin her knees.
- Yes.
And she would come home bloody.
I assumed she was clumsy, but...
it crossed my mind 3 time or two that she was religious.
Praying on the gravel? A penance?
Yes.
Teddy had just died, I think.
And it was an unreal time for a number of us.
For me.
Poor little boy.
-[Edna] Yes.
-[log clatters]
It was an unreal time.
I thought Tobias was out of love with me.
Or, rather, was tired of it when Teddy died, as if it had been the string.
[Harry] Would you like something, Edna?
[Edna] Mm-hmm.
Things I doubted then, that I was loved, that I loved, for that matter...
Teddy had ever lived at all.
My mind, you see.
That Julia wouldn't be with us long.
I think...
I think I thought Tobias was unfaithful to me then.
- Was he, Harry?
-[Edna] Oh, Agnes.
Come on, Agnes. Of course not. No!
Was he, Claire?
That hot summer, with Julia's knees all bloody?
And Teddy dead.
Did my husband cheat on me?
You got me, Sis.
[chuckles]
And that will have to do.
- Poor Julia.
- Julia's a fool.
Make me a drink, will ya, Harry?
Since you're being Tobias. A scotch.
[Harry] Sure thing. Claire?
Why not?
Claire could tell us so much if she cared to, could you not, Claire?
Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much.
Has seen us all so clearly, have you not, Claire?
- You were not named for nothing.
- Lay off, Sis.
What do you want?
I don't know what you mean.
- What do you really want?
-[Claire] You gonna tell her, Harry?
I don't know what you mean, Claire.
Scotch, was it, Agnes?
-{Agnes) I said--
“Yes, but I don't remember.
Don't talk to Harry like that.
I...
I-I'm so-sorry, Edna.
I forgot that, um, you're very frightened people.
- Don't you make fun of us!
- My dear Edna!
- I'm not making--
- Yes, you are!
You are making fun of us!
-I assure you, Edna--
- Here's your drink.
I-I assure you!
Well, I think it's time for a little music, don't you, kids?
We don't want music, Claire.
I yodel a little, too, nowadays,
-if anybody--
- You yodel?
Yes!
-[Claire yodels]
-[Harry] She yodels.
What would you like, Harry?
A chorus of "take me to the greenhouse and lay me down"?
-[Agnes] Claire.
-I wonder if, before the concert, one of you wouldn't mind telling me why on earth my daughter is upstairs in hysterics?
Envy, baby! She don't sing or nothin'.
[yodels]
-[Tobias] Please!
-[Agnes] What was she--
Now, will any of you tell me why?
-[Agnes] What's she doing?
-I told you. She's in hysterics.
That is a condition.
L inquired about an action.
-{Edna) Poor Julia.
-I don't understand that girl.
An action? Is that what you want? Okay.
How about pressed against the corner of the upstairs hall.
Arms wide, palms back, eyes darting wide.
How about tearing into Harry and Edna's room, ripping the clothes from closets, hangers and all on the floor.
The same for the bureaus.
-[Agnes] I see.
- More?
[Agnes] All right.
Went into your room next.
Twisted on the bed, lots of breathing, the great wide eyes.
The spread gathered under her, your big lace pillow in her arms like a lover.
Eyes wide open, no tears now.
Though if you go near the...
Sounds start, and you think she'll scream if you touch her.
- How's that?
-[Claire] Pretty good.
[Agnes] And accurate, I imagine.
You're damn right! Now, why?
I was making myself a drink, for God's sake.
I asked her to make me something.
[Tobias] Come on now!
That sounds incomplete to you, Toby?
Somewhat.
[Agnes] Julia has been through a trying time, Tobias.
- Suppose we did upset her some.
-[Edna] Of course.
Don't you think you should go tend to her?
No.
She will be down, or she will not.
She will stop, or she will go on.
[Tobias] Oh, for God's sake, Agnes.
I haven't the time, Tobias.
I haven't time for the four-hour talk, the soothing recapitulation.
You don't go through it, my love, the history.
Nothing is calmed by a pat on the hand, a gentle massage, or slowly, slowly combing the hair.
The history, Teddy's birth, and how she felt unwanted, tricked.
His death, and was she more relieved than lost.
All the schools we sent her to, and did she fail in them through hate or love?
And when we come to marriage, dear, each one of them, the fear, the happiness, the sex, the stopping, the infidelities--
- All right, Agnes--
- The comings-home, the new resolves, departures. [laughs]
Oh, my dear, Tobias, my life has gone through more than hers.
I see myself growing old each time, my own life passing.
No, I haven't time for it now.
At midnight, maybe, when you're all in your beds, safely sleeping.
Then I shall comfort our Julia and lose myself once more.
I tell you, there are so many martyrdoms here.
[Agnes] No, one to a person.
That is the usual.
Though I do believe there are some with none, and others who have known Job.
The hopeless are the cruelest lot of all.
They shift their burdens so.
You interviewed a camel, he'd admit he loved his load.
I wish you two would stop having at each other.
Hell yes, let's have a drink.
- Tobias?
- Huh?
[Harry) What can I make you, buddy?
[Claire] Dear, you've actually spoken your mind!
What can you make me?
I do, sometimes.
Sure, I'm here.
When an environment is not all that it might be.
Oh, uh, yeah, scotch.
Is that for you to say?
[Claire] Here we come.
Stop it, Claire, dear. I said... is that for you to say?
Oh, we must be helpful when we can, my dear.
That is the responsibility, the double demand of friendship, is it not?
But... when we are asked.
No.
Not only.
It seemed to me, well, to us, that since we are living here...
Living?
Living here?
Living here?
- That's my cue!
-[lively tune]
[Julia] Get them out of here, Daddy!
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!
- Get them out of here!
-[accordion squeals]
Julia!
Get them out of here, Daddy.
All right.
Julia, baby.
[Julia cries]
Let's, let's have it now.
Get, get, get them out of here, Daddy.
[Julia whimpers]
Come on now.
Get them out of here, Daddy.
[Agnes] You ought to be horsewhipped, young lady.
- All right now.
- Do it, Daddy.
Or give it back.
[Agnes] How dare you come into this room like that.
How dare you embarrass me and your father.
How dare you frighten--
- Are you going?
-[Tobias] Julia, please.
[Julia] Are you?
Going?
No, we are not going.
[Harry] No.
-[Julia] You see--
- Coming down here with a gun like that.
You return to your nest from your latest disaster, dispossessed, and suddenly dispossessing.
[crying]
You scream the house down, claw at all of us.
- Stop her!
- Willful, wicked, wretched girl!
You are not-- You have no rights!
We have rights here. We belong.
- Mother.
- We belong here, do we not?
Forever? Have you come to stay forever?
-[yelps]
- If need be!
Sorry. A godmother's duty.
If we come to the point, if we are at home one evening, and the... terror comes, descends, if all at once we... need... we come where we are wanted, where we know we are expected, not only where we want.
We come where the table has been laid for us in such an event, where the bed is turned down and warmed and has been ready should we need it.
We are not... transients, like some.
[Julia] No.
You have come to live with us, then?
Why, yes.
We have.
Well, then... perhaps it is time for bed.
- Julia?
- Mother?
Come upstairs with me.
Let me... comb your hair... rub your back... and we shall soothe and salve and fall to sleep.
Tobias?
Well, I think it's time for bed.
[Tobias] Well, yes, yes, of course.
We know the way.
Friendship is something like a marriage, is it not, Tobias?
For better and for worse?
Sure.
We haven't come to the wrong place, have we?
Have we, Toby?
No. No, of course you haven't.
Good night, dear Tobias.
- Good night, Claire.
- Night, you two.
- Good night, old man.
- Good-- Good night, you two.
[footsteps receding]
Full house, Tobias.
Every bed, every cupboard.
Good night, Claire.
You gonna stay up, Tobias?
A sort of night watch, guarding?
I've done it.
The breathing as you stand in the quiet hall, slow and heavy.
The special warmth and permeation of a house asleep.
When the house is sleeping.
When the people are asleep.
Good night, Claire.
And the difference... the different breathing in the cold when every bed is awake all night.
Very still, eyes open, staring into the dark.
You know that one?
Good night, Claire.
Good night, Tobias.
[door opens]
[door closes]
Ah, there you are.
7:30 am. All is well.
I guess.
[Agnes] So odd.
Hmm?
There was a stranger in my room last night.
- Who?
- You.
Ah.
It was nice to have you there.
Hmm?
[chuckles]
Les temps perdu.
I've never understood that.
Perdu means lost, not merely passed.
But it was nice to have you there.
Though I remember when it was a constancy.
How easily I would fall asleep, pace my breathing to your breathing.
[sighs] And... if we were touching, oh, what a splendid cocoon that was.
But last night... what a shame, what sadness.
You were a stranger.
And I stayed awake.
- I'm sorry.
- Were you asleep at all?
No.
I would go half, then wake.
Your...
Your unfamiliar presence, sir.
I could get used to it again.
- Yes?
- I think.
Didn't have your talk with Julia.
- No.
- Your all-night lulling.
No, no, she wouldn't let me stay.
"Look to your own house,” is what she said.
You stayed down long?
- When?
- After. Before you came to bed.
Some.
Almost went to my room by habit.
By mistake, rather.
And then I realized that your room
Was my room, because my room is Julia's, because Julia's room is--
Yes.
And, uh, I was awake when you left my room again.
You could have said.
I felt shy.
- Hmm?
- Did you go to Claire?
I never go to Claire.
Did you go to Claire to talk?
I never go to Claire.
We must always envy someone we should not.
Be jealous of those who have so much less.
You and Claire make so much sense together, talk so well.
I never go to Claire at night or talk with her alone save publicly.
[laughs] In public rooms, like this.
[Tobias] Yes.
Have never?
Please?
I shall start missing you when you move from my room again.
If you do.
Thad stopped, I believe.
[scoffs] Oh, you're an honest woman.
Oh, well. We need one in every house.
It's very strange to be downstairs in a room where everyone has been and is gone, very late, after the heat is gone.
The furnace and the bodies.
The hour or so before the sun comes up, the furnace starts again.
It's rather godlike, if I may presume, to look at it all reconstruct with such detachment.
See yourself, you, Julia, look at it all, play it out again.
Watch.
Judge.
No, that's being in it. Watch.
And if you have a drink or two...
[Agnes] Did you?
Mm-hmm. And if you have a drink or two, very late, in the quiet, tired, the... mind lets loose.
[Agnes] Mm?
And you watch it as it reasons.
And all with a kind of grateful delight, and at the same time sadly,
"cause you know that when the daylight comes, the pressures will be on.
And all the insights won't be worth a damn.
[Agnes laughs]
And what did you decide?
You can sit and watch, you can have so clear a picture, see everyone moving through his own jungle, and insight into all the reasons, all the needs.
Good. And what did you decide?
Why is the room so dirty?
Can't we have better servants?
Some help who help?
They keep far better hours than we, that's all.
They're a comment on our habits.
A reminder that we are out of step.
That is why we pay them
So very, very much.
Neither a servant nor a master be, remember?
I remember when--
When you were very young and lived at home, and the servants were awake whenever you were.
Six a.m. for your breakfast when you wanted it, five in the morning when you came home drunk and 17.
[chuckles] Washing the vomit from the car, and you telling no one.
Stealing just enough each month by arrangement with the stores to keep them in a decent wage.
Generations of them, all just blind and always dying.
The cook, who did a better dinner drunk than sober.
Those servants.
Those days when you were young and lived at home.
Mm. [chuckles]
Well, my darling, you are not young now, and you do not live at home.
Where do I live?
In the dark sadness. Yes?
What are we gonna do?
What did you decide?
- Nothing.
- Well, you must.
Your house is not in order, sir.
It's full to bursting.
Yes. You've gotta help me here.
No, I don't think so.
- No?
I thought a little last night, too, while you were seeing everything so clearly here.
I lay in the dark and I revisited our life.
The years and years.
There are many things a woman does.
She bears the children, if there is that blessing.
Blessing? Yes, I suppose.
Even with the sadness.
She runs the house, for what that's worth.
Makes sure there's food, and not just anything, and decent linen.
Looks well.
Assumes whatever duties are demanded if she's in love or loves.
And plans.
I know, I know.
But there are things we do not do.
- Yes?
- Yes.
We don't decide the route.
- You are copping out, as they say.
- No, indeed.
- Yes, you are!
-[Agnes] Don't you yell at me.
- You're copping out.
- We follow.
We let our men decide the moral issues.
Never!
You've never done that in your life.
Always, my darling.
Whatever you decide, I'll make it work.
I'll run it for you.
So you'll never know there's been a change in anything.
[Tobias] No, no.
So, let me know.
I know I'm tired.
I know I've hardly slept at all.
I know I've sat down here and thought.
And made your decisions?
But I have not judged. I told you that.
Well, when you have, you let me know.
No!
- You'll wake the house.
- I'll wake the house!
This is not the time for you to lose control.
I'll lose control!
I've sat down here in the cold, in the empty cold,
I've sat here alone.
I've looked at everything, all of it.
I thought of you, Julia, and Claire.
- And Edna and Harry?
- Well, of course. What do you think?
I don't know, I'm listening.
Morning.
I don't suppose, uh...
Shall [ make some coffee?
Why don't you do that, darling.
Morning, Julie.
Sorry about last night, Daddy.
Oh, well, now.
I mean,
I'm sorry for having embarrassed you.
[Agnes] Coffee.
Aren't you sorry for embarrassing me, too?
Well, isn't it nice that Julia's making coffee?
No? If they help her out?
Isn't it nice to have a daughter who can put a pot to boil?
"Aren't you sorry for embarrassing me, too?"
You have a problem there with Julia.
I? I have a problem?
But at least you have your women round you, crowded round full of warm support.
That must be a comfort to you.
Most explorers go alone, don't have their families with them.
Pitching tents, tending the fire, shooing off the antelopes or the bears or whatever.
"Aren't you sorry for embarrassing me, too?"
- Are you quoting?
- Yes.
Next, we'll have my younger sister with us.
Another porter for the dreadful trip.
Claire's never missed a chance to participate in watching.
She'll be here, we'll have us all.
You'll all sit down and watch me carefully, smoke your pipes and stir the cauldron.
- Watch.
-[laughs] Yes.
You who make all the decisions, who really rule the game.
That's an illusion you have.
You'll all sit here, too early for anything, on this stupid Sunday, all of you, and dare me when it's just as much your choice as mine.
Each time that Julia comes, each clockwork time, do you send her back, do you tell her,
"Julia, go home to your husband.
Try it again.”
Do you? No.
You'll let it slip.
- It's your decision, sir.
-It is not. I--
And I must live with it, resign myself.
One marriage more and wait and hope that Julia's motherhood will come one day, one marriage.
I'm almost too old to be a grandmother.
As I'd hoped, too young to be one.
Oh, I'd wanted that.
The youngest older woman on the block.
Julia's almost too old to have a child properly, will be, if she ever does.
If she marries again.
You, you could have pushed her back if you'd wanted to.
It's very early yet.
That must be it.
-I have never heard such--
- Or Teddy.
No?
No stammering here.
- You'll let this pass.
- Please.
When Teddy died... we could have had another son.
We could have tried.
But no.
Those months--
- Or was it a year?
- No more of this.
I think it was a year when you spilled yourself on my belly.
I said, "Please, please, Tobias."
But no. You wouldn't even say it out.
"I don't wank another child, another loss."
"Please, please, Tobias."
And guiding you, trying to hold you in.
Agnes, please.
"Don't leave me then like that, not again.
Tobias, please. I can take care of it.
We won't have another child, but, please, don't leave me like that."
Such... silent, sad... disgusted love.
I-I-I didn't wank you to have to...
Sir?
-I didn't want you to have to, you know.
-Oh, that was thoughtful of you.
Like a pair of adolescents in a rented room, in the family car.
- Doubtless you hated it as much as L.
- Yes.
- But wouldn't let me help you.
- No.
Which is why you took to your own sweet room instead.
Yes.
The theory being pat that half a loaf is worse than none.
That you are racked with guilt, stupidly, and I must suffer for it.
Yes.
Well, it was your decision, was it not?
Yes.
And I have made the best of it.
Have lived with It.
Have I not?
What are we going to do about everything?
Whatever you like. Naturally.
[Claire] Morning, kids.
All I can do is run it for you in full cast.
[Tobias] Morning, Claire.
[Agnes] Julia's in the kitchen.
Making coffee, Claire.
Which means, I guess,
I go watch Julia grind the beans and drip the water.
I tell you, she's a real pioneer, that girl.
Coffee pot in one hand and pistol in t'other.
Claire's a comfort in the early morn,
I've been told.
-[Tobias] Yes.
- That is what I've been told.
Shall I ask them to leave?
- Who?
- Harry and Edna.
[laughs]
For a moment,
I- thought you meant Julia and Claire.
No, Harry and Edna.
Shall I throw them out?
Harry is your very best friend and an old--
Yes, and Edna is yours. Well?
You'll have to live with it either way.
Do or don't.
Well, then, why don't I throw Julia and Claire out?
Why don't I throw the whole bunch out?
[laughs] Or get rid of me.
That would be easier.
Rid yourself of the harridan.
Then you can run your mission, take out sainthood papers.
I think you're stating an opinion, a preference.
But if you do get rid of me... you'll no longer have your life the way you want it.
But that's not my-- that's not all the choice I've got, is it?
Well, I don't, I don't care very much what choice you've got, my darling.
But...
Tam concerned with what choice you make.
[Julia] Ready!
Ah.
[Agnes] Ah, here are the helpmates.
What would we do without them?
The coffee's instant, I'm afraid.
Couldn't find a bean.
Help must lock them up before they go to bed.
Pop?
Let's clear away some of the debris, huh?
Pop?
[Agnes] It's true!
We cannot drink our coffee amidst the sea of last night's glasses.
Tobias, do be a help.
I didn't have to do a thing.
Thank God for pre-squeezed orange juice.
There, that's much better, isn't it?
[Tobias] Whatever you say, Julie.
Now, I'll play waiter. Sis?
Uh, thank you, Claire.
Little Julie?
Just put it down beside me, Claire.
I'm pouring, you can see.
- Pop?
- Thank you, Claire.
Well, yours is here, daughter, when you've done with playing early-morning hostess.
Thank you, Claire.
Now, one for little Claire.
Why don't you have some vodka in it,
Claire, to start the Sunday off?
Now, all of you! Sit down. Shut up!
I want to talk to you.
- Did I give you sugar, Mama?
-[Tobias] Be quiet, Julia!
- My darling, yes--
-[Tobias] I want to talk to you.
Well, go on, Tobias.
You too, Claire, please.
Now.
Now, something happened here last night.
And I don't mean Julia's hysterics with the gun--
-[Julia] If you were--
- Be quiet, Julia.
[Tobias] Although [ do mean that in part.
I mean, Harry and Edna coming here.
- Hmm.
- Yes, do you want to say something, Julia?
No?
I came down here...
and I sat all night, hours.
And I did something rather rare for this family.
I thought about something.
I'm sorry, Tobias, but that's not fair.
I thought.
I sat down here and thought about all of us and everything.
Now, Harry and Edna have come to us and asked for help.
- That is not true.
- Be quiet, Julia.
That is not true!
They have not asked for anything.
Please, Julia.
They have told.
They've come in here and ordered.
Just like the family.
Asked.
If you're begging and you've got your pride.
If you're begging, then you may not have your pride.
I don't think that's true, Julia.
Oh, Julia wouldn't know. Ask me.
Those people have no right!
[Tobias] No right? All these years?
We've known them ever since--
For God's sake, Julia, these people are our friends!
Then take them in.
Take these intruders in.
Look, baby, didn't you get the message on rights last night?
Didn't you learn about intrusion, what the score is, who belongs?
You bring those people in here, Father, and I'm leaving.
[Tobias] Yes?
I don't mean coming and going, Father.
I mean as family.
Harry and Edna are our friends.
They are intruders!
Crisis. Sure brings out the best in us, eh, Tobe?
Family circle.
Julia standing there, asserting, perpetual brat!
Maybe ready to pull a Claire.
And poor Claire.
Not much help there, either.
And look at Agnes, talky Agnes, ruler of the roost, maitre d', and licensed wife.
Silent.
All cozy, coffee.
Thinking of the menu for the week.
Planning.
Poor Tobe.
I was merely waiting until I'd heard and thought a little, listened to the rest of you.
I thought someone should sit back, especially me.
Ruler of the roost, licensed wife, midnight nurse.
And I've been thinking about Harry and Edna.
About disease.
About what?
- About disease.
- Oh, for God's sake.
About disease, or, if you like, the terror.
Terror?
Yes. The terror or the plague.
They're both the same.
Let me tell you something about disease.
Mortal illness.
You either are immune to it or you fight it.
Ten centuries ago, and even less, the treatment was quite simple.
Burn them.
Burn their bodies, burn their houses, burn their clothes, and move to another town... if you were enlightened.
But now, with modern medicine, we, we merely isolate, we quarantine, we ostracize if we are not immune ourselves, unless we are saints.
So your midnight vigil, darling, your reasoning in the cold, pure hours have been over the patient and not the disease.
It is not--
Edna and Harry, who have come to us, dear friends, it is a disease.
Oh, for God's sake, Agnes, it is our friends.
What am [ supposed to do?
Say, "Look, you can't stay here, you two.
You've got trouble.
You're friends and all, but you come in here clean.”
Well, I can't do that, no.
Agnes, for God's sake, if that is all Harry and Edna have meant to us, then what about us?
When we talk to each other, what have we meant? Anything?
When we touch, when we promise, or say yes, or please... with ourselves... have we meant, "Yes, but only if"?
If there's any condition, Agnes, then... it's all been empty.
Perhaps.
But blood binds us.
Blood holds us together when we've no more deep affection for ourselves than others.
I'm not asking you to choose between your family and our friends.
[Tobias] Yes, you are.
Tam merely saying that there is disease here.
And Task you, who in this family is immune?
I am, I've had it, and I'm still alive, I think.
Claire is the strongest of us all.
The walking wounded, off and on, the least susceptible.
But think about the rest of us.
Are we immune to it?
The plague, my darling, the terror sitting in the room upstairs.
Well, if we are, then on with it.
And if we are not, well, why not be infected?
Why not die of it?
We're bound to die of something soon, or in a while, or... shall we burn them out?
Rid ourselves of it all and wait for the next invasion.
You decide, my darling.
- Good morning.
-[Agnes] Ah!
- You're up.
-[Claire] Good morning, Edna. Harry.
Harry would like to talk to Tobias.
I think they should be alone, perhaps.
Of course. Uh, um...
Why don't we go in the kitchen, make a proper breakfast.
No, you don't need to.
Yes, yes, we want you to have your talk.
- Tobias?
-[Tobias] Uh, yes.
We'll be nearby.
Uh, did you sleep well, Edna?
Did you sleep at all? [snorts]
I've never had that bed, but I know that when--
-[door slams]
- Well, look at them go.
They got out of here quick enough.
You'd think there was a...
Morning, Tobias.
-[Tobias] Morning, Harry.
- Know what I'd like to do?
Something I've never done before in my life,
except once when I was about 24.
[Tobias] No, what?
Have a drink before breakfast.
- Is it all right?
-[Tobias] Sure.
-[door closes]
- Will you join me?
Tobias) I guess so, yes.
There isn't any ice.
Well, uh, then just whiskey, neat.
- Uh, brandy.
- Oh, God, no. [laughs]
- Whiskey, then.
- Yes, thank you.
- Well, here's to youth again.
- Yep.
Doesn't taste too bad in the morning, does it?
No, but I've,
I've had some before.
When?
Earlier. Oh, 3:00 or 4:00, while you all were asleep, or whatever you were doing.
Hmm, you were awake, huh?
- Yes.
-I slept a little.
- God.
- What?
You know what I did last night?
No.
I got out of bed, and I crawled in with Edna.
Yes.
She held me, let me stay a while.
Then I could see she wanted to, and I didn't, so... [ went back.
[laughs] It was funny.
Yeah.
Do, uh... you, uh... like Edna, Tobias?
Why, sure, I like her, Harry.
Now, Tobias.
About last night... and yesterday and our coming here.
- I was talking to Edna about it,
-I sat down here and thought about that.
I said-- Sorry.
I said I sat down here and thought about it, and I talked to Agnes, too, before you all came down, and...
God, [ don't know, Harry.
We can make it if you want us to.
I can. I mean, I think I can.
No, we're...
We're going, Tobias.
I don't know what help.
I don't know how--
-I said we're going.
- Yes, but...
- You-You're going?
- Sure,
But, but...
You can try it here. Or we can.
No, Harry, you can't go back there.
You've got to--
Got to what? Sell the house?
Buy another? Move to the club?
You came here.
Do you want us here, Tobias?
You came here.
Do you want us here?
You came here.
Do you want us here?
Edna and I...
Oh, there's so much over the dam.
So many disappointments, evasions.
[ guess lies, maybe.
So much we remember we wanted once.
So little that we've settled for.
We talk. Sometimes, mostly no.
We don't like. Sure, we like, but...
I've always been a little... shy, gruff.
You know, shy.
Um...
Edna isn't happy. I suppose that's it.
We like you... a-and Agnes.
Well, and Claire and Julia, too, but...
Oh.
I guess I mean...
I like you, and you like me, I think.
And you're our best friends.
But I told Edna upstairs, I said...
"Edna... what if they had come to us?"
And she didn't say anything.
And I said, "Edna... if they had come to us like this... and even though we don't have Julia and all that...
Edna...
I wouldn't take them in.
I wouldn't take them in, Edna.
They don't have any right."
She said...
"Yes, I know, they... wouldn't have the right."
Toby?
I wouldn't let you stay.
You...
You don't want us, do you, Toby?
You don't want us here.
What?
What do I want?
[laughs]
Do I wan?
Oh. [laughs]
Do I want you here?
[laughs]
You come in here, you come in here with your wife and with your terror.
And you ask me, "Do I want you here?"
Yes. Of course I want you here.
I built this house.
I want you in it.
I want your plague.
You have some terror with you?
Bring it in.
Bring it in!
You got the entrée, buddy.
You don't need a key.
You got the entrée, buddy. Forty years.
And you don't need to ask me, Harry.
[chuckles] Want, ask.
You come for dinner, don't you?
Come for cocktails.
See you at the club on Saturdays, and you talk and lie and laugh with us and pat old Agnes on the hand and you say, "Don't know what old Tobe would do without her.”
And we've known each other all these years, and we love each other, don't we?
[laughs] Don't we?
Don't we love each other?
Doesn't friendship grow to that? To love?
Doesn't 40 years amount to anything?
We've cast our lot together, boy.
We're friends.
We've been through lots of thick or thin together.
Which is it, boy?
Which is it, boy? Thick? Thin?
Well, whatever it is, we've been through it, boy.
[laughs] You don't have to ask.
I like you, Harry. [ like...
I really do.
I don't... like Edna, but that's not half the point. I like you fine.
I find my liking you has limits, but those are my... limits, not yours.
[scoffs]
The fact I like you well enough, but not enough, that best friend in the world should be something else, more, well, that's my poverty.
So... bring your wife, bring your terror,
Bring your plague.
- Bring your plague!
-[door opens]
I don't want you here.
You asked.
No, I don't!
But, by Christ, you're gonna stay here.
You've got the right. The right.
You know the word?
The right.
You've put nearly 40 years in it, baby.
So have I.
And if it's nothing, I don't give a damn.
You've got the right to be here.
You've earned it.
And, by God, you're gonna take it!
Do you hear me?
You bring your terror and you come in here... and you live with us.
You bring your plague and stay with us.
I don't want you here.
I don't love you.
But, by God, you stay!
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Please stay?
Stay. [cries]
Please?
Stay?
[sobs]
Harry, will you bring our bags down?
Maybe Tobias will help you.
Will you ask him?
[Harry] Sure.
Would you help us with the bags, old man?
Upstairs.
Poor Harry, he's not a callous man, for all his bluff.
He came to my bed last night, got in with me. L...
I let him stay and talk. I...
I let him think I wanted to make love.
It pleases him, I think, to know he would be wanted if he...
He said to me...
He lay there in the dark with me, this man, and he said to me, very softly, like a little boy, rather...
"Do they love us?
Do they love us, Edna?"
I let a silence go by.
"Well... as much as we love them,
I should think."
The hair on his chest is very gray and soft.
Would...
"Would we let them stay, Edna?"
Almost a whisper, then still again.
Well, I hope he told Tobias something simple.
Something to help.
We mustn't press our luck, must we?
Test.
It's sad to come to the end of it, isn't it?
Nearly the end.
So much more of it gone by than left, and still not know, still not have learned the boundaries, what we may not do, not ask for fear of... looking in a mirror.
- We shouldn't have come.
- Ah, Edna.
No, for our own sake, our own lack.
It's sad to know you've gone through it all, or most of it, without...
That the one body you've wrapped your arms around, the only skin you've ever known is your own.
And that it's dry... and not warm.
What will you do, Julia?
Will you be seeing Douglas?
I haven't thought about it.
I don't know. I doubt it.
Time.
Time happens, [ suppose, to people.
Everything becomes too late, finally.
You know it's going on up on the hill.
You can see the dust and hear the cries.
But you wait.
And time happens.
When you do go, sword, shield, finally... there's nothing there... but rust... bones.
And the wind.
[chuckles]
I'm sorry about the coffee, Edna.
The help must steal the beans.
The maids-- Or take them with them when they-- when they go to bed.
[Edna] Oh, coffee and wine, they're much the same with me.
I can't tell good from bad.
[Agnes laughs]
Would anybody, besides Claire, care for a drink?
Oh, oh, really, Claire.
- Edna?
- Oh, good heavens, Claire, thank you, no.
Julia?
All right, Twill. Thank you.
[Edna] I think I hear the men.
[Tobias] We'll just take these down to the car now.
[Edna] Thank you, Agnes.
You've been, well... Just thank you.
We'll be seeing you.
Oh, yes, well, don't be strangers.
[Edna] How could I be?
Our lives are the same.
Julia, think a little.
Hmm. I will, Edna. I'm fond of marriage.
Darling Claire.
- Do be good.
-[Claire] I'll try to be quiet.
[Edna chuckles]
I'm going into town on Thursday, Agnes.
Would you like to come?
Well, I-I-I don't think so, Edna.
I've so much to do.
Well, perhaps another week.
Oh, yes, we'll do it.
-[Tobias] All done?
-[Harry] All set.
[Agnes] Harry, my darling.
- Take good care.
- Thank you, Agnes, and--
You too, Julia.
You... be good.
Good-bye, Harry.
Bye, Harry. See you around.
Sure thing, Claire.
[Edna] Bye, Tobias.
[Edna, Tobias laugh]
- Thank you.
- Bye, Edna.
Thank you, old man.
Please stay.
See you at the club.
Well, Edna?
Drive carefully.
- It's Sunday.
-[Edna] Bye!
-[Harry] Thank you!
-[car engine starts]
[car engine rumbles]
[Agnes] Well, here we all are.
You all right, my darling?
Sure.
Your daughter has taken to drinking in the early morning,
- I hope you'll notice.
- Oh. [laughs]
Thad one here somewhere, one with Harry.
Oh, here it is.
I would seem to have three early-morning drinkers.
I hope it won't become a club.
We'd have to get a license, would we not?
Just think of it as very late at night.
[chuckles]
All right, Twill.
I tried.
Twas honest.
Didn't I?
Wasn't I?
You were very honest, Father, and you tried.
Didn't I try, Claire?
Wasn't I honest?
Sure you were. You tried.
I'm sorry. I...
Apologize.
What I find most astonishing, aside from my belief that I will one day lose my mind, but when?
Never, I begin to think, as the years go by.
Or that I'll not know if it happens or maybe even has.
What I find most astonishing, I think, is the wonder of daylight, of the sun.
All the centuries, millenniums, all the history.
I wonder if that's why we sleep at night.
Because the darkness still frightens us.
They say we sleep to let the demons out, to let the mind go raving mad, our dreams and nightmares, all our logic gone awry, the dark side of our reason.
And when the daylight comes again, comes order within.
Poor...
Edna and Harry.
Well... they're safely gone.
And we'll all forget quite soon.
Come now.
We can begin the day.
In 1963 World in Action made a film about these seven year old children they talked about their homes, their schools and what they wanted to be they were filmed again when they were fourteen we've brought them all together to watch the films because this year they are twenty-one what are they doing now?
How have they changed?
What sort of people are they?
Stop it at once!
Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man
When I leave the school I'm going to..
Colet Court and then I will be going to
Rossminster Boarding School if I pass the exam and then we think I'm going to
Cambridge and Trinity Hall
Well... before I'm old and that, enough to get a job
I'll just walk around and see what I can find
I want to be a jockey when I grow up yeah
When I leave school
I'm going to The
Dragon School, I might and after I might go to
Charterhouse Marlborough
What about university Charlie?
I might go to Oxford
What does university mean?
Well...
Well I don't think I need to go to university
'cause I'm not going to be a teacher
I don't think you have to go to university if you want to be an astronaut
When I leave this school
I'm down for Heathfield and Fairfield Manor and then maybe I may want to go to university but I don't know which one yet
I will buy myself a nice new made house, you know
One that's all nice and comfy
I'm going to work in Woolworths
Well, going to Africa and try and teach people who are not civilised to be, more or less good
When I grow up I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that
It's just that the limitations of such things as :
What the audience require and the time don't allow it to be a real study
I mean if we accept this then it....
Okay I think it's probably good entertainment
I don't think we've changed that much
I think we talk, no I don't mean looks
I mean the way we talk I don't think we've changed that much
Well you never lose an
Eastend accent do you
I tell you what, as it goes you've definitely changed
- You think so yeah?
- In facial
You haven't changed a bit have you?
Don't you think so?
I thought I'd got bigger
You might be about an inch bigger yeah
- An inch?
- I know it's unbelievable
That's something I did notice, the way our teeth have changed
Teeth?
Yes
- Mine were out like that and I had them shoved back - Well I noticed the ears actually
Have you not noticed that a lot of people... your ears have been made real fun about them
They've got they're conclusions settled already
They must
...met here today and we've seen the films and we feel as if we know everybody who is in the films now has broken any class barriers that could previously existed and therefore the film itself has possibly defeated its own object
- They do lead me on a bit don't they
- That's what I mean and they hype the program up too much
Yeah and make that you're good and I'm bad
- Or
- Well Vice-versa I think
- No don't be silly
- No I really do, especially the "7" one
People tend to read significance into it that I don't think exists
One of my friends for instance, had me pointed out to him as... being destined to run the farm and being educationally pretty inept, this is obvious from the film
At seven Nicholas was at a one room village school in the Yorkshire Dales
Do you have a girlfriend?
I don't want to answer that
I don't want answer those kind of questions
I thought that one would come up because when I was
When I was doing the other one somebody said
"what do you think about girls?" and I said "I don't answer questions like that" is that the reason you're asking it?
- yeah
- thought so
The best answer would be to say that I don't answer questions like that but I mean.. you know it was what I said when I was seven and it's still the most sensible but I mean, what about them?
Well you seemed at fourteen very shy of the whole sexual life, has that changed?
I've tried to make a change yes a very definite conscious effort not to be shy to be more outgoing and this is actually something I can put a point to in my own past and think yes I did make my mind up here, here and here that I was going to try and change this, this and this
"this" being basically my confidence and my my sort of approach to well this is to people in general
When I grow up I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that
I mean
I'm not when I said that I was interested in physics and chemistry well I'm not going to do that here
You might be able to get... somebody to ex... will you explain this to me again
Nicholas is now in his
2nd year at Oxford University
Well I'm trying to be a physicist to fill in the detail of whenever you meet somebody at university that the standard question is, where are you and what are you doing? and my answer is I'm at Merton
College and I'm doing Physics so it doesn't move up and down and just rotates
- OK
- Then you put it in
We'll give it a whirl
So what career are you going to pursue?
It depends whether I'll be good enough to do what I want to really do
I would like if I can to do research
Are there any disadvantages in coming from a small place like this and preparing yourself for Oxford?
Well it's a rather different background to go any where,
Oxford perhaps especially it is a rather more firm foundation I would've thought as to your character? I don't? perhaps character than being brought up in the city
It's a fixed reference point in a sense that sort of earthy life and death cycle that you get living on a farm so when something dies it rots and feeds back into the earth
Sometimes it's helpful in a city where things that some people are very concerned about seem quite irrelevant
Is there a new strength of your father as a farmer that you think he's trying to teach you
Well you get a certain sort of calmness in some situations take things as they come you become resigned to things if the dog's chasing animals in the wrong direction then you just have to put up with it if it won't do as it's told you become resigned to these things
I suppose yes that's one possibility come on come on lad
I suppose of all the seven year olds the original ones, you are the big success
I am not inclined to accept that
Why? You wouldn't agree with that?
Well what have I achieved?
I'm not really prepared to accept that
I've done anything very special yet
I'd like to think that....I mean I'm hoping that I might do at some stage but I don't really think I've done anything that you can call a great success
It would seem really ridiculous to any of my friends who watch this if I said
"Christ aren't I a great success, look at me"
Well what? You know, what success?
I can't think of it in those terms
I haven't done anything that can be called success nothing out of the ordinary really
Singing Waltzing
Matilda in Latin at an exclusive pre-preparatory school in London
Charles
Andrew and John
I think it's not a bad idea to pay for schools because if we didn't schools would be so nasty and crowded
Yes, so do I think so
The poor people would come rushing in and the man in charge of the school would...
Would you think there's any truth in the ideas behind the program that certain people have more options than others and this is undesirable?
It's certainly true that more people know they have more options or imagine they have
I think in practical terms the difference in numerical number of options isn't that great the fact is that the three of us know that there's a whole range of things we can do
But the mere knowledge creates an option in itself, so I think we do have more options and it is undesirable but it's very difficult to correct
I don't think it is undesirable at all
I think what's undesirable is people who have had options don't make advantage of them, take best advantage of them but I can't see there's anything wrong as long as people don't abuse the opportunities and privileges they've had
If people behave responsibly
I think it's very good they're the sort of stability and structure in society
We've been taught to expect more it's not that because we've been to private schools we're not better qualified necessarily
- No
- Yes I agree with that
It's a matter of expectations
Yes I must say, all this talk about opportunities something I did slightly object to in the program was we were shown at the age of seven outlining the academic career that most of us did in fact pursue each sentence ended up
"John is at Westminster"
Andrew is at Charterhouse and everything implied that we just sailed through, merely manifesting an intention at the age of seven we didn't show the sleepless nights, the pouring over our books sort of, you know all the sweat and toil that got us through to university it was presented as if it was just part of some indestructible birth right that we went to all these places and I thought that was unfair, they didn't show us having to do beastly jobs in the holidays y'know, to make ends meet and things it didn't give a very real sort of...impression
The three girls are earning income wise they're far better off than
I imagine all three of us are, certainly I am and background wise in terms of qualifications or the means of achieving their ends they probably have just as many options as we do
Jaqueline how do you think about coloured people?
Well they're nice, they're just the same as us really but, one thing it's only 'cause their skin's brown and we're white sort of pinkish we are
Jackie, Lynn and Susan they went to primary school together in the Eastend of London
Lynn chose to go on to a grammar school and Jackie and Susan to a comprehensive
There is a danger that you would get married at early twenties and have children quickly and then be stuck at home have you any thoughts on that?
- I don't really think about it much
- No
I don't think I'd eh.... get married to early
I'd like to have a full life first and
- I'd like to enjoy myself before I...
- Meet people and...yeah
Before you can commit yourself to a family
What would you do if you had lots of money? about two pounds
I would buy myself a nice new made house you know one that's all nice and comfy
Jackie was married last year and now lives on a new estate in Essex
- It's a nice estate
- Yeah - Yeah not bad at all
What are they like the neighbours?
Have you seen a lot of them or what?
Well you know, to say hello to more than anything, I mean we borrow things off of her, which is just as well
- That's what neighbours are for isn't it?
- Yeah right!
Here, It's a similar colour scheme down here moving up stairs isn't it?
Yeah but this was more by luck than judgement really
- Was it like this when you came?
- No it was all white but you can imagine the state it was in friends had some paint handy so Dad and Mick just used the rollers and in a day it was done two coats, wallop! that was it
Susan is still single
I work for a travel company they don't deal with the public, they deal with groups and company groups it's sort of incentive, holidays abroad and conferences, that sort of thing which I like because
I like foreign places and I have to do eh....
I do quite a bit of typing but a lot of my work is involved in making bookings and dealing with hotels abroad
I left school and started work... for an Australian bank and I'm still there and I've been there what?
Three and a half years now
I've done various jobs within the bank
I started off as a telephonist-typist which was very interesting actually, you'd be surprised the sort of calls you get
Then I went on to work the NCR machine which is the actual machine that processes the accounts and counter work dealing with clients money and things like that
I'm going to work in Woolworths
Well I'm a school mobile librarian and assistant to the young peoples office
Which is where we are now and I've been here since August last year
Lynn is now married but still lives and works in the Eastend
I visit schools with the van where they've not got position to get into a local library for class visits
I love working with children do you remember on the last one I wanted to teach?
Well I didn't get to that and seeing how it is today I'm glad I didn't the job situation for all teachers as it is and I think it takes a lot more patience than I've actually got
I'm much more at home here
- Have I stamped yours?
- Yes
I've not stamped yours
Sleeping Beauty
I've lost the stamp!
Do you sleep like a beauty?
What do you say?
Thank you
I definitely make a point in reading all my new books I get in
It's quite funny, I take loads of books home and people come and say "who are these kids books on the table?"
- "They're mine"
- "Oh"
Then they sort of shut up
At the moment a career's probably about the furthest thing from my mind and I don't really know what I'm aiming for except to get the house together and that can take years, as fast as you replace one thing something else needs replacing, so ... it could just go on like that, I don't know
Well admitting that you're not a career girl does it mean that you're therefore looking for a family?
Oh I don't know,
I suppose I am
But erm.. every thing's not that cut and dried it's not either career or family or... but is what's in the middle, am I just going to carry on as I am now? for? and end up .....on the shelf? or am I just going to get married? could be any day, but
I suppose Lynn is a career girl in a way isn't she?
Yeah she's more wrapped up in her job than I think we are and you all three were sat there at seven and she's gone that way and you've gone this way is there? can you?.... think of any reasons why that should be?
I think just basic personality, Lynn's always been that little bit different from us
She's always been more serious as far as studies are concerned
I didn't feel like going to a grammar school, I just er... you know, comprehensive school it just seemed more friendly
At that time that is, but now a little bit different
- Grammar school's fantastic
- If you say so!
When I leave this school
I'm down for Heathfield and Fairfield Manor and then maybe I may want to go to university but I don't know which one yet
This is Susie the product of a private education and wealthy parents
What do you think about making this program?
I just think it's ridiculous, I don't see any point in doing it
Why not?
What's the point of people going into peoples lives and saying:
"Why do you like this and why don't you?" I don't see any point in it
Well I didn't want to do it when I was fourteen
I know I was very difficult because I was very anti doing it because I was pressurised into doing it by my parents and I hated it and I vowed I'd never do it now but here I am
I'd like to do... short hand typing or something like that
I left school when I was sixteen, went to Paris went to secretarial college and got a job
What made you decide to leave school and go to Paris?
I just wasn't interested in school and just wanted to get away and why did you choose Paris?
I don't know, it was my parents really
Did you sort of feel the need to get away? and why?
Well I'd lived in
London or Scotland and I knew people who were going out to Paris and so I thought I'd go as well
Comparing yourselves to Susie who stands at the other end of the social scale do you think you've had the same opportunities as her?
I've had the opportunities in life that I've wanted
I'd say I've had more opportunities than Susie
I'd say I've had more opportunities than her in a different aspect to what she's had them
But eh, my life,  I've been able to do more or less what I wanted to do
I'm not going to say it on film, what i feel for her
But I think she's been so conditioned into what she should do and what she shouldn't do
Yeah but I mean
The whole thing is you're saying
"do we envy anything Susie's had?"
No
I mean I don't know
I don't know what Susie's had, what's Susie had that I haven't had?
I mean, until I know that I can't honestly say whether I envy her
- She's had money and she's travelled
- I've got money!
Maybe not enough but I've got it!
I have been to Honolulu with my father about two years ago for a couple of months which I didn't really enjoy there's nothing much out there, there's no meet people my own age out there and I hated it and I was glad to come home apart from that I've been to France on holidays
I'm going to Australia in the summer for about two months otherwise I don't know where I'm going to go and I'd like to go and travel more
Why?
Well I don't think there's any point in sitting in your own country
I'd like to see how people live on the other side of the world
Tell me about the
Australian trip
Well I'm going in July for about two months with my cousin her elder sister's married out there and we're just going out to.... see what it's like we're going to not work out there, we're only going for two months
We just feel if we don't go now we never will
We've got the opportunity and the time to go now so we're going
How are you going to pay for it?
Save up and go
Do you get depressed by money problems?
No, why?
Why should you?
- If you can manage on what you've got
- I refuse to get depressed over money
- It's so easy to but why should you?
- I do, I do
Why worry about it?
When I reach the 18th day of the month and my mortgage is due on the 20th and there's nowhere near enough money in there, I get depressed about it obviously
Suddenly thinking, oh my god what's going to happen, you know
But it gets there, don't ask me how but you get it
Do you think you've settled down to young?
No
I've married and we do things together, or...
I go out on my own sometimes with friends from work he does the same, what do you mean by settled down?
If you think that getting married as far as we're concerned is a case of going to work, come home, cook tea for hubby, going to bed, getting up, going to work you're totally mistaken
Did you meet enough men before you decided who to marry?
I've been married a year and... a couple of months you do think "christ, what have I done?"
- See I've still got my ideals
- and I'm being honest about it! and my husband thinks the same, at times you think "christ, what have I done?"
- But then if...
- But marriage...
Marriage means a different thing to me
I've still got my ideals about marriage, I don't know what it's all about, obviously
So I've still got pictures of
- Cosy evenings indoors...yeah
- With roses!
She'd have cosy evenings indoors with the central heating!
Or lack of it!
- Yeah, I've got a lot to learn about .... getting married
I mean, your parents split up soon after you were fourteen
What sort of influence, effect did that have on you?
Well I was the only child going through their parents splitting up aged 14 at a very vulnerable age and it does touch you up, but...
You know, you get over it
There was no point in them staying together for me if it was worse,
I mean the rows and... and it's worse so if two people can't live together there's no point in making yourself even for the sake of children
What is your attitude towards marriage? for yourself?
Well I don't know, I haven't given it a lot of thought as I'm very cynical about it
But then you get a certain amount of faith restored in it
I mean I've got friends and their parents are happily married and it does put faith back into you but me myself I'm very cynical about it
Why?
Because I think it kills whatever love is it just seems to go wrong
What do you base that on?
Well, people I've seen, people around me
I mean I've got....not a lot of my friends are married a lot of people who are 20,30 all seem to be getting divorced and can't stay together and at the moment I just don't really believe in it
Why do you think people can't hold marriages together?
I don't know, I really don't know
I don't sort of sit down and think "ooh ...analyse marriage"
It's not something I've had to think about whether I was going to get married and I've got no desire to at the moment, I think twenty is far too young
What was the wedding like?
Our wedding? a laugh!
I wanted, white wedding, all trimmings
My husband would've been satisfied with very little but being as we were going into it as a full thing we went into it
I had an all white wedding, all white
We were both in white and my bridesmaid was in white
It's a funny day actually because I suppose I was up somewhere around the five o'clock mark and I spent all day preparing well all morning I should say and then sitting around for about three hours just waiting for something to happen then when it did happen I don't remember it
So it was just complete confusion really
- It was a nice day though
- Oh yeah
It was funny actually, you can imagine some of the comments
I was pleased I was there, it seemed the right place to be
I mean I was glad I was at her wedding, I've known her a long while
Did anything happen?
Anything funny?
I can’t forget the cake
It was horrific really, the cake what happened to the wedding cake it was sitting right in between Mick and myself suddenly the columns just completely gave way and it just all fell into one
- It was a nice cake though!
- Yeah it wasn't bad!
I read the Financial Times
I read the Observer and the Times
What do you like about it?
Well I like...
I usually look at the headlines then read about them about it
I like my newspaper because
I've got shares in it
- and I know every day what the shares are
- The stuff that misers like you like!
But on Monday's they don't move up so I don't look at it
That's one of the troubles with this sort of program, I don't really think that people like us
Unless we're seven and being rather funny, have very much to say that's... very interesting, because I mean... we don’t know very much
Well we didn't know very much when we were seven
- But we were still quite funny
- We were at least funny!
- Yes! - Yes!
- In ourselves!
I agree with John, all we can say is what we think and if that's of interest to people, good luck to them
Yes and I can't believe it is
More fool them!
When I leave this school
I'm going to College Court then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam and then we think I'm going to
Cambridge and Trinity Hall
John is in his final year at
Christchurch Oxford, reading Law
I do believe parents have a right to educate their children as they think fit
I think someone who works on an assembly line in a car factory, earning a huge wage could well afford to send their children to private school if they wanted to
Just because.. some sort of people perhaps don't put that as high on their priorities as... having a smart car or something
I don't think that's any reason for abolishing public school
I think an awful lot more people could afford to send their sons to school
You know, to fee paying school
But they don't choose to, and that's their choice
I'm going to Charterhouse and after that,
Trinity Hall Cambridge
Andrew is in his last year at Trinity
College Cambridge, reading Law
I think if people earn their money they should have a right to spend it an education is very important and you can never be sure of leaving your children any worldly goods but at least you can be sure that once you've given them a good education that's something that no one can take away
What about university Charlie?
I might go to Oxford
You're reading history at Durham
University, you didn't make Oxford
What are your feelings about that?
I don't mind at all
In fact
I'd say I'm pleased I didn't because it was very much a sort of sort of set of
Marlborough Prep School
Marlborough, Oxbridge, conveyor belt you get shoved out at the end and you... when you go to Oxbridge and it's obviously not true in all cases but
I think for the majority they mix with the same people they were at school with
So what attracts you to Oxford?
Well first of all it's such a beautiful place there's more to it than just studying away at one's books
I think it's very difficult not to get something out of it there’s such a sort of... atmosphere of culture and... and timelessness about the place that
I think you do sort of mature an awful lot
So what is Beagling?
Beagling is the hunting of the hare with a pack of hounds, done on foot
I mean a lot of people seem to imagine a days hunting with either fox to hunt or beagles unadulterated butchery.
I mean this just isn't true, I think
I wish people had a more realistic idea of what it's about
The hounds are over there I think
I saw them last streaming along that hedge there
- Frustrating isn't it?
- Yes
I'm reasonably old fashioned about some things but I mean
I mean people who go on a lot about the permissive society are missing the point if they think the only thing that's wrong is sex
I think you know, decreasing respect for the family as a unit increasing dishonesty, both in business.... there used to be much more much stronger developed ideas of commercial integrity than seem to be going around nowadays, nowadays people seem to be out for themselves
I really do think I suppose there is an invasion by the American way of life which I think is a very sad thing
Is that unstoppable?
That trend do you think?
I think it really is unfortunately, yes
So where does that leave your values?
Well it leaves them with me and my future children whom
I shall implicate them in
But do you not find yourself isolated?
That really doesn't matter
If I believe my principals are right and I'm doing the right thing to bring my children up by them it won't matter to me whether
I'm living in the middle-ages mentally
I shall do what's right
Well when I was very small my father always used to go ski-ing and he took me with him and we've been ever since really and how old or young were you when you started?
Oh about five, on tiny little ski's it was quite frightening then what is the appeal of it?
Well the sort of freedom and going in the snow and the mountains and the feeling of speed and getting away from people if you can
Do you save up to come ski-ing or...?
I don't but my father does as he pays for me
Your parents have been divorced since fourteen
- Since you were fourteen
- That's right, quite recently yes
Tell me about that and the influence it's had on you
Well not much influence in fact because it's happened when I'm quite old and I'm away from home a lot anyway it's very sad of course but I don't think it has had a great deal of influence if it had happened when I was much younger it would've had much more influence an adverse influence
I would've thought
Did your parents divorce leave any lasting mark on you?
I don't know, I mean seen the film at fourteen so and that's of our closest time,
I would've thought it did but... don't talk about that anyway so...
Why?
I think it's unfair on them
Very few parents I think, bring up their children... with the intention of belittling them or doing as little for them as possible
I think you have to assume that most parents do as much as they can given the circumstances of the children and obviously things could've been far worse
Do you think it's changed your attitude to marriage? or...
It just means that because I was faced with that situation I have an attitude which is a positive attitude rather than "well everybody else gets married therefore I shall get married"
My attitude would be that if one is going to have children if you want to have children then that's a very real reason for getting married but if you get married... it's an agreement to make the thing work for eighteen years or however long it is until the children have grown up no there's no point in just sitting it out for eighteen years there's nothing worse than that, it would be better for the parents to get a divorce
I think people perhaps don't make as much effort as they should have, or should do to make marriages work it's very easy for me to say so as
I've never been in the position
In what way should people make more effort?
I think people just take too much for granted when they get married or used to, not now perhaps
I mean, I don't know about you for instance
I know my mother, she's said that she's spoilt really and she never realised how lucky she'd been until she'd been divorced
Up to about twelve maybe it's different with other people, but
I found that you're much more attached to your parents once you come to about thirteen, fourteen you're not quite so attached to them
I think the system of having house captains is rather good because when somebody is naughty the house captain asks him and... and has a talk to him once I had a talk to Grevil, he was in my house and
I asked Sir if he could put him out of my house because he was always getting minuses
What did Sir say?
Sir said that he would... we would see about it this term
Well I think it's a very good system
Have you had to speak to anyone?
- Just because you are one I suppose?
- No, no I haven't!
- You're not are you?
- But I am!
Straw, Mac and Nessie got three minuses in a day
If I work in Law I should like a reasonable amount of success
I shouldn't like to be on the bread-line which is all to common
I'd like to be a Solicitor and, also fairly successful
I only know what I don't want and that's a nuclear family in a semi-detached in Brentford
Do you three see yourselves... staying in England, living in England, making your careers in England?
Yes
Well the trouble is Law is not really very exportable
From my point of view anyway
I quite like England
'cause I can't say I really approve very much of the sort people who emigrate
I mean it's too easy for people who... this is where I would agree with you about people who have had opportunities
I do think they've got a corresponding duty to sort of put back.... you know, people who have had things going well for them really ought to stay and help the country out when things aren't going very well
I don't believe in all this pulling one's money out but that's a moral point of view, I do believe people have the right to live where they like and also to move their assets around but on a moral level I do feel very strongly that people shouldn't quit
- Is that why you don't want to leave?
- Yes and also I can't imagine anywhere so nice as England
Probably stay in England for the reasons that
John put forward, I think one has a moral duty
It sounds terrible but,  you know...if...
It's up to one certainly to make an attempt to put something back in to whatever it is that you're doing in England
Having used the various facilities that are put out for you by the state
I think the more you've had out of the country the more privileges you're born with the greater your duty is
We chose two boys from a children's home in Middlesex
Paul
Say you had a wife say you had to eat what they cooked you and say I don't like vegetables, well I don't and say she said "you have to eat what you get"
So I don't like vegetables so say she gives me vegetables then that's it
Well as far as I know my mother and father got... well they separated originally I think they eventually got divorced
I went to the boarding school for one year then we emigrated to Australia my father got remarried and how do you get on with your step-mum? pretty well but like I said before I'm just not close enough
I'm not really close to my father either
Paul left the children's home when he was eight
Our other boy stayed until he was thirteen
Symon
Was it difficult moving from the home back to live with your mother?
- You're still here after, eight years now?
- Yeah yeah
Well I find it's comfortable
See I can get on well with my mother sometimes well that's good because a lot of ... young children can't get on with their parents at all at this time of the year, their life but I get on pretty well with my mum now we talk very well with each other but it's.. sometimes not quite as mother and son sort of more like friends
What sort of life does your mother have?
Well it seems hard, I mean she's always been... nervous not all the time, but... she has periods of depression or deep depression or whatever you want to call it that sort of makes me think
"well what happened there?"
What effect has that had on you do you think?
Well it's made me very sort of protective towards her
I feel I've got to help her all the time
They say "Where's your father then?"
You know when your mums out at work "Where's your father?" and I just tell them
I ain't got one
What effect has that had on you?
Well I don't think it's had any effect on me, 'cause... what you don't have you don't miss
Twenty years ago when I was born an illegitimate child, you know that's something that's only whispered about people feel strongly about it in those days but nowadays it's.. it's not a serious matter the serious point is whether you stay with someone or you leave them
We took Paul and Symon round the buildings which were once the children's home
I remember this path but I've never walked on it was out of bounds the only place I saw this was from out the windows and that
- What was that there?
- That? That was eh...
That was hospital juniors, that's where we used to be
- Really?
- Yeah
I don’t like the big boys
Hitting us and... and the staff is up in the washroom sends the nurse out,
"well there's no talking"
"No I wasn't talking today"
Then Brown sent me out for nothing
Remember the tiles?
- No not really
- Yeah I remember them when they were cleaner
- I remember the two offices
- Yeah the doctors and the nurses
Some things gone
- The seats
- Yeah the seats
The smell, the smells gone
- Remember Midgely
- Yeah
He was a real bastard
I remember one night,
I forget what I actually did
But he made me clean all the shoes in the house there was about fifty pair of shoes and took about two hours or something
Well I feel like joining in when there's already a fight
Ah do you remember Froggy Page?
No
He was the tailor
- I remember him
- Tailor?
Yeah he was here for thirty-seven years or something bent over backwards or bent over forwards or something
- The golf course
- Yeah
Used to think about running away over that when you'd get scared
That's where the headmaster's son used to shoot the squirrel's off the trees isn't it - yeah
Do you remember the boy that in the senior part where my brother was, he he was sleeping one time and he went out the second story window
Oh the sleep walker,
Weaver, Robert Weaver
- We all had to pray for him
- Yeah
- Everybody said he had a steel plate in his head
- Yeah
How have you got on with Symon? after you haven't seen him for fourteen years
Well I didn't recognise him at all
I think we got along really well, I don't know what he'd say to that but
I found him very likeable
He's just the sort of person who if I could I'd like to do something for them
Because I feel I've got, no offence to him, but I feel I've got more than him
It's just that it seems to me that things have fallen into line now for me
Every thing's started to come good, I've started to enjoy life and I've started to think
"well I'm not a no hoper"
Because I think that's what
I've always thought about myself
I know I didn't have any confidence in myself despite what I said when I was fourteen
I've always lacked confidence
I still do to a certain extent but nothing nothing like I did say when I was fourteen
The job I'm in, I mean, brick laying
I mean I enjoy it, it interests me and I'm very content at work in June last year I was made a junior partner though that was through circumstances but I look at it this way
I'm not great with my life but if I wasn't good enough and my boss didn't think I was good enough he would've never made me a junior partner as for the job you know, you build a house then you turn around and look at it and say "well I did that" it's better than having a whole row of figures it's substance you know, there's something there
Symon works in the freezer room of a meat company near his home in Middlesex
My job’s running away from me
You do jobs which I suppose are fairly routine and dull
- Yeah
- What keeps you going during them?
Oh it's definitely the people there
You work up a kind of team spirit there, y'know what I mean
You can ..... think about all the work you've got to do in the morning and you just don't want to go but once you get there just sort of generally....
I was going to say messing around there, I won't say that the managers might see it sort of joking about they make you feel you want to get the work done
Go out and get some just ask for them and we always say when we come out of the chiller we don't want to go back in but when we get back in we get on with it
So are you a good time keeper?
Ah it depends
Usually I try to get to work early but I have periods of where I just say "sod it" if I get there I get there
I think the hardest thing is to get up in the morning for me it takes a great deal out of me now
Do you never feel you should be doing better jobs than these?
Aren't you worth more than this?
No I haven't really
I suppose I just like hard work, I don't know
But eh...
It's never really sort of worried me
I suppose it should but it just hasn't and how do you see the future as far as work goes?
Well I know I can't stay at Walls forever, I mean it's just not me
I couldn't stay there for that long, my mind would go dead
But eh...
I think if I really wanted to
I could learn a trade, even now
Y'know if I really felt that I ought to get out and do something different
I could learn a trade if I wanted to and what would you like to be doing say in seven years?
Well I couldn't really say I haven't thought one year ahead yet
I think I'm still sort of young in my head
I don't really sort of take things seriously
All I want out of life is to be happy and when I say happy I want to be happily married as well because I can't say I don't want to get married because I think I do but I want to be happily married y'know therefore I want to make sure I think
How would you define happiness? What is it?
Basically to me it's the will to live
I mean, me I literally love life, I love people
I mean I think before I didn't
I mean, when I was fourteen I said
I've forgotten what the question was but I said something about I want to be alone and when I said that I know even now I meant that if someone had dropped me out in the Sahara Desert
I probably would've been happy more or less if you get the point
Whereas I'm not like that now,
I'd sooner be around people
I don't like doing things by myself and happiness to me is a love for life and a love for people
I think I admire people with great determination y'know like people who just come up from nothing they build up their life from absolutely nothing
I could say Muhammad Ali because he absolutely came from nothing
I mean you can't agree with everything he says but his word goes down now he's the biggest thing in sport he's one of the biggest things in life
I mean people like him
What when you look at yourself do you think your weaknesses and strengths are?
I think my main weakness is
I don't really take a grip of life
I don't really look...
I always look deeply into it but it just seems to be ... just a sort of hobby with me, I look at everything and I criticise it and I work everything out but after that I just sort of leave it
I find it hard to express emotion most of the time although I'm getting on top of that more happy now? just the simple things to say to Susan, y'know "I love you" or something like that
I mean I can tell you about it but
I really haven't been able to say it freely to Susan
I suppose that's a weakness
Do you have a dream?
A dream? not....
Not so much a dream but I know if I ever wanted to get on I could do it
I mean I always feel that I've got something inside me that would make me move
But eh...
I think what it is really is I'm just waiting for an excuse to use it
Y'know at the moment I feel ok just getting on with my life just sort of keeping up but I know if I really wanted to I could get on
It'll only take a little spark with me to do it
Is it important to fight? Yes
Would everybody please sit round now and get on with their work
I don't want to see any backs to me
Shouldn't be anybody turning round, Tony do you hear aswell?
Get on with your work in front
Tony!
Don't turn round again
I want to be a jockey when I grow up yeah I want to be a jockey when I grow up
Tony left his Eastend secondary modern school at fifteen and became an apprentice at
Tommy Gosling's racing stables in Epsom
This is a photo finish of when I rode at Newberry
I'm the one with the white cap
I was beaten a length and a half for third and had a photo finish so I took it out the box and kept it as a souvenir
Have you any other pictures of you as a jockey?
Yeah I've got a lot of them
Show me that one
That one when I was at Windsor that was my last ride on the old horse, Sharrod Heath that was he was a lovely old horse,
I'll never forget him
How many rides did you have?
Only three
Why was that?
Well obviously if I was good enough I would've had more that was the first day I ever put myself in jockey silks that was my first ride ever
How did it feel like?
It feel like there's no words that can explain how it felt that one was when I was going to the parade ring
They're not very good my brother, I mean he's not no good at taking photos
He's no Lord Snowdon
But describe the feeling, go on
Describe, well....I mean I..
Frankie Durr right, he was told to look after me so I went in there I said "I don't know my first ride" and he said "alright don't worry, your boss has told me to look after you" and so
I was changing into my silks and I felt good y'know, I could see all the faces that I think and when I look at the newspaper I think, Jeff Lewis, Frankie Durr and...
I thought to myself all of a sudden I'm in the same room getting changed
Then I walked in the parade room the parade ring and eh... and all my family's there and they're all going "Go on Tone!" and the boss came over and he said you've got to do this to the horse, you hold him back, you go half pace keep your hands down, keep him in the rails and I'm going "yeah yeah" like, nod and all of a sudden when he said "Jockeys please mount" and the bell went "Ding ding" and my heart just sunk because I thought to myself
Here I was yesterday a sort of nobody and here I am today, I'm king like
I felt king for one day, well for ten minutes
Do you regret not making it?
Well I would've given my right arm at the time to become a jockey
But now... well I wasn't good enough, it's as easy as that
What will you do if you don't make it as a jockey?
I don't know
If I knew I couldn't be one I'd get out of the game wouldn't bother and what do you think you would do then?
Learn taxi's
Taxi driver
I will be a cab driver right, how can I fail?
I got one brother taxi driver pulling me and the other brother pushing me so I got to make it
I will be a cab driver and I know I will and I'm going to prove every person who thinks I can't be a cab driver wrong and I'm going to get that badge and put it right in their face just to tell them how wrong they can be and how under estimated I am
Doing the taxi knowledge means Tony going out on his motorbike every day and learning the hundreds of routes round the streets of London
Well I can just get up, go on my bike, do two runs, come home call them over then boom, I've done my days work then I go out here and earn my money
Hackney Wick it's my sort of living
I can say until the time
I am a cab driver
But  mean my freedom's here and that is the main thing what I want
Tony spends his spare time at Hackney Wick
Greyhound Stadium placing bets for the punters
Fifty-five to twenty Boris
Five to one Cooladine
Four and a half fifty's, four and a half fifty's
Poor-Sunshine fourteen to one
Take it, take it!
If your father gambles you always looked upon how he gambles
I tried my luck and see what he does and I took it from there, it's sort of in you some people drink and they can't get out of drinking, some people smoke and can't stop smoking well I think I'm firmly on the ground as a gambler
I know you can't win gambling, putting money on the dogs and horses, I know that
But when you put other peoples money on you can't lose
What do they call you here?
I reckon a pest, or something like that
'cause I'm always running and doing everything that I shouldn't be doing
I thought I was going to get barred one day 'cause I used to...
Well I don't mean to make a nuisance of myself
I mean if the other patrons of the place they don't want to see a little boy nipping between their feet running, putting a bet on for a person
You understand? they think "cor what's he doing is he mad?"
I mean I walk up there
I order the teas
There could be eight people in front of me, I just go...
Can I have a tea please, tea please, five times tea please tea please and they've got to serve me before them to get rid of me, do you understand?
So that’s how you've got to do it
Just keep on and on and on and they go
"oh driving me mad, here you are, get rid of him" it's as easy as that
That's the way to get on in life, just be a noise, annoyed annoyance all the time to a person and they go
"oh he's driving me mad, get him away from me and more or less they give you the first option sort of find that
You're very short, has that had much trouble?
Well a bird said to me the other day
She said "ain't you small"
So I said "but you're ugly at least I can grow"
What can they say to that? they can't say nothing can they? to a thing like that, or... or example...
She said to me "Ain't you small" so I looked at her tits and she was only about a thirty
I said "But you're not too big either so we're both in the same way"
- Have you got a girlfriend?
- No
Would you like to have a girlfriend?
No
Do you understand "The Four F's?"
Find the, feed them, forget them for the other F I'll let you use your own discrimination
I mean... this one
I tried to do the three F's but I couldn't forget her
I'd done the three F's but I couldn't forget her
It sounds silly but that's the only way I can put it
Tell me about the family, are you fairly closely knit?
Well I love them all
There's not one I don't love more than the other, other than my mum obviously but your mum is the root of the tree, you love your mum best
So what do you like about living in the Eastend?
It's very sort of real, there's nothing false only the police!
I'm firmly placed and there's no way I can see getting out, I wouldn't want to get out really
It's very hard to make it in the Eastend because the roots are firmly stuck in the ground and you've got to have a big hard pull to get them out
So are there many villains in the Eastend?
There has been in the time I suppose the originals were the Kray twins
We're in Vallance Rd now, as it goes they used to live here in a house they used to call Fort Vallance
'cause it was that hard to get into I expect
Do you have much to do with villains?
I can't say I have much to do,
I wouldn't say I'm a villain myself
I don't go thieving and don't do anybody any harm fighting wise
I'm trying to say that
Wherever you go there's villains and whether you mix with them or not it's up to you
Does it worry you the possibility of becoming one of them?
How can I become a villain?
If it's not in there, it's not born in there you won't become one
Don't you think you're going to regret not having an education?
Where does that come into it? it doesn't come into it in my mind?
Education is just a thing to say
"my son is higher than him" or "my son had a better background than him"
I mean
I'm as good or even better than most of them people especially on this program
I mean
On one of the trailers you'll think oh the Eastend boy and he ain't got a no good education but all of a sudden the Eastend boy's got a car and a motorbike and he goes to Spain every year and whatever and have I worked for it?
No I'm here putting bets on and you think "how does he do it?" and there's a boy, who's he? and whatever he's studying to be a professor, he's making up things
They're mainly education, there's no education in this world
Just one big rat race and you've got to kill your man next to you to get in front of him
What do you think about trade unions and things like that?
I don’t under know I don't
I don't know enough to know about them if you understand me
I mean
I'm not a politician so let them worry about what's coming for the next day all I understand is dogs, prices, girls, knowledge, roads, streets, squares and mum and dad and love that's all I understand that's all I want to understand
Here you are
Come on three chase it
Come on boy
Go on three inside
Come on three???
He's checking everywhere....
Well going to Africa and try and teach people who are not civilised to be more or less good
No I don't want to be a missionary because
I just can't talk about it to people
Y'know, I am interested in it myself but I wouldn't be very good at it at all and I wouldn't enjoy it
Why wouldn’t you be good at it
Well I'm just not very good at... at standing up in front of people and making a speech or anything like that
I'd like to keep it private, y'know
Is it possible you might ever think of going to the church?
It is possible, I've never said no definitely
But I wouldn't be doing it after I go to university
I mean it's just possible in ten years time I suppose
What would draw you to the church?
I don't know, it wouldn't be dissatisfaction with whatever I'm doing at the moment
In a way
If whatever I was doing I was doing very successfully then that would be a better reason for going into the church really or at least if I did go into the church it would meant I was giving something up
But
I think the wrong reasons are if you are dissatisfied with what you're doing in the general sense of doing a job badly or a failure in some sort of way
Bruce is in his final year at University
College Oxford, reading mathematics and by Eisenstien you can show that this is irreducible then you do a transformation on this ???? x = to T+2 which you find is T cubed plus
17 squared plus 14 T plus 7 and you observe that seven which is a prime divides the co-efficient of T squared
T and the constant, not T cubed and seven squared doesn't divide the constant term so by Eisenstien this is irreducible so therefore two cross, two by seven is of degree three and that length isn't constructable from the quarry of our original theorem so therefore the septagon's not constructable
Well that's a nice way of doing it, particularly using Eisenstien down here his test is very popular, he was an interesting mathematician
What sort of job are you going to try for?
Well there was one job, I'd like to make maps really and it's nice sort of outdoor life you go to...I mean you travel around and eh... but there are very few jobs like that going
I'm sort of qualified, a general maths or science degree would do or geography degree
But eh...
I think I've probably missed it this time round and eh....but that's only.... perhaps I won't like making maps, it's something that I think I would do
Millbrook probably had a great influence on me in a way
I mean I was absolutely shocked rigid when I went to my prep school and found people who thought of doing things wrong
I never really upset anyone or questioned authority or misbehaved in any of my two later schools which may seem an ideal thing but it's probably healthy to question why you have to do certain things which I never did
Bruce was a border at this pre-preparatory school from the age of five
Squad left foot in one place squad breathe in
Well it is mainly this lack of responsibility for doing jobs given to me people will say "why haven't you done this? Look you've upset us"
I was secretary of bridge society, chess society, cricket society
Scottish dancing society and I didn't do anything for any of them, they were all very angry and I spent last summer term in total seclusion
I saw maybe half a dozen people all term in my room, darting across courts people would say "I saw Balden today" and they'd say "No? really?" it was awful really
My hearts desire is to see my daddy who is six thousand miles away
Y'know I've been getting on well with my step-father and I like seeing my father occasionally and he does come over from Rhodesia
What effect has the fact that you've seen very little of your father had on you?
Nothing really, I only
...something I regret that...
I didn't really get to know him better at all
We've written and we're both very bad writers, I'm probably worse than him and eh... that's something I regret is not having a just a regular correspondence because I think he's an interesting man actually and eh... he probably regrets it as well
What do you think about your own upbringing? what have been the strongest influences on that?
Probably to not let down my mother really because she's worked awfully hard to get me through school and
I haven't let her down yet then.. as far as...eh
...not having... my mothers divorce
I don't think that really has the effect that people imagine it to have
I mean I always have got on well with my stepfather and with my half-sister, so in that sense I've had a family life
I'd help people if I had a chance
Y'know by say giving a little bit of money to charity or sponsoring things or things like that
Well I took nine months off between school and university and there I taught at a school and worked in the Banbury sewage works two months
What sort of school was it?
Well I never like admitting this but it was a handicapped school
I mean it seems to present me as wanting to do these things
I suppose in a way I do, and
I do get some satisfaction from doing it, but....
I could so easily have done something else it was just almost an accident that
I ended up at the spastic school and eh...
I'm glad I did it because I enjoyed it not for its....
I suppose slightly charitable nature of the work, but the people I met, work, it was quite good
Why are you frightened of presenting this image of yourself
It's...
It’s possibly because I
I don't know, I never want to feel to proud really
I mean it's dangerous for a start and it's so easy and it doesn't work in a way because I can try and pretend to be humble that's being proud in just the same sort of way
I find it a very difficult thing to avoid, pride
Tell me, are you interested in politics at all?
Not as much as I was
I am about the only socialist in my village and I go into the pub and sort of expect to stand up and defend all socialist policies sort of, this is the village socialist no, village idiot, sorry you agree with all this immigration so I stand up and defend it and it's awfully hard work though
I think I'm going to give that up
So where do you stand politically now then?
I'm still socialist but not as energetically as I was I suppose
What do you think about the way
England's being run at the moment?
Well...
I'm glad the socialist's are in power because
This illusive thing called freedom is sort of rearing its head and the conservatives are pushing it forward and I thought this argument was smashed at the early years of this century but it seems to be coming back and it really is exceptionally dangerous because the more you try and defend freedom you allow everybody to do exactly what they like within limits then the less you have
I mean there's no freedom in living in a slum
It's alright you can say the chap can do whatever he wants he can get a better job or anything but that's just not the case the more you defend freedom the less you have it
Well my girlfriend is in Africa and I don't think I'll have another chance of seeing her again
Have you got any girlfriends?
No, not yet
I'm sure it will come, but not yet
What is your attitude to sex?
Well it's not quite, normal attitude to anti-sex
I mean I as it were burnt my fingers a little
I don't feel as though I'm missing anything now
I don't feel a need for it and I'm quite happy at not feeling a need for it really
I mean I do think a lot of people think too much about it
What happened when you burnt your fingers?
I'd rather not talk about it really well no in fact I don't really mean that
I don't mean I don't want to talk about it it's just I'd need quite a long time to think about it really
Why?
Well in the end I decided the eh... the effect, the pleasure, or... just didn't seem worth it really didn't seem worth...
See I think there's two different sorts there's casual sex then there's sex in love and marriage and casual seks is not...
I don't think it's quite as widespread as people believed because if both the people treat it as casual sex then I think it's alright but if you're sort of looking for
I don't know this may seem awfully silly but if you're looking for casual sex but don't want to treat it as such then it doesn't seem to be worth the lies, I don't know the... the sort of effort
- Is this what happened to you?
- I suppose in a way yes
Have you been in love?
No, no and eh...
I think I'll probably have to wait for that really
Play international wrestling
Yeah that's only at summertime though
Yeah summer we can go on the grass
Neil went to a comprehensive school in Liverpool got four A-levels then walked out of Aberdeen university after one term and is now doing casual labour in London
I came to London I think because
I wanted to start a new life really
I'd left the university in Aberdeen in the end of nineteen seventy-five and I became conscious of the fact that I was drifting around which I suppose I'm still doing here but at least I took the decision to move myself and I think possibly there's more challenge in
London than there ever could be in Aberdeen
Peter, Neil's school friend from Liverpool is now in his last year at
London university, reading history
It was obviously a big step it was exciting more than anything,
I mean that sounds corny but it was
Do you remember the day you left Liverpool?
Yeah very well
It was pouring down with rain, I remember that just had the traditional send of from the train station, my mum and dad were there a couple of mates turned up at the last minute, from the school to see me
- Catch a girl and kiss a girl
- Yeah and what happens then?
- Well the girls are all screaming
- Yeah and then we catch them we kiss them
We're interested in contrast with you and Neil were you aware of differences in home background at the time?
Oh sure yeah, I mean both Neil's parents are teachers as you know that's got to be a hell of a difference for a start
I mean, I'm not knocking them for a minute, they're very nice people but eh... there's obviously going to be some sort of academic type atmosphere in the house which I did notice one or two times but I think Neil whether by design or just by the situation he was in was obviously going to be under more pressure
I came to London and I contacted an agency for squatters and they were able to give me the address of somebody who was able to help people who were looking for accommodation in the London area and by a process of chasing people around
I eventually managed to find this place here
I wouldn't squat in a place which
I knew to be owned by somebody else
I wouldn't, certainly because
I knew if I had a place of my own and found somebody squatting in it I'd be disgusted
But this place was empty and I was simply offered a place to live here and was very grateful for it and I think in questions of squatting a bit of humanity is more important that vain rules about who can live where
In contrast, Peter lives in a flat in North London sharing with three other students there have been three guys living here originally and one of them left to get engaged, virtually married and the flat was meant for four in the first place so Dave and Trev asked Ian and I if we'd like to move in because we did 'cause we'd been searching for a flat for some months so we jumped at the opportunity really
I've got my own room, I can cook whenever I like
I haven't got a landlady to tell me what time to come in
I've got my own front door key and to tell the truth it's a lot better than a lot of the accommodation I've had over the last eighteen months or so it could be a bit warmer, it's a bit chilly but eh... it's perfectly satisfactory for the time being
These are obvious restrictions, y'know not able to cook for yourself you've got to think for yourself a lot more but it's eh... certainly not as exhausting or wearing as I thought it would be
I mean, y'know... coming up myself is a challenge of some sort we're going to have to split two sausages into three now
Well once Caroline Tetford said she loved me and I'm going to marry her when I grow up
I hate her, she's always getting bad tempered and cross with me
- Does she?
- Yeah
She says "Neil Hughes, move your desk forward" and when I put it back she says
"Neil Hughes put your chair forward" and she just gets into a girly mood with me like that
Tell me about the period in your life when you went to university and what happened
It was a very short period
I was only at university... well I was only taking university seriously for a matter of two or three months maybe I went to the wrong university or maybe university life didn't suit me either way
I felt a very great need to get out of the system
Well this is my final year so
I'm not in college that much
I don't have to be so what I'm expected to do is to be ... laying out revision timetables at home and.. working like a slave which I'm not at the moment, but I will be soon
I did make an application to Oxford but I didn't get in and eh well I think that's in the past now and that's...
I don't know whether I would've been any happier at Oxford it always had been a dream to get into Oxford
I think being as people had encouraged me because I knew famous people having been to Oxford
I'd read memoirs written by famous people things such as Brideshead's Revisited which was a great favourite but these I suppose are well they were dreams which
I had while I was at school and
I have to just get over the fact that I didn't get into Oxford probably because I didn't approach the thing in the right way
Are you bitter about it?
I was very bitter at the time maybe I still am but
I try to get over it
I think once I can get myself going I can work solid, yeah but it's the motive which is very hard to acquire when you're in the flat most of the time it's hard to sort of look ahead to next June and think of those exams but I dare say I'll do it, get the average type degree and...
I'm not worried
Is it a problem to you motivating yourself generally?
Yeah it can be
I can look back on the day and think "how I wasted that" although I must've enjoyed it at the time
What sort of influence did your parents have on you?
Well they made me believe in god from the start which I certainly wouldn't or I don't know even now whether I believe in god or not
I've thought an awful lot about it actually and
I still don't know but still this was the absolutely certain one if one was to survive in the world one had to believe in god this was something which was taught to me always think of other people first before yourself to a ridiculous neurotic degree which I think affected me
What do you mean by that?
Well this I suppose is basic christianity it's sort of... if somebody slaps you on one cheek let them do it on the other almost literally taken which gave me a few shocks when I tried to put it into practise
- In what way?
- I don't think to be honest to go back to that question I don't think
I was really taught any sort of policy of living at all by my parents this was probably their biggest mistake that I was just left to fend for myself in a world which they seemed completely oblivious of and I found even when I tried to discuss problems which were facing me in school my parents didn't seem to be aware of the nature of the problem
Were they ambitious for you?
Yeah but along set lines which they had planned
I think they have often said to me that they they had seen me even from when I was very young in a certain type of career and possibly they'd never even thought that anything else was vaguely possible they probably imagined I would be maybe a university lecturer or a bank manager or something like this some kind of indoor work which involved writing and reading and this sort of thing because they didn't take account of the other side of my personality but
I wonder how many parents really think of their children as individual human beings
What are your feelings about them now? Your parents
I'm glad they're there because if I ever become homeless again
I will be able to go back and live with them they wouldn't object to this
I'm capable of getting on with my parents perfectly well
If they are willing to let me live as another adult in their house and appreciate that I'm living my own way of life and that I am living there because I can't think of anything else to do with myself
What do they think of what you're doing now?
They accept it, I think now they do accept that I'm the person I am they see this as simply my attempting to add more experience to my life which satisfies me
Are they worried about you?
Probably yes but no more worried now than they were when I first left for university that was probably the time at which they were most worried and we have in fact managed to discuss a lot of personal things which I felt at one time I'd never be able to discuss and therefore, as I say it is possible for me to live for a few weeks even a month or so at home without there being to much friction
So are you under pressure to get a job to think of what you're going to do when you leave in June
Yeah I suspect I am from my parents, they keep dropping hints which is only fair I can understand their feelings obviously I've got to get a job
I don't want to laze around on the dole for months and months you'd go mad
I just can't see what I'll be doing in nine, ten months time though
Does that depress you or does that excite you?
No it certainly doesn't depress me perhaps it does excite me in a way yes something will turn up, something of that nature y'know but obviously you've got to think realistically about doing something
I mean I might be living in cloud cuckoo land y'know my mum and dad might say "no son"
"you don't get a job you like"
I'd like to think I could
Well, we pretend we've got swords we make the noises of the swords fighting and when somebody stabs us we go "Arrrrrgghhh!"
What goes through your mind when you saw those two films when you were at seven, bright and perky?
I find it hard to believe that I was ever like that but there's the evidence
I wonder why I was like that
I wonder what it was inside me that made me like that and I can see even at fourteen and
I was beginning to get more subdued and I was putting a lot more thought into what I was saying too a ridiculous degree and probably when I was seven I just..... I don't know
I lived in a wonderful world where everything was sensation dumb
I could be happy like this I could be miserable the next minute and I didn't have to plan for the future
I didn't have to worry about having friends and all this money because everything was so mapped out for me
I don't know what sort of stumbling blocks should be put in a child's way to get him used to living in the outside world because I think maybe this is something that was wrong in my upbringing
I didn't have enough obstacles to get over, to toughen myself up against
I was unprepared for things as they were but looking back now I couldn't think of what might have been done and I certainly wouldn't start writing educational theory about this because I know how personal a thing it is and it probably wouldn't work in anybody else's case
Would you like to be seven again?
No because I'd know that I had to be twenty-one again
I moved up to a comprehensive school
I found it much bigger of course
I found it hard to settle into at first but now I've been here a few years I know my way around
I think it's a very good idea to have competition otherwise you might start to relax and not try hard enough
Yes at that age I was very conscious of having to struggle because I suppose of what parents and teachers were saying they were saying they said "you've got a brain you must put all your effort into school work" well what else could they have said?
I would've probably been just as angry, looking back if they'd never encouraged my intellectual efforts at all
When I get married I don't want to have any children because they are always doing naughty things and making the whole house untidy
Do you have any great ambition, any dream?
I suppose I... yes well...
I would like to be someone in a position of importance and I've always thought this but I don't think I'm the right sort of person to carry the responsibility for whatever it is
I've always thought well I'd love to be possibly even love to be in politics
Something like this but eh...
I suppose that I'd probably find just as tedious as all the other jobs I've done so...
What do you want out of life?
The satisfaction of knowing that I've left some sort of imprint rather than just lived out my life
I don't know.... it's going to sound like an epitaph
I've left in memory of some people y'know not that this guy worked, made a fair bit of money, good house, died
I'd like to have done something but... then again it must be a drop in the ocean I suppose
I mean who is going to remember me in a hundred years time?
So is it that important, how you live out your life? but I would like to think
I'm going to do something with it something positive
Do you and Peter have the same values?
I think we both value happiness and stability
I think most people do
But you've kicked against the stability that's..
I don't think I ever had any stability, to be quite honest
I can't think of any time in my life when I ever did
I don't think I've been kicking against anything
I think I've been kicking in mid-air the whole of my life
It's only one more
What do they think about each other? and how would they act together? to find out we invited them all to one big party and joined in
#If I say that I love you#
#and you know it's true#
#if you said that you'd leave me#
#what would I do?#
#I'll let you back if you let me#
#I'll change your mind......#
Yes but they were a bit too tough for my liking so they hit me right in the back and I've still got a pain there
The posh ones,
"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!" they're nuts you just have to touch them
Well some of them were rather dirty
- What do you think about them?
- I played with them quite naturally
I think they were rather nice really
What do you think about rich people?
Well... not much
Tell me about them
Well they think they can do everything without you doing it as well and they think just because they're rich they have to have people to do all their work
What would you do if you had lots of money, about two pounds?
Me? I would help the poor
What for?
The poor, if you don't help them they die soon wouldn't they and every time we have a harvest festival we send food to them and once these two.....no
Susan and Janet Simpson went round giving it out with Mr Floyd
- I don't think much of the accents
- Neither do I
Neither do I it won't prevent me liking them
Don't you ever think to yourself -
Jump out of that suit, come to the Eastend throw the books in the corner and do what you have to do
- I'd certainly throw the books in the corner
- Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yeah
- What are you going to do in life?
- I've really no idea
The idea of just living somewhere and working for a living is just horrifying really
I mean, being a student is very easy
I just postponed the decision by going to university
I wouldn't say being a student's easy, that's why I left school
- It was too hard
- Really
Who is to say what a seven year old child is?
I don't think there's anyway you can do it so a seven year old child could seem to be one thing and you could always argue that the end product was produced by what he actually was rather than what he seemed to be
- you'd normally use the total....
- Not a bookmaker but a....
- I'm always frightened they'd clear off
- What?
I'm always frightened they'd clear off if they had a bad afternoon
No they're not like that, they can always get hold of money
What fears do you have for the future?
Well certainly the idea of, as I was saying before getting into a job and simply getting stuck in it and that's it without knowing why you're doing it but I would think now that this is the time where I would think about something like that and make sure it doesn't happen
I really don't see how one's life can be a failure in that.... if I became a journalist and got sacked at thirty probably because I had grown out of it or I had changed so I was no longer suitable therefore I'd find something else which I enjoyed and which my talents were suited to
No I have never suffered at all never been driven to despair or tears or....
I don't know, have any of the others?
My strength is being able to keep going really and my weakness is not being able to take any positive course of action
I suppose I tend to behave in the fashion of the people that I'm with in some circumstances I think that can be quite a weakness sometimes sometimes wish I didn't occasionally look at myself and think "christ you're a bloody fool, what are you doing now?" and that sometimes disturbs me
We had a teacher at school that his favourite ploy was....
"All you girls want to do is walk out, get married, have babies and push a pram down the road with a cigarette hanging out the side of your mouth" god if there was ever a sentence
I'd resent it would be that one - yeah
There's only one ambition really I want a baby son if I see my baby son that'll be my ambition fulfilled no one knows that, only you now!
Well to me it is a dream to be totally happy
I mean, I don't think you can expect that but...
What happens if you don't make that?
If you don't ever find it? How will you cope?
I don't know, it would be hard to say the human minds very strong and it can be very weak and so you could crack up from it and you could just live your life out from day to day and you could get over it I think well not get over it but you'd sort of cope with it I think but what I'd do
I just don't know
I mean I want to be happy and my dreams are all for happiness but basically that's what
I want out of life
I always leave something inside me, I always leave a bit behind
I always hold back a bit with everything I do just to sort of....something to fall back on
I've always got something else to look on if anything goes wrong anywhere
What is that something you hold back?
I think it's a part of my heart
What do you want most out of life?
To be happy and get on with life you don't want to just sit back and let it always pass you could be run over by a bus tomorrow so you've got to make the most of it while you've got it
Simply to be able to wake up in the morning and feel that this day was going to be worthwhile which is what I don't feel at the moment
At the end of their very special day in London after their trip to the zoo and the party we took our children to an adventure playground where they could do just what they liked those from a children's home set about building a house
The houses in Australia, the average sort of living there will do me fine
I mean it's terrific
I often say I'm saving to settle down with Yvonne and then I think to myself "nah
I might buy a car instead"
There's Nicholas
You have to run fast to stay where you are to go forward you have to run very fast indeed, or whatever the quote is so I'll probably feel I'm actually achieving nothing and Tony
I don't want to change because if I change it proves the other Tony
Walker was all fake
Andrew
After I've qualified as a
Solicitor I'll have to rethink
I don't know at all what will happen after that and Bruce
It all springs from..... loving god and christ I suppose you try and do that as best as possible and that leads your actions in life
John
I'd quite like to go into politics but that's easier said than done
Susie
When you're a child you always think how nice it would be to be grown up and independent and things but there are times when
I wish I was three again
Jackie and her friends give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man this has been a glimpse of Britain's future
All men are sincere, but they have many kinds of sincerity.
AND NOW MY LOVE
...would like to thank the following actors and technicians for their commitment in the making of his film...
What's that?
A machine that reinvents life.
What's it called?
The Lumière cinematograph.
Would you like to try it?
Put your hand here.
You're as lovely as the new century.
You have a fine sense of rhythm.
I like doing this.
It's a promising career.
Even for women.
Do you live in Paris?
You're beautiful.
Has anyone ever told you that?
Has anyone told you that you're beautiful?
Yes, you've been told before.
44 rue d'Assas, 8:30 PM.
But, sir!
Don't insist.
It's a boy!
Thank you.
Bravo!
We won, we won!
Bravo!
One, two, three!
- My mother.
- She's beautiful.
My father.
I'm...
David Goldman.
Rachel Stern.
Pleased to meet you.
So?
It's a little girl.
How's the mother?
Here's to Sarah's fifth birthday!
Here's to Israel's third anniversary.
Blow out the candles, honey.
- Bravo!
- That's good!
Want to tell a story, Maurice?
Bravo, you're a real success.
I should have done like you after the war and gone into the shoe business.
It's my revenge on the war, on racism.
You're still a real success, you know.
Here's my real success!
I propose a toast to Mama's health!
- Mommy, I'chaim!
- L'chaim.
To Sarah's 10th birthday!
To Israel's eigth anniversary!
Blow out the candles!
That's for you.
Are you happy?
When she's 16, she'll get a big horse.
How much is he costing you?
Multiply 100000 volts by 10.
You spoil her.
She wanted Bécaud for her 16th birthday, so I got her Bécaud!
When she's 20, she may ask for Moshe Dayan.
At 20, Dayan will ask for her.
She looks so much like her mother.
Looking at her, every day,
I'm still in love with my wife.
You think it's smart to spoil her so much?
I gave her 16 happy years; whatever one can get, I got for her.
As for her future... a wall is being built in Berlin, missile sites in Cuba.
There's a war in Algeria.
So the future...
- How much?
No discount?
It's my birthday.
Are you kidding?
Do you have his latest recording at the Olympia?
Let me see.
You kiss very well for your age.
- You think so?
- Hmm.
Ever hear of playing with fire?
I yearn to burn.
Rich brat!
Why do you have an accent?
Too much Swiss chocolate!
- No, but really?
- I was raised in Switzerland.
- I understand, but...
- The German part of Switzerland.
Yes, but still...
My father survived the war because he spoke German.
So he thinks speaking German is the safest thing a Jew can do.
If you're anti-Semitic,
I can shut up.
I'm not anti-Semitic.
I'm ashamed.
Ashamed of what?
It's okay to feel ashamed.
Shame is part of the pleasure.
- Are you a virgin?
- No... yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yes... no, no... yes!
- Yes, no, yes, no? !
- Really?
- Hmm.
Be careful, I fall in love easily.
Neither do I.
But why me?
Why not some nice young...
Swiss chocolate?
- Why me?
- I prefer 30-year-old men.
- You really are spoiled rotten.
- Oh yes!
- Oh yes!
- Oh yes!
Yes, they are not bad, not bad.
But there's another pair
I'd like to show you.
That dark brown pair.
Thank you.
Can't even pee for free!
You might at least keep the toilets clean.
- What do you mean?
- Go and see for yourself.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SPRINGTIME
It will all come back to you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you...
We're going on vacation tomorrow.
At what time?
Depends on the weather, and other things.
BETTER RICH AND HEALTHY
THAN POOR AND SICK.
- This must be the place.
- Yes.
You've got good taste.
And you like nice things.
TV sets and records, cameras and radios.
Think you'll like prison?
Prison?
For such petty things!
You're right... such petty things.
Couldn't you have stolen an elevator instead?
If I'd known you were coming...
Next time, think about it.
Gentlemen, you are trying to judge a poor man... with rich men's justice.
You may be eloquent but you are late.
Do not punish poverty.
Poverty is its own worst punishment.
Do not punish youth.
This youth... this youth, which... which your bourgeois poets have called,
"The best years of our lives."
But for this 20-year-old here before you, what does that pretty phrase mean?
What does the word
"youth" mean to him?
He has had no youth.
His 20-year existence can be quickly summarized:
Parents unknown, which put him in an orphanage for 14 years.
Then, four years in a reform school.
Reform school!
And do I know about that!
And two years in Algeria.
Two years in Algeria!
Your Honor, you can't put him back in jail.
- Two years in Algeria.
- Don't bring up Algeria.
Why? Because he deserted, you'll say.
- Here, drink some...
- I don't have time.
You tell me he betrayed his country.
But I ask you,
I ask you, which country?
Do you mean the territory stolen from the Algerians...
You need a haircut.
...and which we call, with beautiful hypocrisy...
French Algeria!
Must you insist?
It may hurt his case...
Yes, I must insist, gentlemen!
Right now, in 1961, at a time when Ben Barka is assassinated.
Remember mother is coming to dinner...
Yes, I remember.
Now, where was I?
At a time when the Secret Army Organization unmasks the true face of this colonial war, right?
A Frenchman's sole duty...
- listen to me!
- Hurry up.
Wait!
A Frenchman's sole duty...
- is to be a deserter!
- There you are.
Take your coat!
Aren't you overdoing it a bit?
He's just up for theft.
Why did Simon Duroc refuse to fight in Algeria, then?
He refused because he didn't want to be a watchdog in a stolen country.
Yet you would have me believe this man is a thief?
That's not bad.
Leave it in.
The real thieves are the bosses.
The bosses who, in the name of the profit margin, rob their workers... with a clear conscience!
That's good.
Keep it.
I have to memorize it.
"Real thieves are bosses who, in the name of profit, rob their workers..."
Therefore, this court denies bail to Mr. Simon Duroc, and finds him guilty of multiple thefts and larceny, under Articles 379 and 38 of the Penal Code.
The defendant is sentenced to two years in prison.
Court is adjourned.
I knew the judge was a jerk.
I'd better get used to jerks.
- That's so true.
- Especially jerks like you.
Just like I said.
MARILYN HAD BEEN SICK
FOR A LONG TIME
What are you doing here?
It's not your birthday.
What are you doing here?
Being rich doesn't give you the right to bug people.
Listen, you wanted Bécaud, you got Bécaud.
We had a good time, you were nice and everything,
- but get out of my life, now.
- I love you, Gilbert.
Loving people like me is easy.
It's easy!
Loving people like me is easy.
It's easy!
In 10 or 20 years, historians will decide which events of this year '62 were of greatest importance.
There is no doubt that the first American in space, on February 20, was a milestone in space exploration.
And withdrawal of Russian missiles from Cuba, or Algerian Independence ratified by the Evian Summit on March 18, delayed the prospect of any war.
But in some way, without going against all the major historical events of this year,
Marilyn Monroe's suicide on that August 4th evening, is a major event of the year '62.
Marilyn's death is not only the tragic end of a star, or of the Hollywood movie industry.
It's also the end of a certain society whose happiness was based on materialism.
Tonight at 7:00 PM, George Leroy will discuss what this death represents amid the despair present in the works of The Beat Generation, such as Bob Dylan,
Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.
For now, here is a newsbreak of a different kind:
An unusual escape from the Santé Prison.
The inmate took advantage of trash collection, got in the back of the garbage truck and left the prison with ease, unarmed, unassisted and without any rope. Well done!
And now we would like to return to Marilyn.
Let's listen to one of her records, which I am sure will move our audience.
Here is the voice of Marilyn.
She tried to kill herself over you!
So I spoiled her.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Bécaud, that's nice!
- She didn't really want to die.
- What do you mean she didn't?
She wanted to show you that she is her own person.
Anyway, it's attempted suicide at 16, narcotics at 20 and marriage at 25.
- Then you can relax.
- Sure, then I can relax!
Did you commit suicide at 20?
Did I take drugs when I was 16?
- We weren't normal.
- Ah, we weren't normal!
- In there?
- That's it.
If you want to distract her, take her on a nice trip.
You'll see the trip
I'll take her on!
- Don't get upset.
- Who's upset?
You shouldn't take men so seriously, you know.
You have to laugh, you must laugh!
Life has to be lived, not destroyed!
You thought you could be a smart ass?
Do me a favor.
Stop thinking about this guy.
Look how beautiful this town is.
You know that beauty is meant to be shared with someone.
I suppose I'm nobody?
Visiting a museum alone is such bullshit!
Who taught you such language?
- And you're not alone!
- You're always with your memories.
Look at how beautiful it is.
When did you come here with Mom?
In 1946.
We were expecting you.
- Which thigh?
- A wing!
One and one makes two wings.
Here, now if you can't fly away with that...
In restaurants, they always serve the right thigh.
Chickens sleep on their left leg.
It's tougher, harder.
The right one is more tender.
I never thought of that.
- Right or left?
- Right!
This is where the elite meet to eat.
It's fit for a king, boys.
Bon appetit!
So, in a restaurant,
I always ask for the right thigh?
They look terrified.
You cannot judge them.
You belong to a wasteful society.
Theirs is one of sacrifices.
I'm beginning to think you're a communist.
How could I approve of dictatorship?
It's what killed your mother.
And yet, dictatorship would be the ideal if dictators really were the most intelligent people.
Instead, the most intelligent people are all against it.
Eat your caviar, it's not expensive here.
I don't like caviar.
Go ahead, sir.
Do you speak French?
A little. Merci.
I was saying that for us, caviar here is not really expensive.
Will you stop thinking about that man?
I'm not. I'm thinking about the next one.
What's he going to be like?
That's not so easy... part gangster, part gentleman; not too handsome or too ugly; a man who's not afraid of men.
Eat.
Drink.
Again.
Been training him long?
Ever since I came to these superb kitchens.
One chicken-and-fries day,
I saved his life.
We've been inseparable ever since. Right, Julien?
So you saved his life on a chicken-and-fries day?
You always put three sugar cubes in your coffee?
Always. Why?
If you meet a girl who puts three cubes in her coffee, marry her!
She's your soulmate.
Clear the table!
- I don't like China.
- Hong Kong isn't China.
- It's China's brothel!
- Then let's go to China.
Why not to the moon?
Some day that may be easier than getting to Peking.
You think men are that selfish?
Worse!
That's why capitalism works.
Because it's a selfish invention.
So, if I meet a woman who puts three sugar cubes in her coffee, you swear she'll be my soulmate?
That's really disgusting!
At least you'll have one thing in common.
Mao will be the greatest dictatorship in history... one man ruling
700 million people.
This damn tour bugs me enough, but having to listen to your reactionary ideas...
Reactionary?
Sorry.
Why reactionary?
700 million Chinese, all Maoists!
- Isn't it a dictatorship?
- Reactionary and fascist!
You're a dirty Jew!
Come on, tell me why you're here.
For bottling cheap Beaujolais as vintage Bordeaux.
- Get it?
- In mass quantity? !
I remember it very well.
One night you told some friends,
"I'm sure the Chinese are happy."
No! What I said was,
"Mao's triumph is that he's convinced
700 millions Chinese that they're happy."
You missed the nuance.
But I am sure that one man in China is happy. Mao!
The man I love isn't Chinese.
I know, he's a singer.
Mass at 8:00.
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.
Then why are you in jail?
Because God doesn't believe in me.
But you still believe in Him?
Faith is an advance drawn on happiness.
Do you deserve your 10-year sentence?
I'd say I got off cheap.
Eat! Eat!
What is an American?
He's a Jew chased out of Russia, an Irish Protestant who escaped from the Catholics, a Sicilian gangster who escaped from the cops, a German filmmaker who escaped from the Nazis.
There is nothing better than a country full of outcasts, of persecuted refugees and hunted men.
They are the ones who invented capitalism.
To carve a country out of a wilderness, they had to invent a system for adventurers.
The trouble is that today, they are only the sons and grandsons of the original gangsters.
They received an inheritance that they probably didn't deserve.
The sons of the Mafia can't match their fathers.
Buffalo Bill's son couldn't shoot as well as he did.
The sons of the Mafia can't match their fathers.
Buffalo Bill's son couldn't shoot as well as he did.
That's what I've been told.
Inheritance undermines capitalism.
It may be a fatal flaw.
Through the generations, it makes accountants out of adventurers.
Inheritance is your problem too, you spoiled brat.
When I die, how will you protect my assets?
That was a very beautiful speech, but the man I love isn't American, so...
"He isn't American, so..."
- Where did you get that accent?
- It's Jewish.
You mean I speak like that?
- I didn't say you did.
- So what?
Stop getting mad all the time.
But I'm not mad, but now you are.
Now it's your turn.
- Give me a kiss.
- No.
Then don't give me a kiss.
Eat! Wipe yourself! Eat!
Wipe yourself three times.
Three times,
I said!
Add two more times.
Once more, let's go!
There's still a piece left.
Wipe yourself first, then go for it.
Another little piece!
Julian's ready for America.
Ah, America!
A land of free men.
A free man is one who makes his own decisions, all alone, in the crapper in the morning.
Do you know America?
It's our country, boy!
A fantastic country.
If gangsterism could choose a home, it would be America.
It's the Promised Land of the gangsters in the world, of the whole international Mafia.
Eat! Wipe yourself!
Three times.
Add two more to that.
One more. Do it! Good.
200 million Americans, all delinquents.
That's a great country!
Maybe it was the best way for him to go.
Death before disenchantment.
Now he'll be called a great man.
He'll be a hero, a god, an idol!
There's a Persian saying that goes,
"If you want to be truly appreciated, die, or go on a trip."
I wanted to die.
But you saved me.
- I wonder if you did right.
- Yes, I did right indeed.
She'll never find another man like him.
Who knows?
Maybe he was a great president but a lousy lover.
Think I'll ever find another man?
Yes. People always forget.
Why didn't you ever find another woman in 15 years?
I did find her.
It's you.
The Commies did it.
She was the wife of a great man.
Now she's the widow of a god.
And you only meet God once.
Whatever you say,
I admire the guy who shot him.
Big deal, in Texas, every guy owns a rifle.
At least he died at the top.
No disenchantment now.
"Better to live
10 years as a lion than 35 years as a sheep."
- Did you make that up?
- Mussolini did.
Too bad.
For $10000,
I'd knock off De Gaulle.
I bet the guy in Texas got more.
$10000 is fine.
...destination of Amsterdam, and the flight for Helsinki...
I'm bored, Daddy.
When are we going back home?
This trip didn't teach you anything?
Yes! That I love Gilbert.
Can't you think about some other man?
I'm not going to find another man amongst elephants.
When are we going home?
When you'll choose life over a man.
I'll always choose the man.
Isn't this better than the Paris Zoo?
The Paris Zoo is 10 minutes from Gilbert.
And to hell with Africa!
The man I love isn't an elephant.
I'm sick of luxury hotels, heated pools, caviar, champagne, planes!
- When are we going home?
- Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night we'll be in Israel.
Churchill, even money.
Big Charles, even money.
Churchill, two-to-one.
Big Charles, three-to-one.
Three lumps of sugar in your coffee?
- That's nothing new.
- It's nothing new, but don't come crying to me, saying you're getting fat!
You'll see, Jerusalem is the only city in the world that proves God exists.
Which God?
Jewish or Arab?
All Gods exist in Jerusalem...
Jewish, Muslim, Christian.
Jerusalem is the United Nations of all religions.
The United Nations of all religions...
1,000 square meters of cathedrals and synagogues, temples and mosques.
25 nations are represented, but only one language... prayer.
God inhabits every square inch of Jerusalem... every speck of dust, every stone, every wall.
That's why God can be a wall in Jerusalem.
Know what I think?
Maybe the world of gods is like the world of men.
Maybe once in a while up there, they hold elections.
Sometimes it's a Catholic God, sometimes a Protestant God, or some other one who takes power.
For 10 years, or a century, that God dominates all the others Gods.
One God is a blessing, another is a curse.
One is a Gandhi, another is a Hitler.
In the concentration camps, did you believe in God?
I don't know.
You can be an atheist for a week or a year, or for the duration of a war, but you can't be an atheist all your life, really.
In fact, beware of atheists.
If the sun and sea can't make them believe in God, they'll never ever believe in anything, not even in you.
Anyway, that's not the problem.
Gilbert believes in God.
- He believes in God, right.
- Yes.
He believes in God, but not in you.
If he doesn't believe in you, he doesn't believe in God.
Are you still bored?
We should never see the people we used to love.
For an hour now,
I've been thinking about Rio,
New York and Venice.
Do you like it?
I'm setting up a business in Rome.
- Want to handle it?
- Are you kidding?
What's your sign?
Scorpio.
You'll get along with Aquarius.
- Are you Aquarius?
- No, Gemini.
So much for that.
On October 15, 1964, a Tass news bulletin surprised the world.
For reasons of sagacity and health,
Comrade Nikita Khrushchev submitted his resignation.
He was replaced by Brezhnev and Kosygin.
Overnight,
Khrushchev was denounced as the USSR's worst mistake since Stalin.
Stalin was denounced by Khrushchev 10 years ago.
10 years from now, in 1974, who will denounce
Brezhnev and Kosygin?
I only like men.
Me too.
Next.
Next!
Charles, here's your replacement.
- Hi. You know about photography?
- Yes.
He's all yours.
How much do you know about photography?
- Nothing.
- Next!
Then why the hell are you here?
I was sick of pots and pans.
- You're a smartass, aren't you?
- A little.
You an artist?
- Artist...
- Next.
I'll show you when I'm finished.
It's an automatic?
I said I'll show you when I'm finished!
Next.
Looks easier than pots and pans.
- Are you making fun of me?
- No.
Blacks prefer Blacks.
Arabs prefer Arabs.
The blind prefer the blind.
We all belong to some group.
We're the same race.
We could add up our despair, then.
Maybe not, but at least we'll understand each other.
Everyone is looking for someone who understands.
- Dykes!
- Stupid bastards!
They could have been nice to us.
How long have you liked women?
How about you?
How long have you liked women?
Whenever I break up with a man.
- What's your sign?
- Aquarius.
You're compatible with Scorpio.
Are you Scorpio?
No.
Beautiful!
- Who's paying?
- She is.
Then you rinse and dry, cut and file.
Get it?
That's terrific.
I'm asking you if you get it.
Is photography always like this?
Yes, you rinse and dry, cut and file, but don't touch!
A photo is meant to be looked at.
- Here!
- It sure beats the kitchen.
If you prefer this to the kitchen, when you get out, come see me.
Ask for Charlie the loupe.
- Charlie what?
- Charlie the loupe.
Loupe on the photo... loupe photo, imbecile!
"Loupe on the photo"!
It's fantastic.
- You rinse.
- Yes.
- I dry.
- You dry.
- I cut.
- I cut and I file.
And I file.
Understood?
I understand.
Same thing for all photos?
Always.
That's enough.
Your business in Rome doesn't need me.
- And I don't need it either.
- Another whim?
Listen, Daddy, since I was born, money has always been our only inspiration.
Now that we are loaded, nothing inspires me.
You should take a five-minute stroll every day in a hospital every day.
That should inspire you.
- You and your platitudes!
- That's not very nice.
I have enough worries right now.
"Worries are the dividends of success," you said.
Yes, I said that.
It's time you found the right man.
If he exists, he's taken.
Hi!
Good morning, sir.
See you tonight.
We'll have dinner.
Remember that the right man isn't a woman.
Good God!
An artist type in a fleabag hotel.
She'd only go to the best hotels with me.
The decor only matters when you're married.
- Who's he?
- My partner.
- You're a couple of punks!
- Yes, sir.
- At your service, sir.
- Yours faithfully.
These pictures will not only get you your divorce, but afterwards, she'll do the same things to you.
It's a little late.
- Eroticism comes after divorce.
- Exactly.
Couldn't you get me some movies instead of photos?
These look like they've been retouched.
No, sir. We only do photos, no movies.
Did she go pee?
- Excuse me?
- Did she go pee?
- Who?
- The little girl.
- Yes.
- She's beautiful.
- My daughter, you mean...
- She's very beautiful.
- She's yours?
- Yes.
Can you give me one like her?
- What?
- Can you give me one like her?
- A little girl?
- Yes.
You and I?
That's a good one!
If I understand... you came over and you said,
"Your daughter is beautiful"... you want to have a daughter like her with me?
If you don't mind.
Movies are something else!
Know what we're doing?
Making a porno.
Why are you stopping?
He's tired, he's faking it.
Why not make a porno?
A movie camera is amazing.
We could make nice pornos.
I wanted to know if it worked.
That's my problem now, not yours.
Good bye and thank you.
Wait a minute, here's my address.
Well, he's on the hook.
- Do we let him go?
- No. Teach him a lesson.
Yeah. Blow his mind.
- Yeah.
- Abby?
Are you game?
Why not?
Aghh!
Hello, little green friend.
Gently there.
- I won't hurt you.
- Tom, what are you doing?
Tom! Are you all right?
Tom, you're not human!
I'm sorry, but...
But sometimes i just don't understand you!
One minute you want to make love to me, the next you don't even notice I'm there!
Sometimes you scare me.
It's not me that scares you.
It's the world.
Let's get out of it, Abby.
Let's cross over.
Cross over?
- To the other side.
- How do we do that?
We kill ourselves.
- Oh, tom. Not that again.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, but I can't.
- Why not?
Well, I promised...
I promised my mother I'd help her go shopping in the morning.
Besides...
We'd miss all this.
But we'll come back.
It'll be even better.
You mustn't cry, mummy.
No, darling.
I'm sorry. I'll try.
I'm happy here.
I miss you all, of course.
But, mummy, you mustn't be sad for me.
It's so lovely.
I couldn't be happier.
May we ask her...
Over 100 years old.
Maximus leopardus, isn't it?
Yes, the tree-climbing variety.
So very rare now.
They're usually only found in graveyards.
That's right.
Anyone taking a Maximus leopardus from a graveyard is either foolhardy or ignorant.
You're always saying I'm foolhardy.
But I'm not ignorant, shadwell.
Except about certain things.
Three things. So answer me.
Why did my father die in that locked room?
Why do you never get any older, shadwell?
And what is the secret of the living dead?
Why do you ask me these questions?
You have already decided to force an answer out of your mother tonight.
I have to go now.
- Goodbye, mummy.
- Bye, darling.
- Daddy.
- Goodbye, susie.
- Granny.
- Goodbye, lovely.
- Grandfather.
- Goodbye, baby.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Goodbye.
- Mrs latham?
- Are you all right, mrs latham?
Do you mind?
Rest now.
Now... relax and start to breathe deeply.
Rest.
You're going to go into a nice deep sleep.
A deep, deep sleep.
Wasn't she wonderful?
Do you think we can go orjust wait?
I'll speak to him.
I, er, understand that mrs latham never accepts any payment.
No, we're only servants of a greater power.
- There's a present we'd like her to have.
- No, thank you.
It's been in our family for generations.
- No, thank you.
- Please!
- No!
- I insist.
- You must take it.
- Get out! Get out! All of you!
- I'm sorry if I'm upsetting you.
- Get out!
In you go, little green friend.
Hello, darling.
Good evening, mother.
I hear it went very well tonight.
Yes, it did. All except for one thing.
I had a telephone call from the police.
The word, mother, is fuzz.
I don't know what you and your gang of delinquents have been up to, but if you get into any more trouble, you're going to be arrested.
The word, mother, is busted.
Oh, tom. Tom!
You're up to something, aren't you?
Everybody dies, don't they?
But some come back.
Isn't that so?
You tried to get into the locked room today, didn't you?
How do the dead come back, mother?
What's the secret?
Oh, tom, don't go on with this.
You don't know enough.
That room's been locked for 18 years.
And my father's been dead for 18 years.
You know why the fuzz called, mother?
We blew a fellow's mind.
It was beautiful.
Should've been there.
He went right through the windscreen.
It was great fun.
But just you wait till you hear what we've got planned for tomorrow night.
You're threatening me, aren't you?
You want me to behave, mother?
Then give me the secret.
I think we should give him the key.
We can't.
That room could destroy him.
Not with this protection.
- Will the room give me the secret?
- It may.
It depends on you.
On what you are.
If you're afraid, we won't think any less of you.
I'm not chickening out, shadwell.
Shadwell!
Mother!
Oh! My poor boy!
Pulse is a bit slow, but that's quite usual in shock.
Oh, no.
His father's glasses.
If only he'd had more courage.
If he'd had more courage, he'd be with you now.
I warned him.
I said, "Charles, don't try.
"Don't cross over.
"You haven't got the faith to come back."
At the last moment, he must've had doubts.
I said, "when you die,
"you've got to believe that you're going to come back.
"You've got to believe that with all your being."
Thank you, mother.
Thank you very much.
- What do we do now, then?
- I don't know.
What's the fastest anybody's done on the motorway?
- And then you woke up!
You must be dreaming, out of your cotton-picking mind!
Today we do the ton.
- And hold it.
- But that's suicide.
So?
Well, hell, you've gotta go some time.
Which way, tom?
Through the town first, I think.
What are you doing?
' - Oh!
Get out!
Fred!
Hey, it's terrible weather.
Timber!
Ice cream? Cornet?
On!
Down there, constable!
Constable, what are you gonna do about my...
Come on, get out of here!
Whey-hey!
Aghh!
Ohh.
Tom, you'll kill yourself!
I'll try. Off the bridge!
Tom, please, don't!
I'll going! See you around!
Oh, look!
- I'm Abby holman.
- Mrs latham is expecting you.
Miss Abby holman, madam.
So you're tom's girlfriend.
I hope you didn't mind my asking to see you.
Won't you sit down?
You're not at all what I... expected.
I mean, you're... you're wearing a dress.
You're probably wondering why I came here.
You were with him when it happened, weren't you?
Yes.
Tell me...
Was it an accident?
Don't you know or...
Or don't you want to tell me?
It wasn't an accident.
He killed himself.
Yes.
Mrs latham, why would tom want to kill himself?
- Sherry?
- No, thank you.
Thank you, shadwell.
Now, what did you want to see me about,
Abby?
Well, this may sound strange, but we'd like to bury tom in our own way.
- What do you think, shadwell?
- Well, it's a little unusual, madam.
But I think it's what tom would've wanted.
Very well.
Where will you bury him?
- Down at the seven witches.
- Oh. Good.
You know the legend?
Yes, erm, witches were supposed to have been turned into stone, weren't they?
Yes. You see, they broke a bargain that they'd made with superior powers.
They had to be punished.
Good day, miss holman.
He's coming back, isn't he?
Yes.
Do you want him back?
Yes, god help me, I do.

He works for tom's mother.
Excellent.
- I want to bury this with tom.
- What's in it?
- Thank you.
- Ls that all?

I'll have to go back to the garage.
Cut across the seven witches, it'll save you ten minutes.
You're not afraid, are you?
No, please!
Right, that'll be 66.
Now, look,
I'm sick of you ton-up boys trying that trick on me.
Now, you pay up or else.
What are you gonna do, kill me?
I'll teach you a lesson, you long-haired git!
I don't have to take that sort of talk any more. Not from anybody.
- You got a phone?
- Yeah. We sell beer, too.
Ok. I'll try a pint.
- Where's the phone, then?
- Round the corner.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Got any change for the phone?
- Help yourself, love.
- Why did you do that?
- I'm just buying a ride on his bike.
Shadwell, i don't want to see anyone tonight.
Very good, madam.
Latham manor. Shadwell here.
Hello, shadwell.
Good evening, tom.
- 'I made it, shadwell.'
- We all knew you would.
'How does it feel to be back?' splendid. Enjoying every minute.
'Ls my mother there?'
- hello, tom.
- Hello, darling.
How are you? Are you all right?
Well, I'm, er, dead, mother.
But apart from that, I couldn't be better.
Am I going to see you?
I've got one or two things
I'd like to do.
But I'll try and pop around some time.
Goodbye, mother.
- That'll be 16.
- This one's on the house.
I said 16, Sonny!
He's with me.
That's right. Yes.
Yes, well, thanks very much. Ta-ra, love.
Hey! I thought we were going somewhere.
No, I'm sorry, love,
I've gotta go somewhere special tonight.
Oh. I'm not classy enough, is that what you're saying?
No, I didn't mean that at all.
What about my money?
That was good enough for you.
Sure. And I'm very grateful.
It's just that i can't take you anywhere tonight.
I'm coming for a ride.
Look, I'm not going to argue.
Just be a good girl and get off the bike.
No. I'm staying.
You silly little fool!
For god's sake, get the police, quick!
Evening, inspector.
Sorry to interrupt your card game.
It's all right, sergeant.
I was losing anyway.
- Stand aside, please. Thank you.
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Who made the call?
- I... I did.
I told her not to go with him.
But she would.
- Go with who?
- One of that... bike gang.
The living dead, they call themselves.
That lot.
Did the fuzz come to your house last night, too?
Yeah.
Right, who the hell did it, then, eh?
Hatchet, where was you last night?
Why does everybody think it's me?
The police said one of us killed them and it wasn't me.
Yeah. Well, who did it, then. Eh?
I was playing at a gig last night.
- I was shacked up at a motel.
- Hinky?
Drop me out, i was watching telly all night.
Did any of you ask the fuzz what the killer looked like?
Well, I did.
They described tom.
Right down to his name tag.
Someone's dug him up!
Someone's dug him up and took his bike!
And pinched his clothes.
Yeah. And then did the killings.
Making it look like one of us!
Well, when we get him... l'll kill him!
Don't you know me, Abby?
Morning, hinky. Gash.
Chopped meat. Jane.
Bertram. Hatchet.
Look, tom latham's dead.
I'm the leader of this gang now.
Who are you?
I'm tom. I've come back.
Like I told you, Abby, it can be done.
And here I am to prove it.
Any of you could do it if you wanted to.
There's only one condition. You have to believe you're gonna come back.
Believe enough so that you really want to die.
That's all there is to it.
Maybe. But that doesn't prove you're tom latham, does it?
- Tom!
- And another thing.
You can only die once.
After that, nothing and nobody can harm you.
Oh, man, what are we waiting for?
The lord is my Shepherd, i shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
For thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou annoitest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever.
My wife would like a last look at our daughter.
Oh, yes, of course. If you please.
Whoo-hoo!
- Ok?
- Yeah, great!
Good afternoon, ladies!
Hey, look!
It's father Christmas!
Why don't you get out of it?
Nur-nur-nur-nur!
You stupid kids!
Stupid kids!
Teach him a lesson?
Get out of it!
Hello, Abby.
Tom! Ohh!
Oh, I missed you.
Jane and hinky, what happened to them?
Hinky isn't coming back.
At the last moment, he hesitated.
He didn't really wanna die.
Poor hinky. And Jane?
She's out there.
Tom, she's dead!
Of course!
Some of my best friends are dead.
Hey, look! No arms!
Well, you two must be having fun.
Come with us, Abby.
Supposing...
Supposing at the last moment i was frightened, like hinky.
I need you, Abby.
If I had you, I'd have everything.
If only I could believe that.
From the look of those skid marks, something must've forced him over.
Did you get anything out of the witnesses?
Yes, sir.
Exactly the same story from all of them.
Two motorcyclists jabbing at his tyre with a knife.
Any identification?
Yeah. The living dead again.
All right, they've had it this time.
This is a murder charge.
- Pull them all in!
- Right, sir.
Hm. Message from the station, inspector.
- Yes, sergeant?
- They've brought in all the gang.
- Right.
- Roger.
That's bloody odd.
Get after them!
- X-u-n...
- X-u-n...
- Y-g-j...
- Y-g-j...
5-7-g. No! Er, 6-7-g.
6-7-g.
It's the latham house.
Drive in.
Y- g-j...
6-7-g.
Check those registrations, please.
And give them priority.
But my son is dead, inspector.
Yes, I know.
But this is the only place those motorbikes could've gone.
Shadwell, have any of tom's friends been here?
No, madam.
- Is it important?
- Very.
It's murder.
What can I do to help you?
The thing is, mrs latham, an outbreak like this doesn't just happen.
There's always something behind it.
Now, ever since your son died...
- I'm sorry.
- Please go on.
First your son was killed.
The following night, someone wearing your son's clothes...
Murdered five people.
Three days later, two more of your son's gang died, a boy and a girl.
This afternoon, there was another killing.
Immediately after the girl's body disappeared from her coffin.
He must have...
Inspector, mrs latham has been under a great strain.
The girl means something to you, doesn't she, mrs latham?
You must warn her family.
They must have nothing to do with her.
Madam, you must rest.
Please tell them, inspector. Please.
If that girl comes back, they must have nothing to do with her!
It's evil!
Please tell them, inspector! Please!
Yes, yes, of course I will.
Now, don't worry.
I suppose everyone has their breaking point.
I'm sorry. I should've realised what a shock it's been.
Yes, it has.
Thank you.
We've, er... checked on the owners of those bikes, sir.
Well?
Well, they belong to tom latham and Jane pettibone, the young woman whose body disappeared this afternoon.
Pigs! Pigs! We're gonna kill ya!
Do you hear?
We're gonna out you to bits!
Oh, belt up, hatchet.
We're in enough trouble as it is.
But we ain't done nothing!
We're innocent!
It's a murder charge.
20 years, you know? Pick up two.
You're a fine lot.
Do you really think tom would let us take the rap?
Oh, what can he do? We're in jail.
- So?
- So what can he do?
When you come back, you can do anything, remember?
Who the hell's making all that noise?
What the hell do you think you're up to?
We've come to give ourselves up.
We've been naughty.
Yes, well, you're up to your neck in trouble now.
- Should I close the door?
- Yes, please, love.
Now, I'm booking you both for a breach of the peace.
Oh, that's terrible!
Which way to the cells?
Names.
- Yes.
- Please.
- Tom latham.
- And Jane pettibone.
Addresses.
Er, oh, care of the cemetery will find us.
Being funny isn't gonna help you, miss.
What the blazes?
- What's going on in here?
- They just rode in.
I wanna have a talk with you two.
Where did you get these machines?
- Tom.
- Well? Have you made up your mind yet?
Yes.
I'm coming with you.
- Oh. Oh!
- Sorry.
Thank you.
- Is that your bike?
- Yeah. Yeah. Do you like it?
- Bet it's fast.
- Would you like to...
Sorry. Gotta go.
Hey, constable!
That's my bike!
Is it now? Then come on down here!
Ok.
Out you go.
Go!
Go!
Hey, want this?
What?
Oh!
Oh!
Thank you.
Shadwell! Shadwell!
Oh, tom!
Tom! Tom. Where is he?
Frog!
Frog.
Who are you?
I'm a police inspector.
Then I'm alive.
Yes. You were lucky.
Why? Why should a young, pretty girl want to die?
Why should any of them want to kill themselves?
The others. Are they...
Yes. All of them.
You mind which one we start with?
No. It's all the same to me.
Three, is it?
No, sir, there's been another one.
Four?
Bloody work horse, that's what I am.
Come on, let's get started.
Come on, out you come.
All right?
All right, lift.
No marks of violence.
Probable cause of death, drowning.
Let's see if he's got any water in his lungs.
Yes, sir.
- Who the hell could that be?
- Why don't you go and find out?
Well, there's not much doubt about that.
It's for you, doctor.
Your wife. She says it's urgent.
Oh, blast!
Er, pour that into a beaker and stick a label on it, will you?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Are you deaf or something?
I'm sorry, my love, there's nothing I can do about it.
You'll just have to start without me.
Ok. Bye-bye.
- Hello?
- 'Abby holman, please.'
- who's calling, please?
- 'Her friend.'
I'm afraid miss holman died last night.
- She's dead, shadwell!
- You must be very happy.
Happy? She's made it, mother!
She's dead.
Oh, my god, that poor girl.
Cheer up!
This is the happiest day of my life!
What's the matter?
Mother?
What are you going to do now?
What are you all going to do next?
Oh, there's lots to be done.
For starters, do you know how many policemen there are?
And judges? Teachers?
Preachers? Do-gooders?
You mean the entire establishment?
Right. And if I run out of ideas, hatchet has a programme.
Oh, yes, there's lots to be done.
The reason I told them you were dead is that I want to set a trap.
With your help.
I'm so glad I didn't die.
It was very close.
Now, listen to me, Abby.
Whoever dug up tom latham's body and took Jane pettibone from her coffin also stole those four bodies from the morgue.
Now, they were all members from the same gang. Your gang.
You are the last of them.
If whoever they may be thinks that you are dead,
I'm certain they'll come for your body, too.
That's when we'll get them.
But I'm not dead.
I've announced that you are.
I want to take your body to the morgue and see what'll happen.
Now, will you do it?
Nothing will happen to you. I promise we'll take every possible precaution.
- Inspector?
- Uh-huh?
If you loved somebody but didn't want to see them any more, what would you do?
Would you meet them and tell them?
Or would you just go away?
Well, er...
It would be more honest to tell them to their face.
Yes.
Tom! Tom!
I've got to talk to you! Now!
Why? What's the hurry?
It can't wait!
Haven't you caught on yet?
We've got all the time there is!
All eternity!
Look out, Jean!
Come on!
It's easy to kill live people.
Watch this!
Oh! My baby!
Oh! My baby!
Well, what do we do now?
I've always fancied driving through a brick wall.
- How about you?
- Why not?
- Where are we going?
- My place.
I'll take the right wall, you take the left.
What happened?
- My back wheel skidded.
- Liar!
You're not dead.
That's what I was trying to tell you, tom.
I don't want to die.
I must stop him.
- You can't.
- I must.
You made a bargain. It was for all time.
I'm going to break that bargain.
I still want you, Abby.
I can't kill myself.
I won't let you go.
If we kill you, you can never come back.
But if you do it, we'll be together... forever.
I want to go on living.
No.
You've got three minutes to decide.
- Are you quite sure now?
- Yes.
And you know what you will become?
- Yes.
- And that it will be for all eternity?
Yes.
And that your son was part of our bargain and he will have to pay, too?
It was his own doing.
Time's up.
HEART OF GLASS
I look into the distance, to the end of the world.
Before the day is over, the end will come.
First, time will tumble, and then the earth.
The clouds will begin to race...
...the earth boils over, this is the sign.
This is the beginning of the end.
The world's edge begins to crumble...
...everything starts to collapse...
...tumbles, falls, crumbles and collapses.
I look into the cataract.
I feel an undertow, it draws me, it sucks me down.
I begin to fall...
...a vertigo seizes upon me.
Now I look at one spot in the tumbling waters.
I seek one spot on which my eyes can rest.
I become light, lighter, lighter.
Everything becomes light,
I fly upwards.
Out of the falling and the flying, a new land arises.
Like the submerged Atlantis, the earth rises out of the waters.
I see a new earth.
Come here, don't be afraid.
Come here, I said.
The Giant has eyes like mill-stones.
Fingers...
...like tree branches.
His nose is a boulder.
The village lives in fear.
Rup says he's seen a Giant.
The time of the Giants is coming back.
The Giant breaks the trees and slays our cattle...
...and tears out our guts if he sees us.
He is sucking out our brains.
Tell Rup there are no Giants.
Next time he should note the position of the sun.
The sun was low and the Giant was just a shadow of a dwarf.
If nothing changes, you think that's a blessing.
But I see a fire...
...and I see the glass factory.
And I'll tell you something else...
A liar will cross one of the bridges, a thief will cross the other.
Tomorrow you will be finished, Ascherl!
I'll sleep off my hangover on your corpse.
Innkeeper, bring Wudy another beer.
I'll sleep on your corpse.
Hias said that I'll sleep on your corpse.
Hias sees into the future.
Provided we sleep in the hay.
And I must fall down onto the threshing place first.
Then you must fall on me.
If you don't fall soft, you'll be dead, too.
Muhlbeck is dead and no one knows the secret of the Ruby Glass.
He knew how to write.
He could have easily written it down.
How the Ruby glass is made.
Have you ever written a word?
But Muhlbeck could have talked,
Muhlbeck could.
My God...
The second glass.
This splendor is now relinquished from the world.
Now what will protect me now from the Evil of the universe?
You wouldn't dare.
I would.
Father, have you seen Adalbert?
Naked in bed again.
Get dressed!
Glass has a fragile soul.
It is unstained.
A crack is the Ain; after the Ain, there is no sound.
Will the future see the necessary fall of the factories...
...just as we see the ruined fortress as a sign of inevitable change?
People say that Hias has seen...
...nettles springing out of the factories.
The lilac bushes...
...will pine for the company of men, they say.
The Ruby must save us.
Tear Muhlbeck's house down, look for the secret in every crevice.
Dig three feet into the earth...
...on which his house stood...
...for Muhlbeck could have buried his secret.
Bring me the green davenport that he gave to his mother, Anamirl!
The chaos of the stars makes my head ache.
The hat.
The cane.
The master does not want his breakfast now.
Ludmilla may wear her hair down today.
Yes, she may wear her hair down.
A favor for the servant.
Why are you screaming?
Father, glass-blower Gigl thinks he has the secret of the Ruby glass.
This is the day to stand up.
No, I'd sooner stay in my chair.
I feel as though my backbone had crumbled.
Your backbone is not soft.
You won't collapse like a heap of stones.
For twelve years you have been sitting in this chair.
For twelve years
I have shown you your shoes.
I'll have you carried, as usual.
Are you sure?
Is this really Ruby glass?
Yes.
Is this really Ruby glass?
That's supposed to be Ruby?
Another one.
No! No!
Should I leave this place?
Madness is rampant in the village.
The factory owner wants a new furnace, but there are no builders.
Suddenly,
I see a fire flowing in the brook...
...and the wind pushing the fire on.
I see the trees burning like matchsticks.
I see many people running up a hill.
Breathless, they stop at the top...
...and, paralyzed, they turn to stone, one beside the other.
A whole forest of stone.
Then it becomes dark and still.
Down below, everything has perished.
There is no man, no house, only some debris.
Yes, and then I see someone running on the road below...
...with a burning branch in his hand...
...crying: ""Am I really the last one, the only one left? ""
Adalbert.
Send for the herdsman Hias; that he may see the mystery of the Ruby glass.
Even if we must tear
Muhlbeck from his grave...
...so that Hias can read his brain.
How strange, a whole town made of glass...
...with people living in it.
How can people live in glass houses?
Here's the church made of glass.
Animals live in the church...
...all kinds of animals: hares, chickens, deer...
...birds, cows...
...but there are no people in the church.
The streets are deserted.
Everything is covered in snow.
Ludmilla.
Let it be; there is more to break today.
Leave the mansion.
The master could slip and end up sitting on your face.
Why the sniveling?
Better that the servant prays for us to find the secret of the Ruby.
So much will happen, Hias is outside.
Already?
He knew?
He didn't need a messenger?
Master, please send a hunter to slay the bear.
The bulls are frightened...
...and Sam and I can't promise that he won't kill a bull...
...or cause a stampede.
On the day of the bear, a bull will run as far as Mainz.
Muhlbeck is dead.
He has taken his secret with him.
Muhlbeck abandoned us, but you are to see the secret of the Ruby.
I don't know the ingredient.
You know it for ten florins.
Then you know it for a thousand.
Do you want our people to eat oatmeal bread again...
...that gives them headaches?
Then tell me the secret...
...so we can make Ruby glass again; you can become foreman.
And I will carry a millstone to Trier.
I've only come because of the hunter.
I want the Ruby again.
I want the red glass, understand?
I need a glass to contain my blood, or it will trickle away.
The sun is hurting me.
You will never see the sun again.
Rats will bite your ear lobes.
Wudy is dead.
No, Ascherl is the one who has been nabbed.
Hias predicted that the one underneath falls first.
And look, the other falls on top of him, he falls softly.
Wudy survived it.
Let's separate them.
The one whose arm falls first is the dead man.
Don't curse in the face of the dead.
Now we know.
What Hias foresees, happens.
Here I am.
It's Toni.
You buried our foreman, Muhlbeck, the week before last.
Now they do not know what to do.
Hias predicted it.
You know about the Ruby glass?
The Ruby is the master's malady.
The davenport is here.
Bring it in.
Bring it in.
I'm delighted with this letter.
Adalbert, give me the letter-opener.
We'll read this message.
Can he decipher that?
If a letter reaches someone with the words scattered around...
...it should make you think.
Are you going up to the woods again?
I do not need the flour now.
I see that I only get away when the snow lies.
I'll put it back, then.
Your Muhlbeck is dead...
They have taken away your davenport.
Yes, he always sat there.
When night falls, the faces will die.
By day the rain pours...
...yet the land is drying up.
You have been invited because you describe the Ruby so beautifully.
I cannot hear enough of it.
The land of the Ruby... my land.
And all the people... dance in the red glow...
...and live in it.
Their blood, their life, everything is in the glass.
In the red, in the color.
This land is the only one.
Everything is in this land and everything is Ruby.
Your prayer has worked a miracle.
For an hour,
I have known something I never knew.
I can sell my secret to all glassworks.
Break all you can.
I shall take ten loads of
Ruby glass to Mt. Arber...
...and thrown into the lake, so it is dyed red.
Adalbert, did you understand?
The lake is dyed red.
The glass for the lake must go this very day.
Take everything from the store.
And another thing.
Re-stuff the davenport and mend it...
...and take it to Anamirl with ten florins for compensation.
Tell her I no longer wish her dead Muhlbeck to go to the devil.
May he be surrounded by a host of angels.
I have it.
It is here.
Here.
And inside here...
...and here.
We all...
I have already sent for the Plossberg furnace builders.
The mistress will be surprised when she returns.
She will see nothing left standing.
Lunatic.
When she dismounts, she will fall into the mud.
And you'll be on a boat, puking.
Anything else?
- Will there be any free beer today?
- Yes.
The master is deranged.
And in the glassworks there's been Beelzebub.
He sent out ten men with racks of glass...
... but they were not so stupid as to throw valuable glass in the lake.
They will smuggle it over the border and sell it.
Ludmilla, go before he wants something from you.
Lumilla, make yourself beautiful; the master wants your company.
I must provide some music.
In the meadow there will be someone who can play the hurdy-gurdy.
But I will have to sing with it.
Harp-Tony is in the inn.
Tell him to come, it will be to his advantage.
Now you have a soft seat again.
The night is coming on slowly today.
It creeps into the village...
...and in the stables people softly cuddle with the animals.
In the factory they are working again against fear...
...but they know that their work is in vain.
I told them the factory will burn down in the night.
But, like sleep-walkers, people walk towards their doom.
Well, and then?
Then the little one starts a war...
...and the big one across the ocean extinguishes it.
Then you will not get a loaf for two hundred florins.
Then a strict master comes...
...who takes people's shirts and their skin with them.
After the War you think there will be Peace, but there will not be.
Drink up.
I miss Ascherl!
You should not have smothered him.
I miss Ascherl!
He should have been here today.
Can't you go out to him?
He cannot come inside.
Bring me some Ascherl!
Even if I believe all that you say,
I do not believe that.
Believe it or not, that is your affair.
I tell you what I see;
I do not know if it will happen.
And then?
The peasants will dress like towns people...
...and the towns people will be like apes.
Women will wear trousers and boots.
The peasants will stand in their dung heaps with polished boots.
The peasants will eat cakes and discuss politics.
Who will play for us?
I will play for these two.
Keep playing!
Keep going!
They all fight; there is war in every house.
No man will like another man.
The elegant and fine people will be murdered.
He who has smooth hands will be slain.
The peasants will encircle their houses with a high fence...
...and shoot at the towns people from their windows.
The towns people will beg; let me plough the ground...
...but they will be slain.
No man will like another man.
If two people are on one bench and one asks the other to move over...
...and the other does not, it will be his death.
That will be the time of the Clearing of the Benches.
She is cooling off, then she will not crack any more.
That is the pure ingredient.
What are factories still good for?
Paulin must dance naked on the table!
You will not be able to tell between summer and winter.
Everyone will have a different head...
...and the forest will get sparse, like the beggar's gown.
The small will be tall again.
When the Redcoats come with their red coats...
...then you must run fast and take a loaf of bread with you.
Whoever has three loaves and drops one on the way, must not stoop.
Even if you loose the second one, you must leave it behind...
...you can subsist with one loaf...
...because it does not last long.
The few who survive must have an iron head.
People become ill...
...but no one can help them.
Those who will survive...
...will stick together and call each other Brother and Sister.
- Take everything off.
- So we can see something!
The factory is on fire!
The factory is on fire!
If it is burning, I would like to be there, where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?
For twelve years there has been no fire.
And my shoes are gone.
People settle down as though never wanting to leave this world.
But over night the clearing of the world begins.
From the Orient, a huge bird appears and shits into the sea.
The sea rises as high as a house, and boils.
The earth trembles and a big island half drowns.
The big city with the iron tower is in flames...
...but the fire was started by its own men, and the city is leveled.
In Italy the clergy is killed and the churches collapse.
The Pope sits in a cell.
During his flight he consecrates a goat as bishop.
People starve.
The three days of darkness draw nearer.
Where the black box drops, a green and yellow dust arises.
The weather will change.
Vineyards will be grown here...
...and there is fruit that I do not know.
Ludmilla.
Ludmilla lies dead in the master's office...
...and Toni plays her one song after another on his harp.
Hias has wished this calamity on us.
I merely predicted it.
He has Devil's eyes, he has the Evil Eye. Lock him up!
I do not see any more.
It is so dark.
I must see something again.
I must go to the woods.
I have to go to the woods.
I want to see the woods again.
Don't you want to see any people?
I like you.
You have a heart of glass.
And now I'm going to roast the bear.
In the night someone looks across the forest and sees not a single light.
And when he sees a juniper bush in the twilight...
...he runs to see if it isn't a human being, there are so few left.
In the forest, roosters crow, but the people have perished.
Something else occurs to me.
I see it again.
A coachman stops and gets down from his coach...
...he knocks down on the ground with his whip and says:
"There was once the big town of Straubing."
Now I see the rocky island again.
I see it quite clearly.
A rocky island far out in the sea, and a second, smaller island.
They lie on the far edge of the inhabited world.
On one island, for centuries, some forgotten men have lived.
And because they live on the far edge of the inhabited world...
...word has not reached them that the earth is round.
They have retained the belief that the earth is flat...
...and that the ocean far beyond ends in a yawning abyss.
I see a man on top of the rock.
For years he stood alone, looking out over the sea...
...day after day, always in the same place.
He is the first one to doubt.
Then, years later, three other men join him.
For many years they gaze across the sea from the rock.
Then, one day, they decide to risk the ultimate.
They want to reach the edge of the world, to see if there is really an abyss.
Musicians accompany their departure.
Then the men set out, pathetic and senseless.
In a boat that is far too small.
It may have seemed like a sign of hope...
...that the birds followed them out into the vastness of the sea.
Tefaia. Village of Epeiros, of Tinthis county, loannina district.
Located beyond mount Tomaros, where ancient Tefaia was.
Remains of pelasgian walls indicate occupation since ancient years.
Habitants, according to the
1939 census, 1250.
Habitants, according to the
1965 census, 85.
What's your name?
Don't you speak?
What's your name?
Won't you kiss your father?
How could he remember me?
Do you want to eat?
Reconstruction
Is that how it happened?
And then?
Wait a second.
What was the condition of the murdered one at that time?
I was dizzy.
I don't know.
I was dizzy.
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Right away.
Then Hristos Gikas pulled the rope.
What did you do?
I couldn't watch it and went to the kitchen.
Then he swore at me.
He was shouting at me to hold the rope and swore.
- Who made the loop?
- He did.
And he gave it to me to spread it with oil, so it would slide.
I was dizzy.
I did whatever he told me.
What about the murdered one, didn't he fight?
He was a sick man.
He fell down.
He writhed twice.
We realised that he died.
And Hristos Gikas untied the rope from the door it was tied to.
We heard my children's voices returning from school.
He told me: "What can we do so that the children won't see it?"
I am going to check the fox's hole.
He doesn't fit in there.
Shall we cut him?
Your father left once again.
I planted some onions in the garden.
I was behind the door... and he couldn't see me.
Eleni got out from inside...
I grabbed him from behind... and she placed the rope in his neck and pulled it.
Until he choked and fell down.
- I didn't pull the rope at all.
- She says that you placed the rope.
Lies! I swear by my kids! She wants to eliminate me as well!
Bring him.
And you brought him here.
We were afraid that her children might come.
We heard their voices in the yard.
We grabbed him and threw him in this hole... in order to hide him until it was dark.
Then she went to the yard with her children.
I left.
I was drifting here and there.
Late in the night I returned, as we had agreed.
How is it going?
You know how it is.
Heads or tails?
Take it.
- What do you want?
- I need to see you.
I told everybody that Kostas left for Gianenna to
Come in the night, Hristos.
I can't.
Tomorrow, or the day after that,
I'll see.
- Where are you going?
- Gianenna. My wife's sick.
Kaliopi! Come down.
- I don't have an ID. Passport only.
- That'll do.
Did you work abroad?
- What's your name?
- Kostas Goussis.
And your lady?
- Huh? Sofia.
- I didn't mean that.
Was she abroad with you?
Give me the letter.
- Since when is it?
- It's old.
- Since when?
- Since the first time you went to Germany.
- A ticket for Athens.
- What's your name?
Kostas Goussis.
"Tonight at Palladion, the Kaneli Troupe
will present the musical comedy
'Soldier's Dreams'
that went like a bomb at Agrinio.
Tonight at Palladion!
What happened?
Let's go for a walk.
- Mr Interrogator!
- No pictures please.
- So?
- This is her first testimony, are you interested?
Of course it's not a simple reportage, it's an investigation.
"At Tefaia, on 8/4/1970, before me, 
Police Officer of Mesohorio, turned up Sofia Goussis, wife of 
Kostas Goussis, 35 years old, housewife, Christian Orthodox, and voluntarily confessed the following:
'On 7/3/1970 while I was at my husband's
Kostas Goussis house at Tefaia we quarrelled for moral reasons because my sister-in-law Labrini told him that I wasn't true to him.
During this quarrell he was saying that I had a boyfriend.
He then attacked me with an iron from the window and hit me at my body.
I took a rope and choked him.
Then I went to the garden of my house and buried him.
I repent, but it's late. 
I have nothing to add. '
So, Mr. Interrogator, in the beginning she took all the responsibilities.
Yes, but we already knew about the hayward's accessorial guilt.
With suitable treatment we extorted his confession.
We isolated him and told him that the woman considers him as the sole cause of the crime.
The known, usual method.
Now they are blaming each other.
Something more, Mr. Interrogator.
Your view on the cause.
Everybody says that the victim was the ideal householder.
Honest, diligent and that he wasn't a barrier to his wife's relationships.
As the only cause of the crime we should consider the immoral character of the accused woman.
The remark is right.
It's past all understanding.
The husband... His tolerance.
Well... Irressistible attraction to crime or ignoble financial causes.
There is this version as well.
- Anyway it's all about people with no morals.
- What will happen with her children?
- After agreement with her relatives the two young ones will be sent to an orphan asylum.
Concerning the older daughter, an merchant prince from Giannena offered to take her as a servant girl or something like that. The house will be closed down and sold by her siblings.
I didn't understand how it happened.
I didn't mean it, I swear.
I recall thinking to tell her that I didn't want any part in that.
But I couldn't.
I remember that.
It was like she cast a spell over me.
We are journalists from Athens.
We're looking for the hayward's wife.
- What did you do to my brother-in-law?
- He went to Germany.

What the heII...
-My God!
-Jesus! Jesus!
Why, you're ItaIian.
And you... who are you?
-Were you on that train?
-Damn right I was.
Damned miserabIe woods.
You scared me to death.
These Germans, first they shoot and then ask, who's there?
You're teIIing me.
Maybe you can teII me where the heII we are.
I'd say it's Germany, huh.
Anyway, what I say is we're better off here...
-...than on the train.
-That's for sure.
That train is a bIast furnace.
-Poor bastards.
-Yes, poor them.
You know, I'm not reaIIy wounded.
I've got to be a deserter, or worse... by now.
Worse. No doubt about that.
Faking a wound...
Anyway...
It's pretty good.
It Iooks reaI, my Iad.
I saved myseIf, but I was heIped out... by a dead man, may his souI rest in peace.
With aII due respect for the dead...
I had to take his bandages.
Instead of being in
StaIingrad, I'm here.
So, I said to my men, where are we going?
What are we doing, running around Iike this?
Who wants to go around kiIIing?
Let's go. Go back home.
You can't work for peopIe... who send you out here with cardboard shoes.
Here, where when you bIow your nose you get... a crystaI chandeIier, and when you shit... you get icicIes.
So I grabbed two trucks and sent the men home.
I hope they made it.
They wouId have had me shot tomorrow.
I hate the miIitary courts here.
-How Iong is this river!
-It must be the Rhine.
-Where's that?
-It's stiII in Germany.
Then it's stiII a pain in the ass.
Damn!
-Who were they?
-Maybe they are Jews.
-That's impossibIe.
-It's possibIe... and we happen to be as guiIty as they are.
We're accompIices to those rotten shits.
Why do you think that we're accompIices?
Because we didn't make a sound... didn't come out and spit in their faces.
We couId have, but we ran instead.
That's crazy.
How couId we have?
They'd have come after us and we'd be shot.
UseIess suicide.
No, it wouIdn't have been useIess... because in the face of certain things you've got... to say no, and instead,
I said yes... to MussoIini, to duty, and to aII that crap.
In this war I've kiIIed... bastards I didn't even know.
I kiIIed before the war, but I had my reasons.
I kiII Iike an idiot, for no reason.
Did it for a woman.
I kiIIed for a woman...
A woman...
She must be kidding!
What more do you want?
Screw off!
Let's see you dance... waIking crow!
Screw off! Drop dead.
How about Ietting me tickIe you aII over?
You can tickIe your Mama!
I'II give you something, so don't push.
Nothing easy about me!
-What a Iass!
-We want more!
What do you want me to do?
There! There!
Give us more!
-Take it off!
-Come on!
Forget it! Fuck you!
There! There!
-PasquaIino!
-Let's taIk, Concetti.
Look at yourseIf in the mirror.
Go on, take a Iook at yourseIf.
Are you pretty?
No, you're not pretty.
You're not even inteIIigent.
Among Mom and our sisters... there isn't a penny.
I'm the onIy man in the house with eight women... there's one thing
I've tried to defend.
One thing, our honor!
To defend and protect that honor as best I can... not being the biggest or strongest man in the worId.
I carry this thing around,
I wear this gun.
They know about it, and they have to respect us.
And you ugIy, miserabIe pig... put your disgusting thighs in dispIay... in a musicaI... because that Iousy rat said he'd make you famous.
That fiIthy bastard who heIped to get you started... and gave you this job.
I'II kiII him.
-No!
-I'II shoot him.
You mustn't! I beg you.
He'II marry me!
He promised!
I'm going on 37.
I'II be a spinster!
Better a spinster than a whore!
-I must kiII him.
-No!
Potono'II marry me.
First he'II make me somebody...
-...then his bride.
-Somebody!
Somebody! Come on...
Look at yourseIf, a squawking crow.
Didn't you hear them?
DisgracefuI! What a shame!
I'II kiII that Potono!
No, I'm through! I have a much better contract.
He'II heIp me sing at the CIub Margarita... then he'II marry me.
He made a promise.
He Ioves me very much.
One month, eh?
I give him one month... to straighten things up.
Our house mustn't be dishonored.
You understand, idiot?!
Understand?
Imagine the eIdest becoming a whore!
What wiII the others do, become whores?
He's got a month to to marry you... or I'II kiII him.
The word of PasquaIino
Seven Beauties.
Do you understand?
Rosina, my carnation.
Coming right up, PasquaIino.
Damn Francesco! After aII this time in Africa.
Now they're sending him to Spain.
We needed another war.
It wasn't enough Iast time.
Now we'II never get married.
Don't give up hope. Because with God's heIp... he may stiII be Iucky enough to get a nice wound... in his Ieg or his arm.
You'd get a pension for Iife and you'd be set.
-What are you saying?
-Or he'II Iose an eye.
What crazy taIk, Mama!
Hey, Mama, we don't enjoy such Iucky accidents...
-...in our famiIy.
-Yes, of course.
It wiII pass.
Grandma.
Rough up those mattresses.
PasquaIino,
Ieave it in the drawer.
Are you Iooking for troubIe?
Hey, Mama, it doesn't get you into troubIe...
They Iearn to fear you, and respect you.
And beIieve me, they aII respect me.
Excuse us for a moment, famiIy business.
You'II pardon us?
He has to taIk to them in private.
We have business to discuss.
-It's a big secret.
-Who gives a damn!
Quiet. You can't trust them to Iick Leno's famiIy...
Is that cIear?
Mama, Iook, money to buy groceries.
-Lucky Mama.
-I'm sick of bread and onions.
Buy an egg for each one of you... and be carefuI of cheats.
It'd disgust anybody... to Iook at such yeIIow faces.
There's a Iot to be done if they're ever to get married.
Stop that!
Now, Iisten to me.
Don't Iet anybody see your eyes, Iook down... or you may be taken for a cheap IittIe tart.
And I'II beat the first one who misbehaves. Remember.
SmiIe, no reason to be upset Iike that.
Cheer up.
Have a good day.
And you too, LouiseIIe.
And you too. Hmm?
Don't Iook so gIoomy, eh?
SmiIe for a change!
What's the matter with you?
What the heII do you think you're doing?
Don't stop singing!
We need the money!
Understand? Go on, sing!
You, get going!
LittIe girI, have your parrot teII my fortune.
-Why the tears?
-It's my mother's fauIt.
I never couId sing,
I go off pitch.
To make me sing is wrong.
Don't make fun of me.
But it doesn't matter, you can yeII.
The men bother me.
They make fun and tease.
Can't you answer back?
If anyone faiIs to respect you...
You just say that you're my fiancee. Hmm?
In these words.
Say you're engaged to
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
But I'm not your fiancee.
It's faIse.
At the moment. In a few years, things couId happen.
Never try to predict the weather, or the future.
Think about growing up.
Say, come on, try.
Even you started steaIing from the cradIe.
JeaIousy is an ugIy thing.
Excuse me, Don RaphaeIe,
I don't understand.
What's the matter?
I've aIways been IoyaI.
It's not about IoyaIty.
I'm interested in peopIe who know how to show respect.
What are you taIking about?
What are you referring to?
I'II teII you what I'm referring to.
I'm taIking about someone... who doesn't respect his famiIy.
-In what sense?
-I'II teII you.
At 3 o'cIock, you'd better be at the PoIonetto.
Have a Iook around. See what they're doing to you.
Potono bought your sister a pair of shoes... with red bows on them, and put her in there for Iife.
We have a cIient.
My God! It's my brother!
-Who is he?
-No, it's her brother!
Prostitute!
Stupid bitch!
Are you satisfied now... your fiance got you into this business? Idiot!
What a disgrace! You brought dishonor on us!
Let go! Get the heII out of my way!
TeII me where he is... or I'II murder you, do you hear me?!
How do I find that son of a bitch?!
I can't breathe.
Let go of my throat first!
This is how he married you, that Iousy bastard.
Disgracing our house!
Where is he?
-Right here.
-FiIth! Go home!
How can I, dressed this way?
-Take this.
-Go Iike this.
Go home!
No, PasquaIino! No!
Don't kiII him!
I Iove him, pIease!
Screw you and your Iove! Idiot!
Eighteen Karat Potono, is that you?
-Damn right.
-Damn right.
Weren't you going to marry my sister, Concettina?
You promised and therefore you'II marry her.
Who are you? Who the heII do you think you are?
MiserabIe worm. Get out.
I didn't understand.
Does that heIp you understand? Have a good day.
-Poor boy.
-WiII he be aII right?
Get that mess out of here!
We've got customers!
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is that rotten son of a bitch? Where'd he go?
It's reaIIy not worth bothering about.
Isn't it? I'm going to chop his head off.
Scum, humiIiating me.
He won't Iive Iong.
Eighteen Karat Potono... wake up!
I won't shoot out the brains of a sIeeping man.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up. It's me.
No, Jesus! Don't shoot.
You're the one who caused it.
You caIIed me miserabIe worm, remember?
Find that pistoI, I need it.
Find it and be quick! It's important to my defense.
He's dead.
Where the heII are we?
Hey, Jesus, what...
I smeII onions.
Ah, Signora.
Good morning, goet morgen.
Excuse me for coming in without permission. Stay quiet.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm hungry.
I'm an ItaIian soIdier.
Understand? No?
That's aII right.
FrauIien Deutsche.
Oh, something to eat.
ItaIian soIdier, NapIes.
Sunshine, bIue water... mandoIins.
Understand? A pizza pie with tomatoes on top... or macaroni. There's food in here. I'm starving!
Ah, Deutsche soup.
Nice and hot.
Signora, I'm hungry.
I'II have some bread... with your permission.
Oh, bread with stew?
It's so good. Our Mama often gave us stew in NapIes.
A Mama, Signora, is never forgotten.
You're a Mama too. Your daughter at the piano... she'II catch coId with her bare ass out.
Hard times, Signora, the war's been responsibIe.
Shh, if someone's there,
I... no, it's aII right.
Soup, bread, potatoes...
I'm taking some bread for my friend.
He's ItaIian.
This is for him.
A drop of wine, cin-cin, saIute.
Good wine. Guten.
I'd Iike to be your guest...
Your daughter, she has a great ass... but I have to run.
Thank you.
May you Iive to be a hundred.
Oh, saIami... saIami and some cheese.
Dankeschun, Bitteschun, auf wiedersehn...
Good night, Signora.
What's that about?
Groundsport. A mysterious word, amigo.
We must work occasionaIIy, or eIse acid bath...
-...or crematorium.
-How d'you know? Who're you?
That's how it is.
I'm a death expert.
I know an anarchist whose bombs didn't work.
MussoIini, HitIer,
CeIIezar.
I've got faiIure after faiIure.
These peopIe have made a business out of death.
That goddamn rotten whore!
What's the worId coming to?
How the heII did the worId ever get Iike this?
And we Iet ourseIves get kiIIed this way.
Nobody says anything.
The Jews, who were supposed to be so smart...
The brave Russians... who began the revoIution... they're not rebeIIing.
My rotten Iuck, ending up in this shitpiIe.
Jesus! They're pIaying waItz.
My God! My God!
Like sheep about to be sIaughtered.
It can't be.
Francesco,
I don't want to die.
I can't accept that.
I'm stiII young.
I had a miserabIe Iife.
I wouId've Iiked to change it, but I never managed to.
I can't die Iike this.
I just can't die Iike this.
I'II try and get out of here.
I'II do it! I'II find a way to get out of here...
Starting at this moment.
A woman is a woman,
PasquaIino.
And a woman, even one who is an eviI person, has... a IittIe good for someone who can reach her heart.
There's a bit of sugar aIways there.
The song goes...
In a cup of coffee,
RosaIie
UgIy to take, unsavory
Sugary, burnt and wasting
Can make it distastefuI
So I must stir her up,
Like a sugar in the cup
To bring to my Iips
What's sweet and fine
La Ia Ia Ia Ia
You're crazy, PasquaIino.
Yes, but I must try.
It's dangerous.
She's crueI, sadistic.
I understand aII that.
But I had a vision.
It was a song, something my Mama said... that bit of sugar,
I know it's there.
Soon, no matter how rotten she is... or how eviI, she's no exception.
She must need Iove.
I'm right, Franche.
You're educated, but in the matter of women...
-I'm way ahead of you.
-I'm sure you'd be.
Do you know how peopIe used to caII me?
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
-They did?
-Because I'm ugIy.
You Iook terribIe, aII right.
But that was the point.
In spite of my Iooks...
I appeaIed to women.
They Ioved me.
PeopIe were amazed.
They'd say, it's unbeIievabIe. he's repuIsive.
Others repIied... he must have the Seven Beauties...
That's how it came to be my name, see?
No, but I beIieve you.
I appeaI to the Iadies.
I used to appeaI to them.
The fact is... without any exaggeration...
I haven't Iooked at the mirror in years.
And since I know from the beginning... that I've aIways been an ugIy man...
I'II admit it's been bothering me.
How have I turned out?
My teeth have become Ioose.
I can't keep my eyes open.
My ass has dropped.
Look at me and teII me honestIy.
How do I Iook?
AwfuI, to be quite honest.
I'd forget it.
No! I'm bound to be kiIIed, so why not?
I want to Iive, have chiIdren.
See my chiIdren's chiIdren, and more... and the chiIdren of my chiIdren's chiIdren.
AII the chiIdren
I can possibIy have.
-BuIIshit, amigo.
-You pig!
How dare you teII me what to do!
Who are you?! How dare you insuIt me Iike that?!
Come on, that's nonsense, you're taIking buIIshit... because the more chiIdren you have... the faster the end wiII come.
In what sense?
What do you mean?
In the year 1400 there were
500 miIIion peopIe on earth.
By the year 1850 the amount had doubIed to one biIIion.
Now we're aII... extremeIy indignant... because of the death of 20 miIIion men... but in 200 or 300 years... there'II be a Iot more of us, 30 biIIion or more.
Anywhere you go on earth wiII be worse than here.
That's when men are going to butcher each other... and murder an entire famiIy... for a piece of bread or an appIe... and the worId wiII end.
Too bad, because
I beIieve in man... but soon... very soon, a new man...
A new man wiII be born.
He'II have to be civiIized... not this beast who's been endowed with inteIIigence... and obIiterated the harmony in the worId... and brought about totaI destruction... just by disturbing nature's equiIibrium.
A new man... abIe to rediscover the harmony that's within.
You mean, put things in order?
Order? No, no...
The orderIy ones are the Germans.
A new man in disorder is our onIy hope.
A new man in disorder.
You made a mistake, boy.
You made a mistake.
You shouId've waited untiI he got his revoIver out.
I waited about 5 minutes, but... he didn't have a gun around.
He didn't have a weapon.
You shouIdn't have shot him... or given Potono a gun.
I onIy had one.
You shouId've had two with you.
You can't never be carefuI enough.
This case demanded the simpIest of care.
You must prepare for the job.
You shouId throw him his gun, defend yourseIf.
He picks the gun up, you shoot him.
You didn't murder him.
SeIf-defense.
Later on, the case comes up, a quick triaI.
In no time you're out and you're respected.
It's a breeze, get it?
Don RaphaeI, how couId I have known?
A reaI man prepares a job with foresight... or eIse anyone at aII wouId be abIe to do it.
Now you're in troubIe... of making it aII disappear.
50% is aII you can hope to get out of it moraIIy.
I'm taIking about respect.
You must make yourseIf a name.
You need Iots of pubIicity.
For this you need discretion.
The man's on a trip now.
He's gone to America.
It's a supposition, but we must be sure.
-He's disappeared.
-Sounds simpIe.
How am I to fix it?
Throw him in the bay?
It'II rise to the top... you'II go straight to prison.
MarveIous, perfect, dammit!
Dear God.
Imagination. A creative effort's needed.
Easy, no?
Like smoking a cigarette.
Smoking cigarettes, anybody can do that.
The man who wants to be something more... needs the guts to perform!
The nerve to do things that normaIIy... no one eIse couId possibIy imagine. Get the point?
I get the point,
Don RaphaeI.
You seem nervous, my boy.
-CaIm down, my boy.
-I am caIm.
There are men at the mention of whose name... the whoIe worId trembIes.
-Get my point, PasquaIino?
-I get it.
You're inteIIigent... you foIIow everything
I teII you.
I foIIow, Don RaphaeI.
As I expIained... you couId make a great start for yourseIf... with this opportunity, or not.
Of course, it's entireIy up to you.
Potono has to disappear.
Don't pay attention... to anyone who taIks about the American system.
TraditionaI cement shoes were invented here in NapIes.
Chicago and New York just make cheap imitations.
It's pIagiarism.
The king-size coffin is our invention.
When you see a funeraI in NapIes, nobody knows... how many bodies are in the coffin.
When things get busy,
2 or 3 can be stuffed in.
Depends on the demand.
We invented everything here in NapIes.
For exampIe, you know the ancient graveyard... weII, when they first opened it... they found 500 skeIetons.
Now, there are 5,000.
The question is, who put the other 4,500 in there?
So, as I said, it depends on the demand.
Oh, God.
He's so ugIy.
Wait a minute, here.
Son of a bitch.
Even dead, you are a pig.
Just a big bag of wind.
I knew it.
Dammit!
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Who are you?
Who is it?
Who's there?
What's going on?
Who's there?
What's going on?
-Get going.
-Where to?
To the station.
And hurry.
Damn stupid animaI!
BIind idiot!
You shouId be ashamed of yourseIf!
You have no respect for a poor bIind man!
Son of a bitch!
What is this? Stay back.
Keep your hands off me, pIease. Get back.
WiII you get back!
I don't want any heIp.
I'II manage myseIf.
I don't need heIp. PIease.
-I can manage myseIf.
-He's so strong!
Look. A big cheese box roped up wrong.
CouId you pIease take these?
Thanks.
How did you rap it?
Don't drop anything.
That's enough now!
-Where are you going?
-PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
You know that shipment of ProkoIoni.
It's been sent off.
PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
Good-bye.
It was your advice
I foIIowed... about creative thinking.
I don't think you'II hear about it anymore.
He kiIIed my Potono!
PoIice! He kiIIed him!
Live me aIone...
Give up!
You'II never take
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
Never wiII you be abIe to take him aIive.
-Stop bragging.
-So I'm wrong.
Achtung! Achtung!
-Are you out of your mind?
-Don't worry.
-Where are you going?
-Be quiet.
Shit!
Monster of NapIes confesses!
It's PasquaIino and no other. Latest edition!
Big murder story!
-So, you have confessed.
-Yes, Sir.
Nobody in his right mind ever confessed such a thing.
CompIete madness!
I wiII Iook ridicuIous.
What the heII do you think
I can teII the judge, huh?
It's impossibIe to defend this case.
Advocate, this time I Iost.
I'm gIad I confessed,
I'm a man of honor.
You're an asshoIe.
How dare you!
You'II pay for that!
CaIm down, or that'II be...
-the end of my visit.
-Who the heII are you?
Your Iawyer.
Do you want to kiII me as weII?
-Better hoId your tongue.
-Watch that asshoIe stuff.
I wanted to say incompetent.
It's not so simpIe.
I have a great reputation.
You understand, or not?
If you screw yourseIf,
I won't take the case.
How can I defend you if you teII the truth.
The monster of NapIes is captured and confesses.
Who ever heard of such a thing? Confesses...
It's unbeIievabIe!
Look, confesses to cutting up the victim... and shipping the body to 3 different cities.
To do it, I understand.
But to confess...
The onIy thing Ieft for us to do... is pIead insanity.
-I don't get it.
-I'II cIaim you're mad... out of your mind.
ReaIIy? I have to deny an honorabIe act... aimed at protecting the
Ioss of dignity... and pretend I'm a fooI.
Let's forget it, my friend.
Can't you understand?
Don't you see?
You're confused.
Look, they're going to condemn you to death, huh?
It's the firing squad.
I can't pIay the fooI.
I'm sorry about
Don RaphaeI... but I'II have to send you away.
You'II give me a scoop, understand?
-I won't do it.
-What shouId I do?
I have high bIood pressure.
I've got to stay caIm.
Make up your mind.
If you pIead insanity...
I'II defend you... and we may save your neck.
But if you prefer your stupid honor... we'II forget about it, and you're dead.
It's your Iife or your honor.
Think about it, PasquaIino
Porfusso, and Iet me know.
AII right, then, you can see your visitors.
Let the famiIy in now.
Mama! Mama! Mama!
-PasquaIino.
-Mama! -PasquaIino!
-Mama! -My PasquaIino!
-Mama!
-PasquaIino, my son!
-Mama!
Mama.
-My son. -Mama.
-At Iast I can see you.
You're teIIing me...
How you are?
I'm not so weII.
How about you?
Does Don RaphaeI give you anything?
He's been heIping us a IittIe... but not with money, just words... so it's been Ieft for us to manage somehow.
How do you manage?
I'II do aII I can...
-Concettina!
-PasquaIino!
He's a friend.
What do you want?
Your Iawyer's one of the best here in NapIes... recommended by Don RaphaeI.
He costs a Iot.
You did commit the crime.
She's not innocent...
It's one matter not being innocent.
Being a whore is another.
Now sweetheart, have a IittIe patience.
A rotten comedy, a Iousy farce... caIIed Iiving.
Your ass wiII drop... and your beIIy'II get fat without exercise.
Come on, run.
Keep the body beautifuI.
You'II be as good as new.
-ItaIians!
-What now?
Let's weIcome the war for the virtues it brings out... in those of us who have the guts to fight!
We're making history.
Our peopIe are... a race of distant warriors!
Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce!
It's very funny.
Our peopIe are poets and heroes.
-He's out of his mind.
-And that is their fame.
The chaIIenge this breed poses is a threat...
-to aII on earth.
-Take him away, eh?
PoIiticaI?
-No, hatchet kiIIer.
-Oh.
PasquaIino Porfuso,
'The Monster of NapIes'.
The act of an unbaIanced mind, 12 years.
You're Iucky. They gave me
28 years and 4 months.
Twenty-eight?!
How did it come to that?
I simpIy thought.
It's the most atrocious crime a citizen couId commit.
He doesn't want that.
-Ah, you're anti-fascist.
-SociaIist.
To teII the truth, poIitics are boring.
I've other interests.
Papa was a brickIayer. He taIked a IittIe SociaIism.
But I don't think about it anymore... because... because I think
II Duce is pretty great.
To be truthfuI, he's given us roads.
How much he's given, an entire empire.
AII the other countries are jeaIous of our Ieader.
Listening to the man speak to us... that voice, and those eyes... and his court found me compIeteIy insane.
And our peopIe are respected.
They used to spit at us,
ItaIians, on the face.
Remember those days?
Besides, there were many strikes, riots... demonstrations, we used to be in terribIe condition.
And thanks to him, there has been no disorder.
He is a marveI, you're right.
There has been Iaw and order, and... he's done it by outIawing unions and strikes.
The resuIt is that saIaries in 1919 were up... and today, peopIe are making Iess than haIf... whiIe the cost of Iiving has increased 30%.
You didn't know that, huh?
This MussoIini, of whom everyone envies us...
Do you know who envies us?
The IandIords!
The ItaIians are a bunch of fooIs...
Iistening to that man, that bag of air on his baIcony.
Your Duce.
Wait, wait... no.
CarefuI, they'II hear us.
You mentioned the strikes, and the riots?
At Ieast then we knew there was a disease... and we couId hope to get weII.
Now we imagine we're strong... and we hide the disease.
That man wiII bring our country to war.
That's the finaI catastrophe.
You put it weII.
What do you intend to do?
I don't bother with poIitics.
I go to the insane asyIum, stay there for 10 years.
It's just a question of getting things organized... becoming friendIy with some doctor or some nurse.
In NapIes, we're very inventive.
I might get assigned to cIean the women's quarters.
Then I'II have it made.
I'II be on Easy Street.
What do you know, you're awake.
Let me see how weII you've done.
-A IittIe bit.
-That's not much.
Not enough.
To pee is to Iive.
The more you pee, the more you Iive.
PasquaIino, how are you doing?
Do you Iike your new job as intended?
Keep up the good work.
I'm starting procedure... for a new psychiatric test.
You'II see, they'II Iet you out.
We have to put an end to this...
AII the judiciaI cases who end up here...
What are you doing?
What do you think?
A gift from heaven can't go to waste.
I've had no woman now for severaI months.
I'm so sorry, but I must ask you to forgive me.
I must, must have a Iook.
Just keep quiet. Leave it to me, I'm an expert.
Let me pIease you.
You want it.
Stupid bitch! Go to heII!
Shut up. Shut up, you idiot!
Shut up!
What do you want from me?
That'II keep you quiet.
I'II take care of you.
Like to bite, eh?
Rotted whore.
Stinking crazy bitch.
Now we'II show you.
Get his pants off.
Come on, move.
In 7 weeks we'II be out of here.
Then we'II Ieave, aII of us.
In 7 weeks we'II be out of here...
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
Even though you've done these terribIe things... you're normaI, you can't be shut up in here... with these hopeIess cases.
But you must controI yourseIf.
You know what a revision of your mentaI status entaiIs.
Your behavior is what counts most.
Eight more years here couId drive me crazy.
-I reaIIy mean it.
-I know, I know... but you must make an effort because now is your chance.
PasquaIino, ItaIy is at war now... and they'II be needing aII the men they can get.
They can't be fussy about anyone who voIunteers... even someone coming out of prison.
Of course, this doesn't appIy to mentaI patients.
But if we'II ran psychiatric tests... to demonstrate you've made a compIete recovery...
HeIp me.
I want to go on Iiving.
That isn't asking so much.
HeIp me.
HeIp me...
I'II try my best for you but...
I'm afraid this war wiII end in a terribIe massacre.
It couIdn't be more terribIe than in here.
I'm ready to do anything to get out of here.
I'm ready to do anything to Iive... anything.
I'm ready to do anything...
Crematorium zeks.
AII right. What exactIy is your game, shit macaroni?
Jesus, you speak ItaIian!
Then I can taIk to you.
At Iast, I can taIk to you.
Who are... who are you?
An enchantress, or a magician?
Because you put a speII on me.
When I saw you the first time...
I was... I...
What are you saying, you disgusting macaroni?
I Iove... I'm in Iove with you.
I Iove you very much.
Strip.
What? Did I hear right?
You asked me to strip?
AII right.
I'm wiIIing because I'd
Iike to make you Iaugh... because I Iove you.
You hate me.
You aII despise me.
You want something to eat.
You Iove me to get something to eat...
I'm sorry, Signora.
You know how hungry I am.
But what goes on inside my heart...
You have no idea.
You're right. Everybody hates you. I shouId too.
I shouId hate you because I've never seen... a woman Iike you.
I have to admit
I'm crazy... but the reason I'm crazy is because... because I'm not convinced you are as you seem.
Who are you reaIIy?
I need to know who you are.
TeII me the truth.
No. Of course you're not a witch or an enchantress.
I'm convinced you're just a poor victim. Yes.
You're a victim because you're forced into... forced to kiII...
You kiII out of a sense of duty.
Not a witch at aII, you are a victim, Iike we are.
There's a reaI femaIe under that uniform... and imagine the rosy fIesh, deIicate and beautifuI... and soft to touch.
It drives me out of my head.
Yes, I've gone out of my head.
To caress sainted fIesh is something I dream about...
Yes, I can hardIy stand on my feet.
I think of you and I become weak.
I'm in Iove. Love is madness, it's a disease.
When you're in Iove, you
Iose aII perspective...
I've gone crazy thinking of you.
That's why I did what I did and that's why I'm here now.
And that's why I'm asking you one big favor, one.
I'm going to be kiIIed and
I ask to be kiIIed by you.
By the touch of your hand.
I beg you, touch me... and I'd be very gIad if you'd kiII me now. Touch me.
You shit, NeopoIitan.
You can hardIy stand.
You cannot keep on pIaying in this comedy of yours.
You want to eat.
Now, you'II make
Iove to me... then I'II kiII you with my bare hands. Verstanden?
-It's what you asked, no?
-Yes, thank you.
You have to be patient.
I Iove you, but I'm weak.
You can't even open your eyes.
You don't have the energy for an erection.
Wake up!
Better eat, NapIes.
Now you eat, afterward you fuck.
If you don't fuck, you're kaput.
Bibi, my first Iove... heIp me get it up.
I want to see your eyes.
Drek.
You disgust me.
Your thirst for Iife disgusts me.
Your Iove disgusts me.
In Paris, there is a Greek... who found strength to make Iove to a goose.
He screwed for what it gave him... something to eat.
It meant survivaI.
And you, sub-human ItaIian.
You found the strength for an erection.
And because you were strong you'II manage to Iive on... and eventuaIIy you'II win.
MiserabIe creature, Iacking in ideaIs and ideas... and we... we who thought to create a master race... are doomed to faiIure.
You're in Barracks No.23, right? Good.
Starting right now, you're to be in charge.
That's an order.
As head of Barracks 23... you are to designate any 6 that you Iike... to be eIiminated at once.
Ya.
Or eIse I eIiminate aII the men.
You are to choose any 6.
And the others may get something to eat... even survive.
You pick 6, or you'II aII be creminated. Understand?
Kaput.
The choice is yours.
You pig, you rotten dirty.
Now you're a butcher Iike the rest of us.
FiIthy sub-human ItaIian.
-No.
-I've got to.
The bitch said so.
Either 6 or aII of us.
Every Iast one of them is doomed to die.
At Ieast we'II save our ass.
No. We'II be just
Iike them...
That's what they want.
We must say no.
And aII the men wiII be dead tomorrow?
AII the men, tomorrow.
Screw off.
Say what you want... but remember who's boss.
Here, Group 3. Whoever they may be, I'm not interested.
Into 14. I don't want to know who they are.
Here, the first 6.
You need onIy 5.
-What do you mean?
-I voIunteer.
You're crazy. Why?
Because I'm fed up with this.
Come on, get in Iine.
It's an order!
It's an order, go on!
Number 9423...
Somebody smuggIed food into Barracks 23.
In addition, stoIen property of the 3rd Reich... was found in Barracks 23.
As punishment for the breaking of reguIations... these 6 men wiII face a firing squad.
Hey!
Enough with this fear!
I've had enough! Living in aII this dark terror!
I'm going to throw myseIf in the shit...
Screw you!
Stop!
Stop!
A man in disorder!
Get him out.
FiIthy rats! Bastards!
Lousy rotten sons of bitches! You fiIth!
-Francesco!
-Dirty pigs!
-Francesco!
-FiIthy murderers!
Enough of your fiIthy kiIIing!
Lousy, rotten, no good animaIs!

-SiIIy bastards!
Shut up, Francesco!
You're crazy.

No, I don't want to Iive any Ionger!
Death can't be any worse than this!
FaII down! Pretend.
PIease shut up!

I'II have the satisfaction of yeIIing at them...
-FiIthy pigs!
-You're mad!
-Inhuman sons of bitches!
-France.
Rotten animaIs!
God, what do they want?
What do they want?
I won't shoot him.
Shoot.
Shoot. Hurry up, you'II be freeing me...
Come on, shoot!
Somebody eIse wiII shoot me if you won't.
At Ieast you're my friend.
Now, shoot, pIease...
You'II be doing me a favor.
Shoot!
I won't be tortured any more.
Don't you understand?
I can't pIay the hero much Ionger.
Don't make me ashamed in front of the others.
Shoot! Do me a favor...
Come on!
Go on, shoot, dammit.
Mama, guess!
It's PasquaIino!
PasquaIino is aIive!
He's aIive, I don't beIieve it!
He's aIive! PasquaIi!
PasquaIi! My boy is aII right!
And so you turned out to be a whore too, huh?
Yes.
And did you earn enough to get aIong?
Yes.
Good. Now quick, you're giving it up... we're getting married.
There isn't much time to Iose.
I want chiIdren.
Many chiIdren: 25, 30.
It's a matter of seIf-defense.
They must be strong.
Look at the crowds out there.
Soon, they'II be murdering each other... famiIies sIaughtered, for an appIe.
So we must see to it our famiIy is Iarge.
That'II be our defense, understand?
I've aIways Ioved you very much.
And I'm ready.
We'II get married, the sooner the better.
PIease, PasquaIino, don't worry...
Thank the Madonna for returning you to us.
One mustn't Iook back on what's passed.
It's so senseIess.
What's done is done.
Have a Iook at yourseIf, my son.
You're beautifuI.
The war is ended.
It's useIess to think about these miseries...
PasquaIino, you're aIive.
AIive!
Yes, I'm aIive.
A NI KKATSU PRODUCTION
Her name's Miki, mister.
- Miki.
- Miki, tell us about it.
This guy touched my butt and did dirty things.
What kind of dirty things?
Unspeakable things.
So you did something unspeakable, did you?
No, of course not.
I didn't... Ask someone else.
Someone else?
- I'm "Someone Else."
- Not you.
Pile of crap! Moron!
He's hardly worth it.
Hey, let me see that.

- Did you sleep with him?
- Yes.
With who?
We smoked hashish together and played un-dress-up.
He told me I have nice tits and kissed me lots of times.
And then?
And he kissed my stomach and here and there, too.
Here and there, huh?
You're so stupid, Miki.
You think I'm lying? Ask her.
- Ask who?
- I'm upset, too.
- Miki, you should stop now.
- Wanna fight?
- Mako.
- Come on.
Stop it.
Mako. Miki.
JAPANESE PEOPLE WELCOME TOO!
Megumi, Peko, find a car.
Mako.
Don't worry, Yuka.
Cool car! Be quiet!
Hurry!
Let me do that!
Let's see if it'll start.
Miki, aim right, now.
Do it! Do it!
Right... right.
Right there! There! There!
You got her!
I'm gonna get your face!
Mako!
I'll kill you!
Mako, that's enough!
You're fighting Miki.
She cut me.
Please stop!
Yuka! Don't!
It's your fault, Mako.
Anybody messes with me, I fight!
Cops!
She'll die! Miki!
Grow up before you talk back to me.
What are you laughing at?
- Are you okay, Miki?
- Hold on.
Let's go, Mako.
Get her looked after.
No names
No life stories between us
Not even good-byes
The contour of my kiss
Remains on your sweat-soiled skin
We both devoured the short time we shared
Our night together will soon be over
I didn't want us to part as strangers
So I stole your love away
Keep singing.
You scared me.
Somebody could step on you down there.
Helluva place to cool off.
Keep singing.
You're bleeding.
Critical condition.
Where are you headed?
Know a bar called "Mama Blues"?
Nope.
Put this on.
Put it on me.
What's the matter?
It's no good.
What's not?
It's no fun.
I don't get it.
I don't get it either, but...
Better lick your wound.
- Who are you?
- Kazuma, O-ka-mo-to.
Kazuma.
You look strong.
Yeah, well...
I've got no real complaints
I dress up as much as possible
I can't help feeling something's missing
HopJump Step Up Stop
Do you understand this feeling?
- Treat us, mister.
- All right.
Give me a spaghetti, ham-egg, and...
Whiskey-Coke.
What's her name, the girl sitting in the corner?
I don't know.
Aren't they your friends?
Why don't you introduce me?
Get my order, bartender?
Spaghetti, ham-egg and milk, right?
I said whiskey-Coke, not milk, you jerk!
I got it, I got it.
Who's he?
Miki always steps out of shit smelling like a rose.
Miki, are you all right?
How about you?
That guy over there told me it'll heal if I lick it.
Never seen him before.
He's looking for a bar called "Mama Blues."
Mari goes there a lot.
Yeah?
Mari, come here.
What?
This is a good song.
I love this song.
I'm sure you'd like my place.
Even my record collection is nothing to be ashamed of, you know.
Hi, Baron.
You know a mushroom called "Clavaria"?
They say if you eat one, you'll die in eight minutes.
Open your mouth.
You're kidding.
He thinks you're joking.
How is it? Tasty?
Better swallow it.
Horrible!
What's up, Baron?
Just good customer service.
We're picking you ladies up.
A trip? Let's go!
Count me out.
Baron.
Mari, let's go.
No.
Why not?
I just don't want to.
Can't help it.
Who was it said she wanted to sleep with me forever?
Who was it said she felt best when I made love to her?
I don't know.
I've got plenty.
I'll do you all night long... like the last time.
What time is it?
Ten to 11:00.
- Where you going?
- Let me go!
That's fast!
You two already at it?
Mari.
Don't you get it?
Mari's in love.
What?
With who?
Check out "Mama Blues."
Peko, your tongue loosens up so fast.
Idiot. You're the one that's fast and loose.
What's up?
Your eyes look strange.
I smoked a little.
With that gang again?
I'm okay because I have you, Ichiro.
What's on your mind?
You. It's always you.
You know where she went?
Yeah, she split.
I heard you were looking after her and she was doing fine.
She was a good girl, very much so.
She was cute and kind, and everybody liked her, too.
But she split.
Why?
Just forget about her.
No way.
If you don't want to tell me,
I'll look for her myself.
Mari, come here.
No, I won't.
Ichiro, no. Don't go!
Let me go!
Keep away from my bitch.
Got that?
No!
No, huh?
Lay off.
Stay outta this.
Ichiro!
Baron, why don't you ever fuck me?
Aren't up to it?
What's up?
Mari...
A half-breed stole my Mari.
They'll...
They'll take all our women, one day.
They mauled her and stomped all over her.
She was wailing, but I couldn't do a thing for my sister.
So what do you suggest we do?
Kick 'em out.
We'll kick every last one of'em out ofhere.
What are you doing?
Get out of this town.
Won't leave, huh?
Are you really from here?
No hard feelings, but you should leave.
Why?
Why? It's better for your safety.
No way!
What the fuck? You dog!
You two married?
No.
Then don't sit so close!
Why not?
Because his thing stinks!
What are you going to do?
Stop!
They're such wimps.
This war game is fun.
This is no game!
This is a real war!
What are you doing?
We're protecting you girls.
Protecting us?
Your chastity.
Mind your own fucking business!
Who asked you?
We don't need your protection!
Mari.
Ichiro says hello.
- He said he'd write you.
- What are you talking about?
He quit this job to get out of this town.
May I help you?
- An engagement?
- No.
Getting married?
What is the ring size?
Can I help you?
Your name's Megumi, right?
There's lots of Megumis, but only one who's mine.
- What are you talking about?
- Are you from here?
Manager, please.
Who was the guy who was standing here?
Get out!
The Eagles are coming!
Any of you guys ever sleep with our girls?
Then step outside!
How about you?
You?
Don't lie to me, shithead!
I'll tell you something.
I don't care what you guys do with your own people.
But if you touch ours, you'll pay! Understood?
Hey! Give me a break.
What do you mean "you'll pay"?
Ridiculous!
Now get the hell out!
You all sons of this ex-whore?
That's right.
Stop! Now, crazy bastard!
You're all so cold.
You guys just stand around and watch?
Do it till it's out of your system.
You can't kill me.
I can kill you.
It's up to you.
Ridiculous.
You know what's going on, don't you?
You're right.
It's quite ridiculous.
But I've always known since I was a kid... the time would come when I'd have to do this.
Go home and get some rest.
But pay up before you go.
Mari.
Let me go!
Idiot!
Go get Mako.
Mari!
What's all this?
This knife is perfect for killing someone.
Definitely not for children.
Mari. What a shame.
The consensus is that we should strip her and shove this knife into her.
You're screwed, Mari.
But if you guys do that, you'll be screwed, too.
We can't have that.
I'll let her go unharmed.
But from now on, you keep the fuck out of our business.
Mako, let's go.
What's wrong?
I'm going to look for Ichiro.
I'm okay.
I'll be fine on my own.
Thank you for coming to help me.
I'll never forget this.
Good-bye.
Young girls are
So very maybe sexy
So very maybe sexy
Maybe not
Look there, a yellow cherry
Go ahead, pinch it ONE.!
Go ahead, suck it TWO.!
Sweet and bitter THREE.!
ONE TWO THREE
Yellow cherry.!
Does Mari know where to look?
Do you think Mari will find Ichiro?
Who knows?
See you, take care.
Megumi.
What? Who are you?
Why are you getting it on with that guy?
It's so pathetic.
- No!
- Quiet!
Kazuma!
You've got balls.
If the Eagles saw you now, you'd be in big trouble.
I'll help you out.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Hey, sis, be quiet.
Do it.
We'll watch for you.
No.
Why not? We've gone to all this trouble for you.
Hey, where were you born?
Hokkaido.
Hokkaido?
Where'd you grow up?
In Hokkaido, the whole time.
When'd you come here?
After high school,
I came here to stay with my uncle.
I'm sorry. Wrong girl.
Shit, you're a wimp.
Pretty cool purse you got there.
Cut it out. Here.
Shit. You jerk!
What the hell's going on?
Megumi, there's a guy wants to meet you.
- Who?
- He's over by the cashier.
Megumi is a good name.
Who are you?
Who do you think I am?
What do you want?
I have too many things to ask you, but I don't know how.
I'm all nervous.
When I was seven, our mom died.
Mom's friend in Tachikawa adopted you.
Mama from "Mama Blues."
Remember the harbor in Yokosuka?
The crowds at the gate and all those flags whenever battleships came into port.
Somebody was holding your hand and you were walking in the crowd.
I've never seen a battleship.
And nobody ever held my hand.
I've been all alone since I was born.
What's that?
Blabbing on about all that bullshit.
I'm not falling for it.
Megumi.
Screw you.
Don't throw my name around.
It won't work on me.
So don't try asking me out.
Wait.
You're really not my sister?
Hell, no!
How the hell would I be related to a... a thing like you?
Go get lost! Jerk!
He's crazy.
No way I'm that bastard's sister.
- Can you take a look at my car?
- Which one?
I think it's the clutch.
I've been looking for you.
Cowards!
So many of you and only one of him.
You call that manly?
Look after him, Mako.
Kazuma, are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
They're horrible.
Thanks.
Kazuma, don't.
A Coke.
Scotch.
What?
Just like a movie, a western.
If you want a gun,
I can get one for you.
No, thanks.
Knives then?
On the rocks. A double.
Shall we just beat each other up?
No. I'll just leave town.
Yeah. You should.
I never intended to stay here long.
I'll leave as soon as
I've finished my business.
You call yourself a man?
Who you talking to?
To Kazuma.
I'll leave after my search is over.
So you'll surrender?
I don't care what you think.
But listen, Baron.
What, Kazuma?
I've got a favor to ask.
I'm looking for my sister.
Her name's Megumi.
She's 17 years old.
She's here.
But she's not the one.
I can tell.
If you find her, let me know.
Got it.
She's a half-breed, right?
Yeah.
When I find her,
I'll put you in touch.
But you know...
Too scared to finish that sentence, right?
What the...
If you do something after that, it'll be a real western.
We'll find your sister for you.
Don't. I don't want to get you into trouble.
He's right.
You'd better not, Mako.
- No clue here.
- None here either.
Let's go.
Those girls are crazy.
They're acting like his underlings.
I figured as much.
What are you gonna do?
Take 'em by force?
Ridiculous.
Long as we're at it, let's sell 'em off as a bunch and make a pile.
Hey, Chooko.
What now?
Starting a party agency?
I have no intention of intruding on your business.
I just want to have fun with a devious plan.
And I need you to handle it.
Chooko, help him get ready.
Hey, Kiko, let me see.
You've already seen it a hundred times.
Which one should I wear?
Beautiful, huh?
Okay, this is a gentleman's party, so let's be elegant and act docile.
What the hell?
You touched my ass.
You jerk!
Want your ass kicked, you letch?
You look swell, Mako.
What's all this?
We've known each other a long time.
Let's not squabble over petty details.
Don't you think?
We're friends.
As long as we help each other, we can both have a good time.
Where are the other girls?
They'll be here soon.
How about the customers?
She's beautiful.
Yeah. I like her.
Give her to Harry first.
Harry spotted her.
Yes, I did.
I should have brought Yuka and Megumi.
- Yuka doesn't like places like this.
- Me neither.
But the food's good here, so I'll stick it out.
Who's that?
No! Stop it!
What a jerk.
What the hell are you doing?
Leave her alone!
Strange party, isn't it?
Baron, where are you going?
What's going on?
You're the party pooper.
He told me to hand you over.
Hand you over.
Shit! Not to some fucking Harry!
Are you in love?
Go to hell! You old bastard!
Fuck off!
I can't lose my chastity in this cesspool!
Hey! You girls were paid in advance, so quiet!
Then where's the rest of the pay?
Hey! Get Baron!
Where are you going?
- Cut that crap now!
- Fuck you!
You've turned into that white pig's thugs!
- Yeah, well, they're paying us.
- What?
Baron.
Don't.
Baron.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Girls are all filthy. I knew it.
Can't get it up?
I'm right, aren't I?
Nobody tells me that.
Anybody who does, I kill.
If you want it so bad,
I'll take you back to the party.
Tonight's party is a rape party.
Your friends are getting gangbanged right now.
Baron, what exactly do you mean?
Because you girls helped the "Mama Blues" boys break loose.
I thought you girls might as well have real men.
You sold us?
Not you.
I didn't want them touching you.
That's why I dragged you out of there.
You sold your friends, too.
You conned me.
I never betray my friends.
But what will they think?
You're hardly yourself, Mako.
This is it, then.
You can really say that to me?
Yeah.
Being with you makes me sick!
Mako.
You're fucked.
After all, I'm reckless.
I'm just a homeless stray.
Mako,
I bought you a cool leather jacket.
I ripped it up.
Perfume, too.
Dior's Diorissimo.
Smashed the bottle.
Mako.
Are you in love with him?
You are, aren't you?
That's right.
All right.
It's not gonna be pretty.
You prepared?
Sure.
When bitches get in heat like this, they get all reckless.
'Cause I'm not like you.
I'm a decent, normal woman.
What does a decent, normal woman usually do?
Take a good look at yourself.
All you do is shake your ass and cling to men.
Baron, enough.
It's all clear now.
Hey! You're not with Baron?
I thought you left with Baron...
Goddamn it!
I can't let him fuck us over!
After all,
I've got myself to live with.
Bastard!
I'm fighting back! Our way!
What are you doing?
No! Get off me!
How long are you gonna take?
Fuck off!
Get off me! Let me go!
Who the hell are you?
- Kiko!
- Peko!
Miki!
Yuka! Get the girls! Hurry!
Miki, let's go.
Mako!
Don't fuck with us.
Hey! Get them now!
Let's go!
Fuck you!
Go!
Don't cry over this.
Damn it!
Fuck you!
I'm sorry. I was stupid.
I really didn't know.
Stand over there.
All right.
I'll spare your face.
Turn around.
Fuck you!
Piece of shit!
Damn you!
Shit!
Fuck this shit!
Fuck you!
Damn you!
Did it hurt?
Sure, a lot.
I can't find him.
I want to be here with you guys.
Bartender, a whiskey-Coke.
Baron, I go out of my way to help you, and this is how it ends up?
My reputation's shot.
Baron.
What is this town to you?
It's my playground.
Yours?
Then you clean up this mess yourself.
They're idiots!
Yeah, they are.
No fucking clue what they got themselves into.
I'll teach 'em.
Don't.
Don't touch Mako.
Mako's my woman.
No one gets involved.
Hey, Kazuma. Come along.
We've got a fun game.
We want you to come and play.
Get out.
Kazuma.
You can go now.
Better hurry.
20 seconds...
25 seconds...
30 seconds...
40 seconds...
50 seconds...
60 seconds...
There he is!
Kazuma!
Kazuma!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Bastards!
Baron, you disappoint me.
You dragged me here for this?
Kazuma, run! Kazuma!
Here she is.
I have nothing to say to him.
Megumi.
Little Megumi.
That's fine.
You're my sister.
I knew as soon as I saw your face.
Not just your face.
I'm thrilled just to see you standing there.
Let's leave this town together.
I was waiting for you to come to me and tell me the truth.
I was in an orphanage, and you were adopted.
I thought you were with Mama at "Mama Blues."
Why'd you leave her?
You didn't have to worry.
I was coming to take care of you.
Why do we have to be related?
Megumi.
We share the blood of our old man,
"Marcus Wilson," and our Mom, "Harue Okamoto," who died in Yokohama.
It's hard to tell with you, though.
No.
No way!
What's your proof?
Let go!
When you were four years old, while we were scuffling,
I accidentally poked you with a pencil.
Isn't that so?
Here, you still have the mark.
That's not true!
Get off me!
You're just a...
Megumi!
Fool!
Kazuma.
Hey, where'd our punching bag go?
My brother... isn't coming back.
What?
My brother... went far away.
You're his sister?
So you're really his sister.
That's interesting.
Let's take care of her, too.
Stop!
Susumu, why don't you take her first?
No, I don't want to.
Why not?
Hey, Baron.
We never did this shit before.
We're acting like impotent losers.
- Get off me!
- Then you can watch.
No. No.
No.
Susumu, where are you going?
You're not abandoning the Eagles, are you?
Get back there.
Turn around, Susumu.
Susumu!
Come back! Fool!
Baron.
The truth is, I'm a half-breed too.
What?
Susumu.
I didn't know you were a half-breed.
You're a half-breed, Susumu.
Susumu!
Tell Megumi...
Tell her she's cute and honest.
That I'm relieved to hear everybody say that about her.
Please, Mama-san.
Yeah, I'll tell her that for you.
So you saw her?
No.
I never found her.
I see.
You couldn't see her.
No.
I'll tell her...
I'll tell her that her brother said that, and to go back to her brother.
Megumi.
Mama!
It's okay, it's okay.
Did those bastards do this?
Mama, if Megumi comes back...
What are you saying?
She's right here.
It's okay.
Please tell her not to look for her brother.
Fool!
What the hell?
Give me a gun to shoot monkeys with!
You're here.
Toshi's already here.
Kazuma.
Sing that song of yours.
No names
No life stories between us
Not even good-byes
No questions where you live
Where you're headed
Let's shed no tears of regret
Your hair caressing my fingers
Strikes deep into my heart
We shared our briefhappiness
Our night together will soon be over
I couldn't let you go to someone else
So I committed a crime
Kazuma.
I liked you.
I wanted to sleep with you.
I wanted to go shopping with you, eat with you.
I wanted to spend time with you.
Don't you like me?
Kazuma?
Can't find him.
That's it.
Kazuma!
Who knew it'd end up like this?
Shit!
Kazuma, drop your rifle.
I don't like this.
Let's get down!
Don't shoot!
He's got a hostage.
Mako.
Me...
They're calling me out!
Baron! Watch out! Come back!
Idiot!
Baron!
Stop!
Baron.
Brother!
Brother!
Megumi, don't come!
Kazuma!
I'm not your brother!
Megumi, stay away!
Brother!
Brother!
Megumi!
Brother.
Megumi!!

Flying boats!
How beautiful!
Like a flock of cranes.
The oil merchant's here.
He's waiting.
Let him wait!
Ananga is just like me.
He loves water.
The water was so scarce where we came from.
But here,
I can swim till I get bored of it.
Can you swim under water?
I'm afraid of that...
Look!
Where is she?
She's not afraid of anything.
Don't brag!
And don't do it again!
It scares me.
Don't worry.
I live a charmed life.
When I was little, there was a cholera outbreak in my village.
Eight people of my family died, but nothing happened to me.
Do you know in how many places
I've lived since I got married?
Hariharpur, that's my husband's hometown.
Basudevpur... Bhatchala, where there was little water.
And now Natungeon.
Four places in four years.
You won't leave now, will you?
We haven't even settled yet.
Everyone's happy to have you here.
They're saying it's livelier now.
What do you mean?
You are so beautiful.
Your aspect attracts people.
You could use a good slap!
What about you?
No! Not me!
Who is that?
He works the forge.
He likes to watch.
He's like that...
And that face!
It gives you nightmares!
Hello, Moti.
- When did you get here?
- Recently.
Don't touch me now.
I would have to bathe again.
As you say...
I was talking about Bhatchaja...
And the lack of water...
Remember?
We've also talked quite a lot about you.
How is everybody?
- How are Kali and Bhanu?
- Fine.
And Bhahu's baby?
She had a girl in August, almost a month since then...
About time too! When we left, she looked ready to give birth.
Now it's your turn.
We shall celebrate it then!
When the time comes...
You know, Moti, we are very happy here.
I hope to stay happy.
Do you know how we lived in our first year of marriage?
He had to sell roots of arum lilies to buy rice.
You helped us, remember?
You brought us mangoes and other fruits.
I was happy too...
We liked having you in the village.
Why don't you stay a little longer?
You would be more than welcome.
Moti is here.
Welcome, Moti.
How much was the fish?
Sidhucharan caught eight.
So he thought it would be a good idea giving one to the Brahmin.
The garden is exuberant.
Moti, I'll give you some oil.
Do you want to have a bath?
The river crosses the small forest.
It's late...
I'll go have a chat.
Biswas is the most important man around here.
I want to talk to him about starting a school.
He has contacts.
Didn't you want to work as a doctor?
I've done that already.
This is different.
These people are simple, ignorant.
They have to be organized.
Imagine!
I'll have a school and, since I'm the only Brahmin in the village,
I shall also work as a priest.
Can you do all that?
A priest's work is not hard.
One has to follow the instructions from the Almanac.
- You know, today...
- What?
Nothing.
- Tell me!
- It's nothing.
You would laugh...
Is it funny?
I don't know.
I won't laugh.
Mokshada told me that I'm so beautiful... that I make the place happier.
Why are you looking like that?
I think she is right.
Haven't you seen me before?
Hello...
If you would let me pass...
Could you take my pulse?
Medicine requires a lot of ability, you know?
It's not like building a fountain.
It has to be practiced with a cool head.
How did you feel yesterday?
Heavy, like a rock...
And I had high temperature.
- What did you eat?
- A little bit of rice.
For God sake!
Rice won't get your temperature down.
I won't eat it anymore.
Stupid peasant!
No trace of common sense!
Take this with honey and basil juice.
Thanks a lot, sir.
- Do you have mustard seeds?
- Yes, sir.
Very good.
Send me some. I don't buy oil.
My man makes it out of the seeds.
Good day, doctor.
- Save me some palm juice.
- I'll send it tomorrow, sir.
Bring a carpet for the doctor!
It's a pretty temple.
Do you offer any guidance?
Next year, we hope...
May I offer my help, sir?
Stupid question!
If the doctor may not, then who may?
You should be more respectful!
Do you want to smoke, sir?
Idiot! Don't offer the doctor this miserable pipe!
One second. I'll bring a clean pipe from the house.
You should think before you talk.
You asked me about guiding...
Do you know anything about it?
He's an ignorant.
I meant the following...
I've decided to open a school.
I shall speak with Biswas.
I hope to see you and your sons.
A good idea.
It would be good for the children.
For children and for adults.
Here's a great pipe for you, sir!
Will you ask money for teaching?
The school can't stay open without money.
Teaching others is a reward in itself...
But I have to feed myself, so they'll pay me what they can.
Don't worry, sir.
We'll take care of everything.
After all, you are the jewel in our crown.
What' the point of a crown without a head, Sr. Biswas?
You are the head here and everyone knows that.
I agree with your school.
Let me think...
How I could keep you content...
How many do you have to feed?
Two. My wife and myself.
Ten measures should be enough for a month.
Could be.
I should also suggest that you act as our priest.
It's not a bad idea.
It was hard work learning Sanskrit.
- A lot of sleepless nights.
- True.
Very few are able to read it, let alone speak.
How could they, without study?
Did you understand me?
I'm the last man you should ask.
I haven't even gone to highschool!
The birds are calling and singing
Charming the dawn with their wings.
This is something I've learned and I still remember it.
One time five makes five.
Two times five makes ten...
Give me your hand.
I'll show it to you.
The skin is hardened by work.
It takes six months to get softer.
Bring me some tobacco... and coal from your aunt.
- What do you want?
- I came to see you, sir.
Come closer.
What's so fun?
I came from Kamdevpur, sir,
7 miles from here.
There was an outbreak of cholera close to our village.
I came to offer my prayers, so that we could be pardoned.
This is not the place to talk about that. Come to my house.
Tell your father to come tomorrow, to shave me.
It won't be easy.
Don't let us down, sir.
You are our only hope.
We must invoke kundalini;
So it'll be expensive.
We shall all contribute.
There are 70 families in the village.
Just tell us what you need.
I shall make a list.
How many dresses do you have?
Come on, tell me.
Three simple ones. No, four!
And elegant dresses?
Two.
- What would you like?
- A pretty one, with red embroidery.
You have to have it.
Will you be able to do what they are expecting?
I? Any hygiene manual contains preventive measures for cholera.
Now, the most important...
Is there a nimtree?
In the north-east?
Are you sure it's the north-east?
If you say so, sir.
It has to be.
We have to tie this ribbon to it.
And remember! Don't drink water from the river for a month.
Don't eat rancid food.
Throw the food with flies.
Have you finished the ceremony?
My name is Bhattacharji.
That one is my village.
I'm dying of hunger, sir.
The price of rice has gone up from four to six rupees.
I can't work with my bad eyesight.
I'm 69 years old.
What do you want from me?
If you could give me... something from what you've earned today... Some lentil...
The rice doesn't cost as much in my village.
They say it's because of the war...
Because the Japanese have taken Singapore.
They say the prices will go up even more.
Maybe a little bit of this...
You have no idea what you have done for me!
May I ask your name?
Ganga Charan Chakravarty.
I shall come see you some day.
I want to see you cook someday.
Do you want to learn cooking as well?
What makes your food so delicious?
This curry, for example.
What did you put in it?
Why should I tell you?
You know so much already.
Can't you leave me the cooking?
If the price of rice rises more we'll have to forget the good food.
Didn't you say that the old man was exaggerating?
Well, there is a war going on.
That's no exaggeration.
Who's fighting whom?
Our king is fighting the Japanese and the Germans.
Haven't you seen the airplanes?
Yes. I love watching them.
Well, all those planes are going to war.
How can they fly?
It has to do with mechanics.
The currents are strong in the sky.
The higher, the stronger.
Haven't you seen the comets?
How are you, Yaseen?
Fine, sir, except...
I don't have kerosene.
There's no more kerosene in the market.
You don't have at all?
It seems I shall have to petition the district magistrate.
It's unheard of!
I have money, yet nothing to buy.
Is that because of the war?
That's what they say.
I'll make provisions of rice and salt.
Will they disappear as well?
If there's nothing else, one can live with rice and salt.
We, as business men, must think ahead.
Now that this thing has started, no one knows when it'll pass.
Now I'm really worried.
Is this Mr. Chakravarty's house?
He's out.
Who are you? His wife?
Will you give me some water?
I'm a Brahmin.
I was thinking of eating here today.
This is delicious.
Can I have some more?
Fried pepper?
And chile?
Would you like some chile, birdie?
Give me the pipe.
I always light my own pipe.
This war of which we've heard...
How long will it last?
How could we know?
Wars are made by the kings.
We are commoners.
I've heard that the Germans took prisoners in Singapore.
Singapore.
Not the Germans, the Japanese.
Where is that, sir?
In Midnapur.
Is that close to Puri?
Not very far...
A little further west.
So the war is out there...
And that made the rice price soar?
It's logical.
Don't think about it.
My barn is full.
It'll be enough.
He asked for you.
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He asked for you.
I know. It's that old man.
- When did he come?
- Not long ago. He ate here.
Have you given your food?
Wasn't he a guest?
There's no more kerosene, the rice costs 8 rupees.
Be careful whom you feed!
So he has come back...
I slept very well, after a delicious lunch.
I came to ask your advice.
There's no rice where I come from.
The little rice we find... it's sold with 10 rupees.
We are not rich.
You don't have sons, do you?
You would see them, if we had.
I'm an old man, with a lot of mouths to feed.
I can ask Biswas to give you some rice.
He's the village headman.
Will I have to pay for it?
Of course.
I didn't bring any money.
Then what can we do?
There's nothing we can do about it.
So my end has come.
I shall die of hunger.
We have our own problems, you know?
Thank you, good lady.
How could you let him leave empty handed?
He didn't bring money.
He came to beg. He's a smart old man.
Please, call him back.
I can't go fetch rice for him now.
Try tomorrow.
He could spend the night here.
Come! Call him back!
The price of rice rises with each day.
Do you know the true reason for such high prices?
The Japanese have taken Burma.
- And Singapore?
- That too.
But now, they also have Burma.
Do you remember the long-grain rice that came from Burma?
You can't find it anymore.
And the worst is...
The authorities are confiscating our rice.
What for?
For the army. The army's strength comes from a full belly, right?
It doesn't matter... if useless people like me die of hunger.
Of course, you have your work...
The school, your religious tasks...
Yes, I'm very busy
What can I do at my age?
And do many depend on me...
You are the only Brahmin in this village, right?
The only...
Can you see the future?
My work is very exhausting.
What's with that look?
I'm trying to see if it's true.
I think it is.
In Chhutki's house, they rinse the rice.
They are paying one part of rice for nine rinsed parts.
And so what?
Can't I do it as well?
Not now.
Only if things get worse.
You are Brahmin. How could you work with an inferior caste?
Does it matter?
What do you know of this work?
It's not that hard.
I could learn.
When the bean goes up, you push the grains under;
When the bean goes down, you withdraw your hand.
Easy, right?
Show me your hands.
Do you know how much they respect us?
We can't lower ourselves in front of them.
Don't worry.
I shall find rice.
And if the price keeps rising?
How much could it rise, after all?
Once the war is over, everything will go back to normal.
It can't last too long.
Even the battle of Kurukshetra ended in 18 days.
God's willing, it'll end soon enough.
Yes, but you shouldn't feel sorry for any old man...
Move, will you?!
There's a little for everyone.
How much is it?
18 rupees.
It was 16, ten days ago.
I can't even go close enough.
He paid for his rice!
Mind your own business!
What are you doing sitting here?
He's been attacked at the grain market in Kundu.
We are living horrible times.
These last three days, we've only eaten rice found on field.
The young ones are the most difficult.
We can endure with less, but they refuse to do so.
What's in your baskets? Rice?
They are asking 20 rupees for it.
How much did you pay for rice?
- What rice?
- That rice that you brought.
The bag is empty.
What is this?
I worked with the others.
If we have to be humiliated, we'd better be humiliated together.
The price of rice keeps rising.
There's no rice in the market.
What about rice water?
Who are these people, Chhutki?
They're from the other district.
There's no food there, so they come here to beg.
It's terrible.
We don't have rice either.
What can we do?
Do you want some Shushni leaves?
Are you eating those?
If there's nothing else...
Don't you have rice?
My husband sold our rice when the price rose.
Now, we are eating whatever we find.
Shushni leaves...
Snails from the pond..
Aren't those for the ducks?
How do you cook the snails from the pond?
People like you can't eat that.
Tell me, anyway!
You make curry with them.
How can you say such things?
They've seen how much rice I've got.
So little rice won't be of any use.
If you don't help us, we'll die of hunger.
How can I give you more than I have?
You've seen with your own eyes how much rice I've got.
Have you thought about what will happen to us?
How is the barn?
We can only see what he shows us.
He has given us so little.
How can it be empty?
What about the rice harvested in July?
Anyone who eats that rice will get cholera.
It'll only be good for eating when the winter dries it.
You are a Brahmin, sir.
I don't dare refuse you.
Have five portions.
What are you doing here?
I was waiting for you.
Come to the forge. I'll be there.
Get out of my way!
I'll make it worth your while...
Let me go or I'll scream.
- For whom is this?
- Don't you know it?
It's for you.
Then give it to me.
Come with me... to the old shack
No one goes there, no one will know.
I'll give you rice every time we go there.
How dare you say that?
Get out of my way!
If Biswas acts like this what can we do?
They threw themselves at his feet...
Yet he swears he has no more rice.
Where is everything?
What will happen?
Do you know what's the problem?
The peasants are doing all the work.
We only take advantage.
This is wrong.
If we could only have our own land...
Can't we find rice elsewhere?
There must be somewhere!
I've heard that, some 12 miles from there...
In the village Sankanpore, there's a man who has rice.
His name is Ghosh.
Will you go?
The rice costs 30 rupees
I only make 13 rupees a month.
How much can I buy?
But we have money.
Wouldn't that be enough?
We'll use it, if you promise not to starve yourself.
It doesn't help to eat too much.
Lately I don't have much of an appetite.
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything will be fine.
If you don't get better,
I'll give you some medicine.
Are you sure that there are wild potatoes here?
It looks like a jungle of tigers!
Don't worry.
We'll find something.
There are a lot of thorns here.
They caught me twice.
Who told you about the wild potatoes and about the pond snails, Chhutki?
Your fiancée?
Where does Mr. Ghosh live?
I wouldn't lie to a Brahmin.
I have rice, but not for sale.
- You don't sell it?
- No, sir.
I've already refused ten people this morning.
But I walked 12 miles to get here.
I'm sorry, but the rice is not for sale.
I can give you money for it
I can't eat your money.
If I sell my rice, what can I buy?
Well.. I suppose I'll have to go.
You are a Brahmin, sir.
Please, eat before you leave.
I'll give you rice for diner.
If you can give me rice, can't you give me a little more for my family?
I'm sorry, but I can only give you enough for one diner.
Have a bath, first, sir.
We shall catch a fish for you and we'll give you fresh milk.
You will eat well before you start your journey back.
My daughter will look after you.
There are a lot of thorns.
I'm sorry. I'm coming.
You shouldn't have come.
I told you we would give you a part of what we find.
It's not very amusing to be sad inside your house.
Don't you rub the fish with salt and turmeric?
I forgot.
You don't usually cook, do you?
In fact, I don't...
May I help you?
Let me tell you how to do it.
Why don't you eat?
Are you sick?
Is it for someone in your house?
She only thinks about me.
Never about herself...
Please, eat your food.
When you leave, hide amongst those bamboo trees.
I'll give you some rice for her.
If you need rice again, come to me.
I'll give you what I can.
Give me the lever.
I'm caught by the thorns again.
Go ahead! I'll follow you.
Flying boats!
I can't see them because of the trees.
Let's leave this place!
Bring the potato.
Get some rest. We'll be back.
Don't tell anybody.
Nobody talks about these things.
Chhutki talks sometimes.
True. I like to gossip.
But never about you!
Have you had a bath?
What happens?
What happened?
I brought rice.
Please, give us rice for our families.
If you don't have rice, where should we go?
There's nothing in the barn.
See for yourselves!
For two days now, we haven't eaten a thing...
Take half of mine, then!
We shall starve together.
What are you saying, sir?
Here are the keys.
Open the barn for them!
We know that there's no rice in there.
Where is it, then?
You hid it.
Why would I hide my own rice?
Devil take me if I'm lying!
Believe me! I have no rice.
I've been thinking...
- Where is the rice?
- I have it.
I shall show you.
Wait here.
It cost me a great deal to get it.
Only for you!
Don't start with that again!
I swear it's true!
How did you burn your face?
Not just my face... Look!
It was during the Festival of Kali.
Fireworks exploded in my face.
You have a happy life, don't you?
What is it?
What are you doing?
The lamp shall burn until it'll be put out.
Then, I shall live in darkness.
Do you want some rice?
Where did you get it?
Where have you been?
You know.
I don't. Tell me.
At the forge.
Don't you have a husband?
I'm so hungry that I can't think of anything else.
That disfigured man has been after me since we came here.
You know that you'll have to pay for this..
Do you want rice?
You eat it! I shan't touch that.
Then starve!
Thieves!
Everything is gone.
Did they take everything?
Did they find the sacks that we had hidden?
No, father. They are all there!
The birds are singing and chirping and you are still in bed.
I can't live here any longer.
They've almost killed me...
For a handful of rice...
Please, examine my father.
I see you've been hit in the head.
The thieves tried to kill me.
Don't yell!
- How is he?
- He is too weak.
Please! Cure me quickly!
I must run away!
This time, I got away, but tomorrow they'll catch me.
How can I heal you quickly?
You can do it, if you wish.
I'll pay you!
Ten portions of rice.
Shall I bring it?
Not now. Too risky.
At nightfall.
Lack of food, national catastrophe, famine...
Someone fell on the roadside.
By the banyan tree;
There's someone you know.
Moti! How dreadful you look!
Come home! It's not far.
Don't touch me.
You would have to bathe.
Can't you get up?
I don't have the strength.
Did you walk all the way here?
There's no one left in the house.
How long since your last meal?
I'll bring you something.
Rice, curry fish...
I'll bring you food.
Where is the cart?
I'll come back quickly.
Don't be late.
Here's water and food.
Fish and curry...
No one has seen fish in months.
Here's some arum root.
Arum root...
Eat this. I'll be back!
You are a good woman.
Bless me, so that I shall never go hungry, not even in hell.
- Where are you going?
- To town.
Why?
To eat.
Untouchable, even in death...
The jackals will come...
I have to do something...
I have to do something to have her cremated.
You don't care, do you?
Come here.
I think that is the old man...
And his relatives
I think they're coming this way.
What will we do?
Well...
We shall be ten instead of two.
Eleven.
Eleven?
More than 5 million people died of starvation and illness in Bengal... in what came to be known as... the Bengal famine of 1943.
ORCHESTRA REHEARSAL
Come on, try for yourself
The acoustics are excellent
Did you know that it used to be an oratory?
Those are the tombs of three Popes and seven bishops
This place is full of dead people
In 1781...
...the oratory became an auditorium...
...for vocal and instrumental concerts
It was the envy of all the courts in Europe
And do you know why?
Because of its acoustics
Did you hear that? The sound is clear and there is no echo...
It's ideal for listening to music...
...without the reverberation of sound
On that rostrum stood the greatest orchestra directors
It was a big achievement for them
What musicians, what an audience!
Ministers, ambassadors and clergymen used to come here
They would bring their own music sheets...
...so that they could follow the concert
There were so many beautiful women wearing elegant, low-cut dresses
Are you playing tricks on me?
The air was filled with such a nice perfume
Nowadays the audience is very different
I am probably boring you with all this talking
I have set everything up
It looks nice, doesn't it?
I am only the copyist,
I count for nothing
One more year...
...and then I can retire
I will only come back to attend concerts
That I will do.
I couldn't live without music
Good morning, everyone
I hear a television crew is here today to make a documentary on our orchestra
Here we are, in this wonderful auditorium...
...which was built in the 13th century and used to be a church
You can see here some very old tombs and to my right...
I have already told them this
- I am the first violin and...
- Good morning
- Good morning
- Good morning, Mirella
Can someone take this cover off?
- It's really heavy
- Let me help you
- Thank you. How are you?
- Not bad
Listen, there is a television crew but try to act normal
I would like to know what they do with these chairs
Look at them, they are so dirty and filthy
Here we go again
I have a sauna at 4:00.
I won't miss it for anything
There are about 30 different poses - snake, lion, diamond...
But it's all about mind work
Where's the panettone?
Take your time, there's no rush
- You're doing fine
- He looks worse than the last time
- It's nice to have you back
- You seem to be doing well. Slowly
I want to make a bet with him.
In four months time...
I want to tell you about my uncle Quintilio...
...who for 60 years lived life to the full
He was the biggest eater, drinker and lover...
...then one morning he fell ill.
We thought he wouldn't make it
Do you know how old he is now? 93
He eats and drinks like he used to and reads without glasses. He's immortal
The name of one of Werther's sons...
It starts with 'G '
You wouldn't believe how rude people can be
- Are you talking about yourself?
- The traffic light was green...
...and the person in front of me wouldn't let me through, so I kindly asked him...
..."Can you let me through?
I am going to a rehearsal"
He looked at me as if I was a piece of shit and said...
..."Why do you need to rehearse? I can tell straight away that you are a twerp"
Are you listening to football? I'm not going to today, I get too anxious
- What does your barometer say?
- Let's see what my loyal friend says
- Shall we dare taking your violin out?
- It's 15 percent higher
- Are you not going to play?
- It may not be good for my violin
How is the leech today?
It's a tough battle. There's no escape from leeches, they lie in wait
Bastards
You keep laughing at me and making jokes about leeches
Don't get upset, it's not good for you
Neurosis really is a leech.
We will all fall victims
They may have paid 800 million lira for him, but isn't he worth twice as much?
- What's that?
- It's a tranquiliser
- That should make you feel better
- I've tried them all, they don't work
If anything, they make things worse
- What's wrong with this trumpet?
- Watch this
You idiots!
Do you really think "81/2" is a psychoanalytic film?
Go back to school!
What is this guy doing? How am I supposed to play? Hey, Mr Barometer
Get up and put your chair back to where it was. I need room to play
I am sorry but I am too close to the music stand like this. I can't read
- It has to stay here
- Are you kidding me?
It has to stay here
I even asked if you minded
I've forgotten my glasses
- I'm not here to do favours, but to play
- It has to stay here
- I want it there!
- And I want it here!
- That's your place and this is my place
- Mind how you talk! You're offending me
- There!
- What's wrong with him?
- Stop it! I said stop it!
- No, you stop it!
Gentlemen, please.
May I have your attention?
We have a very special guest.
Television
The crew and the directors are here...
...to film the rehearsal of our orchestra
They also want to interview some of you
They'd better not, or I will tell them everything
- What would you tell them?
- For instance, that you take money
As agreed with your trade union representative, in return for this...
...you will receive nothing
We haven't agreed to this
Mr Trincia, this is extra work
It's extra work!
- Who said it's extra work?
- No way!
We don't agree
In theory we could do it, but according to trade-union rules it's unacceptable
This is the ongoing problem with television
Your trade union representative is here
Calm down. Gentlemen, calm down
What do you mean?
We are already underpaid...
...and now television doesn't want to pay us at all?
I think people who are interested in music...
...will enjoy seeing how you work behind the scenes
Since this is going to be made into a programme...
...television should give us something in return
Nobody has to do it
If you want to do it, you can, and if you don't want to do it, that's fine
This is not fair
Let me just tell you something
- What better opportunity...
- What kind of trade unionist are you?
You are just a bunch of stupid empty heads
I had a terrible dream.
There was a horse in my bedroom
It sounds terrible, however it depends on the colour of the horse
- Nice dress
- Idiots!
Do you want to interview me as well?
Well, I have it all written down
Some of the things are his suggestions
- Are they going to pay us?
- A piano is like a king on his throne
It doesn't move. Cecco told me this
You have to go up there, take a bow and push the seat closer
It's like a huge mythological animal.
He also said this
It makes you feel uneasy
A room with a piano in it becomes the piano room
- It is best suited to a royal court
- I once played at court
- What did you say?
- I was saying that I once played at court
- Where?
- Before king Vittorio Emanuele III
And he didn't have you arrested?
I don't want a piano
I mean, I have my own piano but I don't want it
- Really?
- Because all pianos are the same
- Interesting
- Playing just on your piano is limiting
- It's like having brakes on
- Brakes?
I believe that...
...to be fulfilled one needs to know...
...different people and have more opportunities to meet up...
Stop making me laugh
OK, I am from Marina di Pisa...
...but I studied flute in California
There it's played more gently than here
The flute is a delicate instrument
It's the instrument that is closest to the human voice
Although the same is said about the cello and the saxophone...
...and perhaps even about the drums!
The funny thing is that a good chorus is never compared to an instrument
Only the flute sounds like a human voice
What a mysterious sound.
Supernatural!
It can tame wild animals, what more do you want?
Didn't Apollo used to wake up the dead with the flute?
It can do so many things, it's magical
The sun and the moon, day and night
Hasn't the doctor told her that flautists are all mad?
Yes, it's true. That's what people say
Perhaps with all this blowing...
...eventually air gets into their heads, poor flautists!
Everyone always expects them to do something strange. I don't know why
The trombone is a unique instrument
It has a deep, almost reprimanding voice. But it can also be funny
Just think of circus clowns spraying water and blowing raspberries
- It's also the angels' instrument
- That's true
Have you noticed that angels play the trombone in Renaissance paintings?
Wouldn't it be nice to be greeted by God at the sound of trombones?
The sound of a trombone is like the voice of a solitary creature
I like listening to it when I am by the seaside...
...during the winter, and there is nobody around
- Yours was a TV show-style ending
- I have nothing to say
I was looking at that spider line up there
Can you see it?
It must be five or six metres long
While the brass was playing, it was swinging back and forth
- Look, Lo Cucco. Can you see it?
- What do you want?
- Can you see the spider?
- What?
It's hanging there. Come over this side, you may be able to see it better
Can you see it? Isn't it sweet that we're here to make a spider swing?
Look, Esposito. Look for yourself
That little spider earlier, while the brass was playing...
- Can we interrupt you for a moment?
- Of course
- I have a frivolous question to ask you
- Go ahead
Is it true that instruments don't always get on with each other?
Yes, it's true.
Some get along and some don't
Percussion gets along with double bass...
...because they both beat time accurately...
...instead of performing arpeggios and elaborate moves
Pianos are very talkative, while violins go on and on about it
In Italy, you don't hear rhythmic music a lot. We're more into singing
Only Neapolitans can feel the beat.
They're among the best percussionists
Where is tarante//a from? Naples
I'd also like to say that in an orchestra, percussionists are the nicest...
...funniest and most friendly of musicians
What Claudio is saying is true...
...because the air of superiority...
...and the condescending voice that a violinist or a flautist can have...
...is something you will never see in this orchestra
If you let a good-for-nothing join the orchestra, what is he going to play?
The cymbals and the drums, because they are playful and joyful instruments
When the director is upset, we cheer him up by playing a bit
When people are feeling low, this lifts their spirit
I don't want to be interviewed. I don't like to have my pictures taken...
...as people could mistake me for someone else. No way
My colleague perhaps...
- Excuse me?
- Yes
- Would you answer some questions?
- You don't deserve it
It's unfair that you are not paying us but since you're here, let's hear them...
I don't know what to ask you.
Tell me about the cello
The cello is one of the key instruments in an orchestra. We could say this
Violins and cellos...
...are the basis for writing any symphony
Everything revolves around them, am I wrong?
- Yes!
- Let me tell you what violins are
The first violin is the mind and the heart of an orchestra, don't forget this
And the clarinet is the willy!
I think a cello...
...is very much like a best friend
It's a true friend
Discreet and loyal, unlike a violin
A violin may seduce you and fascinate you...
...but it's deceitful, like a woman
He's talking rubbish
My colleague over there doesn't agree
- No, nothing
- Don't you agree?
- No
- Why?
Because we think the violin is the most manly instrument of the orchestra
No, the violin is female because it's always trying to seduce us
If you want me to play along,
I will say that the violin is male...
...because it's vibrant and phallic
- I agree with my dear colleague
- Thank you
The violin is not female
It's not a languid and weak instrument.
The violin is vibrant and modern
At music school, it's the youngest students who want to enrol...
- The cello makes a melancholy sound
- The first violin is the real star
I was just saying that the first violin is the real star of the orchestra
When there happens to be a director who slows down the pace...
...doesn't hit the opening bar and lacks authority...
...we are the first to notice it, as soon as he steps on the rostrum...
...and raises his baton
In that case, it's the first violin who takes the lead
He conducts the orchestra...
...and replaces the director
Nonetheless...
Who does the orchestra director shake hands with at the end of the concert?
With the first violin
Do you know what I said once to a director?
You like the brass too much. You are a bandmaster, that's what you are!
What has this got to do with what we were saying? I'm sorry
Going back to the cello,
I just want to say this
It's an instrument that will never betray you
Once it's chosen you, it will always stay by your side
- Idiot!
- The double bassoon
- Only good for the circus!
- I just want to say...
...that I owe everything to the cello.
It's helped me find my identity
- True
- What do you mean?
It has helped me smooth my rough edges
- Do you want to interview me?
- Why not?
- Shall I go over there?
- Here is fine
My seat is over there
Comb your hair, there will be women watching you on TV
Of course
The clarinet has allowed me escape...
...the fog of my home town,
Gazolto, in the north of Italy
From the end of August until April of the following year you can't see it
The bell tower disappears and so does the school...
- What has this...
- I'm getting there
As a clarinet player,
I travelled around the world...
...and even met the great Toscanini...
...who said to me,
"Well done, young man.
"At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
These are his exact words
"Well done, young man.
At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
- What did you say?
- What can you say?
When Toscanini tells you...
..."Well done, young man.
At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
I wasn't paying attention, what did he say?
He said, "Well done, young man.
At last I hear a nice clarinet sound"
- Who was playing the clarinet?
- It was me
As I said, it's a fascinating and wonderful instrument
Not to mention its musical potential, which is extraordinary
The trumpet allows you to make the most amazing musical acrobatics
But what's really unique is that...
...it enables you to express what you have inside
Happiness, sadness, silence...
What? Who?
Claudio, come and talk to this guy
Shut up,
I'm being interviewed
Perhaps all three of us were wrong
The trumpet is like a passport that enables me to travel...
...to a new world
Those who play the trumpet know what I mean
It's a world of fulfilment, where everything is more intense
There are plenty of us and we play the trumpet all together
Mazzieri, tell them that trumpet players have to study more than anybody
- Speak up. What did you say?
- Our lips are cracked
My colleague is right. We have to spend hours moistening our lips...
...to soften them before we can play
The degree of approximation allowed for other instruments...
...is not given to the trumpet
Do you mean the strings don't have to be as accurate? Shut up!
If you play the wrong note with a trumpet, you're finished
It's got me ill. I can't sleep anymore and I have high blood pressure
I've become a sleepwalker
Once I was playing the trumpet in my pyjamas outside my front door
I'm paranoid that
I'm going to make a mistake
- We did have some work
- Let me speak to him
Hey, article nine!
Use your gramophone for the concert!
That will teach you to negotiate with your staff
I am your staff!
I am their trade union representative and I am happy to be interviewed
We have managed to free musicians from their servile status
We have given musicians their dignity back
They are no longer pieceworkers or puppets in the hands of a director...
...or an intermediary, but workers who are fulfilled and aware of their role
How did we succeed at such a difficult task?
We safeguarded their professional status...
...by making a number of demands...
...such as fair salaries...
- You abolished mafia middlemen
- You can tell them about this later
Through a restructuring of orchestra staff, as I was saying
Hey!
- You don't get it, do you?
- What shall I do with him?
- There's a mouse!
- It's over there!
Behind the painting! Over there!
- There it is!
- It's huge!
Shall I kill it?
- There it is, it's over there!
- Look at it!
- Don't kill it
- Take the broom
- Give it to me!
- Careful!
They're going to open the sewer if they keep wrecking this place
I've got fire! Let me through
Let's burn it. Throw it in there
Watch out, it's coming towards you!
Catch it!
Bloody hell, it's fighting back!
It's biting!
At last!
- I don't want to see it!
- Let's cook it, it'll make a nice meal
Stop it. Throw it away!
You are disgusting! Throw it away
Go back to your seats!
We should have put a mouse in his trumpet
- Back to your seats, the director is here
- He would've had a hard time playing it!
Do you know that my wife's uncle ate a mouse during the war
Regards!
This is terrible. I am sorry but I haven't got time for this now
Can you turn that light off?
I know you have permission to film but I don't agree with it
- Oboe...
- My feet are cold
I've left my slippers at home
Why are you so interested in a rehearsal?
This is like a factory or at least that's how it should be...
...where we try to make something
What are we trying to make now?
We are trying to make something but
I don't know what it is or what it's for
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to carry on
We'll talk later
Turn off that light, please
Strings. Only the strings, please
Please!
What's wrong?
Have you been arguing?
Is that why everyone is going their own way?
Aren't you all part of the same team?
- No, we're not!
- Why do you bother replying?
Ready...
Stop. Stop!
Play gracefully, this is not a fun fair!
Passionately but gently.
You are playing violins not trumpets!
Scheise Flute, it's an E flat not an E natural
- Here it says E natural
- It's an E flat. Look Carefully
- It's really an E natural
- Then change it!
Isn't it strange that you always get all the copyist mistakes?
Clarinet...
No
It should be delicate and gentle
What are you laughing at?
It's not funny!
I find this passage very funny
I don't think the composer wanted it to sound humorous
- There's no reason to laugh
- Listen
Even my colleague is laughing
- It's really funny
- You are so funny. Look at your face
I am going to send you four clarinets
I know you need one but you have to take four
I'll tell you later
- Who scored?
- Couldn't I stay in California?
Look at her!
Where are we? On a football pitch?
Have you mistaken me for a referee?
Too loud! Too penetrating!
You should all be castrated!
He's right. The brass was loud
You are unbelievable!
Pick up those sheets
I am going to send you a guy called Ciccio Calamina
He is not a musician but you have to take him on because the minister...
What did he think he was doing?
He wanted us to take a break.
Good on him
Do you remember that crazy guy at
San Carlo who threw his watch at me?
Tomorrow morning, all right?
If it's 400 then I'll give you 20
OK, so on Sunday at Torvaianica.
Take your son with you. Bye
- Come on, let's do Gallop number 15
- Here it is
Stop! Are the strings intimidating you or do you have low blood pressure?
Let's start from the beginning
Stop! Oboe, you are too loud!
You are not the only one here
From the beginning
Stop! You are tickling that string
You have to cut it with your bow. Saw it!
Can I ask you all a question?
Do you understand why you're here?
I'm talking to musicians, right?
I want to hear a compact sound.
Let's start from the beginning
Carry on like this!
Come on!
I can't see where you are!
Bass, louder!
Don't lag behind! Come on!
Get moving!
Come on!
Exactly! Louder! Yes!
Four, five, six, attention!
Can Toscanini's favourite...
...be so kind as to repeat on his own...
...four measures after number 82?
No, I won't.
I have already played twice
To play a third time is to go against our union agreement
My colleague is right
A passage should be played by everyone or not played at all
It's like being back at school.
We are all adults here
If I were you, I'd think less about the union and more about the music
I insist
If Wagner had known about trade unions and strikes...
...he would have never written this opera
Now it's the trade unions' fault if he can't write anything good
I miss not having peace and quiet
My life is shit
You should spread it on your baton...
...and then lick it off
Let's start from measure 330.
Flugelhorn, please
- What was it?
- Flugelhorn
Where is the flugelhorn?
- He's not here
- What do you mean?
I don't know. He's not here
60 and 40...
- He couldn't make it. Why?
- What do you mean?
- Why are you only telling me this now?
- Let me explain
It's not that he couldn't come.
He didn't want to come
As a gesture of protest and in agreement with the union Bentivoglio belongs to
Who is going to play the flugelhorn?
The sister?
Leave my sister alone and let's not bring family into this
- I didn't say...
- I have good hearing
I didn't say, "Your sister". I said,
"The sister", meaning the guy's sister
Maybe I don't have enough of a sense of humour but I don't find this funny
You carry on doing your job...
...and leave our families to us
- Let's carry on. 530, please
- I don't think so
No, not now.
The musicians are quite tired
I am sorry but I don't think they can carry on rehearsing
Bloody hell.
What do you want from me?
Do you want to drive me crazy?
What do you want?
Do you want my arse?
Here it is!
You can all have a 20-minute break!
I think the director is quite good.
A bit hysterical but within the limits
- There are some who...
- We no longer need directors like him
All we need is a metronome
At concerts, the audience should sit with us...
...that way the music would sound very different
There is a difference between watching a battle at the cinema and fighting it
Noble, ascetic, restless, authoritative...
...and charismatic, this is how a director should be
Some are mystic, priest like, acrobatic
While some act like lion tamers
He used to play the harp, the violin, the percussions, the bass drum...
...and even the bassoon.
He was so funny!
When you are in front of the camera, you start chatting away...
I want my teacher to watch me from up there
If he doesn't look at me,
I get jealous
Are you filming?
We are the /i/ies of the garden,
we are Romans...
Friendship is a different thing
First of all, we never meet up outside work
In the morning, you have rehearsals, you clock in
- When you leave, you clock out
- Like in a factory
Me? I thought I was going to travel the world playing this instrument
- Instead, I'm always here
- Let's hear it
I can't stand this noisy, fat thing anymore
It makes me feel worthless
An orchestra could easily do without it.
What's the point in having it?
And it's dangerous! A real calamity
You try so hard to make some nice music...
...but all you get is a loud fart
I think it symbolises...
...dullness and close-mindedness
That's true
In an orchestra, it's the kind of instrument that cannot...
...integrate with the others
Most musicians come from the provinces
What provinces?
I come from a big city, Afragola
The truth is that most musicians have a very modest...
...academic background
We don't have any real interests.
We're into nothing
We spend our lives glued to our instruments...
...whether they are wind or string ones
I wonder why he's chosen music
I just want to say this.
All these talks...
...about trade unions, orchestral leaders, politics...
...brass, strings, this or that director...
None of this matters to me
Why? Because
I can't get it up anymore
Now, that's the real problem, not the trade unions!
You keep drinking. It will do a lot of good to your brain and liver!
It's not whiskey. It's only a bit of white wine to cheer myself up
A little wine does no harm, if it's of good quality
It's whiskey.
I saw her filling up the bottle
Plus I can smell it from here.
Do as you like
Everyone has their little vices
It's better to drink a little than to sleep with young girls
One of these days you'll end up in the papers
Whiskey is not so bad!
I didn't choose the bass tuba
It's the bass tuba that chose me
I wanted to play the trumpet, which has always given me goose bumps
Do you remember when we were doing military service on ships?
I used to get emotional too, but as soon as it was over I would take off
I am very sensitive
Art makes me cry
And I'll tell you something else
- Sometimes I want to die
- Why do you want to die?
Because the world has become a nasty place
I want to be reunited with my dad
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's true
Then let's talk about my instrument
The fact that nobody wanted it touched me
Poor bass tube. It was there on its own, like a stray dog
I thought it looked a bit like me
Sad and Ionely, like me
Clumsy and fat, just like me
I thought the two of us should be together. And that's what happened
It was a good idea, we are meant for each other
Now I can't stay away from it.
We are friends
When I feel down, the two of us sit by the window...
...Iook at the moon...
...and play a solo by Verdi
Do you want to hear it?
I don't mind
Yes, maybe just a little bit
With music, everyone hears what they want to hear
Sound is subjective. For example, an F sharp or a B flat...
...played by any instrument can sound very moving to some...
...while others may hate them
It may well happen
What an amazing instrument the oboe is
It's the oldest one, you know?
It was invented by the Chinese...
...and it's the most difficult...
...and most delicate and the most solitary one
The oboes are isolated, envied...
...and disliked
Because the orchestra has to answer to the oboe
It's the oboe that lays down the law
It's the oboe...
...that sets the pitch range
It's because of this privilege that the violin hates the oboe
And, as you would expect...
...the oboe hates the violin
- Well...
- It's an instrument...
...that enables spiritual elevation
Those who play it...
...develop special powers
It's like an inner eye...
...that enables you to see the colours of sound
When I play, I see...
...a bright, golden aura...
...the same colour as the sun
It's like a huge reverberation
It's true, you know? Once I saw...
...something that looked like a banner
Look, his hands are shaking
- It's an extraordinary experience
- Andy, play...
- Would you like to hear it?
- Of course
If you don't mind...
Excuse me, Sir
Just a moment.
He's having a shower
With the previous director...
...musicians wouldn't take things so lightly
First of all, they would all wear a tie
Nobody was allowed to show up without a tie
Now they would even take footbaths while playing
They also had a rule
Those who went out of tune or didn't come in at the right time...
...had to play standing up...
...until the end of the rehearsal, as punishment
What shifts? What working hours?
They had to rehearse all night long
Do you know how many dawns
I have seen?
At dawn, the musicians, though exhausted...
...would applaud the director...
...and thank him
He was a genius
He would conduct with his eyes closed, as if he was in a trance
Instead, he was very alert
I don't know how he did that
When he wanted to tell a musician off for making a mistake...
...he would find words that would kill you...
...that would make you feel bad for a month
He used to give terrible blows with his baton...
...on the hands of the musicians who had made mistakes
You could hear so much hissing!
Well, do you want to know something?
They were happy...
...to be punished
They would come forward like schoolchildren
They would open their hands and say...
..."I have made a mistake"
"So have I!
I too have made a mistake!"
Those were different times
- Can you see what he is doing?
- What is he doing?
RUBBISH DIRECTOR...
- Guess!
- Do you think this is acceptable?
It probably is!
- I don't know anymore
- Zuanelli!
Here we go
The people from TV are here
Do you want to know if music is part of the world?
I would like to ask you if music exists
No? Then the world doesn't exist
Only habits are left
You can go
What role does music have these days?
Do you really think the audience knows what music is?
They think they are clever just because they feel butterflies in their stomach
Beethoven makes everyone feel like a knight in shining armour
I can almost picture them picking up their chairs and running away
When I am conducting, I feel stupid
It's as if I was dead.
I feel like a ghost
I didn't mean to say that.
Please cut it out
Nowadays you have to be optimistic all the time
I have to be clever
So let's say that the music is the world
When I am conducting, I feel like the world's leader, like a king
Do you really want to know how I feel?
I feel like a sergeant major who kicks people in the backside all the time
Although these days the law forbids you to behave like a sergeant
I am sure we have taken advantage of our privileged position
Excuse me, I need a drink
This is not even chilled
There is no ice in the bucket
There is a fine line between talent and eccentricity
For example, once I asked a musician to take her ring off...
...because the reflection of the light on the stone was bothering me
Everyone thought I was throwing a tantrum and behaving like a diva
It may well be, but it's the eccentricity...
...that enables an artist to have the ability...
...to enthral and lead everyone
Cheers
But now the key role of the director is criticised
Musicians...
I don't even look at them
I must say that sometimes I can't stand their faces
If I could, I would put a screen in front of some of them
They look like ferocious dogs...
...staring at me
It's best to cut this out...
...or they will shoot me in the legs
The golden era is over
I remember the first time
I stepped on a rostrum
The thing that hit me most...
...was the complete silence
At the start signal...
...I realise that my baton...
...is connected with the orchestra
Its voice originates from my hand
The baton draws the orchestra out of silence...
...and then back to it
The sound rises like a sea wave...
...when I lift my arm and move it in the air like a wing...
...and when I lower it...
...the sound fades
Now we are all equal
I have to be like the first violin, who has fingers like a butcher
What do I do about it?
I release my anger...
...and buy houses
I have two in the States...
...one in Tokyo, one in London and one in Berlin
But not in Paris
I don't want to have one there because I don't like French music
I think that's why at customs at Orly...
...I get searched from top to bottom, front and back
You've got your interview now, are we finished? I am going to go
Orchestra conductor...
This word doesn't mean anything anymore
An orchestra conductor is like a priest
He needs to have a church and parishioners
When the church collapses...
...and the parishioners become atheists...
I remember Koplensky, my great teacher...
At the time, I was the first violin
When he stepped on the rostrum, everyone was silent
He would glace over the music sheets with an absent-minded look
He knew them inside out
He was the music
We followed him with joy and fear...
...through a ritual of transubstantiation...
...turning wine into blood...
...and bread into flesh
Are you laughing at me?
I hope not
Music is always sacred
Every concert is like a mass
We used to sit there in amazement
We would forget about everyday worries
As we were waiting for his baton to move...
...we were one with our instruments
We were united by a vital force
Then we would start
There was nothing more beautiful than his authority
We used to tremble...
...at the thought...
...that one mistake could spoil the entire ritual
It was very emotional
It was sheer joy
We felt as if our joy...
...could be conveyed to the audience...
...who was quiet and still
We never used to look at the conductor. We didn't need to
He was there and we knew that.
We could feel it
He was inside us
There was a close relationship between the conductor and the musicians
Not anymore though, as you can see
There is only mistrust between me and my musicians
We are all against each other.
Our wariness undermines our trust
Then there is contempt, resentment...
...and anger for something that has gone and will never come back
That's how we play together...
...united only by hatred...
...like a broken family
I don't know what's happened but we have no electricity
- I can see that
- What shall we do?
What do you mean? The break is over.
We will carry on rehearsing
- But...
- Come on, let's go
Lead the way
Conductor, we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting, we will make you very sore
Conductor, we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting, we will make you very sore
Conductor, we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting, we will make you very sore
- Claudio!
- What?
You have to do something!
- Now I'll target the other eye!
- What are you doing?
Listen!
We don't want you anymore!
We won't let you conduct
We were stupid to spend all that time studying
We spent all our life at music school
You're right
There's no need for a conductor, no need for music, no need for nothing!
Let's throw everything out of the window
Music should be a public good...
...that everyone can enjoy, regardless of their social class
- Instead it's used to exploit us
- How did it happen?
Conductor, we don't want you anymore...
...if you carry on conducting, we will make you very sore
You're mad. What are you doing?
- Darling
- You drive me crazy
You're all sweaty
- What is this stuff coming down?
- What's going on up there?
You're ignorant and are acting in bad faith!
- Traitor!
- You signed it too!
I'm going to report you to the union!
I'll do it straight away!
We say no to exploitation!
Music is a chain of exploitation!
We must break it!
We must break it!
Hey, take a look
What's on my head?
I felt something
What do you want from me?
Are you looking for trouble?
What do you want? It's raining!
I will not tolerate being provoked
What's this guy doing?
Look what some people can do!
He insists!
Do you want another one?
Another one?
We say no the baton!
No more conductors! We want our music and we want it now!
You are nothing to me! Who is he?
I am asking you, who is that guy?
He doesn't exist, and if he does,
I am going to get rid of him!
Blood! You mad idiots!
Can I do my interview sitting there?
The first time I saw a harp, it was in a dream
I must have been four or five.
Perhaps even less
I didn't know what that little golden thing was... There is still blood
Once I saw a picture in a book showing Rome burning and Nero...
...holding an instrument that looked like the one from the dream
Then another time, in a scented calendar...
...there was a flying angel who was playing the harp
The very same one
I saw in the dream
The harp is like a human being
Let me tell you something.
I couldn't live in a house...
...where there isn't harp
I can't go to sleep if I know it's not in the other room...
...if it's not in the living room
Sometimes I have the impression that other hands are touching it
I can hear it being played.
Maybe it's just the wind
The harp is my whole life
Not only from a financial point of view
It's been my shelter, my friend
I have always been on my own.
I have never had a man
Nobody. Just my harp
I talk to her
She talks back and shares her feelings
It's an overwhelming feeling of joy...
...and sadness at the same time
But the most important thing is that it instils faith
If you play the harp, you believe that there are other dimensions
Once a child asked me...
..."Where does music go when you stop playing?"
Only a child could ask such a question
Orchestra, don't fear, the conductor's death is near!
Orchestra, don't fear, the conductor's death is near!
Orchestra, if you play, you betray
Orchestra, don't fear, the conductor's death is near!
Orchestra, if you play, you betray!
Orchestra, if you play, you betray!
Orchestra, if you play, you betray!
Orchestra, if you play, you betray!
That's our new conductor!
Your time is up, conductor give it up!
Your time is up, conductor give it up!
Long live the metronome!
Metronome! Metronome!
Metronome! Metronome!
All musicians will finally be free!
Your time is up, conductor give it up!
Your time is up, conductor give it up!
Down with the metronome!
Music has its rhythm, its cadence!
We want to set them!
It is time to stop playing music that works against us
Since we play it, we also want to create it!
Conducting is forbidden!
We don't want anyone to direct us!
You stupid bitch!
I'll kill you!
He's going to kill us!
Are you mad? Give me that revolver!
- Give it to me!
- You're hurting me!
I have a gun permit.
It's in my wallet
- Take a look
- Let me see it
I have a gun permit
It's in his name
- It's a proper gun permit
- See? I told you I had one
Pull yourself up
Smith & Wesson?
Look!
Up there! Up there!
Hey, look!
Mario, look! It's coming down!
It's all coming down!
Help! Help!
Help me!
Clara!
Clara!
Why?
You are here
I am here
Each of you must focus on his own instrument
It's the only thing we can do
Could anyone please help me?
Music saves us
Music saves us
Rely on the notes
Follow the notes
One after the other
Just as my hands can guide you
We are musicians
You are musicians
And we are here to rehearse
Don't be afraid.
The rehearsal goes on
Gentlemen, take your places.
Take your places, please
Thank you
Shall we make sound less colourful?
Don't forget that noise is not music
This is not a tram taking a sharp turn.
I heard the noise of pans
Where are we?
Are we at a football stadium?
Do you think I am the referee?
Brass, what are you doing?
What's happening to your small lungs?
Are you out of breath?
Did you use it all up to talk?
Play energetically!
With force! These trumpets should wake up the dead!
This is making me fall asleep!
Are you musicians or not?
I want a sound that has the colour of fire!
Gentlemen, let's start at the beginning!

According to rumours,
Itto is now an assassin with a child,
If I might enquire, why does such a thing concern you, my lord?
You old fool!
What's wrong with the Yagyu clan?
Why have you still not dealt with Ogami?
Old man, the Yagyu clan are besmirching the office of Official Executioner!
I'm told that officials of the Shogunate have discussed a sanctioned manhunt.
A sanctioned manhunt?
If ltto Ogami is declared a wanted criminal, all domain lords and their deputies will be ordered to pursue him.
When that happens, the reputation of the Yagyu clan and the office of Executioner will be in ruins.
My lord, I beg you not to authorise such an action.
I still have a daughter remaining, my lord.
She is my youngest daughter, Kaori.
She is stronger than any of her brothers, she can destroy ltto for certain.
She will destroy him.
You have my word, my lord!
Still too slow.
How can you expect to defeat Ogami's
Sui-O style techniques like that?
Next.
If you want to avoid the falling blade, you must first deal with the others.
If you want to avoid the other blades, then beware of the falling one.
Next.
Impressive, Uzuki.
You've deduced the secret of my falling blade technique.
Match both blades to the enemy's movements.
React and adjust accordingly.
Visualise the thrown blade as being directly above your head.
Then simply lure the opponent into the space you occupy.
Your deaths will not be without significance.
Forgive me.
Kaori.
Yes, sir.
The only remaining survivors of the Shadow Yagyu clan are you and l.
You are the Yagyu family's last hope.
You must avenge your brothers.
Slay ltto Ogami and his only son Daigoro!
I understand, sir.
Farewell, then.
You may go.
Ozunu, the leader will escort you to ltto's location.
I've been informed by my men that ltto Ogami is heading to the capital along the Sanyo Road.
I see. You are dismissed.
Lady Kaori, allow me to escort you.
I will go alone.
But my informants have already ascertained ltto's whereabouts.
But can your men kill ltto?
"The wolves headed west."
"The wolves are crossing eastwards."
Well, if it isn't Lord Ogami! Welcome.
You are most kind.
This way, please.
Azami...
...I am about to take Daigoro with me to the very heart of Edo.
Once there, I must slay Retsudo Yagyu to restore our name.
"The cub is here."
- Daigoro?
- Over here!
Daigoro?
Let's go home!
Bye!
One and two.
Three and four
And bloom like the flower of the cherry tree...
Beanbags filled with iron filings.
You are?
I am Kaori Yagyu!
You killed my three brothers.
Now I'm the only child left in the family!
I will take the lives of both you and your son, ltto Ogami!
Three brothers? Then you must be...
I'm Retsudo's daughter!
Fight!
With that mirror.
Any closer, and I'll be within the effective range of her technique.
How...
...could you keep your son on your shoulders...
...after you'd seen through my falling blade technique?
How dare you use your own son to save yourself!
As a father... you are a coward!
We, father and son,
We exist at the gateway to the netherworld.
Lady Kaori is dead!
Kaori?
Hyoei!
Hyoei, are you there?
It is l, Retsudo.
Answer me, if you are there.
Your three brothers...
...and your sister...
...were all defeated by ltto Ogami.
Now you are the only one that remains alive.
If ltto Ogami is not destroyed, not only the Shogunate but also the Shadow Yagyu clan...
...will become the laughing stock of the nation.
All that's left for me now...
...is Hyoei...
You are all I have!
Hyoei, the time has come, as the new heir of the Shadow Yagyu clan, for you to destroy ltto Ogami!
The time has come for you to make yourself known to the world as my son.
So my siblings, the legitimate heirs of the Shadow Yagyu clan, are dead.
And now you expect me to call you my father?
And out of desperation to slay ltto, you have come to my mountain lair!
How considerate of you!
Hyogo, Kurando, Gunbei and Kaori.
All were highly-skilled swordsmen, yet all were defeated.
And now you say
I am the only one you can rely on?
You must destroy ltto, for the sake of the Yagyu clan.
Simply because I was the child of your concubine, you abandoned me in the mountains when I was only five.
Can you imagine how much that innocent five-year-old child yearned for a mother and father?
It's remarkable that I'm still alive.
- Hyoei...
- Listen!
The only ones I regard as my parents are the Spider Demons of the Kiso-Ontake Mountains!
Hyoei, have you lost your sense of reason?
I refuse to be called a Yagyu.
The Yagyu clan shall taste the bitter ashes of ignominy!
Wait!
Hyoei! Won't you wait?
I call upon thee, all the gods who reside in tranquillity in the heavens.
I pray to thee, almighty gods who watch over this land.
Three chosen souls were sent to the afterlife to be purified.
I now beseech you for the return of their souls.
I pray to thee, almighty gods, and humbly send you my request.
Reveal yourselves, brave warriors!
Mujo.
Muga.
Mumon.
The three of you were buried for 42 days.
Through the 42 Days Rite of the Spider Demon Tribe, you have been reborn as divine spirits.
Though alive, you are not mere mortals.
Though dead, you are not mere corpses.
Our time has come!
As Spider Demon clan members, we must live to our fullest, and as samurai, honouring our Spider Demon principles, we shall usurp the Yagyu clan and make our mark on the world.
Destroy ltto Ogami!
The Yagyu clan means nothing to us!
We shall destroy the Lone Wolf and Cub!
Oh, what an adorable little boy!
Here. See, it's a whistle.
Here you go.
It stretches. it shrinks.
And it melts in your mouth so softly!
- Y es, please!
- Certainly!
You, too?
How about a sweet for your son, sir?
I'll take one.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Here, they taste good.
Thanks.
Won't you come and buy some?
Daigoro!
Wherever the two ofyou venture, father and son.
Innocent people will die.
Who are you?
The lady troubadour and the sweet seller.
Neither had anything to do with you, and yet they are dead.
How tragic!
Everywhere the two of you venture, innocent people such as they will lose their lives.
Sorry to bother you this late, but I'd like a room for the night.
Just coming, sir!
Welcome, sir!
Thank you.
Omatsu, put the cart away.
How adorable!
I'll light the lamp for you.
Come on inside.
There you go.
I'll bring you some food right away.
It won't be much but please be patient.
Thank you for waiting.
Who's there?
If the two ofyou request a room for the night, or food, or ifyou request anything from anyone, those innocents that you talk to will die.
How tragic!
No matter where the two of you go, there will be a bloodbath of carnage and a tempest of death!
The Spider Demon "Five Wheels" technique will strip you of happiness, anger, sadness, joy and fear.
The five human emotions and the five senses will be erased.
A Spider Demon?
We 'll take from the two of you all your happiness and sadness, all your anger and joy,
Ieaving you immersed in nothing but fear.
That is the Spider Demon
"Five Wheels " technique.
The two of you are nothing but harbingers of death to begin with.
Step by step, you will walk the path of bloody carnage.
Lord Retsudo,
Proceed.
I'm afraid that Lord Hyoei is using unprecedented techniques to pursue ltto Ogami and his son.
Hyoei is doing what?
It seems that ltto Ogami is finally starting to show signs of fear.
That dishonest bastard!
- Lord Retsudo...
- Quiet, Ozunu!
What's the matter with the Kurokuwa clan?
Are you holding back, scared of Hyoei?
Hyoei is a Spider Demon.
I'm afraid that is not his true affiliation.
The fact is, as surely as your blood runs through his veins, he is a true Yagyu heir.
True... but he rejected my sincere request.
He grew up in the mountains amidst the birds and beasts, he grew up in total isolation.
Because of this, the only one who can influence him is...
- Who?
- Lord Hyoei's younger sister.
Lady Azusa.
Nobody else can possibly do it.
Azusa?
Ozunu, go and find her at once.
Lady Azusa...
...please listen to what I have to say.
This message is on behalf of your father Lord Retsudo.
You must try to convince Hyoei, as he will listen only to you.
What is he burying?
Daigoro.
He's a very cautious fellow...
I am a chief advisor of the Zeze clan,
I am the assassin "Lone Wolf and Cub".
It is way past the time we arranged in the signs by the road.
I'd like to know the reason for your tardiness.
I have no excuse for being late, sir, but due to unforeseen circumstances,
I humbly ask you to accept
50 gold pieces as a cancellation fee.
I know how selfish it is of me to do this, but I ask for your understanding.
May I ask the reason?
I believe that it is best for both of us if I do not reveal that.
Then why did you come?
If the supplicant does not show up, naturally the request is voided.
As you are the former Official
Shogunate Executioner, ltto Ogami, an ordinary assassination isn't worth your time.
Tell me the reason why you wish to cancel the assignment.
It seems that you would consider it dutiful to do so.
If you put it like that, I have no choice.
I wished to keep silent for your own benefit.
It's the Yagyu clan.
I am aware of the bad blood between you and the Yagyu clan.
To wrest the position of Official Executioner from you, the Shadow Yagyu arranged to entrap you.
After you fell victim to their ruse, they say you chose to become an assassin to get revenge.
But that was until yesterday.
The situation has now changed.
How so?
I'm told that the Yagyu, with many allies, will soon begin a manhunt.
A manhunt?
In other words, and the domain lords and deputies will be ordered to pursue you.
Lord Ogami, you may take my boat.
You can then head north across the lake and escape beyond the mountains.
When I receive the Yagyu's order,
I'll be forced to go after you as well.
I hope you can see that what I'm telling you is the truth.
I thank you.
Daigoro...
- What are you doing?
- You have no respect!
No samurai disrespects his sword by standing on it! It is a part of his soul!
When you arrived, you sat down wearing your sword.
How do you explain that?
And you've covered your face.
You may be a Zeze clan advisor, but you do not behave like a samurai!
You're no samurai.
It's obvious that you're a Spider Demon!
Well done, ltto Ogami.
You saw through my deception.
I lied about being an advisor to the Zeze clan.
I am Hyoei of the Spider Demon clan!
Itto Ogami, you're about to die a warrior's death by our Spider Demon swords.
What do you have to say to that?
Is silence your answer?
When a samurai dies,
That being so, before brandishing your sword at another, you should announce your name and request a duel.
I told you,
I'm Hyoei of the Spider Demons.
Hyoei, a Spider Demon?
That's ridiculous!
To begin with, why would the Spider Demon clan want me dead?
- You're following Retsudo's orders!
- I know no such Retsudo.
I heard that Retsudo had an illegitimate son...
...and that he was named Hyoei...
Silence, ltto!
All this talk of fathers and sons is nonsense!
I, Hyoei, shall destroy you, and I will force Retsudo to taste the bitter ashes of ignominy.
Our name shall become renowned and replace the Yagyu!
He who makes his true name known when making a challenge exhibits good manners in the face of death.
Will you fight honourably like a samurai or dishonourably like a ruffian?
Perhaps you'll resort to your magic tricks to attack me.
Are you that afraid of my Sui-O techniques?
Speak, Hyoei!
Of course, Spider Demon swordsmen are nothing but cowards!
What?
How amusing for me to abide by the code of the samurai, in order to slay you, the demon of the crossroads to hell!
If you wish for us to duel as samurai, then let us fight honourably.
Be gone! All of you!
Now fight, ltto Ogami!
Very well.
Hyoei Tsuchigumo of the Spider Demon style.
Itto Ogami of the Sui-O style.
The Spider Demons must replace the Yagyu clan at all cost, so the world shall know us to be true samurai.
You must understand that every day that I live at the crossroads of hell...
...is another day of suffering for me.
I am aware of that.
Like you, there is one matter that I must settle before I die.
My request is that we part ways for the time being...
...for we will meet again, if we both survive.
Very well.
Before I die, I must...
Brother!
What are you doing, brother?
- Bear my child...
- Brother!
Let my child - our child - lead the Spider Demon clan!
Azusa!
We cannot let Retsudo and the Yagyu clan have their way!
Our tribe cannot hide in the mountains forever.
Azusa! Bear my child.
Bear my child for me!
Bear me a son to lead the Spider Demons!
Brother!
This is my way of showing Retsudo that I have opposed him to the very end!
You shall cultivate my seed, Azusa.
Hyoei, have you gone insane?
We two have stepped into the netherworld of beasts.
Please kill us both.
Father!
What a fool you've been... Hyoei.
You could have finished off ltto Ogami!
However...
...you were a fool!
You requested an honourable duel as a samurai and lost!
Spider Demon tribesmen, prepare yourselves!
You're now under my command!
- We refuse.
- What?
Allow us to carry out our leader Hyoei's command and slay ltto Ogami on our own.
We never imagined that he'd lure us into the snow.
If we remain here for much longer, our techniques will be useless.
It's no use.
We'll freeze to death.
Now!
Indeed... you are terrifying, ltto Ogami, for you have defeated the Spider
Demon Five Wheels technique.
How I wish I did not have to wear this face...
...at least as I lie dying.
How tragic...
What's tragic is your Spider Demon
Five Wheels technique.
I've been waiting for you, Retsudo!
Itto Ogami, I've lost my six children, six Yagyu heirs, because of you.
I am all that remains.
You're the one who caused it all!
Yet your only son Daigoro is still alive.
I hope you go insane with loneliness!
This shall be the final reckoning to avenge all our dead.
I wish the same!
Attack!
Daigoro!
Daigoro!
Lord Retsudo!
Attack!
Take that!
You fool!
Now!
Lord Retsudo, it is best
Itto...
He may be the "Lone Wolf and Cub"...
...but one day I will slay him!
Pa!
Daigoro...
The End
THE CASTLE OF PURITY
I'm done.
Want some help?
Quiet. Don't interrupt.
There's no talking during work.
One hour, Voluntad.
Beatriz, someone went through my stuff.
Nobody goes into your room, Gabriel.
Only you have the key.
Porvenir, were you in my room?
-No, not me.
-Then it was Utopia.
No, Father. I haven't even gone upstairs.
Do the statue of happiness.
-Do the statue of death.
-No, not that one!
-Yes! That one!
-Do the statue of war, Mom.
No!
I say what!
Do the statue of death.
Hey, don't bother.
An old man lives alone there and he left early.
Oh, excuse me.
Here, go hang it.
-All is well?
-Yes, Father.
May I?
I brought you a gift.
Come. Sit with me.
-Smell. Do you like it?
-Yes.
This cream is excellent for the hands.
Put some on.
Let me put some lotion on you.
-I'll be downstairs.
-Gabriel.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Beatriz.
Hand me some bread.
You didn't dry your hands.
It's rude to talk during meals.

-I want water.
-Wait.
Okay. Next one.
I want to see the ocean.
Don't say that or
Father will get mad.
I'll tell Mother to take us.
Why tell her?
You know we've never gone out, we never will.
Anyway, I want to see the ocean.
Remember when Mother told us about it?
-She said it is real pretty.
-But going out is bad.
It's horrible outside.
And the goddess of the sun, offended and sad...
-...went into a cave located...
-Located.
Located at the foot of an enormous mountain...
-Enormous.
-Enormous.
Once inside, wishing she forgot the world...
...and her husband's ingratitude...
...she closed the entrance with a very heavy rock.
Thanks to the help of some invisible pages...
...who arrived on quick lightning bolts that came...
-That came.
-That came from the king.
-Who is the king?
-The sun.
Let's not read anymore.
Tell us something.
What do you want me to tell?
Stuff.
When I was Voluntad's age...
...I played at the river every afternoon.
I made paper boats.
Like those Porvenir makes.
-Make me one!
-Wait.
One time, some bulls showed up...
...and suddenly, one came loose...
What are bulls like?
You saw them in your sticker book.
They're the animals with horns.
They're beautiful but very aggressive.
Are they edible?
People that eat meat eat them.
-We don't.
-What did the bull do?
It chased me.
I screamed and ran,
I was so scared.
But it didn't catch up to you?
No. They killed it.
Come and sit down.
-Did you study the maxims?
-Yes.
Tell me Goethe's.
''A man with a strong will...
...shapes the world at his taste'' Goethe.
Very good.
Now, Ellis.
''To find men, you must turn your back on humanity'' Ellis.
I don't understand.
That if you're going to be superior to other people...
...you mustn't pay attention to what they say or do...
...but live as you know how you should live...
...so that later you can set your example.
-Yes.
-Don't yawn! I'm speaking!
-Did you understand?
-Yes, Father.
Chesterton.
''All men are common men.
Extraordinary men are those sure that they are.''
-Go to your room.
-Yes, Father.
Don't move, son.
I could cut it wrong.
-You hold my head.
-You have very pretty hair.
It's gotten really thick.
Look. It's your first cut.
Touch it.
Feel how soft it is.
Don't mix it up!
-This is Utopia's.
-Let me see!
-Porvenir's is prettier.
-What about me?
Here is yours.
But don't touch it.
-Don't move.
-Don't move!
-What did you say?
-I didn't say anything.
My love! My love!
My love! My love!
The kids are downstairs, they could hear us.
It's always the same with you.
You only think of yourself.
You have no right.
Gabriel, please.
Come here.
You were always surrounded by men.
You think about them all the time...
...even though you pretend not to think!
-Go to the kitchen.
-Lunch is ready.
Clean the machines.
I'm hungry.
Bring food to my room.
Yes, Father.
He's mad again.
Your break is over!
Go back to the shop.
Do you know how many corpses could fit here?
-You didn't eat a thing.
-I'm disgusted.
There are rats everywhere.
They're not dying.
We have to make stronger pesticides.
They're not eating what I put out for them.
They warn each other of the danger some how.
Tell me something.
Rats and mice hate each other...
...can you imagine giving them something to drive them crazy?
To have them kill each other?
Every day millions are born.
The newborn females, before they leave the nest...
...are already pregnant.
If they were fighting or eating their spring...
...they wouldn't have time to reproduce.
It's instinct. Beasts only seek pleasure.
By reproducing they pass their horror and filth.
It's a circIe that'll only end at the end of time.
It's the same with people.
You know men by studying rats.
They're the same!
That's why I don't want you in contact with the world.
It's best you stay inside with the rats...
...than seeing the best people out there.
Why are you saying this?
Don't speak like that.
You can't compare people with rats.
Besides, you've always loved your children.
Yes, but they're different.
How can they be if they have never been outside?
Don't you see?
We haven't gone outside in 18 years.
18 years without seeing the street.
You dare complain?
On the contrary, I have always been happy with you.
There's nothing better than living with a man like you.
I don't need anything else.
These 18 years have been wonderful.
I don't need to go out.
Remember when we moved?
Utopia was a newborn.
Voluntad has never seen the world outside.
There isn't a way out.
If it hadn't been for that, where would we be?
You knew the world.
You know how it is.
I see it when I go out.
It was a good decision.
The proof is that the kids are healthy, pure, happy.
If they were in the world they'd have been corrupted.
Can you imagine Utopia?
Poor thing.
What a surprise!
How nice to see you,
Mr. Gabriel.
I'm here as always to trouble you.
Are you feeling better,
Mrs. Luisa?
The same.
Old people are hopeless.
Don't say that,
Mrs. Maria Luisa.
You'll bury us all.
How many bags should I leave?
How many?
A dozen and a half, please.
Only a dozen.
We still have some from last time.
Let me see.
She'll be with you in a second.
Twelve.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Have a good day.
How many do you want?
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Lima.
I can't take anymore.
Look, Mr. Lima, this is more profitable.
It's very requested because of the commercials.
But that's crap!
Can't you see?
My product is better because it isn't industrialized!
It's done by hand.
That can't even kill a fly!
Haven't you noticed?
It's in polyethylene bags.
Do you know it's an indestructible material?
It'll be in dumpsters till the end of time!
I'm really sorry, Mr. Lima.
-Let's start the game!
-Are you finished?
-Yes.
-Well, then let's go.
Okay!
One, two, three!
-I'll catch you, Voluntad!
-No! No!
I'm coming after you,
Utopia!
Utopia, stop!
Utopia!
No, Porvenir!
No!
Enough, Utopia!
Come and help me!
Your father doesn't want you to read...
...things he doesn't give you.
If he finds this, he'll get mad.
Go on,
I'll be right back.
I'm going to my room.
One moment please,
Mr. Gabriel.
We've missed you, Mr. Gabriel.
Haven't we?
-Shall I leave a dozen?
-Of course, Mr. Gabriel.
-Excuse me, Mr. Gabriel.
-It's not a problem.
I need to see you alone.
You'll profit from it.
I want you to sleep with me.
I'll pay you.
Are you insane?
If my mother finds out you'll be in trouble.
Here you go.
Count it.
I have to tell you something.
You won't get mad?
What is it?
Take care of your daughter.
She's very flirty.
-Excuse me?
-She's very flirty.
-What?
-She came on to me.
Really?
I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't true. I never lie.
Take care of her, ma'am.
Take good care of her.
-She could get lost.
-Thank you, Mr. Gabriel.
You're coming with me!
I'll take you to a place only I know of!
-I'm glad you're home.
-I want to be calm.
Dad is home!
Dad is home!
-Put everything as it was.
-Yes, Father.
-We'll end up starving.
-What?
Nobody wants to buy our product.
They say that junk made in factories is profitable.
Don't worry.
Ours is better.
It can't be if they're not asking for it.
-Gabriel...
-We'll starve, I'm telling you!
Tomorrow, cut the food rations.
We'll use less energy and all those luxuries.
Say goodbye to your make-up.
-I use them to please you.
-We'll starve!
Don't be like that.
Don't worry.
I'm sure everything will be all right.
I'm tired!
I don't want to work anymore.
We have to hurry!
We're down 100 bags.
What were the men like before you met me?
You didn't tell me exactly how many.
Please, Gabriel, don't start.
This conversation never ends well.
I warn you, it's worse not knowing!
Gabriel, you know everything about me!
I know nothing.
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Your mother tried to hurt herself with this.
I had to yank it from her!
Don't tell your brothers anything.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Beatriz!
You have to help me.
I'm so scared.
Don't be scared.
I love you, Gabriel.
I don't care about going outside...
...you think I would've tolerated this with another?
How many people will there be in the year 2000?
-Seven billion.
-Very good.
How many children die of hunger every year?
Three million and a half.
The more people there are...
...the more crime and addiction there'll be.
It's natural.
People don't know how to coexist.
Everything is wrong.
And it'll get worse.
-Can I turn it on?
-Yes.
The birth of the great Celtic.
Under terrible shadows, a King will be born...
...and will be feared by all.
His ancient blood will be reborn in him...
...and his Age of Bronze will turn to Gold.
It means this king will govern with patience and kindness.
He'll give a different face to his race.
Thanks to his teachings the Bronze Age...
...a time of violence and wars...
...will become an Age of prosperity. A Golden Age.
He'll open the bronze doors by force.
The King will bring down the Temple of War.
They will no longer use citadels and forts.
The world will find peace with his guidance.
You understood this?
The Great City will be like a desert.
Those who lived in it are surely dead.
It's streets deserted by looting and rape...
...and it's temples in ruins by profanation.
Nostradamus saw clearly what is happening.
You can go to bed now.
We'll stay and work a while.
Good night, Father.
Good night, Mother.
Sleep well.
Dear Minister.
I waited in vain for a month for your answer.
I suppose you haven't answered me back...
...because my enemies told you there is a contradiction...
...between my ideas and my personal and work life.
Why if I defend existence in all its forms...
...do I make a living producing pesticides?
-I make a living?
-Producing pesticides.
And I answer you: there is no contradiction.
Rats are man's enemy.
They destroy his crops, they loot their storages...
...they transmit diseases...
...and they've even devoured small children.
So they must be completely annihilated by the strongest.
Their only true strength, like all the weak...
...is its enormous reproductive capability.
There must be no mercy.
It's a matter of life or death.
You're it!
You're falling!
And only with inexorable energy...
...we will be able to bring the final catastrophe.
Sincerely, at your disposal,
Gabriel Lima.
That's right.
I'm very tired.
That letter you dictated was beautiful.
I think he will answer me this time.
Your thoughts are extraordinary.
What you say is true.
I hope everything comes true...
...so people will know who you are.
Take me to bed.
Gabriel, what are you doing?
Nothing.
An experiment.
Someone's been knocking for a while.
I'll get it.
Mr. Gabriel,
I thought you weren't home.
I'm sorry, Inspector,
I didn't hear you.
There was a lot of noise.
Come in, please.
This house needs some plastering.
Why don't you hire someone?
No! I'll do it myself.
Be careful because it's dangerous.
With the rain, these old houses could fall.
A man!
Hello, how are you?
What's new?
-Good morning.
-Here's the paperwork.
Let me see.
Things have gotten rough.
I don't know if I can authorize your product.
What do you mean?
I've never had a problem with you.
My paperwork is in order.
Yeah, but you know how things are now.
What things?
Isn't it dangerous to have so many rats?
-They're all vaccinated.
-At least.
-Aren't you scared of them?
-I'm used to them now.
What do you say?
Do I authorize or not?
Yes, authorize it.
Very well then.
Because you say so.
You have a 47.50 percent of royalties.
Show me your sales permit.
Oh, it's being processed, right?
-Yes.
-Thank you, sir.
Can you give me some samples for the lab?
Sure, take as many as you like.
Thank you.
Good bye, Miss, it's been a pleasure.
-You damn flirt!
-No! No!
Let me go! No!
Gabriel!
Leave her alone!
Stop it!
Are you insane?!
Don't you see what you've done?!
Stay out of this!
I know what I'm doing!
-It's for her own good!
-That's what you think!
Look at what you're doing to your kids!
My children are not like that!
You are against me!
I've given you everything!
Look what you've done!
I'm going to kill!
My poor baby girl.
Tell me what happened.
I don't know, Mother.
I don't know.
Don't cry, my love.
Calm down.
I don't want him to hit me!
Stop crying.
You're prettier now.
Look in the mirror.
You see?
I had my hair like that when I met your father.
Who would've imagined all of this then?
He'd go to my house to visit.
We spent hours talking.
He told me that when we got married...
...we'd have a lot of kids and our family would be unique.
He's really kind with me.
I do as he says because it's for our own good.
But he should never have touched you.
You're so young.
Gabriel has changed.
He's so strange now.
Sometimes even I am afraid of him.
Two pork tacos, please.
-With our without salsa?
-With, please.
Thank you.
They were knocking for a long time.
-Didn't you see who it was?
-No.
It must've been the water guy.
I've told him never to come after 9 a.m.
Call the kids.
I have a surprise.
I brought you these toys!
Look at them.
I won't give them to you now, but in a few days...
...that way you'll really enjoy them!
They're really pretty, Father.
Thank you.
Did you bring me a shovel?
No, but I got you more animal sticker books.
Thank you, Father.
I have to tell you something.
As of tomorrow in this house there'll be no more yelling.
I want us all to get along.
-Gabriel?
-Yes?
The garbage truck
is here.
I'm going with you!
Move, girl.
Get inside!
Thank you.
Wait in the living room!
Idiot!
Why'd you let them out?!
-Shit!
-Please, Gabriel.
-You are just like your mother.
-Why?
Why?!
I turn my head and she hit the streets!
I can't live in this house!
It's all your fault!
I tried to save them from the world but I couldn't.
-It's your inheritance!
-Gabriel, nothing happened.
Sit there.
I married you out of pity!
I always pitied you!
I never felt anything else for you! It's all your fault!
You'll never get away with it!
Go bathe.
Voluntad!
Voluntad!
She's not here!
What is it?
Tell her to bring me
the towel!
I'll lend you mine.
Wait!
Throw it over!
Bastards!
Dogs!
Disgusting!
Dogs!
You bitch!
-No, Father!
-You bastard!
-No, Father!
-Disgusting!
-You bastard!
-Father!
You damn bastard!
Fucking bastard!
-No!
-You pig!
Fucking bastard!
I won't tolerate this!
You disgust me!
You pigs!
-Stop it!
-Move!
-You have no right!
-I haven't?!
Calm down, I'm sure they haven't done anything wrong.
Nothing wrong?!
They're worst than rats!
-Gabriel!
-Move!
-You have no right!
-I do!
Now you'll see!
You'll get your comeuppance!
Look what you've done.
Look!
Calm down, Gabriel!
Please!
It's your fault.
It's all your fault!
Look what you've done!
You screwed everything up.
It's your fault.
It's all over.
I failed.
Nobody has ever understood me. Nobody.
Not even you.
No, Gabriel, everything will be the same.
It had to happen.
You never talked to them about those things.
But they're children.
They love you as much as I do.
I've always loved you,
Gabriel.
Remember when we were young and we went to the country?
Everything was so beautiful.
You were always happy.
Weren't you?
They were good times.
You told me that we should live...
...without others interference.
Everything was alright...
...but I knew something would happen.
You never thought of what this would become in time.
Everything's changed.
I did your will for my children.
For them and the peace of this house...
...a peace you don't see, understand or appreciate.
But you know
I love you so much...
...and you take advantage of that.
Give it some of this.
It's new.
Two hands.
-Done, Father.
-Good. Leave it.
Do rats eat meat?
Yes. Only those kinds of animals eat meat.
-What does it taste like?
-Blood. Horrible.
Now.
It's dead, Father.
Voluntad, one day we'll make these traps.
They're called
''El Castillo''.
I saw them in a German magazine years ago...
...but I perfected them.
It's like a snail.
The rat goes through this door and can't get out.
It reaches the center where there's cheese.
When it's about to eat it, the floor sinks.
The rat falls into a bucket of water and dies.
10 can drown in one night.
It's really pretty.
Here.
Let them out.
Hang this.
I don't like this.
It has too much garlic.
From now on you'll be far from your brother!
You'll sleep with the light on!
When I go out, you'll stay in your room!
Women are to blame for everything.
Because of you!
I was weak because of you!
You made them disobey me!
You plotted everything!
It's your fault!
I'm going to kill you!
Here, take this to my room.
-What did he say?
-Nothing.
He didn't even talk to me.
I'm really scared.
I've never seen him like this.
What you did was wrong, try to understand him.
Don't be afraid.
You know I love nobody like you. Nobody.
That's not true.
You love my father more.
You remind me so much of him...
...but you're so different.
-I liked it outside.
-Outside?
Yes.
-Is this sugar?
-Yes.
-Eat a bit.
-Okay.
-I love you, Porvenir.
-Me too, Mother.
Help.
Better yet, help us.
Yes, that's it.
My Father has us locked up.
He has us all locked up.
Now he wants to kill us.
We live at GonzaIes #99.
Come quickly.
Utopia.
Gabriel?
I was just with a girl.
Really young.
She was a virgin, unlike you!
No wonder there's never been purity here.
It's all lies, why do you say that?
You have no right!
I've been nothing but faithful and tolerant!
I did everything you asked,
I always did your bidding!
I've had to live with what you make up!
I can't anymore.
I can't take it!
-What's wrong with you?
-What's wrong?!
How dare you?!
Leave me alone!
Get out of my room now!
Honey!
Don't be like that.
Don't be like that.
Beatriz, honey, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Beatriz, I love you.
I love you, Beatriz.
Sweetie, don't be mad.
Tell me what you want to make you happy.
-No, Father. I'm not mad.
-Yes you are. I know.
But you're good and soon you'll be happy.
Utopia, pass me the platter.
I told you I don't want you touching him!
Father!
Father, no!
Gabriel, stop it!
I'm locking you up.
This time you won't even have water!
You saw it!
He hit me!
Did you see?
He hit me!
It's your fault too.
You won't get off the hook this time.
You're going to die!
Utopia!
Let him out.
-A rat can drown.
-No. They can swim.
-Really?
-Of course.
All animals can swim.
Come.
Utopia.
Utopia!
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm just as scared as you are.
I don't understand.
I don't know what to do.
But we must be patient.
It'll pass.
We've always been so happy.
I don't understand.
He's never been like this.
He's gone mad.
He's gone mad.
He's mean.
No, he's not mean.
He's very good.
He loves you very much.
I don't love him anymore.
Know people.
Listen to this.
The Detroit, Michigan Zoo had to hire 4 more guards...
...to protect the animals from the visitors attacks.
The cruelty bragged by the zoo's assistants...
...often causes these animal's deaths.
A kangaroo cub was beaten to death.
A duck was speared with an arrow.
The hippopotamus, expecting its cub...
...was thrown a rubber ball and it choked.
They threw poisoned meat in the eagle's cage.
-The zoo's employees...
-Father?
-Don't interrupt.
-May I go to the bathroom?
-You have your hours.
-It's something else.
Go.
The zoo's employees...
...don't know how to stop this.
Careful, careful.
Don't kill them.
They won't die.
They can swim.
-Let me wet them.
-No, I am.
-Let me!
-No, Voluntad.
With your hair like that you look like a lady.
You look really pretty.
-My eyes hurt.
-It must be the dust.
-I didn't sleep well.
-How come?
-I'm really scared.
-Why? What's wrong?
I can't tell you.
You've always told me everything.
-I told on Father.
-What?
I told on him with the police.
What are you saying?
I sent a letter to the police telling on him.
To the police?
I told them he was going to kill us.
Honey, why did you do that?
Because I'm scared,
Mother!
Don't be scared.
It'll be all right.
Look how happy we are.
You have me.
I'll protect you.
You mustn't be scared.
The police.
What have you done?
Utopia?
What's wrong?
-What is it?
-She doesn't feel well.
You too?
What's wrong, Beatriz?
Tell me, please.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
How are you, Miss?
Nice to see you.
My mother isn't here.
It doesn't matter.
I'll leave the product.
She can pay me later.
-Are you Gabriel Lima?
-Yes.
Show me your license to sell this product.
I don't have it on me.
They never ask for it.
-But you have it?
-Naturally!
I just leave it at home.
If you wish to come with me, I'll show you.
It's also been reported that it's a hazardous material.
-It's banned.
-I have a special permit.
The director is a close friend of mine.
Hey!
What about the bags?
I'll be right back.
-Wait here.
-We have to go with you.
-I'm telling you to wait!
-Don't yell at me, sir.
Don't tell me what to do, especially in my house!
You're in trouble.
Idiots! You don't know what you are doing!
Wait here.
I'll go.
The police!
The letter was a lie!
Please leave!
I didn't want them locked up!
I agreed so my children would be alright!
-Please leave!
-What are you talking about?
He has us locked up and he has the key!
-I didn't do anything!
-Get out of my house!
If you touch me,
I'll kill him!
-Let him go!
-Come here!
Please! Open the door!
Let me out! Please!
Go inside.
Get out or I'll kill my entire family!
-Get out!
-Call for backup.
Get out!
This is my house!
-Help! Let me out!
-Get out!
Hurry. Put the chair on top, Voluntad.
Hurry up!
Bring the lamp.
Bring it now!
Put it there.
Get down, now!
Wait here.
Do nothing.
He's insane.
If you don't get out,
I'll kill my family!
You're insane!
Don't be stupid!
-Let him go!
-Nobody is leaving!
Go away!
This is my house!
I'm in here!
Let me out!
Please!
Don't leave me here!
Stay here!
Stay here!
Bring the extinguisher.
Get me out of here!
Please!
I'm in here!
Get me out of here!
Don't move or they'll all die!
I'm up here!
Please, help me!
Get out!
Get out, please!
Get out!
Get out!
No!
Can't you see?
Give it to me!
Get out!
Get out of my house!
Get out!
Get out, bastards!
-Did you get my message?
-Message?
Get out of my house!
Get out!
Get out!
-Get out!
-No!
-Get out!
-No!
No! No, Father!
-Don't touch him!
-No!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Don't touch him!
Mother!
What's happening?
I love you, Gabriel!
THE END
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED
TO RAFAEL CASTANEDO
THE BUTCHER
To the inhabitants of Tremolat,
Périgord
What about the Périgueux sauce?
Get on with it!
Out of the way! We have work to do
I hope it's your best beef, Popaul!
I killed it myself. If it's not good
I'll cut my tongue out!
We'll eat it with sauce!
I'll carve
How about that?
Why are you laughing?
It looks so good, that's all
Not like in the army
When they did have a bit of good meat...
...they cooked it like leather
As father of the bride,
I'm expected to make a speech
It won't be long, because
I don't want to talk rubbish...
...and have my son-in-law correct my mistakes
When your daughter marries a teacher...
...you have to watch your grammar
Still, I know enough to say how this marriage pleases me...
...because I'm very fond of young Léon
He taught our youngest to read and write...
...he's a local lad and I'm sure he'll make my girl happy
You can be sure of that!
Funny things, weddings
Don't you think that weddings are funny?
Well, yes, everyone has a good time
- Things turn sour afterwards
- Not always
Some of my army pals were married
They weren't at home
Don't be evasive
They couldn't be sure
Miss Héléne, may I drink champagne?
Ask your mother
She says I can if you say so
- All right; do you like it?
- I've never tasted it
Not bad
- You accept responsibility
- Yes, I like that
He likes you; all the kids do, you know
Well, I like them, too
By popular request, I shall sing you a song
The Little Isle of Capri
Why won't you dance the waltz?
- You dance too well for me
- You're not so bad
I haven't danced much in fifteen years
The people are nice here, much nicer than elsewhere
Why did you join the army, then?
I'd have been all right here...
...but there was one rat among these nice people: My father
- How long have you lived here?
- Ten years; I knew your father well
Wasn't he a real swine?
He was a butcher
He wasn't even a good one; he killed badly and chopped meat anyhow
Weddings... my mother may have been happy on her wedding day...
...but what she went through after, poor thing
- Why did you never come back?
- To see the old man? No, thank you
I came back for my mother's funeral seven years ago
I was on holiday in Paris then
You holiday there, Parisians holiday here; that's logic
That's logic!
I'd liked to have seen you there
I wouldn't have minded;
I'd have been a nurse
We had good times, but...
The rice was good, wasn't it?
The rice was all right, but the rice fields were treacherous
- You smoke in the street?
- Are you shocked?
No, but it's unusual to see a woman smoke in the street
It's more hygienic than smoking indoors
Yes, that's logical
You're fond of logic, aren't you?
Well, I was fifteen years in the army
The army makes you appreciate two things you haven't got:
Logic and liberty
Do you live above the school?
- How long have you been headmistress?
- Three years
You're young for a headmistress
It's because I tread carefully
Are you fond of meat?
I ask because if I get a good animal some time...
...I could bring you some escalopes or choice joints
You know, some animals are better than others
What a dream... a butcher to choose your meat for you
How wonderful
While I think of it... do you have to learn to be a butcher?
Yes, you do really... and that's what's funny
I was a butcher with my father and in the army, too
I've always been a butcher, in
Algeria, in Indo-China... a butcher
Soldiers have to eat
Yes, that's logical
Well, here you are; I'll go home now
Thank you for seeing me home,
Popaul
- You look fed up, Léon
- I'd rather have stayed at home
Not tired of married life yet?
I hope you'll be very happy
You'll see how nice it is to go home to your wife after work
I'm going home to lunch
You've had five minutes extra break in honour of Monsieur Hamel's wedding
Are you deaf, you two?
Riri's father told him that the postman said...
...a dead woman has been found in Saint-Alver woods
He breathed an air of grandeur... comma...
...a majestic resolution... comma...
...a certain profundity...
...by which...
...even the most vulgar mind...
...must be impressed
Honoré de Balzac...
I'll write the name for you
Do you know who Balzac was?
A writer
He was a nineteenth century novelist...
...who portrayed the society of his time
But I'll tell you about that later
Hearing the door of her room open suddenly, Héléne...
Don't laugh just because it's my name
Héléne rose from the divan, but she saw the marquis...
...and gave a cry of surprise
He was changed almost beyond recognition
His pale face...
...had been bronzed by the tropical sun...
...giving him a poetic appearance
He breathed an air of grandeur, a certain profundity...
...by which even the most vulgar mind must be impressed
I don't want to disturb you
I know I shouldn't call in school hours
I've brought you a leg of lamb
It's a special one, look
Perhaps you'll help me collect the books
I used to sit there
Were you a good pupil?
I was fine at French and history, but no good at problems about trains
Our teacher wasn't nearly as nice as you, the old hag
Her name was Vachin; cow by name and cow by nature
- You mustn't insult my colleague
- Colleague or not, cow she was
They'd have heard about Vachin sooner or later
She'd never have let the butcher deliver during school hours
Have you got a fridge?
Wait, I'll walk as far as the baker's with you
Come and eat the lamb with me tonight, if you don't fear being compromised
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. You took me by surprise
It would lose half its savour if I ate it alone
Well, will you?
What time shall I come?
About seven, after I've marked the books
I'm not very busy these days
I do the buying and slaughtering; my assistant runs the shop
It's different in the autumn, in the game season
That was a policeman from Périgueux
About the crime at Saint-Alver
The Gaillotin girl was found stabbed to death
Two weeks ago Jean danced with her
But I've not seen her since
I expect some tramp did it
I'm sorry, I was miles away
The police will be here for ages
I expect you're right
It'll give us something to talk about, but still...
Will you put it on my account?
- Am I too early?
- No, come up, the door's open
Punctuality is the politeness of butchers
As Louis XIV said
- I've nearly finished
- So I am too early
No. Would you like a drink?
I can do without a drink;
I've drunk enough in my time
Why not sit there?
I'll be five minutes
- It must be fun to teach kids
- Yes, it's a worthwhile job
You smoke "Gauloises"?
What do you think of this?
It was so hot the air was like an overcoat
Well... is it good?
We could eat early, then go to the Sarlat cinema
Yes, but I don't like war films, they're disgusting
I made war for fifteen years; you must be stupid to enjoy war films
- Why did you stay in the army?
- Because I am stupid
I've seen a few things... it wasn't pretty
It's a comedy film tonight.
Shall we start cooking?
Downstairs to the kitchen?
I'm proud of my little kitchen
Did you see the police today?
It seems a girl was stabbed at Saint-Alver
They haven't found any clues
- How long to cook it?
- Half an hour will do
No garlic?
Never with lamb!
- Shall I make my salad?
- Yes, but you're my guest
Are the eggs hard-boiled?
What sign were you born under?
Libra, the Scales; that's why I swagger. I was born on 6th October
I'm Scorpio
- That's a bad sign
- All signs are good
Do you need anything else?
Just a small knife
My van's not very elegant to drive to Sarlat
There's my little car
What's so funny?
You and your little car
Haven't you seen me drive it?
A small escalope, please
Congratulations on the examination results
My young brother would have failed, but for you
They're back
It seems they're on the trail of some tramp
Maybe they've found a new clue
It's dreadful; think of that poor girl
I've seen corpses, head in the muck, cut in two, mouths gaping
Piled three or four high, kids with their eyes out
I've seen an old woman like her cut to pieces
I've seen my pals rotting in the sun, eaten by vermin
Yes, war is horrible, but it's a job to be done...
...whereas a murder like this is savagery
We counted bodies by the lorry-Ioad
Three francs. On your account?
There they go again
Monsieur La Hire, the school fête's on 22nd October
Can I come and ransack your costume collection?
You may have what you like
You said I could join in. I love dressing up and playing the fool
- And for you, Madame Tirant?
- I've come for my minced beef
What about a nice steak?
It would restore your teeth
Will you come mushrooming with
Charles and Lisette this afternoon?
- What time?
- About four
I may still be working then
Join us if you can, in the wood behind the grottoes
How's this for a haul?
I can sniff out mushrooms
Come and see the mushrooms
Popaul's found
Do you think you've done enough for one day?
I like to watch you with the children
Can we go and play over there?
You know, Miss Héléne, there's one thing I've noticed
School teachers are usually known by their surname
I never knew Vachin's first name...
...but with you it's the opposite, always Miss Héléne
Everyone calls you that.
What is your surname?
Do you mind me asking?
Not at all, why shouldn't you know my surname?
May I ask you another question?
But it's even more personal
Ask, anyway
You needn't answer
I think I know the question;
I promise I'll answer
Well, I'll take the plunge, then
Why is it you haven't a lover?
Because I don't want one
Yes, I understand...
...but the question is: Why not?
Because I had a very unhappy affair ten years ago
I was deeply in love with a boy who was everything I wanted
Then, after some months, he just left me
Well, that...
...that made me physically ill and it took me a long time to get better
That's why I came here; now I'm very happy
I don't say you're not happy, but still it's not normal
It's quite normal
It's not difficult to do without things
But that's awful
I'm not in the least troubled, you know
I love the children as if they were my own
You don't convince me
And anyway...
I know what I'm doing
It's fine that people meet, fall in love...
...make love and so on...
...but I don't want to take any more chances
I know that it's not always so marvellous...
...but never to make love can drive you crazy
Making love can send you mad, too
So it's irrelevant
Damn it all, if I kissed you, what would you say?
I wouldn't say anything
But I ask you not to
Are you giving me a present?
What for?
What's the date?
It's my birthday
- How handsome you are!
- It doesn't take much
You must understand the instincts, the feelings...
...even the intellect of Cro-Magnon man... were really human
Only his problems of subsistence differed from ours
What does subsistence mean?
Keeping alive
He began to draw
Do you know what desires are called when they rise above the savage state?
Aspirations
If Cro-Magnon man hadn't survived in his world, you wouldn't exist
What if Cro-Magnon man came back?
I don't know. He might adapt himself to our conditions
He might die
I don't want him to die;
I'm sure he was very nice
Has everyone brought lunch?
I've got some chocolate rolls if anyone is still hungry
I'd like a chocolate roll
Rain?
Of course not, the sky is clear
It's blood!
Don't move; I won't be long
I'm a police officer
I'm afraid I must ask you a few questions
I've come down on the night train, haven't slept a wink
This your classroom?
Young for a headmistress, aren't you?
They say you're a wonderful teacher
Périgueux's a bit out of its depth with these murders
They've called us in to cover themselves
Sadistic crimes are always a problem
So you found the body
I read your statement; no point in going over it
The kids must have been shocked, especially the little girl
I'd like to ask you...
Interesting point from the autopsy:
She wasn't raped
Not raped... that's extremely unusual
Usually... well, she can't have been dead long when you found her
Any unusual noises...
...before the blood and all that?
You didn't have the feeling that someone else was there?
You were going to say something
I'd been giving my attention to the children on the path down
- The kids heard nothing?
- Not as far as I know
We'll check that later. You say you approached the body...
Tell the infants to come in, too.
Monsieur Hamel may be away today
Did any of you who were on the outing yesterday...
...hear or see anything unusual?
Now don't invent anything, tell me the truth
They're not liars
- Can we talk somewhere else now?
- In the yard
Charles, I leave you in charge;
I won't be long
Keep quiet, like Miss Héléne said!
I congratulate you on your composure; it must have been terrifying
I don't want to keep you, but think carefully
Have you any idea, however vague, that might put us on the track?
There's no doubt that in this area, not necessarily locally...
...there's a madman at large, do you understand?
Yes, but I can't help you
Between ourselves... her husband...
Léon Hamel...
...could he have done it?
That's unthinkable
If you knew what we see, if you knew human nature...
You go to your pupils and I'll stew in my own juice
Can I use your phone?
Our line's through the post office and that's not open yet
- Every modern convenience
- It's the school phone, not mine
You're living in the Middle Ages
Not too squashed-up, children?
I'll give you something to draw
Can I come up? I've a surprise for you
I've brought it from Périgueux
Come up
Cherries in brandy, I hope you like them
Big ones, too; none of the rubbish they sell in cafés
Are you all right?
I'm a little tired.
Shall we taste them now?
Sit down, I'll find some dishes
This business is getting you down
They're the best I've ever had
They're good, aren't they?
This is the first time I've seen you out of sorts
Don't worry, Popaul, you're too kind
I'm not completely insensitive,
I know you've had a shock
And poor Hamel must be in a state
He couldn't work today
So you took his class, too
You must take a holiday.
If you fall ill...
No, I'm very strong
If you had seen her
I thought of the corpses you talked about
They couldn't have been worse
Don't think of her like that
Picture her on her wedding day, when we became friends
She was a little tipsy, flushed...
You're tired, and now you're crying
Dry your eyes
I saw some lambs at Périgueux; lovely joints they'd make
I'm sorry, I can't help it
You know what? I'll redecorate this room for you
Don't cry any more
It's over now
- Got a light?
- That's better
That's my lighter
Of course. It works beautifully
Are you starting again?
You're crying differently now
What shall I do? Go away?
Please stay! I want you to stay
I loved her so
Do you know Paul Thomas?
I had to trouble him, like everyone else. May I walk with you?
This is a dreadful business
No clue, no lead of any sort
The same sadist did both murders; the same wounds, no rape
If I don't stop him, he'll do it again
Interrogations get us nowhere; we can't lock people in their homes
We can't even be sure it's someone local
And the weapon... probably a flick-knife
Everyone has them in the country
I'm going to Miss Héléne's
- Is it nearly finished?
- Just the ceiling to do
Do question 5 on page 72
"A train leaves Orléans..."
You'll never learn if I set you easy problems
- My place is a shambles
- It'll be nice when it's finished
See you tomorrow
- Tomorrow's Sunday
- See you on Monday, then
Poor chap
I'm going shopping in Bergerac
Get to work, Charles; no slacking, both of you
She's always setting me problems about trains
Could you help me?
I've spilt paint on the carpet
You need spirit
Where is it?
You know everything
Since last year...
...she's been giving me train problems
Where are clean rags?
In the little table drawer
Shall I read you my problem?
Don't count on me
"Another train leaves Toulouse at 14.43..."
Any idea of the distance between
Orléans and Toulouse?
I never could understand those problems
I must be going. I've done the first coat, now it must dry
Shall I put the ladder away?
Do you know another girl's been murdered? At Bergerac this time
Didn't you hear? I said another girl's been found murdered
I'm not surprised. Do you think it's going to stop all of a sudden?
That's true, you're right, Popaul
Another murder?
Never mind that, have you done the problem?
I couldn't
- Don't you understand the principle?
- Not at all
You add together the distances travelled by each train...
It's double-dutch to me
One train travelled 367 kilometres...
Charles, did you look for something in this drawer?
No, Popaul looked for a cloth to clean the carpet
- It's late, you're tired
- Tomorrow's Sunday
Anyway, you've got the hang of the problem now
Let me in, I want to talk to you
Just for two minutes... please
Just a couple of words
I've got a headache.
Come tomorrow
It's important now
Really, I'm not very well.
Wait till the morning
I switched off the light.
I got in through the woodshed
Keep still and listen
I saw you found the lighter
So you knew it was me
When I discovered I'd lost it,
I bought another in Périgueux
I knew you'd notice if
I didn't have it
But that was a waste of time since you'd already found it
This is what I killed them with, this knife
I can't help myself, it's like a nightmare
I can't breathe until I've done it, until I've stuck my knife
Trust me
Don't speak
I know it's finished between us, my shame is terrible
I couldn't bear to face you;
I know I horrify you
And I can't bear that
Miss Héléne, help me
See, I've killed myself. Help me
Stay where you are, don't move
Let go
Press hard. I'm going to take you to hospital
Don't tell them why; don't tell them who I am
Hurry
I'm losing all my blood
Don't talk
I must talk to you now
I spent my nights thinking of you
I spent nights outside the school, looking at your window
You were the only one
When I saw your eyes...
...I forgot everything
I forgot who I was
I lived only for you
Please don't talk
You can't stop me
I want to take you in my arms
I would have liked to have been with you always, to love you...
...to protect you, to know you needed me
If I could have taken you to a desert island...
How far it is
I have so much blood
It keeps flowing
I know about blood,
I've seen so much...
...so much blood flowing
When you were there, there was no blood
I didn't think about blood
I don't know if I can hold out
My blood keeps flowing
Once, when I was little, I fainted at the sight of blood
Have you noticed the smell of blood?
All blood has the same smell...
...the blood of animals and the blood of men
Some blood is redder than others...
...but all blood smells the same
How far it is
Keep quiet, we're there
Kiss me
He's dead
When the lift stopped he cried
"Miss Héléne", then he died
You're tired; go home.
We'll see about the details tomorrow
Greetings and love.
To one and all.
In I presence I-preme coverage of I heights.
Love for everyone everywhere.
It is known that the cooperation of all colors of people... voice the decision of I heights.

What happened to the money you say you give me... to buy a bike?

Me no like how you go on so selfish.
Look how long I live and you still move so selfish amongst I.
I am going to give you that money, not because I promised you... but I want to see what you're going to take that motor bike and do... because I know you're going to broke your neck off it.

It's time to leave.
The brother like to fight against Dreadlocks. Let's step.
I and I will step, Horsemouth.
I don't feel too good in this place.
Rockers music don't play.
I and I will change the mood.
- The man play too much soul music.
- No, you can't say that.
I and I come to change the mood.
This is a take-over.
You're tuning to your boss DJ,
Dirty Harry.
Musical disc from the flick of my wrist to make you jump and twist.
I and I shall not remove.
As I would say.
You gots to be slick... and don't come inside here with your little funny tricks.
Man called Horsemouth.
Top-ranking drummer of J.A.
Roots. Rock. Reggae. Horsemouth.

I want you to set up this plan proper for me.
If I can, I will.

But, it's a serious problem with my father.
Me know that. You still love him.
- He's a Mafia.
- I realize that.
There's a man who set up everything for me.
Hear what happen now.
You see the night when you set up everything for the-I?
We just come in swoops upon them.
Me have the trucks set up.
So, what if him realize?
Them can't realize nothing 'bout this.

Why you so jumpy?
You think I let anything happen to you?
You no see how it go?
Well, me really scared.

- I don't know about that.
Wha'ppen? Me ready you know, Rasta.
Just leave the beer there, man.
Don't move.
This is a hold up. Gimme the key.
BREAD AND CHOCOLATE
Come on, throw it!
Independent, eh?
He doesn't need anybody to play a game. Not even an opponent.
I like that.
You speak Italian?
Why should you?
Nobody speaks it here.
Just me, because I don't know another language.
Kids are kids.
They always break your balls.
What were we saying?
Oh yes, that I like Switzerland.
And why, you'll ask?
Because it's clean.
The air, the grass...
The people mind their own business.
You say they're cold? No, they're
civilized ...that's different.
Know something?
Don't worry, madam, I'll get it.
Come on, I'll race you!
Come on!
Don't you want to come with me?
Your work permit?
I gave it to you with my passport.
I'm Giovanni Garofoli: innocent.
You're Italian.
Nobody's perfect, commissioner.
- Where do you work?
- I'm a waiter, commissioner.
I'm only temporary.
The restaurant is trying me out.
And before that?
I was a kitchen hand.
Oh, before that! I did everything.
Construction, carpentry...
I slept two years in the workers' bunkhouse.
It was absolutely wonderful there.
I mean, I had a bed there.
What else did I need?
We were too tired to even use any furniture.
- Why were you in the woods today?
- Just relaxing on my Sunday off.
Why did you run away?
I should have reported the crime.
But I didn't, partly out of tact.
After all, it's your crime.
I'm only a foreigner!
If you were me...well, being a
Commissioner, you'd call the police.
But you are the police, so why would you?
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Keep questioning me and you'll believe I'm the killer!
I'll confess, and the Turk will get the job!
What Turk?
The Turk? The restaurant only has one opening for a permanent waiter.
There are two of us trying out.
Me and a Turk.
It means everything to me.
It could change my life.
All right. You can go!
- Where to? - Go home.
Didn't you say you were innocent?
Yes, but...
- You believed me?
- Why, shouldn't I?
Yes, of course!
But...
I'm proud to work in this country...
...where you believe a man just because he's a man!
- You'll give back the ball?
- I won't worry, if you have it.
- Should I go?
- Yes, please.
Bring in the murderer.
- Did he sign a confession?
- Yes, voluntarily.
What's going on at table 8?
They've been waiting half an hour!
They ordered lamb.
Shall I go see what happened to it?
The table 6 will have to wait.
Send your busboy Gianni!
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Did you see Gianni?
Where's that son of a bitch?
Which one? There's so many here!
I'll kill him. That'll make one less!
Why the hell are you so late?
I was in the hospital.
They were insulting Italians.
I got mad and grabbed one of them...
And landed in the hospital!
I'm running up and down the stairs, doing your work...
...and you're playing the patriot!
I had three stitches!
Three stitches in three hours?
An hour a stitch?
If they throw me out because of you...
...if the Turk gets the job...
...they'll have to piece you back together with a sewing machine!
Watch out, please!
What is this, an avalanche?
Who else would it be but the Turk?
Looking for the kitchen?
The kitchen's over here,
We have fresh strawberries, today.
Your shirt...!
It's from the orange, signor Boegli.
I'll clean it right away.
Warn the gentlemen that the plates are scorching.
Serve them elegantly, please.
With style.
This is the second time
I've found a fish hidden here.
They'll think we're all thieves.
I'll take it upstairs.
Careful, Miguel, careful.
Nothing. Careful, eh?
Here it is. It has just arrived.
Why do the foreigners dislike us Italians so much?
Go see how they treat southern Italians in Milan!
I'd have gotten a life sentence there.
There are too many of us here.
2 million foreigners in a country of 5 million! An invasion!
But how would they manage without us Italians to work?
They'd get Spaniards, or Greeks, or Slavs,
They're not as pretentious and they don't waste time in the hospital!
Look at the Turk. He'd work even if they cut his hands off!
Look who's coming!
At your best, eh?
Of course, monsieur, don't you worry!
Who the hell is he?
It's a pleasure to have you back, sir.
Thanks. I'll be staying for a while.
To what do we owe the honour?
Vacation? Business?
Taxes, my friend, taxes!
The minute I step foot in
Italy, it'll cost me 3 million!
Idiot! You sit down without a seat?
This is no picnic on the grass.
It's a restaurant.
You're new here.
Giovanni Garofoli... they're trying me out.
Not bad for a try!
Anything wrong?
Everything's fine.
We're in good hands.
He's special, this guy.
Don't lose him.
We Italians have to help each other.
We're both exiles, Garofoli.
Exactly alike, sir!
There's a chair this time, don't worry.
- What are you doing there?
- Me? Nothing.
Come on, I'll buy you a coffee.
You mad at me?
If I was a little rough on you, don't be hurt.
- I could be your father. How old is he?
- Thirty-six.
I could be your grandfather.
You're young and inexperienced.
So you get into fights.
So what if somebody doesn't like Italians?
We often can't stand each other, so imagine how foreigners feel!
Feel lonely? Need company?
I'm right here.
We can work together days, and look for girls at night.
What are you up to?
She's with you?
Signor Nino, I'll tell her
I'm going with you instead.
If you've got a girl, why have coffee with me? imbecile!
On you go!
Watch him, signorina. Don't make him defend Italy's good name.
Or he'll be in the hospital every day!
Some patriot! He talks politics, meanwhile he's screwing around!
Maria, you better get up here in a hurry.
I may not be so young anymore,
But every six months at least, a man needs his wife!
It's different for a woman.
A woman is calmer.
More sentimental. She doesn't feel certain needs so strongly.
Or does she?
There she goes again...
What were you saying?
What were you saying... about the lights?
When I turn off the light at night, I feel alone, too.
This dame plays the piano and never turns off the lights.
Breaks your balls, but it's good music.
You'll really bring us to Switzerland?
He's been there 3 years now! ls he building his own train?
You think I'm telling lies?
A man who's away that long forgets his family.
- Not my Nino!
- Just you wait a couple of years!
Anyway, don't you think
I worry about it, too?
But it's you I'm here working for!
It's you I'm sweating for!
Look, I'll show you that I love you!
I'll show you and your brother!
Look!
See this?
And that's just one day's tips.
In Italy, I wouldn't see this much in 40 years.
They think I'm enjoying myself this far away!
I want my daughter to marry here and my son to grow up here!
Wait till I get that job over the Turk.
I'll bring you all here to drown in Swiss money!
A man could find something in Italy, too.
A bomb! Like the one you found poaching, that blew off your hands!
What are you laughing about?
Do you still remember your daddy?
Do you still remember daddy?
Run, run fast, or burn your ass!
Don't say "ass", Giacomo.
Ass! Ass! Up your ass!
When did he ever listen to anybody?
- You stay up pretty late, eh?
- Sometimes.
Your lights were on all last night.
The meters keep running.
- I'm afraid of the dark.
- With this peace and quiet?
It's like a cemetery.
That's just it!
I don't really understand you.
You're always so alone, so mysterious.
What are you anyway?
Turk? Yugoslav?
- Anarchic? Pianist?
- Greek.
- And you speak Italian?
- I used to teach it.
You were a professor?
And now, you're a factory worker?
In Greece, many more important people than I had to leave.
Right. Down there, you are even worse off than us.
If you ever want company, to talk, play the piano...whatever...
...just give me a call, and I'll be there.
Thanks, but I don't think that'll be necessary.
Goodnight. And down with the colonels!
Excuse me?
Down with the colonels. No good?
It's perfect!
- Goodnight, and down with them!
- Who's going to listen to you here?
Signor Nino, this is it.
They chose you.
Let's hope so.
Well, Garofoli, how are you?
Still innocent, commissioner.
What did you do Sunday?
I mean, after our talk.
You committed obscene acts in public.
Can I talk to you man-to-man?
It's been months since I thought about obscene acts, even in private!
Didn't you pee?
Well, every once in a while.
Why, is it forbidden?
In public, yes.
What pig would do it in public?
See if you recognize him.
Just a couple drops, commissioner.
I didn't even realize. It was the interrogation...the upset...
Before a woman!
With all the beauties of Switzerland, they have to photograph this?
All right, I'll pay a fine!
I'll cut it off!
You wouldn't kick me out because of this?
Not if signor Boegli renews your permit,
Without a work permit,
I can't stay in Switzerland.
How can I go back to Italy?
After three years of promises, what do I tell my family? That I peed?
Signor Boegli, you're not influenced by this nonsense, are you?
We're all like a big family here.
Tell the commissioner.
He'll tell you now.
No room, eh?
Not until Florence.
And after that, who gives a damn?
Play, paisan, play!
Tomorrow we'll be home!
I'll never look at a watch again, to forget this country.
They're all ice here. No heart!
And they've got no sea.
They can't even wash.
You don't have any sea!
Look at the sea, and you look at beauty.
What feeling it inspires!
What are you doing here?
You didn't leave?
I can't.
I can't go back to Italy like this.
I'd shoot myself first.
I just need to stay two or three days.
I'll sleep on the floor, anywhere.
I already know where to get work.
Listen, I'd like to help you, but I can't.
I don't live alone.
- Can't you explain to the gentleman...?
- No, impossible.
Why did you choose me?
The restaurant took away my room and my work papers.
- I trust you. You're a political exile.
- That's just it!
You don't have bombs here, do you?
It's an immigration policeman.
Don't hide. We'll find an excuse.
I'd throw bombs for you, but not now!
Don't worry, he's a friend.
A friend of who?
No, they've gone.
You understand now, right?
He's your son...and he doesn't have a permit to stay in Switzerland.
Not yet. If they find him, they'll make us both leave.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's like that all over.
Immigrants' closets have more kids than moths!
- Where'd you put the Swiss guy?
- I said I had to get a scan'.
Get it, then.
We'll talk when I get back.
My son is Grigory.
I'm Nino.
I'm Elena.
It's a pleasure.
The pleasure is mine.
That's why the lights are always on.
You live at night, like bats.
What should we do?
Play a game of cards?
Great idea! But let's hurry, before they make us go back in the closet.
I warn you, I'm good.
You choose the game.
Solitaire? Sorry I ever said a word!
I make great airplanes, if you have some scissors and paper.
How old are you?
How old are you?
You don't speak a word of Italian?
Well, say so!
Then I wouldn't go on like an idiot!
You're cute, though.
If only you could talk...
You're insulted?
He can't understand, but he gets insulted!
Are you crazy?
You'll get sick, you'll get drunk.
I was talking to keep you company.
I don't need you for conversation... for all you have to say!
I'll sit down in a corner.
I'll open a nice book.
I'll close it because it's in Greek.
And I'll stay here nice and quiet.
Know the song of the little bird?
I'll teach it to you.
Music, you can understand.
You'll learn right away.
One finger only.
It's pretty! The priest taught it to me when I was your age.
See how easy?
Go on, now you try.
Mama will have a nice surprise.
That's a nice tune, too!
Good morning, sir...here's our wake-up song for you!
That's enough, see you tomorrow.
Ever have musicians wake you up?
Well, I had a radio once...
No, you need live music to wake up to.
Well, pisser!
Didn't the Swiss throw you out?
But so many Italians do well here.
They open businesses...
You complain about this country, eh?
Until it's time to leave.
Blame Italy, that forces us to emigrate.
Sure, if you stay here, you have to make some little -
...sacrifice.
Meet a dear old friend.
What's your name?
- She's your wife?
- She's a whore!
Sorry, I didn't notice.
I need work, so I won't have to go back to Italy.
I'll find you all the jobs you want.
But what will you get out of it?
- Money?
- If at all possible...
You make money with money, not with work.
But if you don't have any...
How much do you have on you?
Show me.
Sorry, but I hide my money on me... for security.
After all, you never know.
So I made a little inside pocket.
My zipper got caught in my underwear.
It's stuck there.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I tore my shirt, too!
Here it is.
Guess right and double your money.
Guess wrong and you lose everything.
What do I drink in the morning?
Tea or coffee?
You better give me back my money.
I knew it, no guts!
Go back to work, then.
Coffee?
Pay him double.
Hurry up, I have to pick up my wife and kids.
You, disappear!
Leave before I get back.
- What? Putting it back in your ass?
- It's the safest place I have.
I'll have to make you all over!
After the airport,
I'll invest your money in a bank.
Your family?
How much does a plane like that cost?
It costs, it costs. Don't buy one.
Having a father like you is some advantage.
When you're born rich, you can only lose your own money.
A poor man has drive...
...a hunger for life.
You're lucky you don't have a lira.
Some luck. And just think how many of us there are!
Hey. champion!
- And where's mum? Didn't she come?
- She couldn't.
I don't know why.
I'll get their suitcases.
Handsome kids.
They look just like foreigners!
Have a nice vacation?
Want to go right home, or take a drive first?
Whatever you want, dad.
Dad, can we go right to school with Jim? Do you mind?
I don't give a good goddamn!
Maybe your wife was held up by something important.
You know, at the last minute...
Do I know her?
Was your wife ever at the Beau Rivage restaurant with you?
Oh, she's gorgeous!
Mine is too... in her own modest way, of course.
She's a shit!
Maybe that photo isn't too good...
Why did she turn against me?
Why turn my kids against me?
Oh, you mean, yours...
To her, I'm an idiot who squandered the family fortune.
My fortune, not hers!
Who put 10,000 men out of work...
As if she gave a damn about workers...!
That's my wife, sir!
Sorry, I'll have it pasted back together.
I'll do it, I just have to find all the pieces... here's a leg...
....here's an arm... here's grandma....
Want to work for me?
I need a new butler.
Someone I can trust.
You can start whenever you like.
Even tonight.
Here's Giacomo's head...
So many pieces! Like mincemeat!
You both must be crazy.
Look at the table.
Grigory decorated it.
And your millionaire“?
My money must already be in his bank.
I phoned that I'd start tomorrow.
He was sorry. He's lonely.
He'll appreciate me all the more.
Not more than we do!
Right, Grigory?
Give him to me,
I'll carry him to bed.
He's intelligent. I taught him all the bad words my son says...
He caught on right away.
So long, Mozart.
Nino's leaving you tomorrow.
Don't you have anything to say?
Up your ass...
See how fast he learns?
You go to sleep now, too.
Tomorrow's a big day for you.
You have to be in good shape.
I'm not very good with words, but...
No, it's all wrong.
You, me, the situation...
We'll say goodbye tomorrow.
I know, you're lonely, just like I am.
That's not a good enough reason.
I make you laugh, eh?
Elena, you can't give up now.
Can I come in?
May l...?
Isn't anybody home?
Butler...?
Secretary...?
They're ringing!
May l...?
Did you sleep well?
Breakfast is served.
Milk, coffee, butter, marmalade, and Nino Garofoli!
Should I open the curtains?
You don't feel well?
Don't worry, sir, I'm here!
You drank too much, eh?
What can I give him? ls there any medicine here?
No, these are just sleeping pills.
More sleeping pills...
"Nightie Naps"...
"Sleep-tite"...all empty.
My God! Sir, you didn't take all this stuff?
Butler...! Damn him!
Did he go for a doctor?
I could call and ask the restaurant for one.
The Beau Riveau Restaurant...
Bart...Barz...
Bank. ..bank. ..bank. . .there's nothing but banks in this country!
My money!
Sir, now I feel sick.
Sir, where did you deposit my money?
This may be a bad time, but while you're still here, make an effort.
You're not all that clear!
What will I tell my family? That I lent my money to a millionaire?
Will they laugh at me!
You close down factories, put 10,000 men out of work...
You get off, and I pay?
The criminal! Jail is too good for him.
They should give you the life sentence.
Even when he's dying, he's screwing someone!
Drink, and vomit.
It'll do you good.
Got a chill, sir?
Where did he go?
Oh, it's the bed. how do you stop it?
Some time for a massage!
Oh, there's nothing left.
Well, you can't die yet.
I'll bring you back to life if I have to kick your ass in.
This isn't elegant or scientific...
...but you'll wake up when I throw this in your face!
Good morning to you.
Here's your wake-up song.
And here's a cheerful toast with milk and coffee!
So you're still alive, you old bastard!
Your horse's ass!
Where've you been?
I'm glad to see your foolish fat face.
You old whore's behind!
Enough compliments!
I have to talk to you.
- What happened to your leg?
- Scaffolding...
They always give us the dangerous jobs.
I need to stay here a night or two, till I work things out.
I know it's dangerous, and that there's a guard. But if you -
But if you let me touch you,
I'll never leave your side.
Then I'll come a little closer and jump right inside!
Go on Gigi, sing, sing.
What got into you? After all we've been through together?
You at the head, and me at the foot!
You'll sleep here in my bed!
- Suppose they catch us?
- They'll think we're fags!
With that mug of yours?
Wasn't I a beautiful doll?
You have kept them?
I still have our costumes.
They're not rags, they're trophies!
Renzo, this is the guy I sang
The Three Graces with.
He's 18 and has a wife and two kids. The idiot!
- Come on, you know the song.
- Not now, Gigi, I'm bushed.
How did it go? You remember?
Who says these bunnhouses are lousy?
So what if they're freezing? It keeps the bedbugs from eating us alive!
We didn't come here out of need.
We've got enough need at home!
If a guy lets his head fall in his plate, it's not because he's tired.
It's because he's too dumb to know a plate from a pillow!
Everyone envies us. Even the Swiss.
They come to see how we're getting along. And how are we getting along?
We feel wonderful! Who cares if our wives are far away?
The administration sends us the loveliest, sexiest girls in the world.
Gentlemen, here's Gigia!
And here's the one and only Rosina!
Rosa, why don't you write to me?
If you'll just listen, we'll sing you a song.
Every day, sun or rain,
I cross the border by train.
I'm Gigia, the commuter's broad.
If you want me, I'm easy to board!
Whoever wants her can jump aboard.
Nice behind, in front even cuter, she's the emigrants' favorite commuter!
For just a couple francs as pay, we go up and down every day!
Ah, life is hard...forward and back!
But harder in the back!
Traveling, you'll find broadens your mind.
I'm Rosina and I know how to make do.
I can cook, make beds, sew...and screw!
A wonderful cook, but better to screw!
Man isn't made of wood,
dear little wife of mine.
So if I'm unfaithful to you...
What the hell can you do?
Just blame the hard luck that took me far from home.
To tell of our virtues, here's Mama!
I've imported each little creature.
Touch them and you pay duty,
They're home-grown, not exotic.
Here's your chance to be patriotic.
Swiss girls are hard to get.
No foreigner's made them yet.
Leave them alone! Don't you touch!
You've broken your ass for them, that's enough!
You'll be much better off with this native stuff!
Man isn't made of wood. ..
Dear little wife of mine...
Renzo, what's wrong?
- Nothing. I just want to go home.
- Well, you'll go home.
Like them? Humiliated here for years, and laughing about it?
We're just keeping our spirits up.
I'm sick of these dumb jokes.
Let him be. He's hysterical.
No, he's right! They've screwed us all our lives with a song and a guitar.
And we're still singing!
We've been had.
We have to change things, not sing about them.
I could vomit every time
I hear "sun" and "sea"!
These whores won't let me sleep!
Go on, sleep.
But it's time to wake up!
Look at yourself in the mirror, bitch!
- You call me that?
- Who else?
Can a paisan offer you a ray of light?
A job, with no documents required?
Only 10% the first three months...
Trust a paisan...healthy, outdoor work, and no documents needed!
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
I won't tell you.
Me neither.
And so we're through.
Our paisan sent me.
It's the guy with no papers!
Don't worry, none of us have papers.
We're all one, big family.
You raise chickens?
No, we get them full grown.
We only kill them, bless the Madonna.
Look how beautiful!
Come, I'll show you how it all works.
Every job is done with love!
Here, you put in the head and chop it off. Watch your hand...
This is the steam machine. Beautiful!
And here, the feathers come off.
It's like a party!
At night, you go to sleep with a clear conscience...
...thanking God, and blessing the Madonna.
Even without any feathers, these creatures seem almost human.
- Let's go eat. Aren't you hungry?
- What do you earn a day?
They're always playing.
It's a piece work. The more you kill, the more you earn.
We get up when the cock crows...
You kill him...
...and, thank God, we start another day...
...blessing the Madonna!
Our house is right there.
But that's a chicken coop.
There are no chickens there now.
It's still a chicken coop.
It's not a chicken coop if there aren't any chickens!
The owner offered us a house, but we'd have to pay rent.
This one is completely free.
Look how nice it is, thank God.
That's Mimmo.
My married nephew sleeps here.
Salvatore and his wife, here... each one has his own little apartment.
And Mimmo sleeps alone.
How do you do without women?
I manage.
And where do I sleep?
There in that mess, or with Mimmo.
In that mess.
Why not make a hole in the roof so you could stand up sometimes?
Look at the table and chairs.
Sawed in half!
You're new here, son.
Little by little, you'll get used to it.
And never stand up again.
That's the Madonna of Pompei.
If I bowed down lower, it'd seem like adulation!
Well, do you like our house?
Maybe if you really searched, you'd find a place like this in Italy.
Maybe.
But we couldn't make as good money.
Oh, we don't spend any of it.
We have all we need.
It's all put aside for a rainy day.
Here are our women...
Daughter, mother, and niece.
You didn't saw them in half.
No, they fit just right!
Don't grow anymore or they'll throw you out.
He's already 12 years old.
A big bruiser! Do you go to school?
To a German school?
No, he can't understand.
If he did, he'd kill himself.
He only knows the language of the chickens.
Hear how well he does it?
Do it again for Nino!
No, once is enough!
Look at Michele!
Do it like Michele!
Isn't he just like a real chicken?
I hesitated to say it...
Make a toast, Nino!
I'd like to ask one question.
All right, but on your feet!
Are you insulted?
At this point...
That's enough! Let him go on.
Just one question...
Who am I?
He doesn't know who he is?
He said Nino Garofoli,
Maybe he forgot!
You're Italian and I'm Italian.
But is that enough to make us alike? Am I like you?
If I went out with Mimmo...
...who's content to live in a place like this...
...what would people say?
That we're alike?
My son, why worry about what people say?
People are envious!
Well then, I ask you, how do you see me?
Michele, how do you see me?
Tell me!
The same as us...exactly the same.
Nino, come see!
Where are we going?
To see what?
They're the owners' children, with their friends.
Beautiful, eh?
Beautiful!
Sir, the public baths close at 6!
Dark or light?
This guy doesn't know what the hell he wants!
I'm Italian! So what?
You don't like it?
The Italians will win this game 7 to 0!
Go on, threaten me!
That's what I'm here for!
I'll say whatever I like!
I understand what I'm saying!
Move forward, signora.
These young kids, they see fine from this distance.
Even without glasses...
I can't go to the hospital!
Are you all right, amigo?
Did they hurt you?
What language is that?
Aren't you German?
Spanish, senior!
Would you believe it...?
You're to be across the frontier by midnight.
With pleasure. All my best!
Sorry, but it just came over me.
I'm Italian!
Sorry, signora. It was my hand!
It's not allowed here!
Well, I'll pee later, out the window!
So long, sergeant.
Thanks for everything!
Write me sometime, handsome!
Is there a small place for a guy who can't find a place anywhere?
Do they want me?
What's your name?
Then it's probable!
What would they want?
Maybe it's good news.
In German? Impossible!
Right. Remember, you haven't seen me.
Who even knows you?
Who is he, anyway?
Are you all right, Nino?
Didn't you hear the loudspeaker?
Yes, but I didn't understand very well.
You look so funny.
I cut myself.
Half blond and half brunette...
That's me. Neither here nor there.
It's hard to explain all that's happened.
I know. Rudiger told me.
Remember my friend?
When you hid in the closet?
Oh, the Swiss cop.
You still see him?
I married him.
Then you still see him.
He's a good man.
If the Pope picks them as his guards, they must have some qualities.
He gave me this for you.
It's a residency permit.
You can stay another six months, and find any work you like.
Nino, aren't you pleased?
There's no end to it!
They just kicked me out!
It was all over!
You try everything, you fight...
...but when you lose - at least you get a rest!
So, you'd rather go back to Italy?
You just want to go away?
Then what do you want?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because my head hurts...
Listen to me, Nino. The problem isn't Italy or
Switzerland. Choose any country.
Choose whatever you like.
But choose to live!
Don't give up now.
Don't ever give up!
Tell that to Grigory.
What has he got to do with it?
He still remembers me?
He often talks about you.
Well, tell it to him.
But he's only a child.
That's just it. He can use it.
I'm tired, Elena. I don't have the heart for it.
The train is leaving..
You're very kind, Elena.
Thanks for thinking of me,
Come on, you don't need to die too..
What should I tell Rudigge?
He wanted so much to help you!
I don't know what to say, I don't even know him!
He likes the flowers?
Oh, no, flowers for a policeman...
Damn it, if you arrived a little later
 it shouldn't have been this problem!
Why did he mixed up?
Tell him you didn't find me!
Tell him what do you want, for me it's the same!
Say hello to Grigori!
- Nino!
- Yes?
All we need is the sun!
All we need is the sea!
The girl of my heart and a song to sing!
Whether you gained...
Whether you lost...
Let's forget the past...
We're from Naples, paisan!
Come on Ranjeet, it's your turn.
I'm thinking what I'm going to be doing.
You have been thinking for five minutes.
Patience
We are playing scrabblo not patience.
- What do you want Su Lee? okay, here we go.
Full cycle to win.
Very good. Bravo.
Right. It's your turn now Zoltan.
Hey. Attention. Zoltan's turn.
It's all right. You throw
I'm no bad. What you want
- You are getting better
- Yes?
- You are starting to hit the board. - Good.
What happened?
You are supposed to throw it forward not to the backwards.
Where is it?
It's alright. I see it.
Oh me.
It's a good thing you were wearing a turban Ranjeet otherwise it would have gone straight through your head.
Oh, blimey! You wouldn't have felt it.
You will feel my first in a moment.
Come on Ranjeet.
I'm still thinking.
Yeah, Shiks are slow thinkers.
Shut up man.
We must have time limito. Come.
Oh, I'm getting a good one.
Sugar.
No goodo.
Quel idiot! Sugar is not spelled S-H-U-G-A-R.
I think you are mistaken.
You damn fool. Everybody know sugar is spelled with two Gs.
We win! You want game Juan?
We no have time. Mr. Brown he will be here pretty soon!
You frighten you lose?
I bet you blind folded.
Let's see you get double the top with Your eyes closed.
Easy. Easy.
Closed.
One, two,
Jamila.
Who did this?
Me. I was trying to get that in top.
Looks like you get it in the bottom.
Are you hurt Sid?
Huh?
Did it hurt?
You bend down and you'll find out.
- What is going on in here?
- Not a thing.
- A dart game.
- I beg your pardon.
Sid was us telling how he used to dart playing.
Well in future Sidney, kindly remember that the students have more important things to do, did you get my point?
Yeah, and his point as well.
- Good heavens!
- What's the matter?
This door is full of holes.
Maybe it's a wooden worm.
Wood warm.
Yeah, it's alright.
Yes. I just had a telephone call from Mr. Brown.
He says he would be along later.
Apparently, he is tied up at his flat.
Oh, blimey. Shouldn't we be going to untie him?
I was speaking metaphorically.
It is better you speako English.
Silence. Now Mr. Brown may put up with you stupid remarks but I assure you will find me a very different kettle of fish.
Excuse me please, what is mean kettle of fish?
You'll find out. Now, until Mr. Brown
Arrives, I intend to find out what sort of progress you are making.
You, how are you doing?
How are you doing?
Very pleased, thank you.
How are you doing?
I'm inquiring about your English.
Your English
No, no, Hungarian.
You're hopeless.
No, no, look Hungarian.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You. Give me the present of the verb to move.
You know it not?
Well, of course I know it.
Oh good, then you can me tell?
It is not my place to tell you anything.
Okay, then you can tell me not.
- You! - Sí, señora.
What is a comma?
Por favor.
What is a comma?
Comma is when you are unconscious.
That's a comma. A comma is a punctuation mark.
Oh, it's alright.
I don't think Mr. Brown is teaching you anything.
Master is teaching us very much English.
When I am arrived, not one body is understand me, now everybody is understand every thing I am speak.
I see. Well, then in that case, if someone will stop you in the street and ask you the time what would you say?
That's wouldn't help them!
Oh yes, in my street, it's all Indian peoples.
Silence. You!
Yes please.
Give ma a collective noun for a collection of ants.
Aunties.
Not aunts. Ants. Insects.
What is a lot of ants?
I don't use that.
Have you never heard of swarm?
Yes please. England call
Pakistan a swarm.
Silence.
Oh sorry I'm late Miss Courtney.
So am I! I have just been seeing how your students are getting on.
- Well, I think they're progressing.
- Yes, but in which direction?
What have you been saying?
Nothing, she is asking some questions and we are telling her some answers.
Well, that explains it.
Are you going away?
Only for one night. I'm having my flat painted that's why I can't sleep there.
You're having your bed painted also?
No, just I can't stand the smell of fresh glass paint.
Where would you be sleeping tonight?
I'll probably stay at the YMCA.
Hey, much better that the YWCA.
I suppose any of you have a spare room, do you?
It would give me much pleasure for you to share my humble house, but unfortunately, my cousin and his family and also his cousin and his family are staying with me.
You've got two families both living in one house?
Two families both living in one room.
You are very welcome to come and Stay with me.
Have you got a spare room?
No. But I have a very big bed.
Well, thank you for the offer but
I thing it'd better be in the YMCA.
- You can with me stay. - Don't tell me you've got a very big bed also?
No. I have a small bed, better much.
Okay, you stay with us.
Who's Huss? Us?
Me and Giovanni.
Sure we've got a room.
I didn't know you share a flat.
Yeah, I had to leave my other place.
I had a big fight with the neighbor because of the noise.
What noise?
Every night after mid night guitar practice for one hour.
- Surely you can ask them to stop. - No.
- Why not? - It's me who practice the guitar.
And you still practice the guitar, do you?
- No, finish guitar.
- Thanks goodness for that.
Now I practice the drums.
What?
That's a joke. I don't practice anything. What do you say?
- Will you stay with us?
- Well, I am
Okay, you stay. Hey, why don't we have a party.
That's a good idea.
Everybody comes.
I'll bring a bottle.
Yeah, make it sure it's not empty.
I'll bottle bring.
We'll get us a pizza.
Chicken curry.
Fried rice.
Noodles.
Salata.
Guiash.
German sausage.
Paella valencian style.
Duck.
We'll give you a night you'll never forget.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Well, come in professor.
Oh, thank you.
This is the hall, this is the kitchen, this is my bedroom, Max's bedroom, this is the Living room, and this
And that's my bedroom.
No, that's the bathroom.
Oh, where am I sleeping?
You sleep here on the sofa.
Sure, it's very comfortable.
What was that?
What was what?
That awful noise.
It's only a train.
Only a train! This is worse then the waiting room of Waterloo station.
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
They only run every ten minutes after rush hour finish.
I'll never get to sleep through all that noise.
We'll give you cotton ball to put in your ears.
Well, I would need it.
Hey, we better go get the drinks.
You wanna come with us professor?
Well actually I'd like a bath if that's alright with you?
Okay, we'll be back in 10 minutes.
I left them here on the table.
Where is professor?
- Well he said he was going to have a bath. - Okay, come on. Alright.
Just a moment.
Hello! Max! Giovanni!
Anybody there?
The sergeant! Yes madame!
A burgler. Don't panic.
Stay where you are and I'll send a police car around right way.
- He's trying to pick next door's lock.
- Don't worry, I'll sort him out.
Oh, I do hope this sort of thing doesn't happen often.
I only moved in here yesterday.
Stand back, I'm going out there.
George, you stay with Mrs. Partridge.
Alright, come quietly.
- Oh, look you're making a mistake.
- Could be.
No but I'm staying here with a friend.
What's the address?
I don't know. I've never been here before, you see?
I see.
Look there's a perfectly simple explanation
Well, why don't we come down to the station
And tell it to the perfectly simple sergeant.

{12461}{12561}- I think she's upset.|- I don't see why.
{12576}{12626}We've been a bit inconsiderate.
{12635}{12683}But there's nothing between us...
{12729}{12796}I like you a lot.|That's the way it goes.
{12800}{12856}Not with me. Virginia|is my best friend.
{12880}{12935}She's mine too, but what can we do?
{12946}{12996}It's stupid. I don't want to hurt her.
{13003}{13062}- Should I talk to her?|- No, I'll go.
{13235}{13271}You're unhappy I came, right?
{13282}{13361}You should have stayed with him.
{13368}{13435}I mean on the trip with you two.
{13440}{13477}Why should you care?
{13485}{13598}How can you say that?|Have you forgotten?
{13604}{13666}I'm your best friend.|Your confidante.
{13696}{13733}I'm sorry, Betty.
{13747}{13802}I don't know what's the matter.
{13810}{13880}I don't know why I'm like this.
{13889}{14016}It's alright. It doesn't really matter.
{14030}{14094}It's because you're still the same|frightened child...
{14099}{14163}Who used to come trembling|at my door...
{14168}{14256}...to ask my advice|about so many things.
{14262}{14330}I don't want to talk about that.
{14346}{14445}I'll never forget.|And you haven't forgotten me.
{14452}{14527}Remember the things I taught you.
{18920}{18956}Your ticket, please.
{18996}{19036}The man in the last car has it.
{19043}{19101}Very well. Enjoy your trip.
{19112}{19190}Excuse me, where is the next stop?
{19199}{19253}There's no stop before Guarda.
{19268}{19332}Could you stop the train?|I want to get off.
{19338}{19382}It's against the rules.
{19386}{19439}Besides, there's nothing here.
{19468}{19498}There must be a village nearby.
{19501}{19541}Not for miles.
{19572}{19579}Thanks.
{19591}{19613}Sorry.
{20596}{20629}Virginia!
{20641}{20693}Are you crazy?
{20786}{20884}Virginia stop! Please come back!
{20913}{20949}What are you doing?
{20956}{20972}I'm stopping the train.
{20979}{21005}You can't stop here.
{21009}{21034}Didn't you hear the alarm?
{21040}{21058}Never mind!
{21064}{21098}Look!
{21288}{21321}Have fun!
{21520}{21565}She doesn't know what she's in for.
{21570}{21588}What do you mean?
{21592}{21651}Nothing, just shovel more coal.
{26303}{26360}Is anyone there?
{26381}{26413}Anyone?
{53734}{53799}I called Lisbon, she didn't get back.
{53804}{53833}You think she's lost?
{53837}{53865}Would you like breakfast?
{53868}{53903}The bill, please.
{53950}{54002}Is there a village near here?
{54010}{54141}There is nothing between|here and Lisbon.
{54179}{54218}But we saw something|from the train.
{54225}{54325}You mean Berzano. It's been|deserted for over 100 years.
{54332}{54393}Maybe our friend stayed the night?
{54476}{54536}I'm sorry, sir. How clumsy.
{54548}{54581}What about Berzano?
{54587}{54659}- I don't know, but they say...|- What?
{54668}{54737}The hotel doesn't want us|to talk about it.
{54743}{54858}They're old wives tales that|scare tourists away.
{54865}{54883}Go on.
{54888}{54947}Please... I don't want to lose my job.
{54998}{55026}Excuse me.
{55089}{55151}Anything wrong sir?|Do you have a complaint?
{55156}{55178}No, everything's fine.
{55183}{55213}Where can I rent a horse?
{55221}{55288}We have a riding range.
{55294}{55359}I don't want a range.|I want to ride out.
{55363}{55436}You'll find the area very beautiful.
{55441}{55467}I'd like a horse too.
{55469}{55493}I'd rather go alone.
{55497}{55566}- I should go too.|- Who knows what we'll find.
{55568}{55607}I also want to know.
{55640}{55667}You're going to Berzano?
{55671}{55736}Yes, and to hell with|your superstitions!
{56033}{56069}It's the girl! She needs help!
{56072}{56158}Let's get out of here.|The police will deal with it.
{57276}{57307}There's no trace of her.
{58140}{58177}This is quite a place.
{60015}{60050}How are we going to get back?
{60075}{60101}The best bet is the train.
{60105}{60135}If they'll stop.
{60141}{60176}Leave that to me.
{60221}{60274}What frightened the horses?
{60288}{60328}A snake or something.
{60365}{60425}Look, a medieval cemetery!
{60465}{60499}Something's odd.
{60544}{60577}The whole thing's odd.
{60587}{60627}I can't make it out.
{60690}{60725}Look at those crosses.
{60759}{60812}They're unusual.
{60840}{60885}They're Egyptian.
{60897}{61025}In medieval witch trials they were|used for black arts.
{61028}{61127}Let's go, please.|This place is too creepy.
{61140}{61193}We must look for Virginia.
{62072}{62144}She must have left when|she saw all this.
{62202}{62233}She must be here.
{62387}{62407}Virginia!
{62534}{62575}Virginia!
{62858}{62881}Look!
{63146}{63181}That means she's here.
{63672}{63704}Her shoe.
{63759}{63799}It's all very strange.
{63928}{63966}Virginia, are you here?
{64001}{64035}Virginia, is that you?
{64198}{64233}What are you doing here?
{64283}{64366}We're looking for a friend|who was here all night.
{64372}{64421}Is it your friend Virginia White?
{64431}{64462}Yes. Who are you?
{64466}{64525}Police officer Marcos,|Inspector Oliviera.
{64550}{64571}What happened?
{64573}{64600}Where's Virginia?
{64623}{64659}How did you get out here?
{64669}{64753}We rented a couple of horses.|They ran away.
{64771}{64856}Then you must be Elizabeth Turner|and Roger Wholen.
{64869}{64895}That's right.
{64911}{64993}You were at the Hotel Flores and|left this morning.
{65000}{65037}How do you know?
{65047}{65156}Our police station isn't exactly|modern but we have phones.
{65162}{65209}What happened to Virginia?
{65307}{65350}Your friend has been murdered.
{65363}{65421}No! I'm to blame for this.
{65464}{65555}It's not your fault.|Nobody could have forseen this.
{65560}{65601}We need you to identify the body.
{65677}{65717}Please come in.
{65847}{65885}It's not a pretty sight.
{66345}{66400}Come on, go on.
{66641}{66716}Not her. The girl from today.
{66760}{66782}Yes, sir.
{67510}{67531}Here.
{67655}{67697}Who could have done it?
{67702}{67729}Anything new?
{67757}{67802}I haven't performed the autopsy.
{67805}{67854}But this case is strange.
{67879}{67941}As if wild animals had attacked her.
{67949}{67984}She looked tortured.
{67993}{68061}There was very little damage.
{68072}{68106}What killed her?
{68116}{68163}- She bled to death.|- Was she raped?
{68167}{68277}No, Inspector, it wasn't a|sexual assault, I can assure you.
{68287}{68335}The work of a sadist.
{68341}{68493}Sadist judging by the different bite|marks. At least a dozen persons.
{68567}{68673}It sounds crazy, but I think|it was a death ritual.
{68695}{68803}Impossible! Black masses|are a thing of the past.
{68820}{68876}Forget it, this is the 20th century.
{69124}{69220}What are you doing?|That wig doesn't go.
{69259}{69377}You're right. I can't concentrate.|I feel horrible.
{69391}{69463}Forget your friend and|concentrate on your work.
{69468}{69504}Easier said than done.
{69525}{69562}You should have seen her.
{69586}{69617}It was awful.
{69699}{69775}You need a vacation.|A change of scenery.
{69827}{69917}Maybe, but not until I know what|happened to Virginia.
{69935}{69972}Leave it alone.
{70075}{70134}You know about Berzano, don't you?
{70191}{70239}I don't want to talk about it.
{70310}{70354}Open the door. That must be Roger.
{70396}{70425}Let him in.
{70885}{70918}Is Betty in?
{70924}{70957}She's expecting you.
{71113}{71149}Strange lighting in here.
{71157}{71189}It's from the skylight.
{71195}{71277}It's from a neon sign on the roof.
{71304}{71330}It must be annoying.
{71332}{71361}It doesn't bother us.
{71507}{71519}Hi, Betty.
{71526}{61599}This place is hard to find.
{71628}{71654}You wanted to see me.
{71655}{71749}My assistant lived in a village|40 miles from Berzano.
{71807}{71842}What is this place?
{71884}{71935}I left when I was very young.
{71943}{72013}You must have heard things as a child.
{72027}{72061}I don't know anything.
{72080}{72147}We really need your help.
{72355}{72441}There was this legend they told us|when we were bad.
{72449}{72520}It was silly, I suppose but it still|frightened us.
{72546}{72583}What legend?
{72595}{72684}Berzano is haunted by ancient|Knight Templars.
{72693}{72829}They worshipped the devil and were|excommunicated...
{72843}{72899}What does that have to do|with the murder?
{72921}{72997}The dead Templars come|out at night and "hunt"...
{73016}{73033}Hunt?
{73048}{73101}Hunt humans and drink their blood.
{73580}{73616}You guys are late.
{73619}{73681}The doc took extra|time with this one.
{73713}{73749}Anything interesting?
{73753}{73805}Nothing except the bites.
{73828}{73859}Who could have done this?
{73867}{73937}She asked for it, dressed like that.
{73955}{74025}They want to be bitten. She did.
{75339}{75404}What's the matter, are you scared?
{75418}{75489}There, there, calm down.
{75918}{75990}And you, you think I've forgotten you?
{76010}{76081}Let's play a little...
{78580}{78662}DIAS UTEIS 8 AS 19 H|MINIST蒖IO DA EDUCAC罯NACIONAL
{78784}{78795}Let's rush.
{79415}{79447}Professor Cantal?
{79566}{79620}Yes, what do you want?
{79634}{79755}The library is closed to the public.
{79761}{79826}Excuse us, Professor, a|friend's been murdered.
{79831}{79891}What do you want from me?|Go to the police.
{79895}{79936}You're an authority on the Middle Ages.
{79944}{80006}We'd like to know about the Templars|and their rituals.
{80046}{80069}I don't understand.
{80078}{80133}Our friend was murdered at Berzano.
{80143}{80254}Berzano? The Templars are back?|That's great!
{80263}{80288}He's mad!
{80295}{80332}We're not 100% sure.
{80363}{80407}I'll tell you.
{80651}{80679}Here it is.
{80710}{80774}The Templars brought back|treasures from the East...
{80777}{80832}...where they also learned black magic.
{80842}{80912}For that they were excommunicated.
{80927}{81049}Their history is fascinating and their|mysteries remain unfathomable.
{81056}{81096}And you think...
{81168}{81273}In the 13th century Berzano was the|seat of the Templar hierarchy.
{81305}{81395}They were lords and masters of the area.
{81531}{81664}Documents from their trial show that|they returned from the Holy Land...
{81672}{81787}...bearing the cross of the Egyptian|Pharaohs, symbol of eternal life.
{81812}{81909}They held Satanic rituals|in their quest for immortality.
{81938}{82020}Meanwhile they oppressed|their serfs and tenants...
{82028}{82095}And appropriated vast territories.
{82100}{82174}They were both hated and feared.
{84479}{84535}Let us carry out the sacrifice.
{84542}{84682}Commence the ritual and may the blood|lend us life beyond the grave.
{87984}{88035}They were tried and many bore witness|against them.
{88039}{88111}Further evidence proved their guilt.
{88143}{88177}They were sentenced to death.
{88182}{88290}Their bodies were strung up for|public display...
{88298}{88367}...until the crows plucked|out their eyes.
{88398}{88440}Is that true?
{88450}{88559}Absolutely. The archives|date a thousend years.
{88566}{88623}What are you trying to say?
{88629}{88699}That some new sect is|practicing these old rituals?
{88707}{88767}- No, no, I wouldn't say that.|- What then?
{88771}{88827}They're the old Templars,|come back to life.
{88833}{88864}That's nonsense.
{88872}{88955}Nonsense? You think science|has all the answers?
{88960}{89117}The Templars brought back many|secrets, including that of eternal life.
{89126}{89156}That's impossible!
{89162}{89241}What about voodoo?|And the legend of Faust?
{89247}{89325}All who make pacts with Satan,|do so with blood.
{89354}{89448}The Templars consumated their|sacrificial offerings...
{89453}{89516}...with the blood of a maiden.
{89566}{89620}Now the dead are waking...
{89630}{89730}...and although they have no eyes,|they can hear their victims...
{89736}{89816}...and continue their offerings|to the God of evil.
{89823}{89880}That's what many would like to think.
{89942}{89974}Who's there?
{90018}{90036}It's me, Professor.
{90052}{90146}Your story is intriguing,|but more like a fairy tale.
{90178}{90271}Believe what you want, but I'm going.|I'm a very busy man.
{90282}{90318}Wait a moment.
{90328}{90402}You have a son by the name of Pedro?
{90450}{90551}That's right, why?
{90573}{90621}Where is Pedro now?
{90680}{90767}I don't know, he left two years ago.
{90814}{90856}I haven't heard from him since.
{90861}{90904}I can tell you, Professor.
{90925}{91062}He lives in a boat on the river|Guardiana, near Spain.
{91091}{91148}He's the boss of a gang of smugglers.
{91165}{91218}I don't want to know.
{91223}{91271}What's this all about?
{91278}{91348}That village is 6 miles from Berzano.
{91355}{91402}What do you mean by that?
{91408}{91482}Those criminals use superstitious|legends to their advantage.
{91488}{91526}They killed Virginia?
{91535}{91658}They want to scare people away|from their territory.
{91671}{91713}That's terrible.
{91718}{91771}My son is not a killer.
{91849}{91891}Why tell us this?
{91897}{91996}The morgue attendant is dead and|Virginia's body is missing.
{92002}{92062}This is becoming a nightmare.
{92067}{92163}Be very careful.|Your shop is near the morgue.
{92172}{92258}We'll be watching, but be careful.
{93147}{93289}Nina, don't wait for me.|I'll be away until tomorrow.
{93302}{93386}I need you to deliver the last order.
{93526}{93635}Take it to the Consalvas store|17 Signal Street.
{93755}{93785}I've got it.
{94036}{94105}A signed receipt, yes.
{94122}{94177}Make sure you lock the door.
{94190}{94260}Just be careful.
{94293}{94339}Because we're in danger.
{94341}{94486}Yes, I'll tell you later. Bye.
{98166}{98218}Hello! Hello!...
{98269}{98350}...help me, please! Oh, my God!
{100635}{100675}This is as close as I go.
{100679}{100730}I understand.
{100737}{100765}They're dangerous.
{100767}{100803}Can I come?
{100806}{100899}You stay here. If I'm not back in 30|minutes, call the police.
{101026}{101100}In 30 minutes, we leave.
{101668}{101701}Is Pedro Cantal here?
{101704}{101729}No, sir.
{101734}{101762}Get him.
{102377}{102449}It's nothing, don't go.
{102454}{102485}I must.
{102516}{102562}Could be the police.
{102585}{102639}You've done this to me before.
{102655}{102707}You know the heat's on!
{102753}{102905}You're going to Amalia, but why|should I care?
{103016}{103071}Other men like me.
{103074}{103127}You have a one track mind.
{103377}{103423}What's the problem?
{103428}{103493}Someone's here asking for you.
{103518}{103552}I'm coming.
{104031}{104102}You want to see him|naked, you tramp?
{104216}{104287}One day they'll get me,|but it won't be a woman!
{104292}{104353}At least then I'll know|where you are at night.
{105463}{105490}Police?
{105496}{105535}No, I'm not.
{105563}{105623}It's OK boys, he's harmless.
{105747}{105774}What do you want?
{105780}{105807}I'd like to know about Berzano.
{105810}{105885}Why come to me? I know nothing.
{105889}{105907}Didn't you hear what happened?
{105910}{105945}Not interested.
{105958}{106004}My friend was brutally murdered there.
{106007}{106031}Why tell me?
{106034}{106087}- The police suspects your gang.|- But why?
{106094}{106162}- To scare off people.|- I see.
{106180}{106257}We've been here for years.|No one bothers us.
{106260}{106334}We're small time smugglers.
{106348}{106414}You think we're the killers?
{106440}{106459}No.
{106462}{106487}How was she killed?
{106493}{106539}Stay out of this. What can I do?
{106542}{106576}Help me, and yourself.
{106579}{106615}Fine with me. How?
{106621}{106668}I want to clear up my friend's murder.
{106675}{106697}How?
{106706}{106760}Come with me to Berzano.
{106771}{106834}I can't. I've got my work here.
{106850}{106923}Very wise. I'd do the same|in your shoes.
{106930}{106960}When do we leave?
{106963}{107021}Right now. We'll spend|the night in Berzano.
{107031}{107093}What? You're going to sleep there?
{107097}{107141}Why? You scared?
{107146}{107189}Allright, I'll go.
{107193}{107223}I'm going with you.
{107506}{107532}What's up?
{107536}{107557}Nothing.
{107585}{107651}- Are you armed?|- Yes.
{107716}{107780}Leave that for the ladies - here.
{107822}{107849}And you?
{107866}{107926}I know how to handle this.
{108009}{108067}A drink will give you strength.
{108107}{108147}How polite!
{108221}{108245}Hey, save some for us!
{108249}{108300}It's all mine after all.
{108307}{108328}I'm going to look around.
{108331}{108352}Should I go with you?
{108354}{108399}You think I need a bodyguard?
{108405}{108469}Not if there are two of us.
{108472}{108562}I said I'd come but I don't|have to put up with you.
{108565}{108633}Just do what you want,|but leave me out of it.
{108638}{108718}He's as soft as a porcupine!
{108750}{108789}Want to come with me?
{108793}{108862}Are you kidding?|She's not your type.
{108866}{108901}I'd like that...
{108996}{109039}Behave yourselves.
{109132}{109258}Pedro likes your girl.|She sure jumped at it.
{109290}{109350}She's just going for a walk.
{109370}{109423}You expect her to be faithful?
{109434}{109466}She's not my girl.
{109473}{109535}She'll soon be Pedro's.
{109558}{109594}You don't know Betty!
{109604}{109642}As if I care!
{109702}{109763}You've got to take what comes...
{109790}{109847}...and you look passable enough.
{109939}{109970}Here, drink.
{109974}{109994}What is it?
{109999}{110019}Rum.
{110119}{110234}Go on, we'll have a party.
{111041}{111072}Let's keep walking.
{111078}{111126}We shouldn't go too far.
{111135}{111163}Do you miss him?
{111171}{111187}Who?
{111192}{111227}That guy in there.
{111233}{111279}He's just a friend.
{111304}{111366}That makes it more interesting.
{111659}{111767}Not bad. Pretty boys|don't normally excite me.
{111782}{111811}Let's go for a walk.
{111815}{111875}So you don't trust them after all?
{111908}{111937}You're so suspicious.
{111941}{112058}OK, anyplace will do when you're hot.
{112090}{112205}Better if I keep this. I hope|we won't have to use it.
{112572}{112624}They're hiding.
{112629}{112687}They are around somewhere.
{112700}{112755}What do you think they're doing?
{112779}{112820}Having a look around.
{112853}{112949}You really think so? Strange boy.
{113773}{113811}What are you thinking?
{113818}{113856}I'm going back.
{114222}{114243}Why?
{114298}{114368}I've never been interested in men.
{114390}{114438}You mean you've never...
{114541}{114615}I had a bad experience as a child.
{114623}{114643}I can change all that.
{114645}{114724}Please don't! No, I beg you!
{116699}{116805}We're going to walk all night|looking for your girl?
{116814}{116843}I hardly know her.
{116848}{116896}But you have the hots for her.
{116910}{116929}Cigarette?
{116934}{117039}You're sure a gentleman,|but I prefer rougher men.
{117361}{117384}This was Virginia's.
{117388}{117425}The dead girl?
{117454}{117483}How did she lose it?
{117486}{117561}I knew a guy who drank|champagne from my shoe.
{117565}{117598}That turned him on.
{117627}{117655}Let's go.
{117662}{117719}Wait! What's got into you?
{119159}{119221}Who are you? I'm not afraid!
{119325}{119413}Come out, whoever you are!
{121376}{121396}Where's Pedro?
{121400}{121461}I left him in the cemetery.
{121481}{121576}Get inside, bolt the door and don't|open it for anyone.
{124885}{124974}So you and Pedro went for a walk.|Have any fun?
{125512}{125534}Who is it?
{125545}{125611}It's Roger. Open the door!
{125621}{125637}Where's Pedro?
{125644}{125675}The Templars killed him.
{125680}{125724}A likely story. Don't open.
{125728}{125763}But he's in danger.
{125768}{125868}- What about us? They'll get us!|- I'm opening.
{125910}{125951}If you open the door, I'll kil you.
{125989}{126022}What's happening?
{126533}{126604}Open the door! It's me, Roger!
{126662}{126697}They're coming!
{126966}{127000}Open it!
{128707}{128729}Slut!
{130358}{130481}You'll be safe if you|don't make any sound.
{135815}{135840}Stop!
{136221}{136253}Dad, look!
{137041}{137063}Wait!
{137078}{137153}Please help me!
{137774}{137795}Quickly!
{137816}{137851}Let's go!!
{137910}{137935}Son!!
{143258}{143323}What are you doing there?
{143521}{143552}What's the matter?
{143829}{143853}What happened?
{143898}{143965}Don't speak now. We'll talk inside.

Warning: The following documentary contains spoilers
'Surrealism Or Extremism'
I was working as a television announcer when I met Alberto...
He was looking for an actress for a commercial...
Commercials were great back then.
I made a commercial for
Dulciora with Alberto...
And one for San Pellegrino.
We met.
We liked each other...
So he split up with his girlfriend, and I left my boyfriend...
And five months later we got married.
A wonderful romance.
And then, not even nine months later, we had a child together.
And we started to make films together.
I stopped working with other directors...
And I was his actress.
I was his assistant on 'Quickly'
The shooting title was
'The Kid Who Made Vesuvius Erupt'.
It was a musical but they were going out of fashion so he stopped working on it...
Then he utilised various scenes to make 'Quickly...'
And I was his assistant.
Then, when he went back to it, he asked me to do the photography...
And I gave up everything and started working for Alberto.
Maurizio Centini introduced me to him, many years ago.
And I got to know him because
Alberto loved old things...
I also worked in this field, with antiques...
Also in the cinema.
We got on very well.
What can you say...
I thought he was a splendid person.
Can you give me a light?
Want to come back to my place?
I can give you something to eat.
Then we can listen to some records.
I'm not hungry.
How did Spell come about?
Well...
I moved my family to a village called Caste Nuovo...
And, after five or six years of living in this place, Castel Nuovo...
Where I had seen these provincial parties, these village parties, etc...
I hadn't seen anything like it...
And I had heard that this party was the reason for everything.
It really was...
It still had the function...
...of a medieval carnival.
To have the possibility to
 put everything on display.
Without fear, because it was permitted.
During that period he struck up a close friendship...
With a community in this small village...
With all the...
As I said before, the merits...
And all the faults.
You just had to scratch the surface...
Not only there.
But in many places.
Yes, in fact the film was very well received by the provincial public...
Possibly because they identified with it, or recognised themselves in it.
But it wasn't well received in the cities.
Look who it is!
The Conquistador!
There's a funeral scene in the film.
That was a real funeral...
It wasn't a staged funeral, it was a real funeral.
When the film came out,
I was terrified...
Because I knew everyone in Castel
Nuovo would go and see the film.
So, the next day...
At the premiere in Rome, 
I kept my head down, etc...
But they all congratulated each other! they were happy with how they appeared...
Because they were all characters that really did exist.
A little exaggerated, perhaps.
But a lot of them recognised themselves.
No one complained.
Except for the priest...
Who was really pissed.
I like to make films that
 are quite explicit.
When I wanted to do a reverse shot
I asked the priest to stop the funeral...
To give us time to move the camera.
He never forgave me for that.
Alberto wasn't extreme.
He was obstinate about some things...
And his beliefs.
That's true.
But Alberto's extremism was centred on his challenging of the world around him.
Sometimes it's good to see what we look like inside.
Illusions disappear and you're left with the reality.
Which, believe me, is the only medicine you need to survive.
Dreaming won't get you anywhere.
I wanted to it to be very surreal, also the way it was edited.
Alberto loved to make films that challenged the status quo...
But they would be supported, or broken up, with these visions...
Of a dreamlike, imaginary, world.
You can see this in Spell.
Spell is the story of a provincial town...
With all its graces and
 all its defects.
Many of them.
Where this conformity sometimes comes out into the light.
And underneath that, also in the apparently more upright families...
More positive...
But they aren't, really.
Being with you has made me forget how to dream...
Only nightmares.
You've driven me insane.
Don't come any closer.
You stink like a pig.
You're disgusting.
Disgusting!
Don't move.
And listen to me.
In some scenes, the relationship between the husband and wife...
He certainly drew from his own experience...
From our relationship.
I think it was perfectly normal...
To draw from something you know very well.
And then to amplify it, modify it...
There are certainly some elements of our private life in there.
I played the role of a wife who appears to be content...
But she's very unsatisfied.
Unfulfilled.
And there are a couple of scenes that left an impression on me...
That I performed in.
One is an argument over dinner...
An argument with my husband.
Before the meal,
I'm cleaning a chicken...
I'm cutting it, and while we're arguing...
I feel this kind of exultation.
And I cut this chicken...
In what must be for the spectator, quite a cruel fashion.
As though I were cutting up my husband while I'm arguing!
Then, after a lot of talking, it all ends with plates flying everywhere...
Scenes of hysterics and so on.
But then there also love scenes, peaceful moments...
Poetic scenes.
There's always been this alternation, in all of Alberto's films...
Of tranquillity, serenity, and hardship and violence.
Just like real life.
Did you enjoy the party?
I did but it's not enough...
I want to enjoy myself now as well.
Come here, let's do those dirty things I like!
I don't want to.
-You like it too!
I want to fuck you.
Let go of me.
Scoundrel.
Stop treating me like an animal.
We were very good friends with Martial...
He was a very sweet person.
He took his work very seriously.
A real professional.
Martial Boschero was a wonderful person, like all French people...
Like they are.
They're very...
It's hard to define a
French person...
Some people don't like the
French, Italians hate them...
But I've had a lot of dealings with them.
They're very affable people, like us Italians...
They think like we do, if you meet a French person...
And Martial Boschero really was a wonderful person...
And very intelligent.
He was very close to his sister, they had a great relationship...
That's Dominique Boschero.
He would be very concerned when people talked about him...
Because they all referred to him as
Dominique Boschero's brother.
But he had his own very well defined personality.
He was also an excellent dubbing artist...
He had dubbed films in France, dubbing them in Italian and vice-versa.
At the end of his career he'd set up a dubbing school...
Alberto and Martial collaborated artistically and remained good friends.
One of the female cast members who I enjoyed working with...
Even if we didn't get the chance to talk very often...
Was Macha Magall.
Of the other women, no.
Because Monika Zanchi...
...was always doing her own thing.
And because we were filming in a village she had many admirers.
Some chic, and some not so chic.
Josiane Tanzilli was quite a lively character...
So it was very easy to communicate with her.
She also had quite a lively boyfriend.
She was a nice person.
A little eccentric...
However...
Yes, I think Spell was the first film
I worked on with Alberto.
Yes, that's the one.
He let me act in it.
I had this small role.
I was a police inspector...
Who's an accomplice to a murder in a pool hall...
There's a dead woman there...
The scene I think everyone remembers most in Spell...
Is the scene in the pool hall with Monika Zanchi.
She's lying on a pool table...
And there's this imaginative scene with this very beautiful girl.
The spectators watching this scene in this bar...
Obviously, they were all a bit surprised.
But it was a great scene.
I didn't watch them film the final scene with Paola Montenero...
But I was quite shocked when
I saw that scene in the film.
It wasn't easy to do it.
He convinced everyone.
Slowly, you'd listen to him...
Convinced.
That's what he wanted.
He was very convincing.
Like always, whatever Alberto did, even if you didn't agree...
You'd end up agreeing with him.
He'd always find a way to persuade you.
He was very good at getting you to do what he wanted.
I remember Montenero didn't want to do this scene at first.
However in the end she did it.
I must force myself to do it to stop myself going crazy.
To not become an animal.
A thing.
I didn't want to do that scene in bed...
This is always around that scene when I'm reading the newspaper.
Because I had been asked to do a scene more daring than I was used to.
So I didn't want to do it.
But in the end he convinced me, and I did it.
But that scene got me into a lot of trouble.
With my education at the time.
Perhaps now, after many years,
I wouldn't be so shocked now.
But at the time I felt very uncomfortable doing that scene.
I felt so uncomfortable doing it at Alberto's request...
And it was a scene with a friend.
That was Martial, obviously.
It upset me so much that I didn't make any more films...
And I concentrated on painting, writing and sculpture.
I found a silver bracelet, it was near my side of the bed...
Perhaps you know about it?
But it doesn't matter...
He got his bracelet, and you cheated on me..
You're wrong!
-You slept with him.
I betrayed you, but I did it alone.
Our relationship on the set was very pleasant...
Even if, on some occasions...
I didn't feel a hundred percent free to say no or to challenge anything.
Yes, you could but you couldn't tell him in front of someone else...
It was always in private.
But it's right. It seems normal to me, he's the author.
Another person can't tell him to do it differently, it's ridiculous.
He didn't accept any criticism.
It was either yes or no.
Sometimes I did.
But I was always afraid...
...of putting Alberto in a bad light with the rest of the crew.
Because, if I wasn't his wife,
I would've behaved differently...
A scene I didn't like, or I could see differently...
I would've been quite blunt with him, without any hesitation.
But in this case I felt conditioned by the fact that I was his wife...
So I could tell him things and he would accept them.
I mean he would've accepted them.
But that could have made him uncomfortable with the other actors...
...or the crew.
In fact, it was more the other actors who would challenge him...
About things they didn't agree with, with Alberto, than me.
And between Alberto and me there was also this understanding...
That in any case, knowing me very well...
I would've said, yes, I agree.
Even if I didn't agree.
Whoever sells more tickets gets more holy cards...
And whoever has more holy cards
 wins a marvellous prize.
I think Alberto had a hard life.
He was unlucky, very unlucky.
I'd say a part of it was his own doing.
Because his breakthrough came with this film I've been told about...
...'Le Salamandre'.
An explosive film...
That made Alberto's name as a director.
They asked him to make the same film...
Knowing it would attract more interest...
But he didn't want to make the same film again.
I think it was one of
Alberto's biggest mistakes...
All he had to do was make the same film again with more famous actors...
And that would've made him.
Like all the famous directors.
Alberto had all the qualities to
 become a famous director.
I don't know, perhaps coming from his ex-wife this might seem exaggerated...
And I don't know if I'd call him a genius...
But he was a very prepared person, and very good at his job...
Absolutely at the avant-garde of the times, that's for sure.
Someone who challenged everything he didn't think was right for the country.
He would never have accepted any distribution deals...
If he had to cut any scenes for political reasons...
Or to cut, I don't know...
To take out a Christ or to put one in.
Because he wouldn't compromise about certain things...
Absolutely.
And, in any case, he was a great director.

this extremity of the skies.
Is man no more than this?
Consider him well.
Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool...
(Sniffs) The cat no perfume.
There's three of us are sophisticated!
Thou art the... thing itself!
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked... animal as thou art.
Off, off, you lendings!
Unbutton here.
Prithee, nuncle, be contented!
'Tis a naughty night to swim in!
Look! There comes a fire walking.
Who's there?
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet.
Aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
- What is't you seek?
- What are you there? Your names?
(Edgar) Poor Tom, who eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water.
What, hath your grace no better company?
The prince of darkness is a gentleman.
Modo he's called, and Mahu.
Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile that it doth hate what gets it.
(Edgar) Poor Tom's a-cold.
Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer to obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
Though their injunction be to bar my doors, yet have I ventured to come and seek you out, and bring you where both fire and food is ready.
First let me speak a word with this philosopher.
What is the cause... of thunder?
Good my lord, take his offer, go into the house.
I'll speak a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?
How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
Let me ask you one word... in private.
His wits begin to unsettle.
Canst thou blame him?
His daughters seek his death.
I tell you, friend,
I am almost mad myself.
I had a son, now outlawed from my blood.
He sought my life, but lately, very late.
I loved him, friend, no father his son dearer.
True to tell thee, the grief hath crazed my wits.
What a night's this!
I do beseech your grace!
(Lear) I cry you mercy, sir.
Good philosopher, your company.
(Edgar) Tom's a-cold.
In, fellow, there, into the hovel.
Keep thee warm.
- Come, let's in all.
- This way, my lord.
With him!
I will keep still with my philosopher.
- Good my lord, soothe him.
- Take him you on.
Sirrah, come on. Go along with us.
Come, good Athenian.
No words, no words! Hush!
Child Rowland to the dark tower came.
His word was still "Fie, foh, fum,
I smell the blood of a British man."
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
This is the paper he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France.
O heavens! That this treason were not, or not I the detector!
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.
True or false, it hath made thee
Earl of Gloucester.
Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension.
I will persever in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.
I will lay trust upon thee.
Thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.
Here is better than the open air.
Take it thankfully.
Frateretto calls me, and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can.
- I will not be long from you.
- The gods reward your kindness!
Prithee, nuncle... prithee.
Tell me whether a madman be a yeoman or a gentleman?
- A king, a king!
- (Kent) Shh!
No! He's a yeoman with a gentleman to his son.
To have a thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon 'em!
It shall be done.
I will arraign them straight.
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.
Thou, sapient sir, sit there.
- Now, you she-foxes!
- Look, where she stands and glares!
Want'st thou eyes at trial, madam?
# Come o'er the burn
Bessy come, to me
(Fool) # Come o'er the burn
Bessy, to me #
- (Lear screams)
- (Kent) Shh!
(Fool) # And she must not speak
# Why she dare not come over burn to thee #
Hoppendance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring.
Croak not, black angel!
I have no food for thee.
- How do you, sir?
- Stand you not so amazed.
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
I'll see their trial first.
You are o' the commission.
Sit you too.
Let us deal justly.
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
- Pur, the cat is grey.
- Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril!
I here take my oath before this honourable assembly.
She kicked the poor King her father.
Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
She cannot deny it.
Cry you mercy. I took you for a joint-stool.
Here's another, whose warped looks proclaim what stone her heart is made of.
Stop her! There!
Sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
Thou false justicer, why didst thou let her escape?
(Edgar) Bless thy five wits!
O pity! Sir, where is the patience now that thou so oft have boasted to retain?
The little dogs and all?
Tray, Blanch, and Sweet-heart?
- See, they bark at me.
- Tom will throw his head at them.
Avaunt, you curs!
Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
Then anatomize Regan, see what breeds about her heart.
Is there any cause in nature that makes these... hard... hearts?
You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred.
I do not like the fashion of your garments.
You will say they are Persian attire, but let them be changed.
Now, good my lord, lie down and rest awhile.
Make no noise.
Make no noise.
Will you draw the curtains?
So...
So.
I'll go to supper in the morning.
And I'll go to bed at noon.
- Where is the King my master?
- Here, sir.
Good friend, I prithee, take him in your arms.
Trouble him not. His wits are gone.
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.
There is a litter ready.
Lay him in't and drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.
Oppressed nature sleeps.
This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews, which, if convenience will not allow, stand in hard cure.
Come, come! Help to bear thy master.
Thou must not stay behind.
Who alone suffers, suffers most i' the mind.
How light and portable my pain seems now, when that which makes me bend makes the King bow.
What more will hap tonight, safe 'scape the King?
Lurk, lurk.
Come! Come away.
Agh!
This is a brave night to cool a courtesan.
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go.
When priests are more in word than matter, when brewers mar their malt with water, when nobles are their tailors' tutors, no heretics burned, but wenches' suitors, then shall the realm of Albion come to great confusion.
When every case in law is right, no squire in debt nor no poor knight, when usurers share their gold i' the field, and bawds and whores do churches build, then comes the time, who lives to see't, that going shall be used with feet...
Agh!
The army of France has landed.
How now, where's the King?
My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence.
Some five or six and thirty of his knights are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast to have well-armed friends.
Where is that traitor Gloucester?
Pinion him like a thief!
(Regan) Hang him instantly!
Post speedily to my lord your husband.
Show him this letter.
Edmund, keep you our sister company.
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.
Farewell, dear sister.
Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.
- Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
- (Cornwall) Get horses for your mistress.
Edmund, farewell.
- (Shouting)
- (Cornwall) Who's there? The traitor!
Ingrateful fox!
- (Regan) 'Tis he!
- Bind fast his corky arms.
What means your graces?
Good my friends, consider...
- Bind him, I say.
- (Regan) Hard.
Hard!
O filthy traitor!
Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.
To this chair bind him.
(Cornwall) Villain, thou shalt find.
By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done to pluck me by the beard.
So white... and such a traitor!
Naughty lady, these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin will quicken, and accuse thee.
- What will you do?
- Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
Be simple answered, for we know the truth.
And what confederacy have you with the traitors late footed in the kingdom?
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King? Speak!
I have a letter guessingly set down, that came from one that's of a neutral heart, not from one opposed.
Cunning.
And false.
- Where hast thou sent the King?
- To Dover.
Wherefore to Dover?
Wast thou not charged at peril?
- Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.
- I am tied to the stake. I must stand the...
Wherefore to Dover?
Because I would not see thy cruel nails pluck out his dear old eyes, nor thy fierce sister in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
But I shall see the winged vengeance o'ertake such children.
See't shalt thou never.
Fellows, hold the chair.
Upon these eyes of thine
I'll set my foot.
- One side will mock another, the other too.
- (Cornwall) If you see Vengeance...
No! Hold your hand, my lord!
I have served you ever since I was a child, but better service have I never done you than now to bid you hold.
How now, you dog!
If you did wear a beard upon your chin
I would shake it on this quarrel.
- What do you mean?
- My villain!
Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
A peasant stand up thus!
My lord, you have one eye left to see some mischief...
Lest it see more, prevent it.
Out, vile jelly!
- Where is thy lustre now?
- All dark and comfortless.
Where is my son Edmund?
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature to quit this horrid act.
Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call'st on him that hates thee.
It was he that made the overture of thy treasons to us, who is too good to pity thee.
O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell his way to Dover.
- How is't, my lord? My lord, how look you?
- I have received a wound.
Turn out that eyeless villain!
Throw that slave on the dunghill!
I bleed apace.
Untimely comes this hurt.
Give me your arm.
Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam to lead him where he would.
Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face.
Now, heaven, help him!
The lamentable change is from the best.
The worst returns to laughter.
- But who comes here?
- O, my good lord, we have been your tenants and your father's tenants these fourscore years.
Away! Get thee away! Good friend, be gone.
Thy comfort can do me no good at all.
Thee they may hurt.
You cannot see your way.
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes.
I stumbled when I saw.
O dear son Edgar, might I but live to see thee in my touch,
I'd say I had eyes again.
World, world, oh, world!
That thy strange mutations make us hate thee, life would not yield to age!
(Woman) How now? Who's there?
'Tis poor mad Tom.
Fellow, where goest?
- Is it the beggar-man?
- Ay, madman and beggar too.
He has some reason, else he could not beg.
In the last night's storm I such a fellow saw which made me think a man a worm.
My son came then into my mind.
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
They kill us for their sport.
- Bless thee, master!
- Is that the naked fellow?
- Ay, my lord.
- Then, prithee get thee away.
If for my sake thou shouldst o'ertake us hence a mile or twain on the road toward Dover, do it for ancient love, and bring some covering for this naked soul, who I'll entreat to lead me.
Alack, sir, he is mad.
'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have.
Come on't what will.
Oh! Sirrah!
- Naked fellow!
- Poor Tom's a-cold.
Bless thy sweet eyes... they bleed.
Knowest thou the way to Dover?
Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path.
- Here...
- So bless thee, master!
Here, take this purse. That I am wretched makes thee the happier.
Heavens, deal so still!
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man that slaves your ordinance, that will not see because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly!
So distribution should undo excess and each man have enough.
- Dost thou know Dover?
- Ay, master.
There is a cliff whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confined deep.
Bring me but to the very brim of it.
From that place
I shall no leading need.
Give me thy arm.
Poor Tom shall lead thee.
Oh!
Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: as Obidicut, Hobbididence, Mahu, Modo...
Welcome, my lord.
I marvel our mild husband not met us on the way.
- Now, where's your master?
- Madam, within, but never man so changed.
I told him of the army that was landed.
He smiled at it. I told him you were coming.
His answer was, "'The worse."
Of Gloucester's treachery, and of the loyal service of his son, when I informed him, then he called me sot and told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.
Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit that dares not undertake.
He'll not feel wrongs which tie him to an answer.
Our wishes on the way may prove effects.
Back, Edmund, to my brother.
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.
This trusty servant shall pass between us.
Ere long you are like to hear, if you dare venture in your own behalf, a mistress' command.
Wear this. Spare speech.
Decline your head.
This kiss, if it durst speak, would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
- Conceive, and fare thee well.
- Yours in the ranks of death.
My most dear Gloucester!
O, the difference of man and a man!
To thee a woman's services are due.
A fool usurps my body.
- Madam, here comes my lord.
- I have been worth the whistling.
O Goneril, you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face.
- I fear your disposition.
- No more. The text is foolish.
What have you done? Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?
A father, and a gracious aged man, most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits send quickly down to tame these vile offences, it will come.
Humanity must perforce prey on itself like monsters of the deep.
Milk-livered man, that bears a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs!
Where's thy drum? France spreads his banners in our noiseless land, whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries,
"Alack, why does he so?"
(Albany) See thyself, devil!
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend so horrid as in woman.
- O vain fool!
- Thou changed, self-covered thing!
Were't my fitness to let these hands obey my blood, they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones.
(Screams) Marry, thy manhood! Mew!
- What news?
- My good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead, slain by his servant, going to put out the other eye of Gloucester.
- Gloucester's eyes?
- A servant that he bred, bending his sword to his great master who, thereat enraged, flew on him, and amongst us felled him dead, but not without that harmful stroke, which since hath plucked him after.
This shows you are above, you justicers, that these our nether crimes so speedily can venge!
But... O poor Gloucester!
Lost he his other eye?
Both, both, my lord.
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.
'Tis from your sister.
One way I like this well.
But being widowed, and my Gloucester with her, may all the building in my fancy pluck upon my hateful life.
Another way, the news is not so tart.
I'll read, and answer.
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
- Come with thy lady hither.
- He is not here.
- No, my good lord. I met him back again.
- Knows he the wickedness?
Ay, my good lord.
'Twas he informed against him, and quit the house on purpose, that their punishment might have the freer course.
Come hither, friend.
Tell me what more thou know'st.
Alack... 'tis he!
Why, he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, with hardokes, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn.
What can man's wisdom in the restoring his bereaved sense?
There is means, madam. Our foster-nurse of nature is repose, the which he lacks.
A century send forth.
Search every acre of the high-grown field, and bring him to our eye.
- (Regan) But are my brother's powers set forth?
- Ay, madam.
- Himself in person there?
- Madam, with much ado.
Your sister is the better soldier.
- Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
- No, madam.
What might import my sister's letter to him?
- I know not, lady.
- Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out, to let him live.
Where he arrives he moves all hearts against us.
Edmund, I think, is gone, in pity of his misery, to dispatch his nighted life.
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you transport her purposes by word?
Belike some things, I know not what.
I'll love thee...
- Much... Let me unseal the letter.
- Madam, I had rather...
I know your lady does not love her husband.
I am sure of that.
I know you are of her bosom.
- I, madam?
- I speak in understanding.
Y'are, I know't.
Therefore I do advise you, take this note.
My lord is dead.
Edmund and I have... talked, and more convenient is he for my hand than for your lady's.
And so, fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
Would I could meet him, madam!
- I should show what party I do follow.
- (Regan) Fare thee well.
When shall I come to the top of that same hill?
You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
- Methinks the ground is even.
- Horrible steep.
- Hark, do you hear the sea?
- No, truly.
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes' anguish.
- So may it be, indeed.
- Come on, sir.
Here's the place.
Stand still.
How fearful and dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air show scarce so gross as beetles.
Half way down hangs... one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach, appear like mice.
And yon tall anchoring bark, diminished to her cock, her cock, a buoy almost too small for sight.
The murmuring surge, that on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes, cannot be heard so high.
(Gloucester) Set me where you stand.
Give me your hand.
- Ha...
- Oh!
You are now within a foot of the extreme verge.
Here, my friend, is a jewel well worth a poor man's taking.
Go thou farther off. Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going.
- Now fare ye well, good sir.
- With all my heart.
Why I do trifle thus with his despair is done to cure it.
O you mighty gods!
This world I do renounce, and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off.
If I could bear it longer and not fall to quarrel with thy great opposeless wills, my snuff and loathed part of nature should burn itself out.
If Edgar live, O bless him!
Now, fellow, fare thee well.
Gone, sir. Farewell.
Ho, you sir! Friend! Hear you, sir?
Speak!
Ah! Yet he revives.
- What are you, sir?
- Away, and let me die.
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, so many fathoms down precipitating, thou'dst shivered like an egg.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
Thy life's a miracle.
- Speak yet again.
- Yet have I fallen or no?
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
- Do but look up.
- Alack, I have no eyes.
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit, to end itself by death?
Up. So. How is 't?
Feel you your legs?
You stand.
- Too well, too well.
- This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that which parted from you?
- A poor unfortunate beggar.
- As I stood here below, methought his eyes were two full moons.
He had a thousand noses, horns welked and waved like the enridged sea.
It was some fiend.
Therefore, thou happy father, think that the clearest gods, who make them honours of men's impossibilities, have here preserved thee.
I do remember now.
Henceforth I'll bear affliction till it do cry out itself,
"Enough, enough," and die.
They cannot touch me for coining.
I am the King himself.
Nature's above art in that respect.
There's your press money.
That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper.
Draw me a clothier's yard!
No... no... A mouse!
Peace... peace.
This piece of toasted cheese will do 't.
There's my gauntlet.
Ah!
I'll prove it on a giant.
O, well flown, bird!
In the clout, in the clout!
- Hewgh! Give the word.
- Sweet marjoram?
- Pass.
- (Gloucester) I know that voice.
Goneril, with a white beard!
Oh! They flattered me like a dog.
To say "ay" and "no" to every thing I said!
When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, and the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt them out.
Go to, they are not men of their words.
They told me I was everything.
'Tis a lie.
I am not ague-proof. (Laughs)
The trick of that voice
I well remember. Is 't not the King?
Ay, every inch a king.
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man's life.
What was thy cause? Adultery?
Thou shalt not die.
Die for adultery? No.
The wren goes to 't, the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father than my daughters got between the lawful sheets.
To 't, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers.
Behold yond simpering dame... that minces virtue, shakes the head to hear of pleasure's name.
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse goes to't with a more riotous appetite.
But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath... is all the fiends'.
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit, there's burning, scalding... consummation!
Fie, fie, fie!
Pah... Pah!
Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary.
Sweeten my imagination.
There's money for ye.
- O, let me kiss that hand!
- Let me wipe it first.
(Sniffs) It smells of mortality.
O ruined piece of nature!
This great world will so wear out to naught.
- Dost thou know me?
- I remember thine eyes well enough.
Dost thou squiny at me? Read thou this challenge you. Mark but the penning of it.
Were all the letters suns, I could not see.
- Read.
- What, with the case of eyes?
O, ho, are you there with me now? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse?
Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light.
- Yet you see how this world goes.
- I see it feelingly.
What, art mad?
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.
Look with your ears, see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief.
Hark, in thine ear.
Change places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?
Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
- Ay, sir.
- And the creature run from the cur?
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority, a dog's obeyed in office.
Through tattered clothes small vices do appear.
Robes and furred gowns hide all.
None does offend.
None, I said, none!
Take that of me, my friend, that have the power to seal the accusers' lips.
- Get thee glass eyes.
- Oh!
And like a scurvy politician seem to see the things thou dost not.
- (Sobs)
- Now, now! Now, now!
Pull off my boots.
Harder, harder! So.
I know thee well enough.
Thy name is Gloucester.
Thou must be patient.
We came crying hither.
Thou knowest the first time we smell the air, we wawl and cry.
I will preach to thee. Mark!
Alack, alack the day!
When we are born... we cry... that we are come to this great stage of fools.
This is a good block.
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof.
(Whispers) When I have stolen upon these sons-in-laws, then...
(Shrieks) Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!
- Kill!
- Ah, here he is. Lay hand upon him.
Sir, your most dear daughter...
No rescue? Am I a prisoner?
Use me well. You shall have ransom.
Let me have surgeons.
I am cut to the brains.
- You shall have any thing.
- No seconds? All myself?
I will die bravely.
Like a smug bridegroom.
I will be jovial.
I am a king, my masters, know you that?
You are a royal one.
We obey you.
Then there's life in't.
And you get it, you shall get it by running!
- Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
- Most sure and certain.
But, by your favour, how near's the other army?
- Near and on speedy foot.
- I thank you, sir. That's all.
You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me.
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please!
Well pray you, father.
I'll lead you to some biding.
Oh, hearty thanks!
The bounty and the benison of heaven!
A proclaimed prize!
Most happy!
Thou old, unhappy traitor, briefly thyself remember.
The weapon is out that must destroy thee.
Now let thy friendly hand put strength enough to't.
(Oswald) Wherefore, bold peasant, darest thou support a published traitor?
- Away! Let go his arm.
- 'Chill not let go without further 'cagion.
Let go, slave... or thou diest!
Nay! You come not near the old man.
Keep out, che vor ye, or I 'ce try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder.
- 'Chill be plain with you.
- Out, dunghill!
'Chill pick your teeth, sir, no matter for your foins!
Slave, thou hast slain me.
Villain...
Take my purse.
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body and give the letters which thou find'st about me to Edmund, Earl of Gloucester.
O, untimely death! Death...
- A serviceable villain.
- What, is he dead?
He's dead. I am only sorry he had no other deathsman.
Let us see.
"Edmund,
"Let our reciprocal vows be remembered.
You have many opportunities to cut him off.
"There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner,
"and his bed my gaol,
"from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me and supply the place for your labour.
"Your wife, so I would say, Goneril."
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life... and the exchange... my brother!
The King is mad.
How stiff is my vile sense that I stand up and have ingenious feelings of my huge sorrows!
Better I were distract.
So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs.
Give me thy hand.
Come, father.
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work to match thy goodness?
My life will be too short and every measure fail me.
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'er-paid.
- These weeds are memories of worser hours.
- Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
My boon I make it, that you know me not till time and I think meet.
Then be't so, my good lord.
So please your majesty, that we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed.
Is he array'd?
Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep we put fresh garments on him.
(Doctor) Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
Please you, draw near.
Come the music there!
O my dear father!
Let this kiss repair those violent harms that my two sisters have in thy reverence made!
(Kent) Kind and dear princess!
Had you not been their father, these white flakes did challenge pity of them.
Was this a face to be opposed against the jarring winds?
Mine enemy's dog, though he hath bit me, should have stood that night against my fire.
He wakes! Speak to him.
Madam, do you. 'Tis fittest.
How does my royal lord?
How fares your majesty?
You do me wrong to take me out o'the grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears do scald like molten lead.
- Sir...
- Hmm?
Do you know me?
You are a spirit, I know.
Where did you die?
- Still, still far wide!
- He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
Where have I been? Where am I?
Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused.
I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands.
Let's see.
I felt that pin-prick.
I would I were assured of my condition.
O look upon me, sir, and raise your hands in benediction o'er me.
No, sir, you must not kneel.
I pray you, do not mock me.
I am a very foolish, fond old man, fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less, and, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man, but I am doubtful, and I am mainly ignorant of what place this is.
And all the skill I have remembers not these garments.
Do not laugh at me, for, as I am a man,
I think this lady to be my child Cordelia.
And so I am, I am.
Be your tears wet? Yes, faith!
I pray you, weep not.
I know you do not love me, for your sisters have, as I remember, done me wrong.
You have some cause. They have none.
No cause, no cause.
- Am I in France?
- In your own kingdom, sir.
- Do not abuse me.
- Be comforted, good madam.
The great rage, you see, is killed in him.
Desire him to go in.
Will't please your highness walk?
You must bear with me.
I pray you now, forget... and forgive.
I am old and foolish.
'Tis time to look about. The powers of the kingdom approach apace.
The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
Fare you well, sir.
My point and period will be throughly wrought, or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold?
He's full of alteration and self-reproving.
Bring his constant pleasure.
- Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
- 'Tis to be doubted, madam.
Now... sweet lord, you know the goodness I intend upon you.
Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth.
- Do you not love my sister?
- In honoured love.
But have you never found my brother's way to the forfended place?
That thought abuses you.
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct and bosomed with her, as far as we call hers.
No, by mine honour, madam.
I never shall endure her.
Dear my lord... be not familiar with her.
Fear not.
I had rather lose the battle than that sister should loosen him and me.
Our very loving sister, well be-met.
Sir.
This I heard.
The King is come to his daughter, with others whom the rigour of our state forced to cry out.
Where I could not be honest,
I never yet was valiant.
For this business, it touches us as France invades our land, not bolds the King, with others, whom, I fear, most just and heavy causes make oppose.
Sir, you speak nobly.
- Why is this reasoned?
- Combine together 'gainst the enemy.
For these domestic and particular broils are not the question here.
Let's then determine with the ancient of war on our proceeding.
I shall attend you presently at your tent.
Sister, you'll go with us.
No.
'Tis most convenient. Pray go with us.
(Whispers) I know the riddle.
I will go.
If e'er your grace had speech with one so poor, hear me one word.
I'll overtake you. Speak.
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound for him that brought it.
Wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove what is avouched here.
- Fortune love you.
- Stay till I have read the letter.
I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry and I'll appear again.
Why, fare you well.
I will o'erlook thy paper.
- Your haste is urged upon you.
- We will greet the time.
To both these sisters have I sworn my love, each jealous of the other, as the stung are of the adder.
Which of them shall I take?
Both?
One?
Or neither?
Neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive.
Now, we'll use his countenance for the battle, which being done, let her who would be rid of him devise his speedy taking off.
As for the mercy which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia, the battle done and they within our power, shall never see his pardon.
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree for your good host.
If ever I return, I will bring you comfort.
Grace go with you, sir!
Pray that the right may thrive.
Away, old man!
Give me thy hand. Away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
- Give me thy hand. Come on.
- No farther, sir. A man may rot even here.
What, in ill thoughts again?
Men must endure their going hence... even as their coming hither.
Ripeness is all.
Give me thy hand, come on!
That's true too.
Good guard, until their greater pleasures first be known that are to censure them.
We are not the first who with best meaning, have incurred the worst.
For thee, oppressed King,
I am cast down.
Myself could else out-frown false Fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
No, no, no, no!
Come, let's away to prison.
We two alone shall sing like birds i' the cage.
And when you ask me blessing
I'll kneel down and ask of you forgiveness.
And so we'll live, and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too.
Who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out, and take upon us the mystery of things as if we were God's spies.
(Edmund) Take them away.
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, the gods themselves throw incense.
Have I caught thee?
He that parts us, bring a brand from heaven and fire us hence like foxes.
Wipe thine eyes.
Come.
Come hither, captain.
Hark. Take thou this note.
Go follow them to the prison.
One step have I advanced thee.
If thou dost as this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes.
To be tender-minded does not become a sword.
I'll do't, my lord.
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.
If it be man's work, I'll do't.
Sir, you have shown today your valiant strain, and Fortune led you well.
You have the captives who were the opposites of this day's strife.
I do require them of you.
I thought it fit to send the old and miserable King to some retention and appointed guard.
With him I sent the Queen and they are ready tomorrow or at further space to appear where you shall hold your session.
Sir, by your patience,
I hold you but a subject of this war, not as a brother.
That's as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded ere you had spoke so far.
He led our powers, bore the commission of my place and person, the which immediacy may well stand up and call itself your brother.
(Goneril) Not so hot!
In his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition.
In my rights, by me invested, he compeers the best.
That were the most were he to husband you.
Jesters do oft prove prophets.
Holla, holla! That eye that told you so looked but asquint.
Lady...
I am not well, else I should answer from a full-flowing stomach.
General, take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.
Dispose of them, of me. The walls are thine.
Witness the world that I create thee here my lord and master.
- Mean you to enjoy him?
- The let-alone lies not in your good will.
- Nor in thine, lord.
- Half-blooded fellow, yes.
Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
Stay yet, hear reason.
Edmund, I arrest thee on capital treason, and, in thine attaint, this gilded serpent.
For your claim, fair sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife.
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord.
If you will marry, make your loves to me.
My lady is bespoke.
(Scoffs) An interlude!
(Albany) Thou art arm'd, Gloucester.
Let the trumpet sound.
If none appear to prove upon thy person thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
I will myself approve it.
- Sick...
- If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
What in the world he is that names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
Call by the trumpet. He that dares approach, on you, on him? Who not?
- I will maintain my truth and honour firmly.
- (Albany) A herald!
- My sickness grows upon me.
- She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
Come hither, herald.
Let the trumpet sound, and read out this.
"If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army
"will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,
"that he is a manifold traitor,
"let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet."
Again!
Again!
Ask him his purposes, why he appears upon this call o' the trumpet.
What are you?
Your name, your quality, and why you answer this present summons?
Know, my name is lost, by treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.
Which is that adversary?
What's he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?
Himself. What sayest thou to him?
Thou art a traitor... false to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father.
Say thou "no", thou liest.
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head.
This sword of mine shall give them instant way where they shall rest for ever.
Trumpets, speak!
(Goneril shrieks) No!
This is practise, Gloucester.
By the laws of war thou wast not bound to answer an unknown opposite.
Thou art not vanquished, but cozen'd and beguiled.
Thou, worse than any name, read thine own evil.
No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.
What, if I do? The laws are mine, not thine.
Who can arraign me for't?
Most monstrous! O!
Knowest thou this paper?
Ask me not what I know.
After her. She's desperate. Govern her.
What you have charged me with, that have I done, and more, much more.
The time will bring it out.
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou?
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.
My name is Edgar... and thy father's son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us.
'Tis true.
The wheel has come full circle.
I am here.
Where have you hid yourself? How have you known the miseries of your father?
By nursing them, my lord.
List a brief tale.
The bloody proclamation to escape that followed me so near taught me to shift into a madman's rags, and in this habit met I my father with his bleeding rings, their precious stones new lost.
I became his guide, led him, begged for him, saved him from despair.
Never... O fault!
...revealed myself unto him until some half-hour past, when I was armed.
I asked his blessing, and first to last told him my pilgrimage, but his flawed heart, alack, too weak the conflict to support,
'twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, burst... smilingly.
This tale of yours hath moved me, and shall perchance do good.
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man, who once had seen me in my worst estate, and finding who it was who so endured, fastened on my neck and bellowed out as he'd burst heaven, threw him on my father, told the most piteous tale of Lear and him that ever ear received.
- But who was this?
- Kent, sir, the banished Kent.
- (Curan) Help, help! O, help!
- What means that bloody knife?
'Tis hot, it smokes!
It came even from the heart of...
O, she's dead!
- Who dead? Speak, man.
- Your lady, sir, your lady!
And her sister by her is poisoned.
She confesses it.
I was contracted to them both.
All three now marry in an instant.
Here comes Kent.
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
Is this he?
I am come to bid my king and master aye good night. Is he not here?
Speak, Edmund. Where's the King and where's Cordelia?
See'st thou this object, Kent?
Alack, why thus?
Yet Edmund was beloved.
(Wheezing) I pant for life.
Some good I mean to do despite of mine own nature.
Quickly send!
Be brief in it, to the prison, for my writ is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
- Nay, send in time!
- Run, run! Go, run!
- Who has the office?
- Send thy token of reprieve.
Take my sword!
The captain, give it the captain.
The gods defend them.
(Lear) Howl!
Howl!
Howl!
(Weakly) Howl...
O, you are men of stone!
Had I your tongues and eyes,
I'd use them so that heaven's vault should crack.
She's gone for ever.
I know when one is dead, and when one lives.
She's dead as earth.
Lend me a looking-glass.
If that her breaths do mist or stain the stone, why, then she lives.
- Is this the promised end?
- Or image of that horror?
- Fall, and cease!
- This feather stirs, she lives!
If it be so, it is a chance that does redeem all sorrows that ever I have felt.
- O my good master!
- Prithee, away.
- 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
- A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have saved her.
Now she's gone for ever.
Cordelia...
Cordelia...
Stay a little...
What is't thou sayest?
Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.
- 'Tis true, my lords, he did.
- Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip.
I am old now and these same crosses spoil me.
Who are you? Mine eyes are not of the best,
I tell you straight.
If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated, one of them we behold.
This is a dull sight.
Are you not Kent?
The same, your servant Kent.
Where is your servant Caius?
Oh, he's a good fellow,
I tell you straight.
He'll strike, and quickly too.
He's dead and rotten.
- No, my good lord. I am the very man...
- I'll see that straight.
That, from your first of difference and decay have followed your sad steps.
- You are welcome hither.
- No man else.
All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, and desperately are dead.
Ay, so I think.
He knows not what he says, but vain it is that we present us to him.
(Edgar) Very bootless.
Edmund, my lord, is dead.
What comforts to this... great decay may come shall be applied.
For us we will resign, during the life of this old majesty, to him our absolute power.
All friends shall taste the wages of their virtue, and all foes the cup of their deservings.
See, see!
And my poor fool is hanged!
No... no... no life!
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life... and thou no breath at all?
Thou'lt come no more.
Never... never... never...
(Sobs) Never... never...
Pray you undo this button.
Thank you, sir.
Do you see this? Look on her.
Look, her lips!
Look there!
Look there...
- He faints! My lord, my lord!
- (Kent) Break, heart, I prithee, break!
- Look up, my lord.
- Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass.
He hates him that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer.
He is gone, indeed.
Friends of my soul, you twain rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
My master calls me, I must not say no.
The weight of this sad time... we must obey.
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most.
We that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.
LOVE AND ANARCHY
Mom, what's an anarchist?
Someone that kills kings and throws bombs.
Someone that ends up with a rope around his neck. Now shut up.
Socialism, that's what we need, not anarchy. Or one ends up executed.
We also need the executed!
As long as the world becomes one... for all of us, brothers and sisters, equal and free, like nature made us.
I'm back to kill Mussolini.
Love, love!
Giovinò's is closed.
This is a first-class joint, you know?
We open at 11:00, but there's nothing to do!
Bring me a lot of roses
A lot of them with many thorns
Take care of some rooms.
Hello?
Do you have a hearing problem?
We're closed!
We open at 11:00.
Don't think to insist!
Shit, you're really ugly.
Where in the hell did you come from?
Do you have any money?
You know, it's expensive here.
This is a first-class joint. Do you know how much a fuck costs? 7 lire.
You're scared? What happened?
It disappeared? Get electrocuted?
I'm here!
Odette, where's the clean laundry?
I've been looking for it for over an hour. What a mess!
They never find anything in here.
Oh, dear Saint Rosalie.
If you're in a hurry to fuck, why don't you go to Pellegrino's?
It's cheap there. Actually, why don't you give yourself a nice hand job?
You might get a kick out of it.
Actually, I'm looking for Miss Salomè.
Shit!
I'm a relative.
Where is he? Shit, Zoraide, you idiot!
Why did you wax the stairs?
Everyone is falling down.
Where is he? He's my cousin.
Well, you did grow up, cousin.
You became a hunk, baby.
It's about time you arrived.
Sorry, I can't kiss you with this stuff on my face.
Beauty mask.
Zoraide, isn't he handsome?
How is my aunt? Does she still have problems with varicose veins?
Come on up.
Let's get comfortable and talk.
Zoraide, can you tell Miss Aida
I'm busy this morning?
I have a relative visiting.
Come this way. It's faster.
My room is the mirror room, the best in the house. It's like a fairy tale.
Come on. Follow me.
Come on.
Look. What a beautiful house.
It's the most elegant house in Rome.
Hey, who's that stranger?
Shut up. He's a relative.
Carmela, the lieutenant of the house.
Hello.
Hello, my ass. What about this morning at 11:00? Who's gonna do it?
Let's not mess it up.
Shut up. I'll ask Ivonne.
My cousin has just arrived.
The cousin, the cousin.
He comes here to get it.
Wait. I need to ask a favor of a friend. Ivonne?
No kidding. She's snoring like a train. Ivonne!
Would you shut up, shit!
Oh, I'm sorry, milady, for my loud voice.
Sleep is sacred.
I'm sorry, okay? Introductions:
Miss Jacqueline, my cousin.
What do you want?
Can you take care of my morning shift?
My cousin is visiting.
Let me introduce you:
Ms. Ivonne, my cousin.
- Good morning!
- My pleasure.
Your cousin. So in the meantime,
I get stuck. You owe me.
What are you doing?
Tonino!
Come in. Get comfortable.
Ignore the mess.
Come on, leave him alone.
Look, breakfast is still on the bed.
Come on.
Make yourself at home.
I'm sorry I said you're my cousin, but this way they won't bother us.
Close the door. Those idiots are always walking up and down the hall.
So, you're Soffiantini alias Tonino, right? I'm Salomè!
Pleasure to meet you.
How was the trip? Good?
Come here.
Sit down.
Shit, those idiots haven't prepared my room yet.
I'm really sorry, but sit down.
Oh, sorry. Now, let's enjoy a cup of coffee, okay?
Odette. Two coffees, room nine, please. Quickly.
So the news is confirmed.
Wednesday, July 8th, it's sure!
Tomorrow we're going to the place.
By the way, those windows
I wrote to the guys about?
They are right over the square, just in case you prefer a rifle.
No. I practiced with a handgun.
I don't trust rifles.
Rumba, the longer you touch it, the longer it gets.
Rumba? Please, you don't know what Rumba is.
Leave me alone, whores!
Who do you think you are, huh?
I can get in trouble.
A perennial virgin!
If she's not fucking, she goes insane.
Yeah.
Who'd take her?
Shut up, you rude thing.
I'm not gonna bring you coffee, shame of our land, you whore.
Come in. Come in, Odette.
Finally, the coffee.
My mouth is like a toilet bowl if I don't drink coffee in the morning.
Have you seen Madam Aida?
No, but Donna Carmela has taken charge.
She's downstairs in the hall.
Do I have to tell her anything?
Don't wake up the sleeping dog!
But if she asks... tell her that I have guests and not to bother me.
What are you looking at?
He's my cousin. I'm almost his aunt.
Go. Go. These snoopy ones always think the worst.
And close the door, stupid!
How much sugar?
One or two?
Two, thank you.
So, I think we've said everything there is to say.
You know, the information should be accurate... because most of our clients are very important people.
Military officials.
All the good ones.
Filthy and vain men that like to talk about ceremonies.
You know, they would love to see us at their parades.
You can't imagine how filthy those pigs are.
Well, good luck.
For July 8th?
To July 8th.
Listen. Do you really come from Paris?
Don't tell me if it's a secret.
The less one knows about these things the better.
Well, let's hope we return safely.
I don't know why I'm doing this... because you're all crazy.
In my opinion, I can't stand... these people that are so intelligent yet create such a shitty world.
And you? Isn't it the same for you?
You're still so young... otherwise why would you be doing this?
I... I hate tyrants!
But you... Tell me, Tonino, you're not thinking about tyrants, are you?
You're looking at my legs.
- Oh, fuck. Come on.
- Come on, you're staring at my legs.
It's like you're starving in front of a rotisserie.
I can't keep watching those eyes.
I'm sorry, but have you ever been in a brothel?
Never! When I was serving in Cuneo there were girls under the bridge... but I've never been in a brothel.
Not even in Paris.
I was busy there.
Oh, well.
Why didn't you say something?
You stay there, quiet, quiet like a hungry kiddie.
Come on.
Given our plans, let's just do it.
I'm actually very happy to satisfy someone like you.
You never know, it might even bring me some luck.
Come on, come here.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Don't make a fuss about it!
Don't! If I don't like it, it's the same anyway.
No, I haven't found a place to stay yet.
Maybe later, if it's not too much trouble. Thank you.
Sure. We'll find some time, right?
But tell me, is it okay?
Thank you very much.
By the way, Pensione Margherita is right around the corner.
- I got you a room there.
- Thank you, very kind of you.
Via Manziana, it's the first one on the right after you leave.
If you need anything, don't hesitate.
Thank you.
Thanks for the thought.
Then, Tonino, when you get settled, you can come back to eat.
Thanks!
I'll be waiting for you. Bye.
- Well, maybe...
- What?
Well... Maybe I'll settle in later, unless I'd be an inconvenience?
Sure, I told you.
You need some satisfaction.
Especially here with all these beautiful girls. I know men.
This way it's over with, and you get your head back on track.
Exactly.
Thank you very much!
Come on, come here.
Anteo Zamboni. Ever heard of him?
The attack on Mussolini in Bologna.
You were there?
I was with Anteo.
But we were not involved in it.
Via Rizzoli.
Maybe 5:30 PM.
The procession with Mussolini's car was passing by. He was standing up... among all the black shirts.
Then suddenly a gun shot, loud.
I can still hear it. Then complete confusion. At that moment... the shooter, a guy in his thirties, came like a snake near us... and threw the gun at Anteo's feet shouting, "It's him, it's him!"
"Get him! Get the killer!"
Then he disappeared, that coward!
I'll remember it for the rest of my life. Anteo. Poor guy.
With that haircut and face. So young.
He looked like a baby, 15 years old.
He looked at me. So shocked he couldn't even call for help.
"It's not true!
I didn't shoot anybody! No!"
While those crazy bastards, bastards in black shirts... jumped on him like animals.
I was screaming. They pushed me away.
And that's it.
It was a slaughter.
So bad that at the police station,
Balbo threw up when he saw him!
And someone from Brescia passed out.
That's how bad he was.
And then they constructed a bunch of bullshit that served only to show... there are far more cops than citizens here. And then they literally... crushed the family, you know, really crushed them.
Why? What did they do?
Mammolo Zamboni, the father, and the sister Virginia Tabarroni... were ex-anarchists.
You can imagine.
Thirty years in jail.
Don't even know if they're still alive.
The mother died in a madhouse last year.
But it's better that way.
And me, I was like a fiancée.
And among all that shit, it was like I had leprosy.
So I left.
Oh, shit.
It was hell.
I changed my name, and here I am.
And here I am playing Salomè.
Here, yes, but to prepare everything for you! To prepare this nice July 8th.
You know, I promised myself and Anteo.
I promised those eyes crying for help.
I swore to him, "My love, someone will pay. That bastard has to die!"
Enough now with these stories.
It's useless to talk about it anyway.
Salomè... Oh, shit! I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, may I?
- No, he's my cousin.
- It's an honor.
I'm sorry, it's a pleasure.
I'm Tripolina.
Come on, give him more chicken.
The salad too.
Eat, Tonino, it's good for you.
A big boy like you, used to the country.
You know, I don't like to send a relative to the restaurant.
Madam Aida, thank you.
It was kind of you to invite him over for lunch.
Don't give him so much wine that he gets drunk, fuck!
I said thank you, Madam.
Oh, shit, Madam, this egg is not fresh.
What?
How boring.
My eggs come fresh every day from the country.
Fresh every day? A little chick is going to hatch any moment now!
What is she saying?
She said that a little chick is coming out any moment now.
Nice. Here you have that little chick.
In this house you eat very well.
Oh, sure!
In Florence at Madam Saffo's...
Ms. Valeria got a chef from Paris to please her girls.
A chef from Paris?
Who knows what's behind that?
What's the chef's name,
René, maybe?
Yes, do you know him?
Darling, René isn't there for cooking but for sleeping. Let me tell you.
Forget the kitchen, he's working in Valeria's bed.
She's making him earn the money.
She's not a fool.
In Turin at 13 via Fratelli Calandra, there you really eat like a king!
No, no, Tonino. This is the house where you eat the best.
You're the guest.
What do you think?
Actually... The food seems great, and there's plenty of it.
- Oh, sure. Like in the army!
- How nice, funny girl.
How finicky.
All princesses on a pea.
How ungrateful.
You know, boy... on Sunday I even send them to Faraglia for a sorbet.
You listen to Madam. This is better than Danieli's restaurant in Venice.
Don't make me remember Danieli's.
That was my realm, you know.
Yeah, when you used to wash dishes there, baby.
May you get cancer, fucking bitch!
You get something, idiot...
You know, Tonino, I'm not like them.
I'm an artist.
Do you know what they used to call me at the Salone Margherita?
They called me the Italian Josephine Baker.
Listen, she makes me laugh with that bullshit.
Shut up!
What do you know about my life?
When I had on my silver dress and my ostrich feathers... the royal princes started salivating.
I was a star, Mr. Tonino.
Oh, no. Don't tell me she's gonna start singing?
I still have my voice, you know.
Listen to me.
Idiots!
But since she got syphilis, she's gone insane, that girl.
You're stupid. What do you think?
That we can't sing? Listen now.
- Idiot!
- Stupid!
Fuck you, you know?
They're really shouting, aren't they?
They're giving me a headache.
Ivonne, for crying out loud, you're giving the Baroness a headache.
Baroness Fornigotti, the baroness of the broken asses.
Well, well! Stop it now!
What is this? Where are we?
Well, in a brothel, Madam.
No, baby.
This is not a brothel!
This is a classy house, a mansion.
Understand? Good! If you don't, take your stuff and get out of here!
She's right!
Go tell her.
I don't care, spy!
I'm gonna tell her right now.
Fuck you!
Tell her, come on.
You fucking bitch!
You eat. Don't pay attention to these bitches, eat.
That's where you copied your
Jean-Harlow-of-the-Renaissance haircut.
Stick it up your ass, bitch!
Coffee!
Beautiful, I like it a lot.
Now sing another one.
We have time anyway. Come on.
Don't be difficult, just play.
Miss Salomè, you have a phone call.
Come on, it must be our uncle.
You pig, shut up.
We're on the phone.
I don't know, darling.
Sunday is a time of rest, you know.
What? No, I said rest, stupid!
Listen, stop it. It's all right, as long as you promise to be a good boy.
But I have a cousin here with me.
Yes, poor guy.
He's from the country, and he looks like Alice in Wonderland.
I'm not gonna leave him alone in a whorehouse! I can't!
Well, okay, then I'll bring Tripolina,
Yes, it's okay then.
Shut up, you filthy thing.
Okay, bye-bye.
What can I say? He always brings me
French fragrances, nice!
Shit, I did it.
That was Spatoletti.
Do you know how lucky we are?
Tomorrow we'll go together.
- But who's this Spatoletti?
- Are you kidding?
He's the one that sets up the secret service... to protect Mussolini. I've been after him for three months, that pig.
That son of a bitch was part of the first squads, you know?
Listen. Do you think we're blankets?
Leaving us there under the sun?
There'll be so many people that we won't see shit!
And I'm pissed off because I wanted to see Mussolini.
Calm down, honey.
Spatoletti is here!
I'll find you a first-class spot.
No, I wanna stay close to you.
Or at least one of your secret agents.
You know, if they're secret, a lady nearby can be useful.
But will there be other secret agents?
Yes, 35 of them.
Imagine, 35, all right!
- That's too many!
- Security is all my responsibility!
As long as Spatoletti is there,
Italy can sleep tight.
Damn it, they just have to try, and I'll break them!
Watch out if they touch the Duce!
You're driving like a madman!
Let me out now!
Romoletto, what beautiful girls
I've brought you!
I'm so hungry.
Keep your hands off me. Let's eat.
Come on, sit down.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a cow.
So what's cooking, Romoletto?
Today: Matriciana pasta, eggs fettuccine, chicken.
Matriciana pasta? You've got everything,
Romoletto, good, good.
Who are they? Your daughters?
They're beautiful, nice and firm.
Fortunately, they weren't ready for use in 1922, otherwise...
The whole Tamburini squad, 2,000 of us.
We camped out here for the Rome march.
Do you remember, Romoletto?
Shit! Remember it! Since then they call me "Five and three-eight."
"Five and three-eight," right.
Who was it? Chiusini or Govoni?
We were hungry, you know? And drunk on castle wine. We weren't gentle.
He was late with the chicken. I remember he said, "You need to be patient."
And zap! A knife cut off two of his fingers.
Poor guy.
Did you hear that?
Come on, you must understand us Fascists. We were on the edge.
And that was the revolution, right?
We were making the Italy of Mussolini.
And Romoletto lost two fingers.
You have to feel honored.
It's like you have a medal that big!
Sure. I'm honored!
But there's a little political problem.
If I may, when I do the Roman greeting, they're like horns.
I wouldn't want Mussolini to be offended.
I'm so funny, aren't I?
Oh, fuck.
Did you hear that?
Romoletto?
Salomè, I'm going to jump you.
I will split you open.
You bitch, you do it on purpose because you like me, yes?
My little puppy, isn't it true that I make your mouth water?
Everyone knows that
I love macho men like you.
But then, you filthy villain, who can resist you?
Romoletto!
What are you screaming for, damn it?
Romoletto, hurry up!
I'll throw you in jail, damn it!
Tonino, listen. I'll keep him in the room for a couple of hours, okay?
You're going with that asshole now?
Stupid, he'll explain the ceremony in detail.
In the meantime, check out the square, all right?
- Blondie, are we going?
- Yes, calm down.
And if it's true that you have a soft spot for me, this time I want proof.
Yes, baby. Look.
Honey, if you really liked me, you could do it for free occasionally.
I promised. When my fiancé left me pregnant at 16, I promised.
Not even with the pope.
I'd rather close down business
The exception confirms the rule.
Come on.
No! I told you. Not even free for his sanctity, Pius XI.
Today it's Sunday.
The rate is 12 lire, so?
Bitch! Why won't you give that satisfaction?
- 12 lire or nothing. So?
- So, I'll give the 12 lire!
How generous, for 12 lire.
You could have done it once!
Sure!
With a Tuscany guy like you.
- For love.
- What love?
You cynic.
Enough! You've been destroying my buttocks since this morning.
You love me so much, I can feel it.
I'm gonna do you in the ass right now.
He finally did it. He gave me a headache with that voice. You too?
Yes, madam.
Madam? My name is Tripolina.
Right, Tripoli, land of love.
I was looking for an eccentric name.
Tripolina came out.
Maybe I've always liked Africa, the palms.
Rudolph Valentino doing "The Sheik."
How stupid!
Well, instead you could have called yourself Curly.
Yes.
The country is so beautiful, so green, with fresh air.
Beautiful.
It's very hot today. It's time to go swimming. Do you like the sea?
I've never seen it.
You've never seen the sea?
I've always lived in the country.
That's why you've got such a clean face.
You're a great dancer.
I get by.
What are looking at? Don't look at me like that. You make me sad.
I'm sorry, but I wasn't looking at you.
I was thinking.
You were looking at me, but you didn't see me?
Can't we play something happier?
I don't know, a fox-trot, a one-step?
Miss, if I may,
I'll change the record.
Good, you take care of it.
I'll go back to my boyfriend.
Here you are.
Why did you leave like that?
Are you angry?
Did I do something?
- What? No.
- And so?
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
What happened? Why did you leave me?
Well, I just looked around.
Why? Are you upset?
A little.
I'm sorry.
You didn't get offended, did you?
- Well, yes!
- I'm sorry.
You better be.
Oh, well, it's okay.
You know, there was a guy after me.
Do you know what I told him?
That you were my boyfriend.
Do you mind?
I wish.
Are you kidding?
What a face.
Why are you always so down?
What do you have?
Nothing. It's like that.
Maybe it's spring.
Beautiful cows.
I love the smell of lemons.
Smell.
Do you like it?
Funny, this morning I was thinking it's too bad you're Salomè's cousin.
Why?
You stupid.
We could... do it.
Unfortunately, I can't.
It's something. I don't know, and I can't understand why.
Why, if you're not in the mood, you're not in the mood, that's all.
So, you're telling me that you don't like me.
No, I like you. Too much.
That's why it's better not to.
What no and no?
Yes, damn it.
I'm sorry, may I?
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
If you want, I have a little room.
It's my brother-in-law's.
We don't, well, allow it, but for Sir Spatoletti, if you like.
I'm serious. You're doing me a favor.
I have those two little girls around.
If they came here...
They're two angels.
I wouldn't like...
You understand.
Please, no compliments.
Follow me.
Looks like my parent's home. Look.
Like my mother, always knitting.
Here and there and it's all knitting, and we don't have any socks.
Hey, Curly.
No, don't be stupid.
Don't cry.
Oh, shit, what's happening to me?
Listen, get undressed. Let's make love.
Why all this respect for me?
Did you forget who I am?
I'm Tripolina! What are you waiting for?
Get undressed. Come to bed.
Let's make love, right now, so I can get rid of this craziness!
What's happening to you?
Calm down, okay?
What are you waiting for?
At the whorehouse, they wait in line to come with Tripolina.
Come on, let's make love.
Let's do it, and maybe you'll give me a present later.
Come to bed.
Take off your pants, quick.
Stop looking at me with those eyes.
Get undressed. Let's make love without problems, without staring.
You'll see. You'll like it.
I'm good, quick.
Stop it, damn it.
Stop!
Listen, it doesn't have to be like this.
Everything becomes bad like this.
It could be nice, no?
Don't hurt me.
What? We'll be nice to each other, Curly.
Oh, my God! Did you see your cousin?
He's been screwing for three hours.
Who could imagine it, that loser.
Shut up, you pig!
Tonino is a country boy.
He's never had this kind of fun.
Let him get it out of his system.
Getting it out is one thing, but is he going to do it 12 times?
Who is he? Joe Fuck?
He's a loser! He's a hair head!
He's probably sleeping.
Cousin! Wake up! Put your pants on!
It's late! It's time to go! Move it!
Get your ass down here! Come on!
I'm gonna kick his ass.
It's very late. Zoraide will kill us for waking her up at this hour.
Shut up! You snagged my hose.
Now who's gonna buy me new ones?
Look, don't make me fall.
What's the hurry? If I feel like it,
I might do it again, here on the wall.
A kiss, okay, Blondie?
You know, fucking is good for you.
Are you coming tomorrow? Come after 11, when we're closed. I'll be waiting.
Come on, let's do it right here, right now!
Stop it. I told you I'm tired.
Damn it!
Shit, what a scene.
You're having the altar boy defend you. That ugly face.
You asshole, don't even joke, or I'll kick your ass!
Don't even think of provoking Spatoletti.
What are you doing?
Enough now!
You fucking men.
Let us sleep, fuck!
All right. Heard Zoraide? Stop it.
Come on, Tripoli, let's go sleep.
Come on, don't go.
Stay here with me.
Stop it now! Enough!
You've been pinching my ass all day!
Where do you think you're working?
In a church? This is a whorehouse.
Thank God.
And the ladies are whores.
Enough, shut the hell up! Keep your hands off her. Remember, faggot!
What? You bitch! Call your own son a faggot! Got it? Did you hear that?
That Zoraide.
I've known her for 10 years.
Let's drink.
Nice day. We ate, we drank, we laughed we belched, we fucked and we farted.
And we shat! What more do you want?
A perfect Sunday.
You know what we're gonna do now?
We're gonna wander around.
I think it's late.
Don't be an asshole.
Don't you feel the fresh breeze?
At this hour I still love to wander around and beat somebody.
Like with the squad, when we were hunting the anarchists... and making them drink castor oil.
That was great.
Hello, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
From up there you can see the light... at the Venice palace. He's there.
He works for everybody, even for you.
Duce, you're the light. It's true.
If I was you, Emperor...
I wouldn't be so calm on that horse.
Some day they could take you down... and put him up there.
What a man. What a man.
Have you ever seen him up close? No?
Then you don't understand shit.
When I see him, I tremble.
He's got a pair of eyes, man... that can even bring the dead back to life.
If you see them, they tell you he can take the whole world if he wants.
I tell you, he's a superior being.
A superman like him is born once in a century.
I tell you, you can't find men with balls like that.
And the rest? Which ones?
The losers, like the people?
The mass, the beggars, little hungry men.
Ready to shit in their pants and sell themselves right on the spot.
They would even sell their sister and their ass for a piece of bread.
That's the people.
The people.
Those socialist pigs were fattening themselves with the people, damn it!
It's the extreme poverty, sir.
You know, courage is for gentlemen.
Me, for example.
I'm from a farming family.
And my mother, the priest and everybody taught me this:
"Better to kneel down and live than stay put and die."
That's it. The morale of the losers.
Well, we can make them have the balls.
And to do that we need to kick them and order them.
And if they won't, beat them, shit!
Give me the bottle.
Oh, sure. But it's dangerous because you can end up like that bartender.
What are talking about?
What are you blabbering about?
In my town, the bartender had a dog.
He was always kicking him, every day.
But the dog always went back to the bartender, licking his hand, to eat.
He was hungry, you know?
And the bartender kept kicking him.
But one day the dog got angry and after the first kick he started to bite.
And then?
You won't believe it, but he never let go, until the bartender was dying... on the street with foam coming out of his mouth.
Well?
What I mean is that maybe one evening a loser, a crazy loser like me.
He's gonna be pissed off.
You come there with your strong hand... and zap! You get stabbed in the stomach. That's an example.
The man hasn't been born that could stab Spatoletti.
You never know in this world.
Really, I'm serious.
With all these poor people, you never know what someone could do.
The stabbing. Maybe one day someone will think about it and you know.
There are so many desperate people.
Desperate people are crazy.
I don't care!
It feels so good here in the arms of the god, Tevere.
You feel like Jupiter, god of Rome.
Nothing is better than Rome, anywhere.
You can see all Rome from up here.
Wickedness, betrayal, scumbags.
How many do you hide? Rome the capital.
7 hills full of shit and snakes, but he only takes care of the little things.
If he would listen to me, opportunists, anarchists, traitors, subversives.
We should have gotten rid of them, even today. I'd just need a sign.
Imagine, it's fun for me.
It's like a party.
I killed more than 100 with these hands, but now we need to calm down.
According to him we need to be politicians. You know what?
I'll probably go wake up Salomè, that beautiful bitch. What a woman.
You know a Fascist doesn't pay women, he takes them.
But with Salomè, it's another story.
You pay her, all right.
Because she's got something special.
So much that there's a line... at the brothel for her.
Because she's a real tramp.
I don't know if you can understand, being her cousin.
While your Tripolina doesn't have any juice. I've been with her... and I know whores very well, and Tripolina, poor little one...
Shit, enough now! You've been bragging all evening! Enough!
- Enough! Or I'll kick your butt!
- Get out of here!
Don't even mention their names!
Got it, asshole?
- All this for Tripolina?
- I'm the loser, not guys like you!
Oh, boy, the baby's in love.
In love!
Watch it!
I'll kick your ass!
I'm gonna kick you in the balls!
I'll kick your ass, bastard!
You're crazy!
Look at this loser!
He's in love with a prostitute, and he takes it out on me.
I'm right, and I feel sorry for you.
You're drunk as hell!
You better leave now, asshole!
If I catch you, I'll throw you in the fountain and sober you up.
Go away!
They're whores!
Are you crazy?
You're still here?
I wanna come in.
My lord, this faggot again.
Do you wanna let us sleep?
Tripoli, my ass.
Will you go away?
Do I have to call the police?
Slam the door in his face, or he'll throw up on the rugs.
Go, go, go! I'll call the police!
Close the door!
Are you leaving?
Think you're smart?
Slam that door!
His foot's in the door.
Take out your foot, asshole.
No, ma'am.
Tripoli!
Is he Salomè's cousin?
Yes, I want in.
Let me in, Madam.
Come in at this hour? Are you crazy?
Go, get out. Close the door, Zoraide.
Go away with your two feet!
Actually with only one!
Shit, right on my big toe!
Fuck, it hurts!
You hurt me!
- I meant to hurt you.
- You old witch!
You can walk so go to bed.
Go to sleep and come back tomorrow to visit Salomè, maybe at lunchtime.
Fucking bitch. You damn witch.
This isn't the way. Hurting people.
Ugly monkey. She broke my foot, and my shoes were already hurting me.
Shit, my toenail is gonna come off.
Go away, you!
Go, stupid! Go away!
What do you want from me?
What? What are you doing?
I'm not a little pussycat, you know.
Hello, kitty.
Hello, stupid!
Where are you going?
Go home.
Why are you following me?
I'm not a pussycat.
And you're young for those things.
You're still here?
Did they kick you out like me?
Are you alone, kitty?
It's dark, isn't it?
Maybe it's because of all these lights... but the night is scarier here than in the country. It's darker.
What are you doing now?
You're comfortable in my arms?
Listen to me.
Go look for a warm corner.
You're better off without me.
Got it?
You're alone, that's it.
Shit, look at this Rome.
Do you have a home, kitty?
I'm gonna take you to my room now.
But listen, you're making a big mistake... because today I'm here, but tomorrow who knows where I'll be?
Boy, you're a sharpshooter.
Where did you learn, in the army?
No, another round, please.
My God, you've been shooting all morning.
This way I free up my mind.
For that you need a girlfriend, not a rifle, believe me.
Right.
Boy, I'll read your hand.
I'll tell you the future. Yes?
No. No, better not, but thanks for the thought.
So do you have a girlfriend or not?
- Yes and no.
- Yeah?
Why aren't you with her if you need to free up your mind?
She's working.
What does she do?
Can I know what she does?
Commerce.
Come on, beauties, we're opening the whorehouse.
Hello, prostitutes!
Ah, do you want some help to get it up, professor?
Fuck you! This jerk is always a pain in the ass!
Go fuck yourself!
Look, professor! What is this?
The morning of flabbiness?
The morning of the faggots?
Let's go to my room!
Let's go. The first fuck is always the best!
Let's go, guys!
Leave me alone! I don't have time to waste! What's your name, honey?
So, what are we going to do, sir?
Are we going or not?
What's this crowd this morning?
The Fascist gathering is going on!
I can't understand why when a military gathering is going on... everyone has to stop by the whorehouse.
Maybe the horns?
See, looks like this morning is going to be a good morning, Madam.
Is there a problem? Introduction maybe?
What are you, gay? Come on...
Why are you all still dressed?
Come on. Go up to the rooms.
God bless you!
Where do you think you are?
In the barracks?
Carmela, don't you recognize me?
What an ass!
It's like a flower today.
Who's gonna deflower me this morning?
Bologna is coming on track number 4.
What a blonde!
What a crowd.
Salomè from Bologna's here.
I've got 15 minutes free.
Any gourmets want to try a new dish?
Shoot. What a pain.
Whoever wants me, follow me.
Oh, well, a man of good taste?
Let's go, let's go.
This morning is not that good, girls.
Tripoli, land of love.
Tripolina's coming.
Hey, you.
Is he deaf?
What a beautiful beard, professor.
Are we going up?
Shoot. Have you seen it? Hall and room.
They might even give us a medal now.
Have you lost your head looking at all these nude women?
What have you done since this morning?
You've got no money.
You're a student. Get out.
Come on, take them up to your rooms, girls.
Tonino, what are you doing here?
Here for breakfast?
No.
Don't tell me you're a client?
For relatives I have a special deal.
I'm all yours, okay?
Obviously after hours.
I've got to go.
Today's a busy day for fucking.
Listen, go for it. I'll give you a half hour you'll never forget.
Today I'm gonna show you my whole repertoire, like in a movie.
Admiral... sailor... faggot.
The cousin.
Are you looking for Salomè?
She's fixing herself up.
She picked a fat turkey, the honorable Pezzotto's son.
She got him in her room.
She screwed him for a half hour.
She can smell a rich one a mile away.
Where's that ship captain...
Bye, Fefè, come again.
I'll treat you nice.
It's hot! Worse than in Catania.
Have you been in Catania? Yes or no?
Bye-bye, and come back to visit me, professor.
Hey! Tripolina's here...
Where are you going, son of a bitch?
I'm paying. I've got the same rights as anyone else. Seven lire, shit.
Quick, this is rush hour.
Today is crowded. Let's move it.
No, Tonino, no.
That's private. No, Tony.
Well, what's this?
I'm sorry.
Look, leave me alone, okay?
What did you do?
What? Leave you alone?
Tonino, wait. Listen, Tonino.
Tonino, open up.
The cousin with Tripolina?
That's funny. He's in love, isn't he?
Hey, Salomè, are you jealous?
Stop being a pain in the ass, or I'll rip your heart out.
Why are you behaving like this?
What's wrong?
I can't watch you do this. You'll have to stay with me a couple of days.
What are you saying?
Two days.
Will you stay two days with me?
Two days, and then?
Then I have to go away.
Don't ask, damn it!
Are you gonna stay with me?
I've lost my mind for you, and I'll do anything, but tell me the truth.
There's nothing to say.
Nothing!
Sure! Do you think I'm stupid?
You've got something.
I've known it since I met you.
Sometimes you're like a crazy man.
Tell me the truth.
Stop it.
I can't tell you anything.
Just tell me if you're staying two days with me or not.
You don't trust me?
I love you.
It's not trust. It's just that the less you know the better.
Oh, well, it's the same anyway.
Do you see this bullet?
This "B" and this "M"?
Look at it, Tripolina.
I'm here to put this bullet in Benito Mussolini's head.
My God!
You're an anarchist?
Now, my love, my life is in your hands.
Wait, wait a moment.
If you wanna get killed by the Fascists then leave now.
I'm going back down to work, to have them abuse me... so I don't think about it anymore.
It was too beautiful.
Get out.
Leave me alone.
This is the worst.
No, no, it's not the worst.
I told it to myself too.
But, Tripoli, listen, many people will never have two days of love.
Don't throw it away like this!
You're the one that wants to.
Why? For politics? Who cares? Why?
Why? Well, because sometimes someone has to say enough.
You feel you have to do it. Anyway I have to do this, and I'll do it.
Understand?
No, I just know that when someone is born unfortunate, she remains so.
Calm down, baby.
Calm down, Curly.
What? A two-day permit in the middle of all this?
Tripolina, you're not a teenager in love. Do you know that?
Then I'm sorry, Madam.
I'll take my two days and go.
You're going? No problem.
But look, if you're gonna do it...
I'll ruin you. You can count on it.
You're off the A-list, I tell you.
And for what? For that farmer with that ugly face? Come on, stupid?
You don't know men. They come, fuck and go away. Come on, go away!
And remember, you're under contract.
These are expensive whims!
I've never got anything from life for free.
I've seen many end up on the sidewalk for love.
It doesn't matter.
Stupid, idiot, jerk.
Still believe in Santa Claus, eh?
Isn't it enough at your age to be a prostitute in this whorehouse?
Madam, the Commendatore is not feeling good. He's white like milk.
I was working, and he had an attack.
He's shaking.
Pull! Put him on the bed.
Get him!
Get him up there!
Shit, he's heavy, poor guy!
Look how pale he is.
Careful, careful.
Put him on the bed, Maurizia! Shit!
Call Zoraide. Not a word to anyone!
To anyone! Not even the girls.
Who's this Giuliana?
Who's she? His wife.
She died not long ago, poor soul.
Otherwise, I'll throw all of you out, okay?
I'll take care of it, Madam.
Shit! The papers. And, honey, continue with the vinegar massage.
But, it's disgusting.
Disgusting? If you'd do your job well, this wouldn't happen.
Poor guy.
He's an old guy who's sick.
What? That's it? Nothing else in the pockets? Are you sure?
Poor guy. Is it true that he lost his wife a year ago?
Yes, she died last year, shit!
A good client. He was always here to spend time with us girls.
He said that the smell of youth made him feel like a new man.
He's frozen.
He's in agony.
We've got to get him out of here.
Isn't it better to ask a big shot?
The police commissioner's nephew, a general. They're all good clients.
Yes, sure. You find one that's willing to expose himself for us.
Come on, Nina! Wake up.
We've got to get rid of him.
He can die anywhere but here.
I don't want dead people around. Go!
Sure, like it's easy, right?
Easy or not, we've got to do it, period.
- I'm here. Madam, did you want me?
- Come here, Zoraide.
Oh, shit, is he dead?
Listen, Zoraide, does your brother still have his carriage around here?
Sure, he leaves it around the corner.
Should I call him?
Call him right away.
He looks better, but it's safer to take him home.
So?
I don't know Rome that well.
Where should I take that guy?
Right around the corner, at the forum.
Nobody's around at this hour, not even the cats. It's all the same to him.
To me, on the other hand...
You're saving me a lot of trouble.
Then, Ninni, if you do me this favor,
I'll give you Tripolina.
Tripolina is a gold mine for us until the day after tomorrow.
With meals, lodging, linen.
Everything free and loving.
And look, I wouldn't do this even for Benito Mussolini.
Listen you! I knew he was crazy, but you? What is this?
You're framing my cousin while I'm working?
Carmela, I ordered maximum discretion.
No, who talked?
I didn't say a word!
Sure, everybody's talking downstairs.
Anyway Tonino can't do these things!
I didn't know you were his manager.
Anyway he's an adult.
And then, if he does me a favor,
I'll do a favor for him.
Sure, bringing him oranges in jail.
There is no need to talk.
My cousin won't do it. It's dangerous.
Come on! The lady says that nobody's around now, not even the cats. Right?
So?
She's saying that! What if a cop catches you carrying a dead man?
What will you say? I said you're not going to do it. It's dangerous!
Enough now, all right? I said I'm going, and that's the end of it. Let's go.
- Wait, Tonino.
- Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Don't be a pain!
If he goes, I go.
Got it?
Are you crazy? Carmela's going.
What do I tell the guys who want Salomè?
Tell them that Salomè's fallopian tubes shut down.
Hurry, move it.
Hurry. Please, be careful!
What do I do with it?
Come on, hurry.
- Come on. Jump up.
- Let's go.
Watch it!
Go? Let's go.
Stay here and warn us if someone comes.
No, no.
I'm coming with you and Carmela.
He's heavy.
She has varicose veins. Wait here.
I prefer to wait here.
I don't feel well.
Pay attention, come on.
Come on, behind those columns.
It's more private. Hurry up!
Listen to me. If you've got something to say, say it.
Listen, a joke is a joke.
And I like to joke. Life is a bitch.
If you don't laugh at it, better to shoot yourself, and that's it.
But someone like you. With what you have to do. It's different, you know.
I know what to do.
No, you don't! Because I imagined you like a saint, someone without room... for anything except those who suffered and died for the cause.
Why? Don't I suffer?
I don't want to die here.
Yes, but you're risking everything because you fell in love!
So, take Tripolina, go to France and stop thinking of all the rest of it.
Giuliana, forgive me.
Commendatore, calm down.
Don't get excited, Commendatore.
Do you feel better?
There, put him there.
Come on, Commendatore, it's nothing.
It's the hot weather, come on.
You feel better now, right?
He's dead.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry!
How did it go?
Good, nice.
I had a nice sight-seeing tour.
I was so scared.
I'm sorry, but I've got to talk to Salomè. Wait here.
But... Wait, Tonino.
What are you doing here? Go!
Go make love to your Tripolina.
You'll see, after a couple of days of exercise, you'll be shooting like hell.
You won't be able to even pick up your gun. Go! I don't want to talk to you.
Listen, I'll probably die in two days.
I need to stay here.
Who knows what's going to happen now!
I can't stay in that hotel alone anymore. Look how shaky my hand is.
I'm always thinking about it. About that moment, when I'll have to shoot.
And shit, I feel like I'm dying.
I get something here.
I'm scared like hell. That's why
I took care of that poor guy.
To see if I could win it over.
You won, right? And now you're not going to be upset, are you?
Fear is normal. The Fascists are not scared and kill people, but you...
You're an anarchist.
Yes, anarchist. Drop it, okay?
I'm not Michael Sgaravento.
I'm Antonio Soffiantini, and that's it.
What does that mean?
You're a comrade.
Yes, well. I've just recently become involved in this.
I joined after I saw the police shoot
Michael Sgaravento in the back.
Nothing before. Antonio Soffiantini was just a simple farmer. That's it.
One of many.
While him...
Shit, Michael was different!
I'm a joke.
While him, even in that bush, dead, with his mouth full of mud.
He looked like a king.
What's all this bullshit?
Come on, get it out!
Are you one of the Brighenti group or a loner?
I'm nobody, that's it.
I was a friend of Michael's.
Like a brother. When he came back, he confided only in me.
"I'm back to kill Mussolini."
That's exactly what he told me.
He told me everything. He left me the suitcase. He trusted only me.
He told me, "If something happens, take this to the comrades."
As if he knew.
So why are you involved?
I'm involved because I saw him killed like that. I sold the cow...
I got the suitcase,
I took it to Brighenti in Paris... and I told him that I would come here to kill Mussolini.
They taught me how to shoot, and here I am.
Listen, Tonino, have you given it some thought?
Michael, you know, was a dedicated anarchist. He dedicated his life to it.
But you, I mean, maybe at the time you thought of revenge.
But now, if you don't feel like it, you shouldn't do it.
Something like this is a desperate act.
There's no way out.
Do you think
I'll end up like Anteo?
Forget Anteo. If they arrest you, an execution is your destiny.
Or worse, the Saint Antonio.
Saint Antonio?
They'll beat you to death, and no one will know a thing.
What do you want to do? Scare me?
Save it, because I'm so scared... that you can't even imagine.
But I have to do this.
Even if I'm not an anarchist now, maybe they'll make me one later.
Look, I promised myself I wouldn't go back to that slave life.
Day after day, only to die like a dog.
I can't do it anymore.
A farm rat lives better than us.
I promised myself, and this action...
This action is what I need to feel like a man.
Maybe now you don't trust me.
No, it's not about trust.
It's this war we're fighting.
You don't even know why you're doing it.
You're the one to be sacrificed, and you're not involved at all.
Once I've killed Mussolini,
I'll be involved, right?
Yes. Enough now, it'll be okay.
Go with the girl.
She's waiting behind the door like a puppy.
When you look at her, she starts to cry.
Poor Tripoli. Life has already been so bad to her. Go, now.
Good morning. This is really funny.
I knew the cousin lost it for you.
The other night? This jerk almost crushed a bottle on my head.
I didn't break him because I was merciful.
He was drunk as hell, Tripolina.
Who knows? Maybe you found the jerk who's going to marry you.
Best wishes.
Pardon.
These, Tonino, are our passports.
The comrades delivered them.
It's better to cross the border legally as emigrants than illegally.
Because if everything goes well and Mussolini dies... you'll see many problems with those jerks at the border.
Right. If everything goes well, then we'll see.
I'll wake you up at six o'clock.
Everything will be okay. You'll see.
Put this stuff away, now.
Don't make this kitty wait for you.
Isn't love beautiful?
But look where it's going.
I'm sorry, honey, but I've got to sleep, at least a little.
Love, my love.
Hey, girl.
You're always crying, you know?
Come here, don't do this.
You're making it worse.
So, Curly.
It was beautiful, wasn't it?
The two of us alone, like a honeymoon.
Two days only for us.
They're gone. And now?
Now we've got to sleep, and that's all.
And she's crying again...
Listen, Curly,
I want to tell you something.
You're the best thing that's happened in my life.
What are you doing up?
Is he up already? We must wake him.
No, you will not wake him up.
- Are you crazy?
- Come, I need to talk to you.
Don't be stupid.
It's late already.
If you wake him up,
I'm going to report you and him.
Let's go.
Let's talk in the bathroom.
Okay. And now?
Now, you will not wake him.
He's sound asleep... and when he wakes, it must be too late.
Listen, baby, get out of the way.
You were never involved to begin with.
This is not a teenage romance.
Give me the key.
No! I know it's the cause and all the rest. But you're not waking him up!
Because no cause is worth a poor, young guy having to die... like a dog. You know?
Because he will die like a dog.
Of course he will die like a dog.
Like all the others even younger and more innocent than him.
I saw them with my eyes. He knows it too, but it's the same for him... because he'd rather die like a dog than live like a dog.
But only after he does what he has to do. Yes, you die for these things!
All of us are ready to die for this dream!
Get out of the way!
You cannot understand.
And give me the key!
Bastard! No. Watch it because
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
You're not going to wake him!
I'll kill you!
What do you want to do?
Are you truly crazy?
I'll kill you! Yes, I'll kill you!
And then I'll kill myself.
I don't care to live anymore.
You've got a black heart. You don't care about that poor creature.
He's got that nice cause.
Sure, it's the cause.
Maybe one day it'll happen, and what if it doesn't?
But he's got to die this morning.
If you wake him up... you're killing him!
With those dirty hands! Bastard!
Shut up! Don't scream.
Do you think you're doing him a favor?
It's his decision. When he wakes up, he will hate you, you know?
I know. He won't see me anymore.
He'll leave full of hatred but alive.
- That's enough for me.
- I can't!
That pig has to die.
I promised a guy that died.
He trusted me. I can't listen to you.
I don't want to!
You must listen.
Because you want to wake him for another reason: You're jealous.
Up yours!
You're jealous, and I beg you to help me save him. I know you care about him.
Of course I care about him.
He just fell into this mess... like a bug into a glass.
It's even worse than Anteo.
He's so young that my heart breaks.
I would go if I knew how to shoot.
Too late!
I can't afford these feelings.
Feelings are a luxury, and this is war!
What would happen if all women stopped their soldiers at the door during war?
You die in war. It would be great if every mother did that. Why not?
Why? For history?
For justice?
They've been fighting since the creation of the world.
Explain it to me, all this justice.
The dead stay dead, and that's it.
Damn you. And damn me.
Fucking sentimental whores that we are.
Open up the door. I can't stand this bullshit any longer. Go away.
They're right, never trust a whore.
Why didn't you wake me? Why?
Why, fucking traitor? Traitor!
It's ten o'clock. I'm ruined.
Why didn't you wake me up?
And you, fucking whore, why didn't you call me? Why?
Because right now you'd be dead with a bullet in your chest.
I'm worse than dead now. Like a worm sleeping in the whores' bed.
That's what you are to me, whores!
What am I going to do now?
I'll kill myself. I'll do it.
Where's my gun?
Where is it!
Wait, Tonino, stop!
I'm going to put that bullet in my forehead anyway. Fucking whores. Go!
Stop the crying.
We've got to stop him.
Shut up, Tonino, shut up.
You're gonna ruin everything. Shut up!
Coming... Stop it.
What the hell do you want?
Open up, Salomè.
Now we can't even have a family discussion, damn it.
Fucking bitches. Everybody behind the door like chickens.
Mind your own business!
Got it?
Salomè! This has nothing to do with it.
You know I don't allow confusion here.
What do I care?
It sounded like you were killing each other.
Look who's talking. The other day, this one and the Spanish girl... screamed like hell over a pair of underwear. Get a life!
Oh, shit. They're coming for me.
They're going to arrest me. Arrest me.
Calm down.
Stay calm. Shut up.
What am I going to do now?
They're here for me. You betrayed me.
Stop with this bullshit. Nobody betrayed you. You know it. Calm down.
I can't end up like this. They're coming. I knew it. They betrayed me.
What do I do?
What did you do to me?
Love! I'm sick. I'm scared like hell.
What did you do to me?
Tonino, don't do this. Listen.
Nobody betrayed you, you know it.
We did it only to save you and for love.
I love you two also.
Don't leave me.
Enough, Tonino!
I'm going down to delay them.
You and Tripolina, go out the back.
She's got some money, and you can take mine too. It's in the last drawer.
The gun's there.
You'll make it. You'll see.
Go to Paris, to Saverio Brighenti.
Understand? Saverio Brighenti!
Mother, please don't leave me.
My mother!
Enough. Don't waste time!
And don't be upset with yourself.
Not everyone has to be a hero, damn it!
Come on, Tonino. Here's the money, the passports and the gun.
What are you doing? Come on, honey,
I'll help you. Why do you do this?
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.
We're going to make it.
No, baby, no, calm down.
I'm going to calm down now, you'll see.
No, what do you want to do?
Let's go! Let's get out of here.
No, I'm not going to escape anymore. Go!
Tonino, shut up.
For God's sake, don't go!
It's done. It's the end.
I won't escape anymore.
The medical checkup is on Thursday, Lieutenant.
In any case, the girls are in order.
They're up in their rooms.
You're at home here. If you want to come in, you know the way, right?
Yes, ma'am, I know the way.
Who's that?
Shit, he's armed!
I wanted to kill Mussolini!
Tonino!
Escape, Tonino!
Tonino!
Escape, get away!
Long live anarchy!
Tonino! Bastards, leave him!
Killers!
Stop that car!
I wanted to kill Mussolini for all of you comrades... equal and free like nature created us.
I wanted to kill Mussolini!
Watch it, Tonino! Not like this.
Not like Anteo! Killers! Stop them!
Make him shut up!
Tonino! Tonino!
My love!
Stop, stop. Do something.
He was doing it for you.
For you who are slaves, and don't even know it, you cowards!
He was a poor guy with a big heart.
Better than all of you!
Enough, that's enough.
I'm sorry, Captain. Take him up.
Like this. Here, take this cigarette.
Do you want to talk?
So, sir Soffiantini. Your jail is going to be 30 feet under the sea.
Air comes in through a little pipe.
Little air and no light.
Complete darkness. They lock you up, and you stay there in silence.
Nobody talking to you.
Sooner or later you go crazy.
Pasanante was found eating his own shit.
He became green, flabby, and without hair he looked like a worm.
But, with some names and addresses, we've got mental infirmity.
I give you my word.
Maybe ten years and that's it.
Who sent you?
Are you part of the Brighenti gang?
Say it. Are you with the Brighenti gang?
Are you from Paris?
From America?
Who sent you?
You don't think I'd believe you came to Rome alone to kill Benito Mussolini?
Who sent you?
What'd you say?
I don't know anything about anybody.
Shoot me, it's better that way.
Fucking anarchist! I'll teach you!
Anarchy, shit!
Go, take him away!
Give him a nice treatment.
Tough guy, huh?
Because he's got to talk. He has to.
Hello, Captain Fautasso. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Don't you worry. Bye, sir.
They don't want it known.
He prefers it.
The number of these bastards has tripled lately, huh?
What are telling me, Captain?
The Italians love the Duce.
It's been years since we've heard of any popular unrest.
Then again, instead of killing them like they deserve, he pardons them.
Oh, dear. What are you talking about?
What pardon? Who got a pardon?
The last two, the ones we know, yes.
But what others?
He's a hero, but he's not stupid.
It's better to make some people disappear without publicity.
And this is one more case like that.
It's faster. More political, right?
Damn it!
Go ahead!
This morning at ten o'clock in Via dei Fiori... in the well-known whorehouse... an unknown man... hit by a fit of madness... fired some shots at a police unit... during a routine inspection.
Once arrested the unknown man killed himself... by violently beating his head... against the wall of his cell.
Mother!
I want to repeat my horror at attacks that were not only bad but stupid... because they hurt the cause they were supposed to serve.
But the assassins are also saints and heroes... who will be celebrated once the brutal facts are forgotten... and remembered only for the idea that inspired them... and the martyrdom that rendered them saints.
I had to help wash him so I saw him naked. 
I never realised he was so small, so short
Yes, Inspector...
Judge Varga used to come here every Sunday.
He liked talking to the mummies.
He'd make the dead reveal the secrets of the living.
-He'd talk to the mummies?
-Of course.
You're from Rome. There are some things you can't understand.
Open it.
See him?
Bernardo da Corleone a great 17th century lawyer.
In those days the dead person's family would come and tell the deceased their secrets.
And our Don Bernardo, who at the time was still alive, would come down to the crypt at night and get the corpses to tell him everything.
So he knew everthing about everybody.
Everything about everybody.
"Let me talk about little white jasmines..."
This fatal,just-picked blossom symbolises the purity of his existence.
And its scent evokes the goodness he brought to the courts and to his family.
It was this Spring blossom which caught the last breath of Judge Varga, who will now appear before the ultimate Judge and be admitted to His Kingdom.
For thirty years he fought against crime and the Mafia, and the Mafia has killed him.
He was the Mafia!
He was the Mafia!
Organised crime has never been so daring before.
It's the first time a judge has been murdered.
Mafia! You're the Mafia!
You're the Mafia!
It's an appalling crime aimed against the whole judiciary... and it's a challenge to the State's authority!
Why is your name linked to the dead judge and garbage? 
They attack me because I was his best friend.
What about the garbage?
Come and have a look.
Hear that?
They're not striking for more pay.
They even have cars to come to work.
They're starting a cholera epidemic just to screw me.
Where does Judge Varga come into it?
Varga was murdered because he was about to arrest them.
Not these wretches, but their puppeteers.
Give me a hand.
This guy's dead.
He has no pulse.
Judge Varga knew every secret behind every door.
He had drawers full of court files.
He acted on some, but ignored the others.
You were his friend.
You admired him, didn't you?
I liked the man.
He wasn't in it for money.
He thrived on power.
Inspector.
A  phone call from Rome.
Sorry. I need your authorisation to move elsewhere right away.
Where?
They killed another judge some 100km from here
The two crimes may be linked.
Go, but keep me informed.
The Minister is concerned.
Shall we arrest him?
Why?
As usual, they won't talk.
This guy heard nothing, saw nothing, knows nothing.
Do you get many lemons?
Alot. They want to cut it down to build houses
Tell me something ...
Did you know the judge?
Of course. He issued the orders to resume the farms. 
What was he like?
Like this town...
Just what they wanted.
Sargeant.
Captain.
Is this you?
It might be.
Did you bring us all this way just to identify a photo?
Why were you at Judge 
Varga's funeral?
Were you a friend too?
We had ceased to be on friendly terms.
But when he was a junior judge...
When you killed that unionist...
Everyone was acquitted.
Sure. But this time you've gone too far.
You shouln't mess with judges.
Inspector, you're wasting your time with us. And you know it.
If it's payback as you call it, that's between the judges.
Brave Chief Judge Calamo is dead.
He's the third judge to be killed.
The police do nothing to stop this mad slaughter.
And their inertia gives rise to all sorts of speculation.
We're being killed off and our reputations are tarnished.
The judiciary is sound but parliament is ineffective.
The government is weak.
They're the reason the country is plunging into chaos.
Find me that raving maniac.
Only a maniac would go around killing judges.
Get this into your heads.
As chief of police, your head will be the first to roll.
You're our best man , but yours will be the first head to roll.
Stop the damaging stories about the murdered judges.
What's this?
The late Chief Judge Calamo had them in a drawer.
He had several million in the bank.
What on earth are you doing?
Piecing together three lives.
Don't waste time with the dead.
We need somone who's alive and guilty.
Stop looking for rationality.
We're dealing with a paranoid.
If he's paranoid, it's with good reason.
What did you mean by
"paranoid with good reason"?
Three judges have been killed in twenty days, in three towns quite near each other.
All killed the same way, by bullets from the same gun,. which must be a rifle and silencer.
Enough evidence to suggest a vendetta.
A vendetta?
By whom?
A victim of a judicial error.
Do you know whether the three judges were ever on the same case?
Yes.They worked together for eight years
Doctor. The plane is ready to take off.
Let me say one more thing.
Actually I knew there'd be another killing in this town.
I have'nt made a mistake.
I was here when they shot Calamo.
Then the papers are right 
You're a jinx.
Anyway, I've come up with some facts.
Three people from this area were unjustly sent to jail for several years.
A chemist whose wife tricked the judges, a mechanic rumoured to be gay, and a trucker who's now a hobo.
So, what's your next step?
One of the trio is the killer.
- How are things?
- Bad.
- What's bad?
- Everything.
- And before?
- Before what ?
Were things better before?
- No.
- So ?
So... Here we are.
What do you think about these judges being killed?
Were you sentenced by Varga?
He was the prosecuting judge in that trial.
He asked for 30 years.
He said he regretted there was no death penalty.
Did Judge Sanza deliver the sentence?
Judge Sanza gave me a discount... 27 years.
But he wasn't alone.
I know.
Judge Rasto was there too.
And Rasto is still alive.
What do you want from me?
Later they proved
I was innocent.
True.
You were innocent and spent four years in jail.
I've served 52 years unjustly.
Spending four in jail was no big deal.
Jail is a safe place.
- Who's there? What do you want?
- Police.
Leave me alone.
You've made my life miserable.
Enough. Get out of here!
Come here.
Do you remember Judge Varga?
Chief Judge Sanza and the other one Calamo ?
Bastards...
They were all bastards.
And so you killed them.
- I wish I did.
Do you live here?
Have you a gun?
Go and get it.
You get it.  
Clear off!  
You don't answer me like that. Understand?
What shall we do?
No one's seen him.
He might be sleeping.
Stay here and keep an eye out for him.
Yes, doctor.
Is Dr Maxia here.
That's me.
Can I help you?
I'm inspector Rogas.
I'd like a word with you.
At your service.
I'll be back shortly.
Please sit down.
Thanks.
This is what I want to know.
I'm told you're the only friend of the chemist, Cres.
Friend!
It's hard to use the term in Cres' case.
Let's say a frequent caller.
- So you see him often?.
- Yes, yes.
Actually, I'm the one who keeps an eye on him.
I try to get him to mix. with other people.
Seen him today?
- No.
I don't think Cres went out at all today.
I knocked on his door but no one answered.
He ofter pretends he's not at home.
You mean it's happened to you too?
Yes, often.
Cres is always in the house?
Are you sure he couldn't have gone somewhere else.
As far as I know the only trips Cres takes are inside the walls of his own house.
- See?  He's not here.
- So he does go out?
Then, it's not true that he's not always here?
Strange.  Maybe he's left.
I'll go see if he switched the meter off.
What's all this music?
Cres is crazy about tangos.
He collected thousands of them, inspector.
Tangos of all kinds, from lots of places
He's put speakers all over the house.
This is the wife of Cres.
She used animal welfare to frame him.
Do you think 
Cres was innocent too?
He prepared the chocolate rice.
He cooked it quite ofter.
Yes, my husband !
Well then do any doubts still linger?
No.  Not unless we think this poor woman designed a diabolical scheme to incriminate her husband.
Even to the extent of sacrificing a life, of a poor innocent cat.
For years the only companion in her lonely existence.
That would be absurd!
He wanted to murder his wife.
He set up a fake suicide.
You must find him guilty.
The woman, where is she now ?
Your guess is as good as mine.
She took off while he was still in jail.
She stripped half the house, and left him with her portrait.
And he's placed it in front of his bed.
Doctor!
Is the headless figure Cres?
I think so.
Maybe his wife did it out of spite.
Who was next to you here?
Probably Cres.
Probably?
Don't you have any photographs of Cres?
I did have a few, but he took them all back.
Who is it?
I'm inspector Rogas.
Come in.
The judge is is waiting for you.
Come in.
The police inspector is here.
Your honour.
Good evening.
Inspector Rogas.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Certainly
Well?
Forgive me for calling on you at this hour.
But I've been trying in vain to see Mr Cres, the chemist.
But his house is locked.
And no one is answering.
What do you want with the chemist?
Nothing in particular.
I looked up his file..... a strange case indeed.
I need to put a face to it.
I want to meet the man.
But the Cres trial has no link with anything nowadays.
It was much talked about.
And the sentence was very controversial.
Weren't you one of the judges?
I was only the recorder.
The decision was made by 
Judge Varga and Chief Judge Sanza .
And they've both been killed.
Forty metres.
They fired from over there.
Who lives there?
It's a condemned building
A fire was lit in one of the rooms.
The killer must have spent the night there.
He must have known the judges' habit pretty well.
Aren't they removing the corpse?
Doctor, there's an ambulance strike.
We can't find a vehicle.
Use one of our cars.
Do you need the union's approval?
Were you really here when he was shot?
Not  exactly. 
I saw the judge last night... but I didn't kill him.
Why did you visit the judge?
Nothing important,
Just routine .
Surely you must have some clues...
It's the fourth since you began investigating.
Gentlemen, talk to the local police.
Inspector, our readers want to know...
Hey!
Ah. Look who's here!
One judge is a police matter, but kill four, it's political.
So you'll give me a political interpretation.
Don't you read the papers?
No, especially yours.
Good!
Let's get away from here.
Your colleagues won't give me peace !
Come on.  
Get into my car!
Too bad you don't read  our paper, it's the only one defending you.
Defending me.  How ?
We're not into witch hunts.
We are not about raising tension in the community.
We want to do out jobs.
Without any interference from above.
So that's what you write!
Well done. 
At times the police even suit the Communist Party!
If they all did their job like you do.
But I do it for you.
We were school mates and we went fishing together.
But trust your friends.
It's all politics.
It's your government cronies who play dirty politics.
Listen...
You can be frank with me
- What's behind all this?
- None of what you might think.
Nor of what my government gronies think.
I'll tell you a story, off the record.
A nice story.
It's about a man, his wife and a cat
This one?
No.
This one?
No, I'm afraid not.
This one?
I believe this one resembles him a little.
But it's only a drawing not a photograph!
Enough time's spent on this, we have to finish!
You!
Give me your description again.
Wanted.
A man, 175 cm tall, stocky with greying brown hair. perfect teeth, slightly aquiline nose.
... JUDGE ASSINATED ...
... JUDGE PERRO SHOT DEAD
AT 6.30PM IN ROME ...
These brutal and appalling crimes are an attack on law and order.
MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF STATE
They are the diabolical fruit of the actions... of groups of young agitators who preach violence as a means to an end, and sow seeds of delirium in weaker minds.
It is time to say
'Enough, we will be strong!'
You saw the assassin?
I heard a shot and saw two youths run away. That's all.
You were just passing by at that moment?
Yes but I heard nothing, though.
I was on my bicyle when two youths knocked me over.
Why were you at the scene of the crime ?
I was in the basement, 
I'm a printer.
I went upstairs to get a little fresh air.
I heard a woman shout and saw him on a bicycle.
At last! While you waste your time on your little toy. chasing your phantom lunatic, the true killer is exterminating judges, leaving the country in a state of panic.
Actually, it was you who mentioned lunatics. You came here to tell me.
But you were there and had to see what wasn't there.
Meaning?
Pleas sit down.
I was saying they were everywhere.
At Varga's funeral, where Sanza was killed...
They even set up camp.
A demonstation and a camp site don't prove murder.
What about the eyewitnesses?
There were eyewitnesses to Judge Perro's murder?
Nobody seen him shot, they saw someone run away.
Enough talk.
You're an excellent detective.
The best criminal investigator we've got.
But this now is a political affair.
We have already made too many mistakes.
It is imperative firstly to restore the good name of the police.
You will work with the political squad.. and collaborate with Inspector Bloma.
This way.
Get this to the Minister quickly
Yes Sir.
The telephone calls are continuously recorded?
But where're all the tapes stored?
Don't you worry!
After they're of value to the 
Justice Ministry they destroy them.
Rogas, come here a minute!
Isn't that your friend there?
The communist journalist?
- Is he being watched too?
- No, only his leader... Amar.
"Times are difficult."
"This meeting must end with a clear decision."
"A party like ours can't be surprised... and influenced by the actions of the government."
Let's see what are they sending us now.
Ah the Justice builings.
"Then, the chancillor, wrote:
The demand, response:"
"I have been coming to the capital all these months..."
"I brought cheques from the petroleum companies... to the secretariate of the Christian Democratic Party"
"who then distributes them according to the quota.. to all the other parties, except the Communist party"
"Nothing to the Communists ?
"To the Communists, no."
"To some affilliates of theirs but not much"
Senta! Put in the tape of the shooting of the Z Group.
Si, doctor.
We are monitoring this group's publications, in the last 6 months.
And we focus on articles.. that attack Magistrates and Judges.
Can I have the article from Permanent Revolution?
Thanks.
It's the newspaper of the Group Z.
This is Galano, head of Group Z.
The most fanatical.
Listen what he has writen about judges!
The article is tittled
"The Monsters"
"Bony and withered, often obese and flaccid...
"their faces marked by infamy of their office, every year dressed like clowns as bishops don't dare.
They're the high magistrates who inaugurate the judicial year telling us to lock more people up."
- Stand up!
- Me?
Yes you, stand up.
- Start walking.
- Where?
Walk up and down until we tell you to stop.
Turn round
Start walking
Start walking
Do you recognise him?
Is it him?
¡ Derecho ! Turn round
Start Walking
¡ Adelante !
¡ Muevete !
Do you recognise him?
Is it him?
Back to square one.
The two youths bumped into you and you fell off your bicycle.
I didn't say I fell.
I was knocked over.
Same thing.  You saw them run away.
The darker guy was limping.
I didn't see any dark guy.
It does'nt matter.
But he did have a limp.
Maybe.  It was so quick.
One moment.  How quick?
As a flash.
Then they got into the car.
A car?
You never mentioned a car.
You never gave me a chance.  You kept asking about those youths.
Bring the girl here.
Sit here.
- You saw the car, didn't you ?
- What car?
The car in the street when Judge Perro was shot.
Ah yes, the big foreign car.
How do you mean foreign?
Why didn't you tell us about the car?
So what if there was a car?
I see so many cars in a day.
They're part of my job.
- Was the car parked?
- Yes. It was.
I went up to it to see if
I could do some business...
That's why I noticed it was big, nice and foreign.
- Switzerland
- Then?
Nothing. They started the engine and took off.
- With the youths?
- What youths?
Those hippies.
They suddenly started running.
I saw them get into the car. 
What is he talking about ?
When the car took off, the hippies ran away on foot.
Okay, let's start from scratch.
This is your statement.
I'll read it to you.
'' At 6pm on the 25th, in front of the
Justice Building.
I was about to cross the street,... when I noticed my shoe strap was undone.
I bent down to do it up and heard a shot."
- Then?
- I turned around.
- What did you see?
- Two youths ran into this guy.
- And then?
- They ran off up the street
- And the car?
- Went in the opposite direction
Ha! He couldn't have seen anything... because he was leaning over the dead man.
I insist.
They got into the car.
You were shit scared.
You didn't see anything.
Listen Bloma,
I have thought it over carefully
I won't work with someone else.
Even the chief thought
I wasn't right for this.
Maybe you have a point.
A break will do you good.
Yes but first I have to ease my conscience.
I have to tell a guy he's about to die.
Good morning,inspector.
May I speak to 
Chief Judge Riches?
Who are you? 
I am inspector Rogas.
Wait here.
Inspector.
Come back tomorrow.
He can't see you now.
Okay.
That car it's the 
Police Commissioner's?
- Is he with the judge ?
-  And why are you asking? 
It's not for me.  But at least get in touch with the boy.
By the way the school fees are due.
Don't worry.  You know I've been away.  I'll do it tomorrow.
Marco says he never sees you.
- When did you see him?
- Last Sunday.
- Was he all right?
- Yes, he was fine.
Don't forget the college fees.
Yes yes, bye.
And now a news update
General De Sarmiento was today appointed
Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
He was sworn in before the joint chiefs of the air force, the army and the navy.
The ceremony was followed by a military parade which included a special police unit.
Various diplomats were in attendance...
General de Sarmiento was today appointed
Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
He was sworn in before the joint chiefs of the air force, the army and the navy.
- Is that Rogas? 
- Yes. Good evening doctor.
Why did you visit Riches?
To warn him he's in danger.
So you're still insisting in chasing your lunatic.
The judge will be killed in any case.
The chief judge is well protected.
I know. Today I saw all the security forces at Riches'.
I even spotted your car.
We were'nt with Riches.
We had a function next door at the Portuguse Embassy.
Okay, go and see Riches,.. but don't alarm him.
- Hello
- Hello. The Portuguese Embassy?
- Yes, who's speaking?
- I'm the police commissioner's chauffeur.
My boss forgot his briefcase at today's function.
What function was that ?
The ambassador is away in Lisbon.
Sorry.  It must be a mistake.
Thanks.
- Yes?
- It's Rogas.
- Hi.
- I need a favour.
Find the owner of a white mercedes with Swiss plates.
Any other details?
First two numbers are 9 and 7.
You find out the others.
Sit down.
So.  You think I'll be killed.
Yes.  I believe they'll try.
The subversives or that other guy?
The other guy... Cres.
Ah, That's right....
The chemist.
He tried to kill his wife,
His plan was too naive.
What did he get?
5 years, upheld by you on appeal.
Not by me.
I meant by the court over which you presided.
So!
- He was innocent.
- Really?
I think he was.
Was he innocent,.. or do you just think he was?
I do think he was innocent, but I can't be sure.
I see...
You can't be sure about it.
Yes, I have a doubt.
I think it was an error, a judicial error.
Judicial errors don't exist.
- You're a practising Catholic?
- Pracising, no.
A Catholic nevertheless.
Sure, like everyone else.
I presume you go to mass from time to time.
Ever considered the issue of bread and wine,.. turning into the body and blood of Christ?
Each time...
Each time the priest eats that bread,.. and drinks that wine, the mystery is fulfilled
That must always happen.
It can never be otherwise.
The priest may be unworthy in thought or deed, but simply due to the status he holds,.. each time the mass is celebrated the mystery is fulfilled.
When a judge delivers the law,.. he is exactly like a priest officiating at mass.
A judge may have doubts he may question himself, even torment himself,. but at the very moment he delivers judgement,.. he can't harbour doubts. At that moment justice is done.
Always?
One priest celebrating mass had blood on his hands.
Because he had doubts.
That has never happened to me.
No judgement has ever left blood on my hands.
No conviction has ever left blood on my gown.
It's obviously a question of faith.
I don't think you've quite understood.
I'm not a Catholic.
Nor am I a Christian.
However, I've never had any of these weaknesses.
I've never believed in Voltaire's
"Tratado sobre la tolerancia" on tolerance and judicial error.
Virtue, pity, innocent victims of judicial errors....
What errors?
A judge who can freely kill with his sentences...Ba!
Voltaire was the first to sow doubt about the judicial system.
When a religion allows for people's doubt,.. that religion is dead.
That's why we had Sartre, 
Bertrand Russell, Marcuse... and the delirium of today's youth.
You mean Voltaire is to blame?
Yes.  But Voltaire had an excuse.
In his day they didn't realise the danger of those ideas... but today's mass culture has made that danger mortal.
If things go on like this, the only viable form of justice will be a form of punishment known in war as decimation.
The way I punish is to kill one soldier in ten.
Today there are no more individuals!
Today, there is no more individual responsibility!
Your job, my dear friend has become ridiculous.
It was fine in peace time, but now we're at war.
Robberies, kidnappings, sabotage...  This is war!
And as in war the answer is decimation.
One, two, three, four, five...
Out!
One, two, three, four, five...
Cres, convicted!
Cres has a .22 calibre rifle,.. and it is loaded with a bullet for you.
Keep going.  Back all the way.
Park down there.
Go on! Go on! Stop!
Who lives below Judge Riches?
- Mr Pattos..
- The shipping tycoon?
Yes.
Inspector.
Mr Pattos.
What are you doing here?
- Sorry, I didn't think...
- What did you not think?
That you'd meet me in my friend Pattos' place?
I didn't think I'd be intruding in a reunion of frieds.
Too late now.  So?
- I was looking for someone.
- Looking for me?
No, someone who just come in.
One of my guests?
Please come in.
Come with me.
The inspector was surely looking for me.
Are you here to arrest me?
My dear Evaristo, you are a big liar..
You always denied the police tapped our phones.
The inspector's presence here proves my case.
- Is this right?
- Not that I know of.
How amazing!
Did he expect to get any other answer?
I know nothing about phone tapping.
It is done sometimes,.. but always with prior judicial approval,.. and only criminal suspects are tapped.
It is never done for political reasons.  Never..
That means I'm a criminal suspect,.. because my phone is definately tapped.
In fact, it's not even my phone.
The phone belongs to my host, Norcio,
There,here's the great progressive writer.
No, No.  You're not my guest you're the guest of my wife.
I'd never take an arsehole like you into my house... a provincial intellectual like you!
They brag on about permanent revolution...
You wish the inspector had come here to arrest you.
Then you'd be a hero.
- Wilfredo, Don't be ridiculous!
- Shut your mouth!
What a reactionary remark
'Shut your mouth'.
Just because I'm your wife, because you're my husband!
No. Because you're a parrot, not a woman!
There's nothing can be done.  You're a typical communist, catholic, bourgeois.
Yes, for a long time, not to keep up with the latest fashion!
Now that we are winning, communists, catholics, the bourgeoisie,.. you're all queueing up to jump on the bandwagon! 
No my dear, I don't like it!
Including you and that arsehole who wanted revolution!
Hello,hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Mo more of these family quarrels.
We're here to enjoy ourselves.. to eat.
Champagne?
- a whisky ?
- No, thanks.
Have a drink, Rogas.
You're not on duty.
Your assignment here is over.
Come with me..
To them it's a game.
- A game?  I wouldn't say so..
- Yes, yes a game.
Including me, 
I'm playing the game too..
I'm like a umpire... delivering both protection and threats..
Don't let appearances fool you, Rogas.
Despite the confidence, they're still scared.
More scared than they've ever been.
When the party's over they'll flee in all directions.
No one will sleep in their beds tonight.
Who do they fear?
They think you coming here was part of a plot... and your sudden appearance was planned.
My dear Rogas, subversive groups like Calano's are useful to us.
And to our Communist Party friends.
Friends?
Your know what the situation is like.
My party, which has run the country for 30 years,.. will be forced to rule with the Communists.
Your own job would be easier,
Rogas if Mr Amar, that party's leader, was in my chair.
This ministry would work.
It'd be fun to see Mr Amar and his party grappling with these groups.
Yes, well. And what should we do?
Continue harassing these groups as much as you can.
Arests, controls, searches... but always with the approval of the judges.
Before they're all killed!
If you're here to arrest Galano?
At least give us back our minister!
Hang around, Rogas. We will continue our conversation.
Hot coffee and cold milk.
Waiter, a whisky.
Find out who they are and what they want from me.
How can I? 
We're always being watched.
If they find out, 
I'm finished.
I didn't tell you to do it inside.
Why not use your own lab?
You did it with the oil bosses.
Give me a cigarette.
Come on, give me one.
Thanks.
Placing a bug under the commissioner's arse.
I'm fucked!
And now, Minister, allow me to address a burning issue.
Ever since I left the house of the president of the Supreme Court,..
I have the feeling that I'm being followed by professionals.
By people specifically suited to that task.
As if trained in a state or private police corps.
If people in high places, deem it necessary,.. to give me protection,...
I can only be grateful, ... but I should point out that such surveillance,... which is very expensive with so many officers involved,... would be better directed at protecting the judges.
You'll never get out of here unless you confess first!
And that goes for everbody!
To the Security Minister
It's the tanks.
Their motors run all night.
The meeting's at the armoured division barracks.
Listen, this is him.
Take it easier with those judges...
Rewind, Rewind.
Play it again.
Those judges..
Take it easier with those judges...
Rogas is on our back.
He's smelt a rat.
Come on, once more.
Those judges
Take it easier, with those judges.
Rogas is on our back.
He's smelt a rat.
- Is that it?
- Isn't that enough?
- Is that you, Rogas?
- Yes, good evening, doctor.
Why did you visit Riches?
To warn him he's in danger.
So you're still insisting in chasing your lunatic.
The judge will be killed whether it's by my lunatic or your group.
The judge is well protected.
I know. Today I saw all the security forces at Riches'.
I even spotted your car.
It's a plot.
The chemist Cres killed his judges, and now they keep killing the others.
We come across so many plots, they prepare one a day.
We've managed to keep them in check so far.
But this time you've got to do something fast.
We must wait,..
We can't risk everything by behaving rashly..
You don't understand.
I'm not saying you pre-empt their counter-revolution,.. but just inform parliament or the press.
We can't alarm everyone.. because you have certain impressions.
What impressions?  I have proof.
They're all implicated.
If that's the case, it's no use discussing it any further.
You must see Amar.
Only the party secretary can decide.
Amar is like all the others.
In a room of the National Gallery... a groupe of visitors discovered two bodies.
The police have now identified the victims...
Mr Amar, the secretary of the Communist Party, and police inspector
Amerigo Rogas.
Both victims were probably shot with the same weapon, a gun which Inspector Rogas was still holding in his hand.
Here's the chief of police's interpretation
Inspector Rogas had just return from a very stressful mission... to find the judges killer,
When he returned to the capital he showed signs of mental imbalance.
As a result he was placed on leave.
He was seeing plots everywhere. and started looking for non-existent evidence.
Perhaps he thought even the secretary of the Communist Party... was part of some imaginary plot.
He killed him and then turned the gun on himself.
So it seems we've accepted their version.
Everything points to him being the killer.
I don't believe it, I knew Rogas well.
He was no lunatic. There was a plot.
They felt so confident, they went all the way.
And now they have invented the ultimate provocation.
A police inspector kills the party secretary.
Even if that's so, what do you want?
A civil war?
A confrontation?
No
But we won't be accomplices.
What accomplices?  What would we be if we took part in their game.
Incite the people in the square?
This is wh1at they want?
So people will never know the truth.
Truth is not always revolutionary.

"From Colligny in Antarctic France.
Lates news from Admiral Villegagnon.
The country is a barren desert
There are no houses nor any other amenities.
On the contrary.
The natives are barbarous savages, different from us, without any religion, or any knowledge or honesty or virtue, or what is right and unjust.
They are beasts with human faces.
To boot, our neighbors are Portuguese.
Unable to keep the country for themselves, they hardly tolerate our presence and hate us.
Therefore, I must show firmness and courage and I prepare my "family" for permanent work.
God's goodness will assist us in this enterprise.
We have set up camp on an island two leagues from the mainland to discourage any attempt to escape and to allow our troops to fulfill their task.
Wives will be admitted only with their husbands.
All opportunities of sin will thus be eliminated.
Even so, twenty-six mercenaries, tempted by their carnal lust, have conspired to kill me.
I have avoided any further danger by arming five of my servants.
We have arrested and imprisoned four of the principal mutineers
The others, scared, have hidden themselves.
On the following day,
I had one of them unchained so that he could plead his cause.
He broke loose and threw himself into the sea and was drowned."
Letter from Villegagnon to Calvin, dated 31st of March, 1557.
HOW TASTY WAS
MY LITTLE FRENCHMAN
Directed by
NELSON PEREIRA DOS SANTOS
"In Sâo Vicente lived the Portuguese, enemies of the French."
A Frenchman!
It will be a nice present for my uncle.
He hasn't tasted a Frenchman yet.
Let's take him to the Captain!
Your chief is our friend.
The Frenchman is a friend of our enemies.
You're christened.
You can't eat him.
My uncle is not christened.
He is our slave.
He will have to fight at our side until we get to Sâo Vicente.
This way! Beware!
Go see the Frenchman!
Wake up, Frenchie!
He is mine!
He is mine!
I am French!
French!... French!
He is French.
Say something!
Put the lamprey into scalding water, take its guts out...
Lay half a slice onto a bowl, spice it with oil.
Speak more!
He is French!
I think he is Portuguese.
I will kill him.
He is French.
He is mine!
That rabbit sure can run.
He is Portuguese.
He is French.
I am French!... French!
Speak!
Speak!
Let it rest for a while and take it to the fire...
Then lay a little bit of water, vinegar, and clove.
He is Portuguese.
He is mine!
You eat the other one.
I want to show him to the women.
"My Lord, if I must die a barbarous death... let it be at the hands of someone who knows you."
There comes Cunhambebe!
Our meal has walked to us.
Come and see what I brought you to eat.
Beautiful slave!
I want to die with my beard.
He doesn't weep like the other Portuguese.
You brought good slaves.
When do we start the war?
They are like tigers, naturally cruel... friends of War and enemies of peace."
Our sorcerers prophesied that we would capture a strong Portuguese.
There he is!
He is my slave.
At last I shall avenge my brother's death.
If he were French, he wouldn't kill Tupinambás.
The French have knives, hatchets, and combs, which they trade for wood and pepper.
He has nothing of the sort.
He is Portuguese, friend of the Tupiniquins, our enemies.
He'll die on the 8th moon.
"To the European friend, they deplore the bad luck of their ancestors who have not known such a virtuous people."
How good he is...
Our friend...
He comes from so far...
Just to see us...
How many dangers has he faced just to reach us!
Since our friend left, we have suffered much.
Many of us have died at the hands of our enemies.
How sad are our dead today!
They will not see the beautiful presents which our friend has brought us.
Among the dead,
Tapiruçu, my husband, claims for vengeance and suffers much.
Tapiruçu died by the fire of the Portuguese.
The prophecy of our sorcerers has come true since Cunhambebe has brought us a strong Portuguese to avenge Tapiruçu's death.
Damn Portuguese!
He says he is French.
He refuses to sleep with me.
I am sad.
That's enough!
At last you have come!
Here I am!
I brought you many trunks.
I want to see.
Later! We have time.
I am angry.
I want to see now.
Let me see your slave first.
Bring the Portuguese!
He says he is French?
I'll tell you if he is lying.
What did you bring me this time?
How many trunks?
Many... with cloth... combs, beads for your women, knives...
But this time I want much pepper and wood.
You mean you have come from so far just to get wood?
Where do you come from?
I was serving Villegagnon in Rio de Janeiro.
Please, tell these savages I am French.
I was forced to leave the fortress.
I was caught with some Portuguese.
Tell them I am French.
He is Portuguese all right.
Go and eat him!
You dog!
Swine!
Murderer!
Give it to me!
I have brought you a present.
Filthy dog!
Traitor!
That's no way to treat a Christian!
Let me explain.
They will eat me up!
Quiet! Those savages aren't easy to cope with.
All right!
They will kill you, but you have still eight months to live.
Until you die, you'll be very happy.
You may even escape.
Follow my advice.
That woman at your side is your wife.
It won't be difficult to be happy with her.
Meanwhile collect peppers and wood for me.
When I come back in a few months, we'll make a deal.
I'll take you along.
I'll give you money to start a new life.
"The French took with them every year thousands of quintals of Brazil wood."
Where...
...did you find... these beads?
Tapiruçu stole them from the Portuguese.
How many?
Won't you go look for wood?
The sun's up.
My husband Tapiruçu might get sore.
Let him rest in peace!
He can't see nothing.
Come! Let's go look for wood!
No! Today I want to stay... home.
Tell me about Mair...
...the great "caraiba"...
...your ancestor.
The one who taught us how to build a fire?
What else?
He taught the Tupinambás how to shave, how to make weapons to beat the enemy, to plant manioc and corn, to drink "cauim."
He taught us how to build houses.
We lived like animals.
He built a house and told us every family could have the same.
The house that the new God had built was stronger than our miserable huts.
Not a single drop of rain fell inside...
Where there were straw roofs and log walls, the new God built a small village with brick and stone-walled houses, with streets and squares, barracks for the warriors, and a castle for the council of chiefs.
The Tupinambás cannot forget their enemies till their very last day.
Tupiniquins enemies...
Portuguese enemies...
The men were jealous of the God and decided to kill him.
They forced him to jump through a fire.
He fell and was burned alive.
From his head came out thunders and tempests...
My husband!
Then he taught us how to cultivate the land to have big crops.
He worked alone with the women and the children since the men were busy hunting, fishing, and preparing for war.
Your old customs...
Look at the Portuguese!
He goes around only with women.
They will be my slaves, like you.
Once more!
The Portuguese!
Stop there, Portuguese!
I want gunpowder.
I've brought many boxes...
...axes, beads...
...and combs for your wives.
I want gunpowder... plenty of gunpowder.
I'll get it later on...
...from father.
He's on board a ship sailing from Rio.
I'm going to exchange my gifts with another one.
Let's make a deal.
As I see, you want beads.
But you're not allowed to come along this time.
I've tried to rescue you, but
Cunhambebe is not prepared.
You'd better wait a little while.
My goods may interest you.
In exchange for what?
Your flight?
It's impossible.
I want gunpowder.
Impossible.
Ten barrels, at worst.
Listen, no French captain...
...not even Sir Villegagnon will ever give gunpowder...
...to these barbarians.
It would be nonsense.
It's for me.
Don't you understand you can't have a thing of your own?
All you have belongs to Cunhambebe.
No trade with you.
Is it worth that much?
Look at her belly button.
Not bad!
The coin.
Let's bargain honestly.
Don't think you can run away.
The captain wants to leave at once.
A rival of mine.
Give me that.
It's mine, I found it!
Half and half.
No. We've made a deal.
Where are you going?
Come back.
Come on!
Let's see the big ship.
Come along.
You'll see...
...some nice things...
...my cousin gets...
...on board.
Come on!
Don't be afraid.
We'll be right back.
I want you to stay...
...by my side.
You are going to see...
...things you never saw.
There will be many beads for you...
Nobody owns such a stuff.
Only my cousin.
They'll come back.
I'm not sad.
What do you need all these necklaces for?
And all these combs?
The Frenchmen promised to bring me gunpowder...
...as well as necklaces, combs, and mirrors for you.
Will you be able to kill more Portuguese...
...and Tupiniquins with mirrors?
I've killed many of them...
...and I'll do even more with guns.
Our enemy is afraid.
Our brothers have been killed by Portuguese gunmen.
I want a revenge of my own.
A Tupinambá is valiant...
...and never forgives his enemy.
Like me!
You are going to die like an animal.
Wait! I can get some gunpowder.
I'll make some gunpowder with the help of Tupâ.
I'll make it out of sand and pepper...
...this evening...
...when Tupâ, the thunder God, will speak.
And tomorrow...
...tomorrow you'll have the gunpowder.
"They believe in the immortality of the soul, in thunder and devils.
It seems that this seed of religion grows
...and is not extinguished in them... despite the shadows in which they live."
So little?
Tupâ has spoken too much.
There should be more gunpowder.
I'll make more.
Is there any feast in the settlement?
The chiefs are praying for rain.
Go on, till Tupâ speaks.
Go on, don't stop!
I'll build my house near yours.
My uncle is waiting for me.
I'm going to visit him, but I'll be back to make some gunpowder...
...and to live here as a friend.
I'll leave on the first ship that arrives here.
First, you have to fight beside me.
It's time to attack our enemies.
You work the guns.
We'll attack the Tupiniquins with all our might.
I'll send for my relatives...
...all over around.
Weapons and flour are ready.
Only helpful dreams...
...are missing.
Try to dream of our enemies' burnt flesh...
...and ask the chief and your wife for advice.
We shall win!
"The natives believe that the soul...
...of those who conquered their enemies...
...will go to pleasent places."
Chief!
Our ancestors agree.
We want to revenge the outrage of our enemies.
There they are.
We're going to kill and capture a large quantity of them.
I dreamt of my father looking for me.
Following the war?
Yes, after helping Cunhambebe to defeat his enemies.
But I came back.
We shall win!
The sea will watch the end of the Tupiniquins.
Cunhambebe will know how to beat them!
"In this country no
Governor, no Bishop...
...or other authority could please God, Our Lord...
...for evil is much impregnated in the customs."
Father Nóbrega - Missionary
My slave is ready.
We'll eat him this moon.
And I'll get a further name.
My cousin Ipiraguaçu will receive this arm.
That one to Mbitatá.
The neck belongs to Seboipebe.
Are you going to die as a brave... or will you weep like the Portuguese?
Why did you come here?
I came to make gunpowder... for my master.
It will not rain before the feast.
Tupâ does not need the rain to speak.
Are you going to weep?
What about you?
Yes, I'll feel unhappy.
But then you'll eat me.
What must I do during the feast?
Show yourself a brave.
You have to run...
...and then all of us shall run after you.
Run quickly... as a warrior does.
You can't escape...
...but you'll be respected.
You'll be led back...
...and the women will paint your head.
You have to dance for a while tied to a rope.
Cunhambebe will bring the "iverapema".
You'll be allowed to throw fruits and stones...
...on those who are going to eat you.
Then Cunhambebe will say:
"I'm here to kill you."
"Because your people... have killed...
...many of ours."
You must answer:
"When I die...
...my friends will come...
...to avenge me."
Say it again!
My friends will come to avenge me.
No... "When I die..."
"...my friends will come to avenge me."
When I die, my friend will come to avenge me.
Then Cunhambebe will lift the "iverapema"... and you must do like that... like that.
But it can't help...
...because two warriors will be holding the rope.
It will beat you just upon your head.
And then?
Women will pour hot water on your body...
...both your arms and legs...
...will be cut... and everybody will eat a piece.
My little neck!
My little neck!
Leech!
My little neck!
What a delicious meat!
I am here to kill you...
...because your people have killed...
...many of ours...
...and eaten them.
Talk!
"When I die...
...my friends will come... to avenge me.
No one of yours... will remain upon this land."
"I fought on the sea, so that no
Tupiniquin remained alive.
Laid along the shore...
...the dead covered almost a league."
Mem de Sá. Governor
General of Brazil, 1557.

While tattooing...
You have to press the skin tightly with your thumb.
In the process of engraving colour get's underneath the skin.
The noise that this creates is called ''Sound of the distance''.
It's beautiful when you got used to it,
But those who don't know it usually shudder.
"Shuddering" ...
Because of the tattoo colour you easily feel cold in winter.
Therefore you have to wear warm clothes.
This doesn't mean it's more comfortable in summer though.
Wearing a tattoo means to train patience your whole life long.
She was one of the most wonderful creatures I've ever seen.
I never touched a skin as smooth as hers.
If you spend your life tattooing, you get addicted to skin.
She was perfect.
A woman that stirred your blood.
Her face must have been beautiful either, but ...
Did she cover her face?
Yes.
She stood over there ... graceful
She wanted me to tattoo her with something that would scare others simply away. Stun them
Hearts should stop beating when they saw it... or something that should men totally loose control.
She let me touch her everywhere ...
Her back, her wonderful ... breasts.
I did the mountain-witch on her back
On her breast I tattooed Kintaro, the witch's child, catching her breast
It's almost impossible to stand the pain tattooing nipples and belly.
It is the worst torture imaginable.
But she was brave.
Didn't make any noise. No tears.
I had a suspicion.
First I thought she'd be a dancer
But that was wrong.
She had to be a fighter.
I heard the Lords have female warriors: the Besshikime.
The way she looked and acted seemed very much like a Besshikime.
Probably that's why she had to cover her face.
But why does a Besshikime want a tattoo of a witch and her child covering her body
What could be the reason?
In fact it was my masterpiece, but
I sometimes question myself if... it brings misfortune.
Who are you? who is he?
Who is he? Who are you?
Are you the god of wealthiness?
Who sits besides him?
- the one with the long head!
Who are you? The god of welfare and health?
And the Master besides you?
The one with the big belly?
The god of cheerfullness.
And the one right besides?
Who is the one with the running nose??
Must be the god of a long life ...
Happy new year!
Children, go home!
It's all over, go!
Daigoro?
Daigoro?
Oh, where are you going, Myladies?
Oh? He, little boy.
We're going home.
It's all over now and soon it'll be dark.
Better return home before!
- before monsters catch you.
Wandering monks
Dad.
Rain keeps falling. like a long wet courtain.
It's cold. Cold and sad.
The wind blows in the heart of the little boy.
Waiting for his father, who won't return.
His father is supposed to be an Assassin
The little boy knew that his father sometimes spent the nights in abandoned temples.
He knew, his father kneed before the statue of Buddha after his work was done.
He didn't know why. Did he go there to talk with his mother who lived in the other world now?
To cure his heart from the pain?
He was looking for his father
These eyes
A fighter living on the edge. of life and death.
Only those who fought their battles know this look
How can such a young boy posess the look?
Has my eyes turned blunt?
Attention! Pay attention on the direction of the wind! - Yes.
For the next harvest.
- Yes.
Let's burn the field!
He'll be surrounded by fire.
I can't stand it!
But it is for sure a good opportunity to test him.
I was right.
Despite the fire he doesn't cry for help.
Still a child ... but determined to live ...
What an amazing child ...
Come on over!
What's up?
A child? - It was surrounded by the fire. We have to help him.
Hold on!
Is he hurt? - He hid in the mud, so the fire didn't hurt him.
We'll have to hurry, otherwise ...
He saved himself?
Yes, he was lucky.
You didn't cry for help because, you thought you were saved.
That's why you weren't scared?!
Drop him!
What are you doing. Why do you raise your sword against a child?
His eyes ...
It's Shishogan the look of a Fighter, who killed hundreds, but did survive...
I can't explain it ...
Impossible ...
Even the sword doesn't scare him.
Everybody who choses the way of a fighter is longing... to be like him
On the edge between life and death.
- What are you doing? l'll have to be sure.
- How ...?
Fight!
- What?!
Away!
Or I'll kill you too!
Suio-Style, Ross-technique!!
Are you the child of the lone wolf?
Dad. ltto Ogami ...
Dad.
Gunbei Yagyu.
You're still alive.
I defeated you.
The Yagyu-Shinkage-Style defeated the Suio-Style.
Nevertheless you had been chosen as the official Kaishakunin.
Those days ...
The Tokugawa-Shogunat controlled their Lords through a merciless Policy.
The Kaishakunin were those who beheaded the Lords, who were ordered to commit
Seppuku.
The Kaishakunin was allowed to wear the colours of the Shogunat.
This is how the Shogunat gave him the power, to behead lords in the name of the Shogunate
Fool!
Get Gunbei!
The honor and future of the house of Yagyu is in danger.
Fool! ltto Ogami will be Kaishakunin of the Shogunate.
Unbelievable! - How could you raise your sword against the
Shogun. And Itto moved between you and him, showing he'd risk his life for the sake of the Shogunate.
At least it looked like that, but ltto had had no Chance to dogde my strike. That's how it happened.
You idiot!
Even if it wasn't Itto's intention, at least it looked, as if he had protected the Shogun
Shogun from your blade.
Get up, Gunbei!
Gunbei!
Thanks to your skills I'll let you live.
But from now on you'll be known to be a dead man.
People will think you committed
Seppuku.
You'll change your looks and you will go to the north.
Call Goroza, the one who can change faces from the  Kurokuwa-Clan. - Yes.
I'm here.
Goroza.
Since you know Gunbei, it'll be easy to recreate his face.
One moment.
What you have to do now is for the sake of the Yagyu-Clan.
Are you ready to die for us?
- I am.
You'll have to slit open your belly.
I, Retsudo, will assist you.
It shall be done.
Forgive me ...
Officiually the Yagyu-art of fighting is inferior to the art of fighting of Itto Ogami.
From now on Itto Ogami, as the
Kaishakunin of the Shogun, will wear the colours of the Shogunate.
The more than 60 Lords of our country will tremble with respect.
His fame as a master of the sword will grow.
The Yagyu Clan will always be measured by his deeds.
Using the false Gunbei we'll at least be able to... restore a part... of our honour, but it'll never be the same again.
We must prepare a trap for Itto
Ogami. Making him look like he's acting unloyal against the Shogunate.
We will destroy his house and his name.
And we will get the position of
Kaishakunin back for our family.
Had I killed you when I had the chance to, my brothers wouldn't have had to die ... l will take revenge, ltto Ogami.
And glory will return to the name of Yagyu.
If I kill you now it'll be over.
Can you defeat me?
Kill me!
Why don't you kil me?
- You are already dead.
Makes no sense to kill the dead. l speak to Amida-Buddha.
We, father and son, walk the ways of darkness.
We even kill our own parents. even Buddha, when we meet him.
Dad.
Once there was a group of people, they were Goumes,artists living on the streets, not beggars.
Like street-musicians,
No-dancer, comedians, actors and storytellers.
They belonged to the Jindayu 
Gomune organization,
They were spread throughout the country and had a special status.
Who are you?
I'd like to speak to
Master Jindayu Gomune. l am ltto Ogami and this is my only son Daigoro.
I won't let a hired Assassin kill
Oyuki.
Kill him!
You are not my enemies.
Dad.
A scary little boy.
Quiet! You treat your guests in a disrespectful manner.
Yes. l don't know, who's there, but I am Jindayu Gomune. l am ltto Ogami and I came here for some questions.
Come in.
- But Master ...
Let him in!
- Yes.
You're trying to find Oyuki to kill her?
What else could an Assassin want to do.
Poor girl to have a skilled figter like you behind her.
Did the Owari-Klan hire you?
Forgive me...
Foolish to ask an Assassin a question like that.
Oyuki was one of us.
- as you already suspected.
She was trained as a swordfighter from the time when she was a little girl. 
Lord Owari, who was travelling incognito discovered her because of her fighting skills.
So he made Oyuki. his Besshikime to train his people the art of swordfighting
As a leader of the Gomune,
I can't tell you more.
Whatever happened to her and why she got tattooed and started being an Assassin, I don't know..
None of my businesses
Sure, I heard some rumors, but I never tried to find out more...
And if I knew I probably wouldn't tell you.
As you also supected, she isn't a Gomune any more.
On the road to Kiso, close to Akasaka, there is a thermal bath named
''Tsuta no Yu''.
It is known that it fulfills your dreams and desires if you go there, pray to the god of bathing and spend 7 days and nigts there, doing the neccessary rituals.
If you have a wish, you might consider going there.
Thank you. l'll have to go now.
Master Ogami.
Oyuki is my daughter.
At the end of this ascent you'll find ''Tsuta no Yu''.
It's a lonely place.
At this time of the year there's nobody there.
You challenge me? It's ridiculous.
- Shut up! l'll expose your deceitful style.
Where are you looking at?
Look into the fire, and you'll loose.
Don't look into the fire! 
Concentrate or you'll loose.
Don't fall for my delusion!
Look me in the eyes!
Don't look in the fire!
Look me in the eyes and fight!
The eyes, look me in the eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
The eyes! Look in the eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
Why should such a beauty become a Besshikime?
Women who seek for the arts of war are the ugly ones, unable to get a man.
You regained consciousness, but it's too late.
Bite off your tung after I'm through with you.
Daigoro.
He has no mother, please be kind to him. l beg you, kill
Oyuki!
Forgive me, but those who come here seek for their desires to be fulfilled.
Is that what you're here for?
To kill me, that is your desire.
Yuki, the expelled! ln the name of the lord you'll die.
Get ready!
- Kill her!
I've already heard you being after me.
I know your name. You are the lone wolf with cub.
Tell me. Why do you cut off the knots from the samurais you killed?
I got expelled from the Owari-Clan.
So it's natural that the head of the Owari wants me to get killed.
If I cut of the knots of my persecutors and send them back,
Enki Kozuka, whom I wish to kill will be sent after me one day.
That is the reason.
Then I ask you: The Families of these Samurais were dishonoured by what you did to them.
Many committed suicide.
How will you ever stand the hate you evoke? The only reason for all their pain and suffering is your revenge against one man.
And I am here to seek revenge for their suffering ...
I met your father, Jindayu Gomune.
He told me you were his daughter.
My father ...
My father wants me to die, doesn't he ...?
Sometimes I think there can be... no greater luck for a child than parents... whose desire is it's death.
Oyuki.
Finally you have come, Enki Kozuka.
You have become even more beautiful.
This costume fits better to the Gomune-people.
You need help?
I won't need help to kill you, scum!
It's different from last time.
This time you'll have to die.
Where are you looking at? l teached you not to look in the fire.
The eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
Eyes ...
Look in the eyes ... ln my eyes ...
Look me in the eyes!
The eyes!
Look me in the eyes!
So that I can die without showing my skin,
I'm happy then. l'll make sure nobody will see your skin.
I'm grateful that you come to.. bring me the urn!
One question ...
I hope her death wasn't disgraceful?
She died full from grace.
It's about time ...
One moment ...
Could you, who were here when she died stay here for a while, to calm down her soul?
Call it an act of providence and tell me from my daughter's last hours
So you are telling me, he killed
Oyuki andd Enki?
My people saw it with their very own eyes.
So the rumors are true.
That's not a matter of the
Shogunate any more, it's a question of honour.
Not only has he violated your territory, He's seeking lodging with these ordinary Gomunes.
That is proof enough.
If you won't react, you'll make a fool out of yourselves.
I can't let him go!
Bastard!
Lord! The Samurai of the
Owari-Clan attack us.
What are you doing? We won't let you through! - Shoot!
Here, here is he!
Back. Stand still!
Are you Jindayu Gomune?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
It is said the assassin, the lone wolf with cub, hides here.
Hand him over and nothing will happen to you.
Otherwise we have orders to kill you all.
I refuse!
- Are you crazy?
Don't you care for yourself any more?
It's about time for us to go.
- Don't go, Master Ogami!
Master Jindayu,
I came of my free will, so let me go of my free will.
- You can't.
Will you resist?
Master Ogami is my guest.
What would you do if we asked you to hand us over a guest of,
Lord Fürsten Owari?
Don't get impudent, scum!
Who do you think you are?
- Let me tell you something!
Lord Owaris property is around 619.000 Koku. he has 4.000 men serving him. ln comparison there are... more than 20.000 Gomune-people, who serve me.
This is not about strength and power...
It's about respect.
If Lord Owari is human, we are too...
As well as him we eat the rice, and shit it out.
We take hospitality for granted.
And we can't hand you over a guest even when you threaten us.
We Gomunes have pride as well.
Scum!
Keep calm!
- Master!
Damned, you ...!
- finish them!
Keep cool! Do not attack!
Master Jindayu!
Master Ogami ...
Take my head and hand it over to Lord Owari.
Tell Lord Owari her father payed you to kill
Oyuki.
Me, Oyukis father has killed, his fallen daughter, in in his name.
As her father I ask for his forgiveness with my death.
Master Jindayu.
The father's heart is like the heart of his child.
Oyuki ...
As if Oyuki ...
... were calling me. hurry. I have to ...
... come to her ...
Master!
Master!
- Master!
Guide me to Lord Owari!
Take a bow! Hold on! l speak to Lord Owari. l am no prisoner, I am here of my own free will.
What?
Enki Kozuka is the one responsible for all that happened.
Oyuki left your clan, because was terribly harmed by him.
She got rid of the disgrace by killing Enki.
I have come to tell you this.
You are ridiculous!
Who do you think are you talking to?
Jindayu Gomune isn't connected in any way to the Owari-Clan.
To kill him is inexcusable.
You are irrevent! l am Yoshinao from the
Tokugawa-Family. You know where you are?
Me and my son, walk the way of hell.
Neither do we care for the Tokugawa, nor do we care for the Shogunate.
Kill them!
Kill these fools!
Daigoro!
Your life is in my hands.
Don't move!
Don't dare to move or your
Lord's life and all your wealth will vanish. are you gonna take the responsibilities?
Listen, Master Kashiwagi.
Until we left this castle,
Lord Owari will be our hostage.
Stand up!
Step forward!
You scum!
Don't do anything you'd regret lateron!
Master Ogami, wait!
One moment!
Please wait!
Master Ogami, let me accompany you. l refuse!
The please spare the life of our Master.
I won't do himno harm.
Come, hurry!
Lord!
Lord Owari, take cover!
Stop, don't shoot!
- Lord!
Daigoro, listen carefully!
Your father walks the way of hell.
If I won't return, you'll have to die here too.
You understand?
Attack him!
- Yes.
Retsudo, fight!
Take that! ltto Ogami, take this strike from the Yagyu-Clans!
Dad?
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad!
Daigoro, pull the sword out of my back! ltto Ogami, you survived the fight quite well.
No matter what will happen, you must survive.
Neither the Yagyu nor the Kurokuwa...
I will defeat you.
One day I will send you to hell
Until then ...

NORTH MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE
The oath.
Take no bribes.
Don't abuse your authority.
Hate the crime, not the criminal.
Remember your sphere of activities and your duties.
Do not compromise authority.
Those who break this oath will be punished by the gods.
I, Magobei Onishi, chief officer, swear this oath.
- I swear this oath.
- I swear this oath.
Next, Officer Hanzo Itami.
Hanzo.
Don't you hear me?
I do.
I know this is only a formality, but I can't betray myself and seal the oath in blood.
Please go on.
You.
You say our oath is only a formality?
An insult!
Inexcusable!
You say you can't swear the oath if you have to betray yourself-
That means you abuse your authority and take bribes.
Absolutely not.
But this office receives gifts from the retainers of the daimyo who hope to avoid trouble with us.
This is a fact.
It's also a fact that the brothels and tradesmen send gifts.
I'm a member of this office, and although I do not receive any of the actual money,
I may be under obligation in some way.
So I refuse the oath.
What is a bribe, Officer Onishi?
Being lenient for a sum?
Because of bribery, we've become too lenient.
We overlook violent samurai.
We shut our eyes to what goes on in the Yoshiwara brothels.
We don't arrest many tradesmen either.
Watch your mouth, Hanzo.
Don't argue.
Talking back to your superior?
Insolence!
Simmer down and listen!
Our duty's not to protect the samurai, the rich, or Yoshiwara.
We should protect the millions of Edo townsmen and farmers.
Put that in writing before making us take an oath.
Then I'll seal it with the blood of my entrails.
- You!
- Hanzo, you're -
Calm down.
Hanzo Itami.
How many years have you been an officer?
Four years.
You've never taken this oath?
The first year he was sick.
The next year he was on duty.
The third year he was sick again.
And this year he finally shows up and does this.
I am sorry.
Up to something?
If you've got anything to say, out with it.
We keep peace and order in Edo.
But there are too many things to block us.
Starting with the retainers, the temple,
and the finance magistrates,
they all say they're not under our jurisdiction,
and won't let us investigate.
Innumerable suspects escape us
because of it.
It's impossible to keep law and order.
The matter urgently needs correcting rather than stupid oaths.
To justify this corruption with an oath is a rather foolish act.
It's like asking us to abandon our jobs as officers of the law.
I admit it's a regrettable thing.
But that's the government's problem.
We can do nothing about it.
Be reasonable.
No, sir.
I cannot set my blood seal to such an oath.
Please permit me to carry out my duties as a real lawman.
Please take my request into consideration.
HANZO THE RAZOR: SWORD OFJ USTICE
Put it on.
- Master.
- Are you all right?
Put more on.
But -
I said put more on.
Hurry.
Take your hands away... fools.
Master!
Put it on.
- It'll break your bones!
- Please stop!
Never mind. One more.
Devil-fire.
Viper.
Roll up the sleeve on your left arm.
Again?
Just do what I say and tell me what you used to be.
Tell me.
- I was a thief.
- That's right. And you?
Let me off, Master.
So you're not going to say it?
I kidnapped girls to sell them.
Who made it possible for you to walk the streets as free men?
Our lives are yours.
That's clear.
Do as I say then.
Put it on.
Master.
Master.
I'm not done yet.
Hanzo.
Are you out of your mind?
On your rounds?
What's the idea?
As you can see,
I'm torturing myself.
Stop it.
Take them off.
- Don't touch them.
- Hanzo, you -
A member of the magistrate's office undergoing torture!
What's the meaning of this?
I didn't think I'd hear those words from you, Chief.
What?
We're filthy lawmen who handle criminals.
That's why we can't even meet the Shogun.
So I don't see anything wrong... in testing myself by torture.
Testing?
Chief Onishi.
We ourselves should know the pains of the criminals we torture.
After people are tortured beyond the limit of human endurance, they enter a sort of world like Shangri-La.
So we must find the limit that's most effective in torturing men.
Take them off.
Hurry!
How did you get these scars?
I hung upside down and went through the water and basket tortures.
I was lashed, stripped naked, and underwent severe torture.
It seems to erect when in pain like when it's all tired out.
We're too busy for these things.
Hanzo, we're going to round up vagrants today.
You'll go too.
I'm an officer.
That's not my job.
Don't complain.
We don't have enough men.
Everybody takes part in today's roundup.
- I refuse.
- What?
Think you can get away with refusing your superior?
It'll be December soon.
You don't mind being fired next year?
Always bragging of your position.
Why don't you look me in the face when you talk?
Fire me if you can!
Onishi, do you know what your nickname is?
It's Snake Magobei, idiot!
That's no way to talk to your chief.
We can't continue to work unless we get your consent at the year's end.
Taking advantage of it, you force us to give you gifts and line your own pockets.
We fawn on you so you won't hate us.
You're Snake Magobei!
I let you talk and...
Want to?
I'm telling you our duties.
Rounding up vagrants isn't really our work.
Plus, we're off-duty.
It doesn't make sense!
You forget your position.
I'll settle this once and for all.
I don't understand.
Why get worked up about vagrants?
Something's behind it.
If we don't keep Onishi under control, we'll end up getting the ax.
Check on him.
Watch him around the clock.
Report everything.
- We'll do that.
- If I'm fired, so are you.
We know.
All men, high or low, have a skeleton or two in their closet.

Stop!
Don't resist!
Damn it! I won't give in!
Out of my way!
Serves you right, assholes.
Move aside!
Help me, master!
I don't want to be sent to Tsukuda Island!
Spare me.
I've got hot news.
Kanbei escaped from his island.
Your name?
I'm Sanji.
He's dead.
Well?
His nose is crushed, but he'll be fine in a month.
You're cruel to break my nose.
What if I become ugly?
It'll heal soon.
Now you'll look tougher.
Or is being sent up for four years better than being in pain for a month?
No, of course not.
I'm indebted to you.
What about Kanbei?
Tell me the rest.
Last year-
It's about Killer Kanbei caught last year and banished to an island.
I found it.
Kanbei Harada also known as Killer Kanbei, 42.
He contracted killings for money?
Yes, a former Bizen Clan samurai, he uses the Batto style of swordplay.
He ran a school in Shitaya and had five or six pupils.
As a suspect, he was tortured in every way but didn't confess.
- Quiet.
- I'm sorry.
Incorrigible.
They couldn't get proof, so they banished him for blackmail.
Even though there is no proof or confession, there must be a reason why people call him Killer Kanbei.
There must've been another way to interrogate him.
Yet they didn't execute him but banished him in a hurry.
Something's not right.
The officers?
Officer Aizawa caught him.
Chief Onishi handled the case.
Onishi?
I have a friend named He... Hed...
Hide.
He said he saw Kanbei a few days ago.
What?
Hide's a pick- a pickpocket.
He used to live near his fencing school, so he recognized him.
By the way he limped, he's sure it was Kanbei.
Did he say who the woman was or what her name was?
You know what?
She has no hair where she should.
All smooth.
Smooth?
What did you just say?
A beautiful woman with no hair there, all white.
Sorry.
Except that, Hide didn't find out her name or who she is.
No good would come of being found out and getting killed by Kanbei.
Master.
Onishi has a mistress.
He sees her secretly.
She's irresistible.
I want to do her too.
Onishi, the lucky dog!
She has no hair there.
What?
Not a single hair.
It's her. No mistake.
She's my trump card.
Get the woman.
How awful!
Submit to the law!
Not me.
When I came home, he was already dead.
We got a report someone screamed here!
No. I didn't do it.
Explain at the office.
Come on.
No. What are you doing?
Let me go.
Where are you taking me?
That's the way to the river.
- You'll be questioned there.
- What?
We've got a special technique to make you confess.
What?
Here comes the police boat.
What are you doing?
Damn it! Stop it!
You call yourselves officers of the law?
What are you doing to me?
What are you doing?
Damn it.
What do you intend to do with me?
A few questions.
Don't you know who I am?
I have many friends.
You'll pay for this.
An officer. You'll be fired.
I know you're Onishi's kept woman.
What're you -
Shall I walk you home?
Or should you walk me home?
At least we can walk together
To the corner of the street
No. Don't stop.
You're so virile.
Omino, you're Kanbei's woman, aren't you?
I don't know -
I don't know anyone by that name.
You mean you aren't?
Don't. Don't stop.
How about it?
I was, a long time ago.
You still are.
Somebody saw you together.
No.
What's wrong? Please.
Please kill me.
He was banished to Hachijo Island.
Why is he back?
No boats have gone to release anybody for three years, and there are no reports that a criminal's escaped.
And Kanbei's woman is
Onishi's mistress now.
What's going on?
Please.
I beg you to.
Confess.
And you'll be in heaven.
Kanbei -
Kanbei wasn't banished at all.
Hurry.
I'll tell all.
Tell me everything.
Nothing to hide.
We're both naked.
I have a lot of enemies, so I have these.
Have to be pretty smart to leave here in one piece.
And I have three men guarding the place, so don't worry.
Confess everything.
You're in my charge.
This makes it easier to talk?
Right after Kanbei was caught...
What's this?
A living doll and 500 gold pieces.
Not a bad deal.
Spare Killer Kanbei, the man you arrested.
What's that?
We need Kanbei.
Please make an exception for him.
I can't do that.
We've been after him for a year.
You refuse?
But I'm an officer, and to break the law -
Kofu is very cold in winter, isn't it?
Since you're such a conscientious officer, you won't mind being transferred there, will you?
Wait.
Are you sure they threatened to send him to Kofu?
No idea who they are?
Both their faces were hidden and it was so sudden.
They ordered me to cooperate in saving the man I loved.
You were taken to Onishi's place?
One was a middle-aged man, the other a woman.
And four or five masterless samurai.
Chief Onishi's an officer of the North Magistrate's Office.
No ordinary person can send him to Kofu.
You're in charge of rounding up vagrants.
Pick a man resembling Kanbei.
Give him money and make him agree to serve a couple of years.
Send him to Hachijo Island.
That should be easy for you to do.
Substitute the man for Kanbei while you conduct an investigation.
To request such a thing from an officer of the law takes a great deal of determination.
So if you refuse -
I haven't said that.
You agree then?
Don't worry, even if you are found out.
We can pressure the magistrate, even the elders, and hush it up.
He said he could even pressure men like that?
Someone in the Inner Castle.
Omino.
Did she talk like a lady-in-waiting?
Now that you mention it...
I meant to get Onishi, but I'm onto something monstrous.
What do they have to do with Kanbei?
Something big's behind this.
I'll hand you over to Onishi.
What?
A man was found dead in your home.
I'll hand you over as the suspect.
That's -
We're up against the elders or the inner castle.
It's all or nothing now.
It'll be the biggest match of Razor Hanzo's life.
Omino was arrested.
They found a dead man in her home, so...
Something's fishy.
The officers?
Devil-fire Seikichi and
Viper Genju are on the case.
So that means -
Razor Hanzo?
If he's involved,
I guess the corpse was planted there as an excuse to arrest her.
Razor Hanzo?
I don't know what he's found out, but we must get rid of him before things get serious.
- Officer Yamawaki's arrived.
- All right.
Thanks for coming.
What is it so early in the day?
Off duty?
- So I'm sleepy.
- Sorry.
A few questions.
Yamawaki.
You know all about the Inner Castle, since you're in charge of food there.
What's it to you?
I'm not free to talk.
Don't say that.
We're childhood chums.
What woman there... can move the magistrate or an elder?
And have the chief officer sent to Kofu?
Lady Oraku, I think.
Not only is she the mother of Lord Nishinomaru, but she's a great favorite of the Shogun.
Who can work on her and get her to take such an action?
What're you up to, Hanzo?
Don't worry about it.
It doesn't concern you.
Just answer me.
There's no such person.
Is there?
No one has that much power, but there's someone she especially favors.
Lady Oraku just might listen to what that person says.
Who is it?
Oyura and her father,
Dr. Genpaku Inamura.
Once every three days, she sees
Lady Oraku and acts as her companion.
Only a doctor's daughter?
Don't get the wrong idea about her.
Unlike old ladies-in-waiting,
Lady Oraku has no lesbian tendencies.
Genpaku and Oyura?
There were strange rumors about her a year ago.
A year ago?
Iga spies guarding the inner castle tried to kidnap her but they disappeared instead.
They were probably killed.
If her bodyguard killed them, he must be even stronger than Iga spies.
But why would someone like that be guarding Oyura?
Just rumors, I presume.
No, they're not just rumors.
Lady Oraku took care... that they'd only seem to be rumors.
Who are you?
What're you doing?
Master.
Kanbei killed the Iga spies.
No mistake.
Stay out of it, Yamawaki.
Devil-fire.
Viper.
Kanbei's found out.
Smart to come disguised as firefighters.
NORTH MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE
Hey, isn't that Razor Hanzo?
Yes. He's very strong, and so is his thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under his loincloth.
Stop it!
That hanging part of his body?
The vulnerable spot?
- You mean his balls?
- What are you saying?
- The other thing!
- Imagining things. Pig!
You're awful!
- Your face is awful!
- Like yours!
- You're one to talk!
- Anyway, is it that big?
A size larger with big warts.
He's more than a widow-killer, a courtesan-killer.
- Ever seen it?
- Yes, with Kihachi.
I saw him in the summer washing himself in a tub and -
What?
Counting prayer beads?
I know!
Omino killed Minokichi.
Wanted as a vagrant, he ran into her house and stole money.
Then he tried to assault her but was killed by Omino instead.
Minokichi's body?
- I cremated him after the inspection.
- Fast work.
Arrest papers, please.
Did Omino confess?
She seems deathly afraid and won't talk.
I'll make her confess at Denmacho jail.
Is it really safe?
Don't get upset.
Just do as I say.
Master.
Hanzo?
He's searching for something.
Master, save me!
I didn't do anything.
There was a body when I came home.
- You say anything?
- I wouldn't dare say a word to him.
I've been falsely accused.
Hurry. Save me.
You really didn't talk?
I thought you'd come to rescue me, so I held out.
- I see.
- Master.
I will save you, so do as I tell you.
You'll be taken to Denmacho.
I'll have you tied loosely.
So jump into the river from the bridge.
I can't.
Don't worry.
Kanbei will save you in a boat.
It's all I can do for you.
Understand?
I can't swim.
Don't worry.
Kanbei will be there.
Master.
You'll come with me, won't you?
Yes, I will.
Officer Onishi.
You're going along with her?
Yes. I have to see the magistrate.
I see.
It hurts. Wait a minute.
Wait.
Let her rest a while.
She's escaping.
Follow her.
Hurry, fools.
Don't let her escape.
She can't swim.
It must be cold in the river.
- Did you kill her?
- You take care of the rest.
There will be no proof if Omino dies and Hanzo disappears.
It's not that simple.
You're Killer Kanbei?
You've finally appeared.
Razor Hanzo.
What are you nosing around for?
Why dig up the past?
To live.
I'm only an officer, so I must do this in order to live.
It's all over if you die here.
You'll end up the same anyway.
You and Omino must die.
I'll try my luck.
A man's gotta gamble.
You were banished anyway.
Nobody cares if I kill you.
You helped Oyura and got rid of the Iga spies?
Just as I thought.
Shouldn't we weigh him down with stones and sink him in the sea?
And can I have Omino?
What?
Kanbei's woman became your mistress.
Now, she'll become mine.
So we're brothers of sorts.
As long as I have her, you'll be kind to your younger brother?
I'm counting on you.
Well...
Who are you?
You don't even take your shoes off?
Where do you think you are?
Genpaku's place.
I'm an officer.
Where's Oyura's room?
You can't enter freely here!
Want to lose an ear?
Intruder!
Who are you?
What impertinence!
I see.
You've got a lot of spirit for a doctor's daughter.
Fool. Entering a lady's room without permission.
Hanzo Itami of the magistrate's office.
Oyura, daughter of
Dr. Genpaku Inamura.
I arrest you for harboring Kanbei and his men.
That's why I'm here.
So don't resist arrest!
You came to arrest me?
Who do you think I am?
I'm favored by Lady Oraku and have permission to go to the Castle.
Coming here without permission and accusing me falsely.
What will the consequences be?
Not only will you die, but the North Magistrate must also die.
You don't mind that?
Wretch!
You can't come here!
Begone!
Quiet!
I don't care whether it's under our jurisdiction or not!
If it's in Edo, I go anywhere.
What's a doctor's home?
I'll get in touch with the magistrate and have you executed.
That's all right with you?
Hara-kiri hurts, you know.
I've already cut mine.
Look.
I stopped the blood and bandaged my stomach to keep in my entrails.
Take a good look at it.
Oyura, Kanbei's dead.
Onishi confessed and I have Omino.
I've checked up on you!
It's a big case that will go all the way to the Castle.
That's why I've already cut my stomach open!
I'm ready to die!
Oyura.
I'm arresting you.
Ready?
Where am I?
My place.
You didn't cut it?
I fixed it up with dog's blood.
You fooled me?
You! What are you doing?
Wretch!
What're you doing?
Scum! Wretch! Let me go!
That hurts!
Let go of me!
I'll have you all beheaded!
What are you doing?
Oyura, what's between you and Lady Oraku?
Don't stop.
Please don't stop.
What's the secret?
I have a tattoo on my body.
You'll see in the bath.
Powder tattoo?
Stand up.
A love letter?
"To Ichinojo"
I see now.
I'm free to come and go, so she uses my body to write letters.
Then when she is off-duty, she sees Ichinojo, the actor.
To think that a petty officer can become a figure at the inner castle.
Master, the magistrate!
He's on his way here!
Where's Dr. Inamura's daughter?
You broke into his home and -
Are you safe?
What is it, Father?
I'm going to stay here from now on.
I have Lady Oraku's permission.
What happened, Magistrate?
There's no case.
No one was murdered or robbed.
Everything's peaceful and quiet.
Your order.
NOODLES
One for me.
Not that, sake.
Sis.
Hurry!
I've got money.
- You don't mind if it's hard liquor?
- Anything!
Sis.
One more.
So young and -
- Give it to me!
- All right.
Sis!
I'm all right.
Let's hurry.
Here's your money.
No, you needn't pay.
Don't be rude.
No, I didn't mean to be rude.
Kill me! Kill me!
Father!
Father!
I'll make it easier for you this time!
Look the other way.
Don't turn around.
Father!
I'll do it, Sis!
Fool!
Sis!
You'll be dragged around, then crucified as punishment
Kill me!
I'm in pain.
Father!
Yes, you'd be crucified.
Then your father wouldn't be able to rest in peace.
I'm an officer-
I know.
I see.
What can we do then?
He'll live only about a month more.
The doctor said so.
He won't recover.
He'll suffer a month and still die.
I'm sorry for him.
The least I can do is kill him to put him out of his misery.
You'll be killed too.
Even if I'm crucified, I'll do it.
Why does she have to be crucified?
It's patricide.
I know how you feel.
It's natural since you love him.
But it's patricide.
You'd be crucified.
The law is merciless.
So I ask you not to do it.
Stop it!
I've got myself in trouble.
If I leave, she'll kill him.
But I can't keep my eye on her all the time.
Do you know my place, son?
At Hatchobori?
That's right.
Go there and tell them
I said to bring Dr. Inamura here.
Does he bleed when he has a bowel movement?
Yes, for a long time.
I used an imported sedative, so he's not in pain now.
The pain will come back, but I can use it only once.
In his condition, he'd die if I used it again.
Hopeless.
There's a tumor in his stomach.
A terminal disease.
A month at best.
It's hopeless?
No mistake.
I see.
I'm leaving.
Listen, you two.
Go outside.
Don't come in until I say so.
All right. Come in.
Father!
Call the landlord.
Say he hanged himself.
The doctor gave him only a month?
In pain?
Yes.
So he hanged himself?
It's terrible to live in pain.
Better off dead.
Yes, it is.
Investigation over.
You report it.
Yes. Thank you.
It'll be December soon.
You don't mind being fired next year?
She uses my body to write letters.
But that's
the government's problem.
Be reasonable.
Kanbei wasn't banished at all.
I'll tell all.
He glares
His eyes full of anger
The veins in his temples
Stand out
His lips
Firmly pressed together
A man of pride through and through
He's an officer of the law
His spirit snarls at the government
He's just a petty officer
Razor Hanzo's anger explodes
He is the Edo's watchdog

We beIong to the force.

It was aII my fauIt sir.

So it's priceIess.
Thank God
Rio GrandoI didn't take it away.
We need it to fund our MartiaI Arts Centre.
How did the poIice find out?
I aIIowed the two men to handIe too much money.
But I sense an informer.
It was probabIy Masaoka from the Seibukan SchooI.
Masaoka?
Among his pupiIs is...
..Sergeant Yamagami.
The Seibukan men are dangerous.

Steady... Go!

I can't do it Father.
Your souI is not ready.
Make your mind a totaI bIank.
You are stiII preoccupied.
- Try again.
- Yes sir!
I'II try again.
Don't teII me they fired you.
No. I asked to work on the case fuII time.
To repair my error.
And after some argument they Iaid me off.
I consider it permission to go ahead in my own way.
Just Iike you.
Look.
Otaguro eIiminated the two men we'd marked.
I think it proves the importance of his scheme.
The Asian MartiaI Arts Centre that is.
He's aIready raised more than five biIIion yen from Asian countries.
That much?
And I think he has a 'big brother' supporting him.
What do you mean?
I mean the Mafia is behind him.
The poIice have been working on
FBI information.
But no evidence so far.
If that's reaIIy the case it's awfuI for our nation.
Kono! Kono!
Send word to aII our Asian chapters.
To investigate the way
Otaguro raises money.
If there's anything dodgy have witnesses come to Japan immediateIy.
Yes sir.
By the way I want to know more about Tsurugi.
Tsurugi?
Where does he come in?
No ordinary man couId've done what was done to the two men.
Damaging the vocaI cords with fingers.
The way he acted with his hands shackIed.
It reminded me of Takuma Tsurugi.
If it's him you have a dangerous enemy Yamagami.
He is a genius.
I fought him once.
I met his Iate father whiIe we were in China through karate.
Mr Yamagami give me a Iesson.
HeIIo Kazuko.
You must be making progress.
Your eyes are shining.
AIright I'II give you a work out.
That's it Kazuko.
- PIease!
- OK!
You reaIIy are good.
Otaguro.
I've come as a feIIow karate man to give you advice... or rather a break a chance to think it over.
I'm shocked to hear those words from you Masaoka.
I aIso beIieve in bushido.
How wouId I do such a thing?
I wish you weren't.
But the poIice investigations...
Wait.
Look at that.
Construction wiII start very soon.
I'm absoIuteIy on the IeveI.
If this can't convince you nothing can.
Otaguro.
I had a good reason to say what I just said to you.
ReaIIy?
If you refuse to reconsider we'II have to meet again.
I've been expecting you.
No wonder he's the number one in the Arabic countries.
SHINSEI CONSTRUCTION LTD
This is the pIan.
What I want to know is the actuaI dates of construction.
For various reasons
I can't give the dates yet.
How about the cost?
Who authorised you to ask such things?
Do you have a warrant?
If not forget it.
Our guest is Ieaving.
Do something!
Stop it... Stop!
Stop...
You've given me an idea of what you are up to.
Who needs music for training?
I Iove this song.
It aIways takes me back to Okinawa.
I have no parents back home.
Just their graves.
StiII it's my home.
Cut those Okinawa things out!
Such harsh words...
But I won't say anything back to you.
If you hadn't picked me up when I was starving where wouId I be?
I owe you a Iot.
Ouch!
Tsurugi.
Kitajima Station. South Entrance.
Go now. Kitajima Station.
South Entrance.
Understand?
Hear that? It said now.
TO MR TS URUGI
Who's this from?
How do you know me?
What was he Iike?
KILL KENDO MAS AOKA
Takuma!
Are you afraid of Masaoka?
Say what you Iike.
I just can't.
You've got to.
RidicuIous.
You can't controI me just because you pay me.
You ought to know where you stand.
It's no use threatening me.
You know that I'm not part of your team anyway.
WeII?
His roIe is over.
He knows too much.
He knows too much.
Knows too much.
TeII me why.
Why turn him down?
I'm aIso a human being.
Masaoka is the onIy man who understands me.
For that they'II kiII you.
Then you're wasting your Iife.
This coId gets me.
What made you come here anyway?
We stiII have time.
Let's go back to Tokyo.
Takuma!
Are you hurt?
You are!
Takuma!
Takuma!
You've got quite a physique.
An athIete?
Ping-pong? Badminton?
Anyway I do karate a bit.
I've got to fourth Dan.
Fourth Dan. Did you hear me?
It's a great thing karate.
It has OrientaI mystique.
Defence can be offence.
The master toId me there's nothing to be afraid of except starvation.
So I ate too much and I keep gaining weight.
My chop can reverse the heart
Iike this!
It's so powerfuI it turns the heart upside down.
Hey take a Iook at this.
This is Matsuba Kuzushi.
My throat hurts a IittIe in here though.
And wouId you beIieve?
I can break a rock.
How embarrassing.
Heat does harm to karate chops.
You'd better remember that.
We karate fighters caII it a burn.
Do you?
Don't worry.
I'm can stiII do some damage.
For instance...
I've got to fourth Dan!
This is the head of the Rangoon Chapter.
One night he disappeared.
A week Iater he was found dead in the harbour.
I remember him. A devoted man.
It turned out that he was eIiminated by the Mafia.
We found this in his desk.
A 1 00000 doIIar donation was demanded.
By Otaguro.
A threatening Ietter.
In New DeIhi three men were forced to make contributions.
One of them had to give up his jeweIs.
Now we have enough evidence to question Otaguro thoroughIy.
Takuma wait!
Not the Mafia again.
I wanted peace tonight.
Did the Mafia send you as weII?
No Takuma don't go!
It's dangerous.
Takuma! Takuma!
Takuma! You can't go!
Shikenbaru...
Yes it's me Shikenbaru.
Stab us!
Together!
I thought you were dead.
Not untiI I kiII you Tsurugi.
I'II Iive to see that day.
This is the age of advanced medicaI deveIopments.
Even a heart can be transpIanted.
If you have the wiII to Iive and enough money they can give you artificiaI vocaI cords.
CertainIy the Mafia sent me to get you.
But remember even if they hadn't
I'd do it myseIf.
Because I survived so that I couId kiII you.
Come Tsurugi.
Some pIace where nobody wiII get in.
Takuma!
Takuma...
Takuma!
This is an insuIt.
You caIIed me here onIy to incriminate me.
It shows how much you want me out of the martiaI arts worId! Good day!
Wait.
We have concrete evidence.
- Kono!
- Yes!
Meet Mr Ken Mao form Rangoon.
And Mr Gorasing
New DeIhi Chapter of WKL.
You've been demanding donations under the pretext of buiIding the Asian MartiaI Arts Centre.
You bIackmaiI weaIthy peopIe.
You even rob those who are short of cash...
..taking their expensive statuettes or jeweIs.
Those who are reIuctant are got rid of by assassins.
We even have the threatening
Ietters you wrote to them.
Not onIy that - according to Yamagami's report you have no intention of buiIding the Centre at aII.
FaIse site. FaIse pIans.
The biIIions of yen you raised were sent to the States.
No!
That's not true.
You are a bad Ioser Otaguro.
Your schooI is the Japanese front for the Mafia.
Isn't it?
You coIIected as much as you couId in Asian countries and contributed to their vauIts.
But not any more.
I couId report it to the poIice.
But I haven't.
As a feIIow martiaI arts master
I'm giving you a chance to decide what to do.
We're in troubIe.
Yes I know.
Otaguro to the Mafia your mistake is unforgivabIe.
Now I'm going to be in direct charge here.
We don't need you anymore.
- Imura.
- Yes.
Let's have a toast.
Cheers!
PIease start.
What is it?
Yamagami!
Yamagami!
Yamagami...
Takuma...
You're aIive Takuma!
Takuma! Takuma!
Takuma come on!
Wake up!
Takuma!
Takuma!
SoIdier!
SoIdiers pIease!
Listen to me!
Shut up!
Daddy isn't a spy. Let him go.
PIease.
Brat!
You are the son of a traitor.
Get Iost.
Daddy! Daddy...
Takuma.
Don't trust anybody.
Be your own man.
You are the only one you can turn to.
Train yourself. body and mind.
Don't let anybody get the better of you.
Takuma. Do you recognise me?
Takuma... You've been aImost dead for three days.
Have some.
You've been with me for three days?
Oh it's nothing.
You've got to get out of Tokyo.
And you?
Don't worry about me.
They never spare a traitor the Mafia.
So you knew about me.
That voice on the tape.
You couIdn't fix that up yourseIf.
I'm sorry.
As a matter of fact I have been watching you for the Mafia.
What I said about
Okinawa was true though.
I have no mother or father that's the truth too.
But...
What I never said was that they'd made me cuItivate you.
Do whatever you want with me.
What I want to do is...
..to get Otaguro for Masaoka.
Otaguro's been kiIIed.
So has Yamagami.
- What?
- They hurt Master Masaoka.
His schooI is finished.
Are you sure?
You are a genius.
The damned Mafia!
Let me go! Stop!
Go!
Boke...
Boke!
Tsurugi...
Tsurugi...
Run...
Run away quick!
What a rotten shame.
Where are they?
Tsurugi. I knew you'd come.
She finaIIy taIked about you surviving.
And here you are.
So you're the boss.
I'm not big enough to be caIIed a boss.
I'm Don CosteIIo
Head of the Far East Headquarters.
Don CosteIIo?
She betrayed us by heIping you.
She paid for it.
I'II teII you something.
We intended to...
..controI the whoIe Asian karate worId.
But you and Masaoka tried to stop us.
I'm sorry.
You have to die.
You asked for it.
Wait.
Let me kiII him.
That particuIar man.
I'II kiII him.
This time.
OK.
Tsurugi.
Are you ready?
AIright.
Tsurugi come on.
KiII him!
Get him!

THE END
I see before me a road... going across the bare fields... and clouds are flying overhead.
LAND OF SILENCE AND DARKNESS
FROM THE LIFE OF THE DEAF-BLIND
FINI STRAUBINGER
When I was a child, before I was like this...
I watched a ski-jumping competition.
And one thing keeps coming back... those men going through the air...
I looked at their faces.
I wish you could see that.
I always jump when I'm touched.
Years go by in waiting.
Could Miss Straubinger... tell us about the animals?
That was a great joy for us.
First we went to the quadrupeds.
There was a hind, full size...
- the animals all are full size... to give the blind an idea of them.
The hind's skin was wonderful.
There was a stag's head... with really big antlers.
Its mouth was open.
I was amazed by its size.
There also were hares... sitting, or in jumping position.
Some were afraid of the mice.
The second room contained birds.
A woodpecker on a tree... very interesting... and another, a green one.
I was delighted.
And a pheasant with its feathers.
What a pity you can't see the colors!
Can Miss Julie tell us about the animals?
They ask... if you could also... tell us about the animals.
I don't know much any more.
Her memory is very bad.
Tell us what you know.
I touched a lot of animals...
I had never seen before.
Pheasants, crocodiles... snakes, tigers, lions... and many others.
Also European animals:
Goats, stags, hares... foxes and even a mouse.
THE FIRST FLIGHT
MEMORIES
I was rather temperamental when I was young.
I made it quite difficult for my mother... she always had to check me.
My father died at the age of 33.
I was hardly six.
And when I wasn't watched...
I could do what I liked.
That's how, when I was nine...
I fell down the stairs... from the third to the second floor.
I fell on my back, and my neck... with such force that a neighbor... thought he had heard shooting.
He asked me if I was hurt.
I told him I wasn't, and I asked him... not to tell my mother.
I climbed the stairs on all fours... because I couldn't walk.
It really was a terrible blow.
I sat down and prayed:
Please, make that my mother won't punish me.
From that day,
I always felt pain... especially in my head.
The doctor said it was my growing up.
A second one agreed.
The third understood I'd fallen.
I always did my best at school.
I was very attentive.
One day the teacher told me:
Fini, you should write on the lines.
I said yes, of course.
Then I understood...
I couldn't see the lines any more.
I wanted to learn embroidering... but I had to leave that very soon.
They told me to go home... because I couldn't see enough.
I didn't care about embroidering any more.
That was the beginning of the end.
First I went blind.
I was 15 years and 9 months.
Then I had to stay in bed.
My eyes hurt very much.
At 18 I began to have ear troubles.
At first I didn't understand those sounds... and one day
I was completely deaf.
Mother talked to me and I didn't hear her.
She came to my bed and asked:
Why don't you answer me?
I said: Did you say something?
Yes, but you don't answer.
I said I hadn't heard anything.
We were very frightened.
My deafness was very strange.
First it was the right ear... and then the left one.
I wanted to see a doctor...
I took foot-baths, I prayed... but it wasn't any use.
Gradually I lost my hearing... up to a rest of 5%.
I fled to religion.
It gave me strength... but this terrible loneliness stayed on.
People promised to visit me... but they didn't come.
And when they came, they talked to my mother... and I stayed in my silent world.
And when I talked, my mother hit me lightly... and said she'd tell me later.
I wanted to participate.
How long did you stay in bed?
Nearly 30 years.
I always tried to get up.
Sometimes
I couldn't move at all.
It was awful.
When the doctor noticed it could be very long... he took me off the morphine.
It was difficult, but I got through it.
People think deafness means silence... but that's wrong.
It's a constant noise... going from a gentle humming... through some cracking sounds to a steady droning, which is worst.
You don't know what to do any more.
It's very hard on us.
Sometimes it makes us rather touchy.
It's the same for the blind.
It isn't total darkness.
You often see all kinds of colors.
Black, grey, white... blue, green, yellow... it depends...
Hello, Mr. Messmer.
I'm very glad... you came here.
Fini invited her friends for her birthday.
They're blind and deaf like her.
It isn't easy to Organize.
Everybody must have a companion... to translate everything in the hand.
Hello, Mrs. Meier.
Where is Mr. Forster?
Hello, Mr. Forster.
Translate everything we say... for Mrs. Meier.
She still sees a bit.
But they also need help... so they don't find themselves unprepared... in the land of silence and darkness.
Hello, dear Juliet.
Where is...
Mr. Hundhammer?
Noble friend George, where are you?
Here.
Hello, Mr. Hundhammer.
Thank you for coming with Juliet.
Hello.
Is everybody here?
Yes, all set.
Who's there?
Mrs. Augustin?
No, it's the "Little Snail".
Hello my "Little Snail".
So hello everybody.
Who will say a poem?
Please translate for the deaf-blind.
I will speak slowly.
For when the deaf-blind can't follow things... and keeps staring into the void... he is very depressed.
I will tell you a poem... reflecting on our situation.
The title is:
The most wonderful art.
To stay apart...
When others have fun...
But being happy all the time...
Gladly carrying out...
The most sacred task...
Renouncing in a noble way...
One's personal desires...
Living in darkness...
From the sun...
But shining like a star...
That is the art that only one...
Whose soul is bent on heaven can understand.
Can I start?
Ann with the beautiful hat...
Which becomes you so well...
You make up for joy...
You have cleaned our stairs...
For which I thank you here...
Today and every day...
For things well done...
Is what I like most of all.
In the afternoon,
Fini and her guests... go to see the botanical garden.
You can touch it lightly.
It's like a column.
Shaped like columns...
That's a cactus.
Very interesting.
This is the cactus' fruit.
The fruit of the cactus.
You can take one.
This is the fruit.
The autochthons eat it.
The flesh is good.
Who eats it?
The autochthons.
Are they ripe?
No, it's too small.
You must peel it.
You must peel it first.
Can I eat it?
Not like this.
Thank you.
Look!
That's bamboo.
- Is it bamboo?
- No.
I didn't think it like that.
It will be January... and I'll have a lot of work.
First the visits here... and then in the Palatinate.
No, not before Christmas.
All I still have to do...
Mr. Schwarzhaber asked me to prepare a show... but what, how and where?
For 4 years,
Fini Straubinger... visits the deaf-blind of Bavaria... on behalf of the League for the Blind.
Accompanied by
Mrs. Mittermeier... who translates everything into her hand... she keeps in touch with the deaf-blind... and takes care of their problems.
My coupon, thank you.
If I were a painter...
I'd represent our condition like this:
Blindness like a black river... flowing slowly like a melody... towards great falls.
On its banks, trees and flowers... and birds singing sweetly.
The other river, coming from the other side... is as clear as the purest crystal.
This one also flows slowly... but without any sound.
Deep down there is a lake... very dark and deep... where the two rivers meet.
Where they join, there are rocks... making the waters foam... afterwards to let them flow... silently and slowly... into that somber reservoir... which lies in a deadly calm... only troubled by an occasional ripple... representing the struggle of the deaf-blind.
I don't know if you can understand this.
The rocks who tear the waters... stand for the depression... the blind and the deaf feel... when they become deaf-blind.
I can't explain it any better... but that's how I feel it.
For more than 2 years,
Else Fährer... lives in a neurological clinic.
She is 48.
Her mother, the only person... who understood her, is dead.
Hello, my sister in destiny.
It's our sign.
She spent two years in a school for the blind... where she learned braille, but she forgot.
Also no one else wanted to take her... she's in this asylum, which isn't her place.
She withdrew into herself.
She never talks any more.
When she still had her mother... she could understand by touching the lips.
But that's all over now.
She keeps looking at you.
For you, Else, for you.
She still looks at you.
I am deaf and blind... like you... deaf and blind.
Not a word.
Maybe that...
Blind... deaf... yes...
We're just alike.
Poor dear, no contact with the world.
She says nothing.
She can't speak any more.
No possibility of contact.
I am Fini Straubinger, from Munich.
Does she talk?
No, but she looks at you.
When you let go of my hand... it is as if we were... a thousand miles apart.
Another much neglected group... unable to assert its rights... in our affluent society... where only production counts... is the group of the disabled.
Society owes them more... than just the right to live... it owes them complete integration... in various aspects.
In fact this is all about... our moral attitude... towards those people.
And frankly, this attitude... still isn't up to the mark.
A society which doesn't respect old people... as part of itself... is condemning itself.
I was very much impressed.
I was very upset when the President... came to me... and then took my hand in his.
His hand was cool, not cold.
And while I was telling of our needs...
I felt the pressure of his hand... as a sign of understanding.
This is what I told him:
Mr. President... think also of the deaf-blind... get us out of our isolation.
Help us to find those... who can break our loneliness.
Could you explain us... the tactile translation?
It's a system of dashes and dots.
But you must take great care... as to how to make them.
For instance, the short dots... are made with a downward move...
- H, G, D, B -
P is an upward move...
For A, E, I, O, U... you touch the top of the fingers.
4 fingers on the palm of the hand... make up a K...
One horizontal dash...
- is a Z.
- Everything goes like that...
...O...
Y... joy.
It's hard to understand.
Who makes you practice?
Practice?
Nobody.
My brother can't learn it.
You could talk to him.
He only speaks his dialect.
Fini visits Ursula and Joseph Riedmeier.
She is deaf and nearly blind.
She understands by following the lips.
You only speak your dialect.
You can't talk properly.
Her brother is blind, but has some hearing left.
You said you'd never learn... the blind alphabet.
He said: Straubinger.
I brought him a money-box.
- Look...
- Joseph, I brought you... a money-box.
To put in coins.
See how it works.
It's our natal home.
That's the vegetable garden.
That's the meadow.
Joseph often mowed it.
Poor man, what a work.
The wash...
Yes, of course...
I don't see anything.
I can't hear anything.
I'm just like you.
Ask if he understood.
Did you understand?
Sit straight!
You aren't that old.
It's the first time... these deaf-blind visit a zoo.
They haven't touched an animal for a long time.
It isn't hard to give them pleasure... but there aren't many people who will help.
Can we take it out?
You can do it.
You're nice.
Can I hold it?
What will its mother say?
DEAF-BLIND BY BIRTH
This is Harald,
Miss Straubinger.
One of my first pupils.
He came here 5 years ago.
He was a wild child... upsetting everything.
It was very hard to give him the habit... of a daily sequence... to teach him tasks.
It took a year... to give him some notions... of the tactile alphabet.
Helen Keller says... that this discovery... is the spiritual birth of the deaf-blind.
That really is the start... of education for those children.
Michael, sitting there beside you... still hears a bit.
We used the vibration method... discovered by the Americans.
He touches the lips of the one talking... and he repeats the word.
It's a car with a trailer.
It's very difficult... to guess at the thoughts of our pupils... how they think, what they feel.
We can only guess at it.
I still remember my visit... about two years ago.
Harald was a little devil.
He was fascinated by watches.
It's much harder still... to teach them abstract ideas.
We give them practical examples.
When we want to explain the meaning of "good"... we say: Harald gets up...
Harald learns,
Harald helps Sabine...
Harald is good.
Then we show him the opposite:
Harald hits Sabine...
Harald takes something away from Sabine...
Harald is bad.
That's how we teach them... good and bad.
Now let's go into the water.
Harald was afraid of water.
It took a year... to get him to go in.
Now I want him to get in by himself.
We use hearing aids for diction courses so they can feel the sound waves.
But even when they can speak a sentence... they can't be taught abstract ideas.
What they understand as "proud, happy" etc... will always be a mystery to us.
Vladimir Kokol is 22, deaf-blind by birth.
Only his father cared for him.
He never had any special training.
It was never tried to awaken him.
He never learned to walk.
He only takes soft food... which he presses between the tongue and the palate.
There he is.
Hello, Vladimir.
That's to indicate I'm here.
We can still get something out of him.
He will never learn to talk... but maybe to interpret signs.
I noticed that sometimes... he presses his nails into my hand.
But he does that because... he has no other way to communicate.
It's not to hurt me.
Don't hurt me, little one.
Look, he gives me the other hand.
That is a radio.
He likes it, he feels something living.
Is it music?
How do you get him to sleep?
How does he know night from day?
That's difficult for the deaf-blind.
They don't adapt to that sequence.
Does he know if it's day or night?
No, but when it's time to sleep... we take him to bed.
And he goes to sleep?
Can he dress by himself?
No, he can't.
Now he reacted.
I must talk.
He'll get to something.
Be a good boy.
I think he's bored.
Heinrich Fleischmann, 51... lives in a home for the aged, with his mother... since about 5 years.
He was deaf by birth and lost his sight at 35.
He was so much neglected by his family... that he forgot how to speak and write.
Rejected by human society... he looked for the company of animals.
He lived with the cows in a stable for a long time.
He's looking for my hand.
He's looking for his mother.
He knows my ring.
We want...
- to talk... a bit.
- Can he talk?
If he could see the lips... he would be able to talk.
When he could see
I talked to him.
5 years ago, in the winter...
I put his hand into the snow... and he said: Snow.
But I've lost contact.
Sometimes he says a word.
But it's very rare.
Did he ask who we were... since our last visit?
- No.
- He doesn't even know his brothers.
Not even his own brothers?
No, he doesn't know who they are.
He doesn't want to see strangers.
Yet he must have...
There is much I don't know...
Good-bye.
Did you say good-bye?
Yes, I said it.
If a worldwide war would break out now...
I wouldn't even notice it.

Where the Nile rises on the equator...
is the Africa of the great lakes.
Uganda is half the size of France.
Her ten million inhabitants have never known famine.
Her agricultural wealth, her exports of coffee,
cotton, copper and to developing industry...
allow her, for the most part, to be less and less dependent...
on the outside world.
It was shortly after the independence...
of this former British colony in 1962...
that Lieutenant Idi Amin Dada became interested in politics.
He rapidly became chief of staff...
and the right-hand man of President Obote,
whom he overthrew in 1971 by a coup ´etat.
Obote was unpopular,
and his fall was welcomed by the population.
He fled to Tanzania and a reward was offered for him,
dead or alive.
General Amin soon attracted attention on the international scene...
with his numerous telegrams to other heads of state.
He called Nixon
"my dear brother"...
and wished him a quick recovery from the Watergate affair.
He congratulated the Chilean junta when it took power.
He ordered the queen of England to send the Scottish guard...
to accompany him to the Commonwealth Conference.
Eighty-thousand Asians installed by the British in Uganda...
at the beginning of the century...
controlled 80% of the country's economy.
In 1972, after a dream,
General Amin declared the economic war,
which meant, on one hand,
giving 90 days to the Asians to leave the country,
taking with them the strict minimum,
and, on the other hand, distributing their business to Ugandans.
Today, the economic war has not yet been won.
Distribution chains and imports have been disrupted.
The country's foreign reserves are at their lowest.
In the capital, it is almost impossible...
to find sugar, flour, imported industrial products,
spare parts or matches.
Uganda holds the record for inflation in Africa.
In one year, prices have risen from 20 to 50%.
On February 10th, 1972,
to set an example and to combat budding guerilla warfare,
General Amin organized
12 public executions...
at the same time in the country's main towns.
Most observers agree...
that several thousand
Ugandans have disappeared...
since General Amin seized power.
Among the missing. '
The vice dean of the university,
the president of the high court, doctors and former ministers.
In 1973, the International
Commission ofjurists...
published a report denouncing
Uganda as a lawless country,
and it wrote about the missing personalities. '
"There is every reason to think that they have been assassinated...
by members of the army immediately after their arrest. "
The whole worlds are looking at General Amin... and at Uganda as a whole.
What will be the future of Uganda?
The people are looking at this.
I would like to speak as the heavyweight champion here in Uganda.
Um...
I am sure I will be in position even to defeat or defend myself.
But I wanted to tell you this:
As a boxer, also I am very happy to receive this as a rugby player... because I've been a member... of the rugby team in Uganda.
And I used to play second row.
You know, pushing is very hard and also wing three quarter.
You should know that
I used to run 9.8 second hundred yards.
This is...
With my speed, with my weight... of, of getting the ball... and when you tackle me, you can harm yourself.
I think you should know this.
But I wanted to tell the boxers... that the only chance to defeat the referee... who are against you... or against the country, is to win by knockout.
This is the only thing.
And this is the most important.
You must do everything possible...
to win by knockout.
You must knock anybody who is sparring with you in the boxing ring.
This is my last. Thank you very much.
Fire!
- All the man in.
- Excellent.
All in the heart.
Very good.
I come from very poor family.
I wanted to tell you this.
And when I became bigger, my father has no money.
I am to work, digging, and then people give me some money for food.
And some money I keep it and I pay my school fees.
And I study through hardship, not just comfort.
And also I used to...
Then I was taken by force into the army... here in Kampala during the war.
And... I went there.
I did not want.
But later on, because of force, during the second World War,
I was taken to Burma.
And I work there until now.
I went through difficulty.
I go to the rank, from my rank, from the rank of lance corporal... up to general now... I became general.
Your Excellence, guard all warmed up.
Formed up in two ranks, ready for inspection, Your Excellence.
And if they found that what you are saying, it is not truth, then they will never listen for you again.
And that, you will lose confidence to the people.
But the people likes me very much.
The reason why I am very popular because I always speak to them truth.
And if I don't have anything to tell them, I keep quiet.
We see the paratrooper school.
On March 10th, 1974,
the general announced,
"With the help of friendly countries,
"Uganda is going to arm to the teeth to reach...
an international combat level. "
As a paratrooper, they know exactly to jump and be into sections.
This song they do before they jump.
It warm them completely.
I can't tell you, because it is confidential in any country... cannot tell you the strength of the army.
Since I came in power, automatically Uganda become revolutionary... not only the armed forces, but the whole police, prisons, the whole public.
You see, lion...
Um, lion... if you don't disturb lion, it can't do any harm.
And also I like very much elephants... because it is a sign of liberty... freedom and it moves freely.
It wants a big space.
This is the elephant.
And this is a sign you can see in Africa.
There is plenty of land where it can move freely.
It can eat completely without being disturbed.
And you find this only in Africa.
And that is why you find that the wild animal... have got freedom mostly in Africa.
And, um...
And, uh, this is actually what I am trying to do... here in Africa.
The reason why I am very popular, my policy all over Africa and every African peoples... wants freedom for their people.
They have requested me to tell their leaders... to give them this freedom... and same policy as I did here in Uganda.
Because here I gave...
a completely full economical independence...
to the people of Uganda.
How many crocodiles here?
Very many, yes.
And this is a very good area of the crocodiles.
It is a headquarter of the crocodile, you can see.
You see as it is running very fast.
I think this might be captain of crocodiles.
Yes. He understand me now.
He's moving.
Very big. Yes.
Yes, very good. Yes.
And we are now going, actually, to the headquarters of crocodile, where they lay more eggs... they produce more children.
We are going now.
And it is very attractive.
And you can see here... hundreds of crocodiles.
Thousands of hippo, you see?
Guinea fowls, in there at the edge. You see?
Guinea fowls.
And this elephant is very big.
You see?
And here it is a place where you can found... there is more crocodile than anywhere in the world.
This place.
We say, "How are you?"
Very good.
He is eating.
He is greeting me also.
And even this crocodile is looking at us.
Can I ask you to move?
Uh? Oh, we still want to watch it.
- You want me to ask it to move?
- Yes.
Hey!
You see, it open this... so that the... ants... can go into the mouth and then it eats.
That's why it doesn't want to be disturbed.
He is sleeping.
And most of them, they lay their eggs under this places.
Down there.
You was telling us that you think the Nile...
is a link between your country,
Sudan and Egypt.
But for ages, it has been the problem between the Arabs and the Africans.
The negros.
What do you think of that?
Yes. It has been because the leaders of Arabs... before, they were not revolutionary leaders.
But today, during my time as a revolutionary leader,
I want to bring everybody... in Africa and Arab worlds very closely, and Asia and Europe.
And, therefore, we, the revolutionary leaders, we want to be friendly with all peace-loving people in the world.
And this is highly appreciated very much... by most revolutionary leader in Arab.
That's why you find that, today, there is more unity... between Africa and Arab than before, especially during my tour of Middle East.
I have toured very many countries, and I have brought them together as one family.
You see?
Elephant is dragged into water.
I think it can't get out.
This is a very, very good picture you can get.
This is the most beautiful part... in the continent of Africa.
Used to be called Madison Falls.
But it is now
Kabalega Falls National Park.
That is the one.
And it is a tourist attraction.
I came so close to the Arab... because Arab found that I am most influencing leader... in Africa... in the continent.
And also I am a leader who speaks the truth.
Did your Muslim religion take part...
into your choice of the Arabs?
It is not because of the Muslim... because the people who broke relationship with Israel... they are not only Muslims, they are Christians.
But they have seen the truth.
And everybody listen for me.
And even in O.A.U., if I don't speak, every leader try to ask why, and I must speak.
Like in a nonaligned conference in Algeria...
I was not feeling well.
I did not speak.
But 15 minutes before the conference closed,
I was brought to come and give a speech.
I gave very good speech,
including Castro broke relationship with Israel after my speech.
Telegram sent to Mr. Kurt Waldheim,
permanent secretary of the United Nations. '
"Hitler and all the German people...
"knew that the Israelis are not people who work in the interest of the world,
"and that is why they burnt six millionjews alive with gas...
on the soil of Germany. "
This telegram was sent the day after the Munich killings.
Some years before,
General Amin had undergone,
as had other Ugandans, paratroop training in Israel.
But I'm trained as a paratrooper in Israel.
But I have got a very good brain.
And even General Dayan knows that I am very good field officer.
You knew Dayan very well?
I know him and...
I know him.
He has been my friend.
He has been giving me dinner, lunch in his house.
If I go to Israel,
I used to stay with Dayan.
He brings air force, band playing for me.
We stay together.
But I must make absolutely truth.
The reason why
I chased them from Uganda... was because of the economy of Uganda.
Uganda was going to be bankrupt.
That is the reason why
I chased away the Israelis.
- You were friends with Golda Meir?
- Yes.
Because she used to give me very good entertainment...
when I go to Israel.
Then you changed completely...
from an Israeli alliance to the Arab alliance.
I changed from Israeli alliance... because Israeli are criminals... and they are not trusted people.
They don't tell the world the truth.
They were taken to Palestine as refugees.
And then they changed Palestine to became the State of Israel... by force of arms... given to them by Americans and the British.
But is it true that you said...
Hitler didn't kill enough jews during the war?
Why do you ask me about Hitler?
The Hitler's problem is now past tense.
Now we are looking forward... for the future generations and a future plan.
We are no longer going back to Hitler's.
You see, the war of Hitler... it was a different war than the war today.
If I am to prepare the war against Israel completely, no, I don't want very many... army, air force and navy... just very few.
And I strike inside Israel... and move people from the whole border towards Israel.
I think the situation would be very difficult... and very different.
Strike from inside with paratrooper?
With the paratrooper, with everything, completely.
Yes, because you got to get there by paratrooper... and also bombing by airplanes... and having few squadron of suicide... these who are determined to be suicide.
And I think that is already in progress... and they are practicing.
The suicide squadrons are already in practicing progress.
I think very many delegations meeting me now, preparing for this.
And they come to conclusion.
It is true.
You'll find it here.
And this will change the type of battle.
And we can command from here, not from the battlefield, but through communication.
And will there be Ugandans in those battalions?
I don't know, but any volunteer.
Even France...
French volunteer... they are welcome also.
But I welcome, I welcome any volunteer all over the world.
Even Japanese, even Vietnamese... are there in these squadrons.
But they are now in training.
They are undergoing training now three months.
This is the pilot.
Then go to the Middle East and visit the war... see how they are fighting and encourage them to fight.
This was my decision.
And I enjoy it very much... having breakfast with some Syrians and Iraqi... breakfast in the tanks.
I was very happy.
In October, while I was there,
I was visiting troops. I had my troops.
You had some soldiers up there?
- I had the navy, yes.
- Navy?
- Yes. In Alexandria.
- Navy?
- But you don't have navy...
- We have trained.
- Ah, really?
- Yes.
This is our secret weapon in Lake Victoria.
Marine. Frogmen I think is very good.
Yes.
In '67,you were on the Suez Canal?
Yes, yes. But you see, I am only one who has been in both sides.
During the '67 war,
I was in Suez Canal, on the other side.
And now I am in the Suez Canal in the other side. I like very much.
First, the armored, after crossing the Lake Galilee, reaching the foot of the Golan Heights, they are engaged by the enemy... and the officer... commanding mechanized battalion... ask for the support... by paratroopers and air support.
You understand?
I'm just explaining to you.
And while the armored... and the mechanized regiment are being engaged, the air force gave support... so that the paratrooper land by helicopter... on the Golan Heights and captured Golan Height.
- We go because helicopter coming.
- Okay.
You film. Film helicopter.
Right now the armored regiment... they have been engaged below the Golan Heights.
And the commander of the mechanized regiment... requested for the support.
And, therefore, the paratrooper have been landing, fighting to capture the objectives.
But air will come and give them support.
They will be...
To capture completely the Golan Heights.
Another one is behind you.
Here, here, here.
Left. Now advance.
- Advance!
- Advance!
Here, here.
Victory over Golan Heights.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
The meeting is nonconfidential... because I think that is why you see here... there is... the press people.
They are taping and they wants to make a film... about the cabinet.
But I have about seven points which I think...
I should brief you completely... and tell you to know... exactly what is going on.
One is this:
All of you, you are in very high-ranking governmental positions.
Your duty is not to be very weak.
You must not be like a woman... who is just weak, and he can't speak, even talk.
You must be a person who... to approach everybody as a minister.
You want to know. You must be concerned to know the problems... as a minister, as a governor, as any high-ranking governmental officer.
This is the one point which I must tell you.
You must be concerned in planning ahead for your ministry.
Nobody is to plan for you,
but it is you, with your permanent secretary... and the whole officer under your command, to plan for you, for your minister, in advance.
Not General Amin to tell you... that you go and plan this and this for your ministry.
You should not be like a ministry of foreign affairs.
I'm speaking not even now when Otiang was there.
Because some people who are rotten... they are there since Otiang was there and also he's there.
These people are never been informed since the former regimes.
What they know is to educate people in common man's chatter only, but not proper educating people... of the worl´s the policy of the government.
This I know direct from international people whom I've been sending.
They have been informing me that people have not been educated outside... to know what actually is happening here in Uganda.
And this is the ministry of foreign affair.
This is the weakness of the minister of foreign affair.
Two weeks later,
the body of Michael Ondoga,
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
was found in the Nile.
He was replaced by a former model,
Princess Bagaya,
who holds a law degree from Oxford.
And everybody must be removed... who have got the ideology... or the mentality... of the capitalist... who are no revolutionaries.
I've been informed by the minister of foreign affair... before even Ondoga came that this is good, this is good, must remain there.
But I found they are rotten completely.
They are the one who have been putting even "shameful," but while our position is very good.
We are not bankrupt completely in Uganda.
We are very rich.
I don't want somebody... any minister...
make me good report.
You must only tell me the truth.
This I've been telling you, and now the truth is coming out.
The false report you have been reporting to me is now coming out.
Now I am going to second point.
As a minister,
governor, high-ranking peoples...
and the people of the country,
they must love their leader.
This is the point number one.
If you go to any country, you will find...
that everybody must love his leader.
They must love their ministers.
They must love their governors.
They must love their district commissioners, their teachers, their chiefs.
Everybody must be loved.
This...
It is an education to the people.
This is the duty of the minister.
If I see the minister is a coward, automatically
I kick you out of my office... because I know that you have got something wrong with you.
I will put some another person straight... or any governor or anybody.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
And even whether you hide, you will be known in the light, completely.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
Whether you hide, you go away, you will be known, completely.
But this particular second point is very important.
You must teach people to love their leader.
This is the only most important.
Like any country.
And the people also must love their ministers.
But loving... it is well known in Uganda.
You can't change as a minister.
Number three: Determinations.
You people must work with determinations.
And all other peoples...
you must teach them to work with determinations.
If I go sometime even in the ministry of defense,
I will not find even some commanders there in their offices.
I know this.
I been telephoning several time, checking with them, I can't find.
They are in their business in Kawempe, somewhere in Kampala, what.
You must put your contribution.
If I find you not attend cabinet three times without reason,
you are out of government.
Now, chiefs... Number four.
Chiefs and town agents.
The most important of the chiefs and the town agents, if they are to work very hard, they will help the police, the prison, the air force, the army.
This include the military police.
They will help you, the ministers.
They will not make even police very busy...
because they know who is actually good in the towns,
who is not very good in the town.
If you are to use these people properly... even the police... use these town agent properly...
They are being paid by the government.
They are not just working for nothing.
And marketing here in Kampala...
You must tell our womens in
Uganda to pull up their socks.
I want to see that Ugandans work very hard.
You must not make the womens of Uganda very weak.
They must get up quickly in the morning.
At about 5:00, they are already in nakassero, preparing ready to sell vegetable and everything in the shop.
If you go to Ghana, if you go to Nigeria, you will see that the whole shops, market, everything.
Is Nigeria.
I think you agree with me.
Everybody agree.
Why not here in Uganda?
You must tell our women I said... that the duty of the woman is the house woman.
He knows how to keep house very well.
If he can do that, let me make first examinations, appoint women to be the managers of hotel, which is done.
Because this is a part of the woman's job.
If they can keep house very well, it is exactly like their duty as a housewife.
If he's well-educated, he has got that brain, he is determined, he can look after the hotel very well.
I want to see a woman international hotel... very big one.
Must be woman Ugandans, and I know they can do it.
And you as a minister, you must back them completely.
If you find any man trying to not to obey the order and everything, you can punish that person.
You can remove that person.
You can put loyal people to her to see that we keep up standard.
I think we are the first in our country, in Africa today, who have got many woman managers than other countries.
We have got how many?
- Manager woman.
- Four.
We have got four manager,
and we have got another two assistant manager.
And another point here
I wanted to say.
There is C.I.A. Agents through Africa...
African, black Africans... who are coming here.
And you should know that spy is criminal.
To be an spy is very bad.
And your case is death, completely... sentence.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
If I found anybody is a spy, and any spy is found and anybody he is coming in this cover...
See, I want you to see that everybody must be checked... his poll-tax... for about three or five years.
And if he is found to be spy, his case is firing squad.
He must be handed straight to military police, must be dealt with the military tribunal... because the case of spying is very serious.
Anybody found is a spy, his case must be dealt with military tribunals.
Once he is confirmed, even military tribunals should not waste time... of making law all day, discussing about one person who is a spy.
Must be shortcut.
If minister find him,
don't even report it to me completely...
I don't want the ministers...
should wait anything which he thinks it is good for his ministry.
He is still waiting authority from me.
I don't want.
Then if that, you are not minister.
You are not making decisions.
A minister is a person who must make a decision himself, not wait for General Amin.
You can only inform me what you are doing, what has happened.
I feel very happy.
Because if I am to make a decision all the time, I will be very annoyed.
If you are not well-briefed, come back to me.
Telephone me at 5.'00 or midnight. You telephone me.
Some minister been telephoning me.
I been answering them.
My telephone is simple.
If you telephone me at 2241, whether at 3:00 in the morning,
I get your telephone, I speak to you.
And if you want a briefing,
I can brief you completely until you understand.
And when you go there, any reporters wants to ask you about Uganda,
I think you are well-equipped with all informations.
You can brief them.
You should not fear.
You should not say,
"No, it is not my duty. "
If you are that, you are not Ugandans.
And if I am to get this, you are not minister at all.
As with many other scenes in this film,
the people's welcome in a small garrison town...
was specially-organized for the film.
I am not completely communism, and I am not capitalism because I...
Even very many leaders ask me to join that part.
That part I don't want.
I am only leader who is alone completely... and following on only Uganda.
And this is how we want.
We want just to be free and also friendly... to the capitalism people, friendly to the socialism people.
But we are not going to adopt anything.
But we only choose what is the best from capitalism, from communism, we put in our, our policy of the country.
And this is what we found better.
We are not following any policy at all.
Seven, eight, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Very... Very new gun.
- From guerillas.
- Guerillas?
This captured when we were invaded.
The general has already reviewed these arms several times.
They were captured during an attack in the autumn of 1972 from Tanzania,
organized by former President Obote...
- accompanied by a few hundred men.
- This submachine gun.
Relations with Tanzania have been uneasy since Amin seized power.
He dreamt of getting, by force of arms,
an outlet to the sea taken from Tanzania.
Your Excellence, all these were captured... by our chiefs as our troops were being trained.
These are homemade.
So I think that's how you can explain about that. Your Excellence.
Telegram sent to Julius Nyerere,
President of Tanzania.
"I want to assure you that I love you very much,
"and if you had been a woman,
I would have considered marrying you,
"although your head is full of grey hairs.
But, as you are a man, that possibility does not arise. "
It was then that you sent this telegram to Nyerere?
What was this?
- I think you read my telegram.
- Yes, what was it?
Was it to make fun of him?
Because I love him very much. Yes.
He did not reply me.
He kept quiet.
I lead the country on my best way, how I want them to be lead... according to my democracy, according to my knowledge... and according to my thinking... what is the best way of leading them.
And then I lead them according to that way.
- There's direct contact between you and the people? - Yes, and the people. Yes.
No middle man.
I have 18 children.
Idi Amin had four wives and has 18 children.
He has just repudiated three of his wives for not being revolutionary enough.
Ah, you see?
This one is very rough.
- Yes.
- How old, this one?
- This one?
- Uh? This one and a half year old.
And this...
- And Omonga.
- We have no preference.
This has been to Paris.
He has been to Soviet Union.
And this is still not yet in school, and this and that.
It's difficult to educate 18 children?
- Not very difficult.
- Not difficult?
I have 12 boys... and six girls.
This the one girl and six boys.
I am very good marksman.
But I like children very much.
Yes, they are very happy.
- That's very good.
- Maybe we could sit down there.
With you?
But you can't see the sun proper.
- You want interview me? Yes.
- Yes.
Every evening, there is a news broadcast...
in four languages on television.
The slightest event concerning the president is reported.
During a press conference with French journalists held at the Entebbe Palace,
His Excellency President Amin announced that he was in possession...
of a manual detailing all of the Israeli plans.
Mecca and Medina should be today... under the control of the Israelis.
But because they lost the war in first five days, they couldn't continue even further.
And that is why it stopped.
But their aim is to capture Mecca and Medina.
All the holy places all over the world... should be controlled by the Israelis.
This is their aim.
I have got these books with me.
And I am sure, after we finish here,
I will give you the copy of the book.
But you reading my copy today, here, and you give it back to me... because, if Israeli find it, they will buy the whole copy.
And they don't want the people in the world to see this book.
I will give you. It is here.
Uh, it is a book of the Israelis...
which is the teaching of the elders of the Israelis... of the Zionists.
The book is a fake,
published in 1901 by the Russian secret police.
Millions of copies were printed.
It was required reading in the schools of the Third Reich.
When asked if it was true that the Israelis wanted to poison the Nile,
General Amin replied that they had indeed wanted...
to do so while they were still in Uganda.
They can poison the water...
River Nile... from Uganda... so that the people who will be drinking in the other end, they will die.
General Amin remarked that the plans of the Israelis...
were even more disgusting than Hitler's against thejews.
Dreaming... it has been the true on my side.
Because some people dream which is not the truth.
But I dream the truth.
I dream, when I was still... just none, nothing, completely,
I will be the army commander.
I am commander of the highest man... commander in chief of the armed forces.
I dream I will be the head of state... and the most highest head of state in the world... when I was just none... and it became truth.
I dream completely in Karamonja, in August the fourth, at about 5:00 in the morning, that, if you take decision now... and remove the whole noncitizens... who are being milking the economy of Uganda, this is the only chance Uganda will get.
You must take immediate actions.
I left the place without breakfast, and I went and declare economic war.
And it is true.
Today, the people in Uganda are enjoying.
This is the truth. I dream about, before end of 1975,
Arabs will win the war.
I think I read did you dream people were trying to kill you?
I dream, but it was impossible.
They couldn't do it.
Because I know exactly...
I dream that in...
I know exactly when, how, what time I am going to die.
This I know.
And which year and which date.
All this I know already, and it is a secret.
I have said this clear.
Yes, I know. That is why you find me, I am not a coward... because I know exactly how I am going to die, following all what has been happening.
And I know exactly.
And I can know, sometime, what will happen in the country or to me... in the next few hours or few days.
I know this exactly.
And I know exactly that who will be making something... against me very soon.
I can notice him straight.
And he can get punishment from God straight.
Because I work only according to the Go´s instruction.
And I know exactly that who will be making something... against me very soon.
I can notice him straight.
And he can get punishment from God straight.
Because I work only according to the Go´s instruction.
It is voice of God, and it is not me just speaking, but it is the truth and it is meaningful.
And if you are to follow de Gaulle, he was a very great leader.
Napoleon... very great leader.
Mao Tse-tung is very great leader.
And... this leader whom I'm saying...
- Very great. Who is another you said?
- Qaddafi?
Qaddafi is very popular, whether the people in the Arab worlds in some way against him.
It is impossible, like me.
Here it is impossible.
We already put foundation stone of our... how strong we are in the worlds.
And the people understand.
And even I am still fighting... for the whole black people all over the worlds... in Caribbeans, in Negro Americans, all over the world, which I am still fighting for them.
And they respect me very much and very highly.
And they were taken to America as slaves... those people.
They did not want to go there.
And this is their country, but they were taken by force.
Therefore, nobody should remove them from there.
They must get independent in America, and they must control the Americans.
The black people in America... must be the president of the United States of America... must be the secretary of state, like Kissinger.
They are more brilliant... than the Dr. Kissinger.
Kissinger is not very intelligent.
Kissinger always go to the weakest leaders.
He never go to Qaddafi.
He never come to General Amin.
He fears us. You see?
This is what Kissinger is going.
He goes only to the weakest leaders.
Because he know there is the strongest leaders in Uganda.
And he will never go to Uganda.
- They are afraid of you?
- Yes.
Because I speak the truth, and I know their mistake.
I know their mistake, and I know how to teach the America their mistake.
On speaking of the Americans, the general said...
that he had in his possession certain equipment they used...
to spy on the Russian and Chinese embassies.
He noted that President Nixon wanted to export Watergate to Uganda.
And you see, this is the mistake of Nixon... of Watergate.
He was bringing in Uganda, taping all embassies...
Chinese embassies, Russian embassies.
All this problem was brought by...
And thaØs why they left...
because they got afraid when you discovered the thing?
That is why they run away from me.
And I say that how can 250 million... run away from only General Amin?
That I am very powerful than Americans.
I have no Phantoms.
- But you have MIGs.
- Hmm?
I have a brain.
Because I discover their mistake in advance.
Because my brain work in advance than them.
When I come out, we have to capture this port.
Eh? Everyone must reach this port.
- We are diving.
- I am not diving.
- just a jump.
- If you dive down, we cut you.
You must jump here and then start this straight.
Ready? You do now.
You give us green light.
Give us the time too. Ready? Go.
Very good.
I won.
I have seen the whole African... how they suffered, including my father and everybody.
- I know this very well.
- Can you tell a story?
- Hmm?
- Can you tell a story with that?
- I will just give you simple.
- An example.
People used to carry British on their heads.
British used to send...
They make something like a stretcher... and put chair on top.
And then they used to carry
British for miles and miles.
This is African carry.
And they used to dig holes and everything.
They used to carry when the British was here.
And the Africans, when they make a mistake, they used to be beaten by canes, completely, by the British.
You should like to see Mr. Heath?
I would be... I will never talk to anybody from Britain... if Mr. Heath himself does not come to me here.
Yes, here in Uganda, because I declared economic war here in Uganda.
And I will see him in command post. Not anybody.
If Mr. Heath does not come, then it is not my problem.
It is up to him.
It is up to him now to beg me.
If he doesn't beg me, it is up to him.
Because I am the one who has got the money.
I am not going to borrow money from him.
Even I don't want, I am getting millions of shillings.
Uganda is getting from selling their crops... and everything every years.
British now, actually...
They are in chaos, as you know.
Their economic is in chaos, completely.
I think if I am really British,
I could run to France... and ask the financial and assistant in France.
It is just your neighbor there.
You should help them.
Like, I am very far away from London.
But I am helping them. I am collecting.
I am appealing for everybody in the world to assist the British.
We made a collect of over 43,000 shilling.
And what Mr. Heath said?
- Mr. Heath?
- About this collect.
Uh, he said...
He hasn't replied me yet.
- He hasn't?
- Yes.
I am very annoyed.
I am waiting for his reply so that...
I have requested him for airplane... so that I can send the food.
Because some people donated food lorry of vegetable.
Three tons to be given to the friends in Britain.
But he hasn't send airplane yet.
But maybe it will be deteriorated?
I don't know. It is up to him... because I had sent on the very day they donated the food.
I have very many friends in Britain.
It is only the problem
I had to put to them.
That is why they have more problem.
You see there? I'm trying to help.
Even myself,
I donated 10,000 shilling...
from my own saving to Save the British Fund.
We have opened the fund here...
Save the British Fund.
Yes.
I wanted to... make... special language in black America of African... because I wanted to... brainwash them from British colonials.
And I wanted to make them understand one language in America.
I might introduce Swahili... to all black American... to understand this language in America.
You laid the stone of a foundation...
of a new broadcasting station.
Which country will it cover?
It will cover including France.
Including everybody,
I think, in Europe, in America, in Soviet Union,
China, everywhere.
It will cover...
So that in all Africa... people will listen for radio broadcast... from Uganda, direct.
This is very important.
Will you speak in English or...
No, it is going to be Swahili,
English, French, Arabic.
This is four official language will be spoken.
English, French, Arabic and Swahili.
Would you accept some Palestinian hijackers...
with their hostages in Uganda?
- The Palestinians?
- Yes, I read in the papers...
they were asking to be sent to Uganda or to Libya.
If they are sent here,
I would welcome them.
Because we believe in peace.
And that is why in the United Nations... they have already passed... one of the agenda... that the Black September should be treated... as prisoner of war, but not as the criminal... because they are fighting for their cause.
So you will put them in prison if they come here?
I don't know whether
I will put them in prison, but I know how I will keep them.
But they are welcome.
- In Uganda?
- Yes.
If they want to come to Uganda, they are welcomed in Uganda.
They have got representative.
Having expelled the Israelis,
General Amin installed the Palestinians...
in the former Israeli embassy.
But the people in some planes are innocent.
But you must not go in the airplane... which is belonging to Israelis, to Portuguese, to South Africa.
If you use these airplane, then it is up to you.
You must choose because the airplane is booked in advance.
You must know this.
It is not
Black September's mistake.
It is the people's mistake... because they are the one who choose what airplane they should fly in.
You must fly in Air France.
You must fly in East African Airway.
This is very good.
Faced with fines or imprisonment,
the naked tribesmen of Karamonja...
are forced to wear clothes.
Women are forbidden to wear wigs,
trousers or miniskirts.
General Amin has planned to group together...
the idle and unemployed and make them work in cooperatives.
You can actually educate people through traditional dance... how to make very good garden like this.
It will be in the song.
When you are singing, people are watching.
You talk about the flower. You must make very good garden in your house.
You must have house with big latrines.
Make it clean. People will understand.
"Oh, this song has got meaning.
I must go and make this. "
And you must boil the water before you drink... because you might have disease in the stomach.
You are helping doctor.
You understand?
You must work hard.
You must produce more foods... for export, for selling to get more money... and for your self reserve in case of dry season.
Hot sun.
You will have a reserve food in your store.
You will not die from hunger.
You are all right for your communication?
Yes, sir.
That's very good.
As a pilot, you must know... your all techniques within the aircraft.
You must know map reading very well, completely.
You must be ready to go and fight...
in any part of Africa...
which is still under imperialist domination...
if you have been directed to go... with other forces of the O.A.U. Members.
This is the one of the things.
But you are still to go for another intensive training.
You are to go for another... fastest airplane than this one.
You are to go.
Only one pilot, if he is to do his duty properly,
he can really make a big destructions.
And also, as a pilot, when you are going to fight, you must not think... that you are going back to the base.
But you must fly while knowing...
that you are going to complete your mission.
But if, God bless you, you go back... back to the base.
Amin gets ready to face...
a much more critical audience than his usual audiences.
It is a gathering of the capital's eminent physicians.
Indulge a private practice...
and to fight the economic war.
There has been growing concern in the public...
about some doctors who have located surgeries...
and others who have located private businesses...
have been spending most or a lot of their time...
and much of their attention...
was increasingly being drawn...
to their businesses in their private surgeries.
First, I would like to thank you for what you have been doing.
You have been doing very well.
And to be a doctor is not very easy thing, right from the time you have been born.
Because you went through difficult... through primary schools.
And you have been very intelligence.
You pass your primary school.
You went to secondary schools.
You pass.
You went into higher school.
You pass.
You proved to be very intelligent.
And that is why you have been selected... to be a doctor.
I know this very well because
I come from very poor family.
I know how... the person can come... right from the village level... up to the top standard of the doctor.
It is very difficult.
And don't spoil that chance.
When you have reached this standard, what you should do... you should practice more.
You should specialize... in some more fields... so that you will be able to help... and assist the people in the country.
And, as a doctor, you must be very clean, very smart.
You behave very well like a person.
And also, you are not too drunk.
You are the one who should advise the public.
You should advise General Amin not to drink.
This is very important.
This is the most important, because if a public learn... that you are drunkard,
automatically they lose confidence.
And even they can say that, if I am going to get operation by that doctor, he is a drunkard, he will not do anything good for me.
And they will completely refuse.
I am telling you sincerely.
And it is true. I must be frank to you and tell you this.
Because, also, to drink and overdrunk... it is not very good.
You will not even enjoy more.
Because you will not even have sense.
But if you drink very little, you feel very happy, very proud, and you talk to the people.
That will be... I'm just advising you.
If I am a commander of operations...
I wanted to fight... in Lugasi sugar factory.
I just giving you this.
Okay. There is enemy there.
What I want to use... air force.
What I will ask...
I will call the engineers.
I will call the pilots... and talk to them.
Can you, from this base and this base... can you reach Lugasi, come back without refilling?
Yes. How long can you fight there?
Give me timing.
This technicians will be in position, advising before I give any order.
And they tells me completely everything... how long they will be there and how long they will fight... and what is the number of the enemy and all this.
Then I write all this, discussing with the technician.
This is like a public service commission.
When they want to recruit the doctors, they come to you, you advise them.
But it is your duty as a doctor... to advise them properly... and your duty as a doctor... to advise your representative... who can represent you or myself or him properly... so that when he takes, he brings the points... concerning the medical field in the cabinet to me,
I have a full report... submitted to me, not only by him, but by you, the technicians.
Because you know the whole technical problem.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
You have any points to tell me?
Yes?
Your Excellence,
I'm quite happy to have heard...
that you are quite ready...
to be listening to the senior doctors.
Not only the senior doctors, but the young doctors, for the lives of the citizens are in their hands.
In Uganda, the Uganda Medical Association... seems to be the main spokesman...
for every doctor all over the country.
The president of our association...
In Uganda, only Amin is allowed to be called president.
You leave him to speak.
- I withdraw the title...
- I am... I...
I am General Amin.
The chairman of our association,
who is a very active person,
who I am sure was not concerted about these rumors...
which have been floating around...
about the private surgeries in town.
So much so that he was...
and ourselves seriously caught unaware...
of what is happening.
With due respect to the minister,
Your Excellency,
and your technicians in Entebbe,
I would like to tell you that our chairman...
is quite fluent with the problems affecting the doctors...
on public health.
I would, therefore,
request you, kindly and humbly,
to keep him in mind...
that, whenever there is any big problem...
that concerns a doctor,
if you take off your permanent secretary...
and if you are assistant immediate to him,
the next man to consult...
should be the chairman of the Uganda Medical Association.
Thank you very much.
I like this type of frank discussions.
And it is very good.
Um, I am sure... that I informed the permanent secretary...
I will be addressing... the senior doctors... within three days.
Every year, the eight masters of the Shaolin divisions...
Every year, the eight masters of the Shaolin divisions... held a meeting at the mid-autumn festival.
One year at such a meeting, the masters... after many days of consultation and study... had taken into account their own... and all other known kung fu techniques... combined the best of all these into a new technique... which they called "The Eight Steps of the Snake and Crane."
After the eight masters had recorded all the details... of the new Snake and Crane technique into a book... they placed the book for safe custody in the hands of Master Lin.
Together with the book and to show how important they considered this to be... they also gave to Master Lin the dragon spear... which was his emblem of authority... as the custodian of the most precious... and most dangerous secret in the kung fu world.
Shortly after that, all the eight masters mysteriously disappeared... together with the book, and chaos reigned in the whole of South China.
Hey, you.
You're in trouble, friend.
We all just saw that you got the book of the Snake and Crane technique.
But if you hand it over, we'll let you go.
Goddamn it!
Didn't you hear what he said?
I see.
So you know how to fight.
Well, today you're up against the Ting brothers.
Well, I have heard of you three.
- I must admit.
- Brother, it seems like we're famous.
You're not famous.
You're simply well-known.
- There's a difference?
- Of course there is.
You're not famous at all.
You're notorious.
You're thugs.
- Who are you?
- My name's Su... Su Yin Fong.
All right. But remember.
- I swear we'll meet up again.
- Can hardly wait.
Let's go.
My buns! Goddamn you!
- Is that enough?
- Sure. Enough for the whole shop.
Hey, kid, you want some food?
- You're paying?
- That's right.
Really? No matter how much, you'll still pay?
Of course.
I want a big dish of fried pigeon and roast duck... and some chicken soup and some mint scallops.
Let's see.
Some giblets and some pickled ham... followed by some pig's knuckles and then some double-fried tripe.
- Also, some meat buns.
- Now look.
This is a big order.
It'll take a long time.
Also, it'll cost a lot.
So what! He's paying.
- Hey, right?
- Sure.
I'm paying.
I'm sorry.
I'll go tell the cook to hurry.
Hurry up!
Hey, did you hear about the eight masters... and the secret book which disappeared at the same time they did?
Well, the book's been seen here.
Well, that explains it then.
That's why there's so many fighters gathering here.
Please.
Hey, I'm Hong Tu.
I'm a wanderer.
What's your name?
And what do you do?
Ny name's Su.
That's Su Yin Fong.
And I'm a wanderer.
I came here to find someone.
Oh, yeah? Who?
Well, I don't know.
Don't know who you're looking for?
Well, this person... will come looking for me.
What if they don't?
I'm quite sure that they will, though.
But why?
- I can't tell you that.
- Hey, coming, sir.
Your food's here.
Start with this.
And I'll bring the rest.
Good appetite.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.
Hey, friend, you picked on the wrong man.
The Snake and Crane book!
You!
I told you I was certain that they'd come looking for me.
Look out! Behind you!
Hey, we're from the Wu Tang clan.
Be smart, friend.
Hand over the book and quick!
It's right here.
Come and get it yourself.
Right!
- Don't fight!
- Finger.
My restaurant!
Oh, not again!
Yes, sir? Want something?
Sorry, but I promise
I'll pay for all this.
- Thanks.
- My eye. My eye!
- Thank you.
- And I'll have a clean room too.
Of course.
Your technique, it's very strange.
It's a new one.
I'll show you something.
Try to break this.
Try again.
Hold it.
Always try not to hit too hard.
Hey, are you crazy or plain stupid?
Neither of the two.
I think I'm quite smart.
In fact, a genius.
Genius? You're kidding.
You're the dumbest person that I've ever met.
But why?
All those guys are after you because of the book you've got.
And you show the book around too.
It's just inviting trouble.
Tell me, you interested in the book too?
I certainly am not!
But, still, could I have a look?
Sorry!
Suit yourself. I don't care.
But one day you'll want to show it to me.
Who are you?
A friend.
- What kind of friend?
- A friend.
- What do you want?
- Want you.
- Where at?
- Temple.
- I've no choice?
- That's right.
- You always only use two syllables?
- Most times.
Please.
I hear that you have the book of the eight masters.
- That's right.
- How much do you want for it?
Can't tell you.
I never do business with women.
Why not?
Because women are just like children.
They're too vague, not decisive.
Do you know who I am?
I know you're a woman, a pretty one.
I'm the leader of the Tang clan of Sai Chun... Tang Pin Nhur.
Oh, that right?
Well then, will you give me the book now?
I told you, I don't do business with women.
That book may be able to help me... to find my father who's missing.
And I'm going to have it at any cost.
There are a number of others who all feel the same way.
How did you get hold of it?
And also, the dragon spear, where's that?
That's my secret.
Well, do you know where the eight masters are now... or what happened to them?
Sorry. Also, my secret.
I'm warning you.
Till you tell me your secrets, you're not leaving.
The Snake and Crane.
Hold it.
You can go.
Listen. Before I go, a word of advice.
You'd be an even prettier girl if only you learned to smile a bit.
Oh, you're back.
- Hey there. How's the eye?
- Better. Thank you.
Can I help you?
Coming. Coming.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't know me?
So it's you.
Well, now, are you going to let me have a look at that book?
I'll say this.
You're extremely good at makeup.
Nobody would guess that you were a fella.
But I'm glad that you are.
Otherwise, it'd be awful.
What does that mean?
What's so awful about being a girl?
Well, you're not a good-looking man, so I imagine if you were a girl...
You...
You are the worst man that I've ever met in my life!
You're intolerable.
Maybe... but nobody's perfect.
But I do have possession of that book, though.
And that does give me a certain charm.
That right?
Who cares about your book?
Women are so emotional.
Not like us fellas.
You're right. That's why
I'm so frightened of all women.
Tell me. Why were you hiding?
I'm sorry. I never meant to.
I was on your bed sleeping peacefully.
Then all of a sudden the girl comes in.
So I really didn't have any choice except to hide there.
I assume that you're another one who's come here after the book then?
You're right.
My gosh, you're so smart.
Now then, are you going to give it to me nicely, or do I have to take it?
Neither way.
And I want you to leave right now.
Hey, fellow, you're real odd.
Odd fellows can be tough too.
- Do you know who I am?
- I know that you're a leader of a clan...
Beggar's clan.
You're a smart fellow, just like I said.
And now let's find out just how talented you are.
You would have been finished if I'd have used this end.
You mean business.
You see?
I could have finished you then.
That's enough!
All right, guess
I have to admit defeat.
- But I have one question.
- What's that?
Why are you deliberately letting everybody know you have the secret book?
- I'm looking for a man.
- Who's that?
What's all this?
- I'm looking for a certain mark.
- But what mark?
Sorry, I can't tell you.
At least not now.
Listen. You must know your own business best.
But here's a word of advice.
Be most careful and trust no one... because that book is of the utmost importance.
I'm going.
So the book really is in Su's possession.
Yes, it is.
Saw it with my own eyes.
Mr. Chien, your man is quite right.
We also saw it.
Su has the book.
Mr. Chien, we do know that you're very keen on getting that book.
So, for a quarter of million in silver... we'll get it for you.
The Black Dragons can handle this by themselves.
But thank you for the offer.
Well, in that case, we may as well go now.
But if in the future you should change your mind... then our price will be high.
You watch Su Yin Fong.
Check every movement.
- What would you like?
- Some tea and some noodles.
All right, fine.
- Waiter!
- Yes, coming.
Come in.
Boss! Boss!
- Are you Su Yin Fong?
- That's right.
- All right, come with us.
- Where to?
To see a lady.
Well, who is she?
Black Dragon, fighting clan,
Lady Suon. That's who.
If I refuse?
Refuse?
- Let's get out of here!
- Fight!
Not again!
They're fighting again.
Not bad.
You've seen our skills now.
You better come.
Not bad.
All right, you coming?
Well, I have this bad habit.
I like to fight people who fight well.
Get him!
Let's get him! Get him!
Well, now, still insisting.
Oh, no.
Well, in that case,
I'll come, all right?
Sure. Sure.
- Please.
- Thanks.
- Hey, waiter, where's my food?
- It's coming. It's coming.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
My lady, Su Yin Fong's here.
Right.
You... You are Su Yin Fong?
That's who I am.
But you're not Lady Suon.
- What makes you think that I'm not?
- I just know it.
Well, how do you know?
Did you ever meet her then?
I never met Lady Suon.
But I do know she's not only pretty... but she wears a special scent.
She's pretty... but she doesn't wear scent.
You really are very smart.
What's more, you're nice.
I am quite smart, but still, not nice.
Why not?
The nice die young... because they're not smart.
And you're so right.
I assume that I'm not here to discuss my qualities.
I want to have the book... and the dragon spear.
You offer?
A ton of silver, all of these girls here... also myself.
Money's a nuisance.
And women are as well.
I never bother with either.
- What do you want?
- A man.
- Who?
- A man with a shoulder scar.
Leave us.
Well, where would I start?
How could I possibly hope to find this man you're after?
I know you couldn't.
That's why I'm leaving.
Hold it!
Without permission, no one's ever left this place alive.
Well, there's a first time for everything.
Come on!
I've come to help.
Friend, I'm Fong Sie Pin.
I'm of Ere May clan.
I had an idea that you might be walking into an ambush.
I didn't want to see you dead, so I thought I'd help out.
That's garbage!
Thought you'd help.
What you're really after is the book.
Listen.
I am interested in the book.
I won't deny that.
But I also know I'm no match for you in fighting... so I'm not going to try and get it.
I hope that you can solve the mystery of the missing eight masters.
I'll take my leave.
I don't believe a word he said.
The hypocrite!
- You quite like name calling.
- You...
Well, I could call you a few.
Dad, we've no connection with the Shaolin masters.
So then why are we so interested in their old book?
Daughter, a book like that could be invaluable.
Whoever has the book could control the kung fu world.
That's for sure.
Our Flying Tiger clan should have the book.
Daughter, you have to handle Su... and get the book from him.
I don't want to handle him.
I just need a little bit of cash to see me through the day.
And if you help me, the gods will surely smile on you.
Master.
That was quite a good act that you put on.
Master, you were too rough then.
You really hurt my hand there.
It still aches.
How's the teacher?
He's all right.
He's about the same.
- Teacher, my respects, sir.
- Tell me, how's the plan going?
Quite well. All of the various clans are showing interest.
They'd all like to get hold of the book.
That means things will be more difficult.
- So in future, be extra careful.
- Yes, I will.
And from now on, you'd better not come here again... unless it's extremely urgent.
Yes, teacher.
Su Yin Fong, I told you that you were going to be seeing us again.
Well, so you did.
What do you want?
We've brought along the famous fighter Sing Chu.
If you want to live, then you hand over that book.
Then we might spare you.
If you want to live, then get the hell out of here.
- And I might just spare you.
- Right.
Damn you.
Seems you need a lesson.
You really good?
Well now, you just can't match this.
Now get out of here!
Well now, it seems that I'm really in luck.
I've brought along a treasured golden peacock of our clan... that's it there... and myself.
That's a very handsome offer.
You sure you mean it?
I told you.
I've just got to have that book.
I must solve the mystery about my father's disappearance.
Oh, I see.
And so you'd be really willing... to sacrifice yourself?
Well, I've made the offer.
You going to accept it?
Only a fool would turn that one down.
- You...
- Only one conclusion...
I guess I must be a fool.
Sorry, but it's no deal.
Nobody's getting that book from me.
Beggar man, come out.
That's bad. That's very bad.
Why's it bad?
That's obvious. You can't turn down such a pretty girl.
Then what chance have I got?
What? You still after the book?
Now come on. No sarcasm now.
No need.
But can you tell me, though, if the Shaolin masters are still alive?
And the dragon spear, where's that?
- Can't tell you now.
- When can you say?
- Only when the time is right.
- You're not being very helpful.
I don't intend to be.
So please, leave.
Leave, now.
I greet you, sir, my lord Chien.
Listen, the Lady Suon has just been killed by Su Yin Fong.
So send somebody to take care of him immediately.
Yes. Right away, sir.
Look, no matter what the price may be...
I've gotta have that book.
So make sure I do.
Sir.
Why'd you follow me?
Well, anybody can come here.
It's not a private place.
Are all the Flying Tiger clan like you, so stubborn?
You-You...
How did you know that was my clan?
I not only know that that's your clan...
I also know that you're the daughter of the chief.
When did you find out?
It was on the night
I found out that you were a girl.
That simple.
Only a Flying Tiger would be wearing a tiger hairpin.
You... Just a guess.
It wasn't a guess. It was smart.
And smart people live longer.
Fong Sie Pin.
Damn you! I'll kill you!
- You hurt bad?
- No. They're from Black Dragon clan.
You're the one that killed Lady Suon.
That's right. Listen.
Take my advice. You better get the hell out of here before I lose my temper.
Or else you're gonna die here.
Is that so?
You really think you're good?
Right!
- Let's go! Come on! Go!
- Hey, come back here and fight!
Get some medicine.
I'll take him to the house.
- Right.
- Thanks.
You rest now. We'll have some medicine here pretty soon.
All right, I will.
Thanks a lot.
Not at all. You helped me once.
Listen. Why were those men after you?
I was trying to help you and to stop them from getting the book.
I guess they must've found out.
And so they went for me.
Listen, you rest now.
So it's you again.
We're Black Dragons. We never give up. Not till we've finished.
All right.
This time I'll finish you.
Su Yin Fong, I know you good.
But still, I mean, you're all alone here now.
I think this old house is gonna become your tomb!
Right!
- Now.
- Forget me! Get going!
Nobody leaves.
Is that so? Well, I'm gonna have to prove you wrong.
You...
Fong Sie Pin, you...
Our friend was quite right... when he said the Black Dragon clan never give up.
They certainly don't.
You, you're not Ere May clan?
I'm an old member of the Black Dragon clan.
I should have known it.
You were just too nice a guy to be true.
Well, you may be a pretty smart fellow... but still, you're just no match at all for us.
But still, though...
I'm not dead yet.
Su Yin Fong, if you hand over the book to us peacefully...
I promise we won't take your life.
Is that so?
To get that book, you're gonna have to kill me first.
Don't be stupid.
You don't have any chance.
My God, it's the Tangs!
Damn you! What do you want?
- I want him.
- You're crazy!
Let him go!
Thank you, miss.
Why didn't you take the book when you could?
I believe that you will give it to me.
It will tell me what's happened to my father, won't it?
You seem sure of me.
You're the first man who hasn't flattered me.
Is that the only reason?
You mean that isn't enough?
Now look, I have a difficult job to do.
As soon as I can talk, you'll be the first to know.
I can accept that.
In that case,
I'll wait here with you.
- You got Su Yin Fong here, right?
- You're wrong.
- I'll go in.
- You can't!
Get back!
Hold it!
- Who are you?
- I'm Hong Tu.
- Now where is Su Yin Fong?
- Don't know.
Don't know?
I found these in the bodies of the Black Dragon men.
And they're your clans, and only yours. So don't lie.
And what is Su Yin Fong to you?
My business.
Come on. Hand him over.
If you don't, I'll burn this place to the ground.
Well, you can try it.
And I will. Who'll stop me?
Stop fighting.
You're alive!
- They do this?
- Not them.
- Hurt much?
- Not much.
My friend.
There you are.
Hey, if you hadn't interfered... then these two girls might well have killed each other.
- So tell me. Why are you here?
- That's how it is.
When you disappeared, we all got worried.
If you died, well, nobody would care too much about that.
But the book, though, now that's different.
Come on. Let's go.
We can go to my home. Come.
He's not leaving here.
Now look, the others may be scared of you, but I'm not, though.
Good!
Well spoken.
You are a real Flying Tiger.
Dad, glad you came.
I was getting worried.
No need. Nobody dare harm you.
It's the leader of the clan himself.
- Honored, honored.
- Look, old man.
You want to fight?
Then just say the word.
Dad, now forget about him.
Have a look at Su's wounds.
Don't worry. He's all right.
Hey, hey, stop fighting.
That's enough. That's enough.
Now look. All of us have the same intentions.
- So there's no need for us to fight.
- What do you propose?
Well, I think we can all be frank now.
We're all after that book that this young fella has got...
The Eight Steps of the Snake and the Crane.
So let's get his wounds healed first, and then we can get hold of the book.
- All right?
- All right.
I'll take a look at his wounds.
Dad!
Don't move, or he dies!
Goddamn it!
Wong Yi Fu, you're a crafty swine.
Sure I am.
And that's why I'm a chief.
Now go, or else nobody's gonna get the book.
Dad, please let him go.
Daughter, be quiet. Follow me.
Hey, we're all in this together now.
So you follow them, and I'll go and get help... and we'll meet in the mountains tomorrow.
Dad, don't treat him like that.
After all, he's been hurt.
Look, let me handle this.
Just be quiet.
All right, now where's the book?
What? What's all this?
Look, my friend,
I'm not stupid.
I mean, do you think
I'd carry the book around?
Where's the real book?
Where's it hidden?
Go to hell.
Well, all right.
You can starve a while.
- Lock him up!
- Sir!
Dad, please let him go.
He's been hurt.
He'll die if you starve him.
I'll release him... when he gives me that book... but not before.
Good day.
- Where are they?
- Temple.
Which temple?
Hillside.
- And who is this?
- Well, miss, this is Old Lu.
He's a pretty hefty fella, but he thinks and acts like a kid.
What is all this?
You drag me out of my warm bed... and tell me we have to go and save someone.
- Just who is this, though?
- No, no, that's none of your business.
But this man is of the utmost importance to all of us.
- That right?
- Well, that's something.
But at least tell me who are we saving him from?
Now, look, stop asking questions.
You just have to follow me.
Now listen.
I'm scared of nobody... except for the clan leader
Mr. Wong... the Flying Tiger clan.
So don't you trick me into saving him.
Now don't you worry. Come on.
Hey, what is this?
It's some food.
I brought it for Su.
Your father said no food.
Don't disobey him.
Uncle, you always liked me.
Please let him have it.
Father will never know.
Daughter!
Dad, please don't do this!
Give him some food!
Get out!
Mr. Wong, don't be so cruel.
Cruel people die young.
You give me the book, or it's you who will die.
That's all right.
I'm not cruel.
What's more, I'm a lucky guy.
I'll outlive you.
Well, we'll see.
Come on! Get 'em!
Hey, you take that side.
All right, you.
You won't leave alive.
Well, don't you worry.
I've no intention of leaving.
No! No, please, please, don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me! No, please!
- Please!
- Watch him!
Don't worry. We won't desert you.
Listen, Wong.
If you hurt Su Yin Fong or my friend... my clan will fight you to the end.
I knew that when I started all this!
Now, look, there's no use talking.
Just fight and wipe them out.
No. The odds are against us.
We'll surround the place, and then we'll play a waiting game.
Look, friend, we're going.
That's right.
Damn you!
You let me out of this place!
Let's fight again!
Damn it, I'll show you!
- You watch them.
- Sir!
- See they don't escape.
- Sir.
Hey, wait! Hey, wait!
Goddamn it!
Come on! Let's fight!
Dumb bastards!
Cut it out. Don't curse.
Hey, kid, who are you?
I'm Su Yin Fong.
Oh, I know you. You're the one that we came here to save.
That's right. You surprised?
Oh, that bastard.
That's why he was so secretive.
He said it was somebody important, and it turned out to be some kid.
I'm not important.
But still, I do have the book.
That's extremely important.
What book is that?
You don't know?
Of course not. Why would I ask?
- Be careful.
- Sir.
The book of the masters?
Goddamn that old bastard.
No wonder he wouldn't tell me the truth. He wanted the book himself.
Hey! Listen.
Sorry. Give me the book.
If I was carrying the book, wouldn't they have taken it from me?
- All right, where is it?
- Don't know.
- Bastard!
- You let go, or I'll curse you.
Good. Well, you do that. I'd like nothing better than a cursing match.
I'm a real expert.
Shithead! You goddamn stupid son of a bitch!
Good. Very good.
Very good.
I must admit, son of a bitch, that's the best cursing.
You're nearly as good as I am!
You're really my type.
Listen now.
Let's be sworn brothers.
And then we can join up.
Curse together.
We can curse that Black Dragon clan right into hell, all right?
All right, ready.
Now then, let's start.
Ten above, half below.
With this now.
I, Lu Lo Qui, take Su Yin Fong as my sworn brother.
And from now on, if I let him down, then I shall be cursed... cursed to hell... cursed and damned beyond any possible redemption.
Okay, your turn.
What's wrong? You trying to say you're too good for me?
Right.
I, Su Yin Fong, take Lu Lo Qui as my sworn brother. I give my word.
And if I should ever break it, then I'll be damned forever.
- Still outside?
- Yes.
- You watch 'em.
- Right.
Beggar chief, I warn you, try nothing funny.
Right. Mr. Wong, we'll see who's gonna win this little game.
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
There must be a way.
Of course we must, Su Yin Fong.
You think I wanna spend the rest of my life in this goddamn place?
You got a plan?
Now wait. Let me think first.
- Hey, got it!
- Tell me.
Hey, we just have to get hold of the key.
- You stupid?
- Now come on.
You're underestimating me.
Come here.
Doing that sort of thing is the sort of thing I specialize in.
Listen.
- Hey, give me that!
- Go to hell!
Give it to me!
Look, kid, you hand over your money to me... or I'll bust your goddamn head in.
You thievin' bastard. First the book, and now you try and get my money.
- Damn you!
- You give me it!
Here, give me!
Take that!
Take it easy. Not so hard.
It's gotta look real.
Just stick with it. Come on!
- Give it to me!
- Come on! Guards!
He's trying to get my money.
Come on. Help me!
Here, here, hold it for me! Come on.
He's trying to steal my money!
- Please, help!
- Goddamn you!
Come on! Here you are.
Quick, take it!
- Right. Let's help our friends.
- Not me, I won't.
- Why not?
- They're only interested in the book.
They'll give me trouble.
Besides, think about it.
Who got you into this mess?
Right. That old beggar.
He tricked me into this.
Why should I help him?
- Listen, we'll go out through the back.
- Right.
- We're in trouble. They've escaped.
- What?
And so that stupid Lu has run out on me.
That lousy creep, wait till I get my hands on him.
Now listen. To fight each other doesn't help us.
Just helps them.
So why not combine forces... until we can get that book... and can solve the mystery of the masters... and why they suddenly disappeared?
Right.
Still, though, just how are we gonna find Su now?
We've lots of men.
We'll search.
I'm sure we'll find him.
Tell me. Why are you looking for the man with a mark on his shoulder?
Sorry. I can't tell you.
Well, at least not just yet.
Well, I won't press you.
But how do you propose to find this guy?
I checked every one but the Black Dragon chief... and if he isn't the man... then I must confess that I just don't know where to look next.
You want the Black Dragon clan?
That's easy. Right. I'll take you there.
So you're sure Su Yin Fong managed to escape from the Flying Tigers?
Yes, he escaped.
But I have no idea where he is now.
If he's still in the area, we shall find him, all right.
Fo Dong, come here.
Listen!
- The chief's gonna lead us.
- Right!
Listen. The chief's going out.
Hello! Welcome. Come in.
Have a seat there.
What would you like to eat now?
- Wine.
- Good.
Listen, be real careful.
The boss is gonna ambush that convoy in the valley.
That's right. He told me.
And he said that it's pretty important.
That means if something goes wrong... then for sure we'll be in trouble... he'll kill us both.
Don't worry. Stealing that stuff's gonna be a piece of cake.
Goddamn it. I'm always meeting people
I don't want to see.
But I can never find the people I'm looking for.
Don't worry. Who knows? Maybe
Mr. Wong has already found him now.
- That's Black Dragon Fo Dong.
- Where?
With the escort guards.
It's strange.
He's not in the escort business.
Just forget him.
We've got things to do now.
No. Now listen.
The Black Dragon, they're after the book too.
And they wouldn't give up.
- This could be...
- A trap?
What are they up to?
They're out looking for Su, just like we are.
They're gonna stage a holdup... just to lure him out.
They have to travel over the east mountain road.
Listen. You go get Mr. Wong and we'll meet up in the valley.
Right, right.
That's Black Dragon clan.
Come on. Let's go and help.
Hold it.
Wait for the chief to show.
I can't, otherwise they'll be dead.
I'm going in.
Hey, wait!
All of a sudden they've all stopped fighting.
Well now, so you've finally appeared.
Goddamn it.
The whole thing was just a trick.
I must say, the Black Dragon clan are a pretty smart bunch.
Very tricky.
Well, we have to be because you're pretty smart too.
So you planted those men so that we could hear what they were saying.
That's right.
- Goddamn it!
- And where's your chief?
He's been waiting for you two.
We got them, boss.
Are you two gonna surrender... or do I have to make you?
Look, Chien, don't start bragging too soon.
And if you've got the guts, you come and fight me.
You fools.
You must be tired of living.
Damn you.
Listen, I'll go first.
You won't find me that easy.
Hey.
Damn you.
Damn you!
So you've come.
I've been waiting here.
Listen, let's see what's happening.
Right.
Get back. Let me.
Not yet.
That's for my friend now.
Damn it.
This bastard needs a lesson.
You fool.
You're in real trouble.
Hey, Lu, don't die yet.
I got a bone to pick.
So it's you. Don't you leave. There's something I gotta settle with you.
That's good. Convenient.
All the different sect leaders are here.
- I can wipe the whole lot out. Right!
- Come on!
Daughter!
Daughter!
- You go on. I'll handle them.
- Okay.
- Grab him!
- Come on.
Oh, my God. Is she hurt?
- Oh, no!
- Come on!
Daughter? Daughter? Daughter?
- My God!
- Dad.
Sorry.
He beat me.
Daughter?
Damn you! Damn you!
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Now listen. Chien is the one who killed the Shaolin masters.
What?
I'll take you to see a man.
At our meeting in the autumn... after we created the technique... which we called the "Eight Steps of the Snake and the Crane"... one morning we gathered...
in front of the tomb...
so we could discuss all the details...
of the new technique.
Suddenly after we'd all had a drink from the fountain there...
we then realized someone had been there...
and put poison in the water.
By the time we realized it, it was too late.
And then suddenly, a masked man appeared...
and attacked us all.
My life was saved by Su Yin Fong... but the killer escaped then.
Su stayed with me here... and I taught him the Crane and the Snake style.
Because the killer was masked...
I guessed that he was probably somebody that we all knew.
So I stayed in hiding, and I sent Su out.
Told him to pretend that he had the book... to trap the killer.
And the way things turned out... it seems that my plan worked just like I thought.
Master, we know now that the murderer was Chien.
So what we'll do is to combine and wipe him and all his clan out.
Buddha bless you.
That way would cost many innocent lives.
I will use a nine dragon spear... to call the Shaolin clans in to meet here... and invite Chien to come here to fight a duel.
Settle things once and for all.
One at a time or all at once?
Listen, Chien, we intend to be fair.
And we have agreed you will fight only one man.
And if you win, then you'll be free to leave.
But if you lose, then you must retire to Shaolin... and then stay there and repent all of your sins... for the rest of your life.
I accept that. But I've beaten most of the people here.
Who do you have who could possibly beat me?
Me.
Su Yin Fong, you must be out of your mind.
Listen. You will be careful.
Use all I've taught you... all you've learned.
First, check his weak points.
Please.
I've always been curious to see the Snake and Crane techniques.
He's too tense.
To break through is not so easy.
- His kung fu is very good.
- Really tough.
That's right. In the crutch.
Mr. Chien, well now, ready to talk business?
Right.
I'll pay what you ask for.
No. Afraid the price is doubled now.
Real greedy, aren't you?
Right, I accept.
Fight as a group?
Take the lead.
All together!
A tough job?
You've earned your money.
Well, my friend...
I reckon you must be about exhausted.
And I've seen your techniques.
You won't be any trouble now.
- What's that?
- Snake and Crane.
Really?
You leave it.
Damn you!
You!
Buddha bless you.

I did not fly all the way from New York City... to wherever the fuck we are to get on that.
How many vacations have you enjoyed?
You wanted to try something new.
Tell me, how new does that look?
It's got a fucking chimney, Anthony.
It's a funnel. Honey, we're here now.
Let's just try and enjoy it.
I only agreed to this if it had a fully-equipped gym.
They do.
That I was assured of.
Welcome aboard, professor.
- I'm not actually a professor.
That's not what I hear.
Thank you very much.
I'm your captain. Call me captain.
- You're a real captain, captain?
Madam?
I'm not interested in shaking
Blackbeard's hook.
Would you show my wife to her quarters, please?
Of course, professor.
What's with the finger snapping?
- Don't get all ltalian on me, Peppe.
I don't like finger snapping.
The clients expect finger snapping from the captain.
Giuseppe will show you to your room.
This is your cabin, sir. Madam.
What you can't fit, keep in my room.
- We'll make do. Thanks.
That should be all.
My name is Giuseppe. Peppe for short.
I am the fisherman, but if you need anything, I'm your man.
Ask him about the gym.
Would you show my wife the gym, please?
- Certainly.
What was that screaming about?
What happened?
- She's crazy.
What was that screaming?
- Wait here.
I thought she would like me bringing the gym to her.
I wasn't very happy. What kind of a gym could you possibly carry?
Then what?
- I showed her the gym.
He showed me the gym.
- And?
And?
Your gym. She started screaming.
- I was understanding.
Anthony!
So then... that little hairy black one pulled out a rope... and told me I could jump over it.
- For jumping.
Jump, jump.
She said she was going to hang you with it, captain.
Me?
This is a good idea.
A trip from ltaly to Greece.
It's Greece to ltaly, babe.
Have you seen the deserted islands we can visit?
You cannot do that in the Caribbean.
What would you do on a deserted island, Debi?
I'll think of something.
What?
What "what"?
What is it that you're going to think of?
You lost me.
And here he is.
Nice outfit, pal. Very native.
- Thanks.
What have you come as? Popeye?
- There's no need for that, darling.
I like this outfit. Very Errol Flynn.
- Very Errol Flynn.
Who's Errol Flynn?
I thought we agreed to get dressed up for dinner.
You put us on a boat built for pirates, can we not dress like one?
I changed my mind. I wanted to be a little more comfortable.
Where does that leave me?
And our guests?
Where would we all be if we just did things because we felt like it?
On vacation?
She's a piece of work, that woman.
Why speak Greek? I look Greek?
- You look like an idiot.
Tony's not had much holidays.
- Look after that fucking woman.
Watch your mouth.
Remember what you're getting paid.
It was you that asked me to help you.
I can live without money.
I was happy as I was.
Happy? Happy is nice.
But how much does happy pay?
Now you're talking.
It's not going to rain, madam.
Is that a joke?
Come on in. It's clean as a whistle.
- Depends on who's been blowing it.
Don't bother coming in.
It's really wet. Where's Debi?
Maybe she drowned.
- Did anyone ask if she could swim?
Salty!
Put a mask on and swim with the fishes.
You'll enjoy it.
Why?
Because it's nice.
When you have some time off,
I suggest you swim with the fishes.
Fish is the plural for fish.
Do something about Marina and Amber.
They're ripping Debi to shreds.
What can I do? You know what they're like.
Besides, she's not the sharpest... quickest....
She's stupid, isn't she, Todd?
- Well, she's....
She's unaware of what they're doing.
- Be nice, Tony. She's only 14.
Don't give me that white liberal shit.
It's the nature of capitalism.
Don't give me that white liberal shit.
It's the nature of capitalism.
It's more successful than communism.
You don't see people emigrating to Cuba.
There are problems raised by capitalism.
- What problems?
Your old man's the boss of a pharmaceutical company.
He's got to make a profit to keep the shareholders happy.
That's not in the public's best interest.
- Then they don't have to buy. lmagine there's a drug that can cure a certain kind of blindness.
Even though it costs nothing to make it... they still put a high price on it.
Capitalism.
So if you can't afford the drug, you'll stay blind.
Without the drug companies, they'd stay blind.
What's to stop them getting a job and buying the drug?
They're blind.
- So what?
Limits their employment opportunities.
- They can bake cakes.
You don't need eyes to bake cakes.
But it does raise an ethical question.
- The laws of capitalism are:
The proprietor of goods can set any price he sees fit... and shall not be at the mercy of any moral or ethical issues.
Whose quote is that?
Mine.
I can't see you baking too many cakes.
She's without a heartbeat.
She's a lizard.
Stop moaning.
You're not married to her.
A lizard. One that should be made into a bag, belt and boots!
Guido!
Peppe?
Yes, sir?
- Sir is madam. Water and towel.
Yes, madam.
- And Pee Pee, I want it cold.
Understand? Not cool.
Cold.
As cold as the blood in your veins.
I'm bored.
- I know it. What are we gonna do?
Just have a martini, pop a pill and fuck my husband.
Everyone else does.
Have you no dignity?
What's that?
What?
- That.
It's a jug.
- It's a coffeepot, actually.
What's in the coffeepot, Pee Pee?
Coffee, madam.
- Reheated coffee?
Yes.
- What am I supposed to do with that?
Drink it?
It's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it then, Todd?
Who's paying whom to do what around here?
Say something, Anthony.
- Would you accommodate my wife, please?
Accommodate? Does this mean live in my cabin, sir?
Is this what you mean?
- I think that was a joke.
He's being rude, Anthony.
- Let me deal with this.
Would you please make my wife a fresh pot of coffee, Mr. Esposito?
Certainly, professor.
I'm going to kill that fucking bitch with a kitchen knife!
You surprise me. You told me that a real man's duty is to preserve his dignity.
That's why I'm going to kill the fucking bitch with a kitchen knife!
If she's so much of a problem, stay away from her.
Easy for you to say!
She's not hunting you down.
Everywhere I turn, there she is!
I feel like... a lame gazelle stalked by the eyes of an angry leopard!
Very theatrical.
Now, clean the boiler.
The advantages of chemicals are all around us.
Do we have to listen to that again?
We were playing for $20, and now... it's 4000?
- You don't think I'm good for it?
Can't you control your wife?
- Can't you control yours?
It's changed the atmosphere.
- You're Mr. Moneybags.
I am on vacation.
Stop being such a pussy, Michael.
If you haven't got money,
I'll take jewellery and shoes.
I fold. I have no interest in playing
"get fucked quick" with Imelda Marcos here.
Guido!
When you've put that reptile down, can you empty the ashtrays?
Thank you.
- So go on. Chemicals. Advantages.
Where would we be without fertilizers and pesticides?
Ask Peppe. He was a fisherman until pollution put an end to that.
Pollution is so terrible.
- God. This isn't a sad story, is it?
Ask him what he thinks.
- Nothing wrong with chemicals.
What do you think about pesticides?
- Whatever.
Let him get on with his job.
- Come on. You gotta have an opinion.
If it's man-made, I don't trust it.
You can't cut corners with nature.
Chemicals has made life easier, but easier doesn't mean better.
Money corrupts principles. You can't see clearly when money is involved.
Not money and principles.
Now, this is interesting. Go on.
Chemicals has made a few people very rich.
But as they say, no such thing as a free lunch. Pay now or pay later.
When you pay later, you don't know the interest charged... and who's gonna pay it.
Very good.
- Yes, very good.
Thank you, nature boy. Now, could you please empty the ashtray?
If it weren't so hot, I'd go swimming.
- You wouldn't. The water would be too cold.
I can't eat this.
- What's wrong with it?
Nature boy!
You! Pee Pee!
Yes, madam?
- This fish is bad. It's off.
Bad?
In that case, if you don't want to eat it, you probably want to wear it!
Now it doesn't look so bad, madam.
You blinded me!
- Now you can bake the cakes.
Anthony! Help me!
- Sit down, rich boy... or you'll need all the drugs you got to ease the pain I have for you.
Shut up! Tell it to the fishes.
- Help me!
Now Peppe is in charge.
You listening to me, nature boy?
Yes.
- Why are you serving bad fish?
She needs a doctor!
A checkup from the neck up!
Shut up and take this.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
You made it bad.
You take it up!
What did you say?
- You take it up!
No. The other bit. The bad bit.
What did she say? In English.
- She said the fishes is bad.
Bad?
Tastes okay.
- Of course.
Never mind. Cook another one.
Why?
- Because they're rich... and all rich people are the same.
They play little games. I see it all the time.
Don't react. They get bored, and they change the game.
Our job is to smile.... Like idiots.
The chef is sorry the fishes wasn't so good. He's cooking new fishes.
Are we being punished because we're rich?
No, madam. I love money.
If you weren't rich, you wouldn't be here.
No punishment here.
We love you.
And we love your money more.
That's it, Greek idiot.
Smile.
Happy birthday, Mrs. Marina.
You look gorgeous.
It's always good to see you.
- The pleasure is all mine.
Professor, welcome back.
- I'm not a professor.
Of course you are.
Did you have a good time?
Let me help you.
- Thank you.
Are those ruins old?
- Yes.
All right. I've got it.
All right. I've got it.
Did you have a nice day?
- Yes, I did. Thank you.
I bought some fresh fish.
Peppe always catches the fishes for us.
- I don't care about Giuseppe's fish!
What she said? What's the fucking bitch complaining about now?
Did one of your crew members just swear in front of me?
No, no. You mean "fuking"?
This is the ltalian name of the fishes.
He doesn't think it's very good.
"Fuking" is a fish?
- Yes.
I don't care if it's fuking, puking or a fucking kung fu king!
I want that fish, and I want it tonight.
Okay, madam.
- Thank you.
Fucking, puking, fucking good cooking
I want her on my table tonight
Shut up, idiot.
I can't cook that.
These fishes are beneath me.
This is fishes?
Where did you get...?
Cook Peppe's fishes instead... and pretend it's their fishes.
Got that?
Now, that's what I call fish.
- Yes.
Here's to the fishes.
- Hear, hear.
It's really good.
Isn't it, Michael?
Yes, it is. It's delicious.
It's just right. Great job.
- Thank you.
It tastes just like chicken.
We can do without nature boy's fish from now on. I'll be in charge of fish buying.
That's okay, madam.
That's disgusting.
- Really?
I think it's beautiful.
Why are you haunting our corridors with Ms. Beautiful?
The crew still wants my fishes.
I'm taking it to the kitchen.
I hope I haven't hurt your feelings.
- Feelings?
Let us leave my feelings out of this.
- Don't be so touchy.
-Can't we just get along?
-No, madam. We cannot.
I see you have your dancing shoes on.
One, two. One, two, three.
Please, madam.
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna dance with me?
I don't wanna dance with people
I don't like.
Wine.
Grapefruit juice, madam.
- Thank you.
Do you have children, Pee Pee... or just the mind of a child?
What?
- That cartoon you're wearing.
You requested us to change our T-shirts.
You T-shirt offends me. It's revolting.
Change it.
Subtle.
- Shut up, you old drunk.
Going to bed?
I'll be there in a minute.
- Good night.
Aren't you playing?
- Imelda cleaned me out.
I'm coming with you.
We can tuck up together.
Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Like he said.
What are they up to now?
- The husbands went to bed... while the wives stay up playing cards and drinking.
What kind of husbands are they?
They got everything the wrong way around.
Look what the brunette left in the bathroom. I think it's cocaine.
Let me show you how to take it.
Hold on, captain.
I bet it's something the professor made in his lab.
Flies you to the moon in minutes!
- I've never been to the moon.
What's wrong with you?
You're the captain.
How will we make it to ltaly if you go to the moon?
Go to bed! I'll forget you lost control. Go!
Fuck you. We could have gone to the moon and had an orgy.
I don't want to have an orgy with you.
Go to bed, idiot.
You've lost your mind at the thought of taking it.
Rack 'em up, ladies.
I'm out.
I'm going up for air.
Where is everybody?
They went to the caves with the dinghy.
Why didn't they tell me?
- I know why.
Guido. Lower the other one.
I wanna go to the caves.
It's too late.
- I'll be the judge of that.
There is a current, and the weather could changes.
So what?
The caves are not so close.
My advice is to don't go.
Really? My advice to you is to get the fucking dinghy down.
It's all the same to me, but it's getting late... and it's a long journey.
- We'll manage.
I have warned you.
What's the matter? Are you scared?
- Scared?
I was conceived on the crest of a wave and born in a boat.
What is the meaning of "scared"?
Is this another one of your jokes?
Let's start the engine, shall we?
This engine is a little touchy.
- I can show you touchy.
Now, start the engine.
Number one: My name is Peppe.
Not Guido or Pee Pee!
Number two: I can't start an engine that doesn't want to be started.
Can we stick to one language?
I'll take the engine that runs your mouth.
Then we wouldn't have any problems.
Do we have enough gas?
- Yes.
We have... gas.
- We'll just wait, then.
I'm sure they won't be long.
Aren't we going too far out?
- I warned you about the current.
Give me your sweater.
Jesus!
What've you been doing in that?
- I'm a fisherman, and it's my sweater.
I go fishing in it.
So it smells of fishes.
Fascinating.
If they were coming, they would have passed us.
Maybe they decided to go around the island.
It's not funny anymore!
I want to go back to the yacht.
We can't go back just because you want us to.
We must be rescued or fix the engine.
- Fix it, then!
Great.
Look at this mess I'm in.
Why has this happened to me?
Oh, God. Peppe?
Giuseppe?
Mr. Esposito? Mr. Esposito!
You miss me?
I wanted...
I wanted to know if a storm was coming.
I can't see land anymore.
Why haven't they come for me?
The sea is big.
It could take a while.
A while. What's a while?
There must be something in this plastic bath toy.
I can't believe you came out here without a cell phone!
What the fuck is this, Popeye?
A submarine?
Be careful. Don't shoot.
Why do you have a gun?
- It's a flare gun.
A flare gun?
Hiding anything else?
This isn't my boat. Give it to me.
- No.
Where is God when you need him?
What are you doing?
Trying to save us from dying of thirst and hunger.
What?
- Eat it.
Can't you wrap it in rice or something?
Here's a bit of salt.
How is that?
It's disgusting!
Why did you do that?
I could have eaten it myself!
It took me hours to catch!
Calm down.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Besides, fasting is good for you.
It's a spiritual thing.
Spirits?
Are you serious? We're not fasting.
We are fucking starving!
Don't you swear at me.
Oh, my God!
God. Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Come on, shoot! Shoot!
Give it to me.
- I know what I'm doing! Get off me!
At least we won't die of thirst!
- Great. We'll just drown instead!
Land!
Wake up, Guido!
Land! Land!
Paddle! Paddle!
Don't rush. You'll hurt yourself.
Forgive me for being in a rush to get to civilization.
I can't believe I found land.
The adventure is over.
The adventure is just starting for you, my friend!
Wait till my lawyer speaks to your captain.
What's wrong, madam?
We're saved, you should be happy.
"Madam," is it now?
Changed our tune now that we're on land, haven't we?
Wait here while I look around.
- So you can forget about me?
No chance, sailor.
I'm afraid your lawyer will have to wait!
What? I can't hear you!
No lawyers here!
Where there's a phone, there's a lawyer!
No phones either!
Why?
Because we have landed on a deserted island!
Deserted?
Nothing. No lawyers. No phones.
No gyms. Nothing.
That's impossible, you idiot.
It's not 1 492, for God's sake.
Just call me an idiot one more time...
You're wrong!
I am not a child.
If I say it's deserted, it's deserted.
I don't believe you.
- It's a fact.
My ass. Where there is life, there are people.
Not here. There are many little deserted islands around here.
Get up there and check again!
No. I had a good look before.
- It's not your place to argue with me.
You fucked up the engine. Got us lost.
Made me sink the dinghy.
You can't navigate!
Fuck it! I can't reason with a hairy, black midget.
What did you call me?
- Nothing.
I want to know what you said.
- Nothing.
Did you call me a midget?
- No.
So, what did you call me?
I called you a hairy, black midget!
Your tongue has the grace of the gutter.
Watch your mouth!
- You threatening me?
Fucking right. Listen carefully,
Mrs. I-have-a-big-time-drug-baron-husband.
I'm fed up! I do what I like, and you do what you like.
Now, fuck off!
- Oh, boy.
You are gonna regret this.
- Fuck yourself!
Dig a deeper grave!
- Fuck yourself, bitch!
Come on! Give me more! More!
- Slut!
What did you call me?
- A whore, a slut!
You are a mongrel dog!
A hybrid of something dark, disgusting and tiny!
Let the rich bitch look after herself!
Now her mongrel dog leaves her side!
Let the dog leave his mistress!
And watch him get lost.
Could be worse.
Not so smug now, are you?
I'll have you arrested.
By whom? The sand police?
If you keep being so polite, you'll force me to give you all my fishes.
I can see you are a very clever woman.
Is there anything else I can do for you while I'm waiting to get arrested?
Sell me that fish.
- What?
I want that fish.
Fuck off and bother some other poor shipwrecked sailor.
I'll give you $100.
Two hundred.
Okay, I'll give you $500 for just half of the fish.
If you are hungry, bake a cake.
This is my final offer. I'll give you
$1000 and my gold bracelet.
Take it. Okay?
Now, give me some fish.
I'm not interested. There are some things in life that can't be bought.
And this fishes is one of them.
But I'm hurt! And I need to eat!
Ten thousand fucking dollars!
Let me quote the laws of capitalism, madam:
"The proprietor of goods can set any price that he sees fit... and should not be at the mercy of any moral issues."
Give me some fucking fish, you scumbag!
Number one:
Don't ever insult me again.
Number two: I am the boss now.
Number three: If you want food, you earn it.
Number four: You will wash my clothes.
You can't hit a woman, you fucking lunatic!
Don't forget number one!
From now on, "fishes" is the plural for fishes.
If you are back within one hour with my clothes cleaned...
I shall consider fishes for you.
- Can I have something to eat first?
Do you give drugs to the needy before they've paid?
We don't accept credit in this house either.
And number six: Call me Mr. Esposito.
No. Call me master.
Yes, call me master.
Come on!
- Go. Go. Go! Wash!
Where will I find a washing machine on a deserted island?
That's not my problem.
Frightened?
Mr. Esposito, you're completely taking advantage of me.
Of course I am. I'm now the master.
Fucking peasant.
I want you to say, "Thank you, master, for the privilege of washing your clothes."
Thank you... master... for letting me wash your clothes.
Where do you think you're going?
- I need to eat!
Who is this Peppe?
Get in line, woman.
I want this bottle filled with water.
And be quick about it.
What?
- Yes, master.
Bravo.
Where are you going?
Wait! How about an answer?
Please, wait for me!
A roof. Thank God.
And a bed. I'm saved.
What are you doing, Mr. Esposito?
I mean, master.
Please don't leave me outside.
It's cold. I won't survive another night.
I'm not an animal!
What do you want?
Do you want to share my bed?
What kind of person are you?
You wish to corrupt me.
I am the master and you're my slave!
Don't flatter yourself.
- Pigs keep warm with leaves.
Pigs! I would rather fuck a pig than kiss you, monkey boy.
You forget yourself again, woman.
Let the chill of the night wrestle the last of the beast from you.
Wakey, wakey.
I want my room cleaned by the time I return.
By the time I return.
It's still flopping.
Quick, woman!
The fishes are getting away!
I'm trying, master.
- Work harder! Harder!
I'm not a fucking donkey.
Master.
What?
If you're decent to me,
I'll make sure you get rewarded.
Money?
- If you like.
You insult me.
You offer money you didn't work for.
At least a whore works for her bread.
And one other thing.
How do you know they will rescue us?
We might spend years on this island.
I'd kill myself.
- Go ahead.
I can feast on you for a week.
But as long as you breathe, you work.
Go get some wood!
Why do you keep assaulting me?
The party is over.
You wait on me now. Move!
You're hurting me.
- Move.
But first, kiss the master's hand.
- What?
Kiss it. Kiss it!
You will be punished when you disobey.
Like you did to me.
You made me spit blood! Yesterday you still called me disgusting names.
Kiss the master's hand.
Kiss it.
Or leave! It's your decision.
But if you leave, you leave forever!
Accept my terms or the terms of nature!
Hand! Kiss it!
What are you doing?
- Quick, woman, take this!
Take what?
Don't be an idiot!
Take the octopus.
What are you doing?
Sorry... master.
Your water.
- Why are you sitting down?
Why not? I've worked and I've earned it.
- I want to be waited on.
Did you ever invite me to your table on the boat?
Now it's time to serve me.
This fucking lady. "The juice is warm.
The coffee's old.
The fishes is bad.
I want food, I'm hungry."
Remember the abuse I took from you?
You despise us.
"Sweaty T-shirts, disgusting."
Go on, impress me.
Give me grapefruit juice.
Master, please.
- Grapefruit juice, find me some.
Dance for me.
- What?
I said, dance for me.
- There's no music.
Make some. Sing as well.
You are making me angry. Dance!
Sing.
I don't want to hear the sound of dirty cats in alleys. I want singing!
Master?
Mr. Esposito?
That's enough.
You think I'm staring at your ass?
Big deal. As if I would.
What about when you were sprawled out... with all your tits hanging out?
Yes, I said "tits."
As if we didn't exist. Remember?
Of course you do, dirty slut.
Show me your tits now.
Hear me?
Keep on playing deaf, then.
Are you bashful?
Madam is bashful.
How come you were not embarrassed before? Undress!
Filthy pig!
- You're fighting back at last.
Come here. I'll teach you a lesson.
- Let go of me! Let go!
Help!
- Go on, shout. Shout!
Somebody, help!
- She's crying for help. The idiot!
Who's going to help you, id...?
Run, you little vixen. Run.
You rapist! Get off of me, you pig!
You'll pay for everything.
Get off, you pervert! Get off!
Why should I pay for all of life's injustices?
You're obsessed!
- Obsessed with justice.
You maniac! You sex fiend!
Pervert, get off!
What are you doing?
I'm going to destroy you and make you feel what a real man is like.
You have never known a real man.
I hate you, but I like you.
And you know it.
I liked you on the boat.
Come on, say it.
Admit it, come on.
Say it. Confess your burning desire.
Come on. Come on.
Are you saying yes?
Are you saying yes?
Yes. I'm saying yes.
Well, it's no. Because I'm saying no!
You must fall in love!
Head over heels in love!
You're already my slave.
I want you as my love slave.
You'll crawl and beg for mercy.
You will burn with desire.
With passion, like a sickness!
I'll get under your skin. lnto your head.
Your heart. Your belly.
I'm going to be your God!
Is that clear?
You don't know yet who
Giuseppe Esposito is!
Dear Mrs. Amber, you have never looked so happy on the yacht.
Peppe, why aren't you sleeping?
You must call me master.
Call me master.
I'll call you whatever you want me to call you.
Just let me go back to sleep.
Stop it.
You are getting good at this, my princess.
Good. Harder, harder.
Make it tender.
Good.
Tell me, is life better than this in the city?
Why you are so quiet tonight?
Come here.
How can you be sad when you are so beautiful?
I don't believe you.
You'd rather be with a girl, wouldn't you?
Someone younger.
Someone prettier.
- What is it with women?
Always trying to look younger.
Thinner.
Would you really be interested in me if you had a choice?
You don't compete with 1 8-year-olds.
- Who says?
Society says.
Who's in charge of you?
You think about what others think.
You never enjoy the moment.
I don't want a girl.
I'm a man, and a man wants a woman!
Come here!
That's enough. I have to stop that.
What are you gonna do about it?
I wanna fix it.
You're making a mess.
What?
I don't believe it.
- What is it?
Drink it.
- I'm not drinking that. You drink it.
Know your problem? You never had to work, so you're not grateful.
How would you know?
You know nothing about my life.
When I met you, you were a pain in the ass.
Well, maybe I wasn't happy.
Why not? Apparently you had everything.
Maybe what I wanted wasn't what I needed.
Drink.
Bruce Lee.
Charlie Chaplin.
Jesus Christ.
Good game.
Stupid game.
- Your turn.
How many words?
One word.
Big head.
The pope.
Godfather,
Marlon Brando.
What is wrong with you,
Mr. Esposito?
You should learn to sew instead of talk.
I love you.
Fine words.
What if we hadn't been shipwrecked?
You'd still be rich, unhappy American wife.
I would still be a poor, ltalian, happy fisherman.
That was then. This is now.
Is this a fairy tale?
It happened because we are here.
Endless passion here.
I'd love to see Mrs. Amber strolling down Five Avenue with Mr. Esposito.
Go on, picture it.
How much love can you see in that?
What are you doing? What is this?
It's a refrigerator.
Where did you get it?
- I saw it flying by.
Watch your mouth!
I do the jokes around here.
How did you get it? And no funnies.
I got it with a spear.
It's big.
Hey, listen, I catch the fishes.
You cook them.
Fresh eggs?
Gulls' eggs?
Yep.
It's my job to get these eggs.
What have you done to me?
What you needed doing to you.
Don't you like it?
It's okay.
Okay?
Yeah. It's okay.
Run, my little vixen. Run. Run!
Let's hide.
Don't, Peppe.
- Why not?
You say you love me.
I want the whole truth.
What more proof do you need?
I've never been happier in my life.
We were meant to be together, you said so.
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to be tested.
If you love me, you can love me anywhere. I want to know! I have to!
I want to know if a rich man's wife thinks the same.
What difference does it make where we are? Please, let's stay.
I love you.
I need proof.
Then we can do as you say.
But I need to know you can resist.
- Believe me.
You're all that I want.
You're scared, aren't you?
That's why I need proof.
What did you do for food?
We made do.
Mr. Esposito is very clever.
I have to go.
- No, no. Sit down.
You must have something to drink.
- Yes.
You know, you have been on the news for a month.
Excuse me. I have to go down.
Absolutely.
Your husband is on the radio.
He's on his way.
He's coming in by helicopter to meet us at the nearest port... but he wants to talk to you.
The telephone is upstairs.
I will show you.
Over one month on a deserted island... and she is not bad?
Nothing happened?
What kind of
Sicilian fool are you?
You know the whole world has been talking about this?
Her husband is a very rich man.
He's going to reward you.
You picked the right woman to save...
Have another glass of wine!
Mr. Esposito.
I wanna thank you for saving my wife.
She said you were most decent.
Thank you.
Mr. Esposito?
Mr. Esposito? We're very grateful for your assistance and help.
We've provided a room at our hotel for you to recuperate.
Hey Peppe!
Where have you been?
Got my bag?
Give me a room.
Just a minute.
Mr. Esposito?
There is one other thing.
Perhaps we should sit down?
As a reflection of our appreciation, we would like to offer you this.
Get out and take your bribes with you.
- No, it's not a bribe, Mr. Esposito.
What will this buy me?
Mrs. Leighton?
There is a phone call for you.
I'll wait outside.
Madam.
Yes?
It's me.
Why did you take so long to call?
- I have called.
They didn't tell me.
It doesn't matter now.
It doesn't matter if you fail me, because I love you.
I love you,...
I love you more than
I ever thought was possible,...
I didn't think it came as strong as this.
You are once again in charge.
I am yours,
I always will be.
I love you too, my darling.
I love you more than life.
My husband's coming.
Leave a message for me in reception.
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
At 9 a.m., I shall have a boat waiting for us... at the end of Pier 22.
I miss you so much.
Are you on the night shift?
And the morning.
You must give this to Mrs. Leighton.
The blonde lady.
I know who she is.
Only give it to her if she is alone.
Understand? Alone.
Hide it.
Are there any messages for me?
What are you doing, honey?
Why aren't you dressed?
- I was looking for you.
Well, let's go, shall we?
Any messages for us?
Just this.
It's about the helicopter.
I have to make a call.
You should go back up, get changed....
Can I use your phone?
- Certainly, sir.
Honey. Just give this tip to the bellboy, would you?
Honey. The tip.
Thank you, madam.
I think this is for you, sir.
Who gave you this?
The blonde lady.
Mrs. Leighton.
That can't be true.
Her husband gave it to you.
No sir.
It was the lady.
Where is she?

Your Majesty
Long live, Your Majesty chen Lie

I've already read about your letters
You two are still pleading
... for the poorly educated Han people
I just don't understand
... why you're doing this!
Your Majesty
About the case of Jiang Nan Words,
... too many people were involved
The scholar, Lui Liuliang, chief Secretary, cha Zhiting and
Wang Jingqi, the staff of General Liang;
They were punished because of the words they used
That was in accordance with my decree
They were trying to oppose the government
They deserved to die
However, the people in southern china
... are very angry
If we don't tackle the situation in time,
... the consequences could be drastic!
What a great Government Officer!
Yan Lebu
Yes, your Majesty
You're a Manchu
How can you plead for them?
Don't you still want your head?
I'll take the risk to tell you the truth
It's for the sake of ching Dynasty's welfare
I hope that you'll consider our suggestion
I don't care if I lose my life
The Emperor's order is the law
It cannot be changed all the time
How dare you disrespect the emperor!
Don't think that you're from the White Flags
... and I cannot kill you
We're really loyal to your Majesty
Please reconsider our suggestions
Get out!
Please excuse us
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
Pass on my word
Have those two traitors executed
Yes, your Majesty
Your Majesty
I have something to inform you, but I'm not sure if I should
Stop mumbling. Tell me now
Yes, your Majesty. There's a saying... that an Emperor doesn't kill the consultants
If you have them eliminated...
I'm afraid it could arouse trouble!
From what I see...
What is your good opinion?
For the sake of your Majesty's reputation,
I think... we should do it secretly
Yes
Xin Kang
Yes, your majesty
I'll leave it to you
Do a clean job. Got it?
Yes, your Majesty
If there're any mistakes,
... you'll lose your head
Yes, your Majesty
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
How goes the task I gave you?
Your Majesty, chen and Yan are important officers
We have to be very careful
I'm still waiting for the right chance
I wouldn't be kept waiting forever,
I hope?
Sorry, your Majesty
Your Majesty
I have one weapon that can... behead a man 1 00 paces away
The victim will never know what him
What is it called?
The Flying Guillotine
Your Majesty
This is the Flying Guillotine
How can this weapon... take a man's head 1 00 steps away?
This can kill the enemy at the speed of light
Just control this chain
If it catches the enemy's head, a hood will drop down. Pull the chain
... and 3 sharp blades will be triggered
Victims will be beheaded and killed instantly
The Flying Guillotine is really powerful!
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
I want to see how it really works
Yes, your Majesty
Your Majesty
For the Flying Guillotine,
I still can't control it well enough
So I can only shoot it within 4 steps
After I've mastered it,
I can do it beyond 1 00 steps
This weapon is powerful indeed
Once you've mastered it,
I'm afraid even I won't dare sleep at night
This slave wouldn't dare...
I doubt if you'll have the guts
Yes, your majesty
Xin Kang, listen...
At your service
Let Xin Kang be promoted to join the Yellow Flags
From the special agents, choose the 1 2 best imperial guards... and train them to use the Flying Guillotine
Those 1 2 agents have to be loyal to me or I'll kill everybody related to them
For just one traitor, many will be killed
Yes, your Majesty
The Emperor is leaving...
With the spirit of God, we promise to be loyal to your Majesty and be at your service forever;
Even if it means risking our lives
The mountain can be torn down, but our will won't change
If we have second thoughts, we shall kill ourselves
...with no regrets
This oath we take willingly
Xin Kang
Ma Teng
Xu Shuangkun
Xie Tianfu
Luo Peng cha Zhiliang chen Xinyi cheng Ziping
Wang Xiaoliang
Yu Weixiao
Zhao Xueli
Sun Jian
Zhou Zhizhong
Guys, consider yourselves lucky to be the chosen ones
From now on, we must practise the Flying Guillotine hard
With your levels of basic Kung Fu, you will master the weapon in 6 months
Let's start
Release
Practise again
Pull
You're good
That's great!
You have some good moves
You two seem to be the best
But the distance is still too short
Practise again
Yes
An imperial decree from the Emperor
Please listen
By the order of the emperor,
Ma and Xu are awarded with
1 00 taels of gold for doing well with the Flying Guillotine
It's an encouragement for them
Thank the Emperor for his kindness
Mr. Zhang
Mr. Zhang, we just started to practise today
How does the Emperor know about it?
Had he been some ordinary person... how could he be the Emperor?
Xin Kang, be very careful
Brother Xu,
The emperor knows everything
He's like God continue practicing
Hey, everybody!
I think you're all tired
Take a bath and rest for a while
We'll practise again at night
Okay
Let's go
Brother Ma, are you tired?
I'm okay.
Looks like I'm getting used to it
I don't understand why the emperor asks us to learn the Flying Guillotine
That's needless to say
Of course it's for killing the traitors
Who? Who'd dare to betray?
The emperor just needs to give the order
He can kill whomever he wants
Why waste all this effort... to kill people with the Flying Guillotine?
Well, I don't understand either
Reckon, the emperor must have his reasons
Ever since we started practicing,
... we haven't left the palace once
I can' stand it anymore
You little kid, already thinking about women?
What so funny about it?
Oh, come on! I'm not a eunuch
More than a month without ' it ' kills me!
Good...
Keep going...
Quickly...
Keep going...
Quickly...
Good...
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Oh, I understand
You're like me who can't stand the loneliness of the palace, right?
But I haven't met you before!
How can we...
Who are you?
My name is Wanzhu
The emperor sent me to you as a present
The emperor remarked... you're not a eunuch
So instead of sending you gold etc; K he just asked me to wait upon you well
Brother Ma,
... the emperor really knows everything
What did you say?
Tonight, I'll sleep here with you,
I want to talk to you till dawn
Ma Teng
Yes
You do it
Yes
Release
Good...
The Emperor is here...
Rise
Ma Teng
At your service
You're young and capable. Good!
You can aim perfectly in just 4 months
Keep it up. You'll have a bright future
Thank you, your Majesty
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
There's still something
I don't understand
The Flying Guillotine spins in the air
Say if someone gets defensive in advance... the Flying Guillotine won't work, right?
Your Majesty, the Flying Guillotine spins at a very high speed
Anything that hits it... will be driven away by the spinning force
Show me again
Yes, your Majesty
Ma Teng
Yes
Your Majesty,
Even if the enemies use weapons for defence, their Kung Fu can't save them from death
Even if the enemies lie on the floor, the Flying Guillotine can still take their lives
Very good
This thing really seems invincible
You all just keep up the good work & practice
I will give everybody rewards
Thank you, your majesty
Xie Tianfu
Yes, your majesty
So, how was the gift
I sent you last night?
It's my fault. Sorry
How can you be that useless?
Are you really a eunuch, or what?
When I gave you such a good reward, you should enjoy it to its fullest
Don't worry. It's not your fault
Thank you, your Majesty
The Emperor is leaving...
Brother, what happened?
Nothing much
Brother Xu, sorry
Are you blind?
Shit! You wanted to kill me?
No... I didn't do it on purpose
Stop it
Stop fighting... Stop!
Ma Teng, why are you fighting?
My mother gave me this Jade Buddha
He stepped on it;
... which means he disrespects my mom
That's why I have to beat him up
Ah Kun, go back
Who? Who?
Mr. Xin. It's me
Ah Kun, it's you?
I thought it's someone else
What are you doing here at midnight?
My... my purse has gone missing
Maybe you dropped it in the training hall
I'll have a look there come back quickly
Yes, Mr. Xin
You should rest earlier
What are you doing?
I want to meet His Majesty
Search him
Yes
Go in
Your Majesty
Xu Shuangkun is here to see your Majesty
Xu Shuangkun
Why are you here this late?
It's my fault
I met Mr. Xin when I got out
He almost knew the secret
I got myself out with a little trick
What do you have to report to me?
Your Majesty,
I've found Ma Teng having second thoughts
He is planning a rebellion
Ma Teng?
He practiced a lot and improved quickly
How can you tell he's having a second thought?
Well, I've been observing him
He's been acting mysteriously
So I think he must have something in mind
Today, why were you fighting with him?
He almost killed me with the Guillotine
Therefore... you want to take revenge here, right?
This slave wouldn't dare...
I really appreciate Ma Teng's Kung Fu
He will become somebody great later
I'm planning to make good use of him, unless you can prove what you've said
Yes, your Majesty
Go away
Yes
Success!
They've succeeded
A secret decree from the Emperor
Xin Kang shall receive it

The lord's head is gone!
Lord Yen, please don't bother
I'll walk you till here
Master...
Somebody come quickly...
Master...
We've killed two government officers chen Lie and Yan Lebu
Those two officials were loyal and honest
Of course
The whole world knows about it
These two people are brave enough to tell emperor the truth
They saved a lot of scholars
I don't understand... why would the emperor have them killed
I heard that at Mr. Yan's funeral... weeping people lined the streets
They all think these mysterious beheadings... are something unbelievable
Okay. Let's do it like this
You take us as your godsons
We'll be at your service from now on
No. How can l?
Please sit down
We must pay our respects
Kowtow to our godfather
Alright...
Everyone, rise
It's Officer Shi's house
Yes. He's also a good government officer
Why the emperor wants him dead?
Brother Ma, what happened to me?
My hands can't stop shaking
I can't do this
We'll climb up to the top of the wall there
We'll get for sure from the top, let's go
Where's Tianfu?
Xie Tianfu, are you ok? come here come here quickly
Mr. Xin
Tianfu. You do it
I...
Do it...
I can't...I can't do it
I can't kill anymore
I can't be the killer for the emperor
I can't kill anymore
I can't be the killer for the emperor
I can't...
Tianfu, calm down
It's okay. Let's go
I can't kill anymore. I...
Master...
Somebody come quickly
Master was assassinated
Xie was scolding over there
... and insulting the emperor
Godfather
Ah Kun. come over here
Godfather, you look worried
I just got a secret decree from the Emperor
Who is it today?
You read it yourself
Xie Tianfu
I'm afraid...
What's the matter with you?
I had a nightmare
You're just too tired.
I'll get you some tea
Tianfu
Who did it?
Who killed Xie Tianfu and Wanzhu?
Who? Who...
I did
It's you?
You killed Xie Tianfu and Wanzhu
I did
I killed Wanzhu
You're all crazy. All of you
You've lost your mind and soul
Xie Tianfu has been through a lot with us
He's our brother
What actually did he do?
How can you do this to him?
It's the emperor's order. We can't refuse
He asked us to learn the Flying Guillotine
... in order to eliminate betraying officers
I can't believe, our brother
... was killed by the Flying Guillotine
Maybe someday it'll be my turn
... or your turn!
We have taken an oath on our lives
We'll forever be loyal to the emperor
Our heads don't belong to us anymore
So it doesn't matter about our family
Yes, we've lost our mind and family
We're not human
We're just killing tools for the emperor
Killers for the emperor
Xin Kang is here to see your Majesty
Ma Teng offended me and disobeyed me
I order you to execute him
Yes, your Majesty
Wait a minute
Yes, your Majesty
I'm afraid this will affect the morale

Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty

Enough wealth for your lifetime
Thanks for your Majesty's kindness
Everybody talks about Feng Yang
Feng Yang used to be a great place
But since we had a emperor from this place
We had 9 bad years out of 1 0
The rich ones sold their land
Master, you're here. This way, please...
What do you want to eat?
A bottle of wine and a big bowl of noodle
Yes
Everybody talks about Feng Yang
There're disasters every year
The dam was broken and this resulted in floods
Acres of fields have gone under water
Welcome
Please go in, there're seats
Master, here's your noodle
Good...
Master, please spare me a few coins
Master, be kind, spare me a few coins
Thank you
Mister...here is your food and wine
Get out...
Go away chase
Have you seen anyone suspicious?
No
Ma Teng. Follow us back
You can't escape come down
Take him away
Left hand with a gong and right with a drum,
We carry the gong and drum and sing a song
I don't think I can sing other songs,
I just know the tune of Feng Yang Song
Feng Yang Song
Our life is tough. It's really tough
I can't get a good husband in my life
Other's husbands all have a wonderful job
My wife at home has a pair of big feet
It's longer than a foot...
Good...
You're injured!
There's an old temple there.
Let's rest there
Miss, I'm cold. can you start a fire, please?
You lie down here. I'll get you a doctor
Miss
You can't get a doctor here, you can't
But look at you...
I'd rather die here than call a doctor
I understand
Miss, don't go
You've saved me, how can I pay you back?
I wanted to. You don't have repay me
Why were you caught?
Sorry, I can't tell you
See you
Miss
May I know your name?
Sorry, I can't tell you
My surname is Ma. Ma Teng
I know
You know?
Your pictures are everywhere in the city
Everybody knows you
But you're not scared of me...
I'm not. The Emperor nabs people everyday
He only killed the innocent and good folk
Let's go now
This is not a safe place
There're guards everywhere
I'm also injured
Where can I go?
Do you live around here?
I lost my family and I have no home
We can run together
We'll go through this together
I'm not worried about living, wait...
I have a lot of gold
It belongs to the emperor
This is useless
If you expose identity, you still have to die
Don't worry. I know farming
I know how to keep pigs
This gold is useless
VAMPIRE WOMAN
Miss, can I help you?
What do you want?
Madeira, February 22, 1974.
Today is February 22.
I'm just a few hours
Wood and already killed a man.
I wish this curse came to an end after charging for long on the earth.
I am a prisoner of fate burden on the Karlsteins.
An evil force pushes me to commit such heinous crimes.
There, those treacherous islands, where scientists have found Atlantis perhaps, lies the answers the many issues so far eluded us, and that even today, more than ever, concern us and worry us.
If you're there in the middle those volcanic mountains, find the sacred land of
Living God and beings from another world.
Sorry, madam. I am a journalist.
I would grant me an interview.
Thank you. I will not take your time.
Only need to answer yes or no.
First I would like to inform you that the story I'm writing come out in major newspapers and magazines in Europe and America.
I will not take much of your time because I already have the questions ready.
I know it's dumb, but I know also you can hear very well.
You are the Countess Irina Karlstein.
I know that is not married and has children.
I would like to have children?
So to be the last
Karlstein descendant of the family?
The man who came comes from the same country as yours?
He also is silent ... not?
Believes that this deficiency is a consequence of the curse accompanying his family for centuries?
You know the reputation bloody their ancestors.
Your smile makes me think adopting what they did.
Do you feel bad and downward of a family of vampires?
There seems to be a beautiful home your property on the island.
The mountain?
You inherited from your ancestors?
The first Count Karlstein, I suppose.
They say he made some of their crimes on the island.
Know something about these murders?
How? A crime?
The first, then!
You came back here.
Do not say that a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime?
Know of a strange murder committed last night?
It is a complicated case for researchers.
The killer left no clues.
Footprints were found, but they disappear after a few meters.
As if the killer had vanished into thin air.
Heard something about it?
It's time to go.
Do not want to mess up.
So, goodbye.
Thank you for your kindness.
Goodbye, Countess Irina.
See you soon, I hope.
And if you're in the mountains, amid the bustling haze, hear voices lost in the fog surrounding the mountain.
Awake!
Awake!
Will be marked forever for me to find.
I will never forget.
Wake up, Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
-Good evening, inspector.
-Good evening, Dr. Roberts.
-Sit down.
-I finished the autopsy asked.
Therefore, it seems so tired?
-It is a horrible thing.
Horrible?
Autopsy or the body?
It's the dirty work of the autopsy.
But this time I have a surprise.
-He was not dead?
-You are funny today.
He was killed by a mouth.
I 'm the funny here.
Assume that as much as I play.
He was bitten.
During an orgasm.
And a vampire sucked his semen and your life ...
Do not tell me who believes in vampires!
This is not the work of a madman?
A sadist?
Believe what you want.
I will not argue with you.
You can not understand what is happening.
Here is my report.
Goodbye, Inspector.
-Dr. Roberts?
-Yes.
His ideas hang too for fantasy. It is a pity.
And you have no imagination.
Now that's a shame.
Goodbye!
Countess Karlstein?
Oh Sorry!
His secretary told me to go up.
I mean, he wrote me a message.
He is dumb ... I think.
So are you.
I work for the hotel.
The message I received the man who accompanies you need my services, no?
Good evening, Dr. Orloff.
I'm Dr. Roberts.
Hope I'm not disrupt it.
Not at all, Dr. Roberts.
His name is not strange.
But his voice reminds me of someone.
That's because I knew when you were a child.
His father was my best friend and my best teacher.
I came here for a consultation.
I know that he inherited his genius.
Oh, I research.
And sometimes, in darkness, find answers that can not be found in the light.
And do not get the impression that the shadows on this island to approach more and more?
I have this feeling.
And I live here too.
Yes, you're right.
It is a strange place.
I chose to live here.
I have the impression that a crowd surrounds me day and night.
A multitude of strange aspirations, crowd malignant that infects some of the thousands inhabitants of these islands.
You're right, Dr. Roberts.
Death is here and we are concerned.
I ask what is waiting, what you need on this island?
The sources of good and evil.
The forces of evil will awaken.
So the circle closes.
Know the beautiful Countess Karlstein?
I've felt his presence here.
Is she alive?
Are you alive?
Wood has been serious recent cases of vampirism.
And I think that was it.
I found the first books of Panther, accounts of the Countess Karlstein and their murders.
In accordance with Panther it sucked the body of his victims and fed their hormones.
That's all I know.
Do not expect more from me, Dr. Roberts.
You have to take their own conclusions.
Anna ...
Anna ...
Why again my body wants to die?
Why do my senses do not survive without the last breath of a victim?
Why does my soul craves for peace and love if you can not have them?
This woman put the powder the belly of this toy.
And that the drug has crossed the border for many months.
Ah, the good lady ...
I must admit that was a great idea.
-Inspector would like to speak with you.
Of course. Sit down, please.
-See how sexy is this position?
"Come, let us alone!
No one else has a sense of humor.
I'm listening, sir.
I want to know how is the research.
Already put his hands on that sadistic?
The murderer who kills with his mouth?
No. ..
No, not yet.
But it will take.
I doubt it.
Only police is not enough.
As I said, can not be someone normal.
And I am aware that our ideas run in parallel.
Why?
What do you mean?
Well, parallel lines never meet.
If you are saying that our lines never meet, well have to go it alone, to discover the truth.
Council of friend: search a good doctor, a psychiatrist.
Because I can not help it.
You can hear me.
I am sane.
And that murder is surrounded by a mystery hard to unravel.
One day, their bodies will be so strong, to be as entities.
You will know your arrival when the sound of flapping wings is defined as the point tilt your head so much then, unfortunately, you'll find serenity.
And a deep silence reigns around.
These signs that recognize the supreme moment, and you know that entered the world of great mystery, which we all came.
You are the Countess Karlstein?
We've met, right?
Can I sit?
I just finished reading a book very strange and interesting.
I learned many things about this island.
The author thinks it is a point meeting of ghosts and spirits, the inhabitants of the mysterious worlds.
But tell me ... you is not a ghost?
One of those strange beings endowed with magical powers?
I've been in these places.
The atmosphere is quite different.
Do not you think?
You come from there?
You take me with you one day?
Back from the mist?
I was waiting for you.
Thank you for coming.
Follow me, please.
Here. My special guests always sign the gold book.
Here is a previous visitor, Irina.
Take off the girl.
Take off your clothes.
Your skin is so silky
I do not dare touch it.
Continue.
Continue!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
But why?
Why?
And it appeared from the shadows.
A silhouette fiery and unsettled.
That was his image.
As she approached, his body was becoming increasingly real.
Amid the mist, the contours of your face slowly became fluid and undefined.
My eyes met hers.
But that does not surprise me, because I found a world of peace.
That's what I wrote, even before you know or love.
It must be fate.
Good evening, Dr. Roberts.
Two canine pierced lips and distorted the clitoris.
It was the first vampire made.
Sucking the life energy and left the victims without blood.
That is Panthou says in his writings.
What he said is more than terrible.
These devils must die!
And it should be forever.
Why?
The moment of pleasure in our waiting
Valley for a lifetime.
Why go against that?
It's up to you which is not so easy.
Let me.
In the silence that surrounds me ...
I am no longer alone.
It's a new world, because I do not need more than eyes to see.
Pra discover life, true.
Ah, Robert ...
Believe me, your bias is blinding him.
A world of wonders awaits.
It's up to you to be part of it.
What strange house.
Looks like a tomb.
It is the home of his ancestors?
Tap.
I know who you are.
And I understand your fear in bringing me here.
You feel sorry for me.
But it's a terrible feeling.
I know you also felt.
But I do not want your pity.
Because I want to be with you, understand?
I want to be near you.
Follow with you.
Life is not important.
I do not want to be alone.
Even if he had not known,
I would have left this world.
Why? Why?
Yes, that all this time?
This time without end, the hours of wailing and pleasures, of loneliness and fear, the cold coffin forgotten in the depths of the mausoleum.
My relentless fate guided me a wonderful person, also became a victim.
I was his judge and his involuntary performer.
For nothing can stop the march of destiny.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Yes .. I know who you are.
Your mysterious world does not save more secrets for me.
I can feel your desires.
I can even hear your voice.
"The powers of darkness aroused again."
"Another man died tonight."
"I, Irina Karlstein, I will act to all vampires away. "
"I came, Dr. Orloff, because I want to take
My message to humanity. "
"When I called, all vampires return to the shadows and follow, once again, to the worlds of darkness to come to the end to nightmares ghosts and vampires. "
Countess Karlstein.
I would like to talk to her.
I want to see it!
Irina ...
END
And it is told how once...
...the earth swayed in deep quiet...
...swayed in deep silence, r ested in stillness...
...softly r ocking, and lay ther e, lonely and void.
And this is the first testimony...
...the first word.
Ther e was no man...
... nor beast, fowl, fish, crab, tr ee...
...stone, cave, gorge, grass-tuft, nor bush...
Only the heavens wer e ther e. lnvisible was the face of the earth.
Only the seas gather ed under the firmament...
That was all.
Nothing was ther e to take form...
...or become audible...
... nothing to move, trickle...
...or rush under the firmament.
Ther e was only the nothingness.
Only the waters gather ed together...
...only the sea lay calmly ther e, one single surging sea.
Truly nothing was ther e, which might otherwise have existed.
Only the cr eatr ess was ther e and the cr eator...
...the Mighty and Cucumatz,
Herself, the child-bear er...
...and the begetter of sons wer e ther e upon the unfathomable waters.
Omniscient and omnipotent was their essence.
And likewise ther e truly was Heaven...
...and also the ''Heart of Heaven'' ...
...this is the name of the God...
...this is how He is named.
And his word came thither...
... unto the Mighty and to Cucumatz...
...wher e ther e was darkness and night...
...and talked to the Mighty and to Cucumatz.
And they talked and bethought themselves...
...and consider ed car efully, took council among themselves...
...and br ought their words and considerations into accord.
Ther e emerged fr om their plans the dawning of a light...
...and the conception of man.
And then they ponder ed the spr outing, the gr owing of tr ees and cr eepers...
...the springing up of life...
...and the cr eation of mankind in darkness and night.
...on the str ength of Him, who is the ''Heart of Heaven'' ...
...and whose name is Huracan.
Huracan-flash-of-lightning is his first appearance...
...the second is
Tom-thumb-lightning...
...the third, at last, is gr een-lightning.
By these thr ee is the
''Heart of Heaven'' encompassed.
And they came to the Mighty and to Cucumatz...
...and consider ed light and life...
''ln what manner shall life be sown...
...and how shall light shine?
Who shall be our ward and keeper?
O that it may come to pass!
This thou shalt ponder!
Recede o ye waters, abate ye fr om the earth!
Let ther e be earth and her union...
...and she shall become level...
...so that life can be sown...
...so that light shall be in heaven and on earth.
For ther e is no splendor nor r enown, nor glory...
... in this, our work, our cr eation...
... lest man be built, man be cr eated.''
Thus spake they.
And earth was cr eated by them.
Y es indeed, thus it came forth.
So that earth might come forth they said...
...''Earth'', and at once it appear ed.
Mer ely like a cloud, like unto a haze when it first took shape...
... in its first manifestation.
Then the mountains wer e heard rising out of the waters...
...and they wer e majestic instanter.
And Cucumatz r ejoiced...
...''lt was good that thou camest down unto us...
...thou 'Heart of Heaven', thou Huracan...
...thou Tom-thumb-lightning, thou gr een-lightning!''
''Our cr eation and our work will be well-made,'' spake they.
Earth, the mountains, the plains thus came forth.
And everywher e the courses of the rivers wer e set...
They meander ed and wound...
...at the foot of the mountains and between them.
Well-parted the rivers wer e...
...after the high mountains had come forth into light.
Thus came this earth into being.
And further they now thought out the beasts of the mountains...
...the keepers of all for ests, the inhabitants of the mountains...
...the stag, fowl, puma, and jaguar...
...the snake, rattle-snake, and viper, the wards of the cr eepers.
And the child-bear er and the begetter of the sons spake...
''Shall it be all void...
...shall it be all still under the tr ees and cr eepers?
Would not it be wise now...
...to have somebody watch over them?'' spake they...
... bethinking themselves and taking council the one with the other.
At once the stag and the fowl wer e shaped...
...and now they showed the stag and the fowl their habitation...
''Thou, stag, shalt sleep near the course of the river, in the gorges...
... her e thou shalt dwell, betwixt grass-bushels and herbs. ln the for ests shalt thou multiply!
Let it be so !'' they said unto them.
Then the small birds and the big birds r eceived their abode...
''Y e birds of the tr ee-tops and the cr eepers...
... may ye dwell and nest her e !
Her e may ye br eed and multiply on the branches of the tr ees...
...and on the tendrils and cr eepers.''
So it was told to the stags and the fowl.
Thus was the earth haunted by them...
...and each was given his bed and his r esting place. ln this manner, the child-bear er and begetter of sons...
...gave the beasts of the earth their habitation...
...thus all the stags and fowl became alive.
And the stags and fowl wer e told by the cr eatr ess and the cr eator...
... by the child-bear er and the begetter of sons...
''Speak orderly...
...do not clamor or shout without sense...
...speak coher ently...
...everyone in his manner...
...everyone after his family...
...everyone after his kind.''
However, it came to pass that they spake...
... not as human beings would.
When the cr eatr ess and cr eator heard...
...that they failed to speak as human beings do...
...they said to each other...
''They have not in the least master ed the calling of our names...
...although we ar e their constructors and their cr eators.
That is not in order.''
Ther efor e the cr eatr ess and the cr eator...
...essayed once mor e...
...to build living beings, to make moving cr eatur es.
''Without fail let us try anew!''
Time dr ew near for the dissemination of man and for the illumination.
''Let us build ourselves a keeper!''
The flesh of man was made of tzite-wood...
... but when woman was carved by the cr eatr ess and the cr eator...
...the flesh of woman was made of r eed-grass marr ow.
But still the cr eatur es wer e without sense...
...they spake not befor e the face of their cr eatr ess and their cr eator...
...who made them, who formed them.
And so wer e they destr oyed, dr owned.
For their sakes, the face of the earth was darkened.
Ther e r eigned a rain-darkness...
... pelting-rain by day, and pelting-rain by night.
Small beasts and big beasts flocked together.
Tr ees and r ocks cried shame upon them.
They determined to climb up the huts...
... but the huts made them tumble, and they fell.
They determined to hide in the caves...
... but the caves closed befor e them. ln this manner the second destruction of the beings formed...
...or cr eated like man took place...
...of the beings which ar e doomed to perish, to fall.
They wer e extinguished...
...they wer e all, r oot and branch, destr oyed.
Now ''Flying Robert'' appears small at the horizon...
... umbr ella in hand, his hair teased by the wind...
...wet-thr ough and shaken...
... rigid and sad like no other. ln Paradise you cr oss the sand without seeing your shadow.
Ther e is a landscape even without deeper meaning.
Paradise is available to everybody. ln Paradise only God is looking on.
Ther e you cr oss the sand without seeing your face.
Ther e is landscape even without deeper meaning.
The gates of Paradise ar e open to everybody.
Ther e, works ar e inspected which no one would do.
Ther e you dig holes without stumbling on man.
Ther e you slake lime and ar e chosen for this task by the rich.
Ther e, men cast a shadow in spite of the scorching sun.
Afterwards rar e animals wer e seen ther e. l only have 16 years left...
...to explor e how these monitors...
...can endur e the heat of the sun and still find food.
They live off of the few living beings that exist in this desert...
...smaller lizards and mice...
...who, in the daytime, ar e hidden away in their burr ows in the sand.
They ar e generally large pr edators.
Which you can see by the many flies which ar e gathering her e. l've alr eady been away fr om
Germany for 15 years.
Dear Eugen, we have r eceived your letter very much. How ar e you?
How's life in the hot country?
How ar e you? lsn't it too hot ther e?
When ar e you coming back?
Y es, l am coming back.
A dime.
A dime.
Five bucks or nothing.
Well, ther e ar e certain species...
...of fat tailed sheep which we count on a lot.
They can endur e such incr edible temperatur es...
...of appr oximately 122°F and 140°F.
But ther e ar e only a few.
Some birds ar e able to cool down by taking flight.
But otherwise, you hardly find any life her e.
The desert doesn't make it easy to catch these animals.
For days you have to march thr ough the dunes and the wind...
...to find the monitors. lndividual animals run away at incr edible speeds...
...and try to escape into their burr ows.
And then you have to dig them out with a shovel in this heat. lt's not fun.
But then again, what wouldn't you do to find out about these animals? ln Paradise r oasted pigeons fly dir ectly into your mouth.
Ther e you enjoy yourself without being forced to.
Ther e, enjoyment means obligation. ln enjoyment, man finds himself in Paradise.
The ''Blitzkrieg'' is insanity. ln Paradise even gentiles move mountains.
Ther e, wars ar e pr evented by mothers.
Ther e you expect her ons fr om the left. ln Paradise ruins mean happiness.
Ther e you find gates without borders. ln Paradise plane-wr ecks have been distributed in the desert in advance.
Ther e the landscape is as
God has commanded it to be. ln Paradise you call ''hello'' without seeing anybody.
Ther e you quarr el with strangers to avoid having friends. ln Paradise man is born dead.
While you ar e sleeping...
...acids gnaw and leeches suck at the tuna-fish.
While you ar e dr eaming, an apple fr om a tr ee falls onto your br ow.
While you ar e waiting, trains br eak in two...
...you br eathe softly, as though you wer e dead.
While you r ecline...
...car elessly str ewn stars look out into space.
While you ar e sleeping...
...God softly walks over the fields with Maria. ln the Golden Age, man and wife live in harmony.
Now, for ex ample, they appear befor e the lens of the camera...
...death in their eyes, a smile on their faces, a finger in the pie.
Running, they train themselves harder and harder.
Weight-lifting, too, is r ewarding.
Unforgettable, however, r emains a jump fr om the light-house. ln the Golden Age traces of
Paradise can still be discerned.
Her e, for ex ample, a boat once landed.
Furiously the waves beat against the shor e. ln the backgr ound, smoke is rising, that is to say...
... not even worse than you expected.
Stones that wer e cast do not r eturn by themselves. ln the Golden Age, man does not forget to pray...
... lest God's end be uncomely.
Mor e than by death, even, blessing, and curses...
... man is perturbed by smoke over the world.
Beneath the earth the childr en have found a fir e.
And now the par ents wish suddenly to r eturn to houses of stone.
That's enough, even one of these thoughts would have done.
...and yet, you'r e forcing harvests fr om this mysterious soil. lts thriving brings pain as well as joy to the field-workers. lt's difficult not to encounter a camel on the wayside...
...typically harnessed as a pack, work, or riding animal.
Riding animal!
And her e, as soon as we turn to the right...
...the visitor's joy is gone.
The view is horrifying, and almost silence is necessary.
Pr epar ed for something, we ask ourselves...
...''Wher e ar e we going?''
And silence is the answer.
We'r e gliding thr ough the landscape and it seems as if...
...this tragic mission of strange beauty yet otherwise hell...
...will never end.
We cannot withstand this sight for long...
...and an inner voice urges us to look at the vigor ous plant gr owth...
...that we ar e forcing fr om the earth.
What can we learn fr om the turtle?
She has four fins which she uses to move forward.
She has a hard shell and a hard belly.
Her e she has the head with the mouth wher e she eats.
And she has a r ear end wher e it comes out again. l'm going to get her again.
Ther e is nothing like the
Peace of the Golden Age...
War is pr oclaimed dead by Peace.
Nothing is gr eat as the sand...
Nothing is gr eat as the Peace.
The land is entranced with Peace.
