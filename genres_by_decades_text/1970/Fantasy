ANNABEL:
You're not gonna believe me.
Nobody in their right minds could believe me.
But it's true.
Really, it is.
At exactly 8: 15 this morning...
No, wait.
Let me start back further.
My name is Annabel Andrews.
This is my room.
I like it this way.
You don't have to look for anything.
[Alarm buzzing]
MAN:
Good morning.
It's Friday the 13th.
Ready?
ANNABEL:
No way.
And this is me.
Born in Mountview Hospital
13 years ago.
Give or take a month.
Female, blond.
Natural, of course.
Blue eyes.
Height about 5'2".
I don't remember what I weigh, but I'm watching it.
Which my mother says is ridiculous because I'm not mature in my figure yet.
Mmm...
Maybe by summer, though.
[Sighs]
Gross.
I have one little brother.
Look at him.
Gorgeous hair, gorgeous teeth, gorgeous eyes, gorgeous eyelashes.
He's what you call neat.
Not neat terrific.
Neat neat.
He is so neat it's revolting.
He only does it to show me up.
A goody-goody, you know?
A perfect person and a creep.
His name is Ben, but I call him...
Ape Face!
Will you get out of here?
Don't come busting in without knocking.
It's time for breakfast.
So? Come on, beat it.
Get out of here.
I am.
You'll be late for school.
So what do I care?
Actually, I care.
I mean, school is okay.
I got friends, sports.
Yesterday I was made captain for today's playoff game.
Kind of neat, huh?
I'm also pretty good on water.
We got a super water-ski club.
And we're gonna put on a real aquacade for my dad.
Oh, yeah, about my parents.
William Waring Andrews.
6 feet tall.
Well, 5' 11. 5".
The hair's too short, but I've seen worse.
All in all, a fantastically cool person.
(music) My, oh, my what a wonderful... (music)
He's with Joffert and Jennings.
Public relations.
And the most beautiful person in the world.
Almost.
That's Boris Harris.
What a fox!
I mean, he's really something else.
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, ever since a little incident that happened a while ago,
Boris leaves me alone.
ELLEN:
Annabel!
Time!
Which is more than I can say for her.
Mom and I haven't been hitting it off well.
It's not that
I don't love her. I do.
Why shouldn't I?
Everybody knows mothers are sweet and kind and lovely and gentle and...
Annabel!
And loud.
- [Yelps]
- Ahh!
Max, you big hamburger.
Annabel, where are you going?
I thought we had this all out last night.
Who? Me?
I'm not very hungry.
I don't go for that eggs and bacon stuff.
I want you to be healthy.
That's all, Annabel.
I'm gonna grow up and be a blimp.
I'm already late.
What about your room?
Perfect.
And your bed?
That's made, right?
I forgot, Mom.
It just slipped through my mind.
I got a lot of things to think about.
Mmm.
Annabel,
I don't want to be preachy.
But childhood is the best time in a person's life.
Sure. I'm all for it.
But I got a lot of worries.
Name one.
Just one.
All right.
Worry number one.
I'm late to meet Virginia.
Wish me luck.
Bye-bye.
Bye. Good luck.
Good luck to me, too.
Annabel.
Wait a minute.
Annabel!
Don't forget the orthodontist!
Don't forget the aquacade!
How much you want to bet she does?
- Forget the aquacade?
- Forgets the orthodontist.
It'll serve her right.
Today Dr. Basinger's gonna take her braces off.
It was gonna be a surprise.
You think I should've told her?
About the aquacade?
Oh, Bill, honestly.
What do you think of this?
What?
"Friends, respected clients, and future developers, we are, indeed, honored that you could be present for this formal announcement of our luxurious, new Oceana Marina."
It's good.
I don't think the name is good.
It should be the Isle of Whispering Winds.
- It's interesting.
- Helen, please.
No more help.
You just show up looking beautiful, as usual.
I'll take care of the rest.
Certainly.
Turkey, where you been?
Where have I been?
I've been waiting for hours.
You and me both, kid.
Give me the usual and shake the lead out.
Well, I got quiz number 2A about my room.
It's my room.
I should be able to keep it the way I want to.
All due to the extraordinary efforts of this brilliant...
- ingenious...
- Revolting.
I'm afraid that's not complimentary enough to the developer, my dear.
Nothing very complimentary could be said about Annabel.
[Sighs] No wonder they call it "the terrible teens."
Have you seen how she dresses lately?
Without her, I don't have a water show this afternoon.
Would you like to know where
I have to go this afternoon?
To see Mr. Dilk, the principal at school.
He's asked for a conference to discuss Annabel's lack of academic progress.
What do you think of that?
I'm sure you can handle it, dear.
I'm up to my neck in this.
Thank you.
She's not gonna let me go to Hilary's.
She says she knows all we do there is kissing games.
She's also on my back to get my hair trimmed.
Last time it was trimmed, they hacked 6 inches off.
I try to be cool, right?
Parents seem to be immune to it.
Sometimes I blow my top.
Yesterday I said to her,
"What are you trying to do?
Change my image?"
She said, "I wouldn't know where to start."
Chuckle, chuckle.
That's funny.
VIRGINIA:
If it's any comfort to you, my mom's even rottener than yours.
Mothers don't understand what a person goes through.
I'm an individual.
I can't eat what I want, wear what I want, keep my hair and nails the way I want!
Last night we had it out.
"Listen!" I screamed.
I'm not a screamer.
"You're not letting me have any fun.
You're always pushing me, telling me what to do.
How come nobody ever gets to tell you what to do?"
"Annabel," I said.
"When you're grown-up, people don't tell you what to do.
You have to tell yourself."
Which is sometimes more difficult.
"Oh, yeah," I said in this bitter tone.
That always blows her mind.
"Yeah, you can tell yourself to watch TV all day, go to lunch with friends, eat what you want or go to big parties or movies with Dad."
"And do the laundry,"
I reminded her.
"And the shopping and the cooking.
Make things nice for everybody."
Honestly, Bill, that child has not got a clue about my life.
Not a single clue.
Sounds like a picnic to me.
TOGETHER: I wish I could switch places with her for just one day.
[Mysterious music plays]
All right, what's going on out there?
Something really freaky.
ANNABEL:
Wait a minute.
That's not my voice.
That's Mom's voice.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Good grief.
What am I doing here?
ELLEN: That's not my voice.
That's Annabel's voice.
Are you okay, Annabel?
Annabel?
You all right, Ellen?
ANNABEL:
Ellen?
Hey, whose foot is that?
That's not my foot.
That's Mom's foot.
ELLEN: Good grief.
That's not my hand.
That's Annabel's.
ANNABEL:
Mom's legs.
And her stomach.
And her, uh... uh...
Wow.
Mom's body has got my mind in it.
ELLEN: Annabel's body has got my mind in it.
ANNABEL:
I'm Mom.
ELLEN:
I'm Annabel.
ANNABEL:
Hi, Mom.
I love your teeth.
Annabel, say something.
ELLEN: Who can talk through all this scrap iron?
Could I trouble you for a dime, dear?
"Could I trouble you for a dime, dear?"
Sure.
Wow!
[Pan drops]
Ellen?
You all right?
All right?
I'm great!
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
Hello, Bill?
Yes.
Who's this?
This is...
Annabel, is that you?
Well, yes and no.
Please, if this is some kind of a joke,
I don't have any time.
Button up and listen, Bill.
Who are you telling to button up?
Since when do you call me "Bill"?
What's got into you?
A lot more than you can imagine.
Please, Bill.
Annabel, stop that!
I am not "Bill" to you!
[Sighs] All right.
Dad.
All right.
Now, that's better.
What do you want?
- How's Ellen?
- Ellen?
Mom, I mean.
Is she all right?
Feeling all right?
Annabel, please, if this is some kind of game...
No, it's very important.
Would you take a look?
Hang on.
[Up-tempo music plays on radio]
Yeah, she is acting a little funny.
She's blowing bubbles and hopping up and down.
ELLEN:
Hopping?
I suppose it would look like hopping to the waltz king.
Who's that on the horn?
Oh, that's Annabel.
She wants to know if you're feeling all right.
Are you, honey?
Oh, I feel terrific.
How does she feel?
She's worried about you.
Maybe she ought to come home.
No, tell her absolutely not.
Childhood is the best time in a person's life.
Today I want her to enjoy every minute.
Especially the big typing test.
Oh, yeah.
Tell her I hope she does well in the hockey game.
That is an important playoff.
If she messes up, everybody will hate me.
Her.
Dear, your mother says...
I heard her, Daddy.
Goodbye.
- Hi, Virginia.
- Hi.
Come on, Annabel, let's move out.
You guys are my friends, right?
- I've got to talk to you.
- So talk.
Now, girls, you're not children any longer.
I feel I can speak with you as adults.
You're intelligent enough to grasp exactly what I have to say to you right now.
What is this?
It's your usual "Rum Raisin
Banana Split" breakfast.
Figures.
What else would the junk-food junkie eat for breakfast?
That is about the most revolting concoction
I've ever put inside my mouth.
You see something different?
Something different?
You see I am diametrically different from the Annabel you know.
Correct?
All right.
Listen very carefully.
I'm not Annabel.
Who are you?
I'm her mother.
Oh, that's sensational!
Today we'll be our mothers.
Virginia, dear, do something with your hair.
Don't scuff your shoes.
No, I mean it.
I'm Mrs. Andrews.
Oh, me too, darling.
I'm not Jo-Jo.
I'm Mrs. John Mayberry.
I love it.
Give me a pack of menthols, please.
Are you kidding?
Don't be fresh with me, young man.
I'll report you to the manager.
[Sarcastically]
Oh, no!
JO-JO:
You're terrific, Annabel.
You ought to be in Drama class.
Hurry along, children.
You'll miss the bus.
There's only one thing wrong with this routine.
Our mothers couldn't get through the day like we put in.
What did you say?
- Right on, Annabel.
- Our mothers couldn't hack it.
Your mother wouldn't make it through first period, Bambi.
For sure.
I can just picture my mom trying to handle Miss McGuirk.
Or Ms. Murphy in typing.
They'd freak out.
My mother would not freak out.
Believe me.
You're really weird.
Just a few minutes ago...
Young lady, a great deal has transpired in the last few minutes.
BAMBI:
You really have that down.
I like this game.
- Children, don't tarry.
- Yes, we mustn't miss our bus.
ELLEN:
Are they kidding?
What's so tough about a simple school day?
You coming, Annabel?
You bet she is.
I am.
ELLEN:
Okay, what'll it be, lover boy?
You said scrambled eggs.
Sorry. I don't have time to wash a messy scrambled pan.
Fried?
Cooking's not my thing today.
You can eat this.
Oh, I can't.
That's Annabel's sugar-coated
Snappy Krackles, which she bought with her money to eat when she watches television.
She'll kill me if I eat them.
ANNABEL:
What a nerd.
Annabel wants you to eat her sugar-coated
Snappy Krackles.
- She does?
- She does.
I ought to know.
Move it.
You'll be late for school.
Bye, Mommy.
ANNABEL:
Yuck!
Hon, I want you to do something for me for the ceremony.
Besides water-ski?
- What?
- What?
You've never been on water skis.
I was only kidding, Daddy.
"Daddy"? You never called me
"Daddy" before.
No. I never will again,
Bill, dear.
Are you feeling all right?
- Never better.
- Good.
Hmm.
Better bring me a change of wardrobe for tonight.
White slacks.
A maroon tie.
See if you can find my matching socks.
Are you sure you're all right?
Fine. Fine.
Where was I?
I was finding your matching socks.
Oh, yeah.
- My white shoes.
- White shoes.
- Blue blazer.
- Blue blazer.
It might need a trip to the cleaners.
That shirt with the ruffles down the front?
Be careful when you press it.
It's pure silk, you know.
Anything else?
Now that you ask.
If the shoes need a polish,
I'd appreciate it.
Of course.
Thatagirl.
I do my job, you do yours, right?
ANNABEL:
Oink, oink, Daddy.
Well, maybe Mom will enjoy being in my shoes.
ELLEN: No wonder Annabel runs around barefooted.
These sneakers feel like they're full of marbles.
You're right about your hair.
My mom had mine all hacked off.
And now look at me.
To tell you the truth, it's much more becoming to you short.
Whose side are you on?
How can you expect me to sympathize about your horrible, mean mother?
That's uncalled for.
I'm using your words exactly.
ELLEN:
Is that so?
Come on, girls.
Pay now, talk later.
You're holding up everything.
I don't have one of those cards.
It's okay.
Money's perfectly acceptable.
Virginia, could you possibly?
No, I couldn't possibly.
I know you have more change on you.
I could tell by your walk.
ELLEN:
My walk?
Oh, of course, my walk.
Oh, my God. Jeez.
Excuse me.
Sir? Thank you.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
ELLEN: I don't believe how dirty this foot is.
I doubt it's ever seen a bathtub.
Hmm.
But why should it?
The sock isn't much cleaner.
ANNABEL:
Ooh.
Dumb, dribbly gook.
Yuck!
Who needs hand lotion, anyway?
Let them get old and wrinkled.
Now. What next?
How about a little makeup for the cheeks?
Yeah, why not?
Hmm.
Sadie the painted lady.
You're lovely, my dear.
Simply lovely.
Wait till they see you this afternoon at the marina, sipping champagne.
Ooh, I love champagne.
Wait a minute.
I've never had champagne.
Maybe I won't like it.
Oh, well.
I'll try everything.
I wish I hadn't tried this.
Come on! Stick!
Stick, you hairy, little monster!
Maybe I can cover them up.
Ah, forget it.
Just a touch of color.
Beautiful.
Oops.
Perfect. Just gorgeous.
It's not real.
No, it can't be.
Ridiculous.
Impossible!
What is?
Nothing.
I was just thinking.
Well, I wish you'd stop it.
Everybody's staring.
You look crazy, talking to yourself and waving your hands around.
Sorry.
ELLEN:
I wonder what she's doing?
She probably thinks I spend my day snacking, watching TV.
[Chuckles]
She'll find out.
Ha! Will she find out!
What's with her?
Something wrong with her noggin?
How would I know?
I've never seen her before in my life.
[Muffled]
Oh, ain't that so cute?
[Groans, whines]
ANNABEL: What's the big deal about housework?
How tough can it be?
Toss in a little stuff here.
Toss in a little stuff there.
If it doesn't want to go, you make it go.
That wasn't so bad.
Now for some potato chips.
A little of the boob tube.
Come on, Max.
Whoa.
MAN ON TV:
The makers of Phos Free, the newer, brighter detergent, bring you "Sewing with Susie."
So long, Sister Susie.
[Man speaking Spanish]
Adios, muchacho.
Wiggling, friends.
Can you wiggle like Wiggly?
Let's go.
Come on, wiggle.
Don't let go, Wiggly.
Wiggle this way.
Wiggle!
- Wiggle!
- [Loud banging]
ANNABEL:
It's alive!
Whoa, there!
- [Rings]
- Take it easy!
You're gonna be fine.
Just a little case of the hiccups.
Hello?
Wait!
There's too much racket!
I'll have to take it in the hall!
Thank you!
- Hello?
- [Water splashing]
Hang on. I got to hang up in the other room.
Holy cow!
Couldn't you pick some other day to break down?
What was the matter when Mom was around?
You had to shake yourself to death on my big day?
Come on, now, shape up.
[Gurgling]
Ulysses' Repair and Plumbing.
- [Dialing]
- Four.
BILL:
Hey, there! Hello?
Hey, Ellen! Ellen?
What's happening?
Hello? Operator?
[As operator] Sir, this is a cross-wire connection.
Simply hang up.
Redial your number.
You will be able to reach your party.
This is a recording.
BILL:
Is this my home?
Well, slow down, Mack.
Who is this, anyway?
Bill. It's Bill.
Bill? Bill who?
Oh. Oh!
Hello?
What's going on?
My husband.
Hi, there, Billy Boy.
How's it going in the salt mines?
Never mind.
What's happening there?
Just rinsing out a few things. Why?
Oh, okay.
Joffert, Jennings, and the entire board may be dropping by for drinks.
You better drive down and pick up booze.
Booze?
Drive?
Honey, what's the matter?
Nothing.
It's just I didn't intend to drive anywhere today, Daddy.
Bill.
At noon, after you pick up
Ben from school.
Ben?
ANNABEL:
Oh, Ape Face.
You know that slinky black dress?
Why don't you wear that?
I got to run.
Anything else, I'll call you.
Booze?
My husband, Bill.
ANNABEL:
Iron this, polish that.
Go here, go there.
As a dad, you're super.
As a husband, you're more like a traffic cop.
(music) Annabella couldn't find a steady fella (music)
For pity's sake.
I got a rise out of metal mouth.
You did not.
I can lead some people around by the nose.
Her you can lead by the teeth.
All you need is a magnet.
One thing you need, young man, is a good, old-fashioned spanking.
- Give me mercy.
- Come on, Annabel.
Forget that silly game.
It's not like you.
Hi, I brought your favorite today.
- Tuna fish and peanut butter.
- Tuna fish and peanut butter?
And grape yogurt.
Meet you at lunchtime, okay?
Sure. Okay.
ELLEN: How sickening. No wonder she never eats at home.
You can't eat with Gordy.
Remember we have band practice at noon?
What a shame.
ELLEN: Now let's see how tough this really is.
Wait a minute.
Where am I going?
Oh, schedule, schedule, schedule.
Let's see.
I'll be lucky if I can read her writing, that's for sure.
"Friday, first period.
The Principles of Still Photography."
Oh, sure.
The cornerstone of a good basic education.
Well, at this stage, the developing action has almost been halted, but the film is still highly sensitive.
The safe red light continues to serve its purpose.
And extreme caution should be taken to avoid any outside light for fear of ruining the exposed film.
Now, the next step is to...
Is this Still Photography?
Sorry I'm late.
What about the windows?
You want me to get the shades?
ELLEN:
I think we've goofed.
[Groans]
Sorry about that.
MAN ON RADIO:
That's 555-3069.
And only 2 more calls this hour to solve the K6500 musical mystery medley and win over $5,000 in prizes and trips.
All right here on your music, music, music station.
K6500.
[Up-tempo music plays on radio]
Morning.
I said, "Good morning"!
[Cloth tears]
Mrs. Schmauss, you scared me!
I didn't hear you!
No wonder!
What with this rock 'n' roller stuff blaring.
It gives you a headache!
[Music stops]
That's better.
Now I don't have to yell!
Ah, what a shame.
You ruined that precious outfit.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Well, where do I start, honey?
In the kitchen.
We had a problem this morning.
What happened?
The washing machine went bananas.
Let's take a look and see what's going on!
Oh, no, no!
No wonder!
You're gonna cram your shirts.
And your rugs.
Ohhhh!
And your hose.
And your sneakers.
And some little tin things.
And...
What are these little tin things?
Oh, jacks.
That's cute.
That's cute.
And all your jacks in here together.
Not to mention, you used too much soap.
That is your problem.
Well, that's what comes of letting Annabel help with the laundry.
That sweet thing, trying to be helpful.
A genuine first.
Mrs. Schmauss, get ahold of yourself.
I want you to finish this laundry and then sew up this dress for tonight.
Hold it, honey!
Hold it!
When I came to work for you, there were a couple of things we agreed upon I don't do.
Number one is, I don't do no personal maiding.
I see.
What is the number two thing?
Do we have to go into that again?
Just give me a refresher on it.
What is the number two thing you won't do?
The number two thing
I don't do is,
I don't pick up pigpens.
That's an honor I reserve for the mother of the pig.
Well, look at this.
Dirty clothes.
Ahh.
Banana peel.
Half a paperback.
And now we get to see what's behind curtain number three.
A bicycle pump.
A broken water ski.
A tin shovel.
All right.
Begin.
ELLEN:
This is a snap.
Hey, Bambi.
Psst! Bambi.
There's something wrong with my machine.
Well, turn it on.
What do you mean?
It's a typewriter, not a television.
An electric typewriter needs electricity.
Dummy.
ELLEN:
Electric?
[Chuckles] Oh, well, how different can it be?
This is ridiculous!
Annabel, what's the trouble?
Small mechanical problem here.
Go use one of the other machines.
I'll give you a few extra minutes.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Mrs. Schmauss, would you...
That's another thing
I don't do. Answer doorbells!
All right, already!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Right over there, baby.
Your car, Mrs. Andrews.
Washed, lubed, and I changed the oil.
Oh, thanks...
Lloyd.
A check will be good.
Check?
ANNABEL:
How many years for forgery?
Will you take cash?
Yeah. Some people still use that.
Okay, just a second.
I have to get my mother's... my purse.
[Doorbell rings]
Hang in there, Lloyd.
I have to...
Let me go see who's at the other door.
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
Right on time.
Yes, right on time.
What are you on time for?
The carpets, remember?
It's Friday.
Sure. Sure.
Just slipped my mind.
Cool it, Max.
Care where we start?
Just pick a carpet.
Can I get my $ 14.50,
Mrs. Andrews?
Yeah, I forgot.
I'll get the $ 14.50.
Excuse me, fellas.
I'll find it, Lloyd.
Any of you fellas got $ 14.50 you could loan me?
Hey, you got $ 14.50?
Come on.
MRS. SCHMAUSS:
There you are.
And while we're on the subject.
I have something else to tell you, Mrs. "A."
That kid has no discipline.
And a kid without discipline is the fault of the mother and the father.
Not necessarily, Mrs. Schmauss.
ANNABEL:
What am I saying?
[Doorbell buzzes]
Hi!
Oh, how do you do,
Mrs. Gilbert?
Oh, feel free to call me
Mary Kay anytime.
Oh, yeah. Mary Kay!
Listen,
I need the hair drier.
Sure. Borrow mine.
No, yours is broken.
You borrowed mine yesterday.
Yeah! Here.
Hold Max.
It must be around here someplace.
- In the kitchen?
- I'm sure it is.
I've seen it time and again with you saucy liberals.
That kid'll be on dope before you know it!
Oh, what makes you so sure,
Mrs. Schmauss?!
Mrs. Andrews, can I...
Oh, yes, $ 14.50 and the hair drier.
You got a pair of pliers?
[Doorbell ringing]
Ohhhh!
Listen, you, here.
You hold Max.
While you're looking for the hair drier, find this gentleman the pliers.
I have to find the door.
I wanted my hair drier.
- Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
- Hi.
Bet you thought you'd never see us again.
Brought your nice, clean draperies back.
Pick a window that's empty and put them on it.
MRS. SCHMAUSS: Just in case you're interested, Mrs. Andrews.
You want to know how it starts?
I'll tell you how it starts.
Remember Wednesday when you asked me if I saw that half bottle of gin on the bar?!
I suppose that was your way of accusing me of drinking your liquor.
Yes, probably was.
Aha. Well, I have a secret for you.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Excuse me.
Mrs. Andrews, we've run into a problem here.
Grab a number!
Get in line!
But do you know who's drinking your gin?!
Annabel, huh?
You said it.
I didn't.
Hey, action city.
You're fired!
That suits me fine!
Not now, Mrs. Schmauss!
After you finish my daddy's shirts.
Do them yourself!
You traitor!
Your mop stinks!
Could I just get my $ 14.50?
What about my hair drier?!
Here's your dog, lady!
Maybe we'll come back some other time.
Ellen, my hair drier!
We got to move the china cabinet.
You owe me $ 14.50.
My hair drier!
The hair drier!
Ellen!
[Whistle blowing]
[Marching band plays]
That typing teacher was highly indignant.
She just could not accept that it was an unfortunate accident.
Sorry I missed it.
Sounds like it was a blast.
What a trying day.
I don't know what to expect.
Nothing, as long as you're ready for McGuirk.
"Mc" who?
McGuirk.
English. Term paper.
Oh, no.
What's wrong, Annabel?
It's due today.
Don't you have one?
No. What'll I do?
You better cut English.
I'll tell McGuirk you went to the nurse with a headache.
Should I actually do that?
No, you nerd.
She might send you home.
ELLEN:
That's a good idea.
You can't go home.
The big hockey game's today.
Everyone's counting on you.
Hockey?!
ELLEN:
Those kids will kill me.
I think I do feel a sick headache coming on.
Hey, we're up.
[Plays off-key]
[Whistle blows]
[Whistle blows]
Annabel!
Do you know where you are?!
No. But if you hum a few bars, maybe I can pick it out.
The buffet is set up onshore.
But I thought that our clients and the investors would have more fun with the show itself by watching it from this float.
There's an overall picture of the property.
A good view of the shoreline.
And there's an excellent viewing position for the fireworks display and, of course, the aquacade.
I think we should've held out for the professional water-skiers.
I can assure you there's gonna be a top-notch show.
My daughter and her club have been rehearsing.
This is a big account.
You're sure these kids aren't in over their heads?
Mr. Joffert, I can assure you it's gonna be very, very, very good.
And, well, if I do say so myself, my daughter Annabel is the star of the show.
You really should see her.
I can hardly wait.
[Intercom buzzes]
Excuse me.
Hello?
It's my wife.
Hi, honey.
Well, if you fired her, you fired her.
I don't understand why you're worried about how upset your mother's gonna be.
Your mother lives in Dayton.
I could've told you she was a heavy drinker.
That's not her mother.
That's someone else.
Listen, honey, I'm busy now.
Mechanic, too?
The carpet cleaners?
And the drapery man?
Is the dog still there?
No, I know that's not funny, Ellen.
Now, look, I'll take care of everything later.
Honey, I got to go!
No, look, no.
I'll see you at the marina at 5:00.
Don't forget my clothes.
Yeah, goodbye.
What do you think, Max?
At least there's no ring around the collar.
Okay.
Oh, great.
He's gonna kill me.
I quit!
I really quit.
ANNABEL:
I'm with Mrs. Schmauss.
I don't do personal maiding either.
Everybody around here has had breakfast but me.
Rotten Ape Face!
I'll clobber him!
All right, macaroni and cheese.
Breakfast at last.
What a morning.
I'm bored.
Really bored.
Hmm. Bored.
I wonder if Boris is home.
Hey, Annabel.
Now's your chance.
I can make a pitch for me when I'm not gorgeous.
I mean, when I am gorgeous and not me.
What'll I say?
Let's see.
What's happening, man?
Hi, lover boy.
Hello, Boris?
This is Mrs. Andrews across the street.
I was wondering, could I borrow a cup of...
Sugar's too corny.
...kibble?
Kibble. K-l-B-B-L-E.
You know, the stuff dogs eat?
Yeah, cat kibble.
That'll be fine, too.
When Max is hungry, he'll eat anything.
He's not a kibble quibbler.
Not he.
So I wonder, could...
No.
Annabel's not home.
Terrific.
See you.
Oh, wow.
He's coming over.
I can't let him see me like this.
I've got to find something devastating.
Sexy, slinky.
Velvet maybe.
[Doorbell rings]
ELLEN:
Door's open!
- Come in, Boris!
- [Barking]
[Imitating British accent]
I'll only be a moment, Boris.
Do make yourself extremely comfortable.
[Barking continues]
[Normal voice]
Shut up, Max!
[Barking stops]
ANNABEL:
No, that'd be overdoing it.
Boris!
Oh, this is good of you.
Do come in.
Come in.
[Congested]
Hi, Mrs. Andrews.
Far out!
"Catty Kibbles with horsemeat."
And a ten-cent coupon for a little flea collar.
I can only stay a minute.
I got homework.
Oh, Boris.
I'll treasure it for life.
I got to go.
Yum-yum. Oh, Boris, that's a dreadful cold you have.
Oh, no, no. Let me get you some vitamin "C."
You don't have to.
I'll put this away.
You don't have to.
In the jewelry box.
You know, Boris, this, I believe, is the first time you've had a chance, to see our lovely, lovely home!
It's simple but elegant!
Boris? Boris?
Where are you?
Who lives in here?
My son, Ben.
With a canopy bed and a dollhouse?
With a canopy bed and a dollhouse.
He's a peculiar boy.
He's liberated.
I'll say.
He's also a slob.
Excuse me, Boris.
Boris, here.
Vitamin "C."
Take two.
They're chewable.
Thank you.
Hmm. They're good.
- Delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.
I don't really have a cold.
It's adenoids.
Or an allergy to my mother.
Anyway, it comes and goes.
It keeps me home from school.
Well...
Boris! You want to hang around outside for a while?
Being cooped up in here just gets me crazy.
Sure.
But aren't you dressed kinda funny to be hanging around?
You're right.
I'm gonna put on some shoes.
You and your boy have the same size feet?
Yeah, I told you he's peculiar.
Okay.
Let's go.
...Which indirectly led
United States intervention into what, class?
Korean Conflict.
Yes.
And that took place when, children?
In June or July of 1950 with the naval air and ground forces leading the way.
Precisely.
Didn't anyone else do their preparation for today?
Go on, Annabel.
ELLEN:
Brownie points coming right up.
Well, in order to fully comprehend the Korean Conflict, it is necessary to review all the events.
Is that very hard to throw?
Not if you know how.
Want me to show you?
Mm-hmm.
Come here.
Okay.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Okay, you just swing your arm back.
- Then bring it forward.
- Mm-hmm.
- Swing it back.
- Mm-hmm.
Then you bring it forward.
- Then you swing it back.
- Mmm...
Then you bring it...
Try it by yourself.
Okay.
Say, I bet you do great for a lady.
If you think I'd be good, you should show Annabel.
She'd be so good.
I'd rather show you.
ANNABEL:
Not Mom. Me, dum-dum.
Actually, Boris, lately,
Annabel is completely changed.
She's no longer the same person who cut your head open with a tin shovel in the playground five years ago.
Four.
I've still got the scar.
Okay, four.
Anyway, if you'd seen her lately, you wouldn't recognize her.
Does she still have braces?
'Cause if she still has braces,
I'd recognize her.
I mean, now Annabel is so nice.
She's nice-nice nice.
- Well, I'm sure she is.
- Extremely nice.
But, Miss Andrews, to be perfectly frank, that's not saying much.
Boris, you turkey.
I can't bear it.
Split!
It didn't turn around and come back.
Did it ever do that with you?!
No, I just got it today.
I never thrown it.
The responsibility fell on the Eisenhower administration.
ELLEN:
"Open me"?
[Laughter]
"Clam up and"...Hmm.
Very cute.
Go ahead, Annabel.
You're doing just fine.
Responsibility fell on the Eisenhower administration, which was the first Republican administration in 20 years.
The most salient characteristic of the Eisenhower years was...
What's going on back there?!
I'm sorry, Miss Benson.
I seem to have dropped a book.
[Bell rings]
I gotta get some books at the locker.
I'll meet you after class.
I have an even better idea.
Come on.
I'll show you.
You're too much!
I just can't believe it.
What's wrong?
One day you don't know about history.
Today you made us all look like dummies.
I don't understand, Virginia.
I was just doing what I was supposed to do.
What do you want me to do?
Pretend I didn't know?
- See you later, Annabel.
- Let's get out of here.
Bye-bye, Brains.
ELLEN:
How do you win?!
One bunch thumps you if you don't do well.
The other bunch snubs you if you do!
Oh! What a zoo!
Sorry about that accident.
My fault. I just owe Mary Kay a hair drier and a window.
Yeah, well, anyway, thanks.
Okay.
It's really nice.
Maybe we should do it again.
I mean, we could play Monopoly, something.
- Well, I'd like that.
- Yeah?
Most grown-ups don't want to play games.
They're always too busy or something.
But, then, you're not the same as most grown-ups.
ANNABEL:
Go on. I love it.
You're...
- Yeah?
- Well.
Did you notice my allergy is completely gone?
Yeah.
Maybe I'm allergic to my mother.
But I'm certainly not allergic to you.
In fact, I kinda wish
I was 20 years older.
And I wish I were
20 years younger, or something like that,
I guess.
Oh, well, see you, Boris.
- And Mrs. Andrews?
- Hmm?
Well, you shouldn't blame yourself.
It's not your fault that Annabel's the way she is.
I mean, she's probably what they call a bad seed.
Oh!
I wish I was dead!
Team, listen up!
[Whistle blows]
Listen up!
I don't have to tell you what this game means.
They're out to kill us!
I want you guys to get out there and hit 'em high! Hit 'em low!
ELLEN: I don't believe this.
I've joined the Marines.
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Can we beat these cream puffs?
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Are we gonna beat 'em?
TOGETHER:
Yeah!
Let's get out there and knock their blocks off!
[Indistinct cheering]
Where's your team spirit,
Annabel?
Never seen you so down before.
You haven't?
I guess I'm just a little nervous.
Don't be silly.
All you gotta do is make your usual zillion goals, and we got it made.
ELLEN:
Oh, yeah? No problem.
COACH BETS Y:
Andrews!
Uh-oh.
Andrews, why aren't you changed yet?
Get on the stick!
Sure, but which one's her locker?
Andrews, move, move, move!
My locker's stuck.
You'll just have to perform without me.
Perform without you?
What's with the big words?
Here!
Don't you ever take anything home to be washed?
Never!
Now, suit up and get out there on the double.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up, you guys, and listen!
Now, remember our game plan.
Get the ball to Annabel!
If anybody's gonna win it for us, it's our tough, rock-'em, sock-'em, superjock Annabel Andrews!
[All cheering]
Get your butts out there and kill, kill, kill!
[Cheering continues]
Now, listen, girls.
I taught you to play fair, to play clean, and with good sportsmanship.
Still, the name of the game is winning.
And we can only win this one if you remember one thing.
Get Annabel Andrews and get her good!
[All cheering]
Look, I'm gonna try my best today, but if anything should go wrong...
Well, why should it?
Well, I told you.
I'm not the same person today.
So I've noticed.
You have to snap out of it.
This is a real important game.
I'll try.
But I mean it.
I'm not the same person.
[Whistle blows]
Forward in the "centa"!
Center.
Oh!
Hey, that's you.
Go get 'em, Annabel.
ELLEN: I played this once in eighth grade.
Ready to bully!
Bully!
Come on, let's go!
Ow! Ow! Oh!
Don't worry. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.
Go get it!
How come you didn't bring the car?
How come I didn't bring the car?
Quit griping, will you?
I thought we could use the exercise.
We'll never make it home for lunch.
Sit here. It just happens
I brought lunch with me.
It's a pickup lunch.
Pick up anything you want.
Throw the rest back in the bag.
- Gin?
- Aaah!
That's the wrong bag, honey.
No lamb chops, baked potato, and string beans?
Not unless you want to cook it yourself.
I fired Mrs. Schmauss.
Yahoo!
You didn't like her either.
Like her?
Mom, I hate her!
She talks cross and smells funny.
But mostly I hate her because she says Annabel's a spoiled brat and a pig.
I heard that once today.
I don't have to hear it again.
Besides, does it make sense?
You hate Mrs. Schmauss because
Mrs. Schmauss hates Annabel.
But Annabel hates you.
By rights, the person you should hate is Annabel.
I know.
I try, but I just can't.
Why not?
Well, for one thing.
Let's see.
She gets neat ideas.
Like the time we filled up balloons with water and threw them out the window.
Oh, that was really neat.
Want to tell Mommy some other neat things Annabel thinks up?
There's Billy and John!
Can I go play with them?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
ANNABEL:
He's not as finky as I thought.
Don't just lie there, Annabel!
Get up and hit 'em back!
We're gonna lose if she don't get off her duff.
Time-out. Time-out.
I gotta tie my shoelaces, here.
No, hold on!
Who did that?
You're gonna get it this time.
[Whistle blows]
Foul!
Yes, definitely a foul.
Questionable.
ELLEN: Two years and $2, 000 to get these teeth straightened, and they want to knock them out in one afternoon.
I quit!
Annabel, come on back!
Annabel, where are you going?
The game's not over.
The score is tied.
We can still win.
Where are you going, Annabel?
Can't you take it?
She's probably changing from blue to yellow.
Annabel, yellow?
Sloppy, yes.
Yellow, never!
All right, give me that broomstick, and get out of my way!
We're gonna win this game!
[Whistle blows]
I got this!
I got it!
Ahh!
BOYS:
Yeah!
Wow!
BO Y:
No way!
Yay!
You're out!
What do you mean, I'm out?
- You're out!
- No, I'm not.
- I was safe.
- You're out!
What do you mean, I'm out?
Go take a walk!
Okay. Mmm!
Strike three!
You're outta there!
Whoo!
All right!
No, no.
That's the wrong goal!
Come back, Annabel!
Don't do this to me!
Hey, way to go, Annabel!
Good move!
No, Annabel.
No! No!
No! No! No!
[Whistle blows]
Oh!
Time!
Winning goal by blue captain,
Annabel Andrews!
Final score.
Reds, eight.
Blues, Seven!
Where did I go wrong?
I know it's hard for you to remember.
I'm Jo-Jo, and you're Annabel.
And we both play for the same team.
ELLEN: Oh, good grief.
I've goofed again.
Boy, Mom, that was terrific.
That's even better than Annabel.
She's a super ballplayer.
Really?
- And she's beautiful.
- She's what?
I think she's beautiful.
And I love her braces.
I hope when I get that old,
I'll have braces, too.
With your luck, you won't need braces.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Then Annabel's gonna hate me more than she does now.
Well, why does she hate me so much?
Because there's nothing more annoying than a little blue-eyed saint with perfect teeth who's always on time, never has a messy room.
Do you hate me, too?
Don't be a jackass.
I'm trying to tell you why Annabel hates you.
But I can't help those things.
I can't help what I look like.
And about being neat.
I can't help that, either.
Listen, if I thought she'd like me better,
I'd be messy.
I've even tried being messy.
Once I took all my piled-up blocks and the books on the shelves and the big bag of marbles and the LEGOs and threw them so Annabel wouldn't be the only one getting in trouble.
That stinky old Mrs. Schmauss said I was too young to know any better and picked everything up.
So no matter what I do,
Annabel keeps on hating me.
Well, why don't you hate her back?
That's a good idea.
I told you before.
I tried.
But you can't hate someone and love them.
Can you, Mom?
No, I didn't use to think so.
ANNABEL:
But maybe you can.
Now blow.
- Feel better now?
- Uh-huh.
Come on, let's go home.
Honey, where have you been?!
Never mind.
We've got problems.
That rat-fink Mary Kay.
She called you?
Told you about the boomerang through the window, did she?
I've got a real problem.
Will you listen for half a minute?
We have no buffet for the marina tonight.
Mrs. White thought Mrs. Matthews was gonna handle this.
Mrs. Matthews thought Mrs. White was gonna handle this.
Who's gonna handle it?
- You are!
- Me?!
There's only gonna be 25 people.
I've already told them what a great cook you are.
- No! But I...
- Honey.
You got three whole hours.
Thanks, love.
Goodbye.
Whew!
Bah!
Male chauvinist pig.
Mommy, why did you call Daddy a male chauvinist pig just now?
Because that's what he is.
But what is one?
A male chauvinist pig is a husband who spends three months taking bows for a shindig he's gonna throw, and he gives his wife three hours to save his skin.
Oh.
[Intercom buzzes]
Yes, Mr. Andrews?
ELLEN:
Uh-oh.
Where did she come from?
Uh-huh.
Oh, could you hold on a minute, please?
May I help you?
Could you tell Mr. Andrews that his daughter would like to see him?
Mr. Andrews?
Your daughter is here.
Fine.
Would you walk this way, please?
You've got to be kidding.
You're the new secretary,
I suppose.
Enjoying your work?
Oh, very much.
How is Mr. Andrews to work for?
Oh, he's just a doll.
We get along.
He's pleasant and very professional.
I can't complain.
I can.
You know, Miss...
Gibbons.
Miss Gibbons, yes.
My father is an extremely devoted family man.
Extremely devoted.
Oh, I know he is.
He talks about you and your mother all the time.
She must be a lovely person.
Darn tootin'.
She's quite a doll, also.
Dangerous lady to lock horns with, if you know what I mean.
- Hi.
- Huh?
Oh, hi, Honey.
What brings you here?
Oh, nothing much.
Why didn't you tell Mom about your secretary?
What's there to tell?
But, darling, you always used to tell me.
Too late, Miss Gibbons.
I've already seen your action.
Mr. Andrews, you wanted to sign this as soon as it was ready.
Thanks.
Lucille, you're not going somewhere?
Oh, no.
It's just a bit chilly in here, don't you think?
Oh, yeah.
Hadn't noticed.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Now, what can I do for you?
Look at me.
Aren't I revolting?
You look like a typical teenager to me.
And I think it's time for a change.
You came to ask me that?
Well, no, not exactly.
You know, I'm getting my braces off this afternoon.
I thought I'd get my hair done and my nails.
What's left of them.
You don't need my permission for that.
Oh, I know.
But I thought I'd go out and get some new clothes to go with the new me.
I wondered if I could borrow your credit cards with a note of authorization.
I think we can do that.
Miss Gibbons can take care of it.
I'll bet she can.
I think I hate Miss Gibbons.
Yes, Mr. Andrews?
Yeah.
Would you take a short note, please?
Yes, sir?
To whom it may concern.
"To whom it may concern."
Please allow my daughter,
Annabel Andrews, whose signature appears below, to use my credit cards, et cetera, et cetera.
Sincerely yours.
Got that?
Certainly.
Have it ready for you in a jiffy.
Ugly-looking thing, isn't she?
I'll tell you the truth.
I've seen her look better.
She's got a lot on her mind.
She better not have.
Such as?
Husband's out of a job, sick kid, and a difficult mother-in-law.
Annabel, I don't have time to spend on this.
Anything else I can do?
No, nothing.
This is fine.
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, Dad.
Ellen Andrews, you are a conniving, suspicious old bat.
Thanks a lot, Daddy.
Okay.
Preheat oven to 325.
How do you do that?
Turn it to preheat, stupido.
Sweetie.
Preheat on our stove is when the oven and the broiler are on.
It gets hot faster.
Oh.
For a 20-pound bird, that will take 61/2 hours.
Do we have time?
Only if you double everything.
Turn it up full blast.
- [Telephone rings]
- Answer that, will you?
Hello?
Hang on.
It's for you.
Can't you see I'm up to my armpits in gunk?
Who is it?
What do they want?
Who are you, and what do you want?
Okay, I'll tell her.
That was the principal's office.
He says you're 15 minutes late for the conference with him.
Mr. Dilk?
What does he want?
Wow!
What does he want?!
Oh!
Male chauvinist pig!
Mr. Dilk, too?
No, still your father for getting me into this mess.
Who are you calling?
Hello, Boris?
This is Mrs. Andrews.
How would you like to babysit a small boy and a turkey?
Let's see, what else can I tell you?
The bird's in the oven.
Just don't touch it, whatever you do.
And, Boris, you don't say you could whip up a dessert for about 25?
Oh, you know, Jell-O, something like that.
I made a chocolate mousse once.
Do that again.
He's gonna cook?
Isn't that sort of a sissy thing to do?
Look who's talking.
The kid with the canopy bed and the dollhouse.
- I don't have a...
- Your nose is runny!
I wouldn't mention that.
He's sensitive on the subject.
I can imagine.
Everything fine?
Okay, I'm off and running, kids.
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.
- Got your car keys?
- Car keys?
For the car, you mean?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
In the state I'm in,
I'd probably kill myself if I drove.
I can take the bus.
I've got bus fare.
I'll put this on in the bus.
Annabel!
Where have you been?!
We've been looking all over!
I got some new clothes.
Come on.
We have to hurry.
Come on, Annabel!
Hurry up!
Why didn't you tell us where you were going?
You look different.
Your dad's gonna be mad.
Let's get this hearse moving.
How could you come up with a grade like that?
Doesn't she talk up in class?
All the time.
Doesn't that add up to something?
It does. 37.
But Annabel has an extraordinary I.Q., and her verbal aptitude is higher than a college freshman.
Nobody ever told me that.
Why didn't you tell me that?
ANNABEL:
I'm really a whiz?
I admire and love your little girl.
She's the child every teacher dreams of discovering in her classroom.
When you finally do and can't get through to her at all, then you have to face the fact that perhaps I am the failure.
And that Annabel, in more capable hands, would learn to implement the gifts that God gave her.
But I don't have that ability,
I guess.
And it just breaks my heart.
Come now, Miss McGuirk.
Don't cry.
It's not your fault.
She's sometimes a bit of a flaky chick, that's all.
This is your daughter we're discussing.
Yes, I know.
She's suddenly changed from a model student to a flaky chick.
Yes, flaky. That's it.
There has to be a reason for her behavior.
A variation in her environment?
The emergence of a heretofore suppressed sibling rivalry?
Will you run that by me in plain English, please?
Does your family favor your son over your daughter?
Ape Face?
No, he's just a kid.
Well, she's obviously rebelling at something.
I think she just wants to do her own thing, that's it.
Naturally, that's the normal teenage...
Could it possibly be you?
Are you an attentive mother?
Too darned attentive, I'd say.
Are you understanding?
Never.
Overdemanding?
You bet.
ANNABEL:
Hey, this is fun!
With all due respect,
Mrs. Andrews, do you consider yourself an able parent?
Yeah.
I'm not number one on the charts, but I'd say I'm in the top ten.
You are loving to your daughter, aren't you?
Of course I am.
What kind of question is that?
That's a dumb question.
Yeah, what kind of a dumb question is that?
This is going to be a little more difficult than I...
Tell me, is there trouble between you and your husband?
Now, hold on, Charlie!
Charles, please.
Charles, this is getting out of hand.
We're here to talk about grades, not my father.
Oh, ho ho! Mrs. Andrews.
Did you hear what you said?
Yes, I called my husband my father.
Big deal!
Revealing, don't you think?
I think you have an awful lot of nerve prying into people's personal affairs.
Attaway to go, Mom.
We're interested in getting at the root of Annabel's problem.
She needs help.
And she's not the only one.
Besides, I think she just got that help.
Come Monday morning, you're going to see a brand-new Annabel.
We mustn't expect her to change just like that.
Stranger things have happened,
McGuirk.
[Sizzling]
BEN: You think we ought to turn it off?
Sounds like it's gonna explode!
Your mother said not to touch it.
Now what happens?
The chocolate gets blended with the egg whites and brandy.
I'll do it!
No!
Turn it off!
Creep!
Oh, man! Now I gotta start all over again.
Sorry!
Hey, that's kinda good.
Boris, look!
Yeah, yeah, I see you're a mess.
Come on.
You need a bath.
But, Boris...
Come on!
Hi, guys.
Ape Face. Ape Face.
It's nice to see you looking dirty.
Making mud pies?
- Mousse pies.
- Yeah?
It blew up by mistake.
Blew up?
You're joking.
The turkey's about to...
That's enough, Max.
Let the chocolate soldier go get washed up.
Ooh, great.
Come on, you two.
You clean up the walls.
You clean up the body.
To the showers.
Go, go to the showers.
You to the kitchen.
What's that smell?
Oh, no.
Open a window, if you can find it.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, a vent.
I can't breathe.
Exploded mousse and burnt turkey!
Boris, how could you do this to me?
- Sorry.
- [Telephone ringing]
What now?
Get myself together.
Just pretend.
Hello?
[Coughs] Yes?
Ellen, where are you?!
Where's the food?!
Right here.
It's all around me, actually.
Where's Annabel?
I need her help now.
She's getting ready for the aquacade.
What?
She's going to water-ski?
She'll be killed!
She's one of the best water-skiers in the state.
She may have been this morning, but she isn't now.
You've got to stop her, Bill.
Honey, you just let me handle this end of it, will you?
You get down here with that food!
Counting on you both.
But you're counting on the wrong both!
I want my Mommy!
It's all right.
Let's make this a creative enterprise.
Boris, let's start all over.
Forget this thing.
We have some Catty Kibble left, some green noodles,
Tabasco sauce.
We'll make a New Orleans casserole.
We'll sprinkle a little bread crumbs.
I think I have some olives.
It'll be wonderful.
Parsley!
Let's get going, Boris.
Come on, Annabel.
Get your skis on.
I'm not going through with it, Bill.
Don't start that.
I've been bragging for weeks.
Don't let me down now.
I'm not the same person you think I am.
You sound just like your mother.
Let's get into your skis.
You don't care whether
I live or die.
We'll talk about that after the aquacade.
I'll help you.
Come on, into the skis.
There we are.
First the foot.
Have we got everything?
Where's the turkey?!
You're gonna eat that thing?
You ever heard of smoked turkey?
Go get it, tiger!
Listen, Boris.
I haven't got much time.
There are a few kooky things you should know.
Try and understand.
I need your help desperately.
You name it.
Well, to begin with,
I know it's hard to believe, but I don't know how to drive.
You're right.
I don't believe you.
Do you drive, Boris?
Kinda, but I don't got a license. I can get arrested.
It's better than getting killed.
I can't drive.
I'm only 13 years old.
Oh, sure, and I'm only 38.
Please, Boris, don't you believe me?
I'm not my mother.
I'm Annabel Andrews in my mother's body.
You understand?
Don't ask me how it happened.
You don't believe me, do you?!
I think you're crazy.
Boris, I can't argue that.
Not in the very least.
I am a fruitcake.
But what kind of irresponsible person are you to let me, a fruitcake, drive a car?
I might get killed.
Don't you care?
Well, yeah, I care.
All right.
If you care, get into this car and drive me to the marina so I can save my Dad's neck and my Mommy's life.
I don't care that much.
Boris, buzz off.
Go ahead! Go away.
Who needs you?
I got the turkey, Mom!
Let's go!
Wait a minute! 'Cause I don't want to go to jail doesn't mean I don't want to help.
Creep, get in.
Onward and upward!
Listen, let me put it this way.
Number one,
I'm not gonna make a fool out of myself, let alone break every bone.
Annabel, you can't do this to me.
My job may depend on this deal.
I'm sorry.
But I just can't do it.
Okay, okay, I give up.
Here, sit down.
We'll talk about it.
Here, hold this.
Hit it, Charlie!
I'm sorry, honey!
I had to do it!
ELLEN:
Bill, you dirty louse!
Oh! Help!
- Which way do I turn here, left?
- Right.
- Right?
- No, left.
- Left?
- Right.
- Right?
- Left's that way.
Uh-oh.
Hey, I think we got company.
I wish I had my own body back!
[Mysterious music plays]
Right body, wrong place!
Annabel, where'd you come from?
- Where did Mom go?
- Don't ask me.
How'd you do that?
- Could you do it again?
- I hope not.
Wait, wait, wait!
Andrews, isn't that your wife out there?
Yeah. What?
Yes, sir, yeah.
I believe it is.
What is she doing out there?
What? Well...
It's a mother-and-daughter act, Jennings.
Yeah, that's it.
That's exactly it.
[Laughs]
Where's the daughter?
Huh?
Hey, Annabel, what are you doing?
Why don't you stop before somebody gets killed?!
Mom needs us.
And if I'm here, she's worse off than we are.
I find that hard to believe.
Oh, oh, oh!
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo!
Hey, what are you doing?
No!
Hey, where'd everybody go?
Coming through.
No, no, right.
- No, the other way.
- No!
BORIS:
Look out, Mister!
Look out, everybody!
Get your mitts off the wheel.
Take this thing off my head.
- They're getting closer!
- More of them!
Yeah, I see 'em.
Whoa, whoa!
Whatcha doing?
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
No, no, no!
Why aren't you driving the boat?
She's amazing, Andrews.
Why didn't you tell us about her?
Well, I want it to be a surprise, sir.
Well, it sure is to me.
That makes two of us.
Three of us.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Good show!
Would have been better at night.
Nonsense.
You had it planned that way.
Yes, I did.
What's next?
What's next?
Well, I think the next trick's out there somewhere in the water.
Road hog!
Neat wheelie, Mrs. Schmauss!
Don't lose it!
Stop this thing!
I want to get off!
Coming through, fellows!
Excuse me!
Pardon me!
Look out behind you!
Down! Down!
Oh, no! No! No!
- Pardon me, young man.
- Whoa!
Can you help me, please?
Watch out, lady.
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
C'est bizarre!
What?
What?
- Huh?
- Hey, what? What?
Don't take your eyes off him, folks.
He's the daredevil of Bay City.
I believe you've got your sexes mixed up.
Beg pardon?
It's not a he.
It's not a he.
She's my wife!
She's up in the air!
She's on a kite!
She's so young!
Ellen!
Honey!
Don't "honey" me!
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the kiteflyer.
Look out!
Did you see that pile-up?
Really gross!
Uh-oh!
Yippee!
Stop!
Quick, Annabel.
Put it in reverse!
- Mrs. Andrews?
- Mom?
[Cheering]
- Come on, Mom!
- Oh, Annabel!
I thought you were gonna wipe out.
So did I.
It's nice to know you care, my darling.
It's nice to know I do.
Believe me, I do.
Oh, Mom, I really love you.
I love you, too, darling.
Hey, Mom, can I take driving lessons from Annabel?
Not on my street, you're not.
We'll see, Benji.
Right now, I'm so glad to be me again.
Hey, right on, Mom.
How do you like yourself?
I don't know.
Annabel, about your hair.
They only took off an inch and a half.
I bought you a new outfit.
You don't have to wear it.
Your teeth.
Don't you like your new teeth?
Not the way I look.
I was talking about the way I am.
I am so much smarter than I thought.
And so much dumber.
Oh, my darling, aren't we all?
Oh, Annabel.
Your family is a bunch of comedians.
That's one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.
Yeah.
I guess it was, wasn't it?
You bet it was.
No way to top it.
Right, Jennings?
I think we should have held out for professional...
[Laughter]
That doesn't quite explain it for me, Ellen.
I don't quite understand how you got on the kite.
Darling, all's well that ends well.
Yeah, but that doesn't...
- You look great, Annabel.
- Thanks.
Yeah, you're not the same way you used to be at all.
Is that good or bad?
Well, no.
What I mean is, you're a completely different person.
Well, maybe not completely yet, but I'm working on it.
ELLEN:
Stew, stew, stew.
You're being less than direct with me.
I'm a little worried about your mom.
She's acting kind of weird.
You don't think she's what they call a bad seed, do you?
Well, I think you'll be noticing some changes in her, too.
I like a more level-headed woman like you.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I think I know what you mean, Boris.
Where are you guys all going?
We're gonna get some pizza.
Oh.
You want to go with us?
Me? Really, me?
Really. Come on.
Oh, man.
[Chuckles]
Ellen, what I saw you do today was impossible.
How can you sit there?
We're gonna go get some pizza.
Anybody want any?
I can't get a straight answer.
Would you explain what happened today?
Please, will you?
Look, did I or did I not force you into the water?
Well, yes and no.
[Chuckles]
Great.
You're just like your mother.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Mom, Boris and I are gonna go to the beach tomorrow.
Can you drop us off?
Sure.
That's very nice.
I could do it.
I've got to get started on my motorcycle campaign.
What am I gonna do while everyone is busy?
Tomorrow's Saturday.
You ice-skate, right?
I hate ice-skating.
My feet get cold, and my ankles hurt.
When I was a boy,
I used to love ice-skating.
You get all the fun stuff to do, Dad, like kiteflyers and ride motorcycles.
As long as we're comparing,
I'd like to be in your shoes.
And I'd rather be you.
Bill, I wouldn't pursue this any further if I were you.
You would not want to change places with Ben, believe me.
Yeah, you don't want to change places with Dad over there.
- Oh, yes, I do!
- Oh, yes, I do!
Help!

{{{the end}}}
''In Search of Unicorns--
''a Book for ChiIdren.''
Chapter 1.
AII in a night, spring came... rushing from beyond the ends of the earth... and spiIIing out aII over Umberny... its sack fuII of coIors... and buds and birds' eggs... snaiIs and tadpoIes... rainbows and newborn animaIs.
Bees hummed... mammoths gamboIed... meadows rang with the pIighting of troths... and deep in his ancestraI cave...
Hero--fairbeard frisky...
Lord of aII Umbs-- snored and grunted... stirred and groaned... and got out of bed to Iook outside.
''FiddIe-fuddIe, Umb.
''A thousand spitting curses!''
Cathryn...
Una stared at the carved, curving creature-- deIicate, questing, perfect-- with arched neck and a singIe sIender horn.
''Sir Frisky,'' she cried.
''Sir Frisky, what was it?
''What did I see?''
Hero stared back.
''Why, a unicorn.''
Una was trembIing
Iike an aspen... paIe as a unicorn herseIf.
Straight past his nose zoomed 7 enormous butterfIies... with eyes Iike stars and bright bIue wings... and each one was humming.
And then Hero started to trembIe... for it seemed to be him who was humming-- not with his usuaI tuneIess hum... but a butterfIy's humming... just as if one had fIown down his throat.
The stone circIe was shrouded in stiIIness.
There was no whisker of wind... but the hoIy tree swayed and tossed... as if in the grip of some terribIe storm.
Deep sobbing broke from its trunk... as though some Iocked creature was struggIing to escape.
It was raining-- a sudden, torrentiaI downpour.
Snug in Rose Nest with aII the bIinds puIIed down...
AmberIash was coziIy entertaining Eggbert to tea.
''This IoveIy weather shouId hoId...
''shouIdn't it,
Eggbert, darIing?
''No one couId catch coId, not seriousIy--
''I mean, die of pneumonia-- out tonight.''
Cathryn...
In the pit, the water rose round Una's ankIes... creeping up about her knees.
''Oh, bother. BIast!'' she sobbed.
''I bet I'II drown.''
SuddenIy, the sounds of something... came crashing through the forest, nearer and nearer-- severaI somethings.
And then she heard the snorkeIing trumpetings of...
''Hero! Hero!
''HeIp, heIp! Get me out!''
In a fIash, the Lord of Umberny was off his steed...
Ieaning over the edge of the pit... stretching a Iong arm down in the pouring rain.
''It's no good,'' Una sobbed.
''I can't see anything...
''not even your hands.
''I'm too deep.''
-HeIIo?
-Cathryn?
It's Joan. Can you taIk?
Hey, you sound different.
Are you aII right?
Yeah. Fine.
You didn't sound
Iike yourseIf.
Must be the connection.
You know what just happened?
That son of a bitch caIIed me just now.
He wants me to pay some goddamn percentage... of Iast year's taxes... because we were IegaIIy community property then... or some such buIIshit.
Oh, God.
WeII, yeah. I had a date with this guy Howard.
You don't know him.
OnIy met him Iast week at some party or other.
Anyway, he was sitting right here... and I broke down and just cried... and hung up on him.
Then I made a damn fooI out of myseIf with Howard.
ToId him to Ieave, that I couIdn't go out.
And he--ouch! God...damn it!
That cat!
WeII, he just stepped right on my boob.
That hurts.
Joan?
HeIIo?
Joan, is that you?
No. Who did you want?
I was taIking to Joan.
Is that you, Cathryn?
-Who's speaking, pIease?
-Don't you know?
Cathryn! Cathryn!
Are you there?
Cathryn, can you hear me?
WeII, what happened?
I don't know.
Must have been a crossed Iine.
WeII, Iisten.
Are you and Hugh going out?
No. Hugh's got to st--
Hugh's got a business dinner.
Oh. WeII, maybe I'II come over.
I'd reaIIy Iike a drink.
What movie's on tonight?
I don't know. I was going to go to bed, but come on over.
Listen, I promised Judy
I'd caII her.
I'II get right back to you, ok?
Ok. Fine.
I'II get right back.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
HeIIo?
Cathryn?
Is that you, Cathryn?
Yes. Who is it, pIease?
Do you know where your husband is tonight?
What?
I said, do you know... where your husband is tonight?
Who's speaking, pIease?
You don't know?
-HeIIo?
-HeIIo. AIert.
This is a bIow aIert.
-This is the teIephone company.
-Hugh, Hugh!
We're going to bIow out the Iines.
Yeah, baby, it's me. Listen.
Listen, I just caIIed to teII you not to wait up.
I'm going to be Iater than I thought.
-What?
-You hear me?
What?
I just wanted to teII you.
Oh, fine.
Do you know what's bIack and white... and bIack and white and bIack and white? Huh?
A nun faIIing downstairs.
That's good, eh?
Listen, I'II see you in the morning.
-Hugh?
-No, it's me.
Cathryn. Cathryn?
Yes? I want to speak to my husband, pIease.
That's who I'm caIIing about-- oId Hugh.
PIease, wiII you put my husband on?
Oh, Cathryn,
I wouId if I couId.
If this is one of Hugh's IittIe jokes... just teII him
I don't think it's very funny.
-Funny, eh?
-Who's speaking, pIease?
Not funny.
At this moment, oId Hugh is with a girI-- probabIy in bed by now-- at Ambassador Towers...
1334 CommerciaI Drive.
The teIephone number is 274-9382.
Why are you teIIing me this?
Why are you teIIing me this?
Good-bye.
I just thought
I'd better teII you... if you try to caII them... you'II probabIy get a busy sound.
I imagine they've taken the phone off the hook.
After aII, isn't that what you do... when you don't want to be disturbed?
I'm sure they don't want to be disturbed.
Cathryn? Cathryn, can you hear?
Cathryn, I'm taIking to you about your husband-- about oId Hugh.
How was the meeting?
A waste of time.
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Cathryn.
Why are aII the phones off the hook?
Isn't that what peopIe do when they don't want to be disturbed?
What if I tried to reach you?
I didn't think that was very IikeIy.
What the heII is that supposed to mean?
Who the heII wouId caII at this time of night?
Oh, thank God it's you!
-Jesus Christ, Joan!
-I've been caIIing aII night.
It is 4:00 in the morning.
Is Cathryn aII right?
-Yes, she's aII right.
-I want to taIk to her.
I'II have her caII you in the morning.
Good night. SIeep tight.
Jesus Christ!
About your friends!
Shit.
I want to get to the bottom of this phone business.
And I want to know who you were with.
What the heII is that supposed to mean?
It means I want to know her name.
What's the matter, baby?
Did someone caII you?
Did someone teIephone?
Huh? Who was it?
-Who caIIed?
-I don't know. Some woman.
She kept phoning me and... teIIing me about you and some girI--
AwfuI things that...
I don't know.
She kept ringing, and I'd hang up... and she'd ring again.
Hugh, it's not true, is it?
TeII me it's not true.
Of course it isn't true.
I can prove where I was and who I was with... if that wiII make you feeI any better.
But why wouId anyone do such a thing?
I mean, she even gave me a phone number and address.
Now, what was her name... this girI I was supposed to be with?
I just kept seeing you with this girI.
Oh, Hugh.
I want to go home.
I want to go to Green Cove.
-Can we both go?
-Of course.
-Can we go together?
-Yes.
-Right now?
-In a few days.
I have to square things away, and then we'II go, aII right?
Listen, Iisten.
There is no one eIse.
There is onIy you--just you.
Come here.
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Cathryn?
Cathryn? Jesus Christ!
What's the matter, baby?
Are you aII right?
What happened?
You scared the shit out of me.
Are you aII right, baby?
-What happened?
-No, I just have--
What are you yeIIing so for?
-I just had a dream.
-A dream?
What kind of dream?
Cathryn, I have got to know what's happened.
-Leave me aIone!
-AII right.
-I don't know!
-AII right.
AII right.
Now, I'II caII George.
You just stay there and rest.
I'II caII George, and he'II take care of everything.
Then we'II drive out to Green Cove.
It wiII take us a coupIe of hours.
We both need a rest.
The beginning.
''Long, Iong ago''... wrote Ancient, the wise historian... in big, sIow, spidery writing...
''the most heavenIy spirit of the universe...
''tossed from her finger
Iike an emeraId...
''the fair Iand of Umberny.
''Very far down through the reaches of the sky...
''it feII...
''to sink into the heart of the great continent.
''To Umberny's north Iay GoII.
''To Umberny's south Iay Gonn.
''To east and west...
''to east and west...
''a great many other Iands Iie...
''but none is as fair as the Iand of the Umbs.''
It's beautifuI.
I Iove it here.
There's a covey of quaiI down there.
Right down there, between those trees.
Umbs, as you probabIy know... are very smaII peopIe-- quarreIsome, peacefuI, jeaIous and kind... cowardIy, brave, happy and sad... as man-chiIdren have been since the dawn of time.
They Iive in caves or IittIe, stone, conicaI houses... wear thick, furry bearskins... hunt and fish and farm... and paint wonderfuI things on the waIIs of their caves.
But one thing you can never teII about an Umb is his age.
Some are born Iooking oId... others you'd think are 5 or 12... can very weII turn out to be 300.
And as nobody in Umberny can count... nobody bothers a bit.
''I do beIieve...
I do beIieve I can begin''... the wise oId historian muttered... and he shuffIed across to a sheIf stacked up... with pieces of fresh bark... and pots and pots of mammoth bIood... shuffIed back with his fresh sheet... and dipped his quiII again.
''In 59310, here at the Umbs'...
''spring had faIIen overnight...
''rushing from beyond the ends of the Earth.''
You don't mind going down aIone, do you?
-No.
-Light a fire.
I won't be Iong.
You've got the keys, don't you?
Cathryn.
Who's up there? Who is it?
Hugh.
Hugh?!
Hugh?
Hugh, the chim--
Hugh, the chimney's on--
Cathryn?
Jesus Christ, Cathryn!
Open the fIue!
You didn't open the fIue!
Turn off the gas.
Turn it off!
Have you--turn it off.
It's not off.
Wait. Here, Cat.
Let me--there.
Open the window.
Here, Iet me get that.
Jesus Christ.
Were you upstairs just now?
-What?
-Were you upstairs?
Of course not. Why?
Why did you ask me that?
I must be imagining things.
I just thought...
I heard somebody moving about.
It's impossibIe.
Hugh, I did hear something.
What are you trying to do-- smoke him out?
I heard something, anyway.
I'II have a Iook.
Maybe some animaI got up there.
Cathryn.
Got him.
Got him.
What a chase-- down the haII... into the bathroom, into the bedroom... then the Iinen cIoset.
That's where
I first saw the spoor.
A coupIe of eIves riding his back.
Got them, too.
Two in 1 shot.
We'II bury them after dinner in the back.
What's for dinner?
Spaghetti and saIad.
Spaghetti.
Forgot the wine.
I put out 4 bottIes of the whiskey.
I know.
I was using them with the fruit and the cheese... in a setup.
Forgot them.
It doesn't matter. You can get some when you go into town.
Spaghetti without wine... is Iike a ship without a rudder... and tomorrow is another day.
Wait a minute.
Good.
Gonna try for those birds one more time.
Hugh, didn't we have a coIander?
-A what?
-A coIander.
You know, that pan with the hoIes in it.
Strainer!
Did you take that home?
No. I've got one at home.
You mean, we own 2 coIanders?
Find it?
No, but you'II never guess what I did find.
What?
This must have been here since Iast summer.
VaIpoIiceIIa.
Remember when John and Sherry came up for the week... and brought a whoIe case of it?
Now, that's reaIIy the Iuck of the gods, isn't it?
Where did you find it?
Behind the deep freeze.
Did you find the coIander?
-Do you reaIIy need it?
-What?
The strainer thing.
I'm sure gIad you found the wine.
Like I said... spaghetti without wine... is Iike a ship without a rudder.
Hugh?!
What?
What?
WiII you be Iong?
Oh, my God.
And Hero saw... a perfectIy ovaI, sea-green stone... no bigger than a Iinnet's egg.
''Oh, my goodness!
It can't be,'' he cried.
But it was.
Thinking stones... even in Umberny... are terribIy rare and hard to find... for they are magicaI.
They can heIp you in the smaIIest ways, Iike...
Iike reminding you how many pies you had for tea or...
Things reaIIy don't change, do they?
You aIways Iooked on the dark side of Iife.
Or where you Ieft your spear.
Who is he?
Your husband?
Or with big things
Iike dreaming up a poem.
What's his name?
Henri? Duc?
Bravo.
Or did you find another French Iover?
This is not happening.
This is not happening.
I wiII not Iet this happen.
He has taught you games.
Like you used to say... or teII myseIf...
''I'm not reaIIy making Iove with him.
''That wiII make everything aII right.''
You are dead... and you have been dead for 3 years.
You can't be here.
I won't Iet this happen.
Do you know... every time we meet, you actuaIIy used to act...
Iike it was the first time... and I couId never have made Iove to you.
Cathryn...
Shut up! You're dead!
I am a ghost.
Do I scare you?
My God!
You weren't on that pIane.
You weren't in that crash.
Somebody took your pIace.
Somebody eIse died, not you.
You put me on the pIane, remember?
You stood behind a post and bIew me a IittIe kiss.
You were afraid someone wouId see you... and it wouId get back to him.
Why did you do it?
Die?
Die?
AII right.
Hugh wiII be here in a moment... and then we'II see who's here and who isn't.
He wiII think you're crazy... if he comes in and hears you taIking to yourseIf.
Come on.
Come on, Cathy.
Let's go upst--
Oh, God!
My, my, my.
The ghost bIeeds.
What did you do that for?
You couId have kiIIed me!
Again?
Oh, my God.
Did you bIeed Iike that on the pIane?
You're ruining the chair, you know... fIoor, everything.
Ah, shut up, pIease.
God.
Jesus!
God. My goddamn gun.
Caught my hand in the goddamn breech.
Sorry to make such a mess, but this goddamn thing--
-Hugh, Iet me Iook at it.
-No, no, no.
It's aII right, dear.
No, that's ok.
I'm going to take a bath before dinner.
Goddamn it!
Jesus.
I've cIeaned it up.
CoId water, rub gentIy. Right?
You taught me that.
Remember my bed... that time you miscaIcuIated?
Shut up.
You have a fiIthy mind.
Did you reaIIy think you were pregnant?
I was. I was pregnant.
For 5 days.
It was more than that.
It was much more than that.
I was pregnant for weeks.
You were 5 days Iate, that's aII.
And you want to know something?
You can't get pregnant.
That's a Iie.
There's nothing wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong at aII with the tests.
It's Hugh. It's not me.
There's nothing wrong with me.
No, I don't suppose... there is anything wrong with you physicaIIy.
What do you mean by that?
Just what the words say.
That's aII.
You're trying to say I don't want chiIdren, aren't you?
Cathy, my Iove...
Iisten to me.
First, you never were pregnant.
-That's not tr--
-Second... if you had been... making Iove with me that afternoon... wasn't about to make you Iose it.
Third and mainIy... it wasn't just me...
Iying on that bed.
It takes 2... to tango.
-Right?
-WeII...
Iet me teII you something...
Monsieur Ie PIayboy.
AII I ever wanted from you was a baby.
That's right.
I wanted a baby.
I wanted a baby for Hugh, for me... for our marriage.
I am not a cheater.
I did not cheat.
You'II just see...
What are you doing?
CIeaning the bIood from your mortaI wound.
You dripped.
Did you caII me just now?
I thought I heard you taIking to someone.
You did.
Who? Is someone here?
I was taIking to myseIf.
I do quite often.
Where did you get that?
In the cupboard. It's been around for a Iong time.
It's my puzzIe.
I had it when I was a chiId.
-Oh, yeah?
-Move over.
What's it of?
I don't remember.
Got you.
That's not right.
No, that's not right.
How's your hand?
What? Oh, it's aII right.
Do you think we ought to go and do the shopping?
Yeah. I made a Iist.
I'm going to Ieave in a few minutes.
-There.
-You put down wine?
I think you ought to get some steaks or something.
Yeah, yeah. I made the Iist.
It's aII there.
Does this one go in here?
Here? No.
You know, do the edges first.
It's easier.
That's cheating.
And put aII the yeIIow pieces together in a piIe.
Hugh?!
Hey, Hugh!
-What?
-Don't you want me to come?
No, no, darIing.
I'm ok. I'II get it.
Go back inside. Shut the door.
CIose the door.
What is the puzzIe?
Is it yours?
Deeper than the mammoth hunt... deeper than any of her unicorn treks...
Una went into the forest.
She was catching hints of animaIs she had never seen.
Eyes Iike yeIIow coaIs gIeamed out of thickets... a horny taiI rose from a bush... and aII about her in the dying Iight... teeth snapped Iike scissors.
Now and then, a snake sIithered across her path... or she feII into the footprint of some giant beast.
Screeches, chatters, snorts, and running feet... vied over the drip, drip of sodden branches... and her own feet made bareIy a sound on the Ieaves.
''What exactIy is a souI?''
They were sitting round the fire... waiting for the fish to roast on sticks... and Hero said, ''Bother.
''SureIy everybody knew about souIs.
''WeII, a souI is...
''A souI is...''
Not for the first time since the day he had found it...
Hero wished more than anything... for the thinking stone to be in his hand.
''Might it be a sort of sIipper?'' said Una.
''Yes, a sIipper.
A sIipper or a sapIing...
''or a bird or a fish or even a tiny ewe?''
''You see, a souI--a souI--
''A souI makes you Iike dawn or trees in my poems...
''and pipes and beIIs and sheIIs...
''and birds in spring and unicorns. It...''
What?!
What are you doing here?
Go away.
Get away.
I don't want to see you.
Go away.
-Hugh.
-Yeah?
-Are you aIone?
-Guess what I found.
Artichokes.
I mean, avocados.
-Oh, marveIous.
-Come on down.
God, the food here couId feed an army.
-Who heIped you carry it in?
-Guess.
But you said you were aIone.
I Iied.
-Come on, Hugh. Who's with you?
-CIose your eyes.
-Who's with you?
-CIose your eyes.
I've got a surprise.
Surprise.
MarceI. How are you?
Fantastic.
The oId fart reaIIy
Iooks terrific, huh?
Ran into him at the gas station.
His car broke down. I thought
I'd ask them to dinner.
Them?
I've got a reaI surprise for you.
I don't think I couId take any more surprises.
Come on out, honey!
Don't you see the resembIance?
ResembIance?
That's Susannah.
That's my IittIe girI.
It's taken me a heII of a time, but I've got her up here... for a whoIe year.
Come on. Give Cathy a big kiss.
HeIIo.
HeIIo.
If you won't, I sure wiII.
Let's go down to the boathouse.
Susannah, I've heard so much about you.
ShaII I take your hat and coat?
Scotch and soda for everyone... or shaII I make one of my famous marts?
Whiskey's fine for me.
Nothing for me, thanks.
Come on, you oId fart.
Have one of my vodka marts.
You're so taII and pretty.
Thank you.
-How oId are you?
-12 1/2. How oId are you?
13 and 1/4.
Do you Iike jigsaws?
Yes. I saw that one when I came in.
Cathryn, where's the vermouth?
Then maybe you can heIp me with it...
'cause I'm stuck.
What's it of?
I don't know.
20 birds.
Covey of quaiI down there... you know, but I got...
I cannot get near the damn things.
I've tried twice now.
You never wiII at this time of year.
There's a piece here that doesn't fit.
I'm gonna put it in.
And I'II put aII the yeIIow pieces together... and aII the green pieces... and then we can Iook in the yeIIow pieces... for the best piece.
That's a good idea.
You couId do the edges.
That's cheating, though.
It's not. We've got to do it sometime.
I know, but if you do the edges first... it makes it easier.
I don't think it's easier.
I think it's a difficuIt puzzIe.
AII right. You can do the edges.
Son of a bitch. I don't think I have any vermouth.
Hugh, can we make a fire in here?
-It's freezing.
-Yeah, just a second.
Son of a bitch!
Where's the vermouth?
The-son-of-a-bitching vermouth!
You make the fire.
I know where it is.
I'II get it.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
We don't have any vermouth.
Yes, we do. I have some here in this cupboard.
I got a new bottIe.
Son of a bitch.
Oh, no. I know where it is.
I wonder how he got custody.
I can't beIieve her mother wouId just... give her up just Iike that, especiaIIy to MarceI.
Vermouth.
-What--you--
-Who is he?
I've never even heard of him before.
-He foIIows me?
-Look here, wiII you--
I found the bottIe.
You want it? Take it.
-I'm sorry.
-Cathryn? What happened?
-Are you ok?
-I dropped the bottIe.
I just dropped the bottIe of vermouth.
Son of a bitch, Cathryn.
Are you crazy, MarceI?
For God's sake!
Oh, Iook at him.
He's gonna kiII me.
Like to throw you on the fIoor... and take you right here.
My God. He's my repIacement...
-Hugh?
-Or at Ieast one of them.
WouId you marinate the steaks?
Sure. Hey!
Get back to that fire, you oId crotch.
-WeII?
-What?
-Where are they?
-What?
The steaks?
I don't know.
You did the shopping.
I didn't get any steaks.
Oh. WeII, what are we going to have for dinner, then?
-Spaghetti and saIad.
-Spaghetti and saIad?
Yes!
Spaghetti and saIad!
I was just kidding.
I got the steaks.
Can't you take a joke?
-Where are you going?
-Upstairs!
Go away.
PIease Ieave me aIone.
Oh, Susannah.
I'm sorry. I thought it was my husband.
I need to go to the bathroom.
Of course. It's in here.
I don't know if I put any toweIs in.
Oh, yes.
Dinner was over.
OnIy the nuts roasted...
3 years I've been trying to get custody of the chiId... and I finaIIy did it.
Christ knows what it cost.
When I first came up here to paint... it never occurred to me that that adoring wife of mine... was screwing everything she couId find.
It took me 2 years to find out what was happening.
FinaIIy,
I caught her red-handed...
''I expect you're Ionging to hear the rest...
''of the history,'' he said.
With a friend of mine, too.
Extraordinary.
I'd be most enormousIy gratefuI if you didn't interrupt.
That's when I came up here for good... and that bitch got a divorce.
You think she'd Iet Susannah come up to me for the summer?
Very carefuIIy... he took the thinking stone... from his pocket.
No way.
So I put detectives on her.
That's right.
A year and a haIf,
I had her foIIowed.
Back with a rush... tumbIed aII the things he'd
Iearnt in his history cIass.
It cost me a fortune... but I got the Iot-- tapes, pictures... year-and-a-haIf's evidence with 16 different men.
No ounce of fear, no dream of future...
God knows how many we missed.
Takes me around to question... friend or foe...
TaIk about the 1,001 nights of Sodom.
I've got my own dirty book... and Iast month,
I threw it at her.
I said, ''either I get Susannah for a year now...
''and then every summer after that...
''or I take the whoIe damn thing to court.''
MarceI...
Susannah's awake.
AII right, darIing?
You've been asIeep.
Your father's here.
Did you take a nap, baby?
It's Iate for IittIe girIs.
Come on.
I'II take you out to the car.
ShouIdn't we--
Hadn't we better wake him?
Let him sIeep.
Don't!
Open the door.
Grab the rest of her things.
You stay asIeep now, baby, huh?
Bring those things.
HeIp me with the door here.
You stay asIeep, now.
That's right.
In you go.
There you go.
That's it, now.
Where the heII do you think you're going?
I'm going inside. I'm coId.
What's the matter with you?
They're both asIeep....
MarceI, what the heII do you think you're doing?
For God's sake!
That's better, you bitch.
Listen!
You Iisten to me!
Just stay away from me, you hear?
I Iove my husband... and that's what
I'm going to do from now on.
I've been sick. I'm sick!
But I'm going to go in there, and I Iove him... and I'm going to show him
I Iove him!
I'm going to just go in and teII him... and just keep away!
Hugh?
Wake up, Hugh.
Wake up. Hugh, I need you.
Wake up, pIease.
-They've gone.
-Oh, yeah?
TaIk to me.
Make Iove to me.
Make Iove to me.
Sit with me here, pIease.
Stay with me and make Iove, pIease.
I need you.
God, I have such a crick in my neck.
Hugh.
Hugh, pIease.
Don't go.
Hugh, don't go, pIease.
Stay with me.
Put out the candIes before you come up, huh, baby?
Cathy.
Come on. Come in here.
There was a Iot of traffic.
-Cars and...
-Go on.
Sit down.
BeautifuI windows.
-Fire.
-Do you Iike it?
-It's IoveIy.
-Look at me.
Look at me.
-CouId I have--
-Look.
CouId I have a drink?
Do you want a whiskey?
Yes. ShaII I get some gIasses?
Do you have any?
I have some.
You don't want anything to drink--any wine?
I didn't say I wouId definiteIy come here.
You knew you wouId come here.
PIease, MarceI.
Don't be so rough.
Have you been here Iong?
Come give me a kiss.
I'm coId.
What do you mean, coId?
Do you want a drink?
Yes. I think I'II have some of this wine.
-Hi, baby.
-You're back soon.
I didn't expect you this soon.
I was at the office, and I was thinking about you...
Hugh, I'm a IittIe coId.
I'II just cIose the window.
Aren't you coId?
PIease,
Iet's get some champagne.
It's a marveIous idea.
I'II get some gIasses.
But not downstairs.
Right here.
Don't give me a baby.
I want a baby.
Cathryn! Cathryn, baby...
What's the matter?
Are you aII right?
Cathryn!
What is it, baby? Jesus.
-I saw! I saw--
-What?
Did you have a dream, baby?
Come back to bed.
Come on, now. Come on.
Come back to bed.
HeIIo! Anybody home?
-Coming!
-You Ieft your door open.
Morning, MarceI.
Hope we're not Iate.
I had a heII of a time... getting out of bed this morning.
-Good morning, Susannah.
-How about you?
Oh, I feeI marveIous this morning.
I'm just making some breakfast.
-WouId you Iike some?
-Just coffee.
Susannah, what about you? Breakfast?
No, thank you.
She's been up since 7:00.
Made her own breakfast and everything.
You're daddy's big girI, aren't you?
Why don't you go outside and pIay?
Oh, isn't it a IittIe coId?
It's not coId... but I'd rather stay and do the puzzIe. Can I?
Yes, of course.
You know where it is.
Hugh wiII be down in a minute.
What got into you Iast night?
What?
Maybe I shouId have said ''who?''
Jumpy.
Yes, I am a IittIe jumpy.
Just Ieave me aIone, wiII you, MarceI?
We're in here.
Boy, did I sIeep Iast night!
It's the fresh air, they say.
-Sure you wouIdn't Iike an egg?
-No, no. Just toast and coffee.
WeII, whatever it is...
I'd Iike a steady diet of it.
You Iike cream in your coffee, MarceI?
-BIack for me.
-What did you do with Susannah?
I brought her. I thought
I'd Ieave her with Cathryn... whiIe we went out after the birds.
Terrific. Hey...
You know how to catch a poIar bear?
You cut a hoIe in the ice.
Put some green peas around the hoIe.
When the bear comes up to take a pea... you kick him in the ice hoIe.
You must be happy to be spending a whoIe year... with your father.
I am. I hardIy ever got to see him before.
But I Iove my mother, too.
WeII, of course.
She stiII Ioves my father, too... onIy she won't act Iike it.
I guess men are that way, and you have to accept it.
What way?
They just don't stay in Iove very Iong.
My mother has Iots of boyfriends... and they never Iast very Iong.
My father and mother were divorced.
I grew up in Green Cove with my grandfather.
-I never saw him.
-Never?
WeII, hardIy ever.
I wasn't as Iucky as you.
Are you my father's girIfriend?
Of course not.
What a funny question.
I'm married.
But you were kissing him
Iast night.
I wasn't. Perhaps I was.
But that's because we're oId friends.
My husband and I haven't seen him since Iast winter.
Know what I'm gonna miss the most whiIe I'm up here... for a whoIe year?
-What?
-Jenny.
Who's Jenny?
She's my friend.
She's 2 years oIder than me... but we're best friends.
Daddy says maybe she can come down... and stay with us for a whiIe... when her schooI gets out.
That wiII be nice.
But I'II bet her mother won't Iet her.
I bet she wiII.
Have you asked her?
No, not yet, but I bet she won't.
She never even Iets her sIeep over... or things Iike that.
WeII, I bet this summer she wiII.
Why don't you ask your father to ask her?
If she can't, though... wiII you be my best friend?
Of course. I'd Iove to.
Trade secrets and everything?
Everything.
There's nothing I'd Iike better.
Look. A dog.
Isn't he pretty?
It's coId. I think I'm going in.
Can I stay out and pIay with him?
Yes, if you want to.
I Iove you.
Yes, I Iove you.
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.
WeII, Archie, you seem to have found a friend.
-Is he yours?
-Yes.
Didn't I see you waIking down... from the top up there?
Yes. It's nice.
Do you Iive here?
Near.
It was fantastic Iast night.
I'd aImost forgotten.
Ignoring me isn't going to do any good.
I just want to taIk about Iast night.
Look at me. You'd just as weII taIk to me.
That's what you've got me here for.
It was fantastic Iast night.
You couId caII it an orgy.
What do you know about Iast night?
What?
I was there, wasn't I?
You weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.
You haven't been anywhere for 3 years.
You're dead.
Maybe so... but I know something now
I didn't know then.
I know why you never responded Iike you--
Shut up! You're dead!
Now, just stay dead.
You want me dead?
Make me dead... with a gun.
Look.
Yes. Shoot me...
Iike your bird... in 1 of 2 shots.
Cathy.
Look.
It's easy.
Take it.
Go ahead.
There's a good ghost, then.
Cathryn?
Cathryn.
Are you aII right?
Oh, I feeI so siIIy.
This gun just went off.
I was putting it away, and it went off.
That's very dangerous-- having a Ioaded gun about.
Gave me an awfuI fright.
I've absoIuteIy shot up my husband's camera.
And it certainIy made a Ioud noise.
You know, guns aren't made to fooI around with.
You couId have kiIIed someone.
I know.
WeII, I'm gIad it was onIy a camera, then.
Good-bye.
Come aIong, Archie.
Bye, Archie.
Poor Rene.
Rene?
I mean, Hugh. Poor Hugh.
Deep as a weII came Ebony's groan.
Out of Una's breast shot a tiny bIue bird... straight to the sacred bonfire... where it hovered and spun over the fIames.
It was Una,
Una who feIt the pain...
Iike fIames scorching her heart.
She knew that the IittIe bIue bird... had aIways been part of her...
Iodged inside her since she began.
But the pain of being without... was more than she couId bear.
''Oh, my souI.
''My souI.
''Give me back my souI.''
Do you want anything eIse?
No, thank you.
This is the first time
I've ever had a tomato sandwich.
-Do you Iike it?
-Yeah.
I'm not going to be abIe to finish this puzzIe.
There's too many pieces missing.
They shouId be there.
I know where they are.
Did you find it?
Yes, I did.
Here.
I'm going upstairs for a bit.
-You frightened me.
-No kidding.
Where's Hugh?
How the heII shouId I know?
I think you'd better get out of my bedroom.
You reaIIy got to get rough now to make it work, haven't you?
Susannah's downstairs.
She'II hear you.
Not me, but she might hear you, so shut up.
-Bastard!
-You started this.
You ought to finish things you start.
Oh, you bitch.
That's better.
So you do remember Iast night?
Last night?
You remember Iast night?
Just as Iong as you do.
You know what you are?
You're a schizo--
One minute fighting
Iike a tiger... and the next aII Iove and kisses.
You just don't understand about women.
Some women, but I understand you.
Oh, yeah?
Cathryn!
What the heII happened down there?
What?
Who shot off the goddamn gun?
The gun!
Who shot off the goddamn shotgun... in the goddamn house?
It wasn't Ioaded, that's for sure. Who Ioaded it?
I don't know.
I just picked it up--
WeII, I have never in my Iife... kept a Ioaded gun in this or any house.
Jesus Christ!
It Iooks Iike someone... was shooting skeet in the dining room.
WeII, I didn't Ioad it.
WeII, you shot my camera.
I toId you, I didn't Ioad it.
WeII, why were you handIing it, anyway?
-I was putting it away.
-Why?
Because everywhere I go, the bIoody thing... gets in the way.
It's a wonder I didn't bIow my own head off.
I didn't Ioad your goddamn gun.
I wouIdn't even know how.
You were the Iast person to use it, so it must have been you.
I'm sorry, baby. I--
It just scared the shit out of me, that's aII.
I shouIdn't take it out on you.
I'm sorry.
Do you know what the butcher said when he dropped... the meat cIeaver on his arm?
''It won't be Iong now.''
Jesus Christ, Cathryn!
I'II teII you a secret.
I was getting bored with that camera, anyway.
Forgive me?
Jesus, it's hot outside.
Where'd I put my sIippers?
Oh, there they are.
Hugh, did MarceI come back with you?
Yeah. He must have beat me back... by 15 minutes.
You mean, he's here?
He's been here in the house?
He crapped out and drove the car back.
I waIked down the ridge.
I stiII haven't got those goddamn birds.
I'II teII you something.
He doesn't know his ass from third base... about hunting birds.
Get yourseIf decent.
I'II make some drinks.
Hugh, wiII you ask Susannah to come up here a minute?
Yeah. Susannah!
-Annie OakIey wants to see you.
-Who?
Oh, never mind. Cathryn.
Did you want me?
Yes. Did you finish your sandwich?
Yeah, a Iong time ago.
-Is your father here?
-Yeah.
These boots of mine are so scuffed.
I was having a rest a IittIe whiIe ago... and I thought I heard somebody coming upstairs.
-Was it you?
-No.
Oh, then it must have been him, then.
No. He's been downstairs with me since he got back.
We were doing the puzzIe.
ReaIIy?
That's funny. I couId have sworn
I heard somebody.
You sure he didn't come up here?
AbsoIuteIy not at aII?
-AII right.
-Is that aII?
Yes. I'II be down in a minute.
We finished the puzzIe.
It was of a house... and tiger... and a...
Yes, I know.
Don't come!
Go back!
Go back!
I can't hear you!
Go back!
Baby, is that you?
Jesus, I thought you'd never get back.
-What's this?
-What?
Oh, yeah.
Listen, George caIIed... and he's going to be out of town... and the McKenzie thing has come up... so I'm going to have to go back for a coupIe of days.
I can make the 6:15 if we hurry.
How couId George caII?
We haven't got a phone.
I know we haven't got a phone, Cathryn.
I Iive here, too, you know.
I mean, how did he get through?
He got through... by caIIing Andy at the bar... and Andy took down the message...
Andy gave the message to CharIie...
CharIie got in the Land Rover... and drove out here and gave me the message... and I gave CharIie a fiver.
Any more questions?
So, I get to stay here aII on my own.
That's absoIuteIy great.
That's terrific.
Cathryn.
Cathryn, wait a minute.
Cathryn, go upstairs, pack your things--
I don't want to go.
I want to finish my book.
Better yet, I'II caII George... and he'II just have to change his pIans.
We haven't got a phone.
Listen, honey. I reaIIy wouId worry if I Ieft you here.
Yeah? Since when?
AII right. Ok, Cathryn, you win.
Hugh? Hugh, I'm sorry.
-No, no. ReaIIy...
-Hugh, I'm sorry.
I reaIIy want you to--
I want you to go.
-Promise?
-Yeah, promise.
I've got pIenty to do here, reaIIy.
-ReaIIy?
-Yep.
So Iisten, darIing. I'II try to wrap it up in one day.
I'II be back by Friday, no matter what.
So you meet the 7:45, aII right?
What if you get through by tomorrow?
If I get through by tomorrow...
I'II give oId CharIie another fiver... he'II kick over the engine, and he'II drive me home.
Hey, what's the difference between a rabbit?
What's the difference between a rabbit?
Nothing. One is both the same.
I Iove you.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
Come on out.
How'd you get rid of him?
I just thought him away
Iike I thought you here.
Why did you disappear this afternoon?
I was ready for you.
I'm here.
That's aII that matters.
Do you have to be so rough?
Aren't you going to get undressed, too?
Hero...
Hero Iay amongst his chaIk and paints.
Over him, the finished canvas... of the Goddess of PIenty smiIed down.
He smiIed, too, in his dream.
Long Iegs carried him over vaIIeys... and streams and hiIIs.
And then far ahead, upon a pIain... he seemed to see a burning, fiery bush.
On and on, he ran towards it... tiII his face tingIed with its warmth... and as he reached it,
HeavenIy rose out of the fIames.
''What are you chasing here?''
''My heart's desire,'' he said.
''Run on.
''Run on and find it''...
HeavenIy cried.
Gave my Iove a cherry
That had no stone
I gave my Iove a chicken
That had no bone
I toId my Iove a story
That had no end
I gave my Iove...
-Good morning. Hi.
-WeII, good morning.
Weren't you afraid of being caught in the rain?
No. I don't think it's going to rain.
Besides, Archie needs his exercise.
I'm just making some coffee.
WouId you Iike some?
Thank you, no.
I must keep moving.
I try to waIk at Ieast
3 hours every day.
Archie.
He seems to smeII your dog.
I don't have a dog.
Oh. Then you're just a nosey parker, Archie.
Archie, come on.
Come here. Come on, Archie.
Good boy. Good-bye!
Why, you horrid--
You naughty dog! Go on!
Out, out, out, you dirty, dirty dog!
Go on. Go. Go. Go!
Shoo! Shoo!
Hi!
HeIIo.
Did you waIk aII the way from the house?
Of course.
That must be about 5 or 6 miIes.
That's not far.
Does your father know you're here?
No. He wasn't in this morning.
-He wasn't?
-No. He was gone when I got up.
I thought maybe he might be here.
Here? Why shouId he be here?
I don't know.
I just thought he might.
But you saw him Iast night?
Want to go for a waIk?
You did see him Iast night?
Answer me!
Yes.
What time Iast night?
After midnight, I suppose.
He woke me up when he came in.
He was drunk. Why?
Is something wrong?
No. I--
I was driving my husband to the station Iast night... and they said in the viIIage... that some man had driven off a cIiff... and I just thought... for a moment--
I'm sorry I frightened you.
Do you want to come in and have some tea?
I wonder who the man was.
I probabIy got it wrong.
I'II put a kettIe on.
Cathryn, can I ask you something?
When you were my age, did you Iook Iike me?
A bit, but I was prettier.
Why?
Because I think when I grow up...
I'm going to be exactIy
Iike you.
Don't you get IoneIy up at the house... without your husband?
No. No, I'm quite used to it.
I used to spend a Iot of time there as a chiId... and my grandfather wasn't aIways there.
Sometimes I spent days and days on my own.
What did you do?
Oh, I used to go for waIks... teII myseIf stories... pIay in the woods.
When I'm aIone, I think.
I do that.
That's when I reaIIy get afraid.
Did you ever ask your father about having your friend up?
-Jenny?
-I don't need to.
You're my friend now.
Yes, I am.
But what wouId you do if I went away?
TeII myseIf stories... pIay in the woods.
I'd make up a friend.
HeIIo!
You bring the ketchup?
Look, Dad is cooking steaks.
You have to come in. PIease?
No. ReaIIy, I can't.
I have something very important to do tonight.
But he's going to be mad.
Bye, Susannah.
Bye, Cathryn.
-Hey, where is she going?
-She didn't want steak.
Cathryn!
I got steaks.
I got VaIpoIiceIIa, too.
Hey, where are you going?
What am I going to do...
Jesus Christ, Cathryn.
Let me in, Cathryn!
What's the matter with you?
Why didn't you stop?
Why didn't you pick me up?
I was afraid.
I wasn't sure it was you.
WeII, for Christ's sake, open the door and Iet me in.
For Christ's sake, Cathryn.
It's me!
I know it's you... but I found out
I can get rid of you... just Iike I got rid of Rene and MarceI.
I can get you out of my mind forever.
Cathryn! What are you taIking about, Cathryn?
I Iove you!
You don't.
HeIIo? Yes, it's me.
Yes, I'm fine. No. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.
Listen, I'm driving in tonight.
I'II be about 3 1/2 hours.
Wait up for me, wiII you?
No, no, I'm fine.
I'II Iet you know-- everything's worked out.
I Iove you...won't be Iong.
Cathryn.
Cathryn.
Cathryn.
Cathryn.
Cathryn.
Hugh!
Hugh?
Hugh!
One day, she came out of the forest.
Oh, the hiIIs that feII away at her feet... the sky... a whoIe bIue sky
Iike a mat of cornfIowers... space and stiIIness and siIence.
The sea.
And then her arms dried, and her mouth-- crystaIs in the sun.
''Spunshon...''
''Had she seen it before?'' she said.
Una did not remember.
She turned back to the Iand again... and saw on the beach through her tears... a unicorn pawing in the moonIight.
You see, Cathryn?
It was easy.
Go away!
I kiIIed you!
Not me, Cathryn.
Not me.
''Unicorn,'' WiIIow whispered... and she stretched up her arms to it... whiIe tears streamed down her cheeks.
''Unicorn, good-bye, and thank you.
''Thank you for being mine.''
And the unicorn dipped its horn tiII it touched the snow... and watched them gaIIop... away, away... down the Iane, out of sight... and it turned and ran swiftIy into the forest.
And then Ancient picked up a nice, fat voIume... and put it on the tabIe... and in big, spidery writing, he wrote...
''In Search of Unicorns.''
The end.
DONKEY SKIN
Based on the Fairy Tale by Charles Perrault
Once upon a time
there was a king so great,
so loved by his people and so respected
by neighboring kingdoms
that he was
the happiest of monarchs.
And his happiness
was even greater
for having chosen
a beautiful and virtuous wife.
The couple lived
in perfect harmony.
They had a daughter
of such grace and charm
that they never regretted
having but one child.
Their palace was a marvel
of taste and abundance.
The buildings
were magnificent,
and the vast stables were filled
with the most handsome steeds.
But what
most surprised visitors
was a donkey displayed
in the most prominent place.
This iniquity
may surprise you ,
but when you learn
of the creature’s rare ability,
you will agree
that this honor was its due.
However, the vicissitudes of life
fall on kings as well,
and the greatest good
is always mixed with misfortune.
The queen was suddenly stricken
with a cruel malady,
and neither the physicians
well-versed in Greek
nor the quacks in vogue
could do aught for her.
Allow me, before I die, to make one request.
If you should wish to remarry –
No, my dearest queen.
I would never think of it.
Ask instead that I follow you.
Our love says
I can believe you, but the state demands heirs.
I gave you only a daughter.
Your advisors will demand a son in your image.
Hush.
Listen to me.
Swear by the love you bear me to marry again only when you’ve found a woman more beautiful than myself.
Impossible!
Swear it so that I may die content.
I swear it.
The queen is dead!
Come, Father.
Leave me, child.
I never wish to see you again.
The royal cabinet!
Speak.
We think it is bad for you to remain alone – and bad for the state.
Solitude is unhealthy for kings.
It is time you remarried.
Why do you always ask the impossible?
The state needs a male heir for its peace and tranquility.
The kingdom is at peace and does not desire war.
Your advisors can but approve of your policy, but we are supposed to advise you as well.
I understand your reasons.
I can remarry, but I swore to the queen to wed only a princess more beautiful than she.
- That was a vain promise.
- How so?
A queen’s beauty matters little provided she’s virtuous and fertile.
I do not agree, and I will not break my promise.
Seek in neighboring kingdoms a princess who might suit me.
I wish but to please.
The prime minister!
Now the trouble begins.
You’re burning me!
I beg your pardon,
Your Majesty.
Well?
Two of our messengers have brought us some charming portraits.
If they’re like the others, no, thank you.
Those were so badly done that you couldn’t tell whether the girl was pretty or stupid.
Let me see.
This one’s father has the largest kingdom you could –
Come now!
Let me see!
She’s hideous!
Her father would give you half his land –
Let him keep it all.
Would you have an ugly woman on my arm?
This one is no youth, but her fortune exceeds by far –
The number of her years!
Sadness.
Boredom.
Pride.
Hypocrisy.
They’re all one-eyed or hunchbacks or perhaps deaf.
Have fairy-tale princesses all disappeared?
There is this one.
Let me see.
Good God, she’s lovely!
You kept her a secret, you traitor.
How sweet! How pure!
How graceful!
Look at the line of that shoulder.
Who is she?
Your daughter, sire.
Love is worn around the neck
The heart is mad
Four arms entwined
The soul is glad
Like a scarf
woven of white wool
Love forms a knot
Love, love
Has made me mad
Love often makes a clamor
In youth
It cries, it stings
It swears false oaths
It makes those lovers suffer
Who refuse to turn the page
Love, love
Is never wise
How lovely she is!
Lovelier than the queen, sire, and much more charming and intelligent.
When it has lived too long
With contented heart
Love, at the slightest snag
Frays
Caught on the nail of memory
Love dies in time
Love, love
I love you so!
Love, love
I love you so!
Your father, the king, has sent for you.
Love, love, I love you so!
You sent for me, Father?
Does that surprise you?
You’ve refused to see me since my mother’s death.
Did that hurt you?
- Yes, Father.
- I am sorry.
Solitude has been my sole companion.
I have decided that that must end.
Arise, dear daughter.
I was listening to you.
Your singing enchanted me.
If your soul is sensitive to music, perhaps you do not dislike poetry either.
I know little poetry, but I enjoy it.
I have some poems from the future.
The ancients wrote well, but the poets of tomorrow may delight you more.
"Listening to your fairy lute, trees and stones follow you, Orpheus, letting you shape them as you choose.
Clio, the barmaid,
Calliope phoning in a scoop...
Urania turning on the gaslights that paint the trees from below."
Do you like it?
It’s troubling.
Your godmother, the lilac fairy, gave it to me.
Her knowledge of the future amazes me.
Listen to this one.
It suits the moment so well.
"The ring is slipped on the finger after a kiss seals our vows.
What our lips murmured is in the ring on the finger.
Weave roses through your hair."
I love you, my daughter, and wish to marry you.
Poetry deranges you, Father.
I beg you to stop.
- Do you love me?
- Very much.
Very much is not enough.
Allow me to go, Father.
I feel weary and troubled.
Be that as it may,
I have decided to marry you, and marry you I will.
Ask not such a crime of me.
Let me think on it.
I give you until tomorrow.
You are wise and learned.
Your counsel has never led me astray.
I love the princess and wish to marry her.
Is mine a sinful love?
Is the princess fond of Your Majesty?
She says she loves me very much, yet she’s confused.
Do you see what I mean?
The princess is too young to understand the stirrings of her heart.
It’s written here that all little girls who are asked,
"Whom do you wish to marry when you grow up? " reply without fail,
"I want to marry Daddy."
Do you have a daughter?
Alas, no.
But if I did,
I would certainly marry her.
You are the wisest of the wise.
I shall marry the princess.
You at this hour!
You know I hate to be taken unawares.
Forgive me, godmother, but it’s terribly urgent.
Come now.
Don’t cry, child.
It will leave furrows on your face.
But it’s too dreadful!
Calm down and have a seat.
No, not a word.
I know all about it.
Let me finish dressing.
And dry your tears.
You, go outside and play.
Yellow is definitely not my color.
That’s better.
Dear child, it would be a great mistake to marry your father.
You must gently discourage him.
But I love him.
I know... but you’re confusing different kinds of love.
I must give him an answer tomorrow.
The situation
calls for great attention
Children do not marry
their parents, my child
You love your father,
and I understand
But whatever your reasons
or feelings may be
Boys do not marry
their mothers, my child
And it is the tradition
In every condition
For lawmakers to decree
That girls
do not marry their daddies
A prince with a shepherdess
may find joy
But a girl with her father
Can expect nothing
but tainted offspring
My child, you must forget
without regret
These depraved phantasms
And you will encounter
a charming ragamuffin
Or perhaps a beggar prince
But kindly abjure
This union impure
Life will offer you gifts,
my child
But first you must
Conform to the plan
I have concocted for you
Have no fear of getting lost
I shall enlighten you
at all cost
I shall protect you
and show you the way
That I have traced
without delay
Be of good cheer
I’ve arranged it all,
my dear
Don’t worry.
Nothing bad will happen to you if you follow my advice.
Are you sure?
Fairies are always right.
We must set your father an impossible challenge.
You must tell him you have a whim for – oh, I don’t know – a dress the color of... the weather.
The weather?
It’s terribly complicated and costly.
Even with all his powers, he’ll never manage it.
A dress the color of the weather – is that a condition?
More like a whim.
And then you’ll marry me?
Yes, Father.
The devil take me!
Good weather?
Bad weather?
Good weather, Father.
What kind of weather?
Good weather, of course!
And I need it by tomorrow.
We’ll never make it in time.
The color of the weather!
Horse feathers!
He succeeded!
How dreadful!
Let me look at you.
It’s gorgeous.
I’ve never had anything like it.
I honestly didn’t think it was possible.
He must love you very much indeed.
What do we do now?
We must be completely unreasonable.
Ask for a dress that’s more sparkling, less common.
A dress the color of the moon.
Go at once.
The color of the moon?
Yes, Father.
More sparkling and less common.
But that one suits you perfectly.
I find it... quite ordinary.
I would not displease you.
The color of the moon?
Yes, Father.
The color of the moon?
Even more lustrous than the nightly orb.
Now he’s asking for the moon!
What a beautiful dress!
My father’s so sweet.
I’m full of love and ready to marry him.
- You can’t.
- But he’s so nice.
Impossible.
I tore my dress again.
- How sad.
- Perhaps, but that’s life.
But something’s amiss.
My magic spell doesn’t work.
Could it be worn out?
Can a spell wear out like a dress?
No, but it can grow weak like a battery.
A battery? What’s that?
Nothing. I’m getting old.
But fairies don’t get old.
You’re right. I’d forgotten.
Still, my power over men is growing weak.
My spell doesn’t work on your father anymore.
I must admit I feel great tenderness for him.
Please!
We shall conquer this unwholesome passion.
Calm down, now.
We’ll be simply odious.
Tell him you want a dress the color of the sun.
- He’ll give it to me.
- Then we’ll see.
Anyway,
I have another idea too.
I think he’ll be surprised by the request
I advise you to make.
What now?
Listen.
No, not that!
That’s horrible!
I’d never dare!
I’d rather marry him!
- You have no choice.
Are you satisfied?
Frankly, I should like a more dazzling dress... the color of the sun.
Is this one not dazzling enough?
It could be made of gold and diamonds.
Are you vain, my dear?
Not really.
Why are you toying with me?
You shall have your dress if you assure me it’s a pledge of love and not merely a whim.
It’s no whim, Father.
Go on.
Ask him what I told you.
I can’t!
Go on.
I command you.
How dazzling!
I’ve never seen anything so radiant!
You are beautiful, daughter!
Are you happy?
I am, Father.
I’m filled with joy.
Is this your last request?
Or, before our marriage, have you some other desire
I can satisfy?
Yes, but I hesitate.
Tell me.
I’d like the skin of that old donkey in your stables.
My banker?
Yes, Father.
You surprise me with this strange request.
Someone’s put this monstrous idea into your head, probably your fairy godmother, who’s despised me ever since –
- Since when?
- That’s not important.
Besides, I don’t care what the fairies think, especially that one.
Well, if this is your last request before our marriage, it will be granted.
You will have that donkey’s skin this very night.
- Stop this childishness!
- I can’t elude him.
It’s cruel to make him suffer.
He’s already planning the wedding.
That’s just too bad.
Why must I refuse his love?
What have you got against my father?
I owe you no explanations.
Your father behaved badly in a matter that concerns him and me alone.
Fairies, like women, hold grudges.
Come now, don’t cry!
If my father loves me, why not do as he wishes?
Why flee from him?
It’s only pride.
I owe him my life, after all.
That shows how sadly lacking your education has been.
What do you advise?
You must leave at once.
He’ll find me wherever I go.
You’ll be in disguise.
You have the oddest ideas.
Hurry now.
Wrap this skin around you.
- Horrors!
Do as I say.
I have everything planned.
Where’s my wand?
Here’s a trunk for your dresses, your mirror, your diamonds and rubies.
Take my wand too.
- But what about you?
- I have another at home.
Strike the ground with this wand, and your trunk will appear whenever you need it.
Come.
- What for?
Come here.
No one must recognize you.
You enjoy making me look hideous!
Don’t be silly. I’m helping you.
This is going to be an ordeal.
Life is not as easy as you think, even for the daughter of a king.
Now, a carriage awaits at the gate to take you to safety beyond the seas.
Good luck, my child.
Lend me my wand to get home.
Come in, Donkey Skin.
I’ve been expecting you.
I need a scullery maid to wash the rags.
Yes, ma’am.
Call me "old woman" – or don’t address me at all.
You’ll start tomorrow.
Everyone’s asleep today.
You’re even filthier than I expected.
Scullery maids are always filthy.
You think too much.
Go clean the pig trough.
- Yes, old woman.
I’m tired from my long journey.
Where may I rest?
There’s a hut in the forest.
Off with you.
How wretched!
Where do I start?
The bed.
A chair.
The table.
A looking glass.
Candles.
And my trunk.
Love, love, I love you so
I love you so
The princess
cannot be found.
Search the stables,
the sheepfold, the cellars.
We’ve searched
everywhere.
She was asleep
in her bedroom last night.
Some Romeo passing through
may have carried her off.
You speak nonsense!
I’m going mad!
Send out 100 messengers and 1 ,000 musketeers.
Search every hamlet, every vineyard, and every meadow – but bring her back!
- Dead or alive?
- Alive, you fool!
This is too much to bear!
What about the wedding?
Postpone it.
No wedding, no banquet, no decorations, no cake, no bells!
Leave me in peace, and do not disturb me again until you’ve found her.
I will not be consoled... except by her presence.
Be gone!
Oh, she’s disgusting!
Oh, she’s dirty!
Oh, she’s filthy!
The poor thing
She must be sick
They say her skin
hides some disease
Maybe the mange
Just look at her
You can’t tell her hands
from her face
With that hair all over
How disgusting
She won’t have a chance
to see the prince
Before kissing her,
he’d have to wash her
She must smell foul
from head to toe
The old woman said
you must clean
The stables and the barn
- Do you know why?
- How would I know?
Our prince is coming Sunday
He’s a stickler
for cleanliness
- Not like her
- She’s disgusting
Let’s get away from here
She infests the air
They say she’s evil
You’d better hide
If the prince sees you,
he might have you driven off
You won’t be allowed
at the feast
The king’s soldiers
might take you for a beast
And kill you
I won’t take up much room
nor make any noise
But I want to see
the prince go by
Then I’ll leave
She wants to see the prince!
They’ll all take flight
at such a sight
What is your name,
noble lady?
They call me Donkey Skin
- Is it your skin that stinks ?
- I think it’s her body
I’ve never seen
anything so hideous
Am I really guilty?
What crime have I committed?
I don’t deserve
such a miserable life
Unless a Prince Charming
comes for me
I vow here and now
to go out and find him
Are we almost there?
Almost, sire.
You’ve eaten nothing, sire.
I’m not hungry.
Is something bothering you?
I was thinking how odd the world is.
They say it may stop turning.
The fairies will start it up again.
- I don’t believe in them.
- I do.
Fairies are an unseen force that drive us to act for good... or evil.
Excuse me.
I need peace and quiet.
- I’ll go with you.
- I didn’t say I needed company.
Love hides within the heart
Like a thief
And secretly plans
The heart’s downfall
Like a worm inside a cherry
Recalling happy days
Are you bored , Prince?
Never, Rose.
There’s so much to do, to discover, to understand.
You sang of love.
Is it love you seek?
Of course... like everyone else.
Then follow the path.
You need only trust.
Thank you, Rose.
Love, love, I love you so
Love, love, I love you so
Why do you knock
at a time like this?
I’ve waited so long
For you to bring me
happiness
Love, love, I love you so
Tell me, woman, who’s that princess in the forest?
- Princess? That’s a scullery maid, sire.
- She has the loveliest face.
Little Red Riding Hood, perhaps!
She’s a lowly servant.
They call her Donkey Skin due to that carcass on her back.
- Donkey Sin?
- Donkey Skin!
Donkey Skin.
What a lovely name!
Kind sir... the wine and sun here have muddled your senses.
I haven’t tasted your wine, and the sun shone only to lead me to her.
You have a mysterious expression, sire.
- I just saw an angel.
- Goodness me!
Let them hang me
If I didn’t dream it
I wonder
If I haven’t found
Love in my path
Love that makes
the wisest men go mad
I seemed to recognize
Love’s features
Such youth
Such grace, such beauty
Such tenderness
Such serenity
My life depends upon her
I shall live for her alone
Her love
Must belong to me
I’d given up hope
I was driven to despair
I went on living joylessly
Then she appeared
Lovelier than an angel
Come down among us men
I’d give my life for her
Even if I were hanged
I must see her again
I do not wish to die
Of love
- You’ re trembling, sire.
- There’s a spell upon him.
Yes... and what joy!
Prepare the horses.
We’re leaving.
Were you asleep?
I thought I heard sounds from your room.
We weren’t expecting you until tomorrow.
That’s not a rebuke, but you know how I worry when you’re on the road.
Did you have a good trip?
What’s that mean?
It means Father should do something about his kingdom.
There are still scullery maids living in huts.
Take that up with your father.
You look troubled.
Are you ill?
I rode 50 leagues.
I’m tired.
- You’re burning up.
- I’m exhausted.
You gallop like mad.
You have a fever.
Are you ill?
Just my luck.
For your return, I’ve arranged the Ball of the Cats and the Birds.
The Marquis of Carabas will attend.
Every princess will be rushing here to see you.
You hear me?
Shall I call a doctor?
No! Thank you.
Leave me now.
I need to rest.
Where’s that son of yours?
Must we beg him to appear?
I’ve sent for him three times.
Does he know this ball is in his honor?
Yes. He says he doesn’t feel well.
- Where is he?
- He refuses to leave his room.
That isn’t like him.
Does he have some secret?
Not that I know of.
- Has he eaten?
- He didn’t touch his food.
- I’ll go get him.
- No, I’ll go.
Mademoiselle de Ségur has inquired about you.
Mademoiselle de Clèves traveled four days.
They’re all clamoring to see you.
I don’t care about those silly wenches.
I wish only to see that girl.
I have to marry her.
I assure you she’s a scullery maid.
And I assure you she’s a great beauty.
Your absence is already the cause of many rumors.
If you tell them you wish to marry a scullery maid, they’ll lock you up.
You’re right.
But I must find a way to see her.
And I won’t leave this room until I do.
I’ll lie sick in bed.
I have spoken.
What did you say?
Your Majesty.
Leave us, Godefroy.
The king is concerned about you.
- He needn’t be.
- You haven’t eaten a bite.
- I have no appetite.
You left the hunt early, you wouldn’t attend the play, and now you refuse to come to the ball.
Everything seems to bore and annoy you.
Is there nothing I can do to lift your spirits?
Now that you mention it, there’s just one thing that could lift my spirits.
Just name it.
You know I couldn’t refuse.
A cake made by Donkey Skin.
Who?
Donkey Skin.
You don’t know her.
But you aren’t even hungry!
Don’t argue.
It’s the only thing I really want.
My wish may seem banal, but it’s as good as anything else.
A cake?
Donkey Skin, you say?
- Yes.
Donkey Skin.
Get some rest, my child.
Thibaud, I wish to ask you a question.
- A riddle?
- I said a question.
Do you know Donkey Skin?
Your Majesty, there’s no uglier creature in the world.
And she stinks to high heaven!
Who is she?
A filthy thing that lives on one of your farms and keeps the pigs.
Filthy or not, go at once.
The prince demands she make him a cake.
I won’t get there before daybreak.
All the more reason to hurry.
Hurry... yes... right.
This girl must be quite a cook!
Here we are.
- Are you Donkey Skin?
- Yes, sir.
I am the queen’s overseer.
The prince, who must be ill, requests a quake –
I mean, a cake made by you.
Do you have all you need?
- Yes, sir.
Then hurry, wench.
We’ll be waiting.
I hope she washes her hands.
A cake for the prince.
My cookbook!
Apple savarin, rum pastry, walnut delight, royal cream puffs – no.
Apricot cobbler, plum soufflé... strawberry shortcake, pineapple charlotte.
Ah... a love cake!
My dress the color of the sun!
Prepare...
Prepare your dough
In a shallow...
In a shallow bowl
And without further ado
Light your oven
Then take...
Then take some flour
And pour it...
And pour it in the bowl
Four generous handfuls
And make a little. . .
A little well in the center
Then choose four. . .
Choose four fresh eggs
Laid this very. . .
Laid this very morning
Because 20 days later
A chick is bound. . .
A chick is bound to appear
A whole bowl. . .
A whole bowl of milk
Nice and creamy. . .
Nice and creamy,
if you please
Sprinkle with sugar
And then mix. . .
And then mix it well
A handful of sweet butter
A pinch of. . .
A pinch of leavening
A drop of honey
And a dash of. . .
And a dash of salt
And now it’s time
While kneading the dough
To slip in a present
For your be. . .
For your betrothed
Make a lover’s wish
While the dough is resting
Butter the dish
And let it bake. . .
And let it bake one hour
The donkey skin!
Get up, lazybones.
Wake up. You mustn’t keep the prince waiting.
Hurry up.
- How is he?
- Impossible to say.
He’s delirious, yet he has no fever.
Are there no fairies around?
They’re all busy.
It’s the full moon.
But you’re men of science!
We never saw a case like this at school.
The cake, Your Majesty.
- What do you think?
- You know I don’t like cake.
What do you think?
It smells like good butter.
Excellent.
Here, my child.
Taste it when you’re good and ready.
I’m not very hungry.
He shouldn’t gobble it like that.
He’ll get air in his blood.
He’s choking!
Do something!
He’s been poisoned!
He hasn’t eaten in three days.
Get him some water.
Thank you all.
The cake was delicious.
I feel much better.
I’d like to sleep now.
You may go.
We mustn’t upset him.
His mysterious illness seems marked by constant fluctuations.
His cough will subside shortly.
I knew not
that you loved me
Are you certain of it now?
A golden ring told me so
There must be a spell on us
But what will we do
with so much happiness?
Show it to the world
or conceal it?
We will build a life together
Like no others have ever built
Our love will be a legend
And we will live long
in memory
But what will we do
with so much love ?
Show it to the world
or conceal it?
We’ll do
all that is forbidden
We’ll go together
to the snack bar
We’ll smoke a pipe
in secret
We’ll stuff ourselves
on cake
But what will we do
with so much joy?
This world
is overflowing with it
We’ll do
all that is forbidden
We’ll go together
to the snack bar
We’ll smoke
a pipe in secret
We’ll stuff ourselves
on cake
But what will we do
with so much joy?
This world
is overflowing with it
We’ll have
a great many children
And our life together will be
An enchanted fairy tale
The royal physicians!
Did you consult your books?
Yes, Your Majesty, and we all agree on the diagnosis.
Tell us.
The prince is dying of love.
- Love?
- I knew it.
What do you advise?
Marriage, Your Majesty.
Is it urgent?
The sooner the better.
Thank you for your wise counsel.
We will reflect on the matter.
I refuse to handle this matter.
You must do it.
As you wish.
Wait. I’ll go with you.
My dear son!
My dear child!
- We know everything.
- You’re lucky.
You shall have her, no matter how hideous or stupid.
- Let’s not get carried away.
- You promised.
Tell us her name.
I don’t wish to distress you, but I can’t even tell you her name.
Look.
I shall marry the girl who can wear this ring.
What’s that ring?
Who gave it to you?
- No, no questions.
- But we could –
- No, I know you!
If I tell you this much, you’ll want her whole genealogy.
Then I shall command all the ladies to come –
To try the ring on.
Thank you.
"By order of the king!
All maidens are to come to the palace to try on a ring.
But remark well: maidens only!
The one whom the ring fits perfectly will marry the prince, heir to the throne.
Know ye further that said ring is very small, and the finger in question must be slender."
Come hither, ladies
This elixir of gazelle milk
will make your finger so slender
That you will wed the prince
This way, my beauties
I’ll make your finger slender
and smoother than a plum
And the prince
will fall head over heels
I have a miracle salve
To make our fingers slender
Quick, let’s open it
And rub it in well
Push harder, lazybones!
I’m afraid of hurting you
Are you stupid
or just pretending?
Tighten
until I tell you to stop!
Mother, hurry
The prince awaits
My finger’s growing thinner
Mine will fit the golden ring
My skin’s peeling off!
Mine is down to the bone !
Serves you right
You featherbrains!
The fake ! The quack!
Just look at my finger!
It looks terrible
Look at mine
It’s twice as fat as it was
- They’re so silly!
- He’s jealous
All that
just to marry a prince!
You’re just a cruel scamp
Ouch!
You’re pinching me!
- Help!
- What is it, Esther?
- I cut myself
- Serves her right
Make him go away!
Beauty has its price
Princesses first... then duchesses fallow –
I mean, follow – then marchionesses.
What a crowd!
What if it fits several of them?
No chance of that.
But what if it does?
It’s true.
I hadn’t thought of that.
Calm down! There’s no hussy –
I mean, no hurry.
And please don’t push!
I said countesses, and then behinds –
I mean, baronesses – behind them.
Sorry.
It’s well-known I have the slenderest finger in the county.
Next.
Come back in a few years.
With pleasure,
Your Highness.
Almost, but not quite.
Maids and chambermaids first, then cooks.
Kitchen hands and turkey keepers last.
Stop your crackling –
I mean, your cackling!
Miss Gauthier, servant in the castle.
Miss Nicolette, cook.
Miss Salt-and-Pepper, turkey keeper.
Miss Glumcakes, no occupation.
I doubt it’s even worth trying, sire.
Give me your hand.
No, the other one.
I told you so.
Is there no one else?
No, Your Highness.
There’s no one else,
Your Majesty.
My dear child... every lady of the realm answered your summons.
None could wear the ring.
I am very sorry.
I’m quite surprised, because this ring must belong to someone.
Come to think of it,
I don’t think I saw Donkey Skin, the girl who made me the cake.
Did no one inform the girl?
I don’t know, Your Majesty.
Send for her immediately.
Here she is, Your Majesty.
Donkey Skin!
Do you live at the third farm down the road?
Yes, Your Highness.
Show me your hand.
It’s all arranged.
I’m marrying your father.
Try to look pleased.
My daughter.
My dear daughter, here you are.
We’ll never be parted again.
The festivities
lasted almost three months.
Kings came from every land:
the king of India with his elephant,
the king of Africa with his camel,
the king of Siam with his cats,
coaches, and sedan chairs.
They say the couple’s love
would endure even now
if they hadn’t died
a hundred years later.
Our tale is perhaps
difficult to believe...
but as long as there are children
and mothers and grandmothers,
it will live on in memory.
I am Arthur Frayn, and I am Zardoz.
I have lived 300 years and I long to die, but death is no longer possible
I am immortal.
I present now my story, full of mystery and intrigue, rich in irony and most satirical.
It is set deep in a possible future, so none of these events has been occurred
But they may
Be warned, lest you end as I
In this tale I am a fake god by occupation and a magician by inclination.
Merlin is my hero
I am the puppet master
I manipulate many of the characters
But I am invented too for your entertainment and amusement
And you, poor creatures, who conjured you out of the clay?
Is God in show business too?
SET IN THE YEAR 2293
Zardoz.
Zardoz.
Praise be to Zardoz!
Praise be to Zardoz!
Praise be to Zardoz!
Zardoz speaks to you, his Chosen Ones.
We are the Chosen Ones!
You have been raised up from brutality to kill the Brutals who multiply and are legion.
To this end, Zardoz, your god, gave you the gift of the gun.
The gun is good!
The gun is good!
The penis is evil.
The penis shoots seeds and makes new life to poison the Earth with the plague of men as once it was
But the gun shoots death and purifies the Earth of the filth of Brutals.
Go forth and kill!
Zardoz has spoken.
Guns!
You foolish!
I could've shown you!
Without me, you are nothing!
A bore!
How pointless!
How pointless!

Who lives here?
I am Arthur Frayn.
- No!
- Vortex Four.
I am Arthur...
Vort... Four.
Arthur Frayn.
Vortex Four.
I am... Ar...
Vortex Four.
I am Arthur Frayn.
Vortex Four.
Three from Vortex Eight.
Four from Vortex Five.
Did you ever see such mangled limbs?
- There was some kind of rock fall in their quarry.
- There are 14 bodies for repair.
- What is it?
- Flower.
- For what?
- Decorative.
- Do you know where you are?
- In the Vortex.
You come from the Outlands.
You were told about the Vortex?
- Zardoz says...
- What does Zardoz say?
Zardoz says if you obey him, you'llgo toa Vortex when you die... and there you will live forever.
- Happily?
- Yes.
So, you think you're dead?
Am I?
- You're an Exterminator.
- I kill for Zardoz.
You came here in the stone head.
I don't know.
It is the only path and passage into the Vortex.
You will show me how you come to be here.
- You have a name?
- My name is Zed.
Zed for Zardoz.
I am an Exterminator.
The memories are simple heroics.
There are no abstractions, you will notice.
It is certainly very fragmented.
The shock of entering the Vortex could be responsible.
Zarday 312.
Twenty-five Brutals exterminated.
Took a woman in His name.
Zardoz.
The place... where the sea meets the land.
It's blacked again.
It seems to be able to control its memory.
Show us more of your work.
Zardoz made us grow wheat.
This is a more recent memory.
Cultivation has started.
- Disturbed?
- A little.
- The Outlands have to be controlled.
- I've always voted against forced farming.
You eat the bread.
We have to shut ourselves off.
We have to.
This is the first direct visual contact... with the Outlands in years as opposed to data...
...since Arthur was delegated to control them.
- It is proper that we investigate.
It's better not to know.
These images will pollute us.
Quench it. Quell it.
No Brutal has ever penetrated a Vortex.
It therefore requires study.
Perhaps it can tell us why Arthur has vanished so mysteriously.
May...
Please.
Is Arthur Frayn's memory transmission still functioning?
Arthur Frayn ceased transmission three days ago.
Replay his last memory moments.
No. Play back the preceding images so we can discover how he suffered this fall.
It is permitted only to show the accident.
No other memory image may be shown... without the consent of the individual concerned.
But we need to determine the location in case he is injured and the body has to be recovered.
Arthur Frayn died.
Reconstruction has begun.
Ah, yes. There.
That'san end to it.
- Kill it, May.
- No.
May, for our love.
- Consuella...
- Don't.
I will invoke a community vote.
- The community will follow my intuition.
- Then I will go to the Vortex.
- You're hurting me.
- Consuella, this is an experiment!
We must find out how it came here!
Where is Arthur Frayn?
How did you come into the stone?
Zardoz... The stone.
Terribly exciting.
- What of the suffering?
- Oh, you can't equate. Their feelings with ours.
It's just entertainment.
Again, this is a key image.
My father was Chosen.
My mother was Chosen.
Only we could breed.
Only the Chosen.
Selective breeding, do you think?
What has Arthur been doing out there all these years?
Never discuss this in the Vortex.
You'll have to be thoroughly investigated.
No one else wanted to run the Outlands.
He's an artist!
He does it with imagination.
I love to see them running.
I love the moment of their death when I am one with Zardoz
Obscenely decaying flesh.
The sweet scent of put refaction already in the air.
He's a fine, strong beast.
Dear May,
- What exactly do you want to do with him?
- A full genetic study. Break its DNA code.
See if there are any structural or evolutional changes since ours were analyzed 200 years ago.
Discover any new hereditary disease factors that may have emerged... which might result in broadening our immunization spectrum.
Study its emotional and psychic elements in relation to its sociology.
That all sounds respectably scientific, but what is May's under-thought?
Not long ago she was asking for new births, although we have no death.
We are perfectly stabilized.
We said no to May.
Now she wants to bring in this animal from the outside.
Think about equilibrium.
Remember the delicate balance we must maintain.
The presence will dismay our tranquility.
May is a great scientist, but she also has destructive tendencies.
- We have adequate means of controlling it.
- Surely, we are not so vulnerable!
Look at it.
It knows its life is at stake.
Otherwise, it would rape and kill, as it always has.
- I don't agree.
- No, no!
- You can see the disrupting effect.
- Let's keep it.
- Yes!
- Anything to relieve the boredom.
- I want to see more of its memories.
- So do I!
This is a psychic disturbance.
Avalow, what does it portend for the future?
How did we conjure up a monster in our midst, and why?
That is the question we must answer.
Well, you've set their fur flying, my friend.
I wonder what's going on inside your pea brain, hmm?
I like you, you sly old monster.
Do you hear?
- Yes, vote. Vote.
- Let's vote.
Pro.
Against.
Verdict.
Congratulations.
You live... for three weeks.
Zed.
I'll examine him later in the dome.
Morning, monster.
Time for work.
All right, let's stop all the nonsense, shall we? Where's Arthur Frayn?
Ever hear the expression 'lf looks could kill? ' Well, here they can.
There's no need to pretend innocence with me.
I'm in Arthur Frayn's confiidence.
I know more than you think.
You're saying nothing.
All right, we'll wait and see.
Don't be sullen.
I'm going to look after you.
Whenever you're ready to, just ask me questions.
Anything at all.
This is where you'll be working for me each morning.
Just menial tasks, nothing too taxing.
- Is this your god's house?
- Ah, it's God you're seeking, is it?
Well, here we are.
Gods, goddesses, kings and queens.
Take your pick.
- But they're all dead.
- Dead?
Died of boredom.
That's wrong.
It's wrong!
It is cataloged according to your instructions.
I told you to analyze design growth across all makes of car, not just a chronological list from one manufacturer!
A much more complex program.
Shall I seek Vortex consent for a longer program?
- Shall I seek Vortex consent...
- Yes!
- It will take time.
There is a stack-up on some circuits.
Well, I've got time, and plenty of it.
Three weeks.
Define three weeks.
Twenty-one days.
Five hundred and four hours.
Thirty thousand, two-hundred and forty minutes.
One million, eight-hundred... and fourteen thousand...
Do you believe, he's never seen a clock before?
Obviously not!
- Are you not taking food with us, May?
- No.
Come, Zed, this way.
- She's taking her studies very seriously.
- She only has three weeks.
- Doy ou know yethow the Brutal came here?
- No conclusion.
Insuffiicient data received.
Go in.
Go on.
- Look into the ring.
- No retina abnormalities.
Fundus normal.
Disc and retinal vessels normal.
No hemorrhages or exudates.
Macula area clear.
Attention... Continuation of the trial of George Saden of Vortex Four.
George Saden, accused of transmitting a negative aura in Second Level.
This is not so.
I have studied our social, emotional substructures for 140 years.
These thoughts are constructive criticisms, pyramidical.
I am innocent of psychic violence.
As you examine my face and eyes, you will see that this is true.
He's lying.
Vortex Three.
You looking for the head, monster?
It's gone. Off on its endless journey from Vortex to Vortex, round and round like me and the bread, forever and ever.
- Will he be punished for that?
- Of course.
But you have no police, no Exterminators.
Ah, but we discuss it endlessly!
Every little sin and misdemeanor raked over and over.
- So, what happens to him then?
- He'll get six months at least.
- Prison?
- Aging.
- Aging?
- Yes! I'm getting old myself.
Three months here, a year there.
These sentences add up.
So, if you're bad often enough, you'll die.
They make you old, but they don't let you die.
- So, what's to stop you killing yourself?
- I do now and again, but the eternal
Tabernacle simply rebuilds me.
- Would you like to see immortality at work?
- Yes!
Well, get a move on then!
This is where they live, the Renegades.
They're condemned to an eternity of senility.
We provide them with food, but they are shunned.
They're malicious and vicious, so in and out fast. l, myself, feel quite that moving.
- Hey!
- Look, I like it! I like it! i Like...
Loamer.
Gray.
I loved this girl once, monster.
You idle Apathetic!
Melancholy sight.
Grayler.
Bones.
Whoa there, boy. Whoa up.
You are asked to vote at the termination of the trial of George Saden.
Final statement from the accused begins.
I confess to the charges, but plead mitigation.
I tried to suppress these thoughts, but they leak out in Second Level. through the head wound of my third death.
I was imperfectly repaired.
No. That is not true.
- I think what I think.
- That's more like it.
I'm with you, George.
I hate you all.
I hate you all.
I hate you all. especially me.
Vote, please. Vote, please.
I'm voting for him, monster.
It won't do any good. Nothing ever does.
Absolute acquittal.
Go on, monster, help your self.
Didn't Zardoz tell you about the Apathetics?
It's a disease.
And it's slowly creeping through all the Vortexes.
That's why Zardoz made you grow crops... to feed these people.
We can't support them anymore.
Apathetic or Renegade, make your choice.
Yes. A bit frightening, isn't it?
Very good.
Now you're beginning to show yourself.
Final votes.
For, 9;
Against, 586; undecided, 86.
Sentence. George Saden will be aged five years.
Welcome to paradise.
Penile erection was one of the many unsolved evolutionary mysteries surrounding sexuality.
Every society had an elaborate subculture devoted to erotic stimulation.
But nobody could quite determine how this becomes this.
Of course, we all know the physical process involved, but not the link between stimulus and response.
There seems to be a correlation with violence, with fear.
Many hanged men died with an erection.
You are all more or less aware of our intensive researches into this subject.
Sexuality declined probably because we no longer needed to procreate.
Eternals soon discovered that erection was impossible to achieve.
And we are no longer victims of this violent, convulsive act... which so debased women and betrayed men.
This Brutal, like other primates living unselfconscious lives, is capable of spontaneous and reflexive erection.
As part of May's studies of this creature, we're trying to find, once again, the link between erotic stimulation and erection.
This experiment will measure autoerotic stimulation of the cortex, leading to erection.
Play.
The tracer indicates that this image is not erotically stimulating to the Brutal.
Change.
This doesn't seem to affect him either.
Consuella's done the trick herself.
The Brutal is now in fourth hour of unconscious sleep.
It's astonishing that Homo sapiens spend so much time in this vulnerable condition, at the mercy of its enemies.
Is there any data on the sleeping patterns of primitive people?
- Is that a priority request?
- Yes.
I'm now going to test its waking response to danger stimuli.
Does it please you to sleep?
Yes.
Why?
I have dreams.
Sleep was necessary fo rman... when his waking and unconscious lives were separated.
As Eternals achieved total consciousness, sleep became obsolete and Second Level meditation took its place.
Sleep was closely connected with death.
Look at it. It's you.
Your genetic structure.
Your life chart.
Look!
You are a Mutant.
Second, maybe third generation.
Therefore, genetically stable.
Enlarged brain.
Total recall.
Your potential is...
- Your breeding potential...
- Breeding?
Frayn. How did you get into the Vortex?
What is your purpose?
I'm just an Exterminator. I know nothing
You must know that you're mentally and physically vastly superior to me or anyone else here.
You could be anything.
Could do... anything.
- You must be destroyed.
- Why?
- Because you could destroy us.
- As you've destroyed the rest of life?
Can you un-know what you know now about me?
For the sake of science, I will keep this knowledge from the others for the moment.
Keep you alive.
But you must follow me, obey me, be circumspect, make no disruption, quietly do whatever work is given you.
I will watch over you.
Get a move on, you silly beast.
Friend, put that thing outside!
Anyone else disturbed?
Then let's take yet another boringly democratic vote, shall we, Consuella?
It's Friend's day to make the food.
He must do this without help as we all do.
It's fundamental to our society that we do everything for ourselves on a basis of absolute equality.
- And Friend knows that perfectly well.
- Yes or no?
Potatoes, yes or no?
I say get more Zeds to do the work.
We have eternal life, and yet we sentence ourselves to all this drudgery.
I tell you, I'm sick of 200 years of washing up.
And I'm sick of pitting my bare hands against the blind brute stupidity of nature!
- You'd better do something about this.
- Consuella is right.
Zed is being kept here for scientific study.
It can earn its keep on the land, but it should not do the work of a servant.
Time enough has gone to finish your study, May. Destroy it!
No! No. No.
See how it disrupts our community?
- It is almost over.
- How can you speak such in front of Zed?
It feels. I sense that.
- Vote!
- Yes, vote!
Give your votes.
May has been given seven days to complete her study.
Then Zed will be terminated.
The monster is a mirror.
And when we look at him, we look into our own hidden faces.
Meditate on this at Second Level.
No.
No.
I will... I will not go to Second Level.
No.
I will not go to Second Level.
I will... No!
I will not be one mind with you!
I know what...
I know what May wants with Zed.
No!
No.
The Vortex is an obscenity!
I know...
I know that I hate all women.
Birth. Fertility.
Superstition.
Friend is beyond redemption.
- Renegade.
- Renegade.
Friend, he's a Renegade.
He must be cast out.
He is no longer one with us.
Renegade. Cast him out!
No!
Renegade! Renegade!
Caution. You are approaching the periphery shield of Vortex Four.
Caution. You are approaching the periphery shield of Vortex Four.
Have you seen Friend?
Friend. I seek Friend.
Friend.
I seek Friend.
Friend.
Old Friend.
This is your fault.
Now hear this, you old farts!
Meet this creature from the outside world.
- Huh? What?
- This man has the gift of death.
- Death?
- He can mete it out, and he can die himself!
He's mortal.
- He can die!
- Die!
- Shall we give him back to death?
- Yes!
- Silent death?
- Yes!
- Glorious death?
- Yes!
May, the scientist, wants him to spawn another generation to suffer our agonies!
Come on back to death!
Stop! Stop!
What is it you want?
Sweet death. Oblivion.
For yourself, or for the whole Vortex?
For everybody.
An end to the human race.
It has plagued this pretty planet for far too long.
You stink of despair.
Fight back!
Fight for death, if that's what you want
I thought at first you were the one to help.
But it's hopeless.
All my powers have gone.
Where is it, the Tabernacle?
The Tabernacle is...
- I can't remember.
- Who made it?
Someone must know how to break it.
Yes.
You can meet him for yourself.
One of our founders. One of the geniuses that discovered immortality.
But he found he didn't like it for himself.
He didn't conform. So this is what his grateful people did to him.
- We want to die!
- Hmm?
- What's the trick?
- Death.
Death.
Talk to May.
May?
May, I want your help.
You want to destroy us. The Tabernacle
I want the truth.
You must give the truth... if you wish to receive it.
I'm ready.
- It'll burn you.
- Then burn me.
Tell me... everything.
Show me pictures.
Open your mind.
Your memory... go back to the beginning.
- Open.
- Zar...
- Open.
- Zar...
- Open!
- Zardoz!
Zardoz gave us the gun.
We were the Chosen Ones.
What was your task?
To kill the Brutals, who multiply and are legion.
We rode out. We roamed the Outlands.
We killed. It was enough.
Man was born to hunt and kill.
- And then?
- Then, one day...
- Yes?
- Something happened.
It changed everything.
I... lost my innocence.
A face in the window.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
He wore a mask.
He led me on like a game.
Why did you spare him?
Something... Uh, I don't know.
- Had you seen a book before?
- Never.
- You learned to read.
- Yes.
- How long did it take?
- It came easy.
I read everything.
I learned all that had been hidden from me.
I learned what the world had been before the darkness fell.
Then, one day, I found the book.
The book called...
Uh, called...
What was the book?
What was the name of the book?
- I don't remember!
- Tell me.
- Show me. You must tell me!
- No! No!
Zardoz.
Tell me. Show me. You must tell me.
I can't! You saw him carved in stone.
Can't remember!
Yes you can!
- You knew that Arthur was Zardoz.
- No!
- You killed Arthur, didn't you?
- No!
Show me. What are you doing?
You murdered your own god by accident.
Or was it an accident?
Now, show me that book.
What did you find in that book?
Show it to me.
It's a trick! A trick!
What was a trick? Tell me!
Zardoz said, 'Stop. '
Said, 'No more. '
- No more what?
- No more killing.
- He told you to take prisoners?
- Yes.
- To make slaves?
- Yes.
- To cultivate instead of kill?
- Yes!
- To grow wheat?
- Yes!
- Did you need wheat?
- No. We ate meat.
Zardoz betrayed us.
We were hunters, not farmers.
Show how you came into the stone.
Show.
It was easy.
Each season, Zardoz came down to take our harvest.
Zardoz.
- Your friends were Mutants too.
- Yes.
- You had a plot.
- Yes.
- Revenge?
- The truth.
We wanted the truth!
- I told them about the book.
- Show it. What is 'the book'?
No. No.
No! Zardoz.
Zardoz is pleased.
- So that was it.
- The Wizard of Oz.
Zardoz.
The Wizard of Oz was a fairy story, about an old man who frightened people with a loud voice and a big mask.
It was Arthur Frayn's idea.
A simple way of controlling the Outlands.
But remember the end of the story.
They looked behind the mask and found the truth.
I looked behind the mask, and I saw the truth. - Zardoz.
So, that was your plan... to stow away in the head.
Yes.
What was your purpose? To kill Arthur?
To penetrate the Vortex? To find a way in for your friends to destroy us?
- He made us killers.
- Revenge! You wanted revenge.
The truth!
The truth.
Truth or revenge?
Revenge!
Revenge.
Mm. I remember feelings such as those.
They stir in me.
So this is your scientific investigation.
There's another word for it. Bestiality.
For this, you will be aged 50 years, no less.
No man, woman or beast will ever desire you again.
He can't see.
He's blind.
We can no longer quell him.
He's out of control.
We must now become hunters and killers ourselves.
Come.
This will restore your sight, and you will see more and deeper than you ever saw before.
I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch.
I see now why you are here.
You are the One, the Liberator.
Death.
I will help you... if, when the time comes, you will set me free.
You have great strength, but there are times when that strength will fail you.
Eat this when the need arises.
This place is built on lies and suffering.
How could you do what you did to us?
The world was dying..
We took all that was good and made an oasis here.
We few, the rich, the powerful, the clever, cut ourselves off to guard the knowledge and treasures of civilization as the world plunged into a Dark Age.
To do this, we had to harden our hearts against the suffering outside.
We are custodians of the past for an unknown future.
You are the price we now pay for that isolation.
You have brought hate and anger into the Vortex... to infect us all.
Get him! Get him!
Kill him!
- It's indestructible.
- No! No! It can't be done!
No!
Caution. You are approaching the periphery shield...
Ride round. Fast!
He's somewhere in these buildings.
Smoke him out. Cover the exits.
Over there.
We've got him trapped.
There's no one in here.
We... take life from you.
Life flows out of you. Flows into us.
Get him! Get him!
Come on!
Search the undergrowth!
Come on! Look over here!
He's no...
He's not here.
It's getting dark.
- It's him. It's him!
- None of them could catch him!
But he falls into the hands of the poor old Renegades.
Death.
Bring... Bring death to you all.
Find Friend... Take me to Friend.
- What'd he say?
- Shut up.
It's a miracle! We're Apathetics.
Tell us how, please.
We want some too.
We started chasing the Brutal.
We got excited.
We saw someone.
We thought it was him.
It wasn't, but we killed him anyway.
And then we felt desire.
Look at the excitement you've caused.
You naughty girl.
Your task is to secure allarms, weapons and food supplies.
Work house to house, east to west down the valley.
If you find the Brutal, destroy immediately.
He's trapped. It's only a matter of time.
Friend. Friend!
Kiss the bride, dear Friend.
Kiss the bride!
You did well. I will take the bride.
Death comes closer for us all.
Find May. Tell her that Friend needs her.
Friend, I cannot sanction this violence and destruction.
It's too late, May.
There's no going back.
Don't destroy the Vortex!
Let us renew it. A better breed could prosper here. Given time...
Time?
Wasn't eternity enough?
This place is against life..
It must die.
I have my followers.
Inseminate us all, and we'll teach you all we know.
Give you all we have.
Perhaps you can break the Tabernacle.
Or be broken.
An end to eternity.
A higher form.
Revenge.
Charge!
- How much time do we have?
- We will not work in time.
You will take our knowledge... by osmosis... out of time.
We will touch teach you, and you will give us your seed.
...where it is assumed that E-75 equals R-and M-75.
Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things.
...physical and geometrical assumptions.
And the two things...
In any given phenomenon or thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary...

...could have results in many different ways... by making compensative changes...

...could twist the sinews of thy heart.
And when thy heart began to beat, oh, what dread hand and what dread feet.
* The invisible worm*.
* That flies in the night *l
* Has found out thy bed of secret dreams *
Through me you pass into the city of woe.
Through me you pass into eternal sorrow.
Through me you pass among the forgotten people.
Marxist philosophy held that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe.
This law operates universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking.
The central nervous system no longer occurs as a self-contained organism,
Now, you know all that we know.
It's a prison. A prison.
No, it's an ark. A ship.
A space ship.
All this technology was for travel to the distant stars.
- Did you go?
- Yes.
Another dead end.
How did it come about?
The Vortex. How did it start?
They did it. They were the scientists, the best in the world.
But they were middle-aged, too conditioned to mortality.
They went Renegade. We were their off spring, and we were born into Vortex life.
We seal ourselves... here with... into this place of learning.
Death is banished forever.
I direct that the Tabernacle erase from us all memories of its construction, so we can never destroy it if we should ever crave for death.
Here, man and the sum of his knowledge will never die, but go forward to perfection.
We applied ourselves to the unsolved mysteries of the universe, but even with infinite time and the help of the Tabernacle, our minds were not up to it.
We failed.
Two. Four continuations of the same, two anomalous.
...is to be changeless, and matter...
And now we're trapped by our own devices
There is no exit.
Violence has the tendency to accelerate.
However, the concept of total
Destroy it! The Tabernacle!
Kill the Tabernacle.
The Tabernacle is indestructible and everlasting.
This crystal shall join us each to each, and all to the Tabernacle.
A crystal joins them. A crystal.
Now we have given you all that we are, one gift remains, which contains everything... and nothing.
Look into this.
You will see lines running into the future.
You will make insight jumps.
When you can see into this crystal, then you will be ready. Only then.
I see nothing inside, except my own perplexity.
Knowledge is not enough.
I have come for you.
Overhere.
- We've met before, I believe.
- Arthur Frayn.
Come now.
My Brutal friends call me Zardoz.
Revenge!
Now, we're even.
'Would it have been worth while...
'to have squeezed the universe into a ball...
'to roll it towards some overwhelming question?
To say, 'I am Lazarus, come from the dead? '
Do you know the next line?
It's T.S. Eliot.
'I am Lazarus, come from the dead.
Come back to tell you all.
I shall tell you all. '
Well done, well done.
You've learned your lessons well.
What will you tell me?
What do you see in the ball?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Then I have nothing to tell you.
That way! There!
What do you see in the ball?
Consuella.
I've ached for this moment.
You cannot. You will not.
The hunt is always better than the kill.
In hunting you, I have become you.
I have destroyed what
I set out to defend.
'He that fights too long against dragons... becomes a dragon himself. ' Nietzsche.
I am not like the others.
I would fill you with life... and love.
You have given me what no other gave. Love.
If I live, we will live together.
Go now.
The Brutal is not here. I was mistaken.
Refraction of light. Infinite.
Break the Tabernacle. Or be broken.
What do you see in the crystal ball?
When you see into the crystal, then you will be ready.
Now I see it. I am ready.
Tabernacle? What are you?
Not permitted.
- Where are you?
- Not permitted.
Do you know me?
I have your voice print, Zed, and your genetic code.
But only memory fragments.
Tell me about the crystal transmitter.
I cannot give information which may threaten my own security.
Brain emissions refract low-wavelength laser light, passing through the crystal in the brain.
They are a code sent to you for interpretation and storage.
- Yes or no?
- Not permitted.
A receiver must be like a transmitter.
I think you're a crystal.
In fact, this one. This diamond.
In here, there is infinite storage space for refracted light patterns.
Yes or no?
You have me in the palm of your hand.
But you could be elsewhere.
Yet I choose to be here.
- Why?
- To confront you.
Already you have learned to see my light wavelengths in the diamond.
Now, you will try to erase the refractions and destroy me.
Your aim is to destroy me, isn't it?
Yes.
Would you kill God?
Such vanity.
I am the sum of all these people and all their knowledge
I am all-seeing.
I am everywhere and nowhere.
That has often served as a definition of God.
Would you destroy us and all that we are?
Yes.
Would you not rather be part of us, joined to us, a light shining to the future?
Love us! Cherish the truth!
No!
You have penetrated me.
There is no escape.
You are within me.
Come to my center.
Come into the center of the crystal.
Tabernacle!
Tabernacle!
Tabernacle!
Tabernacle!
No!
No!
No!
You have destroyed us.
You found the flaw in the crystal.
We are gone.
You are alone.
Take him to the east door.
Oh, it's too late. He's finished.
Consuella, no.
Stay close to me, inside my aura.
Where did they go? Where?
They went up there.
Can you tell us how things stand?
Wh-What next?
An old man calls me.
'The voice of the turtle is heard in the land. '
I...
I remember now.
The way it was.
We challenged the natural order.
The Vortex is... an offense against nature.
She had to find a way to destroy us.
Battle of wills.
So... she made you!
We... We forced the hand of evolution.
A good death.
You've done it!
He's dead!
- Look!
- The stone head!
Take this, and let your sons and daughters look into it.
Ride east. There, you will pass through the wall.
What will become of you?
Will you go back to your people?
There is no going back for me.
Put 'em out of there! Get out!
Stop! It's useless. It's over.
- The Renegades are all dying like flies!
- Dying?
- It's not Zed to blame. We destroyed ourselves.
- That's truer than you know, Consuella.
And here I would like to claim some credit.
You see, our death wish was devious and deep.
As Zardoz, Zed, I was able to choose your forefathers.
It was careful genetic breeding that produced this Mutant.
This slave who could free his masters.
And Friend was my accomplice!
Don't you remember the man in the library, Zed?
It was I who led you to The Wizard of Oz book.
It was I who gave you access to the stone. It was I!
I bred you. I led you.
And I have looked into the face of the force that put the idea in your mind.
You are bred and led yourself.
Arthur! We've all been used.
- And reused.
- And abused!
And amused!
Death approaches.
We are all mortal again.
Now we can say yes to death, but never again no.
Now, we must make our farewells. to each other, to the sun and moon, trees and sky, earth and rock.
The landscape of our long, waking dream.
Zed... the Liberator, liberate me now... according to your promise.
Do it. Do it!
All that I was is gone.
Kill me too!
- Let's kill each other, Friend.
- Huh? What?
- Proper regard for irony.
- Yes, yes.
One last trick?
Success.
It was all a joke.
I want to die.
Please!
Kill me, I... I want to die!
Please!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!

How dare you?
I mean, how dare you lie and try to embarrass me in front of my students.
- I wasn't lying.
- Thaùs a lie on top of a lie.
Ugh! You're not one of my pupils.
What school are you playing hooky from?

Thaùs just what this town needs.

You disgusting little street urchin!
You could be locked up for this.
Where's the sheriff?
Please. I didn't do anything.
Your skirt got caught on a nail.
Yes!
Your fingernail!
Gentlemen,
I propose to say...
Passamaquoddy's a beautiful community... where the sun always rises and the sun always sets.
- Thaùs very deep. Don't you think?
- Elliott!
Iùs a place of serenity and security, where the unexpected never happens.
- Ow!
- [Elliott Grumbles, Growls]
- Iùs okay, Elliott.
- [Astonished Mumbling]
It seems to say,
"Welcome!"
You-You absolute oaf.
You-You idiot!
- No, come, come.
- Look, it was that kid that pushed me.
He pulled off
Miss Taylor's petticoat.
- He walked through my cement with his big feet.
- He scared my horse, Victoria.

Oh! Gentlemen...
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# A green and seething fire-breathing monster is in sight #
# With eyes of red a lion's head and wings as dark as night #
# Oh, he has a jaw of gleaming teeth
He's 50 feet in height #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
# Iùs true, iùs true
He'll break us all in two #
# Oh, he's comin' in
His great big fin is right against the door #
# So board up all the windows #
# And get down on the floor #
Has anybody seen my dad?
Nora, please, my child, come in.
- Get off that street.
- Whaùs the matter?
- Worst thing I ever saw in my life out on the street.
- What was it?
- I don't want to tell you for fear iùll scare you to death!
- Scare me.
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon #
# His tail lashing, he'll be smashing every shop in town #
# With scaly feet he'll crack the street and tear the steeple down #
# Iùs not some loony dream
I heard a scream from Sheriff Brown #
# Iùs true, iùs true
Oh, what are we to do #
- # Iùs true, iùs true #
- # Old Lampie's in a stew #
# A dragon, a dragon
I swear there was a dragon #
# You're off your hinges
All those binges put you in a haze #
# You crazy fools
Iùs all your doggone fault he's in a daze #
# Let go of me, let go of me and mend your wicked ways #

- Now, why don't you just calm down?
- I seen his face.
If you wanna call it a face.
It was this close to me.
Why don't you lie down, Dad? Come on.
You know what else?
It started to smile at me.
- Well, did you smile back?
- I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.
And you know...
And you know what else?
There was this boy with it.
And he wasn't afraid.
- This boy...
- Lie down.

We're in a lot of trouble, and iùs all your fault.
[Sighing]
[Inhaling]
[Exhaling]
[Inhaling, Exhaling]
I don't wanna play.
You did everything wrong is Passamaquoddy.
Now everybody hates us.
I don't know whether you're good for me... or bad.
[Sniffles]
I'm sorry, Elliott.
I didn't really mean that.
Iùs just
I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.
[Sniffles]
[Groans]
Hello in there!
[Whispering]
Get back!
[Grumbling, Grunting]
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just playing tic-tac-toe.
[Chuckling] Well, this isn't exactly the best place for tic-tac-toe.
The tide's coming in.
High water reaches this cave sometimes.
You better head for home.
You're not from
Passamaquoddy, are you?
Nope.
Just sort of... travelling.
Where are your parents?
Where are you staying?
- Whaùs your name?
- Pete.
I'm Nora, and I have to get back on watch, up in the lighthouse.
There's chowder on the stove, if you'd like some.
Wh-Whaùs the matter?
Iùs a hand, not a shark.
You can finish that chowder... if you'd like.
[Exhales, Sniffles]
Oh, I forgot something.
Be right back.
I forgive you, Elliott.
- [Giggles]
- [Sighs, Chuckles]
Stay here till I see what iùs like up in the lighthouse.
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
The Gogans own me,
I guess.
They said it was against the law for me to ever leave them.
Where did you get that bruise?
Mr Gogan. I was milking the cow, and I missed the bucket.
- Had he done that before?
- All the time.
The first time I ran away, the orphan home sent me back.
This time,
I'll just keep running.
Well, you'll be safe here.
Nora, no one's ever been this nice to me. I'll always remember it.
Pete, why don't you sleep here tonight?
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow.
Okay?
Wonderful.
I've got work to do. Come on.
Are you anybody's mother?
I'm not even anybody's wife.
But you're gonna get married now, aren't you?
[Scoffs] I'm already married to this lighthouse.
- Who's that?
- Paul.
- Is he part of your family?
- He almost was.
- How can someone almost be part of a family?
- We were going to be married.
How come you weren't?
Well, as far as we know, his ship was headed for a storm.
They were never heard from again.
That was a year ago.
He'll come back.
I tell myself the same thing every day, standing up there watching for ships on the horizon.
[Sighs] Time I should be thinking of other things, so they tell me.
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.
He has a way of knowing things.
Who's Elliott?
- My dragon.
- Dragon?
[Gasps]
So you're the boy with the dragon.
- Yup.
- Where is he?
- Down in the cave.
- Thaùs interesting.
I've never known anyone with a dragon.
What does he look like?
Just a plain, ordinary dragon.
How plain?
How ordinary?
# He has the head of a camel #
# The neck of a crocodile #
It sounds rather strange.
# He's both a fish and a mammal #
# And I hope he'll never change #
# 'Cause iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# I'm glad I found him
I love him #
# I won't let him get away #
# 'Cause iùs not easy #
# You say the head of a camel #
- # The neck of a crocodile #
- And the ears of a cow!
# Iùs clear that friends can be different #
# Yes, I understand you now #
[Together] # Iùs not easy to find someone who cares #
# Iùs not easy to find magic in pairs #
# Now that you have him
Hold him #
# Treasure him from day to day #
# Iùs so easy #
# Life is lollipops and raindrops #
# With the one you love #
# Someone you can always be with #
# Argue and agree with #
# Climb the highest tree with #
[Together]
# Iùs not easy #
# To share somebody's dream #
# It gets easy when you work as a team #
# You've got to tend it
Fan it #
# Thaùs what
I plan to do #
# Oh, I had one friend by my side #
# Now I have two #
# Him and you #
# Him and me #
[Together]
# And iùs so easy #

- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, son.
- Nice to see you again.
- Ah. Thank you.
Aah!
- Iùs you!
- Whaùs the matter?
Iùs you.
The boy with the dragon.
Yes, sir.
[Screaming]
Dad! Dad, what is it?
- The boy with the dragon.
- I know, I know. Now, just take it easy.
You saw it.
You saw it?
I didn't actually see it, but I know what it looks like.
- But wha...
- We'll talk about it later.
O-One thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?
- No, Ellioùs down in the cave.
- Oh, Ellio...
Elliott? Lt... It even has a name.
There's nothing to get upset about.
You're right. Right, there's nothing to get upset about.
Nothing. No, why should I get upset?
I should be happy.
L... I should be happy! I'll go down to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.
I'll say, "Boys, here it is."
And then hear the apologies. [Laughs]
Ellioùll be happy to do it for you, sir.
Good boy. Good lad.
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.
Oh. Elliott...
He won't... won't start to scratch or... or fight, or set anything on fire, will he?
- Well, he's sort of...
- Sort of what?
- Unpredictable.
- Now, don't do anything with Elliott.
Wh-Why don't you leave him where he is?
- Iùs too dangerous to take him into town.
- Iùs dangerous.
Now, I don't want either one of you to say a word about Elliott...
- to anyone, do you understand,
- No. No. Yes!
Until we've talked this over.
Now, leùs all have breakfast. The lamp has to be polished, the lens cleaned, and I want to take Pete to buy new clothes.
Yes, well, clean Elliott and eat the lamp.
I mean, we'll... clea-clean the lamp.
[Muttering] Elliott!
The name's Elliott. Did you hear that?
Doc Terminus is comin'!
Are they still after us?
We lost 'em.
Good.
- Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
- What?
Pass-a-ma-quoddy ahead, ahoy!
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
All hands on deck!
Here comes the Doc!
[Dog Barking]
- [Screams] Slow down!
- My fence!
Wet! Wet!
Iùs still wet!
[Screaming]
Throw out the anchor!
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.
[Screams]
[Townspeople Screaming]
When did I start losing control of my town?
[Both Screaming]
- You dummy!
- You told me to drop the anchor.
I dropped the anchor.
[Groaning]
- Watch Bones.
- Get him off of me! Get him off!
I think they remember us.
Uh-oh. I think
I remember them.
- Just act normal.
- I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.
Quick, whaùs the name of this town again?
Passamaquoddy.
- "Quassama" what?
- Passamaquoddy!
Got it. How wonderful to see your smiling faces again.
All of you.
I-I've never known such warmth, such welcome, such loving hospitality.
Get out, ya quack!
And don't bring those phoney remedies here again.
Go on back where you belong: Jail.
- [Booing]
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I sense enthusiasm,
I sense loving response, and thaùs why I feel that this is my home... away from home.

Oh, Doctor! Oh, Doctor!

Someone in need.

Pete, if you bring up the oil can, we'll be ready for the night.
Sure. Before that, I'd like to show Elliott my new suit.
No! No, no.
You can't bring Elliott up here.
Government regulation 302 states that... no dragons shall be allowed... on the premises of the United States' lighthouses.
Now, go on down and get the oil so I can mark it up in the log that you did that.
Okay. Nora, first can
I bring Paul's picture down to Elliott?
Then he can start looking for Paul.
All right.
[Door Opens,
Closes]
- Thanks, Dad.
- For what?
- For making believe about the dragon and going along with it.
- Making...
It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.
I'm not making believe.
I actually saw it.
And I haven't been the same since!
Go to the cave; you'd see it too, and your eyes would...
- [Popping] pop right out!
- [Scoffs]
I was there.
I saw nothing!
Dad, be realistic.
Oh, you wanna be realistic.
Leùs talk about how realistic you are.
Here you are, waiting for someone to come back that just ain't gonna come back, Nora.
And if waitin' for over a year hasn't told ya nothin', then you're not the one to talk about being realistic, are you?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I'm going down to the hardware store.

Hi, Elliott!
How do you like my new suit?
Wow!
[Panting]
[Gibberish]
And new shoes too.
Look at the way they shine!
[Laughing]
Nora's so nice to me,
I want us to do something for her.
I want you to concentrate on finding Paul for Nora.
This is what he looks like.
[Gibberish]
Remember his face.
Try real hard.
Hmm.
[Gibberish]
Better go now.
- [Kissing]
- Aww.
- See ya tomorrow.
- [Whistling]
[Giggling]
Twelve times a day till iùs empty, then come back.
One dollar, please.
Thank you.
I'm getting tired.
Sick and tired... of having to explain why we have a sail instead of horses.
Would you rather tell them how I gave the horses away in Matawanakey... to settle a malpractice suit, hmm?
- No.
- Well, don't worry.
When we leave here, we'll have horses again and plenty more.
- More what?
- More everything.
- Whoo!
- More anything! I don't know.
Do you mind if I sound optimistic?
This is the worst town on our route.
I hate Pass... Pass...
- Pastafazooli, or whatever the name is.
- Quoddy.
Yeah! I don't wanna cure anybody here.
- They all deserve to have whatever they have.
- I'll drink to that.
I've had nothing, nothing but bad luck in this burg.
Hey! Ooh...
- I'm sorry, Doc.
- You see what I mean, hmm?
Doc, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, Hoagy.
- I di... Can I buy everybody a round?
- Yeah.
Huh? Well... Hey, 'cause,
Doc, I gotta talk to you. Okay?
- Sit down.
- May I? Thank you.
Hey, you're a ma...
You're a man of science, ain't you?
A man of science, yes.
Yes, I am.
With degrees from the Royal Medical College, London.
- Huh?
- The Gleinen Einen Peitzen in Vienna.
- Oh!
- And the Moulin Rouge in Paris.
Why do you think they call me Doc?
Because they sail their boats into me, hmm?
Eh?
[Chuckling]
Oh. You know anything about dragons?
Of course I do. I see them in all the big cities going down the streets, with that funny little walk, wearing bright colours, fluttering around...
No, no, no. I'm talkin' about a real dragon.
Real dragon. With fire... fire coming out of his mouth.
And he's got real wings.
Uh, you need a veterinarian. Hmm?
- Why do you ask?
- I saw one.
Is it sitting at the next table?
Hmm? [Chuckling]
I tell ya, I saw a real dragon yesterday afternoon.
He's owned... owned by a young boy... by the name of Pete.
You are trying to tell me that there is a dragon here...
- In Passamacracka? Yeah.
- "Quoddy."
- Yes.
- I told you this was a rotten town.
Well, in my educated opinion, sir,
- I think you've been up in your lighthouse too long.
- Huh?
Wait. Wait, listen. What if what
I just told you was true?
In my scientific opinion, the existence of a dragon... would have an impact of gigantic proportions.
Mythology and legend would become history and science.
- One could really make a quick buck with it.
- Well, I can prove it.
I can prove it!
H-His name is Elliott.
[Stammering] H-He's downstairs.
You could go and see him right now.
Unfortunately,
I cannot make it right now.
I have an appointment with a young lady who's interested in a nursing career.
- Oh. Oh.
- I wanna see it.
- You wanna see it?
Well, see it you shall!
- Okay.
But first...
First, leùs have a quick one... because of the rocks we have to climb.
And the dragon...
The dragon is scary.
Okay, we'll have one for the rocks.
And one for the scary.
- Quoddy.
- Hmm?
Shh!
Nora. Shh!
We don't...
We don't...
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
- Huh?
- Shh.
- We don't want Nora to hear us.
- Shh.
I tell you that he's in there.
[Deep Sighing]
[Lips Smacking]
- Are you convinced?
- Absolutely.
- Well, leùs get outta here.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a mi...
I-I want to pet him.
Huh? You wa...
You want to pet him?
Are you crazy?
I know you ain't drunk.
No matter what you see in here, don't get scared.
[Footsteps]
Hey, I might as well tell you straight off, you're gonna see a hideous monster.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
And iùs big.
Fifty feet of terror!
Claws! Claws so sharp they could tear a man to shreds.
- [Gulps]
- Eyes, evil eyes... that can see right through ya.
And a tail thaùs so big and powerful, it could destroy the hull of a frigate!
It can wipe out an entire crew... with one swish of his tail.
Face... Face so terrible, it could turn a man to stone, a hero into a coward.
A flame so hot, it could roast a turkey!
And a mouth so terrible, it could devour a man and...
[Spits] spit him 20 leagues.
Stay close.
[Sputtering]
Iùs g-g-g-got m-me.
[Screams]
[Stammering]
Look at it!

Look, don't ever let a dragon know you're... you're afraid of him.

Can't stop shaking, and I am smiling.

Hello. Hello. Hello, Elliott.

Aah! Hey, see how smart he is?
- [Whimpering]
- He said hello to me.
Yeah! He likes me!
- Y-You do somethin' so he'll like you.

Yeah. Do somethin' to make him like you.

S-s-s-s-s-s...
- Saw it.
- Saw what?
El-El-El...
Dra-Dra-Dra...
What is an "el-el-el dra-dra-dra," hmm?
Dr-Dr-Dragon.
[Panting]
I-I saw the dragon.
L-Lampie wasn't lying.
Iùs real. It belched flame at me.
Belched?
You saw a belching dragon?
You sure you weren't belching yourself in front of the mirror?
N-Never saw anything so horrible in my life.
Th-Thought
I was a goner.
There was no need for him to do that.
I only offered him a sociable drink.
Hoagy, I can't stand you when you're drunk.
Doc, look at me.
I'm not drunk.
What I saw tonight sobered me in a second.
I swear... I swear to you, there's a big, horrible dragon... up in that cave, I swear.
I just realized,
I can't stand you when you're sober!
Now, get out of here. Get yourself a good, stiff drink. Out!
I swear.
A vicious dragon.
Out!
Dragon.
# [Humming]
Nine and nine are eighteen.
Really?
Nine times nine are eighty-one.
Amazing!
Two thousand pounds make a ton.
Wow!
That sign says "Passamaquoddy."
- You still have to go to school.
- Do I have to like it?
Like it or hate it, you have to go.
Do you wanna be stupid when you grow up, like the Gogans?
Okay, I like it.
I like it.
- Isn't that the boy with the dragon?
- I think so. Leùs go see.
Come on.
- Are you the boy with the dragon?
- Yep.
- Is it a he or a she?
- You don't name girls Elliott.
- Where is he?
- Following me.
- Elliott the dragon is walking right there.
- I can't seem to make out his colour.
- Mostly green.
- He's not too big, is he?
- Regular dragon size.
- Wow!
- Pete? School.
- Gee!
I ain't got hardly nothin' to sell.
So? I pulled my nets in, and there weren't a fish in 'em.
I just docked. There ain't nothin' out in that ocean but water.
Iùs real strange,
I'm tellin' ya.
Iùs like every fish sorta disappeared.
Just suddenly up and disappeared.
There's the cause of it.
That kid Pete.
From the day he come to town, the fishing turned sour.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Iùs that crazy dragon talk of his.
That kiÔs been nothin' but bad luck wherever he goes.
You're a bunch of superstitious ding-dongs.
You know that fishing grounds shift from time to time.
Ellioùll make the fish come back.
There he goes, talkin' dragons again.
Hey, kid! There ain't no room in this town for a dragon, and there ain't no room in this town for jinxes like you, neither!
Well, if there's enough room for a chowderhead like you, then there's more than enough room for a dragon.

You're late. You're late.
Late. Late. Late.
Late.
Why is everybody late?
We were playing with
Nora, Pete and his dragon.
- His wagon?
- No, dragon!
Dragon, wagon. Thaùs no excuse for being late. Get inside.
Good morning, Miss Taylor.
Good morning. Thank you for making my students late... and for disrupting the entire schedule.
- You have a new student.
- I have?
This is Pete.
Oh, him.
If he's a transfer,
I'll have to have his records.
Unfortunately, his old school burned down and his records were destroyed.
- Pete, give her nine times nine.
- Eighty-one.
Then I'll have to have his birth certificate.
Tragically, the flames from the school house... set fire to the city hall, and his certificate went up with it.
- Pete, give her a ton.
- Two thousand pounds.
Do you want him to spell
Passamaquoddy?
No, no, no. This is irregular, irregular, irregular.
But he needs an education, education, education.
Surely you can't disagree with that.
I would if I could, but I can't.
[Bell Ringing]
Why is the bell ringing?
There's no one out there.
I'll stop it.
- Elliott, stop it!
- [Elliott Chattering]
The bell isn't supposed to ring till recess!
- Stop that!
- I'm not doing it.
Liar. Liar, liar.
Iùs the knuckle cracker for you.
Three for lying and three... for whom the bell tolls. Come.
Put your hands out.
Palms down, knuckles up.
One. Two.
- Three! Four!
- It doesn't hurt much, Elliott.
- Whom are you talking to? Five, six!
- Elliott!
- Whom?
- My dragon.
- [Laughing]
- Your dragon, wagon.
Nothing but a network of lies!
Three more for your imagination!
Seven! Eight!
And a great big nine!
Go stand in the corner.
[Huffs]
Work, work, work, everyone.
All this nonsense about a dragon.
# [Elliott Humming]
- No, Elliott!
- You did it! You pulled the chair out from under me.
- It was Elliott.
- [Gasps] That does it.
You've had a taste of the knuckle cracker.
Now you'll have a dose of the behind breaker.
- Bend over.
- [Elliott Growling, Thumping]
[Screaming]
No, no, Elliott.
Get out!
[Elliott Grunting]
- [Crowd Chattering]
- [Elliott Growling]
No, Elliott, you're going about this the wrong way.
- Go back to the cave. Go on!
- [Elliott Grumbling]
[Man]
Jehoshaphat! Would you look at that!
- Why do I hear a bell ringing?
- School must be out.
Iùs too early, stupid.
See, I told you.
School is out.
- Wait! Whaùs happening?
- Pete's dragon wrecked the school!
I told you.
I told you!
[Man]
Whaùs happened over there? Something crashed right through the school.
Look at it, I'm telling you.
Iùs a big hole in the side of the wall.
And a dragon came in through one wall... and went out the other wall.
Now do you believe me?
[Chuckling]
- You think this kid Pete would sell it?
- Money talks.
First there's a dragon.
Now he tells me money talks.
Will miracles never cease?
Dragons, dragons, dragons.
Dragons.

Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?
At last we've seen the light.
[Chuckling]
I tell you, you've got to have a sense of humour these days.
- And you must be Pete.
- Yes, sir!
I'm Dr Terminus, and this is Hoagy, who's doing his internship with me.
I heard about the incident at school yesterday.
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- I realize you must be disturbed about it, and, uh, up to here in dragons.
You know, Pete, I have always loved dragons.
They're such wonderful creatures.
When they're not busy destroying things, of course.
I've had a dream since
I was your age that one day...
I would have my very own dragon.
I would consider my life to be fulfilled... and would be most grateful if you would sell me your dragon.
You wanna buy Elliott?
Sight unseen. As is.
We'll give him a good home. Bless him.
I couldn't sell him.
Sure you could! Thaùs what life is all about: Buying and selling.
- I'll give ya three dollars.
- [Whispering] Offer him four!
I'll offer him five.
Iùll make his head swim.
Five... dollars.
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.
- Well, what did ya do, rent him?
- Well, who owns him?
Well, nobody, I guess.
He just came to me.
He only goes to those who need him.
I need him.
Listen, Doc, I don't know what you're up to, but you better forget about this.
- He's not for sale.
- Nora, go paint your lighthouse.
Pete, my boy, you're conversant with Elliott.
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.
Deliver Elliott to me and the fiver is yours, plus a bottle of my medicine thaùs guaranteed to bring on puberty two years ahead of time, and thaùs better than a dragon, hmm?
[Chuckling]
- Doc, maybe you should talk to Elliott yourself.
- Mm-hmm.
Wh-Where is he?
Does he speak English?
Down the beach.
- Where?
- Right there, by the water.
- Right. I still don't see...
- Thaùs because he's invisible today.
[Laughing]
They know they're sitting on a gold mine.
Well, they've had their chance to make a few dollars.
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!
# We'll bind him up, grind him up
Lock him up, chop him up #
# Can't you hear that jingle-jangle sound #
- # Oh yeah #
- [Cackling]
# Iùs money, money, money by the pound #
- [Horn Blowing]
- Ahh!
[Laughing]
Uh! Ah-ah-ah!
[Laughing]
Fog! Fog!
- Where's the fog?
- There's not much fog.
We were just using the horn to chase off a few buzzards.
Few buzzards. Nora, how many times must l...
Oh, started already, huh?
Look, if you're gonna whitewash, son, let your brush go up and down, up... thaùs a boy... and down.
- Up and down. Up and down.
- Thaùs right.
- [Chuckling]
- This is fun.
If iùs so much fun, I'm gonna leave it to you and Nora to finish up... while I go in and take a nice little nap.
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Tell him, Nora.
Pete, Lampie and I have talked it over.
- We feel the time has come for you to stop running.
- Yes, iùs true.
If iùs all right with you, we'd like you to live here with us.
Oh, Nora, Lampie, do you mean this could be my real home?
- It certainly does.
- And Elliott too?
- Well, l...
- Sure, and Elliott too.
But Elliott has to live in the cave.
All right, he will.
- Oh.
- [Lampie Chuckling]
No, no, no!
Not on me! Not on me!
On the side of the building, please, huh?
- Now up... Up and down.
- And down. Up and down.
You know what?

Come on. Come on.
Whoa, boy. Say, have you seen anything of a mean, fresh kid...
'bout yea big?
Answers to the name of Pete.
Half of the kids in this town answer to the name of Pete.
Other half don't answer.
- Let me break his bones, Pa!
- Just a minute!
This particular Pete, he's always talkin'... to his big, hokey-pokey, uh, whatchamacallit, uh...
- Dragon.
- Dragon?
Merle, this here's the place.
Come on, Willie.
It would be unethical of me to leave my patient at a time like this.
Iùs important.
About the dragon.
Put your foot on there.
Now, don't move, stay tense, or that weight will fall, that clamp will break your jaw, tear your gums apart and go through your cheek.
- Tense. Tense!
- [Whimpering]
[Whimpering]
See that wagonload of worms? They're lookin' for the kid and the dragon.
I knew there'd be competition.
Come on.
[Lampie]
Careful as you bring 'em aside.
I got one!
I got one!
Ugh! Iùs ugly!
Well! If it ain't our own little Petey!
- [Cackling]
- The Gogans!
Well, you look so nice and clean, and those new clothes.
I guess all those good manners
I taught you done paid off.
Who's that pretty lady you're with, little Pete?
- Yeah. Introduce us.
- Yeah. Introduce us.
I'm Nora, and Pete is staying with me.
Why, boys, I believe she's tryin' to break up our happy little family.
Elliott went to look for Paul.
I wish he were here.
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.
I guess we're gonna take him back now, miss, to his own home, sweet home.
- Come on, Pete.
- You won't be taking him anywhere!
Okay, lady. We're gonna take him whether you like it or not.
- Right, boys?
- Right, Pa.
Willie, you grab onto Pete, while I hold onto her.
You grab Pete.
I wanna hold her.
- I wanna hold her!
- Well, I'm gonna hold her!
[Squabbling]
All right!
I'll settle this.
You two grab the brat.
I'll hold her.
Lf'n you think you're gonna hold her like my boys wanna hold her, you're gonna be holdin' your head, ya understand?
Lady, that boy is ours!
# We got a bill of sale right here #
# That says he belongs to us #
# We bought him fair and square last year #
# And we own the little cuss #
# Look here
Read the writin' #
# That gives us a legal claim #
[Gogans] # Oh, we got a bill of sale right here #
# With dear little Petey's name #
I don't believe it.
# We got a bill of sale in hand
And lady, if you don't budge #
# We'll pick you up right where you stand and bring you before the judge #
No, sir.
# That boy is our property same as the family cow #
# 'Cause we got a bill of sale right here, and we're gonna take him now #
- # You can't have him #
- # He's gotta do his chores #
- # You don't love him #
- # Paint the barn and wash the doors #
- # All you've done till now is break his heart #
- # Fix a broken fuse #
- # You'll abuse him #
- # He's the one that feeds the hogs #
- # And just use him #
- # His hands are for choppin' logs #
# Look out or I'll take you apart #
# We'd like to see you try it #
# We got a bill of sale right here
He's ours until he dies #
# Stay where you are, just one more move and you'll get it between the eyes #

[Sighing]
Iùs downright dangerous, getting all wet like this.
We done had our bath in May!
Ahh-ahh-ahh...
- [Sneezing]
- [Men] Bless you, Ma.
- [Coughing]
- Excuse me, folks.
I witnessed what happened today, and I'm completely sympathetic with you.
- Whaùs sympathetic mean?
- I'm Doc Terminus. Like to talk to you.
Oh, Doc, I got this here "poomonia."
- Sit down.
- Ahh-ahh-ahh...
[Sneezing]
- Bless you, Ma.
- Bless you, Ma.
[Groaning, Panting]
I got this terrible ache in my back!
Good. Whaùs rightfully yours is rightfully yours.
Now, you want Pete, right?
- Right!
- Right!
- Right!
I want... the dragon.
- The dragon?
- The dragon?
- [Laughing]
W-W-Wait a minute.
Now I got a stitch in my side.
You really want the dragon?
Very much. Mm-hmm.
Well, then, what are you willing to give for it?
The help you need getting Pete.
I'll need the same kind of help getting the dragon.
[Cackling]
[Laughing]
N-Now I think the pain's in my head!
- Have we got a deal?
- Sure.
We scratch your back, you scratch ours.
The boathouse, sunset, hmm?
Uh, Doc.
What you gonna do with a dragon?
Oh, maybe put him on a ranch, breed him. Hmm?
Big stud fees.
Ahoy. Ahoy. Here.
How would you like to make the fishing good again?
- How do we do that?
- Catch that dragon!
Set a trap for him, throw a net over him, drag him away.
Goodbye, Elliott.
Hello, fish. Hmm?
Sunset, the boathouse.
Spread the word, hmm?
[Fishermen Murmuring
In Agreement]
Get back!
Get back!
Dr Terminus! Here's that there harpoon you wanted!
Good! Put it right over there!
[Ma]
Now you just remember our bargain!
Okay, I want separate trip lines on the primary tarp, the secondary net and on the tertiary.
- T-Tertiary?
- Whaùs that?
Dragon medicine.
[Cackling]
- Okay, fix it.
- We've done it!
Don't signal till you're re...
- [Men Shouting]
- Get this net up off of me!
Will you get this... Will you get this net up! Up! Up!
Now, I've gotta go and get that kid.
You rehearse this and make it run like clockwork or else.
Elliott!
Oh, Elliott, you were terrific the way you saved us from the Gogans.
- [Laughing]
- What?
[Gibberish]
Do you mean it?
[Clicking Tongue]
Wow! Thaùs great.
You're the most wonderful dragon in the whole world.
[Soft Growling,
Clicking Tongue]
Wait till I tell Nora!
# [Humming]
Nora! Nora! Good news!
Elliott found Paul, and he's on his way home!
- Pete...
- I wouldn't say anything like that if I were you.
But iùs true.
Elliott said.
Please.
There's been enough talk about Paul, and Elliott too.
[Sighing]
Both of us have to be... realistic.
Paul's ship went down.
He's not coming back.
And I have to adjust my life to it.
You have to make a big adjustment too.
You have us now.
You don't have to make believe your only friend is a dragon.
But I'm not making believe.
Thaùs what I mean by "realistic."
There are no dragons.
Except for Elliott.
He's real.
Lampie, you've seen him, haven't you?
Well, l...
I thought I saw him.
Wait till Paul gets here. Then you'll know how realistic Elliott is.
Okay.
Until that time, leùs try not to talk about it.
How about filling the reserve oil can?
Sure.
Well, at least one of us is entitled to have illusions.
[Thunderclap]
[Wind Howling]
Pete! Pete, iùs Elliott!
- Whaùs the matter?
- Ellioùs in Passapaka... Pakadaka...
He's in town, and he's tearing the place apart.
- You've gotta do something.
- Oh, no!
[Laughing]
We should be in the channel.
We shoulÔve made
Passamaquoddy Light by now.
There it is!
Iùs my home port.
I didn't think I'd ever see it again.
- Iùs a welcome sight.
- Looks great to me.
I know the light keepers personally.
- He's in there! Come on!
- Elliott! Elliott!
Did I say the primary was really the tertiary?
[Men Shouting]
Never!
- Where's Elliott?
- Nowhere!
Your hokey-pokey dragon's out helping Santa Claus pull his sled!
- Boys!
- Let me go!
Now you're never gonna get away again!
We're gonna put chains on you when you're workin'!
- And when you're not workin'.
- And when you're sleepin'!
Okay, okay. Tear him to pieces in your own time.
Right now he is the bait for the trap.
Take him in there where that thing can see him when he comes through the door.
He'll head straight for Pete.
We spring the trap.
After the tertiary net drops on him,
I'll give you the signal, and you fire the harpoon right into the middle.
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Got it?
Got it!
But what I don't got is, h-h-how you gonna get that monster, that hideous beast, that nightmare sent by the devil, to come here?
Easy. We get someone he knows to bring him here.
Well, who'd be crazy enough to do that?
No! No!
He knows you.
He trusts you.
He scares me!
He hates me!
Hoagy.
We are all on this earth for a purpose, and the time for your purpose is now.
I know that inside this pale, frail, pathetic shell of a man... there is a Vesuvius ready to erupt.
Now, I've known you, man and beast, since, since you were nothing.
But now, Hoagy, now, you're still nothing, but you could be something!
You can be a somebody.
A legend, Hoagy. A legend in your own lifetime, not a joke!
The momenùs here, Hoagy.
Grab it. Grab it!
Today the jester.
Tomorrow the king!
- No!
- Get out!
[Whimpering]
[Elliott Snoring]
E-Elliott.
C-Can you come out here for a second? Please?
[Snoring]
[Gasping]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
Wake up.
W-W-Wake up!
[Snarling]
D-D-Don't get n-n-nervous!
I'm a friend.
[Groaning, Snorting]
Don't roast me!
[Snarling]
Boo!
- Ahh!
- [Laughing]
H-Hon... Honest.
L-l-I-I-I got a m-mess... m-m-m-message about P-P-Pete!
- T-The G-G-Gogans...
- [Snarling]
Got P-P-P-Pete!
- [Bellowing]
- Ahh!
[Snarling, Roaring]
Aaah!
Follow me!
[Thunderclap]
Captain, the lighùs gone!
There's a reef between us and the channel.
Dad, I can't find Pete.
- Can you get it lit?
- I have to put in a dry wick.
Battle stations!
[Hoagy] I told you!
I told you, Elliott! There he is!
Look out, Elliott!
Iùs a trap!
Aaah! Get him!
He's right here!
Drop everything!
Drop everything!
[Men Shouting]
[Elliott Bellowing]
Elliott, over here!
[Hoagy] Get me out of here!
Elliott, don't step on me!
- Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
- Iùs beginnin' to look like a...
- Dragon!
- Don't say that!
I've got it!
We've done it! Out!
We've got it!
We've got it!
- Hoagy!
- [Elliott Growling]
Please!
Please, let me out!
- Doc, please!
- Get out of there! Get out of there!
- Doc, get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!
- Okay. Okay!
[Growling]
- [Growling]
- [Men Shouting]
- Help! Over here!
- Don't say that!
Tie him down!
Help, Elliott, help!
Man this harpoon. Take this.
[Chuckling]
Light the fuse.
No, no!
Don't shoot Elliott!
[Ma Screaming,
Shouting]
[Pa]
Get him back! Get him back!
The other.
- [Pa] Pick him up!
- [Ma] Take him outside!
[Hoagy]
Get out of the way!
- [Whimpering]
- [Screaming]
He's going!
Let me get a bead on him!
- Elliott, save me!
- [Ma] Don't let him get away again!
Get him outta here!
- Hands...
- Elliott, don't let 'em take me!
[Growling]
[Roaring]
[Stammering]
Wait! Wait!
[Ma Shouting]
- [Muttering]
- [Gogans Whimpering]
Huh? Pete!
- Thanks, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
You just listen to me!
That there boy belongs to me!
I paid fifty dollars for him, plus legals, and I got a bill of sale right here to prove it.
[Snarling]
- Boo.
- [Screaming]
[Ma] Merle, help! Get me out of here!
Don't just stand there!
Come on! Get me outta here!
Get me out of here!
[Ma]
You clucks!
[Elliott Laughing]
- [Grunting, Groaning]
- [Ma] Let him keep the brat!
[Roaring]
[Ma]
Come on! Get in the wagon!
[Shouting]
[Ma]
Wait! Wait for us!
[Elliott Howling]
Daaah-ah-ah!
Aaah-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[Screaming]
Aaah! Doh!
Hoagy, get me down!
We've gotta do something!
That dragon's gonna get away!
[Snarling]
[Whimpering]
Where is he? Where is he?
Elliott! Wait!
Wait, Elliott!
I wanna make a deal with ya.
To buy up all your used and spare parts, you know, like a hangnail, or if you shed your skin, or if your hair falls out,
I'll pay you top dollar!
Whaùs the matter with you?
Don't you have any business sense?
- Don't shout!
- Elliott! Elliott!
[Screaming]
He's gonna eat us up!
[Growling]
Oh!
[Whimpering]
[Wagon Crashing]
...in the street.
Quite a storm here.
Wait a minute.
Watch those stairs.
- [Gasping]
- [Electricity Crackling]
Oh, look!
Th-Th-There really is a dragon!
Yes, and he saved us!
- Dragon!
- A dragon! A real dragon!
- Attaboy, Elliott.
- [Muttering]
[Clicking Tongue]
That ship's headed for the reef!
Go down and sound the foghorn!
[Foghorn Blowing]
Elliott, quick! Quick!
[Foghorn Blowing]
[Ship Creaking]
Nora, let me have the light so I can see what I'm doing.
[Foghorn Blowing]
Come on, Elliott.
You can do it.

Come on, Elliott.

- Come on, Elliott!
[Panting]
[Pete]
Hurry!
Whaùs the matter?
Everything is wet in here, thaùs whaùs the matter!
- Don't worry, Lampie. Elliott came.
- Elliott?
Thaùs all I need is a dragon in here. Ah!
Get him outta here!
[Muttering]
Start your burner, Elliott.
Light the wick.
[Gibberish]
- [Clicking Tongue]
- All right, Elliott. Go ahead. Light it.
[Pete]
Now, Elliott! Now!
All right.
Where's the fire?
- [Groaning]
- Whaùs the matter?
[Gibberish, Sputtering]
- He's all squished up in the stairs.

- [Gibberish]
He's real.
He's really real.
[Muttering,
Clicking Tongue]
- Of course he is.
He's gonna light the wick.
- Can he do it?
Can he? He can throw a flame clear across to Bar Harbor... if he can get his own burner goin'!
[Gasping]
- Come on, Elliott!
- [Whining]
- Go on!
Come on, Elliott!
Come on!
[Lampie]
Blow, Elliott!
[Drawing A Deep Breath]
- Wow! [Panting]
- [Pete] Elliott, you did it!
[Gibberish,
Clicking Tongue]
Look there!
That means the harbor is dead ahead, Captain!
Hard right rudder!
Elliott, I could give you a great big kiss.
[Shuddering]
# A dragon, a dragon
You bet we saw a dragon #
# So big and brave, he came to save a village in distress #
# He kept the ship from crashing when he heard the S.O.S. #
# He faced a group of villains and he fought them with success #
# He's great
He's great #
- # A chum #
- # A pal #
- # A mate #
# A dragon, a dragon
We're proud to love a dragon #
# Before he came to fight the storm the night was dark and dim #
# Now everyone in town is safe again because of him #
# He filled the ocean full of fish
He packed it to the brim #
# We want it known that he's our very own #
Nora! Nora!
Paul!
[Elliott Muttering]
- What happened?
- We sank in a storm off Cape Patters.
I was the only survivor.
When I woke up in the hospital,
I'd lost my memory.
Then the other day, a strange thing happened.
My bed suddenly tipped over.
I don't know how, but I bumped my head and everything came back to me.
- Iùs a miracle!
- [Chattering]
Iùs Elliott.
Gather around, everyone. I'm going to have a few appropriate words to say.
Gather around. Come on.
Closer, closer.
There you are, yes.
Iùs nice to see you.
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Pete, I want you to thank
Elliott the dragon... for the council here and all the townspeople.
- You do that?
- Well, he's right here.
He'd appreciate it if you'd thank him yourself.
- [Laughter]
- You mean I can talk right to him, huh?
Go right to the main source.
That was my campaign...
- No, he's over here.
- Oh! Oh, over that side.
So, uh, on behalf of...
[Laughter]
[Muttering]
Thank you.
# Iùs a brazzle dazzle day #
- # So throw off the past and everything in it #
- [Elliott Clicking Tongue]
# Thaùs the brazzle dazzle way #
# Enjoying your time from minute to minute #
Hi!
Oh, Elliott, you're the greatest.
You've made everybody happy, especially me.
I'm very proud of you.
[Muttering]
We've got a real family now and a place to live.
[Clearing Throat]
[Gibberish]
You've gotta go?
When will you be back?
[Gulping, Muttering,
Sniffling]
You... You won't be back?
[Muttering]
But why?
Did I do something wrong?
[Muttering]
[Snarling]
There's another kid in trouble?
[Muttering,
Growling]
[Soft Roar]
Well, if anyone can get him out of it, you can.
- Ohh...
- [Giggling]
[Muttering]
I won't see you again, will I?
Ever.
[Sniffling, Whimpering]
[Sniffling]
What are you sniffing for?
[Gasping, Sneezing]
[Laughing]
[Chuckling]
Now, remember, don't scare people.
[Gibberish]
Goodbye, Elliott.
Goodbye.
[Gibberish]
- It is a dragon!
- [Pete, Lampie, Nora] Iùs Elliott!
[Pete] And remember, you're supposed to be invisible!
NARRATOR:
A time of beginnings.
Of darkness.
Of light.
Of the sun.
The earth.
The sea.
Of man.
The beginnings of man living with man.
By the sea.
In the mountains.
The beginnings of love, hate and fear.
Man's fear of the unknown.
Man's fear lest the sun should leave him.
Leave him alone in everlasting darkness.
A time when the color of a woman's hair condemned her for sacrifice to the sun.
A time when there was, as yet, no moon.

in a thousand atomic fireballs.
The first blast was set off
by five terrorists.
It took two million years...
for some of the radioactive clouds
to allow some sun in.
By then, only a handful
of humans survived.
The rest of humanity had
changed into hideous mutants.
These mutant species
floundered in the bad areas...
radioactive lands that never allowed
them to become human again...
and made each birth a new disaster.
Then, in the good lands...
they came back,
arising from their long sleep...
fairies, elves, dwarves...
the true ancestors of man.
They lived happily in the good areas.
It was a big day in Montagar.
Delia, queen of the fairies...
was presiding over the feast of plenty...
celebrating 3,000 years of peace.
In the midst of the celebration...
Delia felt a pull from the skies.
She looked up
and saw dark clouds...
forming on the horizon in every direction.
She fell into a trance
and left the party...
heading for her home on a high hill.
At first, the fairies were puzzled.
But then they too felt
a force drawing them to follow.
Delia was alone inside.
The storm grew until
it was a raging cyclone...
hovering over the dwelling.
One of the older fairies
ventured inside the house.
There lay Delia on her bed...
holding a pair of twins in her arms.
The older fairy instantly knew that...
these were not ordinary twins,
but magical wizards.
The baby wizards were
polarized like magnets...
one attracting with a magnetic draw...
the other repelling
and impossible to get near.
Avatar, the kind and good wizard...
spent much of his boyhood...
entertaining his mother
with beautiful visions.
Blackwolf, the mutant wizard...
would never visit his mother...
and spent his time
torturing small animals.
More years passed,
and Delia continued to slip.
Finally, all life drained out of her...
and Avatar held her hand
trying desperately to use
his magic to restore her.
He cradled her in his arms and wept.
When Blackwolf found that
his mother had died, he was excited...
for now he felt he would take over
her leadership and rule the land.
When Avatar confronted
Blackwolf, he was enraged.
They began a furious battle.
Each using his magic, they continued...
until they had nearly destroyed each other.
But Avatar's magic was stronger...
because he had the emotional loss
of his mother that drove him on.
Blackwolf was defeated.
"The day will come, my brother,
when I will return...
and make this a planet
where mutants rule. "
Blackwolfheaded off,
leaving Avatar very disturbed.
The time has come.
Kill!
Well, hello, handsome.
Hello, honey.
He is called Necron 99.
He is one of Blackwolf's assassins.
He travels the land destroying
the believers of magic.
 "My children,
the only true technology is nature.
"All the other forms
of manmade technology...
"are perversions.
"The ancient dictators used technology... to enslave the masses."
- Weehawk, can't we stay here for tonight?
- No.
Just for a few hours' rest.
- I sense something.
- But the road is clear.
We haven't seen an assassin for days.
A clever assassin stays hidden.
Avatar must be warned.
Our mission is nearly over, Westwind... but now it's time for one final run.
Damn it!
- Well?
- They're not back yet, my president.
- They're really late now, aren't they, old wizard?
Bad magic, isn't it?
And if they don't show... you'll know no more than you did before.
- How true, fairy goddess of the New World... but if they don't show...
I think that will tell us something too.
Damn it, Avatar! If there's any danger... maybe we should... maybe we should arm our states.
- Science and technology?
- There's no time for that.
Even if we could impress our people with the danger... science and technology were outlawed... millions of years ago... and, we must admit... it's been a peaceful world since then.
Enough, Wizard!
I demand to know what you know...
- or I'll banish you!
Banish him?
But, Father, who will teach me... all the magic I've left to learn?
Only Avatar can make me... a full-fledged fairy.
As you can see, I'm only half there.
All right. All right.
I'll tell you... if you think you can handle it.
What do you know
about war, about bombs...
that could turn
a planet molten and liquid?
To think it could start again... ten million years after the final one.
Sometimes I get tired of being so old.
Sometimes... being a wizard is lonely at the top.
We're waiting, old, old wizard.
You know about my brother.
Well, as the years passed...
I searched for my brother in vain.
He had settled in the dark land of Scortch...
where people still died of radiation.
 For 5,000 years,
Blackwolf studied black arts...
increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold.
He built a small following
of frog-like creatures...
but needed more troops
for his evil plans.
He then formed an army
whose generals were called up...
from the black shadows of hell.
Souls who waited for untold eternities
for a new leader...
Blackwolf's tremendous power...
enslaved them all to carry out his will.
Then stories of Blackwolf's armies...
attacking neighboring countries came back.
Demons of hell armed with black magic...
but they would get bored...
or sidetracked in the middle of battle...
and give up, running home.
Fritz! Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Those despicable, animal warmongers!
They've killed Fritz!
Take that! Take this!
Take that, you green slime!
- You black-hearted, short bow-legged...
- Max!
Max, I'm okay! I'm okay, Max.
Just a scratch.
- Look, I'm all right.
- Oh. Oh, damn.
There you go again stepping on my lines... raining on my parade, costing me medals.
Oh, damn!
Ohh. Oh, Fritz?
Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz!
They could easily have won,
but they lacked...
the motivation and inspiration.
Blackwolfknew he needed more.
He sent his huge armies out
to excavate ancient ruins...
for links to the past.
Tales reached Avatar that bits and pieces
of pre-holocaust technology...
were being dug up and marched
back to Scortch I.
With these ancient pieces...
he built a new war machine.
Still, his generals
needed more to fight with.
This drove Blackwolf mad with frustration.
Then one day, that frustration vanished.
I sent my elf spies to find out what was happening.
I'm sure he has found some great power... that will control his armies.
You mean you sent out that elf envoy... to investigate based on a vague feeling of your...
I've failed you, my wizard.
I've failed you, my president.
What news do you bring?
The lights went out! The lights went out!
Necron 99 has destroyed himself.
It's done!
With the assassination of the presidents of the free states... comes their fall... and that of my brother.
It's done.
We have four more lights left, sir... four more.
It's not important!
The main exterminations are complete.
The remaining countries are now ruled...
by second-rate incompetents...
so confused...
that even now they blame the killings...
on those within their own ranks.
It's time to strike!
Sieg heil.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, lard bottom.
- Get up. Blackwolf's callin'.
- I don't want to go.
Hey, when Blackwolf calls, we go.
- I don't want to fight anymore.
- Ya gotta.
- I don't want to hurt things anymore.
- Hey, you're so stupid.
Listen, I ain't stupid. Just listen.
You know what I mean, trees, birds, butterflies...
Everything's got a right to live. You know what I mean?
- Hey...
- Everything! Everything's got a right to live.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Butterflies...
Blackwolf's got a secret weapon that makes us invincible.
We can't lose.
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left. Right, left...
It will never work.
People don't want war.
It destroyed this planet, its people... and all records of past civilizations.
Not all records, as you'll soon find out.
Attention!
Leaders of tomorrow's master race!
The time has come, as I promised...
a time when I reveal to you... my loyal followers...
the ancient secret of war... the key to creating hysteria... fear... gods.
Behold!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Blackmark's army's come again!
Our cousin elves are already in the trenches.
It's our loved land too.
For Elfin and Fairyland, united we fly.
Hey, Elfie, do you hear those drums?
Sure do, Peewhittle.
I don't believe those blokes are gonna try it again.
I'm scared.
Now don't be, governor.
You're too young to remember... but Blackwolf must have lost one million men here... last time he tried to invade.
And if Blackwolf's
stupid enough to try it again...
he'll lose twice more.
Them goblins and demons... just look mean, but they're yellow.
They got no cause to fight.
They always give up and run
with our arrows chasing them...
all the way home.
It's always been that way and will always be the same.
Ain't that the truth, boys?
Weehawk, what's that
old wizard been doing for four hours?
If he's looking for answers from that assassin... my father's sword can get it quicker than brain reading.
Cool down.
Cool down.
I got it, and it ain't good.
The key is a dream machine... that inspires armies with ancient war images.
It must be destroyed.
It is in Blackwolf's castle in the land of Scortch.
When do we leave?
Leave?
What do you mean, leave?
You got to be kidding.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
Just wake me up when the planet's destroyed.
- Well, I'm not too old. I'll go myself.
- Very noble.
We're going.
I must avenge my father's death.
It ain't no fairyland out there, kid.
But all right, all right.
I was just testing you.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, what now?
Uh, I don't know.
Oh, why don't you sit there for a couple hours while I figure it out?
Okay.
- Uh, Avatar.
- All right. All right.
How do we find this machine?
This creature, uh,
I shall call him Peace.
Peace?
In the hopes that he will bring it.
He's somehow wired to the machine.
And the only freedom he'll ever have from its painful grip... is in its destruction.
Go now, both of you, and prepare for the journey.
- I'll reason with him when he awakens.
- Avatar, you're not that old.
She's gotta be kiddin'.
Looks like my brother and I now begin our final battle.
Weehawk spent a night
saying good-bye to his tribe...
asking them to protect his family...
and to name a new chief
ifhe did not return.
Elinore said good-bye to her father
and then the other fairies of her kind.
She told them she will return
as queen of Montagar...
her father's death revenged...
and herself a full-fledged fairy.
Well, they're here, nut.
I'll be right down, heroes.
All right, creep.
Now, before I untie you...
I wanna tell you a couple things.
And I want you to listen and listen carefully.
This has been the biggest bummer of a trip I've ever been on.
If you let me down or you hurt my friends...
especially the broad...
I got stuff planned for you...
- that'll take 20 years to kill you.
- No pain.
And you'll be screaming for mercy
in the first five seconds.
Peace wants love... wants free, will help.
Look, just get us there, you got it?
Don't be sad,
Elinore.
I'll kill that monster as soon as he shows us that projector.
Are you kids ready?
You know, this Peace here,
he knows every step towards Scortch.
I promised him life without pain... uh, life without fear...
- I still don't trust him.
- H-Hey.
You're both forgetting you have the protection of a powerful wizard here.
Damn it.
He's getting older but not much bolder.
I wonder if I packed my scotch.
Sing us a song, Elinore.
I don't want to.
But that's why we brought you. Come on.
Where's daddy? What is he doing?
He's guarding our home, son.
There's been a war, and this land has lost.
Why can't we fight and win, Mommy?
Because they have
weapons and technology.
Wejust have love.
Hey, Louie, What are we gonna do with the prisoners?
How do I know?
They're findin' out right now.
Duuuhhh.
What is this place?
- Dumbo, it's religion, man.
Ain't you heard?
- Religion?
Yeah. Blackwolf says the responsibilities of the prisoners... is up to the priests inside.
Now, what we got to do, dumbo... is reconnoiter the priests and find out.
What is all this?
Bits and pieces of religion, man.
What's the matter
with you?
Holy objects they saved
for millions of years, man.
- What are we looking for?
- Hey, so dumb.
We're looking for the priests, man, the priests.
Why?
I don't know.
I guess because you need
God on your side, stupid.
Who's that?
Who's that?
- That's them. Them. Them.
- Who's that?
Uh, listen, you guys.
We hates to interrupt you, you know.
- We're sorry.
- Yeah. But, uh, you see, Blackwolf...
- you know, our führer...
- It wasn't our fault.
Uh, shut up, will you?
Blackwolf, the führer,
started this war, see.
We got all these prisoners
we don't want to feed...
We ain't got time for that.
Wejust got time for war.
So, we were, uh...
I want to ask you guys...
He's asking you, not me.
Yeah, I'm asking if you want
to take care of'em, it's okay with us.
- Me too. Me too.
- Yeah, see?
- Yeah. Okay, dumbo.
- Okay.
- My sons, you say you are the victors.
- Uh-huh.
- But there is only one victor.
- Mmm.
That's Him.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Patience.
- We must first observe sundown and pray.
- He's got a point.
Hear us, O Lord. Hear our petition.
O Lord, we cry out to you.
Lord, hear our prayer.
Hear the prayers of thy humble servants.
O Lord, God, Lord, God... do not fail us in our hour of need.
We need you, O Lord.
We cry to you, O Lord.
Lord, help us.
Help us, O Lord.
We need you. We cry to you.
We cry out to you!
Hey, enough already.
O Lord, God, Lord, God.
All right, it's been five hours.
Time's up.
Okay, Charlie. It's no good.
- Put plan "A" to work.
- It's about time.
Okay, babe. They ain't gonna talk.
- Gimme plan "B".
- Hey, what's plan "B"?
Hey, hey, hey. Watch.
Will the birth be soon?
Very soon, my Lord.
You're young to be queen.
But deliver me a son...
and you shall help me rule this planet.
I don't want to rule this planet, my Lord.
- Just our kingdom is enough.
- Enough?
Enough for mutants to stay in their place, huh?
Live with radiation so our bodies crawl with hell?
We will live in the good lands.
My son will grow where there isn't death... in the very waters we drink and the air we breathe.
Wise men... will my son be human or mutant?
Mutant, the charts say, my Lord.
The next one won't be.
Do not have it killed, Oh, Lord!
It is not his fault!
Wait a minute, Avatar.
Peace is taking us towards the mountain fairies' domain.
We should go around.
Avatar, why is Peace stopping?
Fairy bad.
Not good. Go around.
Coming from Mr. Nice guy here... those fairies must be something else.
Go on, nut. We'd lose time.
Bad fairies.
Elves and fairies are bad-blood cousins.
I'm not in the mood for their pranks.
They may have useful information.
Don't worry. Time has passed.
Much of the rivalry between fairy and elf has subsided.
Barbarians.
Gee, they're adorable.
Oh. Hey!
# Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha #
Holy chrome!
Oh. Hey.
By my sword, that is no way to treat a lady.
Hey! Oh!
Stop this childish display.
Why, even at elves' houses,
I've seen more sophisticated magic.
All right. All right. You've had it.
This is Avatar the Great you're fooling with.
Avatar, consul and wizard of your great-grandfathers' consuls...
who was turned into Avatar the Old.
Yeah, that's me...
Avatar the Old now... but I still got my powers.
And you've cost me my patience.
I call upon all forces of darkness.
Oh, winds of abysses howling through the stars...
and eons of centuries.
O Lords of the Whirlwind,
black, gray and white...
I call upon you.
Oh, ever-increasing darkness...
shapeless and mindless beings...
corroded and rotten
in your hearts, body and mind...
I summon you from your ancient, timeless travels... to ride the winds of blackness.
And cabash!
Please accept our apologies for the behavior of some our more carefree brothers.
I'm Sean, leader of the Knights of Stardust... protectors of Dolan, king of the mountain fairies.
We have prepared a feast to welcome you to our humble domain.
Listen here, you little winged squirt.
- Do you realize...
- Oh, Avatar, stop being so grumpy.
Oh... I... Hey, Oh...
Ohh.
All right. Okay. Okay.
I'm Avatar the Great, as you've heard.
Now, this here is Elinore, queen of Montagar.
What brings you here?
Oh, we're on a quest
to the land of Scortch.
 You're heading for Scortch?
I'm afraid you're in for trouble.
Will you tell us what you know?
Steady, Westwind.
We'll eat alone, lest we sit with fools.
Meecher, where's Peace?
- Arise, you fools!
- Hey, what's that?
Assassin! Technology...
By the soul of Dulac and Rackham!
- Elinore is gone!
- It was Peace!
I knew we should have killed him when we had the chance!
Never mind. We must find Elinore.
The fairies have taken her into the mountain.
Hey, there's no time to waste.
No one's ever been to the fairy sanctuary before.
- It's forbidden to all.
- Drums.
It begins.
Quickly now, or all is lost.
You must save Elinore. Hurry, old fool.
Morro crinkle frizetta.
Enough magic, old man. Run!
Very bad. Not good. Not good.
Destroy her! She's party to death!
Sean is dead! Killed by lies and human technology.
Will it be brother against brother here too?
Only humans kill their own kind.
She allowed technology and death... into the Golden Circle.
She is a traitor.
Traitor?
You fools, release me.
Stay back!
As the king's guards... we can't allow you near until the king has ruled.
No one rules over Elinore of Montagar.
We rule.
We rule over death, lies, and deceit.
We rule.
She's emoting. I feel her pain.
It hurts! It hurts!
Wow!
Avatar never told me
I had full fairy powers.
He said I wasn't ready yet.
I told you, she's dangerous.
Destroy her while there's still time.
I say destroy her, king's rule or not.
Now why'd you want to go and do that for, love?
It's hard enough controlling them as it is.
Release me, or I, Elinore, shall show all you ants something.
- Stop him, miss. Stop him!
- Oh, did I do that?
Stop! I command you to cease.
Okay. Leave everyone alone.
I say, miss, you better stop him.
I think it would be better if you released me and we all ran away.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Holy chrome.
Elinore's really gone and done it.
It's all a disaster.
Well, old man, what are you going to do about it?
You better hurry, miss.
Avatar the Great...
- coming.
- Avatar!
Yeah.
You can kill me now, I'm sure.
I've given myself to you.
- I make no attempt to save myself.
- Save yourself?
Save yourself? Save me!
I can't, Elinore.
The only one who could might be the king here.
My mission, O Lord, is to save the world from another holocaust.
Sean was killed not by us,
but by my brother's assassins...
who have been sent to kill
Weehawk, Elinore...
Peace, and myself
before we reach Scortch.
For all I know and fear,
Weehawk is dead.
So might be Peace.
I ask for permission to take the girl and myself... to try to complete our mission alone...
though it does seem doomed now.
I will not allow you to hurt Elinore... without a fight by myself.
My brother lies, my good King!
Avatar! Avatar!
What will it be, King?
Time's getting short.
Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit?
We have been sent death... images and humans... each with a different story.
Something happening here.
Not you, please. Oh, no.
I have always been very good... and could even be better sometimes.
It starts again.
The only act that has been real so far... is the fact that Avatar did not break his word.
When the arrow struck him, he did not fight back.
And from what we all heard
about Avatar's power...
- that is surely the sign of truth.
We will neither join nor hinder nor help these two.
We will wait and see.
That is our decision.
Well, we're out of there.
Ouch!
Thanks.
I forgot about that.
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, no. Let me help you.
How's that?
It's very pretty, Avatar.
Yeah, well, it could be warmer.
We might as well begin.
This is the way, I think.
Scortch lies somewhere over these mountains.
Well, good morning.
Cozy morning, huh?
Avatar, we're trapped.
It's nothing a little
hard work won't cure.
Here. Follow me, Snow Queen.
I'm so cold, so cold.
Is it much farther?
Elinore, we've rested long enough.
We'd better move on.
Just a little while longer, Avatar.
I'm so tired.
Well, okay.
I'll go over and see if I can see a pass or a path or a... or a house or... something.
Oh, my God.
They're our own tracks.
We've been moving in circles.
I better not tell Elinore.
It'll do her no good.
Avatar, riders!
Run! Assassins come to finish the job!
We'll cut their throats.
Let them come.
Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch.
They split up.
Going to come at us from each end.
- Avatar, we really tried, didn't we?
- Yes, Elinore.
That's all anyone really could have done.
Steady.
Here they come.
Braxis plaxis traxis!
Montagar forever.
Death, assassins!
Peace! Peace, we found them!
We found them!
What took you so long?
Quickly, Peace. Quickly.
Let's get them off this glacier.
The quest is saved.
 The night
was spent in the protection of a cave.
Elinore and Weehawk slept as
Avatar counseled with Peace...
on the quickest route to Scortch.
The journey took them past the ruins...
of ancient civilizations.
Strange beasts lurked about...
but the dangerous mutants
that lived there were gone...
gone to Blackwolf's army.
All they left were their wives,
hurling insults and rocks...
as the party passed through.
Then finally, the desert.
Yeah, I feel it too.
Please do not attempt to draw your gun.
Avatar, you old fool! You've come!
Oh!
Our father's returned.
Avatar... fighter!
Avatar... father, mother, freedom!
Love, life!
We've been camping in the desert... away from prying eyes.
- Where did you get the guns, Abdul?
- Guns!
Well, we got them from old Blackwolf himself.
You mean you joined with...
No, no.
We ambushed a wolf patrol... took everything except their women... and two days from now, we attack Scortch I.
What do you mean, attack?
The remaining elves of the free world... have joined under my banner.
That banner will be carried to Scortch I.
Join us, old wizard.
We desperately need you.
Is this how you're repayin' me?
Stand back.
Avatar will not be touched.
When our world was young, so was mighty Avatar.
Misty moons ago...
he strode this planet like a messiah...
curing radiation sickness
from man and bird...
cleaning the planet of its filth.
It was Avatar who fought alongside my father... against the first mutant attack.
So now we have our messiah back again.
He's going to destroy
his brother for us.
With what?
A woman-child, one elf... and a moron robot.
Oh, Avatar.
- What is it?
- It's Blackwolf.
He's trying to gain control.
Back! Back!
Back to hell!
You can't have him!
You did it.
You beat the demon.
What's happened?
Well, I suddenly felt very sorry for Peace... so I went over to him, and I took his hand and I tried to comfort him.
Peace is in constant mental battle with Blackwolf.
Your kind words took his mind off the battle.
It allowed Blackwolf his chance.
Avatar. What's that?
Trapped.
- Jump, Peace!
- Jump, Peace!
Elinore!
Elinore!
Ah, I don't know.
I just don't know.
I don't know what happened to Elinore.
Betrayal of Elinore to the quest has broken his heart.
There is nothing wrong with him.
Tomorrow morning, the attack begins.
- Avatar, we have to go now.
- Oh, whatever.
The cliffs of Scortch can be seen.
- We have to go now to complete our mission.
- Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- How?
- We have to swim in.
Oh. Okay.
What's happened to the world?
I don't know.
I can remember back...
All the fairies were so good...
We're here. Scortch.
Chrome!
Come. We'll walk right up the road... and no one will expect it.
- We'll act like slaves.
- Yeah.
The castle. I see it.
It's quite a distance.
I had one where the whole country would disappear for a day.
Ohh.
That was, uh...
That was really, uh...
I just don't know.
Over there.
That must be the entrance... to the lower cities.
Now, guards might be about. Come on.
Hmm. How ugly.
How ugly. Kapow!
Boom. Boom.
I just don't know.
Maybe... Maybe I should make a deal with them.
Chrome.
Which way? I don't know.
You know, I should have stayed with them.
- They love magic.
- Shh.
- Avatar, just stay quiet.
- Yeah. Oh.
Psst. Hey, General.
Want to buy an elf hat? Elf beard?
Souvenirs for sale.
Precious souvenirs for sale.
- Get them while they're still hot.
- No more wars, you fools... love.
Scortch can be beautiful too.
Look, look. Real, beautiful presents.
Now, that-that... that is a wonderful trick.
- Wonderful.
- It's Avatar. Oh, General.
It's him. It's bad.
It's come to hurt the führer.
Kill it.
Oh, master, kill it.
That's impossible.
That dirty old man is Avatar the Great?
If that is so... then I am a warthog's uncle!
Funny you should say that.
Kiyah!
Ki-Kiyah!
Oooowah!
The enemy is dead.
Oh, master, the enemy is dead.
My God! What have I done?
Master loves Larry.
Master feeds Larry.
What are elves good for?
Avatar, good luck!
The beast has shown us the way to the castle.
I'm sorry, Weehawk.
I'm just an old fool.
You know... the world owes you much, kid... even if we don't take another step.
God! Avatar, get down.
I've seen him.
You can't beat him. He's too strong.
Avatar, don't do it.
You may be right... but I gotta battle my brother.
You find an entrance into the castle.
Smash the projector, and tell Elinore... that Avatar will die with her tonight... even if we win.
Hello.
You have aged, old fool.
The world is mine.
- Weehawk!
- Slut!
Weehawk, don't!
Weehawk, don't! Don't! Don't!
Stop, elf!
Blood on blood flowing, fathers and sons dying... brothers and lovers spilling false hate and rivers of life flowing away.
Fool elf! Think your sword is always quick, but what else?
Think!
Weehawk, I could not help it.
When I touched Peace in the desert...
Blackwolf trapped my mind.
I'm not as strong as Peace. It hurts.
Avatar must know.
The trouble with you, my brother... is that you've always been too good.
Well, that may be.
But I still think I look more like Ma than you do.
You know, uh, lots of character.
I'm agin' better.
Brother, there is no need for me to destroy you.
Surrender.
Surrender your world.
You always did need an audience, you sap.
Let me tell ya...
I ain't practiced much magic for a long time.
I wanna show you a trick Mother showed me when you weren't around... to use on special occasions like this.
Ah. Oh, yeah, one more thing...
I'm glad you changed your last name, you son of a bitch.
Avatar!
Elinore's no traitor!
She was possessed by Blackwolf.
It is done! It is done!
The world is free!
The projector destroyed,
the battle was over.
Shadow creatures
froze in their tracks.
Some faded...
some crawled back to hell.
Mutants... leaderless... ran.
Elves swept the beaches clear of the few
remaining mutants that still fought...
- As hundreds of circling black birds...
screamed at the carnage below.
There was some rejoicing.
But mostly, everyone wished
to return home quickly...
to tell their loved ones
that the war was won...
Hitler was dead again...
and that they could live
once more in peace...
in the land they loved so much...
God-given. Amen.
God-given. Amen.
Avatar! Look what I caught!
Don't hurt Larry. Larry served.
Beast of a thousand scales...
Hey, hey, hey. Set it free.
It's harmless without Blackwolf.
Pity it. It's not its fault.
Mmm. So be it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, master.
We ride back to Montagar.
Weehawk, you ride back to Montagar alone.
Avatar and I will start a new kingdom somewhere.
You will rule Montagar as their new king.
Are you and Avatar married, my Queen?
Hey, kid, take it easy, huh?
You did a good job, but don't get carried away.
You think Avatar's too old to get married?
Weehawk, how many years do wizards live, 10,000 or more?
And I got at least a thousand left, you know what I mean?
Forgive me, Avatar.
Forgive me, both of you.
For Montagar, forever.
Well, come on. Let's make it.
Avatar,
You're getting older and much bolder.
Come on! I meant let's make it out of here.
Sure you did.
THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE
"Once upon a time..."
"Somewhere on the Castilian plain, around 1940..."
The movie's coming!
The movie's coming!
You boys are gonna fall.
How are you?
What are you doing?
Get out of here!
Look at all the cans of film!
Let me through.
- What's the movie about?
- The movie?
It's wonderful.
Is it a horror movie?
Is that all?
Is it a cowboy movie?
It's a beautiful movie.
Are there Indians in it?
It's tremendous!
The best I've ever shown in this town.
You can't even imagine.
All I can say is: olé!
This evening, in the town hall, at 5:00 there'll be a special showing of Frankenstein.
Ticket prices will be one peseta for adults and two reales for children.
How's it going, Tomasa?
I hope it's good this time.
It's magnificent.
Don't start a fire, now.
Careful with that brazier.
The film's producers do not wish to present it without a preliminary word of caution.
This is the story of Dr. Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a living being, without recognizing that that's something only God can do.
It's one of the strangest stories ever told.
It's about the great mysteries of creation:
Iife and death.
Prepare yourselves.
You may be shocked, or even horrified.
Few films have had greater impact all over the world.
But I would advise you not to take it too seriously.
Though nothing can bring back the happy moments we spent together,
I pray that God grant me the joy of seeing you again.
That's been my constant prayer ever since we parted during the war, and it's my prayer still here in this remote spot where Fernando and the girls and I try to survive.
Little but the walls are left of the house you once knew.
I often wonder what became of everything we had there.
I don't say that out of nostalgia.
It's hard to feel nostalgic after what we've been through these past few years.
But sometimes, when I look around me and see so much loss, so much destruction and so much sadness, something tells me perhaps our ability to really feel life has vanished along with all the rest.
I don't even know if this letter will reach you.
The news we get from outside is so scant and confusing.
Please write soon to let me know you're still alive.
With all my love, Teresa.
Sit down.
Sit down.
See that?
He understands!
Look at that!
Teresa.
Milagros.
Have you seen my wife?
I think she went out a while ago.
- Where are the girls?
- At the movie.
Is there anything to eat in the house?
I'm sure there is.
But you should eat regular meals and come down out of the clouds.
Sit down, Doctor.
Try to be patient.
Did you expect immediate results?
You must keep a close eye on your creature.
Listen to me.
It could be dangerous.
Dangerous?
You surprise me.
Haven't you ever wanted to take a chance?
What if we never went beyond the limits of the known?
Have you never wished to see beyond the clouds and stars?
Or to know what makes trees grow and changes shadows to light?
But speak like this and they call you a madman.
Yet if I could answer just one of these questions - what eternity is, for example -
I wouldn't care if they called me mad.
You're young, dazed by your success.
Wake up and see reality.
A demon whose brain -
You must give it time to develop.
It's a perfect brain, Doctor.
I can tell you this now:
It came from your laboratory.
The brain stolen from my laboratory belonged to a criminal!
- Will you be long, Papa?
- No, I'll just fix the wall.
Why don't you stay and play with me?
I have things to do, child.
Play with your kitten.
- Good-bye, Papa.
- Good-bye.
And be good.
Who are you?
I'm Maria.
Will you play with me?
Would you like one of my flowers?
This one's for you and this one's for me.
It's like a boat.
See how they float?
Get ready, Maria.
I'll check the roof and then we'll go to the village.
Isabel.
Why did he kill her?
Why did he kill her?
Silence!
I'll tell you later.
It's Frankenstein!
By the sign of the holy cross free us from our enemies,
Lord our God.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.
Where did you hide the matches?
In the drawer.
What?
Tell me what you were going to tell me.
- About what?
- The movie.
Not now. Tomorrow.
Now. You promised.
Why did he kill the girl, and why did they kill him after that?
You don't know.
You're a liar.
They didn't kill him, and he didn't kill the girl.
How do you know?
How do you know they didn't die?
Everything in the movies is fake.
It's all a trick.
Besides, I've seen him alive.
Where?
In a place I know near the village.
People can't see him.
He only comes out at night.
Is he a ghost?
No, he's a spirit.
Like the spirit Dona Lucia talks about?
Yes, but spirits don't have bodies.
That's why you can't kill them.
But he had one in the movie.
He had arms and feet.
He had everything.
It's a disguise they put on when they go outside.
If he only comes out at night, how can you talk to him?
I told you he was a spirit.
If you're his friend, you can talk to him whenever you want.
Just close your eyes and call him.
"It's me, Ana."
"It's me, Ana."
"Someone to whom I recently showed my glass beehive, with its movement like the main gear wheel of a clock-
Someone who saw the constant agitation of the honeycomb, the mysterious, maddened commotion of the nurse bees over the nests, the teeming bridges and stairways of wax, the invading spirals of the queen, the endlessly varied and repetitive labors of the swarm, the relentless yet ineffectual toil, the fevered comings and goings, the call to sleep always ignored, undermining the next day's work, the final repose of death far from a place that tolerates neither sickness nor tombs -
Someone who observed these things, after the initial astonishment had passed, quickly looked away with an expression of indescribable sadness and horror."
Two and two is four
Four and two is six
Six and two is eight
Plus eight is 16
Plus eight is 24
Plus eight is 32
Holy souls, we kneel before you.
AII right.
Put away your things.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Or else Don Jose will get angry.
Good morning, Don Jose.
Poor Don Jose!
Who left him like that?
You did, teacher!
Let's see, Paulita.
What is Don Jose missing?
- His heart.
- Good. Put it on him.
Mari Carmen, what's the heart for?
For breathing.
All you smarty-pants laughing so hard, what do we breathe with?
The lungs.
Show them to us.
Put his lungs on.
Put them on him.
Very good.
What is the stomach for?
To put food in.
Put it on him.
Very good. Sit down.
Now pay attention.
Don Jose can walk.
He can breathe.
He can eat.
But... there's still something very, very important that's missing.
His bones.
His ears.
Ana.
You're very quiet.
What is Don Jose still missing?
His eyes.
Quiet, Isabel.
Answer when I ask you.
- His eyes.
- Very good.
Come and put them on him.
Now Don Jose can see.
See the house with the well?
- Does he Iive there?
- Yes.
You want to go there?
AII right.
Isabel!
Mama asked about you this afternoon.
She wanted to know where you were.
I said you were still at school.
Did you go to the well?
Yes.
Did you see him?
No.
Because he doesn't know you.
Papa's coming!
Papa's coming!
Papa, here's one.
- Papa, here's another one.
- I'm coming.
It's bad.
How much you wanna bet?
Don't touch it.
- It's good, isn't it?
- Let's see.
Yes, sir, that's a good mushroom.
See?
Who knows what it's called?
- A brittlegill.
- A flyswatter.
No, flyswatters are poisonous.
Look closely.
Trum...
- Trumpet!
Very good.
You can tell by the brown color and these wavy edges.
Papa, have you ever picked a poisonous mushroom?
- No. You know why?
- Why?
Because I always do
Iike my grandfather told me.
If you're not sure a mushroom's good, don't pick it.
Because if it's bad and you eat it, it's your Iast mushroom, and your Iast everything else too.
You two understand?
- I do.
Grandfather wasn't crazy about eating them.
What he Iiked was Iooking for them, even if it meant a full day's hike.
He never got tired.
See that mountain?
What he called
"the mushroom garden" is up there.
You know why?
- Why?
Because the best mushroom grows there - the chanterelle.
- Why don't we go?
- It's too far.
We'd never make it with you two weaklings.
We'll go some other day.
But first you have to promise never to tell your mother.
Look what we have here.
A real devil.
It smells so good.
Sure, the young ones fool you, but the older ones are a different story.
Look very closely.
Look at the color of the cap and the black gills.
Never forget, girls:
This is the worst of all.
The most poisonous.
Whoever eats this hasn't got a chance in the world.
Fernando.
See you Iater.
- Good morning, Don Fernando.
- Good morning.
We're getting a Iate start.
- You hit me!
- I did not!
That's enough!
Stop being so boisterous.
- Dummy!
- Pig!
Good Lord!
What's all this ruckus?
- She started it.
- That's enough!
She's Iying.
Come on.
It's time to wash up for school.
First you get the brush wet.
Okay.
Then you rub it all over your face.
Then you get it soapy.
Now you rub it on your face.
Okay.
Now I shave off the Iittle hairs?
Yes, and then you put on some cologne.
Mama, do you know what a spirit is?
You don't know and I do.
A spirit is a spirit.
Are they good or bad?
With good Iittle girls, they're very good, but with bad girls, they're very bad.
But you're always a good girl, aren't you?
Give me a kiss.
It's coming!
"Now neither malice nor hatred, nor even the fear of change.
I only feel thirst, a thirst for I know not what.
Rivers of Iife, where have you gone?
Air, I need air.
What do you see in the darkness that makes you silently tremble?
I see not but only stare Iike a blind man facing straight into the sun.
I shall fall where the fallen never rise."
"To... my... dear... misanthrope."
Come here.
What's wrong with you?
Come on, get up.
Stop playing around.
He's not here anymore.
He's gone.
Isabel, tell me what happened.
Milagros!
- Careful, you'll get burnt.
- Isabel!
Careful, Raquel.
What are you doing here, child?
Come on, Iet's go.
Let's go home.
Your father's back.
Let's go.
Come on, Iet's go.
Where were you?
Where were you?
Here.
Hello.
Come in.
- May I, sir?
- Come in.
- He's here.
- I'll be right there.
Ana, come here!
Get back!
Ana, what happened to you?
- Miguel, how is she?
- Fine. Still a Iittle weak.
She hardly sleeps.
She won't eat or speak.
Light bothers her.
She Iooks our way but doesn't recognize us.
It's as if we didn't exist.
Ana is still a very small child.
She's under the effect of a powerful experience.
But she'll get over it.
Really, Miguel?
Bit by bit she'll begin to forget.
The important thing is that your daughter's alive.
She's alive.
She's gone to sleep.
Don Miguel, she's asleep.
Give her this medicine.
The dose is right here.
Yes, sir.
I'll go right to the pharmacy.
She should eat.
Something easy to digest.
Soup without too much fat, a boiled egg.
And you need rest too, Teresa, as much as she does.
If anything happens, send Milagros for me. I'll come right away.
Yes, Miguel.
Someone to whom I recently showed my glass beehive, with its movement like the main gear wheel of a clock-
Someone who saw the constant agitation of the honeycomb, the mysterious, maddened commotion of the nurse bees over the nests, the teeming bridges and stairways of wax, the invading spirals...
If you're his friend, you can talk to him whenever you want.
Just close your eyes and call him.
"It's me, Ana."
"It's me, Ana."
Quiet, Mirza. Mirza, quiet now.
- Good afternoon, madame.
- Yes, what is it?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was told about an apartment.
This is the right building, isn't it?
Who told you?
A friend of mine.
Well, a relation, actually.
The door.
I gather it's a small two-room apartment?
Think that's all I got to do? Some people think a concierge is a slave.
Not me. Would it be more convenient if I came back later?
You have to speak with Monsieur Zy.
I can only show the apartment.
I don't want to be a nuisance, but if it were at all possible, and if I might offer you some small compensation for your trouble, which is only reasonable.
What a lovely little dog you... you are.
You're Mirza, aren't you?
It's... It's a nice name, Mirza.
I'm sorry.
The previous tenant threw herself out of the window.
You can still see where she fell.
Look.
He's going to have to fix that.
She's not dead yet, though she might as well be.
She's in the Bretonneau Hospital.
What if she gets better?
Don't worry. She won't get better.
You're on to a good thing here.
Poor woman. What are the terms?
There's a fee for water.
The plumbing is new.
The tap was on the landing.
- And the toilet?
- Over there. Go around the corridor.
That's a view worth looking at!
How much is the premium?
The rent is 600 francs a month.
The premium I'm not sure about.
I think he wants 5,000 francs.
5,000? That's a lot of money.
It's not my business. You'll have to talk to Monsieur Zy. He lives down here.
I have to get back now.
All right, we're not deaf.
- We don't give to charity.
- It's about the apartment.
- What apartment?
- On the floor above.
Could I speak to Monsieur Zy?
Good afternoon.
- Have you seen the apartment?
- Yes. I wanted to discuss the terms.
5,000 premium, 600 a month.
That's a lot of money.
I couldn't pay more than 4,000.
- The concierge told you about the water.
- Yes, she did.
It's damned hard to find an apartment.
A student on the sixth floor gave me half that for a single room.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not criticising your apartment, but the toilet is a problem.
Suppose I got sick, which I don't often do, I can assure you, and I had to relieve myself in the night.
It wouldn't be very convenient.
On the other hand, I could pay you the 4,000 right away in cash.
It's not only a question of money, let's be clear about that, monsieur...
Trelkovsky.
Trelkovsky.
I won't exactly starve without your 5,000.
I'm renting the apartment because it's vacant. They don't grow on trees.
Of course. It's perfectly reasonable.
I understand your point.
Could I offer you a cigarette?
You want 5,000, fine. But if you got paid by cheque, you'd have to declare it.
Wouldn't you rather get 4,000 in cash?
I'd rather get 5,000 in cash.
It's perfectly natural. Anyway, the former tenant is not dead yet.
If she comes back, you won't even get 4,000. You get nothing.
Are you married? Excuse the question, but it's because of children.
This is a very quiet building.
My wife and I are getting on now.
I wouldn't say that, Monsieur Zy.
I know what I'm saying. My wife and I are getting on. We don't like noise.
You needn't worry.
I'm very quiet and I'm a bachelor.
Bachelors can be a problem, too.
If you want a place to entertain girls,
I'd rather take 2,000 and give it to someone more needy.
I quite agree, but I'm not that type.
I can't give you a definite answer while
Mademoiselle Choule is still alive.
But I like you. You seem to be a serious young man to me.
I want to visit Mademoiselle Choule.
Simone Choule?
- Are you a relative?
- I'm a friend.
Can I help you?
- Are you the head nurse?
- Yes.
Good. I was told at reception to see you first. It's about Mademoiselle Choule.
- Bed 18.
- May I see her?
She's not to be disturbed.
She was in a coma until yesterday.
Go ahead, but don't try to talk to her.
He said he'd come by Wednesday...
Are you a friend of hers?
Excuse me.
I can't believe it. I just can't believe it.
I was with her the night before.
No, two nights before.
She was in such good spirits.
Why would she do a thing like that?
To tell you the truth, I'm not close.
I hardly know her.
But believe me, I'm terribly upset about what's happened.
It's awful.
Simone?
Simone?
You do recognise me, don't you?
It's me. Stella.
Your friend Stella.
Don't you recognise me?
You'll have to leave now.
Your bag.
Is there any hope of saving her?
If we can save her, we save her.
Careful.
You mustn't give in to your grief.
If you like, we could have something to drink. I think it would help you.
There is a...
Here.
What would you like to drink?
I don't know.
I'll have a beer. No, a coffee.
- Coffee. And the lady?
- I don't want a coffee.
Have something strong.
It will pick you up.
I'll have a small glass of Beaujolais.
Small glass of Beaujolais and... a martini.
- No coffee?
- No, no. A martini.
I forgot. I have a phone call to make.
I'll be right back.
- Come here.
- All right, I'm coming.
I'll never understand suicide.
I have no argument against it but it's beyond my comprehension.
Did you ever discuss it with her?
Never.
I just can't believe it.
It's terrible. Terrible.
It's terrible.
Could it have been a disappointment in love? Something like that?
- Who with?
- I don't know. Some man.
You know she wasn't interested in men.
Yes, I know, but...
Women as sensitive as she was, she is, I mean, tend to have much more complicated relationships than they seem to.
Perhaps she will pull out of it anyway.
I doubt it.
Did you notice that she didn't even recognise me?
A tragedy.
Hey, man. Got any bread for an artist?
- I don't have any change.
- I don't care. I'll take what you got.
I've only got notes.
Don't look cheap in front of your girlfriend.
Not a word of thanks.
I don't like tramps. You shouldn't have given him anything.
- Would you like to have a drink?
- No. Thanks.
Right. Goodbye then.
- Goodbye.
- Hope to see you soon.
- What is it?
- Just came over from CNMA.
- Was it sent by Monsieur Lott?
- Right.
- That must be the Villa LeDuc.
- Yes, that's right.
Yes, that's the Villa LeDuc.
"Unmounted number 2601.
"Make a detailed copy of spire as indicated in the lower left-hand corner."
You have to do it by next Thursday.
I'm calling to ask if you have any news about Simone Choule.
- What department is she in?
- Surgery?
- Choule? With a C?
- That's right. Simone Choule.
- Are you a relative?
- No. I'm a friend.
The patient died at 4.20 p.m. Yesterday.
Thank you.
Yes... Goodbye.
- Morning, monsieur.
- Morning.
- Live opposite?
- Yes. I just moved in.
You rented the apartment of that girl that jumped out of the window?
Yes. Did you know her?
Sure I did. Came in every morning.
Always sat in the same place, right there where you are now.
A cup of chocolate and a roll.
Never coffee.
She'd say, "If I have a coffee
I can't sleep for two days."
- It's a question of habit.
- Would you like a chocolate?
A question of temperament, too.
A young girl like that killing herself.
I can't imagine why.
No reason at all, probably. A moment of depression and wham, it's all over.
Robert.
- Do you sell cigarettes?
- Yes. What would you like?
- Gauloises bleues, please.
- I'm out of Gauloises.
- What else?
- Gitanes and Marlboro.
Mademoiselle Choule smoked
Marlboro. Would you like a pack?
No. No, thank you.
Simone Choule, the Lord has taken thee to His bosom, just as the shepherd brings in his sheep at the close of day.
What could be more natural, of greater consolation?
Is it not our fondest hope that we shall one day rejoin the flock of holy ones?
Hope of eternal life, the true life, shorn of all worldly cares, face to face in eternal blessedness with Almighty God, who through His servant, our Lord Jesus Christ, died for us on the cross, who deigns to look down upon us poor mortal creatures, full of love, infinitely merciful, the sick, the suffering, the dying.
Yes, the dying.
The icy tomb.
Thou shalt return to the dust from whence thou came and only thy bones remain.
The worms shall consume thine eyes, thy lips, thy mouth.
They shall enter into thine ears, they shall enter into thy nostrils.
Thy body shall putrefy unto its innermost recesses and shall give off a noisome stench.
Yea, Christ has ascended into heaven and joined the host of angels on high.
But not for creatures like you, full of the basest vice, yearning only for carnal satisfaction.
How dare you pester me and mock at me to my very face?
What audacity! What are you doing here in my temple?
The graveyard is where you belong.
Thou shalt stink like some putrefied corpse lying on the wayside.
Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt never enter into my kingdom.
Four, three, two, one, zero! Our hero.
There he is!
Hey, Trelkovsky. The lucky lodger.
- Lucille Pampin from Nice.
- On the Riviera. Best blow job in Paris.
- Very pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
What, no more chairs? What a dump!
There is a table, right here.
Your fiancée can come sit on my knees.
It's against my principles.
Give me a hand.
Grab that end, will you?
Careful, huh?
- Put it right in the middle.
- That's it. Much nicer.
There's a bed here. Let's use that.
Move that table over.
Get the table out of there.
- Want me to do anything?
- Thank you.
- Let me finish that.
- Just get this salad finished.
- Have you met Viviane?
- Hello.
Hurry up. It weighs a ton.
- Set her down.
- Easy does it.
What the hell is this?
Is that one of yours?
Oh, no, cut it out.
He's got a heart of gold.
- How about you?
- No, I hadn't planned. I know.
He's got the heart of a chick.
You'd do it for a little bread.
I wouldn't. You could offer me a fortune, I still wouldn't dream of it.
You think there's anyone dumb enough to offer you a fortune?
She's talking about the principle, jerk.
You know what I think of your principles?
- What do you think?
- It's a lot of crap.
I tell you, I'd do it for nothing.
- Absolutely nothing.
- It takes all kinds.
Nobody wants me to, but I'd pay them to let me.
I saw one once.
Makes you want to throw up.
- Can we change the subject?
- And talk about women's lib?
Keep women's lib out of it.
Have you looked at those militants?
It's enough to turn you queer.
Look at that pig. He's actually pissing in the sink. How revolting!
Get off my back. It's not my fault there's no john in this crummy apartment.
- Monsieur?
- You're making a great deal of noise.
It's after one o'clock.
You're making a great deal of noise.
We're just having a quiet chat.
Quiet? I live upstairs and I can hear every word you're saying.
You've been dragging furniture around, stamping all over the place.
It's intolerable. Do you intend to carry on much longer?
Who is that asshole?
Look...
I'm terribly sorry I woke you.
I'll be more careful from now on.
You don't seem to give a damn about anyone else.
It's all very well to have a good time but some people have to work.
Tomorrow's Sunday. It's reasonable to have company on a Saturday evening.
No, monsieur. It's not reasonable to make such a racket, even on a Saturday evening!
We'll be more careful. Goodnight.
Soon you won't even be able to jerk off without him knocking on the door.
- Don't let him push you around.
- You should counter-attack.
- We've got to take revenge.
- Let's set the joint on fire.
- Throw scorpions down his chimney.
- Or crabs.
We'll drill a hole in the wall and force gas into it.
Make a hole in the floor.
- You're such a moron.
- He only thinks below the belt.
- He's throwing us out of the house.
- It's late.
- Meanie!
- Let's find someplace else.
- Let's go.
- Somebody pass me my coat.
- Be careful.
- Come on, on your feet.
Let's go, everybody.
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Come on, everyone.
Goodnight.
- Everybody out.
- One hell of a party.
Goodnight, my friend!
Don't make so much noise.
People are sleeping.
Good morning, Monsieur Zy.
Lovely day, isn't it?
I'm terribly embarrassed about last night.
I promise it won't happen again.
I hope not. You woke up both me and my wife. We couldn't get back to sleep.
What was the meaning of all that?
I thought I'd have a few friends over to celebrate my good fortune in having found this lovely apartment, as sort of a housewarming, without disturbing anyone.
And then, you know how it is.
With the best will in the world, not dreaming of disturbing anyone, you talk, you're having a good time.
Before you know it, you're making so much noise that...
I'm sorry. I can promise you it will never happen again.
I'm glad to hear that,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.
Because I was seriously thinking of taking steps.
Apartments are hard to come by, so it's worth keeping the one you have.
"Outraged neighbour shoots tipsy tenor for singing La Tosca at 3 a.m.
"Louis Marais, aged 39, bachelor, came home after one drink too many
"and proceeded to sing opera with his windows wide open.
"When a neighbour, Monsieur Pierrot, asked him to put off his warbling,
"Monsieur Marais responded with an air from Tosca sung on the hall landing.
"Pierrot emptied a gun into the poor tenor,
"who died before reaching hospital.
"The murderer is under arrest."
You there! Quiet down!
How much longer are you gonna keep up this racket?
Who is it?
It's me.
- What can I do for you?
- Did you register the complaint?
Complaint? Against whom?
Against me for causing a disturbance at night.
I never made any complaint.
Someone has registered a complaint.
It came this morning.
She's the one who makes noise all night.
- Who?
- That old woman. She's evil.
She's done all she could to make things difficult for us, just because the girl is disabled.
- You didn't register a complaint?
- Of course not.
It must have been her.
I asked downstairs.
They said it might have been you.
We go to bed early, not like her.
She can't sleep at night so she walks up and down her apartment, moves the furniture around.
She keeps me and my daughter awake.
Do you know what she did, monsieur?
Jammed a broom against my door.
I had to heave it open with all my strength.
I twisted a muscle in my shoulder.
She wants to have us thrown out.
She can't have you thrown out.
I never make any noise, monsieur, honestly.
Even if you did, they can't throw you out like that.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
God bless you.
God bless you, monsieur. Thank you.
- What about your neighbours?
- I'm getting used to them.
It's a question of habit. They have to get used to me too, you know.
If they keep bugging you, Simon and I know a few ways of dealing with them.
- Eh, Simon?
- We know some great tricks.
We could come around at night and yell up at you from the courtyard.
Hey, Trelkovsky, come out for a drink!
Get moving!
Or we could knock on the floor below after midnight.
And shout, "On your feet, shitface, we're off to the park for a blow job."
You know...
There is something odd going on in my building.
I see people in the toilets, on the other side of the courtyard...
What are you? A peeping Tom?
People together in the shithouse?
Like an orgy?
No, they just stand there for hours, you know?
Absolutely dead still.
- They're playing with themselves.
- Not at all.
They stand dead still. Can you play with yourself without moving?
- Drink?
- What are you having?
- Beer.
- Beer's fine.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just...
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
- Turn it down a little.
- Leave it alone. They're used to it.
But it's too loud even for us.
Try and get used to it.
Try to enjoy it while you can.
You can't do it at home.
Neighbour?
I hope so.
Sorry to bother you, monsieur.
I see you have company.
But I wonder, could you turn down the sound a little? My wife's sick.
She's sick, is she? What am I supposed to do? Stop living because of her?
If she's sick, why doesn't she go to a hospital?
I'll play my records when I want and as loud as I want.
I'm a bit hard of hearing but that's no reason to be deprived of my music.
And don't try anything funny.
I know the superintendent of police.
See? That's how you deal with them.
- What if his wife?
- So?
I don't moan to him when I don't feel well.
He won't come back either.
I can promise you that.
Just a moment, please.
Who is it?
Is this Simone Choule's apartment?
Yes.
It used to be. I'm the new tenant.
Has she moved, then?
Come in, please.
Don't stand there like that.
Nothing's happened to her, I hope.
- Please sit down, monsieur?
- Badar.
Pleased to meet you, Monsieur Badar.
My name's Trelkovsky.
I'm afraid there's been an unfortunate...
Did you know her well?
Did I know her?
She committed suicide.
She threw herself out of the window.
Would you like to see?
Why... Why would she do a thing like that?
No one seems to know.
Do you know Stella?
She doesn't know either.
No one knows why she did it.
I went back to the Egyptian department at the Louvre this morning.
I found a nice postcard and I sent it to her.
What irony!
Years of affection without daring to say anything.
I acted as though we were just friends each time I saw her, which wasn't very often,
I can tell you that.
It just isn't fair.
The day I summon up enough courage to tell her,
I find out...
I find out she's...
Why?
Why didn't I ever tell her?
She's gone without ever knowing it.
We're closing, Monsieur Trelkovsky.
Life isn't worth living any more.
- You mustn't...
- Six francs 60.
You mustn't think like that.
You're young, you'll forget.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Thank you.
I can promise you she didn't suffer.
And she didn't say anything?
- You're sure?
- Absolutely certain.
All right, all right.
It's my round, for Chrissakes!
Drinks for everyone.
Everyone except him.
Don't mind him. He's drunk. Drunk.
- What you've done for me...
- It's natural.
- It's not natural. It's not natural at all.
- It is natural.
There aren't many guys around like you. It's as simple as this.
You saved my life.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Cup of chocolate, Monsieur Trelkovsky?
Why not?
- Gauloises bleues, please.
- Yes.
I wanted some Gauloises.
I thought you said Marlboro.
I've run out of Gauloises.
Robert will be here soon.
I'll send him out for some.
Don't bother. I'll take the Marlboro.
Yes, I know!
I know I'm making a noise.
You should have knocked before when the thieves were here.
Perhaps they did knock before.
This can't go on any longer.
You kept everyone awake again.
All the neighbours are complaining.
Are you talking about last night?
Of course I am.
You made a fiendish racket.
I made it clear you wouldn't stay for long if you behave like that.
I shall be forced to take steps.
I've been robbed, Monsieur Zy.
I'm on my way to the police station.
What do you mean?
My house is a respectable place.
- If you're trying to get out of this...
- It's true.
My television is gone, my camera, one of my suitcases.
I see.
Well, I'm very sorry for you, but why are you going to the police?
To tell them what happened.
Now look, Monsieur Trelkovsky.
- This is an honest house.
- There's no question...
Let me finish. You know how careful
I am in choosing my tenants.
I let you have the apartment because you seemed honest.
Otherwise if you'd offered me a million francs I'd have refused.
If you go to the police, they'll come round asking all sorts of questions, useless questions.
All that can have a disastrous effect on our reputation here.
- I'm saying this for your sake, too.
- For my sake? What have I done?
Once anyone gets involved with the police, they're looked on with suspicion, especially if they're not French.
But I'm a French citizen.
I know you've done nothing wrong, but others won't know that.
They'll suspect you of God knows what.
I know what I'm talking about.
I know the superintendent of police.
I'll have a word with him about this.
He'll know what to do.
Oh... and by the way...
The former tenant always wore slippers after ten o'clock.
It was much more comfortable for her.
And for the neighbours.
- A pack of Marlboro.
- Gimme a pack of Gauloises.
A pack of Marlboro, please.
There she was. She was in a ward...
- A pack of Gauloises.
- One franc 60.
See you next week.
Hello. How are you?
Very well. I just came in for cigarettes.
Come and join us. These are my friends.
- May I?
- Of course.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We were just talking about Simone.
- Simone?
- Simone Choule.
This is the guy I told you about, the one I met at the hospital.
We were the last to see her alive.
Stella told us
Simone didn't seem to know her.
- I don't think she did.
- And you?
- Me?
- She didn't recognise you either?
It's hard to say. I couldn't be sure one way or the other.
Maybe she was trying to say something when she screamed like that.
Anyway, that's the impression I get when I think back on it.
She was looking at you when she let out that cry.
- You think so?
- You know...
I still have some things of hers at home. It's depressing.
- What have you got of hers?
- Some books, a couple of records.
There's one of Simone's books.
- I haven't read it.
- Nor have I.
I'm not interested in Egyptology.
She left it behind one evening.
You can have it if you like.
Oh, you're very kind.
I would love to read it.
It's a magnificent place you've got here.
Better than where I live.
If you don't mind me asking, is the rent very high?
I don't pay for it.
It belongs to my brother.
He's gone off to Peru for a few months, a year, travelling.
Do you have trouble with your neighbours?
- What sort of trouble?
- You know...
These days, relationships with neighbours can get quite complicated.
You know, little things that get blown up out of all proportion.
- You know what I mean?
- No.
No, I don't.
I mind my own business.
So do I. It's the best way.
If you like, I'll take you home after.
Shall we go back to your place?
My place?
OK?
Sure, fine.
Only my place is a bit...
It's a bit difficult.
In fact, it's impossible.
Why? Have you got a girlfriend?
Not exactly.
It's just that I've been repainting and the place is in chaos.
Chaos.
We could still spend a couple of hours there.
On top of that, my uncle is just up from the country, staying a few days.
How about your place?
Take off your coat.
I'll be right back.
I'd love something to drink.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Why don't you take your tie off?
You look like you're choking to death.
I found a tooth in my apartment.
It was in a hole.
A tooth?
In a hole?
Yeah.
A hole in the wall.
Wrapped in cotton wool.
So? No need to pull such a long face over a tooth.
A bit weird though, isn't it?
Not really. When I was young, we did it all the time.
Whenever one of my teeth fell out
I used to hide it.
My mother said it would turn into a coin.
Coin.
Oh, God.
- Stella, I was wondering...
- Yeah?
A tooth...
A tooth is a part of ourselves, isn't it?
Like a... bit of our personality.
I don't know what you mean.
I remember in the newspaper, a man lost his arm in an accident and wanted to have it buried.
He wanted to do what?
- Have it buried in the cemetery.
- He must have been nuts.
The authorities refused. The arm was cremated and that was that.
Where did this happen? In France?
I wonder if they refused to give him the ashes and if so, by what right?
Haven't you got anything more cheerful to talk about?
All right, that'll do.
Don't worry.
Tell me...
At what precise moment...
...does an individual stop being who he thinks he is?
You know, I don't like complications.
Cut off my arm.
I say, "Me and my arm."
You cut off my other arm.
I say, "Me and my two arms."
You... take out...
...take out my stomach, my kidneys, assuming that were possible...
And I say, "Me and my intestines."
Follow me?
And now, if you cut off my head...
...would I say, "Me and my head" or "Me and my body"?
What right has my head to call itself me?
What right?
Oh, God.
Monsieur Trelkovsky?
Stay. Stay, Mirza, stay.
You were out all night, huh?
Yes, I...
I had to stay with my uncle.
He isn't well.
I'll tell Madame Dioz you're back.
Madame Dioz? Who's Madame Dioz?
This isn't for me.
Look.
"Best wishes from the Louvre.
"Georges Badar."
I'd like to have a word with you, monsieur.
Please come in, madame.
I am Madame Dioz.
- I'm very pleased to meet you.
- This is why I'm here. Please read it.
It is a petition against the unspeakable Madame Gaderian.
She's gone too far this time, and we've got to do something about it.
Look. Even Monsieur Zy has signed. There.
Who is Madame Gaderian?
I don't know her.
You don't know her? Who do you think makes all that dreadful noise?
It is her, my dear young man.
She does her washing up in the middle of the night and she whistles at the same time.
- Does a civilised person do that?
- I suppose not.
Go on, then. Sign.
It's simply a question of solidarity.
She's making life impossible for... for the other tenants.
Is she the one who lives with a disabled daughter?
Disabled? No.
She has a boy, a horrible, noisy brat who's always playing skittles or God knows what in the corridor.
Are you sure? Are you absolutely certain she doesn't have a daughter?
I don't know what goes on in their lair.
Ask the concierge.
I'm sorry, I'm not signing any petition.
This woman has never bothered me.
I've never seen her or even heard of her.
What apartment does she live in?
I shall make a note of your attitude.
I see what this is. Everyone for himself and never mind anyone else.
- Not at all.
- I know your type exactly, like that man opposite, up until he was struck down with paralysis.
Then his neighbours let him stew in his own juice.
By all means, do whatever you think best.
But I warn you, don't come whining to me later.
Bastards.
What do you want me to do?
Drop dead?
My wife is always...
It's for me.
It's no use playing innocent.
I've heard a good deal about you,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.
You specialise in breaches of the peace at night.
I'm quite amazed, Inspector.
No one has said anything to me.
I'm not in the habit of making noise.
I have few friends and never entertain.
I'm not interested in your stories.
I have other things to do.
I keep receiving complaints and it's my duty to maintain law and order.
So I say it once and for all, stop whatever it is you're doing at night.
Trelkovsky. Is that a Russian name?
Polish.
- So you're not French?
- I'm a French citizen.
Let me see your identity card.
It's in a very poor state.
You haven't registered your change of address.
15 rue Sedan, where is this?
I'm terribly sorry, I'll do it at once.
You'll be well advised to.
Right. This time I shall close my eyes to the whole business.
Make sure I don't hear about you again.
I won't have you disturbing the peace.
Thank you very much, Inspector.
Goodbye.
Good afternoon, madame.
I would like to know who registered a complaint against me.
Do you know who it was?
If you didn't make so much noise there wouldn't be any complaints.
Was there a petition?
Was it that woman that came to see me the other day? Madame Dioz?
You only have yourself to blame.
Did you sign it?
That's it. She's won.
They've all signed it.
All except you, monsieur.
Thank you. You're a good person.
I don't like to get involved.
Nonsense. You're a good person.
I can see it in your eyes.
I got even with them. The concierge, too.
She's as bad as all of them.
I paid them back, all right.
They gave me the idea.
Do you know what I did?
I did it. On the staircase, in front of everyone's door.
It's their own fault.
They gave me the idea.
I didn't do it by your door.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
- How long ago?
- Just now.
I would love to see their faces when they find out.
- It serves them right, all of them.
- They'll say I did it.
Goodnight, monsieur. Sleep well.
Hey, look.
They'll drive me to suicide.
All right. I'll show them.
Gorgeous shoes, my dear.
So pretty. Where in the world did you find them?
Oh, it was... I don't know...
80 francs, you're kidding.
Supermarket, yes.
She's not as young as she thinks she is.
Beautiful, beautiful.
Adorable.
A goddess, divine.
Divine.
I think I'm pregnant.
Monsters!
Monsters!
They'll never turn me into Simone Choule. Never!
Monsieur Trelkovsky.
Do you remember the conditions on which I let you move in?
I do, Monsieur Zy.
May I know what you're referring to?
- I'm referring to women.
- Oh, yes, of course.
Then, why do you bring them here?
What? I never brought any women here.
I know you did. You had a woman in your room. You can't deny it.
I'll turn a blind eye to it this time.
But this is the last time.
I hope that's clear.
Good morning, Monsieur Trelkovsky.
Bring me a coffee.
- You don't want a chocolate?
- No, I want a coffee.
- You always have a chocolate.
- You never ask me what I want.
Today I'm telling you, I'd like a coffee.
I'm sorry, but...
The problem is, you see...
The machine's broken down.
- You won't have a chocolate?
- No! Why should I?
Nothing to get sore about.
I'll have... a glass of red wine.
I suppose you're out of Gauloises.
- That's right. We've only got Marlboros.
- You can keep them.
I know just what you're up to.
A gang of murderers!
No good looking at me like that.
I know exactly what your little scheme is.
- What's the matter?
- My boat.
- Which one?
- The red one.
Now, don't cry. What's your name?
Patrick.
And you've lost your boat, the red one?
OK, I'll get it back for you.
Filthy little brat.
It's him! He's there!
God! What's that?
I'll fight.
I'll fight to the bitter end.
Who is it?
It's me, Trelkovsky.
Were you sleeping?
What's the matter?
Sorry to bother you at this hour of the morning.
Would you mind if I stayed here for a while?
You're strange.
You must tell me, then.
I wouldn't mind, really.
No, of course you can stay.
Look, you're hurt.
It's nothing, really.
- But it's filthy.
- That's nothing.
Wait. I think I've got some... some things here.
How did you do that?
It's them.
Who?
They're trying to kill me.
They'll drive me to suicide.
What are you talking about?
Who's trying to kill you?
Stella, I've been lying to you.
I'm living in her apartment.
Whose apartment?
Simone's.
I've rented Simone Choule's apartment.
- How did you rent it?
- She's dead because of the neighbours.
It was a plot.
- Plot against Simone? You're insane.
- I'm not insane. Listen.
They forced her to commit suicide.
I can prove it.
And they're trying to do the same thing to me.
Everything's ready.
They worked it all out, every detail.
Do you know what they've been doing to me?
It's so appalling, so incredible that I can hardly tell you.
It's true, I swear it.
Tell me. Tell me, I'm listening.
They've been trying to turn me into Simone Choule.
There now. I'm your friend.
- They're trying...
- I'll help you. Come now.
- To turn me...
- You're exhausted.
...into Simone Choule.
I'll leave Paris in a couple of days.
They'll never find me.
You're right, yes.
That's the best thing to do.
You're the only one I can trust.
It's me, Stella.
Don't be frightened.
You do recognise me, don't you?
Sorry.
I was having a nightmare.
I must get to work now. I'm late.
I'll be back around eight.
I left your breakfast ready.
- I love you.
- And I love you.
I even went out and bought you some croissants.
Please stay. Don't leave me alone.
I'm late. If you want to go out, just leave the keys under the mat.
I'll have another pair made tomorrow.
We'll each have our own set then.
- Please don't go.
- Don't be naughty now.
You're to be good and stay here.
There's everything you need. If you like, you can go out and get some fresh air.
I'll bring food back and we'll eat in or go out to a restaurant if you like.
We'll see how you feel.
See you tonight, then.
Is anyone there?
Is anyone there?
Filthy bitch.
They're all in it together.
They're all in it together!
They're all in it...
They're all in it together!
- Stop here. Stop.
- Hey, what's wrong?
Nothing. I'm getting out.
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.
Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you very much.
Have you got any idea where I can buy a gun? I'll pay good money.
Get out of here, you little punk.
- He wants to buy a gun, this bugger.
- What?
I'll tell the cops, you little shit.
I told you not to drive so fast.
Now look what's happened.
Monsieur, are you hurt?
People who can't drive should take taxis.
How dare you? My wife hasn't had an accident in 25 years.
He's right. The guy walked right under the wheels. I saw it all.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
Murderers! Murderers!
Believe me, my wife and I are very upset about what's happened.
Stand back. On the kerb.
- Officer, this is how it happened...
- Your ID, please. Yours too, monsieur.
You're very lucky.
Only a few scratches.
Nothing broken.
But you should have an X-ray.
It's nothing serious.
It's a mild case of delirium tremens.
These people have made a statement and offered to drive him home.
Or should I call an ambulance?
If the gentleman can manage, it's fine.
We'll be glad to give this poor man a lift home, of course.
We'll take you home, huh?
That is preposterous. No, please!
They were trying to kill me. They were playing football with a human head.
I'll give him a shot to calm him down.
No injection. I don't want an injection.
I don't want...
They tried... They tried to kill me.
Mirza, quiet down.
Good evening, madame. This gentleman has had a slight accident.
- Nothing serious.
- What did he do now?
We'd better get him up to his apartment.
How did it happen?
He sort of jumped out in front of the car.
Luckily my wife has very good reflexes.
What's going on here?
It's him again.
Oh, you bastard!
Stay. Stay, Mirza, stay.
- What's that?
- Down in the courtyard.
We'd better call an ambulance.
Go get one, quick.
You shouldn't move.
I swear I'm not Simone Choule.
Quick, get him a blanket.
- Murderer!
- Another suicide! It's unbelievable.
Look how he's dressed.
He must be insane.
And we just finished repairing the roof.
I knew there was something wrong with him the first time I saw him.
Oh, God, Monsieur Trelkovsky.
Be reasonable, wait for the ambulance.
You gang of killers!
I'll show you some blood.
You wanted a clean death, didn't you?
- Be reasonable.
- It's going to be dirty.
Unforgettable.
It was better last time, wasn't it?
Well, I'm not Simone Choule.
I'm Trelkovsky.
Trelkovsky.
- All right, all right. What's goin' on?
- A tenant jumped out of the window.
- Again? You're getting them wholesale.
- Where is he now?
He's gone back up to his apartment.
I think he had some kind of a brainstorm.
- He's gonna jump again!
- He's not gonna do it again?
Take it easy. Don't move.
We'll come up and get you.
Be reasonable now.
Oh, God, no.
Monsieur Trelkovsky, don't do anything silly!
Are you a friend of hers?
I'm sorry.
What on earth could have happened?
Why would she do a thing like that?
To tell you the truth,
I'm not a friend of hers at all.
I hardly know her, actually, but...
Simone...
Simone...
You do recognise me, don't you?
It's me. Stella.
Your friend Stella.
Don't you recognise me?
ENGLISH
Minus five, minus four... three, two, one.
Ignition.
We have separation.
What'll she do?
Stardust's mission is to explore the stars and planets of this galaxy and beyond.
I know that. I mean how fast will she go?
Stardust should definitely travel faster than light, which, as you all know, is 186,283.4 miles per second.
Wow! That's really pouring the coal to it!
We won't be using coal, Senator Milburn.
Stardust will actually collect atoms while in flight, ionising the medium ahead of the craft and guiding the ions into the intake area here.
This can be accomplished by the use of intense magnetic fields.
In just four and a half years, the craft could reach our nearest star, Alpha Centauri.
Aren't such speeds supposed to turn back the clock or develop a time warp?
This flight will put Einstein's
Theory of Relativity to the test.
The crew won't be aware of time passing.
- Did you say "crew"?
The ship is designed for two crewmen.
- You can stop right there, Doctor.
You intend to put fine young American men into that untried contraption and shoot 'em out into some never-never land?
That's oversimplifying it, but yes.
- Oh, no, you're not.
Not while I'm chairman of the Finance Ways and Means Committee of this project.
Not with the elections coming up.
- We have women in the space programme.
Women? No, sir.
Come up with another brainstorm, Doctor, or that baby's never gonna get out of this room.
Trimble here.
- What are you doing?
Transcendental meditation, sir.
- I'm taking you off that project.
You're going onto Humanoids.
- Human...?
Humanoids?
- I want a robot that walks, talks, the works!
Yes, sir!
It's a method of transportation known as an airplane.
Man uses it to fly through the air.
This is a woman. I am a man. You are modelled after me. She is the opposite sex.
We named him Hermes after the Greek god of speed.
We've managed to simulate an ordinary, average human body.
Not only does Hermes look human, but he has human reflexes and responses to a given situation.
Such as.
How do you feel, Hermes?
- (BLEEPS) Fine, thank you.
He talks, he reacts to shapes and stimuli.
He'll relay information on human anatomical compensation to interstellar flight almost as well as man.
Please, gentlemen, step up and say hello!
Well, Senator, we did it.
(TV) This spacecraft will travel farther and
faster than anything yet conceived by man. 
Stardust is designed and equipped
for exploration on distant planets. 
We're informed by Ground Control
that all systems are green,
but we're on hold
due to a technical problem. 
Hermes, the President is waiting.
What's holding things up?
I've got important guests out there.
Hermes doesn't want to go. He's afraid.
- Afraid? What's he afraid of?
That he won't ever come back.
It's possible. Hermes has thought the problem through.
Walter's asking about the delay.
Tell him it's a technical problem we're taking care of.
Zimmerman, I approved this contraption.
My committee chairmanship is riding on it.
You blow it and your budget next year won't be enough to build a paper plane!
Smedley, get Trimble to try and talk some sense into it.
Snap it up! There's a storm front coming in!
- Yes, sir.
Hermes, Hermes, I wanna talk to you.
Close the hatch.
What is this about you not wanting to go?
I'm afraid I'm never coming back.
- Of course you are.
What a silly thing to say.
Get into your nice white space suit.
Dr Zimmerman thinks it'll be good publicity.
You've put me in an embarrassing position.
What are people gonna think if we have to scrub this mission because you're afraid?
Come on, just put this thing on.
What's this?
Hermes!
Well, 30 years is 30 years, I suppose.
We'll forget the suit. Hermes, we've spent a lot of time and money on this mission...
Is that you, Hermes?
- No, it's Tom Trimble.
Get out of the picture, Trimble, you look awful. Where Hermes?
He's here. I think he's hurt, broken.
You've got to get us down!
Impossible, Trimble. We can't abort this mission now. Make yourself comfortable.
For 30 years?!
- Oh, it won't seem that long to you.
10 at the outside.
- I have agoraphobia and it's getting worse!
Relax or we can't get true readings on you.
Something else, Trimble.
When you get back, there'll be a surprise in your pay envelope. How's that sound?
Like a posthumous award!
- Ahem. Well, I have to go.
You won't have much to report until you reach star Vega, but keep in touch.
But...
Hermes, do something!
We've got to get this thing down!
Do what you were programmed to do.
I'm sorry. Your pulse staticizer probably got jammed when you bumped your head.
Don't worry, it's nothing that a soldering iron and a screwdriver can't fix.
I gotta get this thing into orbit.
Oh, no!
Oh, boy, the power's failing.
No... it's the sun rising and setting!
I gotta slow this thing down.
We'd best spend the night here, then get an early start for Camelot in the morning.
What was that?!
It's after us!
Shh!
Why would it stick its tongue out at us?
What's that?
Now you've done it! Fly for your life!
Oh, please, take me instead!
No contest! But, lady, you wouldn't believe what I've been through so... Where am I?
Bodney-on-Trent, Langdale Walk,
Bennington Green, Cornwall, England the year of our Lord 508... monster.
508! It really works!
You really can turn back the clock!
Here.
Albert Einstein, you really knew your stuff!
What is it you're after?
I have to figure a way to get back into orbit, rewind the clock and get back to the Cape.
Mm. Well, we must be going now.
Where?
- Camelot. It's four leagues... monster.
Why do you keep calling me monster?
- You have no face and no ears.
If I can get this off,
I'll show you what I look like inside.
Oh, I'm not that curious to look inside you.
Please, can we go now?
Wait! Who's in charge here?
I suppose I am. Mum died of the plague three years past.
And this is Father. Come on.
What's that she's consorting with?
- 'Tis too big for a troll.
Yet it's plainly not aggressive.
Are you certain you want to go to the castle?
They aren't always friendly to mons...
Strangers.
- I gotta get outta here.
Maybe in Camelot I can find a person who doesn't think I'm from outer space.
And where do you come from?
- Hey, easy with the stick!
I friend!
- Aiding fugitives is punishable by death.
I wasn't aiding anybody...
- You are my prisoner! Do you contest that?
No. Discretion is the better part of valour.
Very good. I must tell that to the King.
Lead on, prisoner, to Camelot!
Go on with your story.
- Well...
.. Sir Mordred wanted Father's land, but Father refused to give it up.
He believes that every freeman should own the land he works, isn't that right, Father?
What is that? They keep doing that.
They think you're a goblin.
Goblins come out in the evening.
Do you still think I'm a goblin?
- Heaven forbid.
I never thought it for an instant.
Goblins don't fly.
When did your father become a goose?
A gander!
- I don't believe it!
Oh, it's quite true.
- No, I mean the castle. That's Camelot?
It is.
- King Arthur's Camelot?
Come on.
When I returned from Haymarket, the gander was in Father's chair eating crumbs off the table.
So you figured it was your old man transformed by some evil spell.
What else could it be? Father was nowhere to be seen and the door was locked.
If only I could see Merlin.
I know he could make Father himself again.
Merlin? The magician?
- Yes.
How would the likes of you know Merlin?
- Oh, just by reputation.
Now, most gracious King Arthur,
I shall transform this pink-eyed white rat into vintage red wine.
If I were to turn you to stone, Sir Gawain, possibly I might continue uninterrupted.
Rattray... vanishay!
Et coldon hideway!
Howmay!
By my soul! That's wine! Wine!
And that concludes my dazzling display of black magic for this evening. Your servant.
Fear not, I have it subdued.
Your Majesty.
- Mordred, what have you in tow this time?
King Arthur, after the ceremony, I...
Your Majesty, with intention to rob, this creature and five like it fell upon me in the forest with firebrands and lances!
I despatched the others and spared this one as a curio for Your Majesty.
The head resembles a bug and I've not seen tentacles like that on a man creature before.
It's this space suit, Your Majesty.
In sand shoes, slacks and a blazer...
What are your plans for it? It's not large enough for a beast of burden.
I was thinking more along the lines of a burning.
Excellent suggestion, Mordred!
With Your Majesty's approval,
I could do something out of the ordinary with this creature.
What do you mean, burning?
Burn who? For what?
Burning is a fit punishment for the offence.
- Very well, then. A burning early tomorrow.
(PEOPLE) Burn him!
- When do I get my turn to bat? Wait, wait!
Wait! Let him speak.
I would know something of your plan.
- I could sell this better without this helmet.
Do you have a wrench around here?
- Wench? Wench?
We've several wenches. We don't usually make them available to captive... things.
However... Peg! Tend to its needs!
Within reason!
I think if you could get a head lock around here and twist...
Don't worry, you won't feel a...
That face!
Hi.
Er... you wanted to hear about my plan.
I suppose I should start with a little history or, in your case, a little future.
In... 1492, a man named Christopher Columbus is going to discover America.
America is another continent approximately 3,000 miles from here.
Columbus's ships will be named the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.
A lot of people think that Leif Ericson got there first. I don't know.
All I know is that all the banks are closed on Columbus Day, not Ericson Day.
Ericson Day!
So we jump a couple of hundred years...
So when Stardust blasted off prematurely,
I was trapped inside.
You recall my explanation of the law of gravity and how that theory is applied to orbiting objects.
Well, Stardust...
- Yes, yes, we all recall Madame Curie...
.. and Fulton's steamboat... and that imbecile who flew kites in the rain!
Just think what we could do with the likes of them today if they were not just the creation of your disordered BRAIN!
Those are the straight goods. It happened just the way I told you or, at least, it will!
And you seriously expect us to believe that you were alive 1,400 years from now?
Then why aren't you 1,400 years old?
- Well, that's a little difficult to explain.
With your permission, may I suggest we put an end to this travesty?
Agreed. Take him away.
- Wait a minute!
I can tell you how the Crusades come out!
Mordred tries to take over your kingdom!
Maybe with a little historical licence,
I can help you out, King!
I'm very good with a screwdriver!
Just listen...
Food for Sir Mordred's latest prisoner!
Sandi... over here.
Thing... I hardly recognised you without your head on!
Stop with that "thing" thing. This is getting serious. I'm gonna be burned at the stake.
Can you believe that?
Me, burned at the stake?
I heard. But, see, I've brought you something.
Clarence's hammer - to free you from your chains.
You did all this for me?
- Well, you've harmed no one.
You should be set free to return to your natural habitat.
You mean the USA.
- Yeah, mm.
Or the sky. Wherever you like it best.
When you get an idea in your head, you don't let go. Look at me closely.
Do I look like a monster to you?
Not any more, but you did when you came out of your shell breathing smoke.
No, that was steam. It was as hot as an oven in the capsule when I re-entered.
How does an ordinary man live in an oven?
This is a special suit. It resists heat.
Its even got its own temperature control - like a built-in air-conditioning system.
Now, between that and the asbestos mater...
Asbestos material!
I need a match.
Didn't that hurt?
- No, no. Here, hold that candle.
And that doesn't either!
I must go now.
- No reason to be afraid. I'll be safe.
This material is a mixture of a silicate of calcium and magnesium.
It doesn't conduct heat!
Now do you understand?
Of course.
No, Sandi, I'm no different from you or anybody... Ow!
What was that?
- Next room.
The man's got growing pains.
It can't last for long.
Are you all right?
Who... Who asks such a stupid question?
Tom Trimble. I'm Sir Mordred's prisoner.
- Satan himself.
He wants me to confess I killed one of his deer.
If I confess to his charge...
.. I must forfeit all my properties to him.
It is my only legacy to my beloved daughter Alisande.
Are you Sandi's father?
- You... You know my daughter?
Yes, yes!
- Poor child must think me dead.
Actually she thinks you're a goose.
- A goose? Her own father?
She must get word to our sovereign.
- Don't worry.
After I'm burned,
I'll tell the whole story to King Arthur.
Would it not show more foresight to tell him BEFORE the burning?
I had troubling dreams when I did sleep, Gawain.
Tell me, was it the Wright brothers who discovered radio?
I think not, Your Highness. That was.. er...
That was Babe Ruth.
And Uncle Milty was... will be the first man to fly, correct?
I believe he invents the horseless carriage, but I dozed off through that period.
He could be trained to be a court jester.
He tells the best lies we've ever heard.
True.
- Better even than Sir Mordred's.
How's that, Sir Gawain?
- When I say better, I mean different.
You tell the most excellent lies, Sir Mordred.
Of course you do!
Executioners, by His Majesty's gracious command, bring in the creature!
Look at the size of him!
- He's eaten a hearty last meal.
Clarence, could you reach inside my leg there?
Hold that till I get back.
There's some very good articles in it.
It is most brave. Isn't it, Father?
Er, King Arthur, could I please have a word with you after the burning?
After the burning?
Well, if he feels up to it, I see no harm.
Make sure it is bound securely.
(THE SUIT WHINES
LIKE A DEFLATING BALLOON)
It would appear it's suddenly wasting away.
Proceed while there's something left to burn.
Start the burning!
By my...!
Mordred, you're rarely at a loss for words.
What say'st thou?
Plainly he comes from hardy stock,
Your Majesty.
Merlin, fan the flames!
Merlin.
Do you think this creature has unholy powers?
Impossible!
I mean, Your Majesty, my liege,
I may have underestimated his capacities.
I'd rather he was with us than against us.
- We've already abused that option.
I can't have it roaming the halls of Camelot.
Mordred, it was all your doing.
And I should be the thing's undoing.
There is nothing to fear!
We have yet to see how this creature resists cold steel! Page!
Go inside and fetch my sword.
- Me?!
Thou jests!
- Thou art on thin ice! I bid thee obey!
You're in trouble. Mordred's looking for you.
- I must find the monster and help him.
He cannot defend himself against weapons, that we have seen.
What concern is that of yours?
- Clarence, perhaps he isn't a monster.
Did you see that?
With these eyes, but my heart refuses to accept it.
Come... we must help it escape.
Come on, Father.
Sandi, I can explain everything! I saw...
- There's no time!
Sir Mordred threatens to run you through!
- Clarence, lend a hand here.
(MORDRED) Page, I would have my sword!
- Is there a back door? A laundry chute?
No, and only the King can order the drawbridge lowered.
(MORDRED) I'll butcher that creature like a hung beef!
It's locked!
Surely you can defend yourself in some way!
Do you bite?
We have the finest selection of swords in the country here. Try one.
Isn't that King's Arthur's sword?
Oh, I knew it! Your heart is pure.
There's no time for that now. You'd better leave before Mordred gets here.
I couldn't bear to watch anyway.
Clarence, I don't know how to fight!
I must deliver Sir Mordred his sword.
If he thought I'd befriended thee...
- Listen, you have to help me!
Impossible! Mordred would boil me in oil!
- He'll never know!
I'm a lowly page, but I'll do what I can.
- Great! Now, which way is north?
Got a hammer?
- Only in the blacksmith's shop.
Anything'll do.
I'm gonna magnetise the sword.
"Magetise" it...?
- A solid blow will rearrange its molecules.
Hurry up, come on!
What delays thee, page? I'll skewer thee!
He wenteth that way.
It's taken refuse in the Great Hall.
- Where it will see its last moments.
Ahh!
It has taken on rust.
I have been putting my lance to use.
Mordred, please,
I have a knack for this sort of thing.
Are you going to be long?
You're holding up the midday meal.
I beg your indulgence, sire...
.. but my sword and I seem to be at odds.
He seems quite attached to it.
I hate to impose on you, Your Majesty, but would you be so kind?
I'll fillet thee like a flounder!
May I remind you, Mordred, that you are a knight of the Round Table?
Ohhh!
If you'd be so kind.
- Is that fair?
A good knight must use his own judgement.
- Sir Mordred is one of our own.
Release it quickly!
- I find it impossible to oblige you.
It is metal it attracts.
Touch not metal with the blade.
- His head be not of metal!
Guards, stay fast!
Now, Mordred, put an end to it!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Oh, dear, what a pity.
Sir Lancelot! Is he here?
- He's taken leave.
Something about rescuing a maiden.
- I heard he was into that.
Sir BrandeI.
Ah... here's Sir Galahad.
- Sir Galahad.
I can't wait to get home and tell the folks about this.
I've gotta get back to the 20th century.
- You keep saying that.
How can one go back to the 20th century when we're in the 6th?
I'll figure it out.
- Tell me, Tom, please.
I promise not to let it go past this room.
Where exactly do you come from?
Do you remember when I told you about Columbus...
Wait, wait, wait. I can't go into that again.
Bugs, the jitter, Beatles, the throw rocks...
- No, no, play rock.
You'll understand better when I show you Stardust.
Ah, Sir Mordred.
King... No, never mind.
What is it?
I don't like to get mixed up in office politics, but sources tell me Mordred has a sideline.
Sideline?
- He's moonlighting.
He has a guy on the rack, trying to force him to confess to poaching so that Mordred can rip off his land.
What?! That's a serious charge against a knight. I trust you have proof.
Oh, I do. Follow me.
- Wait!
A king does not follow a captive, however weird he may be.
Sorry, King, go ahead.
Downstairs and to your left, King.
Sir Mordred put him down here.
Poor guy's just skin and bones.
It appears he's wasted away to nothing.
- If indeed he ever was here.
Mordred, I'm told you're involved in a... what?
Land grab.
- Wresting property from free men.
A blatant lie, Your Majesty!
My honour had been impugned.
I demand satisfaction on the field!
- Again?!
He has that right, though I've lost some good knights that way.
Maybe I made a mistake.
Maybe he said Moorhead, not Mordred.
A joust to the death!
- You wouldn't change that to chess?
Chess? To the death?
- I demand satisfaction!
Oh, dear. Tut tut tut. So be it.
It shall be decided tomorrow.
I'll tell you one thing! No more nice guy me!
- I think you can safely say that.
(WHISPERS) Clarence, are you alone?
- Go away.
My hours are numbered as it is.
I've got a proposition for you.
This is yours to keep if you'll help me get outta here.
If you don't fight Sir Mordred, you'll be banished from England for ever.
That still beats a sharp stick in the chest.
What do you say?
There's a rope by the old chapel.
I'll be there at...
What's that?
- 9 o'clock.
OK.
What news upon my worthy opponent?
- We've searched the castle. He has fled.
Obviously he's cast his spell on the guards and fled, which gives little satisfaction to me!
If he has not made an appearance soon, we'll consider him vanquished.
And with it, I trust, his heinous charges against Sir Mordred, my liege.
Hello, what's this?
Oh, Father, he looks so handsome!
All in white with his little red, white and blue flag.
We must give him something to take into battle and his world beyond.
You shall not have your victory without bloodletting after all.
My pleasure! Let's get on with it!
Oh, Thomas, it would make me most proud if you'd carry something of mine into battle.
Please, wear this.
Oh, it's from Father, too.
- (BLEEPS) Thank you.
Is it over yet?
- Not yet.
But the maid Alisande is talking to your twin brother.
He's not my brother. Sandi?
- Yes.
He's a humanoid, a robot.
When we reset his staticizer,
I programmed him to joust for me.
Well, if thou say so.
Thomas...
.. I wouldn't dare speak like this
if I ever had to face you again. 
But since you're going to be killed, I see no harm in revealing my feelings for you.
Clarence, I think she likes me!
- We really have no time for this.
If one of Sir Mordred's servants found us here, I dare not contemplate his wrath.
OK.
All right, Hermes, that's enough.
Put her down and get on with the joust.
He's programmed to react, but this is sheer insubordination.
Hermes, put the girl down and go on with the joust. That's an order.
(BLEEPS) You feel soft.
I feel soft?
That's it? That's all you have to say?
- (BLEEPS) Later.
There is no later. I can turn you off as fast as she can turn you on!
Get what thou seeks and let us vacate these chambers.
You're right.
Giddy-up.
Should somebody should tell him his arm's missing?
I cannot intercede. I made the rule.
How's it going?
Ah, look at that.
Hermes, turn around and do it again.
You just have to keep going till you can't go any longer.
How's Hermes doing?
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
He seems to have lost his head.
- Hermes is cool.
Oh, you mean REALLY lost his head!
I'm sorry, Hermes, but this is to save England.
I have seen similar phenomena in chickens, My Lord.
This is England, sire.
Sir Mordred.
Can you not put an end to this?
It has long ceased to be sport.
As Your Majesty knows, tradition demands he must yield or die!
Well, at least it's out of its misery. Come.
The contest is over down there.
- How's Hermes?
Done for.
- Maybe I can put him together again.
All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't do that.
Look at this! This is it! Just wait till King
Arthur gets a load of this! C'mon, let's go!
Pity. I was becoming rather attached to it, whatever it was.
It will no longer be a source of torment.
I've despatched it from our midst for all time.
With your permission, I will keep these remains for my laboratory...
.. and gain an insight into its origins and feeding habits.
Yes, well, do as you please, Merlin, but tidy up thoroughly.
Merlin... Oh, I'm sorry.
Might I prevail upon you to change my father over there into his old self?
It's seems...
- Later, later, my child!
More important matters demand my attention.
You and your father can wait in my quarters.
Wait a minute!
Everybody, stay right where you are!
Merlin, keep your mitts off Hermes!
Sandi, I'm all right.
- You are?
This is too much!
You reproduce yourself like a lizard's toe!
You change colours like a chameleon!
- I have documentary proof that Mordred is acquiring territory, arms and men for a takeover.
How did you acquire such holdings?
I see you've been levying your own taxes.
To what ends, Sir Mordred? Well?
To take over Camelot and, with it, England.
He sees himself in your chair, King.
Seize that knight!
- Death to Arthur!
Stop him!
Gawain, there's something unholy about this.
Wouldn't it be better to let him rest in peace?
Perhaps a dandelion poultice would help.
It's not as bad as I thought.
I can bypass his synthesiser and keep his command analyser functioning.
Maybe you can do something about Father.
- I told you, I saw your father. I talked to him.
Are you certain? He's about 12 stone and five-foot-nine.
He may be a little taller than that now.
We must thank you for revealing Mordred's treachery. Is there no way we can repay you?
No. I'm glad to help out.
We must inspect the castle defences.
I'm worried about Mordred's attack.
I may be able to help out there.
Hmm.
Hang in there, Hermes, we'll have you up and about in no time.
OK.
- No hard feelings about the joust?
You are so brave, Hermes.
Oh, don't worry, he's resting comfortably.
Clarence, weren't you supposed to help hide the valuables?
So... er...
.. how would you like a personally conducted tour of Stardust?
Oh... I think not.
I've got some LPs you haven't heard.
Fleetwood Mac, Rolling Stones.
Thanks, anyway.
Hey... why the hot and cold bit?
Didn't you say before the joust that you felt... pangs?
Oh, Thomas, I made an awful fool of myself.
I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
I bared my heart to... to your brother here and it turns out that he's full of wiggly things and smoke.
Look, Sandi, I'm just as human as you are.
I've got a mother and a father.
He's an optometrist in Poughkeepsie.
I squeaked through high school, but I did get a masters at college and lettered in baseball.
I took Mona Shanks to the senior prom and struck out there.
I've got a good job. What more do you want?
I am just an average American boy!
Don't you understand that?
No!
Oh, come on, Father.
Maybe we can get to see Merlin now.
Keep a sharp eye.
Fear not, sire, we shall defend our castle, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beach heads, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the courtyards and in the halls, we shall never surrender!
I'll be darned!
- Well said, Winston!
They'll probably come from the north.
- They'll come from the south.
Mordred will make an assault on the gates with battering rams and superior forces.
They'll have to bridge the moat first.
I have the answer to that.
You do?
- Yes, sir.
See that hay cart down there?
- We can all see the hay cart.
What wizardry hast thou now?
- This is called a laser gun.
Hermes was supposed to use it on planets for collecting rock samples.
You pull the trigger there and don't point it at anything that you wanna keep.
A cart is a cart. Let's see how effective it is against the stone walls of Camelot.
Wait one second.
OK, OK.
- Now?
Well, what do you think?
- Well...
I have always had the highest regard for you, Tom.
I remain, sire, your most obedient servant.
Gawain, please, cease thy fawning prattle.
This is very dangerous. Be careful it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
Don't worry, King, I keep it handy at all times.
Oaf... it's going to be impossible for Mordred to take Camelot with that American and his magic candle.
Oaf kill!
No. Arthur would have an immediate investigation.
There's more than one way to skin a cat, though it could get pretty sticky!
Find that demented girl and tell her the magician will see her in the lower chambers.
And I will take care of the American.
You understand what you are to do, Oaf?
Now, you be nice to the magician when he sees you. He's there to help.
Merlin is expecting us.
The first visit is two gold coins payable at time of treatment.
The magician will see you now.
Well, my dear, what is the matter?
I'm all right, sire, it's Father...
Let me go! Let me go!
Get rid of that accursed goose!
Don't eat it!
There'll be feathers all over the place!
Let me go!
Where is she?
- I know not, sire.
I was told that she would meet you here.
She wanted to hear some of your... LPs.
Thanks.
Fiendishly clever, the American.
Who else would've thought to hide it there?
But he did not reckon with the clairvoyant powers of the invincible Merlin!
Will it make a big noise again?
- Hope not.
I had the cotton packed too tightly last time.
That's why it exploded.
He's trying to get thrust to propel the craft into the air. Can't you see that?
Very good, Hermes.
- ( BLEEPS) Where's Sandi?
Forget about her. I cooled my heels for three hours waiting for her. She and I are through.
You put her out of your mind, too.
- (BLEEPS) That's not easy.
OK, here goes.
Hey!
I'm terribly sorry.
Use that dagger when Mordred attacks.
- I think I can fix it.
Hey, what have you got there?
- It's a goose, as anyone can plainly see.
It's a gander. Where did you find him?
- It was on the moat.
Then it flew up to the parapet.
He'll make a splendid supper.
No, he won't. Keep him in protective custody.
And... not that I care, but... where was the girl?
There was no girl about, just him.
I did hear a woman scream from yon wood.
- I saw her with Oaf, going to Merlin's room.
That quack?
King, I think we're in trouble.
You haven't misplaced her there?
- The laser gun's gone.
Who'd take it?
- Merlin!
He lured me out by saying Sandi would meet me.
Merlin and Mordred?
- Absolutely! They're in cahoots!
Where?
- They're partners. Where'd he take her?
The seaside is awfully nice this time of year.
Please!
- This is serious!
Mordred's camp, no doubt.
- We've got to do something!
Don't look at me.
- I'll take care of it myself.
You're not going after the wench?
- The poor kid needs help!
I got it! King, I need your armour.
Oh, really!
You keep forgetting you're a prisoner. I don't lend prisoners my armour. The answer is no.
Then Mordred will reduce Camelot to dust.
Well, perhaps my workaday armour.
No, your Sunday go-to-meeting armour, the shiniest you've got!
Page, fetch it.
Sounds like some monstrous cat.
- Like none I've ever heard.
What has it coughed up now?
It's a fine cart, but where do the oxen go?
- King, this is a battery-powered lunar rover.
This is the soil sampler... I'll explain later.
Clarence, buff me up.
I can't understand this fuss over a girl. I can find you five girls more comely than that one.
But not as dingy. Lower the drawbridge!
- I saw when the bridge is to be lowered!
I told you that.
- I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.
Lower the bridge!
Hold the fort until I get back.
Alas, we won't see him again.
This passageway will give us access to the castle.
At dawn, you will engage the defenders until the drawbridge can be lowered.
Won't this passage be defended?
- It is my secret passage.
The King has no knowledge of it.
- We'll do our best.
Have your men present in force when the portcullis is raised.
Enough to crush all resistance!
- Sire!
Sire, something approaches the camp.
- Something?
It has two eyes that light up the night and makes strange breathing sounds.
Call out the guards!
It is the American. He has taken the bait.
It's King Arthur himself.
- No, it's Tom Trimble.
I've come for Alisande.
- You shouldn't have come! They'll kill you!
With your choice of weapons!
- Get behind me.
That will serve little purpose. We have seen the awesome power of the magic candle.
It will annihilate you both in a flash.
Now, Mordred, do the honours.
Any parting words, American?
- I'd like to speak to Sandi for a second.
Be brief.
- All right.
Sandi, I just want you to know that I groove on you.
My idea of heaven would be to split a pizza and a 6-pack while watching the Super Bowl, maybe smooch a little at the half.
Well, what do you think?
- Any news of Father?
Didn't you hear? I told you I loved you!
- I'm not going all through that again.
On the other hand, if it's between you and Oaf...
.. I'll take you.
- Great! Pull down my visor. Get behind me.
Yes.
(TOM) Fire at will, Mordred!
Mordred, cease before you destroy your entire force.
He has bewitched it!
Stop them!
Oaf, hold these two! I'll settle with them later!
On to the tunnel!
Six o'clock and all's well!
(WHISPERS) Come on!
Oaf... Oaf... look.
To eat. You... eat.
Sit on my lap!
- No!
Sit on my lap!
Put your arm around me. It's safer.
Are you taking me to your nest?
- No, Camelot.
I hope it's got the same landlord when we get there!
Capture the gatehouse!
Look, sire, it's Tom!
- Ahhhhhh!
Well done!
Once more! The gatehouse!
Ahhhhh!
Come on!
Stand to!
(MORDRED) Lower the drawbridge!
Raise the portcullis!
Thank you, Tom. Well done.
Thank you. Well done.
Never have so many owed so much to one man.
What a nice thought.
Hah!
Look out!
Stop those bowmen!
Oh, really! I've told you before, never turn your back on the enemy. It's dangerous.
It's no way to be found after the battle.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Clarence! Sandi! The winch!
Come, Clarence, hurry!
Free the winch!
No, no! No, no, no!
OK, lower me down to the ledge.
We're to lower him to the ledge.
Make them pay dearly for every inch!
Hermes...
.. activate all systems.
Fire rocket engines one, two and three.
This American's wings must be clipped if we are to save the day.
Do not fear the contrivance! It has no power!
(TOM) Engage left thruster. 
Activate thrusters as your sensors warn of approaching danger.
Whoa! Take me back up to the ledge!
- You're too heavy!
# Oh, say can you see... #
Hermes, close the hatch.
Not so fast!
Destroy the American! He is our nemesis!
Hermes, set both magnetic fields on pulse.
He must be destroyed! Get him!
- Go on!
Get him!
A purse for the man who finishes him!
Increase power of magnetic fields.
Clarence, it's getting heavier!
The King said this armour was solid gold.
It's not.
I think he's in trouble.
- What kind?
It's difficult to say, but don't look, Sandi.
Ahhhhhhh!
Hermes, cut the power!
Come on, Father.
King, take 'em downtown and book 'em.
- Thank you, Tom.
We owe you our kingdom.
Victory!
Hooray! Hooray!
Gee, I don't know what to say.
Such distinguished company.
King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad...
Sir Gawain.
- Sir Gawain.
I will retire this chair and if ever you return, your place at the Round Table will be here.
Boy, they're never gonna believe this at the Cape! Yes, they will!
Everybody, group up there for the photograph.
The what?
- I'll show you in a minute.
Bunch in. Sandi, you and your father get over here. Clarence, scrunch in next to the king.
Put your arm around him, King.
Hurry up! And everybody say cheese!
(ALL) Cheese?
Now, King, this is what I mean by a photograph.
That's me!
- Yes, the whole gang!
King, you take this. When Merlin gets out, it'll drive him bananas.
Bananas?
- Yep.
Er... Sandi, could I talk to you for a second?
Well...
.. I'm going now.
I wish I could take you with me.
There's so many things I'd like to show you.
My old MG, my ten-speed.
The Space Mound, the Grand Canyon.
That would be very nice.
But I just don't know if you'd survive the trip.
You could age 1,000 years before we re-entered.
I understand and thank you for getting Merlin to change my father back into his old self.
Sure.
Would... Would you give this to Hermes, please?
Sure.
Bye.
Clarence, I wanna thank you.
You helped change the course of history.
Did I?
- You certainly did.
Thank you, Hermes.
This is a token of our appreciation.
If it fails, will he stay with us?
- We have a place for him in the chapel.
But...
- Don't bother me. I've important work to do.
It's from his Uncle Sam.
- Really? How nice.
Minus 10 and counting.
- Let's see if we can get off the ground.
Ignition.
Blast off.
We have lift-off.
We did it!
From Sandi.
"Dear Hermes, I think you are sweet and I will remember you fondly,
"but there can never be anything serious between us.
"I have given the matter a lot of thought and I like Tom best,
"but it was not an easy decision. Alisande. "
Ready?
Is the clock winding the right way?
Year 680.
- Good man.
Robot.
We're travelling 290,000 miles a second and someone wants us to move over?
So that's where you've been lately.
Look at that. "Father" laid an egg!
How could we have been so wrong (?)
- Not bad for a goose over 100 years old.
You're right.
You're right! He... She hasn't changed a bit!
Look at her feathers, look at her eyes!
That means that Sandi wouldn't age either!
Hermes, right thruster - 180 degrees!
What on earth will you do with her?
- You mean, what will I do with her on earth?
Live happily ever after. Isn't that what you're supposed to do in a situation like this?
Daddy?
- Daddy, are you home?
- Maybe he isn't.
Of course he is. Daddy!
Find him?
- Does it look like I found him, Stanley?
- Well, I just thought...
Dad!
Daddy?
Don't worry about your father, Barbara.
I'm sure he's all right.
Oh, I don't know.
- Honey, I'm sure...
- Daddy!
Daddy, are you there?
- We shouldn't have left him alone.
- Honey, he wanted to come here.
- Don't get yourself all upset.
- Daddy?
Honey, what...?
- Stanley!
- OK, I'm coming.
- Daddy!
- I'm coming!
I told you over and over again he should not be left in this house alone.
It's too big for one man in his condition.
Honey, he wanted to be left alone.
You always take his side, don't you? Daddy!
Dad?
- Who the fuck are you?
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I don't know.
- You don't?
- How come you don't know?
- I just moved up.
- Let me see your dog tags.
- Let's see it.
Where are they?
- I can't find them.
- He's a Kraut!
- He don't look like one.
- I'm an American.
- Prove it!
- Prove it?
- Who plays third for the Tigers?
- The Tigers?
The Detroit Tigers.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
- What d'you ask him for?
- It came into my head.
- You guys go on without me.
- Where's your weapon, soldier?
- I don't have one.
- Everybody's got one!
I'm a chaplain.
I'm an assistant chaplain.
- What's your name?
- Pilgrim.
You know why this got three sides on it, Pilgrim?
- No.
- Makes a slit that don't close up.
Gee, that's great.
You stick a GI knife in a guy and it makes a slit, right?
- Right.
- A slit closes up, right?
- Right.
- This makes a three-sided slit.
It kills you, Pilgrim.
- What's that?
- Chaplain's assistant.
- No shit! What's your name?
- His name's Pilgrim.
You know how to pray?
Then start praying!
- Where the hell are we, Corp?
- Belgium, stupid.
Don't fuck around.
You tell Paul Lazzaro where we are!
- We're in the middle of Krauts!
- You got us here, get us out!
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily...
Just beyond those trees on the other side there's a farmhouse.
Listen, you guys go on without me.
I'll be all right, honest.
I'm gonna scout that farmhouse, you hear?
And if it's clear, I'll fire my carbine three times spaced. You got it?
Got it!
That son of a bitch ditches us,
I'll kill him.
- We could surrender.
- What?
We could surrender, couldn't we?
We'd just have to stay here and...
Listen to me!
Me and the corporal and the dago, we're Americans, we don't surrender!
- You got that?
- He's took off.
That corporal.
He'll get back home after the war, he'll be a big hero.
Dames will be climbing all over him.
Couple of years will go by and one day there's gonna be a knock on his door and there'll be this stranger.
"Paul Lazzaro sent me," the stranger will say and then he'll pull out a gun and shoot his pecker off.
Stranger will give him a couple of seconds to think about who Paul Lazzaro is and what life's gonna be like without a pecker, then he'll shoot him once in the guts and walk away.
Yes.
'Billy, you time-tripping again?'
Mm-hm.
I can always tell, you know, when you've been time-tripping.
You were back in the war, weren't you?
Time travel's a bitch for you, isn't it?
Particularly the war.
I can't help it.
Well, why don't we see if old Mother Montana can't keep you stuck right here for a while?
- How about a little kiss?
- A little kiss?
- Yeah, a little kiss.
- A little kiss.
- A what?
- A little kiss.
You fucking faggot!
- What's the matter?
- You fucking fairy!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
- What's the matter, faggot?
- I was thinking of a girl.
He said he wanted to kiss me.
- I was imagining things and I was...
- Just give me the knife.
Come on, will you?
Come on!
Billy, you're wonderful.
- Oh, I'm so glad I waited.
- I'm glad we waited too.
Otherwise, it wouldn't have seemed the same tonight.
No, it wouldn't.
It starts the whole marriage off on the right foot.
Yeah. Yeah.
I know when you were in the war you must have had... experiences.
- Well...
- No, don't tell me about them!
It was wartime.
And anyway, it's different for a man than for a woman.
I understand that.
I'm just so glad we waited.
So am I.
And you know what?
I'm gonna lose weight just for you, Billy.
See, before I needed a reason, and now... I have one!
Hey, Billy.
I think we've begun the life of a new hero.
- How can you tell?
- Because I'm a woman.
Huh!
And you know what, Billy?
What?
I never thought anybody would ever marry me.
I did.
Oh, Jesus, Pilgrim!
Stay off my feet, will ya?
- Oh, walk right, will ya?
- Gee, I'm sorry.
You step on his feet again, you son of a bitch, and I'll break your ass, you hear me?
Komme her. Schnell. Sofort.
Good. Hold it.
Look out here now.
- Can you get the sign in?
- The sign's in good.
OK, smile.
Look at the camera and smile.
- Looks good.
- Hold it right there.
Big smile now.
Big smile!
'Good. Hold that kiss.'
We got it!
All you dog faces from the 451st over here.
Fall in here.
It's your old colonel, boys.
It's Wild Bob.
451st.
You! You from the 451st?
Some of you boys must be from the 451st.
You, soldier, I know you, don't I?
What's your name, soldier?
- Pilgrim, sir.
- Pilgrim. Of course! I remember you.
Damn fine rifleman.
Fine rifleman, Pilgrim.
One of the best in the 451st.
First in peace, first in war, and first...
Get your hands off me!
An officer's place is with his men!
My men need me and I'm staying with 'em!
Don't worry, it's your old colonel, boys.
Wild Bob is with you.
No formalities.
At ease, at ease.
By God, Wild Bob's proud of you.
There are dead Germans all over the place, wishing to God they'd never...
I'm staying with my men.
All right, all right.
God bless you, boys.
Bless you, boys.
By God, boy, you're a good soldier.
You'll come through this all right.
And when you get to Cody, Wyoming, just ask for Wild Bob.
We'll have one hell of a reunion.
God bless you, boys!
Bless you, boys!
A fag frolic in Wyoming.
I'll be there, Pilgrim, waiting for you.
This ain't so bad.
I been in a lot worse spots than this.
Troy, winter of '37.
Cold? I'll tell you!
Or take the time
Watkins and me decked the yard bull at White River junction.
Had us in the pen for three weeks in our skivvies.
Would have had pneumonia if we hadn't jumped the place.
They took us up to Burlington to check us out.
Last I heard, Joe was somewheres on the Allagash.
You try that sometime, pal.
You try that sometime in February in 1934, then see if you think this is so bad.
There are plenty of worse places.
Plenty of worse places, believe me.
He was at the top of his class in optometry school when this happened.
I don't doubt it, Mrs Pilgrim.
The doctor says it's nervous exhaustion.
I'm sure that's all it is.
I think it's the war.
That certainly could have a lot to do with it.
But he had some awful experiences.
He was in Dresden when it was bombed.
His closest friend was killed there.
Dreadful, dreadful.
And, of course, his father passed on, you know, while Billy was in training.
But I knew God would send Billy home safe to me.
I prayed every night,
Mr Rosewater.
Even though we don't belong to a church of our choice.
We're all in God's hands, dear.
Billy! Billy, Mama's here.
You can come out now.
He's engaged to a very rich girl.
Her name's Valencia,
Valencia Merble.
- Her father's Lionel Merble.
- Oh, of course.
He owns the Ilium School of Optometry where Billy was going.
He's also building a brand-new home for them on the lake for a wedding present.
It's a surprise.
Billy. Billy, sweetheart.
The war is over.
You can come out now.
Pilgrim!
You killed me, Pilgrim.
You son of a bitch.
You call my mom and dad in Pittsburgh, see.
You tell them I died and that you killed me!
Weary.
This is Paul Lazzaro, Weary.
I'll get revenge for you.
- Lazzaro.
- Yeah.
Hey, did I ever tell you what happened to the dog?
It's hot.
Son of a bitch dog bit me so I got some steak.
And I got me the spring out of a clock and I cut that spring up into little pieces and I stuck it into the steak, way inside.
And I went to where they had that dog tied up and I said, "Hey, boy.
"I'm not mad. Let's be friends."
And I threw him the steak, and I waited for around ten minutes.
And he started crying and the blood spilled out of his mouth.
He tried to chew out his own insides, and I said,
"Hey, boy.
"That's me inside there with those knives."
Anybody ask you the sweetest thing in the world, it's revenge.
Weary's dead, Pilgrim.
The patient here has been suffering from trauma which we think can be successfully treated by electric shock.
- Hello, Billy.
- Hello.
We've prescribed a series of 12 and we're up to number seven.
The patient was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was bombed.
He claims that well over 100,000 people were burned to death in the fire.
Worse than Hiroshima.
And since Billy was actually there, it's natural enough to assume that this has had a contributing effect on his present condition.
He's ready, Doctor.
You're going to sleep now, Billy.
Schnell!
- Name?
- Paul Lazzaro.
That's two Zs.
Parents?
I don't got no family.
I said two Zs.
To whom we send the number in case of death?
Send it to him.
This is your tag.
Don't forget it.
Jawohl.
Name?
Parents?
You want it now, Pilgrim, or would you like it in the morning?
What do you want?
Hey, hey! Why me?
Oh, you're on my list, pal.
A ufstehen...
Gear it down there, fella.
These Germans can be awfully mean.
Oh, yeah? Well, they don't know Paul Lazzaro.
Listen, we Americans have got to stick together.
- Who are you, Pop?
- I'm Edgar Derby.
Yeah? Well, I got something for you to stick, Derby.
All right, all right.
Hey, you fucking goon!
All right!
I'm taking 'em off!
Leave me alone, I'll take 'em off!
A ufstehen your ass!
I'm warning ya, pal.
All right, son. Over here.
Here we go, Billy boy.
I'll take you out.
- Time to sink or swim!
- That's the way to do it, Mr Pilgrim.
- Best thing in the world for him.
- Here we go, boy.
By God, Pilgrim.
You're really going to do it.
You bet your boots
I'm going to do it.
His mama's not gonna keep him all of his life.
My old man did the same to me.
I'll never forget it.
- Done me a world of good.
- Oh, you betcha! It's the only way.
Well, this is it, Billy boy.
It's sink or swim!
And don't...
Billy?
Billy?
Billy!
- Who are they?
- They're Russian prisoners.
♪ Hail, hail, the Yanks are here
♪ Join the men from Dover till the war is over
♪ We bid you welcome here
♪ With a little food and cheer, you're welcome here
♪ To share our food
♪ And cheer ♪
Evening. Come along inside.
We've organized a little welcome for you in here.
We were lucky we had a couple of days' notice of your arrival.
That gave us an opportunity to prepare.
Hear you had a beastly time in the Ardennes.
Jerry put on quite a show there, I hear.
It can't last forever, can it?
Just take it easy, pal.
- Where'd you get all this?
- Red Cross. Clerical error.
They've been sending us
500 parcels a month instead of 50.
Three years now.
We've got rather a lot, actually.
Shouldn't you tell 'em?
I mean, shouldn't you give it back?
Oh, Yank, you haven't been in the fight for very long, have you?
Come along.
I keep forgetting wars have always been fought by children.
Where did you get this absurd garment?
- They gave it to me.
- Who?
The Germans.
They didn't give you a coat, they gave you an insult.
Hey, son. Over here.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Jerry tried to humiliate you.
Now you must wear that coat as if you were proud of it.
Teach him a lesson.
It's terribly important that you understand that.
It's been almost four years since I was taken prisoner.
True of most of us here.
We haven't seen a woman or a child in all of that time.
Think about that for a minute.
Do you want to know how we survived?
Well, I'll tell you.
The day that I was captured,
I made a promise to myself.
I vowed that each day I would brush my teeth, shave my beard, wash my hands before each meal and evacuate my bowels with as much regularity as circumstances would permit.
And do you know why?
Because the war consists of continual petty humiliations.
And I for one was going to treat myself with self-respect and survive.
Do you think you can do it?

Pilgrim!
Can ya hear me, Pilgrim?
Huh? Can ya hear me, Pilgrim?
When do you want it, huh?
When do you want it, Pilgrim?
You'll never know when it's gonna happen.
- Maybe years, maybe not.
- All right, son.
This pork chop killed a friend of mine.
- I didn't. I just...
- This man is sick.
- Yeah? Well, he's gonna be dead.
- Out.
- You wanna make the list?
- Outside, Lazzarino.
- Lazzaro! L-A-Z...
- Out!
You threaten this man again,
I'll break you in half.
- Are you all right?
- Don't ever answer the door, Pop.
You tell him what happens.
Nobody fucks around with Paul Lazzaro.
You tell him!
Boy's all twisted up inside.
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
What's he got against you?
He's got this crazy idea that I caused his friend's death.
- I didn't. I bumped into him...
- I'm sure you didn't.
I'll talk some turkey to that boy.
- What happened to me?
- You passed out back there and I brought you in here.
Here. Try some of this.
This will fix you up.
Kinda hot.
Thank you.
Attaboy. Taste pretty good?
Uh-huh.
You don't have to stay.
What the heck.
I might as well.
I got some food when I was back there.
I don't mean to be impolite, but how come you're in the army?
I couldn't stay out, not with the Nazis and the Japanese threatening to conquer the world.
As a matter of fact, I got a boy your age seeing action in the South Pacific.
- Hey, that's really something.
- Yeah.
I used to tell my students there's a monster loose in the world.
One day I got tired of telling 'em and I said goodbye and I joined up.
- I thought you were a teacher.
- Oh, come on.
You have that confidence and a very good way with words.
I'll tell you one thing.
We don't mince phraseologies at Boston Trade and Industrial.
Oh, boy.
I wonder, if my father were still alive, if, uh...
I don't think he would have.
Don't you ever sell him short, son.
Mom would never have let him.
You couldn't blame her, could you?
But then I'm lucky, I guess.
Margaret's a very understanding woman.
We were childhood sweethearts.
Hey, that's nice.
You got a girl back home?
No one special.
Margaret's the only woman
I've ever known.
There's Margaret.
Aw, she looks awful nice.
She's just about everything a man could ask for.
Oh, oh. What's this?
That's my mom in our backyard.
Oh, you have a very nice-looking mother.
- Yeah, she is.
- Very nice.
- That's a nice house too.
- That's the back.
It's a nice yard.
Nice.
When did you enlist?
It wasn't quite like that, see?
I was drafted.
Oh?
It's not that I didn't wanna go,
I just wanted to finish school first.
- Where were you in school?
- The Ilium School of Optometry.
An optometrist?
That's a very good field.
Yes, it is, 'cause you're doing things for people and there'll always be a need for optometrists.
Boy, what you just said is a very good philosophical way of life.
- What?
- About filling a need and helping people.
Why, that's self-determination and free enterprise backing itself up all the way.
That's why we're in Europe stopping Hitler.
My name's Edgar Derby, son.
What's yours?
- Billy Pilgrim.
- Billy, it's nice to have you aboard.
- Thank you.
- You had enough of that?
Yes, I did. Thank you.
The English gave me these boots for ya.
Don't mind the silver paint.
They did that for a skit about Cinderella.
It was darn funny.
It was a lot of singing and dancing and crazy stuff.
Yeah, I admire the English, you know.
They have a great philosophical way of life.
Keep themselves going, you know, putting on shows, Gilbert and Sullivan.
What's this?
♪ She's his sweetheart
- ♪ He's her vow...
- Happy anniversary.
♪ He's her Billy
- ♪ She's his Val...
- Oh, Billy!
- ♪ They were married...
- Your diamond! Why did you do it?
- ♪ Never to part ♪
- When I go on this diet just for you,
I'm going to be so sexy.
I'll make you so happy.
Just wait and see.
Look. Isn't it divine?
Goodness!
This diamond has a story to it.
Billy actually found it in Germany during the war.
Billy, tell them about it.
Oh, go ahead, darling, tell them.
Billy's too modest so I'll tell you.
- When he was a prisoner in this...
- Good boy, Billy.
Thanks.
They gave him an awful coat to wear.
Congrats, Billy.
What was his name, hon?
- Who?
- The one that was killed in Dresden.
- Edgar Derby.
- Oh, that's right.
Poor old Edgar Derby.
Oh, that was really awful.
They shot him for, uh...
What was it, Billy?
Well, anyway, before that they found this diamond right in the pocket of Billy's coat.
Lord knows how it got there and why somebody didn't find it before.
It probably came from some poor Jew they'd taken it away from.
So many of them had their money in diamonds.
Jesus, Dad!
I'm on the john.
My, God, Robert.
There's a party going on downstairs.
Why don't you lock the door?
'Cause Mom broke the lock last time I locked it, that's why.
- Can't I have any privacy?
- What have you got there?
- Where?
- There.
You shouldn't be reading that kind of junk, Robert.
Jesus!
Lads. Lads.
Hey, Billy!
Billy. Over here.
Can I have your attention?
Please, please, please.
You're being transferred to a camp in Dresden.
You're going to be leaving for there this afternoon.
Actually, I'm quite envious of you.
Dresden is a beautiful city.
Paid a visit there myself before the war.
Besides being quite lovely, it's quite safe.
It's an open city without war industries or troop concentrations.
It's by far the safest place to be until we get this all over with.
Now, then, you must elect a leader.
He's going to be in charge of all this group.
You'll all be under his direct orders and he will be your line of communication with the Germans.
Nominations are now open.
You need a leader.
I nominate Paul Lazzaro.
Lazzaro. Right.
Anyone else?
- Well, then...
- I nominate Edgar Derby.
Anyone else?
You'll be responsible, all of you, to this man you elect, and he'll be responsible to the Germans.
So, if you mess him up, he's the one they're gonna be after.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Pop, you want it so bad, you got it.
I un-nominate Lazzaro.
'I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone' when I introduce our Lions Club president for the coming year.
Our own Billy Pilgrim.
The floor's all yours. Good luck.
Oh, shut up, will ya?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Mr Walters, Fellow Lions.
I want you to know that I'll do my best to live up to the...
...confidence you showed by "chosing"... choos... by having chose me here today.
Uh, and I know that my first responsibility...
...is to see each and every one of you gets through this safely and are reunited with your loved ones.
I'd like to ask you...
I know we're all of different faiths, but we're all Americans...
Oh, God.
...to bow our heads together for a moment and pray.
Oh, go take a flying fuck, will you?
If that isn't the most obscene, vulgar... Oh!
'Is my bath ready, Silvio?'
'Yes, Mistress.'
'My robe, Silvio.'
Honestly!
To show this kind of junk at a family drive-in, it's disgraceful!
'Why do you avert your eyes from me, Silvio?'
Why you wanted to take the children to it is beyond me.
- 'Massalina can give you salvation...'
- Oh, Robert!
You shouldn't see that!
Mom!
'Do you find Massalina unattractive?'
- Oh, gross!
- Wow!
- That's it, that's enough!
- Jesus, Mom!
They show more than that in health class.
Billy, take us home.
I don't want to hear another word.
Shit!
I will not tolerate that kind of language in front of me, goddamn it!
I am not going to subject myself to that filth out there or allow my children to be subjected to it.
That is the end of that.
- Billy, I am talking to you!
- 'Come on.'
- 'Silvio. Silvio.'
- Billy!
Billy.
Billy! Come here.
See how you like this one.
"Dear Meg,
"We're on our way to Dresden to do some work for the Germans.
"It won't be war work because the Geneva Convention prohibits that,
"and besides, there isn't any war production in Dresden.
"Dresden is the town where our porcelain dancing figure came from.
"Remember the one that Johnny knocked off the table and broke?
"Dresden's never been bombed because it isn't a military target
"so we'll be safe there.
"Please write to Johnny and give him all my love
"and tell him I know we'll all be back together again soon.
"Tell him how proud I am of him."
- Where is he?
- Your boy's in the car, Mr Pilgrim.
He's the only one we actually caught.
They knocked over
14 gravestones, all told.
I just can't understand why he'd do such a thing.
Has he said anything about Catholics?
I mean, has he anything against them?
No. We've got a lot of Catholic friends.
What will the McNalleys think?
What are we going to say to them?
Mr Pilgrim, if I could see you up here for a moment.
My, God! Why did he do it?
Look, I don't want to take the boy down to the station.
I figured it might be embarrassing to you.
Maybe we could handle it in some other way.
Thank you very much, Officer.
If you get the damages from the church,
I'd be happy to pay for that.
I'll see what I can do about that, Mr Pilgrim.
And I'd like to show my appreciation by giving this to the policeman's fund.
You don't have to do that, Mr Pilgrim, but it's very generous of you.
I'll call you after we've been able to determine the extent of the damages.
What's the matter, Billy?
You must be the greatest father in the world.
I love my son, Billy.
Guess that's all it takes.
Hey, you guys. We're there.
It's beautiful.
- I never saw anything like it.
- It's lovely.
It's the Land of Oz.
Ich bin the American Kommandant.
These men...
Ich bin the American...
Guess you'd better go across.
OK, men.
Everybody on the other side.
Ich bin the American Kommandant.
Perhaps you understand English.
- Back at the camp the men chose me...
- Go back in line.
I was told to take charge.
OK, fellas.
Move out. Move out.
Don't you be fooling around with any oo-la-las in Montreal, Billy.
How can I cheat with your old man around?
That won't be so hard.
We just make an agreement.
- You don't talk and I don't talk.
- Daddy, shame on you!
Hey, come on, Billy.
We're on our way.
- Bye-bye, Barb.
- Bye, Val.
Have a good time.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, hon.
- Have a good time.
- OK.
Bye!
Bye.
I know there's gonna be meetings, a little business, but I really mostly wanna see you enjoy yourself.
By God, you deserve it.
You really do.
You want me to tell you a secret, huh?
Well, I wouldn't tell anybody this, of course, but... when Valencia brought you home and wanted to marry you, to tell you the honest-to-God truth,
I thought she'd brought home a first-class loser!
I'm not kidding.
I really thought that.
But you proved me wrong, Billy.
I'm the first to admit it.
You proved old Lionel wrong.
Dad?
- The plane's gonna crash.
- Oh, come on, Billy boy!
In 25 minutes the whole thing cracks up.
You can't get out of your seat!
- Stop the plane. It's gonna crash.
- No one's allowed in the cockpit, sir.
- I organized this. I'm responsible...
- Do you want to be removed?
- But you don't understand!
- We've got clearance for take-off.
Everything's going to be all right.
Buckle in and leave the driving to us.
Lousy, drunk son of a bitch!
God, I hate these charter flights.
♪ Oh, there's a change in the weather, there's a change in the scene
♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom
♪ So from now on there'll be a change in me
♪ My walk will be different, my talk and my name
♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom... ♪
Are you sure you feel all right?
That sure was a lousy joke you pulled back there, about the plane crashing.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- Forget it.
Hey, Stewardess, bring this young fella another drink!
♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom
♪ There'll be some changes made today ♪
Billy!
Schlachthof fünf.
This is Schlachthof fünf.
Fünf is English five.
Schlacht is slaughter.
Hof is house.
Schlachthof fünf:
Slaughterhouse-Five.
Your house.
The rules of the Geneva Convention...
You must learn the address for your own well-being.
In event of emergency, you will say Schlachthof fünf.
Say it, please.
- Schlacht.
- Schlacht.
- Hof.
- Hof.
- Fünf!
- Fünf.
Schlachthof fünf.
Schlachthof fünf.
Schlachthof fünf.
Fünf.
Schlachthof...
...fünf.
Schlachthof fünf.
Schlachthof fünf.
...hof fünf.
Schlachthof fünf.
I'm coming, Billy!
I'm coming!
I'm coming to you!
For God's sakes, lady!
Why'd you jam on your brakes?
- Look what you've done!
- My Billy fell out of a plane!
- You all right?
- I was on my way to the hospital!
- I missed my entrance!
- I'll drive you.
It's in Vermont, stupid!
Billy.
- Hey, let me see your license!
- I haven't got time!
You can't leave the scene of an accident, lady!
Your exhaust is shot to hell!
Damn it, lady!
You're going the wrong way!
Get out of the way!
Goddamn!
Get outta the way!
First she backed into me.
Then she went up the ramp the wrong way and...
Oh, my God, here she comes again.
I'm coming to you, Billy.
I'm coming!
Sweetheart? Honey?
- What?
- Wake up, wake up.
- What? What?
- Wake up!
- Here.
- What is this?
Billy! What is this?
Follow it and find out.
- Billy! Oh, Billy.
- Come on.
You're always up to something.
You're wonderful.
Thank you. Beautiful!
- But did you make this bow?
- Never mind the bow.
- Follow the yellow brick road.
- It's beautiful.
Follow the yellow brick road!
- Follow the yellow brick road! Oh, Billy!
- Come on, follow it.
Billy!
Come on, Mama! Follow.
Follow the yellow brick road!
- Did you really make this bow?
- Mom! Come on down, Mom.
- Never mind.
- Mom! Hurry!
- Just follow the yellow brick road.
- I'm coming.
Robert!
Mom, hurry.
- Billy, I can't go out like this.
- Of course you can.
Follow the golden thread.
A Cadillac! Oh, Billy!
- Happy birthday, hon.
- Happy birthday, Mom!
A Cadillac! A white Cadillac!
It's what I've always wanted!
Come on, Robert!
I've always wanted a white Cadillac!
- Oh, Billy. Oh, sweetheart.
- And now you got it.
- Oh, it's a little tight.
- You can adjust the seat with this, see?
- Oh, no, no! That's too tight!
- Or backward.
- You can make it go up...
- Oh, no, it's squishing me!
- Or down.
- It's wonderful!
I'm gonna lose weight!
Oh, I'm really gonna lose weight, Billy.
I love you. I love you.
Get the stretcher! Quick!
- Was he alert in the ER?
- No, not very.
His right eye was dilating and his blood pressure was up.
He seemed pretty drowsy.
He's shaved and prepped, Doctor.
Let's get the pressure off.
- Are the instruments ready?
- Yes, Doctor.
Better get in as quickly as you can.
His right pupil no longer reacts to light.
Scalpel.
'Cautery.'
Electric burr.
Let me have some saline.
'Each day you will recite your number' so we'll know how many men are here.
There'll be no talking to Germans unless talked to.
When the war is over, we'll talk.
Let's make another burr hole right here.
Each day you will be given a working assignment for factory, cleaning or mail.
But there is not going to be any talking to Germans.
When you talk, you talk to your guards only.
Blood pressure is falling off.
'Eins, zwei!'
Eins, zwei! Eins, zwei!
What are you giving him now?
I'm still giving him D5W.
The pressure's coming up now.
Let's see how we do in the next five or ten minutes.
Mrs Shaw?
I'm Doctor Ellenbogen.
Your father's gonna be all right.
It was very difficult, but he came through in good shape.
Stanley, he's gonna be all right!
That's wonderful.
Did you find Mother?
Well, it... it's crazy, Barbara.
I... I don't understand.
What's crazy, Stanley?
Where's Mama?
Come on, honey.
L-let's sit down.
Listen, I think we'll take care of your father till he's able to take care of himself.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Well, I looked all over for your mom and then I asked one of the nurses.
And they said that... that she died about three hours ago.
So I had to find out if it was the right one.
And it was. She was.
How?
I don't know, uh...
She had some kind of accident with the car and got carbon monoxide poisoning.
But she drives a Cadillac!
Honey, I don't know.
That's what they told me.
Oh, God.
I know. I know.
- Darling, how you feeling?
- Dirty sons of bitches.
- What's the matter?
- Bureaucratic bastards.
They have the audacity to put me in a room with a basket case.
- They just don't have a private room.
- Well, I don't know.
Goddamn it, Lily!
I'm gonna pepper your Radcliffe ass with buckshot if I ever catch you smoking again!
You better stay in condition to keep up with B.C. Rumfoord.
You guys go on without me.
I'll be all right.
Christ. All he does in his sleep is quit and surrender and apologize.
Shoot! I could carve a better man out of a banana.
Did you bring me those books from Widener?
The boys at the Harvard Crimson have a beautiful bit about you, honey.
They call you the Red Baron of military history and want you to get well soon.
Those little bastards!
The Truman statement about Hiroshima is in here, and those eight
Army Air Force documents.
Oh, yeah.
And the Irving book on Dresden.
I was there.
Honey, why did they keep Dresden a secret for so long?
Oh, hell. For fear a lot of bleeding hearts would say bombing it was a chickenshit thing to do.
My book's gonna lay it on the line, sweetheart.
Nobody's gonna weep and wail over Dresden after they read my book.
I was there.
- What's he saying?
- He said he was there.
Says he was where?
Dresden.
At Dresden, B.C.!
The hell with him.
Let him write his own book.
'Schlachthof fünf. '
'What the hell is he saying now?'
'Ich bin amerikanischer Soldat.'
Dresden.
- Schlachthof fünf.
- You wanna know something?
We didn't start the last war, the Nazis did.
And 135,000 people dying in Dresden does not seem so very much when put against over five million Allies who had to die!
And you just might remember that when we were bombing Dresden
'the Germans were sending
V-1 and V-2 rockets into London,
'killing men, women and children.'
- 'Don't get so uptight.'
- 'Jesus!
'It gives me a pain, weeping over Dresden
'and not giving a damn about our own losses!
'Hey, what about Coventry?
What about Rotterdam?'
What about the extermination camps the Germans ran, gassing millions?
I want your attention.
Attention, please.
You are having a visitor.
Howard Campbell Jr.
I have just come from the Russian Front so I'll make it short.
I don't wanna take up your time.
I know how hungry you are.
- Food's not much though, is it?
- Food's almost as neat as your outfit!
Men, I have a proposition for you.
How would you like to come back to America after this war as heroes?
Great, as long as I could wear that fag outfit!
Since you're so interested in my outfit,
I'll tell you what it's about.
Blue is for the American sky.
White is for the race that pioneered that continent, cleared the forests, drained the swamps, built the roads and the bridges.
And the red is for the blood of fine American boys that's been shed in defense of your freedom.
I don't see you shedding any blood, Campbell.
You all know that Communism is out to enslave the world.
And who's out there trying to stop them?
The Germans!
They're not your enemies, they're your allies!
Communism is the enemy of all of us!
I want volunteers for the Free American Corps, men who are willing to stand up to these commies.
Sit down, Lazzaro!
- I didn't vote for you, Derby.
- Good. Who's next?
If we don't stop them now...
Everybody moves to the air shelter.
There'll be no bombs.
Churchill's nephew lives in Dresden.
Don't worry, soldier.
Well, men, do I have only one volunteer?
Listen, pal,
I only stood up back there to tell you that one day your doorbell's gonna ring, see, and there's gonna be this guy in a trench coat...
We'll eat German craw for so long because we have to, but we'd rather die than eat your dung, which is sick and lousy and foul!
History will prove you an ass.
Oh, shit.
No bombs, eh, Campbell?
You can't trust the Jews.
Daddy, you should really stay with us.
And you shouldn't talk about Mama or the accident or even the war.
- I just wanna go home.
- But we want you with us!
- I'll be fine.
- Just for one night?
- No.
- Oh, Daddy. Honestly!
Daddy, you should consider yourself lucky.
Practically every optometrist in Ilium was wiped out.
Stanley's been working night and day for you.
Stinking old dog.
Hello, Spot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Daddy, honestly!
Won't you please change your mind and come stay with us?
You'll be in this empty house with that old dog.
- I'll be all right.
- But, Daddy, be a little realistic.
You just turned middle-aged.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Good night, dear.
You pigs!
You damned pigs!
Mama!
Mama!
- Dad?
- Papa!
Dad?
Dad?
Robert?
Hiya, Dad. Hi, Spot.
How did you get here?
Well, they...
They gave me leave to visit Mom.
- But you know that...
- Sure, Dad. I know.
That's why I'm here.
And to see you.
How are you, Dad?
I'm fine.
God, Dad, to think that you lived.
It's a miracle.
Like one time when a chopper got hit by Charlie just outside our camp.
It came down like a stone.
But the door gunner walked away.
Dad?
Dad, I did the right thing, joining up.
I'm sure you did, son.
Everybody knows it's a lousy war but sooner or later it's gonna be us or the Communists.
We've gotta stand up to them somewhere.
Dad?
Dad?
I know you and Mom worried about me a lot.
I guess I haven't been the best of sons.
- You've been just fine, Robert.
- No, I...
I know I was pretty wild and I wanna make up for it.
Remember that stuff in the cemetery? Jeez!
I'm so ashamed of that now.
Really, I am.
But I've changed a lot, Dad.
I just hope I can make you real proud of me from now on.
You already have, Robert.
Dad, will you come to Mom's grave with me?
I'm not ready yet.
I know how you feel, Dad.
I'm just not ready.
OK, Dad.
What's happened?
Where am I?
'Welcome to the planet Tralfamadore, Mr Pilgrim.'
Tralfam...
- Tralfama...
- 'Tralfamadore.'
Oh.
- How did I get here?
- 'There is no how, Mr Pilgrim.
'There is no why.
The moment simply is.'
I don't understand.
- Where are you?
- 'Oh, you can't see us, Mr Pilgrim.
'We live in the fourth dimension.
'But we can see you,
'and there are many important
Tralfamadorians here to welcome you.'
Oh. Well, uh...
How do you do?
'We hope that you'll find your accommodations here suitable.'
I have to stay here?
'I'm afraid so.'
You mean, I can't leave of my own free will?
'Mr Pilgrim,
'we have visited
31 inhabited planets in the universe.
'We have studied reports on a hundred more.
'And only on Earth is there any talk of free will.'
Well, what'll I do?
You will aid in the removal of the bodies.
Those that are identifiable will be tagged.
Their personal effects will be tagged and given to an officer.
There will be a classification according to the degree that the victim can be identified.
Any looting or stealing will be dealt with by a firing squad.
Follow me.
'It looked like the end of the world.'
'What looked like the end of the world, Mr Pilgrim?'
'Dresden, after the bombing.'
'Don't be so egocentric, Mr Pilgrim.
'We know how the world ends, and it has nothing to do with Earth,
'except that it gets wiped out too.'
'Really? How does it end?'
'While we're experimenting with new fuels,
'a Tralfamadorian test pilot panics, presses the wrong button
'and the whole universe disappears.'
'But you have to stop him!
'If you know this, can't you keep the pilot from pressing...?
'He has always pressed it
'and he always will.
'We always let him and we always will let him.
'The moment is structured that way.'
'Mr Pilgrim, a pleasant way to spend eternity
'is to ignore the bad times and concentrate on the good.'
It's... It's all right!
It's all right!
Will you be quiet, please?
Will you please be quiet?
Can't you see you're frightening her?
Who are you?
Who are you?
- My name's Pilgrim.
- What's this scene?
Where are we?
- We're on a distant planet.
- 'Are you mating now?'
What?
'Have you mated?'
Who are you?
'I'm a Tralfamadorian,
Miss Wildhack.'
A what?
'You're on the planet Tralfamadore,
Miss Wildhack,
'423 billion miles from Earth.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
- You're OK?
- Yes, thank you.
When were you born?
What month?
- What month?
- What month?
July.
July. What day?
The fourth.
The fourth of July.
You're practical with a belief in others based on your own integrity and an almost compulsive honesty.
You're a moon child!
Oh, you're a moon child.
- I'm a what?
- A moon child.
That's your sign.
Were you born in the morning or the afternoon?
It doesn't matter.
I don't have my charts.
Miss Wildhack?
Would you like something to wear?
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.
I was, uh...
I was down in Palm Springs at a home of a producer friend of mine, sunning myself by the pool.
That's why I'm like this.
I don't want halter marks.
Naturally.
And all of a sudden, it was like a... a ray.
- This is all I can offer.
- Thank you.
- And...
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
That's all there is.
And the next thing, I was...
I was here.
What's it like up here?
Well, I don't know because we can't leave the dome.
'The atmosphere of Tralfamadore is cyanide.
'It would be fatal to you if you left the dome.'
- This is it?
- I'm afraid so.
- How long will they keep us here?
- I don't know.
'You are here, you have always been here,
'and you will always be here.'
Is he trying to blow my mind?
No, no, no.
It all makes sense in a way.
- You see, in Tralfamadore...
- 'Would you please mate now?'
Look, we're not going to put on a show for you. That's one thing.
Another is, I demand you get
Miss Wildhack some clothing.
'If she's cold, we can always regulate the temperature.'
Now, you get down to Earth and get Miss Wildhack a complete wardrobe, and one that fits!
- What's your size?
- I take a ten.
But then I have to take it in here and let it out a little here so they'll have to bring a needle and thread.
Did you hear that? And remember,
Miss Wildhack is used to the best.
Thanks, uh...
Billy.
Billy.
Now we would like the night canopy.
'Why do you wish the night canopy?'
Because we want it!
- 'Will you mate?'
- We hardly know each other!
Do you mind if we take time to get better acquainted?
'You are acting very unnaturally.'
We would like the night canopy.
'Oh, very well.'
Would you like to sit on the couch?
Where is it?
Here.
Just take my hand.
- Ooh!
- Ooh. Uh, sorry.
Um, that's all right.
Careful.
Get away, Spot.
He's not bothering me. I like dogs.
Come here, Spot.
Come on.
- It's pretty comfortable.
- It's fine.
They got everything from Sears and Roebuck.
I appreciate what you said to them about me.
- Thank you, Miss Wildhack.
- Montana.
Montana.
I don't meet many gentlemen in the entertainment business.
- I'm an optometrist.
- Oh.
Would you like to kiss me?
Yes.
You kiss nicely.
Thank you.
Oh! Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no!
'Mr Pilgrim?
'Miss Wildhack?
'Are you mating now?'
Billy!
Billy, look at this!
Look at this! Perfect.
There's not a chip on it.
It's exactly like the one we had at home.
- The one your son Johnny broke?
- Yeah!
- How'd you know about that?
- The letter you wrote home.
Of course.
It's a miracle, isn't it?
This little dancer survived all this destruction.
Wait till I bring it home.
Can you imagine how Meg's eyes will light up?
Get back to work!
You!
What have you got there?
Oh, uh...
Look at this.
I found this down there.
There's not a chip on it. Pretty, isn't it?
We had one exactly like it.
Used to sit on the living...
Hey, what's the matter?
Feuer!
Stop!
Stop!
Billy.
Billy?
Billy?
Where were you, honey?
Billy, do you like this?
- It's nice.
- It's, uh, not too tight?
A little, maybe.
I'm so big here.
I like it.
That's 'cause you're a man.
I'm gonna have to let it out.
- I really think it looks just...
- Give me something to do.
Oh. You like it too, Spot, huh?
He always growled at my wife.
Do you miss her?
She died.
Somebody smacked into the rear of her car and the exhaust fell off.
She died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Wow. Like what they have out there?
No, that's cyanide.
That's worse.
Oh, wow.
What did you love most about her?
Her pancakes.
If we had a real stove, Billy,
I'd make you an out-of-sight macrobiotic soufflé.
I'd like that.
And then... we could think about having your baby.
Could we have the night canopy, please?
'Oh, Daddy! There is no such planet as Trilaflamaduke!'
Dad, I think what Barbara and I would really like to know...
Would you be willing to see a psychiatrist?
Listen, I have a friend who's not only a doctor but he's interested in outer space.
Why don't the three of us have lunch together today?
I'm not going to commit myself to an institution.
- Dad, I wasn't...
- If it weren't for Tralfamadore,
I might have needed an institution.
I don't need a doctor, Stanley.
On Tralfamadore you learn that the world is just a collection of moments, all strung together in beautiful, random order.
And if we're going to survive, it's up to us to concentrate on the good moments and ignore the bad.
- Besides, I'm in love up there.
- You know, Dad,
I'd really like to have lunch with you today.
I'll be very busy.
Montana's pregnant.
What's her name?
Montana Wildhack.
That's the Hollywood starlet who disappeared, isn't it?
Oh, my God.
Dad!
Hey, wait a minute, Dad.
Dad, listen.
If you go back and forth in time, do you go into the future too?
Mm-hm. Frequently.
Well, I mean, how far do you go?
Do you actually go...?
All the way to my death.
I've seen it many times.
I died in Philadelphia where I was giving a speech on the subject of Tralfamadore.
You see, in Tralfamadore, where I presently dwell, life has no beginning, no middle and no end.
For example, many years ago a man promised to have me killed.
He's an old man now, living not far from here.
He's read all of the publicity associated with my appearance.
He's insane, and tonight he'll keep his promise.
If you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood what I have said.
You see, it's time for you to go home to your wives and children.
It's time for me to be dead for a little while and then live again.
I give you the Tralfamadorian greeting.
Hello.
Farewell.
Hello.
Farewell.
Eternally connected.
Eternally embracing.
Hello.
Farewell.
Nobody fucks around with Paul Lazzaro!
Do you hear me, Pilgrim?
Pilgrim?
Pilgrim?
Hey, Pilgrim!
You hear me?
Pilgrim, get your ass over here and give me a hand!
- What are you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna make a fortune!
Are you kidding?
Haven't you got enough stuff?
What if we get caught?
We ain't gonna get caught.
The Krauts have all left.
If we don't steal it, the Russians will.
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Hey, wait!
Wait! Wait!
I surrender! I surrender!
I surrender!
I surrender!
I don't know. I don't know.
'Billy?
'Billy?
'We just had a baby!'
Billy, we've just had a baby boy!
Look at him!
Isn't he beautiful?
- Ah, yes.
- Isn't he incredibly beautiful?
He's perfect, every bit of him.
- What shall we call him?
- Billy, of course.
Anyway, even if he doesn't look too much like you, he's got your name.
Hello.
Are you hungry?
I think he's hungry now.
Mm-hm.
You hungry? Huh?
Here, here. There it is.
Take it, take it, take it. Ouch!
- (MAN) Good evening.
- I'm Professor Ivarsson.
Yes, Sir Anthony has been expecting you.
It's in your hands, Milo.
- Stand fast. They'll come to terms.
- Very well.
If problems come up, consult with the board.
They know my thinking.
Ah, Professor Ivarsson.
I cannot tell you how grateful I am you've joined me.
I haven't agreed to anything.
Someone woke me up at 6.00 yesterday morning saying he was the
British ambassador.
It was the British ambassador.
He'd arranged my passage on a mail-boat to England, and a large man packed my bags and drove me to the dock.
- Your train leaves in ten minutes.
- Good. Come along, Ivarsson.
But the... Sir Anthony.
Expedition to the Arctic?
I'm hardly a professional explorer.
No, let me finish.
- I've had you looked into.
- Oh.
You're an American from the University of Minnesota, currently a guest lecturer at the University of Christiania.
Your specialty is the archaeology of the North.
In the past, you've led several successful expeditions.
You've done interesting work in Greenland.
Oh, no. You're the right man for the job, all right.
For what job? What's so urgent about it? What is it you hope to find?
My... son.
You see, my wife died when Donald was a child.
I began to groom him to take my place in the business.
I pushed him too hard, I think.
Anyway, we had words.
And suddenly,
Donald dropped everything and went off on a whaling ship as an ordinary seaman.
Three months later, I got word that he'd left the ship in Bathenland.
Why?
I had no idea until I received this from a trading post at Fort Conger on Ellesmere Island.
Donald had left it with the factor for safe keeping when he had gone off on some sort of expedition.
When he didn't come back, the factor sent it on to me.
(IVARSSON) It's an old page from a Hudson's Bay Company journal.
Look at the entry for January 15, 1856.
"To this post, this day came
John Merchison with his Eskimos,
"who hunt the white bear far beyond the land's end.
"He told of seeing a lone cloud, as if lying on the ice,
"and hidden beneath it, an island.
"This island, he sought to examine, but his Eskimos refused him,
"saying it's guarded by evil spirits.
"For it's the place where the whales go to die."
- We're coming into Dover now.
- Thank you.
Sir Anthony, the graveyard of whales is just a fantasy, a whaler's El Dorado, where he thinks he's going to find a fortune in whalebone and ambergris.
Fact is, it simply doesn't exist.
It's a legend, nothing more.
Legend or not, the graveyard is what my son went after.
It's my son I'm looking for.
- (MAN) Quarters?
- Take our luggage to the admiral DPO.
Sir Anthony, I'm afraid this has to be the end of the line for me.
I'd help if I could. I know how much this means to you.
But you're trying the impossible.
To try to find one man with nothing more than a page from a journal...
There is something more.
Donald also left this with the factor.
I was hoping you might know what it was.
Hm. It's a carved bone. It's Eskimo work. It's quite common in the Arctic.
- This one's a map.
- (ANTHONY) Map?
If I had a chart,
I could show you how this works.
My yacht is at the pier.
You can have all the charts you need.
(IVARSSON) This pattern will correspond to part of the shoreline here on the chart.
Look.
See how this matches.
It's not exactly to scale, of course.
(ANTHONY) Then this red mark could be what we're looking for.
If there were such an island.
- Why shouldn't there be?
- There's no land here.
It's just a gigantic frozen sea.
All explorers agree.
Peerey, Nance and all of them.
And what is Ivarsson's opinion?
Of course, there's a lot they haven't covered.
But if there were such an island, if the graveyard of whales really did exist...
The world will never know, will it?
Unless you discover it, or unless someone else beats you to it.
Sir Anthony, you're a devious man.
Yes, I am, aren't I?
I've got your contract here.
Your leave from the university.
Power of attorney. My solicitors will handle your affairs in your absence.
- We're under way.
- And have been for some time.
We'll be in France in the morning.
Why France? That's hardly the most direct route to Fort Conger.
On the contrary.
I think you'll find that it is.
Can't you slow him down?
You'd think we were leaving tomorrow morning.
We are.
What?
I said, we are.
First thing in the morning.
Impossible. It's winter.
No ship can get through the ice before spring.
- I've made other arrangements.
- What arrangements?
If I told you, you'd think I was mad.
Sir Anthony, you are mad.
And now you're gonna meet another mad one. Capt. Brieux!
Ah, Monsieur Ross!
What a pleasure!
He was building this for Americans, but he ran through all their money.
I heard of it and took it over.
- Ah, Capt. Brieux.
- Good evening, Sir Anthony.
- Professor Ivarsson.
- I'm honoured.
- Do you mind if I take a closer look?
- No, please.
I'm proud we'll have you for the ceremony tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
- What ceremony?
- Why, the first flight of my creation.
Tomorrow, the whole world will know of me on my Hyperion.
France will rule the air!
Whatever you planned, cancel it.
Tomorrow, we leave for the Arctic.
The Arctic?
The Arctic?
Sir Anthony, that's ridiculous!
It can't be done.
That's impossible.
We would need food, supplies, fuel for the motors.
The fuel, I'll leave to you, Captain.
All other necessities have been amply provided by my staff.
I think it is best that we have an understanding.
We have an understanding.
I bought and paid for your airship.
It's mine.
I intend to use it to find my son, who is lost in the Arctic.
But I cannot do it without your help.
I can offer you nothing except hardship and danger, except your place in history.
- History?
- Think of it, Captain.
You have an opportunity which comes but once in a generation.
The world will know you not only as the first man to fly over the Arctic, but the first man, perhaps, to brave the North Pole itself.
Today, we make history.
There should be flags, music, a speech from the president.
But what do we have?
Two children and a herd of goats.
When you bring her back to France, the celebration's gonna break all records.
- We are ready to depart.
- Very good, carry on.
Silence!
There will be no speaking.
Well, we are on our way.
A glorious day, Monsieur.
We rise with the sun.
Congratulations, Captain.
This will be a morning to remember.
Something in the food hamper just bit me.
That is not the food hamper, that is the small boudoir of Josephine.
It's some kind of a dog.
Of course, the best kind: French.
I am not interested in its nationality.
- Who brought it aboard?
- No one brought her aboard.
She lives here. This is her home since the airship was begun.
(ANTHONY) I'm not running some kind of flying kennel.
Get rid of it.
Very well, if you wish, Monsieur.
Of course, it will take time.
The sun has warmed the gas.
We must wait until night to return to the hangar.
- Then bring back the ground crew.
- Wait until night?
That will mean 12 hours.
I can't lose the time.
You're absolutely right, Sir Anthony.
Congratulations, Josephine.
We've signed on our ship's mascot.
Very well, but I don't like small dogs, and I never did.
Britain may rule the waves,
Sir Anthony, but the French airship rules the sky.
Already, we are speeding in triumph across the shores of your homeland.
It's raining as usual, I see.
- How far have we come?
- About 150 miles.
Hundred and fifty? In six hours?
Is that what you call
"speeding in triumph"?
We'll travel faster, but now my motors are at half-speed.
What on earth for?
Damn you!
- They must run themselves in.
- Poppycock!
I want full speed!
There are the controls.
If you want full speed, it is your responsibility, not mine.
What do you say now, Sir Anthony?
I say, I want full speed.
And I mean to have it.
You have your wish, Monsieur.
It's on your head.
- What's happening?
- Somebody route the propeller.
I followed your orders, Monsieur, and you see the result.
Now we must go back to France for repairs.
We will not.
We will proceed on one propeller.
The Arctic winds!
That would be insanity!
Without full power, my airship could not survive.
- I refuse to go forward.
- And I refuse to go back.
Well, gentlemen, we have to go somewhere.
Captain, you carry a spare propeller, don't you?
- That is right.
- Well, why don't we put it on now.
- In midair?
- Mm-hm.
- Impossible!
- Nothing's impossible.
Splendid idea, Ivarsson.
Come along. Give me a hand.
Sir Anthony!
May I remind you that I am in command here!
Only an idiot would attempt such a thing.
I will do it myself.
Do be careful and don't take any unnecessary risks.
Take good care.
The wind's coming up.
Let's haul him up.
Well done, Captain.
My congratulations.
Thank you, Sir Anthony.
I am deeply honoured.
What's he up to now?
Vive le France!
Top fellow, Brieux.
- The man's incredible.
- Brave, but mad as a hatter.
Musk ox.
Over there.
What are they doing?
They're forming a defensive ring.
They think we are attacking.
Captain, is it really necessary to fly so low?
It's easier to control the airship at this altitude.
No need to be alarmed, Sir Anthony.
Look, I'm in full command.
You made your point, Captain.
There's no need to overdo it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Take hold of the lines.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Now, what I don't understand is, why
Donald took only one Eskimo with him.
Only one could be persuaded to go.
They all knew what he was looking for.
The mythical island, where the whales go to die.
One man's myth is another man's gospel, Mr Ivarsson.
Anyway, the Eskimos believe the island exists.
They're frightened to death of it.
Say it's guarded by evil spirits.
What about the Eskimo who went with him?
Oomiak's his name.
They call him "The Fearless One".
Though he was far from fearless when he came back.
- He came back.
- (MAN) Aye.
That's him out there.
Showing the captain how to fly his airship.
Fetch the fellow. Call him in.
I'm afraid you won't get anything out of him.
Call him in at once. Don't argue.
Very well, Sir.
Any man that goes off with my son and comes back alone...
- I'll see that he talks, all right.
- You'd better let me handle him.
You've never dealt with Eskimos.
They have a diplomacy all their own.
Blasted.
Why doesn't anyone think I have tact?
Come along, Oomiak.
Ah, so there you are.
What I want is an exact account of everything that happened...
Sir Anthony, this is the great Oomiak.
Who knows Oomiak?
Your fame has travelled far.
What fame?
Not even my dogs know me.
You were my son's guide.
What happened to him?
Who?
This is the father of Donald Ross.
We wanna know about your trip...
Tell us what happened when you left here to find the island.
- Island?
- Don't try to play that game with me.
Oomiak, I think you've seen this before.
This is where the whales go to die.
It's the island Donald was looking for.
Well, speak up, man.
My mind forgets.
Is The Fearless One afraid to help us?
We travelled many days.
Evil spirits watch us when we find island.
They make big blizzard.
Pshh.
Then they attack us.
I fight like bear. Ah!
Fight like bear, but evil spirits too strong!
So you ran away and left my son?
No, we both run, blind in snow.
When blizzard stop,
I search for many hours.
No Donald.
I tell truth.
You, Donald's father.
I, Donald's friend.
- His whole story is a pack of lies.
- Maybe.
But he's the only chance we have.
He could show us where he lost him and start searching there.
I don't suppose there's any chance he'd go.
No, Sir, none at all.
Nothing on earth would make him go back.
Nothing on earth.
Why don't you let one of them on.
He can tell the others about it.
- No. You let one aboard...
- What about this fellow?
He's been a great help. Would you like to see the inside of the airship?
Me?
- Yes, I like.
- (ANTHONY) Good man.
Give him a hand, Captain.
Why don't you show him around.
- Perhaps we can win him over.
- Well, we can try.
Captain, a word with you.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Captain?
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
No, no, no, Monsieur.
Quite impossible.
There is no room, and we are overloaded now.
We could leave the mechanic.
Pick him up on the way back.
You ask me to fly without the mechanic?
But you have me.
Just tell me what to do.
I could, but you wouldn't do it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like we're ready to leave.
I better take you down.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Let go the lines there.
Wait, Oomiak's still onboard.
Hang it all, he's the only one who knows where Donald went to.
We could bring him back after he's helped us to find him.
Sir Anthony, since
I no longer have a mechanic, may I suggest that you first make fast the door, then go aloft and take in the landing lines.
Aye, aye, Captain.
We're here.
We can only guess how far the island is.
This Eskimo map is a little vague.
(ANTHONY) It's a lot to gamble on a piece of bone.
He's not much help to us either.
Did you expect him to be?
- (IVARSSON) Sir Anthony.
- Yes?
(IVARSSON) Come up, please.
There's been a report.
- (ANTHONY) What is it?
- Look over there.
- Whales.
- White whales.
Beluga. Indigenous to the Arctic.
Now look over there.
I say, that one's quite different.
The California grey. It's supposed to be found only in the Pacific.
A narwhal, the unicorn of the sea.
That's a rare sight, Sir Anthony.
By Jove, there are whales everywhere.
All kinds of whales.
And all moving in the same direction.
Exactly.
So there is a place where whales go to die.
Captain, that big lead of open water.
Follow it.
If we are on the right track, we'd have seen something.
Look. You remember the journal?
"A lone cloud, as if lying on the ice."
Oomiak.
Is that where the island is?
Wrong way. Wrong way.
Island not that way.
Island back this way.
- He told us what we wanted to know.
- Yes.
Steady as you go, Captain.
Look.
And hidden beneath the cloud, an island.
Captain. What happened?
Captain.
Captain, why are we stopping?
In such a cloud, it's not safe to proceed.
Not safe? What do you mean?
I could not see to navigate, and there will be strong winds.
My airship could be dashed against hidden cliffs and torn apart.
- We can't turn back now.
- We don't have to.
- We can go in on foot.
- Oh.
Capital idea!
Take the ship down to the ice.
- I'll get everything ready.
- No, no. You cannot leave the ship!
Professor, you know the dangers that lie below.
Even if you survive the cold, there are still the cliffs.
- You could not climb the cliffs.
- We must try, Captain.
I know. It's a gamble, Captain.
But with my son's life at stake,
I have no choice.
No, Sir Anthony, it is I who have no choice.
I'm not a man of stone.
There are times when the heart must rule the head.
We will attack the cloud.
- Maybe we can go above them.
- Impossible.
- Our load is too heavy.
- We'll assume lightweight.
Hurry up! We are losing height.
- You all right?
- Yes, quite.
I can't help thinking of the captain.
Poor fellow.
- How long must we keep this up?
- We can't survive in the open.
We've gotta keep moving until we find shelter.
There should be caves in those mountains.
Oomiak, is this anything like the place that you and Donald came to?
I tell you, Donald's father, we see nothing in blizzard.
Then spirits come and...
And you fought like a bear.
Yes, you mentioned that.
- Somebody watches.
- Where?
I don't see.
I feel.
Tommyrot.
Something moved.
- Did you see anything?
- I don't think so.
Neither did I.
I think we should head in that direction.
Oh, very well.
If you don't know where you're going, one way's as good as another.
It's incredible.
- I don't believe it.
- (ANTHONY) Green and fertile.
In all this ice and snow.
Look. There's the explanation.
The island must be volcanic.
Heat rising through fissures in the ground.
It's probably thermal springs.
Exactly like parts of Iceland.
There are buildings down there.
- (IVARSSON) Looks like a settlement.
- People. There are people there.
That means that Donald could be there.
The spirit! The spirit!
Wait a minute.
No, wait. We're friends.
Do you understand their language?
It's Norse.
The Old Norse of the sagas.
Their weapons, their clothes, their appearance.
- They're Vikings.
- Vikings?
They think we're invaders, come to take over their land.
- The three of us?
- No.
They think we're the first and thousands more will follow.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Talk to them.
Explain why we're here.
I'll try, but I've never spoken
Old Norse, only read it.
Donald?
That's it. Donald Ross.
Where is he?
Tell them I'm his father.
What is it? What's going on?
He understood me.
But he's going to sound an alarm to stir up the countryside.
We're to be kept under close guard.
Well, that's not good.
If they think we're invaders, then Donald could have been a prisoner all these months.
Make them tell us where he is.
Oomiak, no!
Idiot.
He might have got us all killed.
But he does fight like a bear.
He says you saved his life.
Well, I'm glad he appreciates it.
But tell him I don't want anything to happen to Oomiak.
Thank you.
He says your son is here and well.
He's living with the family of the man who found him after the great blizzard.
I knew it. I knew he was safe.
- (ANTHONY) What's happening?
- We're stopping to eat.
We just had a talk with our friend and found out why they're so panicky about invaders.
Oh? Why?
These people have been here for centuries.
They're descendants of some early Viking expedition.
We've actually discovered a lost colony.
That's quite remarkable.
They've been so isolated up here they believe that the rest of the world is a frozen wilderness of ice and snow.
How very odd.
- None of them ever left the island.
- They have no reason to.
They call this island Astragard and believe it to be the garden of the gods.
Perfect and unique in a desolate world and set aside for them alone. Forever.
- Why do they feel invaded?
- Because they have a prophecy.
There'll be a day when the barbarians will try to conquer their paradise.
Mm.
So that explains it.
They think that we're the savages who've come to destroy them.
Could be a bit tricky.
As soon as I get to their headman,
I'll straighten things out.
(IVARSSON) Reindeer.
Probably serve them as cattle.
That's the house where Donald's living.
Donald is there? Well, come on!
My son.
I haven't seen him for two years.
Tell them, Ivarsson.
I'll go with them, but not until I've seen my son.
Thank you, my boy.
Very decent of you.
They don't look happy to see us.
That hunter stirred them up.
I don't see Donald amongst them.
Thank you, Sir.
Donald, Donald Ross.
Where is he? Can you tell us?
Ask him about Donald.
Is it true you are Donald's father?
Good heavens, you speak English!
Donald taught me.
He lives with us since he came to our land.
This is my father.
I'm grateful to you for looking after my son.
Where is he now?
He wants us to go in the house.
We cannot talk here.
Oh, very well. Thank you.
So, what do you mean, they took Donald away?
Who took him?
The Godi's men.
They came with weapons.
The Godi's their high priest.
It was because of the hunter.
He rode down from the mountain, shouting of invaders.
- It was that fellow on the horse.
- Yes.
When The Godi heard, he sounded the long horn.
The long horn is their call to battle.
Battle? What battle?
What has this to do with Donald?
When it was told that one of the invaders was Donald's father,
The Godi said Donald was a spy who came here to betray us to the enemy.
- Surely you don't believe that.
- We don't.
Because we know Donald.
There were many that did believe because there was an omen in the sky.
Omen?
Like a whale, but bigger many times.
My dear girl, that's easily explained.
What the people saw was my airship.
You see, it's like...
It...
It's like one of your boats.
Only it sails in the air.
If I could just talk to this Godi,
I could explain everything.
We're to be taken before the council.
Erik's a member.
You'll get your chance to be heard.
That girl, she speaks better English than Oomiak.
She's prettier too.
If she learned it from Donald, he must have spent a lot of time in her company.
Can you blame him?
I can't say I do, no.
This is like an archaeologist's dream.
To go back in history and walk the earth as it was ten centuries ago.
I suggest you forget the past and start thinking about the future, which from the look of things,
I'd say is not very promising.
The clothes, the weapons, each one of them could be a museum piece.
That's what I don't like.
Those museum pieces.
Look at that.
A Viking longship, exactly the way they were built 1,000 years ago.
Poor fellow.
And it's all my fault.
The temple, that's where we're gonna meet the council.
Ah. Good.
"Go straight to the top," I always say.
Odin, Thor and Freyja.
The greatest of all the Viking gods.
I hope they're on our side.
We may need all the help we can get.
A Viking council.
Straight out of a history book.
There's the girl's father.
He seems a sensible old fellow.
(IVARSSON) They probably call the one with the staff "The Lawspeaker".
They all look reasonable enough.
They might be my board of directors if it weren't for their outlandish costumes.
He said, "Bring out the other prisoner."
- Donald!
- Father!
That's my son!
I've been looking for you.
I thought you might.
It's my son.
- John Ivarsson.
- (IVARSSON) Donald.
- How do you do?
- He's keen on the past. Archaeology.
Sorry about all this.
It's a bit sticky here, I'm afraid.
He says that when I came to this land,
I gave my oath that I came alone and in peace.
But now come others, and with them, an evil omen in the sky
- that cannot be ignored.
- That's my confounded airship.
Let them speak before they are judged.
That is precisely what I wanted to do.
- Father.
- I'll handle this.
You just translate for me.
- What do they call this island?
- Astragard. But, Father...
Shh, shh.
Honoured council of Astragard,
I come to your beautiful country as a friend...
...in peace,
- (SPEAKS IN OLD NORSE)
(ANTHONY) seeking only my son, who was lost to me.
The Godi.
He's telling them not to listen to our lies.
It's obvious that we're barbarians who covet their sacred lands.
And we must be condemned at once.
And without a hearing.
Now look here, I thought
I explained to you...
It is no longer a matter for the council, for the gods have spoken.
If these men are spared, more will come in armed hordes to pillage and profane our sacred land.
There can be but one penalty for the invaders: Death.
(CROWD CHANTING
IN OLD NORSE)
Quite a sendoff.
Full Viking honour.
All very authentic.
Very final.
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Nonsense, my boy.
Donald.
(DONALD) Freyja.
We're in your debt, young lady.
Here they come.
And pull.
The shore. It's our only chance.
You stay here. I will draw them away.
- No, you won't. It's too dangerous.
- He's right, my dear.
It's you they're after, not me.
There is a hunter's cave. Up there.
With food and clothing.
I'll be back when it's safe.
Freyja.
Here they come.
- I think she's done it. Good girl.
- I should never have let her go.
- If they catch her...
- Don't worry, my boy.
- She knows what she's doing.
- Let's find that cave.
Hello.
Oomiak! My dear old friend!
I'm so glad to see you!
- We all are.
- We thought we'd lost you.
You can't kill Oomiak. I hide in water.
Swim like white bear.
Good, good, but let's go.
- What now?
- There's still nothing.
Oh, Ivarsson's up above, scouting around.
Right.
- Morning, Father.
- Hmm? Morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Wretchedly.
You must be a bit done in yourself.
I'm worried about Freyja.
So am I, my boy. So am I.
Well, I've made a mess of it, haven't I?
Of what?
The whole miserable thing, all this nightmare we're living in.
It's all my fault. Every bit of it.
Your fault? Why?
I'm the one who ran off chasing rainbows.
- You're not responsible for that.
- I am.
Right from the beginning.
I was always trying to shape you into my mould.
Bullying, badgering, never letting up.
If I hadn't driven you away, none of this would've happened.
Father, you didn't drive me.
Donald, I rode an airship across the top of the world to tell you this.
If we get out of this, you can do anything you want to do.
You'll be free of me, I promise you.
I don't want to be free of you.
I never did.
I came here looking for adventure.
And I certainly found that.
But I don't belong here.
Now, when we get out of this, and we will, I'm coming home with you.
I want to share in your work and your responsibilities.
If you'll let me.
If I'll let you?
You won't regret it.
I'll see to that.
- (FREYJA) Donald?
- Freyja!
He was quite worried about you.
I went back to the farm.
It'll be just as we arranged.
Father will give us dogs and a sled.
What had you arranged?
For some time, Freyja and I had been planning to leave the island.
We hope to reach Fort Conger.
The two of you, together?
You think I'd leave her behind?
Not if you're your father's son, no.
Boats, they come.
What do we do now?
There's not much cover, but we can get to the top without being seen.
That settles it.
We can't stay here. Those hounds would find us in no time.
Look, The Godi's joined us.
Bloodthirsty pounder.
Come on, everybody. Up we go.
They go. They go!
- (DONALD) They've given up!
- Thank heavens for that.
Look out, Father!
Clumsy of me.
Now the wolves are after us again.
Afraid so, Father.
It's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.
- (ANTHONY) Nasty sort of place.
- Oomiak, go watch below.
- We need somewhere to hide.
- But where? They know this island.
- The Bay of Whales.
- Donald!
It's over there, to the south.
It's sacred, taboo.
The Vikings won't go near it.
That's it, then. Let's go!
No, Donald, please.
- The spirits.
- (DONALD) Freyja, believe me.
- What is it?
- The spirits are good spirits.
Didn't they protect your people when they first came here?
- Surely they'll protect us.
- (OOMIAK) They come. We go.
Freyja, trust me.
Come on up.
Oddly enough, they say this sulphur's good for the lungs.
Sir Anthony, this is hardly the time to rest.
I only hope we soon find that blasted Bay of Whales.
Come on.
My father.
Father!
Burning one minute, freezing the next.
A man could catch his death.
Well, that's what's so interesting about the Arctic. It's a contradiction.
- In my first expedition to Bathenland...
- Ivarsson, please. Stop!
What we need is a conference.
Conference? About what, Father?
If we find the Bay of Whales and if it's true The Godi won't follow us there, what do we do then?
We lie low.
Make our way across the mountains to Freyja's farm.
- We can't go back through that.
- No, no. We find iceboat. Float.
- Very good.
- (ANTHONY) Boat?
What's he talking about?
He wants to find a piece of pack ice and float around the mountain.
Preposterous.
Where the whales go to die.
All those great creatures from every sea, lying there, from the beginning of time.
Just look at all that whalebone.
Worth millions of pounds.
And heaven knows what price the ambergris would fetch.
All that doesn't matter now, does it, Father?
Freyja, don't be afraid.
Think of the saga.
Doesn't it tell how, long ago, it was the whales that led your people here?
Where they found peace and happiness, so there's nothing to fear.
Believe me.
We need iceboat.
How we get down there?
Yes, how?
Not down these cliffs, obviously.
There must be a way.
The Vikings found one.
Is it in the saga?
Does it tell how they came up?
With the help of the gods.
It is told that he came through the mouth of hell.
- That's not very explicit, I'm afraid.
- Wait a minute.
That volcano in Iceland, Mount Hekla.
The early Christians believed that was the entrance to hell.
- What?
- Entrance.
It's a wild thought. Come on.
- The crater of a dead volcano.
- Quiet.
You hear that? Down there, there's an underground river.
The river flows to the sea, which means there is a passage from the crater to the bay.
Ho, ho.
Come on.
Look, the water's running out.
- Come on.
- (ANTHONY) Where to?
Wherever the water went.
Look!
Do not worry.
I have sailed this way many times.
It's not this I'm worried about.
It's them.
Will they never give up?
I can't understand why the bowmen haven't been shooting.
They do not have to.
- They only wait to see us die.
- Freyja.
It's taught in the sagas that the bay is guarded by sea beasts.
We cannot escape.
- Killer whales.
- (ANTHONY) What do we do now?
Anything we can.
Here comes the other one.
Hold on, everybody!
The Hyperion!
And heaven be praised, our old friend the captain.
(ANTHONY) My compliments,
Captain. You keep an excellent table.
And you're an excellent shot.
You saved our lives.
- Thank you.
- An unexpected pleasure.
Since I landed two days ago,
I've been trying to save my own.
But getting out of here, that's going to be quite a problem.
- Isn't it, Captain?
- I have the solution.
My ship may be battered and torn, but the mind that conceived it, that still functions.
As you see, the ship has lost much gas, but it retains some buoyancy.
So if we reduce sufficiently the weight, then it will rise.
How would you reduce the weight?
Abandon the motors.
The propellers are broken anyway.
The gondola too.
Strip the ship of everything that weights it down.
What have we then?
- A free balloon.
- By Jove!
- It'd carry us across the bay.
- If we can reach the pack ice...
We shall go farther than that.
The prevailing wind is to the south.
If it holds, we should drift to Greenland.
When we reach the coast, we descend and proceed on foot to the nearest habitation.
Capt. Brieux, you are a very remarkable man.
I've always felt so.
- Sir Anthony.
- This is a bit much, isn't it?
Hardly the time for ceremonies.
Let's be off.
Please, Sir Anthony, this is a moment to be savoured.
Once more, we stand on the threshold of a great adventure.
To my Hyperion.
May she rise.
Like a phoenix from the ashes of despair.
And soar like Man's imagination to Greenland and beyond.
The Hyperion.
- Now, let's get going, shall we?
- (BRIEUX) Of course, Monsieur.
I will show you now the ingenious arrangements
I've made for our departure.
Perhaps you have observed that I've cut loose the gondola.
The ship is now attached to it by a single cable.
So also the motors and the tail.
This section, too, linked to the ship only by a cable.
When I slip these cables, the gondola, the motors and the tail detach themselves, and we rise.
Are you sure?
You will see.
Now, gentlemen, if you will assist me.
The gondola.
The motors and the tail.
When I say three, pull with all your force.
Right.
- Permission to proceed, Monsieur?
- What?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, proceed.
Very well.
One...
...two...
...three!
Well, Sir Anthony.
It worked perfectly.
Once again, Captain,
I underestimated you.
I'm turning in. I haven't had a good night's sleep since England.
- Sir Anthony.
- Hmm?
Take a look.
Campfires.
So they're still waiting for us.
It's a pity we'll have to disappoint them.
What is it?
You look frightened.
- A little.
- No, you mustn't be. It's all over.
We're safe now.
I know.
It is not that.
What, then?
It is the world beyond our mountains, your world.
Our world isn't really so different.
It's bigger, and everything moves faster.
We live by clocks and machines instead of tides and seasons.
You'll get used to it.
And be happy.
Because you'll be surrounded by people you love and who love you.
I wish my father could be with us.
I know.
But his home is Astragard.
His heart will always be here.
Mine is with you.
Ivarsson.
When does the first ship leave Greenland in the spring?
Usually, the beginning of April.
So with luck, we should be back in England in about six weeks.
I should not count on it, Monsieur.
The wind has changed.
We are drifting back to the land.
Well, can't something be done?
I cannot command the wind, Monsieur.
- We're rising.
- Got draft.
The wind against the cliffs.
What happens when we get to the top?
Everybody out. Quick.
It's true that the gods were angry, but it was The Godi who did wrong by leading the people to hatred and to violence.
I'm glad they recognise that.
The prisoners may go in peace on this condition, that they swear a sacred oath.
Never to reveal the existence of this sacred island.
That's fair enough.
To ensure that the oath be honoured for all time, we must demand one thing.
Well, go on. What is it?
That you leave a hostage here.
Your son.
I refuse to discuss it any further.
How could they imagine
I would leave you behind?
- Those are their terms!
- I will not permit it.
Without a hostage, none of us will leave.
- Blasted! Then I'll be the hostage.
- (IVARSSON) I don't think so.
As a matter of fact, everything's already been arranged.
And very satisfactorily for everybody, I think.
Are you sure it's what you want?
Are you sure you want to be left behind?
Yes, I'm sure.
This is a chance no archaeologist could turn down.
Not only to study the past, but to relive it. Here it all is.
Hidden behind mist for 1,000 years, and I haven't scratched the surface.
Besides, who says
I'm being left behind?
We archaeologists take a longer view.
Whole civilisations have vanished before, you know.
The day may come when this might be Man's last refuge.
Good luck.
Goodbye, my friends!

Ladies and gentlemen!
200 motels
200 motels . . . Life on the road!
Ladies and gentlemen! and here is . . .
Who?
Larry the dwarf!
Larry likes to dress up funny
Tonight he's dressed up like Frank Zappa
Let's ask him "What's the deal?"
Hi Larry, it's good to have you back on our panel.
Hi Dave, it's really great to be back on your panel.
I'm sure the people at home would be interested to know why such a large dwarf as you is all dressed up like Frank Zappa.
Tell us Larry, eh . . . what's the deal?
He made me do it, Dave. He's such a creep.
He's making me hold this alladin.
And why is he making you do that, Larry?
He wants me to fuck the girl with the harp.
He wants you to fuck the girl . . . with the harp?
No, no, with the magic lamp. He wants me to stuff it up her and rub it.
Hm. Hm-hm-hm. Ho-ho-ho, ha-ha. A-HA-HA-HA-HO-HO.
Let's ask our studio audience. If you'd just been lowered down here on TV by a wire connected to a brown leather harness, forced by a crazy person to insert a mysterious, imported lamp into the reproductive-rep-rep-rep into-into the rep-rep-reproductive orifice of a lady harpist and you were a dwarf . . . would you do it?
YES!!!
Yay!
Let's spin the big wheel, Larry! Go ahead, give it a whirl!
What our studio audience doesn't know is that the reason Larry the Dwarf is doing all this stuff is because its all part of the score to 200 Motels. Every word, every action, the lamp, the reproductive orifice, it's all in the score, so he has to do it. This whole event is a fantasy that occurred touring on the road. Touring can make you crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
That is precisely what 200 Motels is all about.
Say!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
How long?
How long?
Till that mystery roach be arrivin' soon
Ya-ooo Ya-ooo Ya-ooo Ya-ooo
That mystery roach be approachin'
That mystery roach be approachin' me
La La La La La La La, Oof!
How long?
How long?
Till that mystery roach been gone
Ya-ooo-ooo-oo-ooo
Ya-ooo-ooo-oo-ooo
That mystery roach be approachin'
That mystery roach be approachin' me
La La La La La La La, Oof!
That mystery roach be approachin'
That mystery roach be approachin' me
La La La La La La La, Oof!

Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!

Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!

Room service?
Ah . . . a mystery roach . . .
What are we SINGING about?
We must be . . . FLIPPING OUT!
Special delivery for Mr. Volman! Mr. Volman?
Are you Volman?
It's a double cheeseburger from a famous American burger chain, with a symbol in the parking lot that's yellow plastic and goes like this:
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
. . . In a steaming briefcase!
You're Volman!
Yeh-No. No. He's Volman. Who are you?
You must call me "Rance Muhammitz."
"Rance Muhammitz"? Stupidest name I ever heard of.
Yah, but you must remember that within the conceptual framework of this filmic event, nothing really matters! It is entirely possible for several subjective realities to coexist. It is possible that all things are a deception of the senses.
Right on, Rance! The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake, artifical food coloring.
By the way. Mr. Volman, I have . . . YOUR CHEESEBURGER.
We must evolve.
Yeah . . .
We must progress.
Progress . . .
There must be growth!
Yeah . . . macrobiotic foods and tie-dye shirts!
Hey, ya ain't gonna eat that cheeseburger, Mark? . . . (BURP)
Fucking guy will eat anything.
This is registered delivery, you will have to sign for it.
Sure man, I'll sign. Where's the pencil?
I don't wish to alarm you, my son, but the signature will have to be . . . in blood.
Listen man, I just wanna know two things. Is there any beer in this fake nightclub, and when do we get paid?
Just-just a minute, just a minute, in a moment or two you'll be able to get your hands on all the imaginary beer that you want. For the moment, I would like to explain some of the things that you'll all be doing in this movie.
I've been wondering about that.
For Sherwood, we have a vacuum cleaner scheduled . . .
A vacuum cleaner?
. . . and a potential epileptic seizure during a production number later on.
A vacuum cleaner!
I thought the two of you would like to get acquainted.
It says here that you are supposed to be in love.
This abnormal relationship will be great for the big story I'm going to write!
Listen man, I just wanna know one thing: when do we get paid?
No look, look, look, look, look, don't you even care what you do?
So long as I get some beer and I get paid, you can make me do anything, I'm professional!
You should be careful talkin' about that stuff.
Why, does he listen?
He always listens. He always watches and listens to all the guys in the band. I've been in the band for years, and I know. He always listens.
That's how he gets all his material! It isn't s'posed to be natural, friendly, good-natured, humorous, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, YEAH, WELL FINE!
. . . and then he rips it off, and he sneaks off into a secret room someplace, and boils it in ammonia, and he gets it perverted, and THEN he brings it back to us at rehearsal and makes us play it!
Hey man, what's that over there?
It's HIM. You can see him, he's watching.
D'ya think he heard us?
I've been in the band for years. You can bet that he heard everything.
Yeah, let's go over and pretend to be nice to him.
Yeah, let's go over and pretent we don't know he's watching.
Yeah, and rippin' off all our good material.
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hey, Frank!
Hey, that's a GREAT new song you wrote, you know, the one about the penis and everything? I was laughin' a lot the whole time I was learnin' it!
Yeah, we were all laughin', Frank!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha YEAH, WELL FINE!
Yeah, it took a little while to get into it man, but once we got the drift, phew!
Yeah, there's lots of great parts you've got in there for the chorus, you know when they go:
RAN-TAN-RAN-TOON-RAN-TAN-TAN . . .
And I steal the room and everything, you know. I don't even mind you rippin' it off from me, just as long as I get paid.
Oh, and I don't even mind the part where he says, "what can I say about this fabulous elixir," so long as me and
Howard and Jeff Simmons who left the group just before the movie started get credit for special material! Ha-ha-ha!
I'm deeply offended by your lack of artistic sense.
Look here, Muhammitz, or whatever the fuck they call ya, I don't even give a shit man, I got five fuckin' kids at home and . . . can you lend me a coupla bucks until the end of the week? Who are you, anyway?
Oh, she writes for the Imaginary Rock and Roll newspaper in San Francisco.
San Francisco?
Man!
Oh! Eh, he's making me leave here now.
I'll see you later when we play.
What?
I don't expect you to understand that, because uh, we haven't formed the group yet.
Ah, Mark will play the bass . . .
Ba-doom-doom-doom-doom . . .
Howie will sing and play sax . . .
Dwee-dat-dwee-dat-dweet-dat-dwee-dat . . .
I'll play the guitar . . . woop-doo-doo-doo . . . and the dwarf here will play drums!
Waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit! This guy isn't even a dwarf!
That's one of the reasons the group will be so commercial!
Ah. What about the other guys?
Ah, they're already forming groups all over the place! Why wait till the end of the movie, we could have a hit single right now!
He's right, he's right! We don't need Aynsley . . .
No . . . We don't need Ian . . .
No . . . We don't need George!
No! We don't need anybody! Argh!
No!
He needs us, remember. We don't need him! All those other guys are too old for rock. They're out of it! We could have a tight little heavy little band with this dwarf here. You know, that he, he used to play drums for Leon Russell . . .
Ohh . . .
Listen, you're right. Zappa's 30.
Yeah, man.
Ohh . . . whew . . .
Thirty years old . . .
Oh, he's out of it man! He's too old, he should retire.
Yeah, really. You can't trust old people. You know, we should take up a collection and buy him a watch.
I don't know too much about this stuff
I've been a little busy
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
Just a few questions
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
I hear birds!
What's he saying?
You took the mystery burger! You are in full posession of
. . . the burger! Do you know who I am? Hm? Do you know
Who I really am?
Really man! WHO . . . DO YOU THINK . . . YOU ARE?
Yeah, do you want me to tell you WHO . . .
I really think you are?
Yeah, somebody tell me WHO is this guy?
Centerville
A real nice place to raise your kids up
Centerville
It's really neat!
Churches
Churches
And liquor stores
Oh, yeah! It's
Just like Glendale
Look!
Over there
It's a rancid boutique!
Janet, did you see those guys with the hair?
It's those guys from the fake stage across the street from our house.
Eww, I get so excited when someone from a group gets near me. I just . . . eww, I just . . .
Don't you have any taste? That one guy's got gray hair, and the other one's too fat.
Oh, they look so lonely.
Lonely? Good evening honey, they look desperate. Desperate pop stars are so depressing when they've been on the road for such a long time, and they finally get some action.
They drool on you.
Really. All that stuff that comes out of their mouth when they're on top of you. It's so moche. Ew.
Ew, on the pillows.
But I like the drummer with the rivets on his clothes, he's not bad.
Yeah, I've seen him too. He just screams
"Englishness," with that little haircut and the rings . . .
And the binoculars.
Binoculars?
Didn't you notice his binoculars?
No, he's got binoculars?
He watches us through them, he's a pervert!
Oh, I get so hot just thinking about perversions . . . Maybe when we go down to the fake nightclub tonight we can meet him, and find out if he really is perverted.
Just take my word for it; he is perverted.
Mmm. And English, too.
They're all that way.

Kick him again in the head, boys!
Kick him again in the head, now!
KICK HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD!

On this here waitress . . .
Yodel-oh-oo-pee-yeh
Yodel-oh-oo-pee!
(HE'S LONESOME COWBOY BURT,
A--don'tcha get his feelin's hurt)
Yeah . . . but come on in this place,
An' I'll buy you a taste,
'N you can sit on my face--
Where's my waitress?
OPAL, YOU HOT LITTLE BITCH!
Yes, Jimmy Carl Black, Indian of the Group, what can I do for you?
Mo-honnitz! What are you doin' here?
You just called me, didn't you?
All I said was "Opal, you hot little bitch".
I am known by many names.
Mm-hmm. You got many friends who call you
"Opal the hot little bitch"?
Please-please-please-please Mr. Black, let us cut the small talk, and get on with your briefing.
Fine, you can brief me all you want as long as you can tell me two things . . .
I know, when do we get paid . . .
No, I wanna know where's that waitress,
Yes, waitress..
And if she comes in this place, will she sit on my face, and loan me a couple bucks until the end of the week.
. . . couple of bucks . . . . end of the week . . . week . . . week ending, the week ending, what-what that, what's the date?
Uhhh, Tuesday was the 5th, uh Monday was the 3rd, uh make that out for Sunday-
Eh-eh-eh, don't say Sunday!
What's wrong with Sunday?
Eh!
The Lord's day! Br-r-r! A day of rest! Br-r-r! Just make that sucker out for the 23rd of March, wouldya?
Very well, Mr. Black. Oh, by the way. I have here the special beer I promised you earlier.
Oh man, it's about time, I've been waiting.
Would you care to sign for it?
This is a pencil?
No, Mr. Black, it is a pin.
A PIN?
Would you jab yourself in the finger with it?
Listen, Mo-hannitz, I may be professional, but I'm not THAT professional. I just want my beer.
Sign first! In blood.
Fuck you! Who do you think you are, the devil or something?
I am known by many names.
You probably got some more weird names for yourself, but I'll tell you one thing you ain't nev-, definitely ain't never gonna be called and that's the devil, because you ain't the devil.
Oh, I'm not?
You bet your sweet ass you're not. The fuckin' devil's got an english accent.
I seen him three weeks ago on TV. So you know, you can just take this big needle here and hang it in your ass as far as I'm concerned! (cough) Fuckin' guy musta been a communist!
Hello there. When you go on tour with a musical group, it's possible that any town can seem like this.
Whether it's large or small, or busy, or if there's nothing happening in it.
The reason for this is quite simple. A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent god-fearing citizen, and the life he leads, in many ways, seems useless and irrelevant to those of us who'd prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer. Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people. Many of them study for years, learning to play the violin for instance, only to be rewarded with a humdrum job in the fourth row of a symphonic string section.
That's why the governments have constructed, at great expense, this experimental reorientation facility.
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless old musicians with their brown fiddles and little horns.
Give them a trade! A reason to exist in the modern world! A chance of a happier, more productive life.
Some will enter the military, some will learn shorthand, and some will disappear in the middle of the night on a special train they're sending in.
It's the only way, really, to bring about the final solution to the orchestra question.
I'm sure that many of us realize that a pop group can earn a vast amount of money compared to these other kinds of musicians. That's why the special government agencies for mass response programming and psychological stultification prefer to treat them in a more subtle manner.
They know, just as many of you vigilant and thoroughly upstanding citizens have discovered for yourselves, the power of pop music to corrupt and putrify the minds of world youth are virtually limitless.
Ooh, the way you love me, lady,
I get so hard now I could die

Well, there are a lot of reasons why I'd . . . I'd drag a girl such as yourself back to this . . . plastic hotel room and . . . rip you off for spare change to run a

They're driving me crazy.
Hey, look what's comin' through the door!
MUHAMMITZ . . .
Ah, it's really great now . . . more paper, more paper . . . page two..
(mumbles . . . ) Ah, another page! Don't leave me, oh, I can't live without your super substances, oh let me write that down, super substances!
Yes! Oh, show me a little ass! Oh, scuze me

Man! This stuff is great! It's just as if Donovan himself had appeared on my very own TV with words of peace, love, and eternal cosmic wisdom . . . ! Leading me. Guiding me. On paths of everlasting pseudo-karmic negligence, in the very midst of my drug-induced nocturnal emission.
For I am your good conscience, Jeff. I know all. I see all. I am a cosmic love pulse matrix, becoming a technicolor interpositive!
Huh? Where'd you buy that incense? It's hip.
It's the same and mysterious exotic oriental fragrance as what the Beatles get off on.
I thought I recognized it . . . Sniff, sniff . . . Mmm, what is that, MUSK? Sniff, sniff, sniff . . . mmmh!
Jeff, I know what's good for you.
Right. You're heavy.
Yes, Jeff, I am your guiding light. Listen to me.
Don't rip off the towels, Jeff!
Piss off, you little nitwit!
Hey man, what's the deal?
Don't listen to him, Jeff, he's no good. He'll make you do BAD THINGS!
You mean, he'll make me sin?
Yes, Jeff. SIN!
Wow!
Jeff, I'd like to have a word with you . . . about your soul.
No, don't listen, Jeff.
Why are you wasting your life, night after night playing this comedy music?
You're right, I'm too heavy to be in this group.
Comedy music . . .
Jeff, YOUR SOUL!
Oh, ah Oh, you're wasting your life
To be . . .
Ah Oh, ah Ah, ah
Too heavy, Jeff
In this group, all I ever get to do is play Zappa's comedy music. HE EATS!
Jeff!
I get so tense!
Of course you do, my boy.
The stuff he makes me do is always off the wall!
That's why it would be best to leave his stern employ.
And quit the group!
You'll make it big!
That's right.
Of course!
And then I won't be SMALL!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ti-diddly-diddly-dee
Ha, ha, ha . . .

Cough, cough. Ahmet Ertegun used this towel as a bathmat six weeks ago at a rancid motel in Orlando, Florida, with the highest MILDEW rating of any commercial lodging facility within the territorial limits of the United States, naturally excluding tropical possessions . . . It's still damp. What an aroma! This is the best I ever got off! What can I say about this elixir?
This is the real you, Jeff. Rip off a few more ashtrays. Get rid of some of that inner tension. Quit the comedy group!
Get your own group together. Heavy! Like GRAND FUNK! Or BLACK SABBATH . . .
No, Jeff . . .
Or COVEN!
Peace . . . Love . . .
Bollocks!
What can I say about this elixir?
What?
WOWWWWWW!
What can I?
WOWWWWWW!
What?
What can I say about this?

Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the French Riviera at the MIDEM convention. A fake tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and customized by Rantoon
Tan, Hantoon Frammin, and DEE . . .
Followed by twelve potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice, with your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner office, and Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets on Air Rangoon.
Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a fake rock and roll guitar player in a comedy group?

I'm going to die. I know I'm going to die, I can tell because my pulse is so weak. The pills . . . I took so many downers that I know this is the end for me.
You poor thing. You want us to fix your hair for you so you look good when they find you?
Oh . . . would you?
Sure, whaddyawant? A ponytail? A flat-top with fenders?
I'm gonna die, Janet, I'm gonna O.D.! So, make me look good.
Listen, the best I can do for you is fix your hair, so why don't you get up and wash that melted eye makeup off your face.
Is it smeared? I've been crying so much . . . it's so damn sad when you know you'll never see all your friends anymore.
Every week it's the same old thing. You're gonna die. You're gonna die. Somebody went out on you. Somebody doesn't love you anymore. How long you been a groupie? You should get used to romances which are so obviously cheap. Listen, just in case you crash out, and the imaginary rock and roll newspaper from San Francisco wants to get any pictures of you, you'll look like you washed your face. Really.
It's better this way with a clean face.
People think groupies are such dirty girls.
Heh . . . I wouldn't mind sort of fucking all three of them!
Look, over there!
What?
He's doing it, he's watching us from the fake bandstand with the binoculars!
Who, the English dude?
Oh, rivet-boy!
The rivet boy? Where?
Over there, wipe that stuff out of your eyes.
It looks like he's beating off.
Beating off? I knew he was a pervert.
Eww, how exciting. Hey, are you still trying to O.D.?
Yes, this definitely is the end for me!
I feel so faint! So weak!
Good evening honey, that was the most imaginary collapse I've seen since last week.
Janet, do you think she's going to die?
Are you kidding? Did you see her hit the floor?
God, well it was so obviously cheap. Lift up your head, honey.
I'm going to die. This time it's real.
Listen, Lucy, we gotta get ready for our big dance number, we're going to the fake nightclub tonight.
Everything's getting dim.
Why don't you tell her a story while you put your makeup on? Good evening.
Oh. Listen, toots. I'm going to make up a nice little fairy tale for you.
The pills, the Mandrax, I took so many of them.
I'll tell you part of the story, and then you make up another part that goes along with it. Once upon a time there was a tall, handsome, muscular . . .
Dwarf.
. . . with a very special . . .
Swedish apparatus!
. . . that him and his friends would use in c onjunction with . . .
Bold new surgical experiments!
. . . involving . . .
A bludgeon, and a bottle of champagne . . .
. . . and a . . .
. . . microwave oven . . .
. . . from a . . .
. . . jumbo jet, one of the big jobs leased from
Air Rangoon!
. . . which, when used correctly . . .
. . . can effectively increase the dimensions . . .
. . . and firepower of your . . .
. . . dick . . .
. . . to the point where . . .
. . . in some instances, it should be classified as a lethal weapon!
Your dick!
Your dick?
Your dork!
Your dork?
Your prick!
Your prick?
Your pork!
Your pork?
Your pork?
Who calls it a pork? These men, and the stuff they call a wee-wee!
A wee-wee?
You mean a penis, don't you?
A penis?
Penis is such an ugly word.
It's not that ugly, really.
Sure, I-I use it all the time.
Sure, sure, we all say it every once in a while. Listen:
PENIS.
Ewww!
Penis! Penis!
Ew, it sounds so revolting the way you guys say it. Ew, ka-ka.
Ka-ka!
The penis can be a very useful organ.
Yeah, and very exciting, too, once you get to know me.
Oh, yeah, right, yeah, etc . . .
Penis!
It sounds so overwhelmingly medicinal.
A penis sounds like something a doctor would have hanging off of him.
None of the men I know and love in the rock and roll business got penises. They all got cocks or dicks at least.
Sure, you want to go strap on a pop star, and he wants to stick a penis up you, where is that at?
Let's ask our studio audience!
Will you trade what he has in his pants for what I have behind this curtain?
What is it?
You mean what's in his pants?
I know what's in his pants, he's a lonely guy.
You have to choose before the big wheel stops whirling. You! Hey, buddy! Sky marshall! Go whirl the big wheel!
Can I just take the money?
There isn't any money, just the curtain and . . .
. . . the lonely guy.
Time is running out, think it over carefully.
The curtain!
I want the money.
Wait! What could it be in there?
In his pants?
In the curtain!
Doesn't anybody care what's in my pants?
Penis dimension
Penis dimension
Penis dimension is worrying me
I can't hardly sleep at night
'Cause of penis dimension
Do you worry?
Do you worry a lot?
No!
Do you worry?
Do you worry and moan . . .
That the size of your cock is not monstrous enough?
It's your penis dimension!
Penis dimension!
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Hiya friends. Now just be honest about it. Did you ever consider the possiblity that your penis, and in the case of many dignified ladies, that the size of the titties themselves might provide elements of sub-conscious tension? Weird, twisted anxieties that could force a human being to have to become a politician!
A policeman!
A Jesuit monk
A rock and roll guitar player! A wino! You name it. Or in the case of the ladies, the ones that can't afford a silicone
BEEF-UP, they become writers of hot books
"Manuel, the gardener, placed his burning phallus in her quivering quim."
Yes, or they become Carmelite nuns!
"Gonzo, the lead guitar player, placed his mutated member in her slithering slit." Ha ha ha! Ooh . . .
Or race horse jockeys. There is no reason why you or your loved ones should suffer. Things are bad enough, without the size of your organ adding even more misery to the TROUBLES OF THE WORLD!
Right on, right on!
Now, if you're a lady and you've got munchkin tits, you can console yourself with this age-old line from primary school:
ANYTHING OVER A MOUTHFUL IS WASTED! YES!
And isn't it the truth? And if you're a guy, and one night you're at a party and you're trying to be cool, I mean, you aren't even wearing any underwear, you're being so cool, and somebody hits on you one night, and he looks you up and down and he says, uh . . .
Eight inches or less?
Well let me tell you, brothers, that's the time when you've got to turn around and look that sonofabitch right between the eyes, and you got to tell him these words:
I stuff three pair of socks and a bar of beauty soap down in front of my pants!
She painted up her face

Half a dozen provocative squats!
Out of the shower, she squeezes her spots;
Brushes her teeth;
Shoots a deodorant spray up her twat . . .
(It's getting her, getting her
Hot--Oh-woh-woh-woh-woh-woh)
She's just twenty-four
And she can't get off,
A sad but typical case, yeah
Last dude to do her
Got in and got soft;
She blew it,
And laughed in his face, yeah!
Face, yeah!
Yeah
She chooses all the clothes
She'll wear tonight to dance in!
The places that she goes
Are filled with guys from groups,
Waiting for a chance to break her pants in
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!

Well, at least there's sort of a choice there;
Twenty or thirty at times there have been--
Somewhat desirable boys there--
Dressed really spiffy, with long hair--
Waiting for girls they can shove it right in

Hello there. All the guys in the band are pretending to get ready so they can go out and find some pussy.
Oh, I wonder where the action is in this town?
Every musician likes to find some pussy.
Boy, I coulda really scored last night. But every night its the same thing; Aynsley gets there first. He's so FAST . . . it must be from playing the drums or something. I mean . . . if those girls over there only knew my secret identity, but
. . . but how COULD they? How- how could they know that I am Bwana Dik?
Where's my hair dryer? Got to look lovely for the girls. After all, I am Bwana Dik.
Each guy has his own speciality for getting the girl of his dreams.
I sprayed my pits . . . I put on a new tie-dye t-shirt . . . I brushed my teeth . . .
I cleaned my glasses . . .
I buffed my nails.
I bought a copy of Down Beat so I could carry it around and look like I knew what was happening.
I left my shirt unbuttoned at the top . . .
I just KNOW I'm gonna get laid tonight. I'm not taking any chances. I got this little jar of tinsel glitter here . . . the same brand Danny Hutton puts on his face that makes him look all . . . glistening and seductive. Just put a little on here . . . the cheeks . . . the chin . . . mmm, the quivering lips . . . I'm so commercial I could die! Somebody . . .
TURN ON A BLUE SPOTLIGHT!!!
What will this morning bring me this evening?
Some local hot action
Before we are leaving (maybe we can get some head)
Go to the club or the bar or wherever the pussy is found
In the town your band is booked to play in
It's always a little bit harder to score
If it's just your first time in a town you never hit before
If you stayed in it once and got laid
You've got it made, ahhh, got it made
If it's just your first time
Then you know it's no fun to go
Back to a plastic hotel all alone
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Or wherever the pussy is found
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
She's such a dignified lady
She's so pretty and soft
You can't call her a groupie
It just pisses her off
She got diamonds and jewelry
She got lotsa new clothes
She ain't hurtin' for money
So that everyone knows
That she knows what she wants
Knows what she likes
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . she's got her eyes on you
She left her place after midnight
And she drove to the club
You know that her and her partner
Came here lookin' for love
They want a guy from a group
Got a thing in a charts
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
They will give him their hearts
'Cause they know what they want
And they know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . they got their eyes on you
FAM-BAM-YAK-A-TA-TAHHH!
They know what they want
Know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Awright, you got 'em screamin' all night
Screamin' all night
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Bentley!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Chevy!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Or a Lincoln!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
['Cause they're dancin'!]
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo . . .
Oh wow, what a night. What's the matter, didn't you get any action tonight?
Didn't you used to be with the Mothers?
Yeah.
Is this what you do now?
I've got my own group, too. I don't mind being in this movie. I get a chance to transform a few times, drink these vile, foamy liquids.
Bleagh.
What kind of a life is that?
It's not that bad! Really! I LIKE to be a monster every once in awhile!
No one will ever take you seriously after this.
Why, because I transform? I LIKE to be a monster!
There's a little monster in every one of us.
You'll probably stay here for the rest of your life with your fake potions and your twisted monster face. You coulda
BEEN something in rock and roll.
I TRIED to get a hit single. It drove me to drink.
Ugh.
Hoo-hoo-ha-ha . . .
Go on, laugh about it. You could have been a star. You could have spread your aura across vast continental areas, your name on millions of small, hot lips, whispering under secure, pink blankets in the lonely midnight dark. But whaddya do? Ya join the Mothers, and ya end up working for Zappa, and he makes you be a creep! You coulda played the blues with John Mayall, or far-out exciting jazz with Blood Sweat and Tears.
You really think so?
Look. No one will ever take you seriously after this. How can they take you seriously? In this business you've either got to play the blues or sing with a high voice.
You're right. I never should have joined the Mothers. Why, I could be a star now! Oh, when I think of all those millions of . . .
Hey.
Hot pink juicy little . . .
Hey. Listen, do you know where I can uh, get any dope in this imaginary town?
Man, there's no dope in this town. Just these vile, foamy liquids.
Well, they're fake aren't they?
No, they're real! I mix them myself at home, and then I bring them in the morning . . . secret spiritual formulas . . .
Ew, what's a secret spiritual formula?
The stuff that goes in the elixir, the potion, whatever
I mix is irrelevant to the result.
You mean they're fake potions, right?
Look, it doesn't matter what's in the mix. It's the liquid! The concept . . . of the liquid . . . is enough to trigger a special cosmic state. Its because I'm so spiritually evolved . . .
Oh, listen, I just wanna get out of it, and go back to me fake motel room and play the blues, you know. Fuck your spiritual evolvement. Anyway, what happens if a new and exciting blues talent such as meself drinks your stuff?
Here. Take this back to your fake room.
Drink it.
I'd feel a lot happier if there was something I could smoke.
Well, here. Dip this in it. Now, let it dry out. That ought to get you a little HIGH. Or something.
Ew, I can't take you seriously.
Look, you might as well take this too.
I know its only fake potion. Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues.
Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks?
White people can play the blues, you know.
Hello. Frank. Yeah, I gave it to him.
Yeah, he went back to the special room.
No, no. He's gonna smoke it. Yeah, right.
Hey, listen. You got any idea when we're gonna get paid for this?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
A succulent fat one
A mod little flat one
Maybe a hot one (to give me the clap!)
Maybe a freak who gets off with a strap
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues. Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? White people can play the blues, you know. Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? Why not some extended blues licks?
Yeah, I gave it to him. Yeah, he went back to the special room. No, no. He's gonna smoke it.
Jeff has gone out there on that stuff!
He should have never have used the elixir and only stuck to the incense. Oh, Atlantis . . .
That was BILLY THE MOUNTAIN, dressed up like Donovan, fading out on the wall-mounted TV screen. Jeff IS flipping out. Road fatigue! We've got to get him back to normal before Zappa finds out, and steals it, and makes him do it in the movie!
You have a brilliant career ahead of you, my boy,
Just GET OUT OF THIS GROUP!
Howard, that was Studebacher Hoch, dressed up like Jim Pons, giving career guidance to the bass player of a rock-oriented comedy group. Jeff's imagination has gone beyond the fringe of audience comprehension.
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, the Phlorescent Leech!
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, Eddie!
I'm stealing the towels! Ha ha . . . ha ha . . .
Stealing the room
Stealing the . . . Stealing the room
I'm  I'm
Stealing  Stealing
I'm  I'm  Stealing
This, as you might have gathered, is the end of the movie. The entire cast is assembled here at the Centerville
Recreational Facility to bid farewell to you, and to express thanks for your attendance at this theater.
This might seem old fashioned to some of you, but I'd like to join in on this song.
It's the kind of a sentimental song that you get at the end of a movie, , it's the kind of a song that people might sing to let you in the audience know that we really like you and care about you, yeah . . .
Understand how hard it is to laugh these days, with all the terrible problems in the world!
Lord, have mercy on the people in England
For the terrible food these people must eat
And may the Lord have mercy on the fate of this movie
And God bless the mind of the man in the street
Help all the rednecks and the flatfoot policemen
On the terrible functions they all must perform
God help the winos, the junkies, and the weirdos
And every poor soul who's adrift in the storm.
Help everybody, so they all get some action
Some love on the weekend, some real satisfaction
A room and a meal
And a garbage disposal
A lawn and a hose'll
Be strictly genteel
Lord, have mercy on the hippies and faggots
And the dykes and the weird little children they grow
Help the black man
Help the poor man
Help the milk man
Help the door man
Help the lonely, neglected old farts that I know
Well, it certainly has been swell . . .
If your name wasn't on the list of blessings we've been passing out tonight, we don't want you to be pissed off.
No . . .
We don't want you to leave that theater.
Forgive him, for he knows not what he does.
But before we go on, I'd like to introduce to you . . .
On the other hand, maybe he does know . . .
. . . my good friend and musical associate, Mr. Howard Kaylan who's about to give us a closing final benediction.
They're gonna clear out the studio
They're gonna tear down all the . . .
They're gonna whip down all the . . .
They're gonna sweep out all the . . .
They're gonna pay off all the . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
Hey hey hey, everybody in the orchestra and the chorus
Talkin' 'bout every one of our lovely and talented dancers
Talkin' 'bout the light bulb men
Camera men
The make-up men
Yeah, the rake-up men
They're all gonna rise up
They're gonna jump up
I said jump up
Talkin' 'bout jump right up and off the floor
Jump right up and hit the door
They're all gonna rise up and jump off!
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
And once again
Take themselves
Seriously, yeeeah!
Two, three, four, seriously
They're all gonna go home (ye-hey!)
Through the driving sleet and rain
They're all gonna go home
Through the fog, through the dust
Through the tropical fever and the blistering frost
They're all gonna go home
And get out of it as they can be, baby
And the same goes for me
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
And each and every member of this rock oriented comedy group in his own special way
Is gonna get out of it as he can be
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
And I am definitely gonna get . . .
REAMED
'Cause I'm such a lonely
I'm such a lonely
A lonely, lonely, talkin' 'bout a lonely guy!
Oh, and I know tonight, I am definitely . . .
I am positively . . .
I just have to get . . .
BENT, REAMED AND WASTED
A disaster area the size of Atlantic City, New Jersey!
He's making me do this, ladies and gentlemen. I wouldn't do it if it weren't for him. You noticed, all through this material, I've been glancing over toward my left? Well, I'll tell you the reason for that, ladies and gentlemen. HE is over there. HE is over on the left. HE is the guy that is making me do all this shit. Right over there.
Now all through this movie, every time we've been on stage, I've had to look over in that direction, right?
You saw it . . . you know. Well that's 'cause HE's over there. I've got to watch him for signs.
He jumps up and down like a jackass. I can't even believe the guy sometimes.
But we gotta watch him. "After all," we said,
"it's Frank's movie."
Now, we're THE MOTHERS, but it's still Frank's movie.
Let's say it, he got to paid for it, he rented the studio, had all these cheesy sets built . . .
It's so moche! I can't even stand it . . .
He's telling everybody, right now, right over there, to . . .

The only exceptions to this rule are the personnel listed on the other memo I have sent you.

A fine clear morning and all is well.
Ahoy, there! Look up!
Fetch me a bow.
Look.
Captain! Captain Sinbad!
Up there in the sky.
It's holding something.
Abdullah.
It shines like gold.
Too strange to be an albatross.
A jackdaw?
They steal bright things.
No, too big for a jackdaw.
Omar!
You fool!
You have brought bad luck on us all!
Captain...
Cast it over the side. It is evil.
I feel it.
Captain!
For the love of Allah, cast it overboard.
I think I'll keep it.
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
- Captain!
- It's smashing us to pieces!
Can't hold her, Captain.
She's running before the wind. Look!
We're being driven on to the rocks.
Lash that sail!
Cut it adrift if you have to.
Abdullah!
Allah give me strength!
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Marabia.
It must be Marabia.
We are way off course.
No. The dream I had, Rachid.
This it all part of it somehow.
We have been brought here by some mysterious force.
Is it not written -
- that a wise man will try to realize his dream, to follow it?
Some say that it is through dreams that Allah speaks to mortal man.
- To forsake the dream...
- Is to forsake Him.
Captain, he who walks on fire will burn his feet.
Captain?
I'm going ashore.
- Aye. There's a good anchorage beyond.
- And that's where we'll meet.
Do as he says!
We make for the anchorage!
You are Captain Sinbad?
I am.
You are also a thief.
And a thief is a king until he's caught.
The bauble that hangs at your throat is mine. Hand it to me.
Or you will have no throat.
You'll be dead if you don't.
You stole it from my courier.
Very well.
It's Koura! The black prince!
We have waited for you a long time.
He escaped, Achmed.
He rode into the city and escaped.
The Sultan's guards helped him.
But you are all right?
I brought the city gates down upon their foolish faces.
Master, your hand.
We must hurry, Achmed. He who searches for pearls should not sleep.
Sinbad is even now with the vizier.
I must hear what passes between them.
Walls have mice and mice have ears.
And I have my spy.
He has failed me once but never twice.
You tell a strange tale, Captain.
Nevertheless, one fact makes me believe your story.
The amulet around your neck.
It makes us allies against the same enemy -
- who covets it as much as I.
Fate, destiny have brought us together.
I would like to think so.
Why?
Our country is being choked by a great evil visited upon us by Prince Koura.
Koura?
The one who attacked me?
A man versed in every black art -
- and dedicated to bringing this domain under his power.
Please. I have an equally strange tale to tell.
When our Sultan died without a son, -
- he made me, his grand vizier, heir to two things.
The two being part of one great, mighty secret.
What are these two things you speak of?
You shall see.
Here is the first.
These pictures tell the story of a legend as yet unrealised.
Little remains, for even as our Sultan breathed his last breath, -
- and I hastened here to read the secrets, -
- a great ball of fire engulfed this room.
A fire which took my face -
- and left these few scorched patches that now you see.
- A ball of fire?
- It was Koura's work.
You spoke of two things bequeathed to you.
Here is the second.
Something the fire could not destroy.
A token. A sign. A riddle.
And it is said that the riddle will be unraveled -
- when this and the one about your neck -
- are placed before a great eminence who dwells in a temple of many faces.
And yet still incomplete.
A perfect match.
You see, I was right, Captain.
Destiny has brought you here.
But it is still a riddle.
These? This?
The key to a great and mighty secret?
What secret?
What is to be revealed?
Power. Absolute power.
Power to rid this land forever of
Koura's black and ugly ambitions.
- If this fell into Koura's hands...
- That thought constantly torments me.
If Koura were to obtain absolute power in this land, -
- freedom and happiness would be lost.
- Forever.
- Absolute power?
I pray to Allah, but he does not hear me.
Then you and I must see to it that we solve this mystery before Koura.
If Allah be willing.
Part of it must be here.
I see a ship. A long voyage.
- An island.
- And these foreboding symbols.
It can only mean danger of death.
Or great riches perhaps.
A lost treasure.
Or it could mean nothing at all.
The more I study it, the greater the puzzle becomes.
The golden tablets then.
What of these?
There is a third part still to be found.
It must be found, or our land will be plagued forever.
But how to get the third?
Vizier...
Don't you see it?
The meridian.
And there are shoals, an island.
It's a chart, Grand Vizier.
A nautical chart.
And you are a sea Captain.
Allah be praised!
You can go home.
- Is this a ship or a monastery?
- We sail with the tide.
She only removed two veils!
If the winds are with us, we'll reach this area before the rise of Venus.
And then we follow Orion into unknown waters.
- Why do you stare at me?
- Do you believe in destiny?
- That is what has brought us together.
- Possibly.
And with the help of Allah we will surely triumph.
There is an old proverb
I choose to believe.
"Trust in Allah, but tie up your camel."
It is Koura's spy. His watchdog.
Quick, quick!
There!
Already it may have betrayed us.
In the name of the Almighty, what was it?
Koura's creation.
A living homunculus.
An extension of his eyes and ears.
And with it -
- he now knows as much as we.
It's a race then. A duel.
We seek an island.
An ultimate destination.
He will also seek it.
Find me a ship and a Captain who can be trusted.
He must make ready to sail with the next tide.
All right, all right!
Excellent. You are even better than they say you are.
It is Sinbad, isn't it?
Captain of the ship that lies offshore?
I'm Hakim, owner of this aureate establishment.
I wish to employ you.
- Sorry, I sail with the tide.
- It is only a small service.
No longer than it takes to drink a coffee.
Please, just hear me.
It will only take a moment.
It's only a small service.
This is my son Haroun. A waster, a fool.
200 gold coins if you take him with you.
Take him with me?
- I couldn't even use him for ballast.
- 300 gold coins.
You cannot pick up two melons with one hand, and I cannot work miracles.
Hurry, hurry.
Come sit down.
- The girl...
- That girl? A worthless slave.
But you like her?
You view her with favour?
She's yours.
I give her freely. A gift.
Along with my son and 400 gold coins.
- What is your name?
- Margiana.
That mark.
- How did you get it?
- I've had it since I was a child.
- An evil eye.
- No, no.
It was tattooed on.
- Perhaps it is a good omen.
- It's to ward off evil spirits.
You have nothing else to tell me?
She is curvaceous.
Not deliciously fat as I prefer.
But at night a cotton seed is the same as a pearl.
- She finds favour in my eyes.
- Yes? It's a bargain.
The girl, my son and 400 gold coins.
- Allah will smile on you.
- More likely he will laugh at me.
Bring them to my ship.
It shall be done.
Very strange trip.
- Grand Vizier!
- Look what's coming aboard.
Salaam alaykum.
I've heard of gold going to a man's head, but this...
- Cast off.
- Cast off!
Cast off!
- Raise the sail up.
- Sail up!
Fair wind, Captain.
Aye. Fair wind and a fine one.
Every voyage has its own flavour.
- You know what is expected of you?
- Aye, my Lord.
In a few moments Sinbad's ship will come around that headland.
Follow him, Captain.
Gently, cunningly.
Keeping him always just within sight.
He who is patient obtains.
You're thinking the same as I, Rachid?
Captain, an island. If it is here, then it can only be one place.
- Lemuria.
- Lemuria?
The mythical island. Mariners have searched for it for centuries.
It is all that is left of a mighty continent now sunk beneath the waves.
It is a place of untold dangers, of death. They say...
That the man who fears the unknown will take fright of his own backside.
There you have it. We seek Lemuria.
We wager our skill against death.
And for rich reward. Find this island and a handsome prize awaits every man.
Are you with me?
To Lemuria!
And a bounty to boot!
- Even if it be into the jaws of hell?
- We cannot be bought, Captain.
Only with money.
Then be warned.
We can afford no laggards.
Every man must carry his own weight and more.
There's water everywhere!
- We're at sea!
- This boy is a genius.
I remember my father's shop and my father coming up...
Father! This was his idea, wasn't it?
A quick run around the harbour to clear the cobwebs away?
All right. The sea breeze is beautiful, cobwebs are all gone.
Now we can go home.
Sorry.
We are on course now.
- You are with us all the way.
- All the way?
Well, things could be worse. A couple of days away from home isn't too bad.
A couple of weeks?
A month?
- More than a month?
- Two, three years perhaps.
Two or three years?!
But I'll be an old man by then.
- Show me to my cabin so I can lie down.
- No cabin. You bunk with the men.
You want to eat, you work.
Work? Work?!
This is terrible!
Haroun.
You pace the deck like a caged beast.
For one who enjoys hashish you should be more at peace.
- I'll put you on watch.
- On watch?
All you have to do is sit down and keep a sharp lookout.
Sit down and look? Fine.
Haroun...
Up there.
That's where you sit.
I forget I have company.
Your pardon.
No, no. I am the one who bows.
You are my guest.
- But I am your slave.
- Slave? Up, up.
- You own me now.
- Own you?
No human being has the right to own another.
You are free now.
You belong to no one but yourself.
On this ship you are at no one's beck and call. You understand that?
Right. I go to change.
Fetch me a drink.
Please.
- You will be sleeping in here?
- Of course.
Captain Sinbad! Sinbad!
Aye?
Haroun saw a light on the horizon.
Over there.
- A ship.
- Following us?
- Stay on this course.
- Aye.
If she's still with us at daybreak, we know.
It is Koura.
Aye.
- I should come about and sink him.
- If he does not sink us first.
Sinbad has sent more pirates to the bottom of the sea than I can count.
There is much at stake, my friend.
We must maintain our lead.
With a ship like that?
We can't outrun him forever.
But if you can outwit him...
The cabin looks very neat.
You have all a woman's gifts.
- Yes, all of them. Save one.
- What is that? curiosity. You never ask why
I brought you along on this voyage.
I've only just become a free woman.
Slaves do not ask questions.
I'm happy you brought me along.
We're being hunted, pursued like prey.
And I must lose the hunter.
- Who pursues us?
- A man.
A great, black bat of a man.
He is one of the reasons you are here.
He, and that mark on your hand.
But why? Why?
I wish I knew myself.
Hold steady.
We lead him into this area of dense mist here.
There's enough rocks to snare a prow or rip open a keel.
But if you lead him there, you run the same risk yourself.
Not quite the same. I've navigated these waters before. Eh, Rachid?
Once before.
We'll abandon the chains!
How can he see to steer the ship?
It's terrible.
- How can he see anything?
- The Captain won't need to see.
He'll feel his way through.
Drop anchor!
Not yet. Pursue that ship!
Continue into this?
We will be wrecked.
- Well, Sinbad navigates these waters.
- Then he must have a chart to follow.
- Three points east.
- Aye, Captain.
As Allah wills.
It's alive! It's moving!
It's alive! It's alive!
For the love of Allah! The chart!
- It's taken the chart!
- Never mind. Fight it with fire.
Return. Return.
Return.
She's sunk.
Straight to the bottom.
- Impossible. Wood floats.
- The harpoon was made of iron.
- It took the chart.
- But I still carry the course.
Here.
Return...
Return.
Return... Return now.
Return!
To him who breathed life into you.
Return!
Return...
Master?
Master.
Your face... It's aged.
Master, you are ill.
You saw everything.
- I came when I heard your cry.
- Then you know.
- Enough, Master.
- Yes, yes...
You will die if you go on.
To summon the demons of darkness has a price.
And each time I call upon them, it consumes part of me.
Come, Achmed.
We have no time to lose.
Haul it aboard! Easy, easy.
Your sword.
Bring us back on course, Captain.
- You like the lute, Captain?
- Very much. Play me a tune sometime.
But I was playing a tune.
Land ho!
Lemuria.
Where we are destined to find our answer.
- We go ashore at daybreak!
- May good fortune accompany us.
The Captain reports we are well on course.
But there is no hope of overtaking Sinbad?
No matter, Achmed. I expected such a possibility. I am prepared for it.
Mandrake root and a few chemicals is all that is needed.
No! Don't throw stones in the well that you drink from.
Do you dare defy the demons of darkness?
I've watched them drain your strength.
Look! See what they have done to you already.
If you continue, you will perish before this journey is over.
Have you no faith in my powers?
We are soon to triumph, Achmed.
My life, my blood shall bring life.
Don't fear it, Achmed.
It is our friend.
Come on.
You will find Sinbad, my little friend. Seek him out.
Magic purges the soul, Achmed.
The night with its ears and the day with its eyes.
Come ashore.
There's someone moving.
Beckoning.
I didn't expect you to volunteer.
Any land is good for these legs.
Even dangerous land?
Dangerous? You never told me it would be dangerous.
You didn't ask.
To land on these shores is cause for celebration.
Have them return to the ship and see that every man gets wine.
I know you propose we go alone into this place. But just the two of us?
We shall not lack for protection,
Achmed. We shall not lack for that.
Stop!
Sinbad, look!
Your courage has deserted you?
Me? No.
My heart is full of bravery.
But I have cowardly legs.
As it was written:
A temple with many faces.
The temple of the Oracle of All Knowledge.
But I never thought to stand here.
We must seek out the great eminence.
- Is it the oracle?
- No, a guardian.
The keeper to whom we should present ourselves.
I bring you a token.
A sign from the sultans of Marabia.
We come humbly seeking the Oracle of All Knowledge.
Two golden tablets that fit as one.
Two tablets brought forth to the light, yet a third remains from sight.
A third?
A final place must still be found, a place that lies deep below the ground.
- He talks in riddles.
- No race is lost until it's won.
And close behind you comes the black and evil son.
Spawned by the Devil, suckled upon black milk, in human form. clad in robes of silk.
Destiny, destiny.
Destiny is invisible yet visible, and men may try to hide.
Yet its waters mark you clearly like a rainbow in the sky.
Destiny is a place where both good and evil wait.
And yet their very equality negates their power.
For it is the very deeds of weak and mortal men -
- that may tip the scales one way or the other.
And then the world shall know, and you shall know -
- which way the Fates have chosen you shall go.
Go!
Go now!
- Go?
- Go north.
North to barren lands of pagan places and pagan bands.
Before a goddess cast with many limbs.
And death to all intruders is their whim.
In that sacred place -
- hid from the eyes of man is the third gold tablet -
- that completes the plan.
Go now.
Go now.
Go north... Go north...
Back! Go back!
Go! Down here! Inside!
Captain!
The entrance is blocked!
Farewell, Sinbad.
Perhaps it is our destiny to be buried alive.
A man's destiny lies in his own hands.
A live dog is better than a dead lion.
Rachid, your bow.
All of you, your turbans and sashes.
Make a strong rope.
I knew we'd go mad down here eventually.
An arrow.
A straight, sure arrow.
A strong rope.
Come on, men. Trust in Allah.
But tie up your camel.
Do as he says.
Your turbans and sashes.
Hurry, hurry!
Tie strong.
Strong.
Good, good.
Rachid.
Sinbad, you've done it!
- I'm the lightest.
- But I'm the most foolhardy.
- Easy, Captain.
- He's going too fast.
Up you go.
Go on, Captain.
Sinbad, look out!
What is it, Master?
All of you, up you come.
Margiana first.
Moving north.
- It is as the oracle said.
- There's a steep climb ahead.
What is it, Master?
They mean to sacrifice us to their living god. Don't!
O mighty Kali.
Mightier than thou am I.
Make obeisance to me!
Dance! Dance for me!
Stop!
- Achmed...
- Master?
I shall remain and commune with their deity. Go!
Go now.
In that sacred place hid from the eyes of man is the third gold tablet.
The third tablet is here somewhere.
And I shall find it.
I shall find it!
I won't be denied! I won't!
Koura!
We meet again.
- To the death.
- To the death.
To the death, Kali.
Death to our enemy.
No, wait! Don't!
Stay back!
Stand clear!
The third golden tablet.
Here it is written -
- that the Fountain of Destiny lies within easy march.
Yes. Where the gods smile upon mortal men.
But I shall not enter that hallowed place empty-handed.
For it is also written -
- that he who places these tablets into the waters of the fountain -
- shall receive in turn:
Youth.
A shield of darkness.
And best of all:
A crown of untold riches.
All this is my destiny.
But I fear your destiny lies before you.
Have you not destroyed their shrine?
May Allah receive you.
I bid you farewell.
Their journey is over and mine almost.
Return to the ship, Achmed.
- To hear is to obey, Master.
- Have the crew make ready to leave.
Sire.
They think she is one of their own.
A goddess. We are saved.
No, she is the chosen one of their God of the Single Eye.
- Sinbad!
- Margiana!
Vizier, take off your mask.
Uncover your face!
Sinbad!
Into the tunnel! This way!
Rachid, over there.
Vizier, in there.
We must find Margiana.
Let them sustain me!
Margiana? Margiana?
The Fountain of Destiny.
The final place.
Margiana... come.
You followed me instead of Koura?
- Then he has won this race.
- The race perhaps.
- And the prize?
- Not the prize.
- A crown of untold riches...
- I regret nothing.
Frightened you, huh?
Margiana?
The final place.
The energy of youth is mine again.
You are too late, Sinbad.
The shield of darkness, a crown of many riches. I'll deny you these.
O gods and demons of darkness!
Rid me forever of this enemy -
- who stands between me and my destiny! I'll plead!
- They don't hear you, Koura.
- I implore!
Kill him!
Destroy Sinbad!
It is as the oracle foretold.
The forces of good and evil battling eternally.
It also foretold that it is the deeds of weak and mortal men.
That may tip the scales one way or the other.
Rachid!
Sinbad!
No!
Oh no!
And now, Sinbad...
- A shield of darkness shall be mine.
- I see no shield.
You will.
Look carefully, Sinbad.
What you cannot see, you cannot kill.
I congratulate you, Captain.
Your sword arm is excellent, but your eyes betray you.
For now you cannot see me at all.
For all your strength you are helpless.
As helpless as a child.
I can kill you any time, Captain.
Any time.
Am I here?
Or right beside you?
No...
You cannot kill me.
But I can destroy you. All of you.
Sinbad!
A crown of untold riches.
Your Majesty.
Are you not the true and worthy successor to the throne of Marabia?
And has not Allah delivered this -
- into my hands from the wondrous waters of the Fountain of Destiny -
- to rest upon your head?
Praise be to Allah the All-merciful.
I can't understand.
Sinbad, why did you do it?
Give away a whole kingdom, priceless treasure. Why?
I value freedom.
A king is never truly free.
Why, he is even told who he must marry.
Captain! Captain!
Will you take me on as a fully-fledged seaman now?
Aye. And make yourself fast with that rope.
Don't worry.
I always trust in Allah.
But tie up your camel.

- Yeah, I will Mom.
I'll turn it off right after the program's over.
- Program?
You know, I can remember when kids liked to have stories read to them.
They'd actually beg their parents, like their fathers, to read to these stories.
- Dad, you always start talking about that when I want to watch my program.
- It was a very big deal.
The fathers would read these exciting stories, and sometimes, adventure stories to them.
- This is my favorite program, Dad.
- And the kids, would brag to their friends about how their fathers would read these great...
- Dad, the other guys get to watch their programs.
- Kids used to like their parents, used to like them to read these marvelous...
- Dad.
Now let's see, now here's a story.
This is a story...
- There'll be monsters?
- This is a story a man could actually read to his...
- Yeah, okay Dad.
- Monsters?
Yeah, sure, monsters, listen.
Once upon a time, a long way from here, and a long way from now, there was a tiny village where everything, the houses and the carts, the bridges, and the barns, everything, all had points on them.
In fact, it was so full of points, that even the people had points.
The people, right there on top of their heads.
And it didn't seem strange at all because that's the way life was in the village.
That's the way it always had been.
And for all anybody knew, that's the way it always would be.
As you might have already guessed, the main activity of the village was making points.
And needless to say, business was brisk and the competition was competitive.

You could look high, and you could look low, but you'd never hear any complaints on that Count.
Well, almost never.
♪ That's the way it's going to stay ♪
And then, one day, a very unusual thing happened in the village.
A little baby boy was born, a boy named Oblio.
Now, don't get the wrong idea.
The being born part wasn't usual.
Little kids were being born all the time in that village.
What was unusual was that Oblio, unlike any of the other babies born that day, or any other day, had no point.
He had no point at all.
- Hi, son.
Hi, Oblio.
- Well, hello there.
- Hi, how ya doin'?
- Fine, nice to see.
- Good, what's new?
- Same ol' sixes and sevens.
- Really?
Well, I have to...
- I guess you heard about them?
- Them?
- Them, yeah, they had a kid.
- That's nice.
- Kid's got no point.
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious.
Their kid's a kid who's got no point.
- You're putting me on.
- Would I lie to you?
- Well, I think that is wild.
- So, you see, Oblio was a kind of, involuntary, instant celebrity.
His uniqueness was, well, something that was noticed around the village.
Naturally, his parents couldn't help noticing, either.
- We have a lot to be thankful for, you know.
- He's a healthy little nipper, I'll say that.
- And he's happy.
- I'll be he'll be great...
- He has a wonderful disposition.
- Yeah, but he doesn't have a point.
- Maybe, maybe he'll grow one.
- But, he didn't.
No, as things turned out,
Oblio didn't grow any point at all, but it really wasn't so very noticeable.
As a matter of fact, in time, he took to wearing a cap, a pointed cap his mother made.
It kept his head warm, and it did make him look a lot more like the other ordinary kids in the village.
Just about the same time
Oblio got his new cap, he also got
- Arrow, Arrow.
You guessed it, the greatest dog in the world.

And then, one day after school, a very serious thing happened.
- Hey, let's choose up sides for triangle toss.
- I got Harry.
- Okay, then I want Fred.
- Okay, Richard.
- All right, then,
I'll take Oblio.
- Not him, he can't play, out.
- It was the Count's son, and that was the serious thing.
You see, the village Count was a very powerful man, and, frankly, not all that nice a guy, and the way things sometimes work out, a certain amount of that not niceness has rubbed off on his son.
He was liked, but he was not well liked.
- How come you said
I couldn't play?
- 'Cause you can't, so beat it.
- Always have before, me and Arrow.
- Hey, look, you're not playing, so just push on.
- That's not fair.
- Tough, triangle toss is for people with pointed heads.
Toss the triangle...
- We know how to play the game.
- Then run and catch it on your point.
- Everybody knows that.
- Yeah, but you got no point.
So, you can't play.
- We can play better than you can.
- You what?
- I said, we can play better than you can.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You're looking for some real trouble here.
- And I'll bet you we can beat you at triangle toss, too.
- Say that again.
- I said, "I bet we can beat you at"...
- Yeah?
Well, what do you wanna bet?
- Come on no point, what do you wanna bet?
- Bet ya anything.
- Oblio and the Count's kid are gonna duel.

Best two out of three catches, anything's fair.
- Holy cow, wow.
- Only rule is you gotta catch a triangle with your head, or your mutt's, in your case, Oblio.
The first man to catch two triangles wins.
Get the idea, Oblio?
So, long sucker.

- Yay, hooray for Oblio, yay.
- Thanks, but don't forget about Arrow.
Arrow was the...
- I won't forget Arrow, and I won't forget you either, round head.
- Now, why would you want to go say something like that for?
Remember, you were the guy who...
- I'll remember,
Oblio, and so will you.
My father will see to that.
- Hey, come on, it's just a dumb ol' game.
- A game, Oblio?
When my dad gets done with you, you'll wish this dumb ol' game had never been invented.
- If it's that important to you, then...
- Do you gather my meaning, Oblio?
- Predictably enough, when the Count learned of his son's defeat, he was furious.
As for the boy himself, as soon as he saw which way the wind was blowing, he just laid low and let his father's evil disposition lead the way.
- Would that it were not true.
You idiot, you pathetic fool.
I groomed you, how I groomed you.
I cultivated you like a rare flower, and for this?
No, by guile and foul deed
I laid the ground work for you to rule this miserable village one day, and rule you will.
I shall not be denied, but as long as that vile, little round person, that
Oblio languishes among us, your leadership credibility is shot.
We must rid ourselves of that contemptible little twerp, once and for all, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
Yes, you'll still rule one day, you useless nit because Oblio is finished.
You can bank on that.
- Now, the King, was a good-natured, harmless, old fellow, the kind who had weathered life in a rather middle groove, no great highs, no deep lows.
He was a decent, but very ordinary, man.
He was also a very ordinary ruler of other men.
- If it isn't the illustrious...
- My King, a word in your ear.
- Anything you say, my dear Count.
I was just relaxing with a couple of...
- Yes, I saw, King we have a problem.
- Well, that's hard to believe.
I thought all systems were go.
I mean, I always like to think that...
- King, the law of the land has been violated.
- Violated, the law of the land?
Why, why that's impossible...
- It is done.
- But there must be some mistake,
Why, the law of the land clearly states that everything and everyone must have a point.
That purely and simply is the law of the land.
Why, you can't violate a law like that in a place like this, just look around.
- You look around, my dear King.
The law is being violated, at this very moment.
For the sake of all the decent people, appropriate measures must be taken.
- Measures, measures?
My, my, measures on a grave charge like this would require my convening, my convening the tribunal.
- Exactly.
- My.
Now, now why do you want to go and create a problem like that?
- That's no problem, King.
That's a solution.
The problem was created when the law was violated.
In point of fact, by that little round-headed twit, Oblio.
- Oblio? Oblio?
But, I know him, why, he's a nice little boy.
I know his parents.
Why, it was my understanding that this Oblio was developing into a pretty decent little triangle toss player.
- So I gather.
He's also round, which, as you yourself know, is in direct violation of the law.
You may as well face it, my dear King, this Oblio is, literally, an outlaw.
- But that's incredible.
Wait a minute, he wears a nicely pointed hat.
That should Count for something, shouldn't it?
- No way, my King, we must convene a tribunal, a public tribunal, and so we shall, and then, after all the niceties are looked after, this Oblio will be neatly banished, forever.
- A tribunal? No, and for Oblio?
Why, isn't there any other way?
- The law is the law, King.
You cannot fight that.
- The law is the law, well, I never looked at it quite like that.
Very well, a tribunal it is, but I warn you Count, I won't have the boy railroaded.
- Railroaded?
- A turn of phrase, Count.
- While the Count was having a marvelous time, no matter how rotten he may have been ethically and spiritually and every other way, as a prosecutor, he was good, and as a stand-up performer, he was even better.
The way it all worked out, poor little Oblio never had a chance.
- And so, noble King, and good gentlemen of the tribunal,
I would only remind you that this law, so cherished a part of our tradition, was not enacted, nor is it being applied, for purposes of base persecution, or cruel harassment, good gracious no, the law was created to preserve and protect the sanctity, the integrity, the purity of our here, to for, unsullied life mode, and so it is, that this, this freak, this viper, Oblio, by his very existence here in our realm, only serves to...
- My dear, isn't the
Count absolutely too much?
- Well, I'm sure he's very good, but all the same, I can't help feelings sorry for little Oblio.
After all, he is...
- I just don't see how you could say that.
That's so, so sentimental.
Well, sure, he's little, but the law is still the law, and where would we be, my dear, if...
- But, to just sit here while those old men complacently let the little...
- Listen, neither one of us was born yesterday, and we both know if we let one of Oblio's kind stay, before long, the whole village will be crawling with...
- Psst, psst, my dear Count, isn't there some way or other little Oblio could just, sort of, stick around?
I mean, if he promised to keep his hat on all the time and didn't ever...
- In this stead my King, the law is most explicit.
We all agree that there has been a violation of law.
The violator is right here in our midst.
We can see that.
That is, as the fellow says, beyond question.
- Would it help if I promised to never ever play triangle toss again?
I mean, if that's what you're mad about Count, I could...
- No, gentlemen, the only question remaining is one of penalty.
Here, again, the law is crystal clear.
For such a grave breach, banishment, that is the order of the day.
- Yeah the Count's really pulling the chain on that weird little Oblio.
- How can you joke about such a thing?
I think a terrible thing's happening, and Oblio's such a lovely little boy.
- Yeah.
- You know, he's polite, and he's well mannered... - Well, he may be,
- but would you want your daughter to marry... - You're baiting me.
You're deliberately baiting me.
I will not be subject...
- Gentlemen, it remains beyond question that Oblio, by his mere rounded existence, stands in violation of the law.
Here, our duty is clear, but we would ill be serving the law to overlook an entirely new facet of the case.
In point of fact, Oblio was both aided and abetted by his flea-bitten canine.
- Hey, please, don't do anything to Arrow.
- Gentlemen, I charge this dog, Arrow, with criminal conspiracy.
- Honest, Arrow's innocent.
I did it by myself.
I did it, Arrow wasn't even...
- He is as guilty as Oblio himself, but what's more repellent about him, he's a disgrace to everything pointed.
No, gentlemen, this Arrow is not only a conspirator, he is also a traitor, and he, too, must be banished.
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Not bad.
- So, what's the latest?
- Well, you know.
- Wild trial?
- Well, if you've seen one...
- What about this conspiracy business with Sparrow?
- Arrow.
- Right.
- It could be a toughy.
- No, you really think so?
- Conspiracy's no laughing matter.
- Hard way to go, is it?
- Could be for someone like Arrow.
- You know, he doesn't look like the conspiratorial type, though.
- He's got a record long as his tail.
- That long?
- Yeah,
Chasing, night barking, they'll throw the book at 'em.
- Adios, Arrow.
- That's it.
- And so, it is my deeply unpleasant task to declare that this tribunal finds the boy, Oblio, guilty of living within our midst without a point.
For this grave violation of law, he is, from this day forward, banished to the Pointless Forest.
I might just parenthetically add, as our good Count so aptly put it, the law is the law, and as all of you know, without the law, why, why there would be no lawyers and without lawyers there...
Well, it just goes on and on.
- Deal with the dog, my lord.
- Yes, the dog.
Well, Arrow,
I must send you over, too, boy, involuntary conspiracy.
- Take them away.
- Now dear, I know how you hate to wear undershirts, but we don't know what the weather will be like, and this is a dangerous time of year for colds, so...
- Sure, Mom, great,
I'll wear 'em.
So will Arrow.
Don't cry, Mom.
- Well, I just don't want you to take a chill, little Oblio.
- It's just about time, dear.
You all set Ob?
Well, son, I hope you realize,
I mean, I hope you understand how distressing this is for your mother and me.
I just wish there was some way, don't get me wrong,
I believe in obeying the law and everything.
Anything else would be anarchy but, still, I wish there was some way this particular law could be...
- Sure,
Dad, I understand.
- Well, I just wanted you to know this, Oblio.
- Good luck, Oblio.
Good luck, Arrow.
- And, don't blame the
King too much, son.
He just did what he had to do.
Well, after all, it's his job.
Frankly, I wish there never was such a law in the first place.
Now that it's been used, it seems, well, it really seems unfair.
- How come nobody did anything about it before, Dad?
- It just never came up before, son.
- Oblio, here Oblio.
Here's a candy bar for you, for the road.
- Gee, thanks Mr. Candy Man.
- And, this, this is for Arrow.
- Hang in there, Oblio.
- Stay lose, Ob.
- Be seeing you, Oblio.
- Oblio, ol' man, here's a little something for you, just in case you need some change.
You know, you can never tell when you might need a couple of bucks to...
Well, anyway, you know.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Take good care of yourself, dear little Oblio, and eat well, and write to us when you can.
I mean, it doesn't have to be anything long, just a card to say you're fine.
Would you do that, for your poor mommy,
Oblio?
- Sure, Mom, don't worry.
We'll be okay, right Arrow?
Come on, boy, let's go.
- Go get 'em, Oblio.
- Stay in there, pile driver.
- Go straight Ob, you've got it wired!
- Good luck, kid.
- Goodbye, Oblio.
Goodbye, son.
- Goodbye, my little baby.
- Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Come on, Arrow, let's go.

Use the imagination, the view from the mind's eye.
You've got a creative little head on your shoulders there, son.
- I bet you can just picture this little Oblio and his dog right now.
♪ Me and my Arrow
On and on they went.
After a while, they even stopped looking back.
The village having long since faded in the distance, and the truth of the matter is they were really a lot more excited about what lay ahead of them than what they had left behind, and who wouldn't be?
No one had ever been to the Pointless Forest.
Yet, now, Oblio and
Arrow were going.
- Hey, Arrow, you think they'll be monsters?
I'd be just as happy if there weren't any monsters.
But, either way, no matter what happens, we've got to stick close together because we're really a team now.
Hey, you know what I hope?
I hope, oops.
Arrow!
Could this be the
Pointless Forest?
How can it be?
It's got to be.
But, if it is, how come everything's got a point?
The leaves are pointed.
The branches and twigs are too.
Everything.
Well, this is it, Arrow.
This is the beginning of the place we were banished to.
There's just one thing
I don't understand.
How are we suppose to get through this stuff to get in there.
It's so thick, it's like a jungle.
Good boy, Arrow, good boy.
Now, just follow me.
No, I'll follow you.
No, we'll go together.
That's the plan, we'll go together.
And whatever you do, don't leave me, Arrow.
- Oblio and
Arrow and just barely set out onto the road into the Pointless Forest when all of a sudden,
- Arrow, look, a man.
A pointed man.
Excuse me, sir.
We thought this was the Pointless Forest.
Quite right my boy, well noted, this is the place indeed.
By name, the
Pointless Forest.
- But what is a pointed man doing in the Pointless Forest?
- Listen to the lad, me pointed?
That's too funny.
You know, he's funny.
Me, a pointed man?
This news amuses me.
- But, sir, you're pointing right now, more than any...
- My boy, I'm not the pointed man you think I am.
I can point in every direction, sure, any fool can do the same, but a point in every direction, is the same as no point at all.
Would you argue the point,
I wouldn't, not on a bet, it never entered my mind.
- Suddenly, Oblio and Arrow were all alone in the Pointless Forest.
At first, everything seemed quite peaceful.
Oblio thought about the pointed man and wondered what his friends in the village would have said, if only they knew he had seen and talked to such a rare person.
Then, Oblio noticed how quiet it was.
Arrow noticed, too.
It was very quiet.
Then, little by little,
Oblio began to feel lonely.
- You know Arrow,
I was just thinking.
I mean, about that pointed man.
I don't know.
I think there's something a little funny about that man.
I mean, he's pointed, heck, he's always pointing.
Then he says he isn't a...
Arrow, hey Arrow,
I think I'm scared.
Hey, now what do you want to go and growl like that for?
Especially, when I told you I...
What is it, boy?
Wow, giant bees, run, Arrow, run for your life.
Arrow, what'll we do?
Wow.
Arrow, help!
What was that?
- I believe it was e flat, double style, extra fortissimo, don't you know it?
- Say, what's happening with you, boy?
You been goofing with the bees?
- Gosh, who are you?
- It's me, the Rock Man.
- I never saw a rock man before.
- Well, us stone folks are everywhere, just open your eyes and look around you.
- You mean there are more of you?
- Naturally, baby.
There's a whole family of us rock folk.
- Well, I was wondering if this is still the Pointless Forest.
- It isn't, Jack, they ain't nothin' pointless about this gig, just look around yourself, the birds singing sweet loves song to the trees, squirrels doing crazy digs all over the place.
Mother Nature, she watchin' over the whole scene, and dig me, taking it all in.
- Yeah, but...
- It's the here and now that I'm talkin' about, the smell of sweet life in the air.
It's the warm feel of the sun and the beat of music, just digging yourself.
- But, I can't see the...
- Well, you see what you want to see.
Tell me, did you ever see a dinosaur?
- No.
- Well, did you ever see a pterodactyl?
- No.
- Well, did you ever want to see a pterodactyl?
- I guess not.
- Well, that's it, you see what you want to see, and you hear what you want to hear.
- Gosh, Mr. Stone Man...
- It's Rock Man, Jim.
You gotta keep yourself in historical prospective.
- I mean Mr. Rock Man, well, you see, you're surrounding everything.
- Come on, boy.
Out with it, don't get yourself all racked up and jammed, you got a question?
Lay it on me, but let it out easy.
- It's just that everything's been happening so fast.
We were banished and then those bees.
- I can dig it,
I can dig it, yes.
Look, let me hip you to reality.
- I'd really rather know if this is still the Pointless Forest.
- Now, there you go again, pointless, that's the central issue of what I'm putting down for you cats.
- You gotta open your mind as well as your eyes, but first, you gotta get it together, you know, be cool, dig yourself.
Get the message?
Now, here's the lick.
You don't have to have a point to have a point, dig?
Now, I fear you've been getting some negative vibration from some place.
You gotta collect yourself, be cool, be steady as a rock.
- Steady as a rock?
- That's right, being a rock is a very heavy life.
Us rock folk are impervious to heat.
We stay cool, we're insusceptible to water, and that's cool, too.
- But, when it rains, isn't it true that even stones...
- Now there you go again.
You're tensing up.
Rain, yeah, sure, maybe rain turn a tree into a water log.
Sometimes rain make a river lose its flood control, but a rock in the rain is just cool, very cool.
- Boy, I never realized that rocks and stones were so...
- All you gotta do is open your mind along with your eyes.
Now, you gotta long road, son, so you remember what I say, okay?
- I will
Mr. Rock Man, I will.
- Play it easy, and remember as you make it through this forest, ain't necessary to posses a point, to have yourself a point.
- I'll remember that.
- Yeah, well I think I'm gonna take myself a short nod, you roll by this way again, just fall in, I'm only a stone's throw...
- It was awfully nice of
Rock Man to explain that to us, and I'll tell you something else,
I'll bet it's not everybody who gets to talk to rock folks.
You know, he really was a...
- My good lad, been rolling right along I see.
- Arrow, it's the pointed man again.
Hello, sir.
- What's this, still talking of points, my boy?
Seems he's obsessed.
I'll make a point of noting that.
- Your point, my son, love game!
- We've just met a man who's made of stone.
- Yes, excellent fellow, splendid chap, all you got a do is relax.
You gotta open your mind, that's cool,.
- He's a nice man.
He knows a lot, and he's generous and...
- He gave you gifts, a little remembrance, perhaps a small memento?
- No, he told me things.
He's interesting to talk to.
- Completely pointless, my boy.
In word, abstract.
To put it bluntly, sonny bob, pointless all pointless.
As they say, no point, a big zero, as they say.
- Hey wait for us, wait.
- Sometimes, you never know how really happy you are to see a person, until after he's gone.
That's pretty much the way Oblio felt when he realized the man who was always pointing had just up and disappeared.
- Jimminy, Arrow, that was a close call.
You gotta watch your step.
That hole could be
Holy cow, there's no bottom to this thing.
Arrow, you could have been...
Arrow.
Gosh, Arrow.

- The lad persists, a dogged trooper that boy, to say nothing of that boy's dog.
They pursue in pointless pursuit.
They're pursuit is pointless.
- Good boy, Arrow, you found him.
Hi, sir, we've been looking all over for ya.
What a pleasure, what a splendid surprise, thought you might be holed up somewhere.
- We were trying to catch up with you, and then we found this gigantic hole.
It was big and dark, and scary.
- And frankly, quite pointless.
- No, we learned a lot.
I know Arrow did, and so did I.
Old Arrow found out he's really gotta...
- Careful sonny, don't get in over your head.
It wouldn't do to bury yourself intellectually,
Point of fact, it never pays to submerge too deeply.
- What is it, Arrow?
- He must hear something.
- Well, of course he hears something, obvious.
- Come on boy, what's wrong?
What is it, Arrow?
It seems like he's trying...
Gone again.
Hey, hey Arrow, hey wait a minute, boy.
Arrow.
Arrow, come back
Arrow, wait for me.
Arrow.
Hey, hey Arrow.
Hey, wait a minute, boy.
Arrow.
Arrow, why did you have to go and...
Hey, Arrow, that sounds like singing.

Don't scare the ladies.
Sorry if he frightened you.
He didn't mean anything by it, really.
We were just watching you dance.
It looked great.
Excuse me, but who are you ladies?

- Thankless, wouldn't you say?
- You.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
- How's that?
Out with it boy, get it off your chest.
- The ladies, those three fat ladies, they way they danced and played and...
- Yes, quite pointless, wouldn't you say, fat, round, pointless, get it?
- No, they do have a point.
It's laughter and merriment and making each other happy.
- Really?
That's an interesting misconception, but then, I'm sure you'll agree.
- Hey, you, are you kidding?
For crying out loud, will you get out of there?
Not there, either.
For the love of Morris, what are you trying to do?
You trying to destroy me?
Will you back off?
What is this?
Will you stop fooling with that mutt and get away from those leaves, you pathetic nincompeep.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I didn't see you, and
I didn't realize...
- All right, all right, all right all ready.
As it happens, those are Sunday in the sunset leaves, a golden veneer and very rare, and you looked like you were just going to plow right...
- Gosh, I'm sorry, I never...
- You know, leaves like that don't just grow on trees or something.
- I really am sorry.
We thought we were just in the regular Pointless Forest.
This is still the
Pointless Forest, isn't it?
- Pointless? Pointless?
Just look at those leaves, each one more pointed than the last.
I tell you, this is the most pointed collection of...
- Then, you're a collector.
Golly, a leaf collector.
- A collector?
What, are you joking or something?
Who ever heard of a grown man going around collecting leaves?
That's weird.
What am I suppose to do, put them in a scrapbook?
- Well, I just thought...
- No, you didn't think.
We're in business here, business.
This isn't some game we're playing young man.
This is the real thing, and we gotta move.
- Jimminy, the leaf business.
I didn't know people sold leaves.
Well, I always thought...
- You thought, you thought, yeah, and while you're thinking I'm losing time, besides, I will do all the thinking around here.
- Gosh, sir, I...
- Listen, I can't talk now, young man.
It's go for broke time from here on in.
This is the time of year we put together a whole fall line.
- I'm afraid I don't know what a fall line is.
- It's the magic of the sorcerer and the excitement of the artist at the moment of creation.
It's when we turn green leaves into greenbacks, when the gold on those trees becomes gold in our pockets.
- You mean you're gathering all these leaves for...
- Gathering? Gathering?
I'm not a gatherer, sonny.
I'm manufacturer, and when you're in the manufacturing game, timing is everything.
You make it or break it on timing.
Sure, design counts, quality counts, maximizing total production potential, that counts.
They all count, but without good ol' timing it's so long Charlie.
- But, with leaves, how do you know if...
- Take the fall season, if
I brought it out in July, it's forget it, it's a distaster.
Timing, it's all timing.
All right, let me ask you something.
- Anything you want.
- You're interested, I like that, and you're sharp
I need people who are sharp.
Sure, I can get help, but good help, that's something else, again.
Question, is the world ready for a tweed leaf?
Stop and think.
- To tell you the truth,
I just don't know.
- I like that, you're honest.
Yes, timing and honesty, that's the name of the game.
All right, let's face it, this is a business just like any other business.
Anyone can learn a business, right?
But, honesty, you either got it or you ain't got it.
Where you from, what's bothering you?
- Excuse me sir, but don't leaves just make themselves?
Naturally, without any...
- My boy, you got a lot to learn.
Tell me, what nationality are you?
- Well, sir, I'm from the Pointed Village.
- That's funny, you don't look pointed.
- As it works out, I'm not, but my parents are.
- It's all right, don't give it a second thought, my boy.
I don't care what a man's faith, creed or color is. The only thing that matters to me is whether or not he can produce.
Well, what do ya say?
- About what?
- Are you in or not?
I'm offering you a chance to get into the leaf game.
- But, what could I do?
- Naturally, you'll have to start on the forest floor and work your way up, and I'll tell you one thing,
I don't want to ever see you or that clown of a dog of yours standing around on the product.
- We wouldn't, you can be sure of that.
- Great opportunity for you, my boy.
It can open doors for you, big doors.
Seasonal, yes we're seasonal, summer, winter, spring, fall.
You and your dog will work like dogs.
Rest?
You'll rest during the fifth season, and their isn't any fifth season, but there are rewards.
It's exciting, challenging work, manufacturing leaves.
- But that's just it, sir.
I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I don't see how
Arrow and I could...
- It's the simplest thing in the world, my boy.
You just plant your roots, right here with me, and by next season, you'll...
- But, we don't have any roots to plant, we aren't...
- No roots? No roots?
Well that just about tears it, doesn't it?
It's too bad, too.
You could've been up there with the best of 'em, kid.
Sunday in the sunset, leaf of gold, you name it, you could have had everything, and together, we would have been unstoppable.
We could have given
'em those tweed leaves, it could have been beautiful, beautiful.
- Boy, it sure sounds like it could've been.
But, something's kind of confusing me.
- Well, you just name it, son.
You can't get answers in this world, if you don't ask questions.
- It's just that I know there's a point to every leaf, but what's the point to all the leaves, your leaves?
- That confuses you, doesn't it?
Well, all of mankind is confused.
You work, you struggle, you fight to survive.
Little by little, you make something, you get ahead, and then one day you look, you see you got something, and I mean really something.
- But, what's the...
- Can't talk now, young man, gotta time problem that won't quit.
Yes, timing.
Timing, that's the name of the game.
- No Arrow, let's go around. Who knows, these could belong to the Leaf Man, too, and you know how he is about stepping on his product.
- That's quite right my boy, watch your step, what ever you do don't bring a leave to grief.
It's branch might blanch, worse yet, it's trunk might go kerplunk.
- Mr. Pointed Man, you should have been with us.
We met a very important business man.
- Was he out raking leaves, perhaps?
This brilliant industrialist, this extraordinary tycoon, ho, ho, ho, he, he, he.
My good lad, your manufacturer is a bust.
His product is so un-unique, it has to be completely pointless.
- No, he's a very industrious industrialist, and he never rests, and he always...
- My boy, he's spinning his wheels.
To put it concisely, his work is futile.
In a manner of speaking, it's pointless.
- That can't be, he told me that...
- Sunday in the sunset, today tweed, tomorrow herringbone.
The man's a lunatic.
He's mad, clearly a case of dementia.
- But he was nice, he offered me a chance to...
- He's a King among me.
He's a prince of a fellow.
I pass, pair of jacks, ace high, in sum, my good lad, pointless, pointless.
- I don't see how you can keep saying that about everybody.
I mean, just because you don't...
- Careful, boy, don't jump to any rash conclusions.
You could land on thin ice, and come up all wet if you follow the image I've drawn.
That could be a chilling experience.
- Little by little, Oblio was learning a good deal about the Pointless Forest and it's unusual residents, but unfortunately for him, and Arrow too, his knowledge couldn't possibly help him anticipate what was hovering directly above.
No, Oblio had absolutely no way of knowing what was in the wind.
Hey.
Hey.
Gee, Arrow, I always thought of a forest as a bunch of tree trunks, but it's a lot more.
It's treetops, and horizons, and hills and meadows and everything.
Man, this is great.
- You know something, this bird could mean real trouble now.
- Aw, Dad, they'll be okay.
- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
- What can an old bird do?
- Well, you're not up there, hanging on for dear life.
- Aw, come on Dad.
You know he's not going to let him drop.
- Well, I don't know that.
I don't know that, and you don't either.
You don't know how dependable he is.
Why, he could very easily...
- Nah, Dad, not a bird that size.
- A bird what size?
- Well, didn't you mention something about a huge bird?
I thought you said...
- You know, when I was a kid, my dad read to me, and I listened, and I listened closely.
I didn't go around interpreting things.
- Yeah, okay Dad.
- I didn't jump to conclusions.
- That's good, Dad.
- I don't know what's happened to kids now days.
You give 'em everything.
You offer to read to 'em.
I don't know, I just don't know.

- Back to earth again, Arrow.
We made it safe and sound.
- As Oblio circled the mammoth egg, he was overcome with a strange sensation.
He looked at the egg, very closely, examining it again and again, but each time, his conclusions were exactly the same.
- Hey, this is weird.
Just when I was sort of starting to think that this Pointless Forest isn't pointless at all, we come across something that really is pointless, at least it sure looks like it is.
- You see, after each one of his adventures in the forest, Oblio always found himself left with a sort of free-floating feeling, that there was some sort of point to what he had experienced.
Even though it had happened in a Pointless Forest.
- A point.
Arrow, I was right in the first place.
Even a thing like this, a thing that looks like it's all round has some sort of point.
Hi, little fella.
I mean, big fella.
Are you all right?
Well, I'm Oblio, and this guy right here's my dog.
His name's Arrow.
What, are you saying what?
Well, what happened is you just got hatched.
You're born now, but don't worry, it happens to everybody, you'll be okay.
Where, is he saying where, Arrow?
That's a little harder.
You see, the name of this place is the Pointless Forest.
That's where we are, all right, but I'll tell you something,
I'm starting to think that instead of being pointless, this forest is full of points.
Take you for instance, sure, you've got a pointed beak, but that's just a point, any one can see that.
Your real point, well, that's something else again.
Why?
That's the hardest one to answer.
That's what I always want to know, why.
And that's the question everyone always asks.
- Splendid idea, my boy.
I'd like mine over easy, with a side-order of bacon, if you please, very crisp and coffee, the old mocca java!
I had a hunch you'd be serving brunch.
And perhaps an apricot danish.
- Mr. Pointed Man,
I'm glad you're here, but how come that nice new bird's mother took him away like that?
We were just talking about the why of everything, why this, why that, and just when
I was thinking that...
- Now, there you go again, you're thinking, that's very destructive, my lad, most destructive indeed.
If a person does enough thinking, a certain amount of knowledge is sure to follow.
The results, sonny bob, could be a life of misery.
- But, I can't help it,
I haven't been trying to think.
Things just sort of start popping up in my mind.
They occur to me out of...
- Thoughts just start popping up into your mind, ideas formed without any effort on your part?
You find that concepts simply conceptualize?
- Well, yes.
- That's grim.
- It started way back when I met the rock man.
- It's a disaster.
- And it just kept on happening.
- Mayday, it's a complete mayday.
- I was hoping maybe you could help me figure out just exactly...
- There's really nothing more that I can do.
You're out of my hands,
I tried to help you boy.
I can show you the pointlessness of it all, but you wouldn't listen.
- Sir, I hope you don't think I'm ungrateful.
- You had to go digging around, didn't ya?
You had to let thoughts slip into your head.
You're lost lad, lost.
The kid blew it, had everything going for him, and he blew it.
The fact is, my boy, that it's under the circumstances, there's no place in the
Pointless Forest for you.
- But, where will
I go, what will I do?
I can't go home again, the Count had me banished.
- Ta ta, jolly bye, ciao bucky, ciao.
- Golly, gone again.
I wonder where he goes when he does that.
- Vanishing Point, ol' man, correct, the Vanishing Point, just another one of the facilities.
Well, adieu, fare thee well, you take care of yourself, ya hear?
- So long, sir.
- Oblio watched as the Pointed Man disappeared, but unlike all the other times, he was not especially overwhelmed by what he saw.
- I think he's really gone this time, Arrow.
Arrow?
Arrow?
Here, boy.
Arrow?
I hear you boy, but where are you?
He's gone.
Stay where you are, Arrow.
Don't move, I'll find ya.
I know I will.
Good boy, Arrow.
Come on boy, you're all right now.
Come on, Arrow.
- It had been a full day for the two travelers, a very full day.
For Oblio, it had been one adventure after another, of course, it had been pretty adventurous for Arrow, too.
- That Vanishing Point, it only made it so I couldn't see.
It didn't make it so you weren't really there.
I'm starting to think that the Pointed Man, nice as he was, was realy about the only pointless person we've met in this whole Pointless Forest.
Sure, he did an awful lot of talking, and it all sounded very fine, almost like the Count in a way, and after all, what's such a big deal about having a point on your head?
Nothing against you,
Arrow, you're great.
But, I sort of think what's in your head is a lot more important.
It sure gets dark fast, doesn't it?

- But, I miss him,
I miss my Oblio.
- Yeah, he was a great little guy.
- And I'm worried about him.
- That little guy, nah, he'll do great out there.
- But he's so young.
- Yeah, but he's sharp, he's sharp.
He's young, but he's sharp.
- We should have never let them send him away.
- Yeah, well, go tell the Count that,
I mean, it was the law, dear.
- It's a bad law.
- Well, good law, bad law, what difference does it make?
It's the law.
- It makes all the difference.
A good law never would have sent my Oblio away, never.
- Dear, the law is the law.
- Well, you should have challenged it.
- What, I should have challenged it?
- We all should have.
- Law, I mean, but, but the Count came right out and said...
- The Count, the Count.
What about my Oblio?
- Well, look, I mean,
I'm just one man, I...
- We should have all stood up.
Even the King seemed like he was against...
- Well, maybe you're right, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should have tried.
- He's so young.
- What, the King?
- My little Oblio.
- Oblio, Oblio, it's Oblio.
Hey, it's Oblio
- Welcome home Oblio.
- We're glad you're back, Oblio.
- You tell 'em Ob, break it down for 'em.
- Come by the shop, Oblio.
I have some butter balls for you, round, competely round.
- Hello, Oblio.
- There he is, there's Oblio.
- My baby, my Oblio.
- Well, hi son.
Hi, Oblio.
- On to the palace.
- To the King.
- Your majesty, your majesty, there's a mob at the palace gate.
- Mob?
Well, that's pretty hard to believe.
- Well, it's true, you know what a mob is.
Shall I call out the palace guard?
- Well, that does seem a bit excessive, doesn't it?
- Well, what do you suggest?
Send out a pastry tray, and let them eat cake?
- Well, that's never worked before.
Tell me, what does your intelligence agency make of it?
- Nothing yet, nothing.
They're still trying to infiltrate the crowd, but I'll tell you one thing, according to my son, it's all for that kid, that twerpy, round-headed Oblio.
- Oblio?
You mean little Oblio, who we...
- Yes, my son claims he's come back.
- Really?
Oblio, little Oblio is back?
- This is gravely serious, my dear King.
- Yes, it is.
You know something, Count?
You may have misread the will of the people in that Oblio case.
An unruly mob?
Well, isn't that just the limit?
- Silence, I demand silence.
Can't a man get a little peace and quiet in his own...
Say, what are you doing back?
This litle runt is an outlaw.
You're an outlaw, child.
You are banished to the Pointless Forest.
- And I went to the
Pointless Forest, in fact I...
- Nonsense, sheer, irrevocable, nonsense.
I'll have you in chains for this.
Arrest this little...
- Hold it, hold it, Count, the boy was saying something.
- Yeah, right on, break it down for him, Obi.
- Yes, right on Obi.
- Well, sir, we did go to the Pointless Forest,
Arrow and I, all through it, in fact.
And you know something?
It isn't pointless at all.
- It's not?
- What?
What?
Not pointless?
Madness.
That's madness.
Sheer madness.
- Will you be quiet, Count?
I want to hear Oblio.
Now, Oblio, you were saying?
- Well, the fact is, sir, just about everything we ran into had a point to it, the leaves, the trees, everything.
- I see, Obi, well, I can't really argue that one with you, but what about yourself, son?
- Well, sir, I figure if everything has a point, then I must have one, too.
- He has a point there.
Villain, treason, public naughtiness.
I will not stand by while this pointless person tries to undo the law of the land.
My dear and loyal friends, if he had a point, he'd have one.
Impossible.
- And so it was, that Oblio and Arrow returned safely from their travels, only a little older, but certainly a good deal wiser.
As for the Pointed Village, well, the way things worked out, it was a much better place to live after Oblio's return.
True, the people didn't have their once cherished points, right there on top of their heads, put that didn't matter so much anymore.
People just started assuming that every man had some kind of a point, whether it shows or not.
- The end.
Now that's a story son, is that a story, or...
- Yeah, Dad, it was a good story, really.
- Good, good, it was great, great story.
- Sure, Dad, it was.
- I mean it had everything right there, adventure, a little comedy, funny scene or two.
There was a lesson.
You caught the lesson, didn't you?
- Right, Dad, I caught it.
- Well, what do you think it was?
- Well, just because somebody doesn't have what other people have doesn't mean that you know, they have to be turned out of the kingdom, or something.
- Yes.
- Dad?
- What is it, son?
- Thanks for reading me the story.
- You're welcome, son.

Milo (reluctantly): (Sighs) Hello Ralph.
Ralph: Hi, Milo. Are you doing anything?
Milo: Nah. I'm not doing anything. 
What's there to do?
Ralph: Nothing I guess. Nothing is fun any more.
Milo: Right! Everything's a big waste of time.
When I'm in school. all I want to do is be out. 
When I'm not in school, I wanna be someplace else.
(Sighs) If only something could happen some time.
Ralph: Yeah.
Milo (muffled): What's the use of subtracting turnips from turnips? Or carrying a 3?
Or knowing how to spell February. Feb-ru-ary!
Ralph: Yeah, everything's a drag.
And who wants to sit around doing homework anyway?
Milo: Everything seems so impossible.
(Sighs) Everybody says it's such a big wonderful world.
How come it seems it so-- small? 
And kind of empty?
(Sighs) There's no rhyme or... or reason to any of it.

Milo: Turnpike tollbooth?
Tollbooth: For use by those who have never traveled in the land beyond!
Milo: Beyond? Beyond what?
Tollbooth: Beyond your wildest imagination, of course! (Tollbooth Chuckles)

Tollbooth: One book of rules and traffic regulations.
One map, up to date, and carefully drawn by a master cartographer.
And precautionary signs to be used in a precautionary manner.
Have your destination in mind.
Milo: I don't think I have a destination.
Tollbooth: Rule #8a. All travelers must have a destination. 
No journey is valid without a destination.
Find one on your map, Milo.

Milo (Talking to Himself): Castle in the Air. 
Might as well go there as anywhere.
Milo (to Tollbooth): Castle in the Air.
Tollbooth (Speaking Like Train Conductor):

Milo: Dictionopol-,Digitop- How far is it? 
Maybe I don't want to go-
Tollbooth: Well Milo, make up your mind. 
Going or staying?
Tollbooth (impatiently): Well??

Milo: This is crazy. Here I am, riding along a road I've- I've never seen, going to a place I've never heard of.
I wonder where I am, anyway.

Milo (Speaking): What a funny name!
(Siren Blaring)
Officer Shrift: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
I've never seen anyone so guilty!
Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow down or I'll arrest the lot 'o ya.
Milo: How can I slow down? I'm not even moving.
Shrift: Oh, it's you is it? I mighta known it'd be a boy.
Talking back to an officer, that's a misdemeanor. 
Where were you on the night of July 25th? Hmm?
Milo: July 25th? Wha- What's that got to do with it?
Shrift: Do with it?? It's my birthday.
That's what it's got to do with it!
Boys are always forgetting people's birthdays.
Milo: Well, I'm sorry...
Shrift: You have committed the following crimes-"underceding" the speed limit, a misdemeanor.
Milo: But I wasn't even moving!
Shrift: Wasn't even moving, eh?
"Overstructing" traffic, a felony.
Milo: Look, you can't do this! I wasn't doing anything.
Shrift: Not doing anything. 
I think you'll admit at your age, that's a crime.
Now then, would you like a long sentence, or a short sentence?
Milo: Well, I..I suppose a short one. 
If I have a choice.
Shrift: How about "I am."?
It's the shortest sentence I know.
Milo: It's- it's very kind of you to give me such a - a short sentence.
Shrift: And just when would you like to go to prison and start serving it?
Milo: Ser- serving it? Oh, oh well I uh-
I suppose I really can't until I get back from
Diction-opolis and the Castle in the Air.

Milo (Reading): Welcome to Expectations.
(Speaking): Expectations?
Boy. They sure have a way of naming places around here.
Milo (Reading): Information, predictions, and advice- truthfully offered.
Milo (speaking): Well that's one thing I could certainly use, is a little information.
("Milo, Open Your Eyes" Music 
Plays in Background)
Milo (Reading): Park here and blow horn.
(Speaking) Alright. 
Whether Man: My, My, My, My, My, My. Welcome, welcome, welcome, to the land of expectations.
Um, to the land of expectations.
Whether Man: We don't get many travelers these days. 
We certainly don't get many travelers these days.
Now what can I do for you? I'm the Whether Man.
Milo: How do you do sir. I wonder if-
Could you tell me where the right road to a 
-a Diction-opolis or- or someplace...
Whether Man: Dictionpolis? Well now, well now, well now. 
I don't know of any wrong road to Dictionopolis, so if this road goes to Dictionopolis at all, it must be the right road. Don't you think?
And if it doesn't, it must be the right road to somewhere, mustn't it?
Because there are no wrong roads to anywhere.
Do you think it'll rain?
Milo: But I thought you said you were the "weather" man.
(Scooting Noise)
Whether Man: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm the whether man, not the weather man.
For after all, it's more important to know whether there will be a change in the weather, than what the weather will be, don't you think?
Upbeat Music Begins
Milo: What kind of place is- I mean- what kind of place is Expectations?
Whether Man: Good question.
Splendid question.
Expectations is the place you must always go- before you get where you're going.
Of course some people never get beyond Expectations.
But my job is to hurry them along anyway.
So I'd better hurry you along, too.
Milo: Thank you. Thank you. Buh- But I, I really think
I can- I can find my own way.
Whether Man: Splendid. Splendid. Splendid. 
I do so hate to make up my mind about anything.
Whether or not you find your way, you're bound to find some way.
If you happen to find my way, please return it. 
You did say it was going to rain, didn't you?
Milo: Boy. That's the most peculiar man I've ever met.
I hope I'll meet somebody whose sentences make as much sense backwards as forward.

Milo: (Yawns) What a nice, sleepy day.
Maybe that old tollbooth had something after all.

No decisions to make.

Lethargians (reverberating voices): 
You're in Doldrums.
Milo: The- what drums?
Lethargians (reverberating-echoing each other):
Welcome to the...Doldrums. (Snoring)
Lethargians: Allow me to introduce you...
We are the Letharges. (Snores)
Milo: I'm very pleased to meet you.
Uh- Could you help me, please? I think I'm lost.
Lethargians: Think?! Don't...say... that. 
It's against the law to think in the Doldrums.
Milo (Yawning): That's ridiculous. 
Everybody thinks.
Lethargians: We don't. And most of the time, you don't. 
And that's why you're here. You weren't thinking.
And you weren't paying attention, either. People who don't pay attention often get stuck in the Doldrums...(Snores)
Milo: Hahaha. That's silly. 
Hahaha!
Lethargians: Stop that at once! 
Laughing is against the law.
And smiling is permitted only on alternate Thursdays.
Milo: But if you can't laugh or think, what can you do in the Doldrums?
Lethargians: Do? Why? You can do anything...
(Singing): As long as it's nothing.
Everything, as long as it isn't anything.
So... don't say there's nothin' to do in the Doldrums.
Don't say we don't (snores) days..
We dawdle a bit... and then
(Speaking): Yeah and then we-
We loiter a while, 
...and dawdle again.
(Lethargians Snore)
We gather our strength...to start anew.
On all of the loafing and lounging we still have left (yawn) to do.
So don't say there's nothing to do in the Dol...drums,
It's just...not...true.
(Milo Yawns,
Lethargians Snore)
Milo (Yawning): I can see you... lead a rich and... productive life.
Milo (Singing): Don't say there's nothing to do in the Dol...drums!
Milo: I'm ready to diddle away the days, I am!
Lethargians: The days we don't,
Milo: I doddle a bit. Lethargians: Doddle a bit.
Milo: And then.. Lethargians: Doddle a bit.
Milo (Yawning): I loiter awhile.
Lethargians: Loiter awhile.
Milo (yawning heavily): And doddle again.
Lethargians: And dod--doddle again.
Milo: I gather my strength.
Lethargians (mumbling): Gather strength.
Milo: To start anew.
Lethargians: to start anew.
Milo: On all of the loafing and lounging
I still have left to do.

Tock: Here, what's this? 
What are you doing here?
Milo (Yawns): Just killing time.
Tock: Killing time?!?!
Tock: Look son, it's bad enough wasting time without killing it. Come on, get ahold of yourself!
You can't spend the rest of your life in the Doldrums.
How did you get here anyway?
Milo (Yawning): Ah, it was easy.
I guess I just wasn't thinking.
Tock: Heh. Precisely. You got here by not thinking, and now you've got to think your way out.
Milo: (Sighs) Go away. I was sleep...
Milo: Besides, it's against the law to think.
(Dramatic Music Plays)
(Lethargians Growl)
Tock: You've got to get out of here, quick!
I know you haven't had much practice, but you've got to start thinking!
(Lethargians Growl)
Milo: ..Too much work to think. (Yawns)
I'd rather not do...(yawns) anything.
Tock: The Lethargians don't want you to do anything, even eating or breathing.
Milo: Breathing? But I've always breathed!
I can't stop now.
Tock: Then get started thinking. Think boy, think!
Milo: What do I think about?
Tock: Think of birds that swim, and fish that fly.
Milo: Uh, let's see. Birds that swim... (Ding)
And fish that fly...(Ding)
Tock: Words that begin with "J."
Tock: It's working, it's working! Keep thinking!

(Begins Normal Ticking After Tock Turns It Off)
Tick: Whew. For a minute I was afraid
I'd snapped my main spring.
You must excuse my gruff conduct, but you see it's traditional for watch dogs to be ferocious.
Milo: I thought you were just great, but are you sure it's alright...to leave those Lethargians back there alone?
Tock: Oh, I don't just watch Lethargians, I watch boys too. And right now, I'd say, you needed a watchdog.
And anyway I just love automobile rides!
Milo: I'm very pleased to have you along.
My name is Milo.
Tock: Milo. That's a strange name for a boy.
My name is Tock.
Milo: Well, I mean uh-well- isn't that kind of a strange name...for a dog?
Tock: Oh, no. How many names can you give a watchdog?
Actually, my name is Tick-Tock.
My friends call me Tock.
Milo: May I call you Tock?
It's about time I had a friend.
Tock: It's about time. Time? 
But time is your friend.
Time marches on, time and tide wait for no man-
Tock (Singing): Time. Time. Time. Time.
Time is a gift, fleeting and swift,
Ticking and tocking itself away,
Itself away, a way of saying better beware,
Time is a gift, precious and rare, 
Take it and make of it all you can.
Use all you can, there's not a moment to spare.
So, take a second to look around,
See a sight, hear a sound.
Take a minute to concentrate, 
Analyze...Contemplate!
Take an hour and change the fate of the world!
Time is a gift, given to you,
Given to give you the time you need,
The time you need to have the time of your life!
Time ticks hastily away,
Take time to save it every day!
Time saved, in the nick of time,
Is golden time.
Milo: Time, time, time, time.
(Milo and Tock Begin Doing Rounds,

Tock: Time...of your life.
Milo/Tock together:
The time you need to have the time of your life....!
Milo: Golly! I've never seen such a- 
...a beautiful country, Tock. What country is it?
Tock: Well, it used to be called the Kingdom of Wisdom, until the old King died.
But then, it was divided into two states. On one side, Dictionopolis, the Kingdom of Words.
It's ruled by King Azaz, who has an iron law that all words are more important than numbers.
The other side is Digitopolis, the Kingdom of Mathematics, ruled by the Mathemagician.
His law is that numbers are more important than words.
And over there, in the mountains of ignorance, the demons are gathering, just waiting...
(Thunder Roars)
And beyond those mountains, Milo, is our only chance.
The C-a-s-t-l-e in the A-i-r.
Milo: Well that's where I'm going.
The Castle in the Air.
Tock: Don't say that again, Milo.
It makes the demons very angry.
But at least there's one sane and intelligent man left in this country: Chroma the Great.
That's one of his best rainbows.
Milo: Hey! There goes the Whether Man.
Whether Man: Have you found my way yet?
I hope it isn't mildewed.
Tock: Come on, Milo. Let's go. We're wasting ti-
Milo: I know, I know. We're wasting time.

KAD: Noise, noise! Marvelous noise!
KAD: Horrible, hideous. Awful, insidious-
KAD: Noise, noise, noise!
KAD: You don't look well my boy.
KAD: Hey here, let's have a look at you (Horn Honks)
KAD: Just as I suspected, you are suffering from a severe lack of noise.
KAD: Now, this'll fix you right up.
KAD: Honking horns, screeching trains, bells, shouts,
KAD: Shrieks, gurgling drains. And all the rest of-
KAD: -those wonderfully unpleasant sounds we use so much of today.
KAD: Now here, take this and you'll never have to hear a pleasant sound again.
Milo: No! No- no thank you. I don't want to be cured of pleasant sounds.
KAD: Well now, that's very unusual. 
However, nothing odd.
KAD: I'll just give it the Awful Dynne.
Milo: The Awful Dynne? *(Din).
Dynne: Whoa hahaha! Ahhh, that was good, Master.
KAD: This is my assistant, the Awful Dynne.
Milo: Gee, I don't think I've ever met an awful Dynne before.
KAD: What?? Never met an Awful Dynne before? 
Oh you must be mistaken.
When you're playing in your room and making a lot of noise, what do they tell you to stop?
Milo: Why, the- the awful din! (Dynne Laughs)
KAD: And when the street is being repaired with about 50 jackhammers going all day, (Jackhammer Noise)
KAD...what does everybody complain of?
Milo: The awful din!
KAD: Right, and now my valued assistant will show you var-de-ous (*various) examples from my rare, exotic, and seldom heard...noises.
Dynne? (Horn Honks)

Dynne: Didja...ever hear an elephant tap dance, on a tin roof late at night? / That's noise...beautiful noise!
Did you ever hear a centipede crying...when his shoes don't fit him right? / That's noise... beautiful noise!
Did you ever hear a hungry dinosaur hiccup on a windy day?
Did you ever hear a nervous butterfly nibble on a cheese soufflé?
(Carnival Music, Awful Dynne Laughs)
KAD: Ah, yes. Noise is very fashionable today!
Why I can hardly fill the orders for noise pills, racket lotion, clamor salve, and hubbub tonic!

But today, all they want is -

Milo: Why ye- yes, sir.
Vendor: Well, (laughing) I'll tell you what, lad.
Why don't you just take a bag full of happys and goods to start with?
Very useful for Happy Birthday, Happy New Year, happy days, and happy-go-lucky.

Bee: Be the "e" of good hope. H-O-P-E.
Shrift: You'll find it quite pleasant down here.
Milo: Isn't it a little dark?
Shrift: Of course it's dark. Dungeons are always dark. If they weren't dark, they wouldn't be so unpleasant.
Milo: But you said it would be pleasant down here.
Which-
Shrift: Precisely. Which (*Witch).
You can always chat with a Which if you get lonely.
Shrift: This is it, all the comforts of home.
(Door Creaks/Slams) See you in six million years!
Frightening Music Plays
Which: Oh, there you are! How do you do?
Milo: (hesistates) Hello.
Which: Come in, come in, come in.
Milo: You'd better be very careful, m'am.
There's a witch around here somewhere.
Which: Well, of course there is! I am she.
Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.
There, you see? Official Which: Kingdom of Wisdom.
Milo: Oh, a Which! Like the Whether Man.
Which: Of course! The Whether Man is my brother.
At least he used to be.
I don't know whether he still is,
I haven't seen him in years!
Have a cookie.
The question marks are delicious!
Milo: What does a Which do?
Which: Well, I used to help people choose which words to use-
Which were the most proper and fitting words for any and all occasions.
But when Rhyme and Reason were banished-
Milo: Rhyme? And Reason?
Which: Yes, Milo. When the two kings had their terrible quarrel-
(Adventerous Music Begins)
Which: When King Azaz insisted that words were far more important than numbers, and hence his kingdom was truly the greater, and when Mathemagician claimed that numbers were much more important than words, and therefore his kingdom was supreme, why then naturally, they asked the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, and the Princess of Pure Reason to settle the question.
Milo: And what did they decide? What is the most important? Words or numbers?
Which: The princesses decided that words and numbers are of equal value.
Tock: In the cloak of knowledge, one is the warp and the other in the woof.
Which: But you see Milo, this decision infuriated the two kings, and they banished the princesses to the 
Castle in the Air. (Dramatic Music Plays)
And I was thrown into this dungeon.
Tock: And that's why people don't seem to care anymore which words they use, as long as they use lots of 'em.
Milo: And that's why there's no rhyme or reason around here, and everybody thinks he's so good!
Hey! Maybe we can rescue them, and rescue you too Mrs. Faintly...in about six million years.
Soldier L: Ah, there you are.
Soldier M: Where have you been?
Soldier N: Been looking all over for you.
Soldier O: Royal banquet is about to begin.
Soldier P: Soup's on.
Milo: I still have to serve my sentence of six million years in prison.
Soldier L: No time for sentences.
Soldier M: No time for words.
Soldier N: Condemn boy to hearty meal.
Soldier O: Prisons are for the birds.
Soldier P: Jailbirds.
Soldier L: Mustn't keep Azaz waiting.
Soldier M: Things get hungry, too.
Soldier N: Royal banquet's just beginning.
Soldier O: Just in time for royal stew.
Soldier P: Chow (Ciao).
Milo: Goodbye Mrs. Macabre, don't worry.
I'll find a way to rescue you.
(Cheerful Music)
Tock: Bye, Faintly. We'll be back.
Soldier: His Majesty, the Supreme Ruler of Semantics,
Most Eminent Chieftain of Participles,
Lord and Master of Words, Super Sovereign of Syntax,
Chief Potentate of Adverbs and Prepositions.
(Soldier P Whizzing to Grab Chair)
King Azaz the Unabridged.
Milo: If you please, sir.
(Azaz Bristles At "Sir")
Milo: Your majesty. My name is Milo, <br/>and this is Tock, my watchdog.
And we've been sentenced to six million years for-
Azaz: Ahhh! Six million?
That's not a sentence, that's a number.
It's against the law to mention numbers here in Dictionopolis. Words are the only things that matter.
Milo: I'm sorry your kingship, sir.
Azaz: After all, me boy-
(Singing) You couldn't have one fine day without the "day," could you?
You couldn't have tea for two without the "tea," could you?
You couldn't have three blind mice, without the "mice," could you?
So you see, Milo, words are really, very valuable things.
If you think a great thought, how do you write it down?
Words!
If you spot a brush fire, how do you warn the town?
Words!
If you have opinions, how do you speak your piece?
If you rent a castle, how do you read your lease?
If you know a good joke, how do you tell a friend?
Words, words! That's how.
Words in a word are amazing. You can read 'em, you can write 'em, you can sing 'em,
and recite 'em, underline them. Misdefine them.
They're amazing!
Words in a word are fantastic!
You can hint 'em, you can say 'em, you can print 'em, you can pray 'em.
Emphasize them and despise them. They're fantastic!
String them into sentences and thoughts profound.
We'll abound, in a symphony of spoken sound, truth is found, beauty crowned.
In other words, words in a word are delicious!
You can taste 'em, you can treat 'em, you can waste 'em, you can 'eat em.
And digest them, I suggest them!
They're delicious!
(King Sighs) Words.
 (Music Ends Dramatically)
Azaz: Speechers, speechers. Time for speeches.
You my boy, as our guest, may speak first.
Milo (clears throat): Your Majesty, uh Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity-
Azaz (claps): Enough, next.
Tock: Soup bones, dog biscuits, porter house steak, carpet slippers.
Humbug: Roast turkey, mashed potatoes, vanilla ice cream.
Soldier L: Veal Cutlet Parmesan.
Soldier M: Eggplant Florentine.
Soldier N: Eggs goldenrod.
Soldier O: Jones sausage, "reosh."
Azaz: Pate de foie gras, soupe a l'oignon, faisan sous cloche, salade endive, fromages et fruits et demi-tasse."
(Servants Marching, 
Music in Rhythm with Chewing)
Food (whispering): Your majesty, ladies and-
Milo: But that's my speech!
I didn't know I was going to have to eat my words.
King (chewing): Of- of course you do.
That's what we're all doing.
(Chews). You, you, you should have made a tastier speech.
(Gasps). I seem to have a touch of indigestion.
Milo: Perhaps you've eaten too much too quickly.
Azaz: Too be sure, too much, too quickly.
I most certainly haven't eaten too little, too slowly.
Or too much, too slowly. Or too little, too quickly.
Or taken all day to eat nothing.
Or eaten everything in no time at all.
Milo: But wouldn't that be just as bad?
Azaz: You mean just as good.
Things which are "just as bad" also are equally good.
Try to look at the bright side of things, Milo.
Milo: I don't know what side of anything to look at. 
Everything is so confusing!
And all your words only make things worse.
Azaz: How true.
Words seem to have lost their meaning.
Milo: But there must be something you can do about it.
Couldn't you pass a law- or something?
Azaz: We have almost as many laws as we have words, but the laws don't make any sense either.
Milo: Perhaps you might allow- I mean uh, because you are a wise and -and righteous and just king, you might allow...Rhyme and- and Reason to return?
Azaz: How nice that would be...
No! No, no never!
Not while that stubborn brother of mine...
(*Gently) Things always did go very well when they were here.
(*Gruffly) I won't allow it!
Milo: Why not?
Azaz: (Gently) Why not?
(Gruffly) Why not, indeed!
Azaz: (Gently) Yes. Why not? 
My boy,
I cannot tell you how it would solve all our problems, if only you could bring back Rhyme and Reason.
Bee: Odious wasp, eh? (Bee Zooms)
Bee: Didactic Drone?
Bee: Parsimonious word miser, is it?
Azaz: Perhaps someone else among my faithful court would volunteer to join this brave boy in his efforts to rescue Rhyme and Reason?
(Music of Dismay Plays)
Azaz: No volunteers?
Bee: Insectious Humbugious, ey? We'll see.
Azaz: Wonderful! A volunteer!<br/>Congratulations.
Milo: That's great! With the Humbug's help, 
I know we can do it!
Azaz: Goodbye, my boy. Here, in this bag, <br/>are all the words and ideas I know.
With them, you may ask all the questions which <br/>have never been answered.
And answer all the questions which <br/>have never been asked.
All the great books of the past, <br/>and all the ones yet to come, are in that bag.
Go now. But remember, use these words well,<br/>and there is no obstacle you cannot overcome.
Azaz: Goodbye.
Milo/Tock: Goodbye!
Milo: And thank you. Goodbye!
Azaz: Goodbye! (Music Begins)
Humbug: Owwwwww!!!!
Milo: Wow, what a mess!
How will we ever get through that?
(Music of Confidence)
(Humbug Knocks/Kicks Wood)*
Humbug: It is of no use my lad.
The wall is absolutely impenetrable.
However, your heroic effort shall not be unrewarded. 
Our eternal gratitude will be yours.
Shall we start back?
Milo: Now look here, Mr. Humbug.
If you think for one minute that-
Dodecahedron: I say young man, what seems to be your problem?
Milo: Who are you?
Dodecahedron: My angles are many, my sides are not few. I'm the Dodecahedron, and who are you?
Milo: What's a dode-kaheadrun?
Tock: As I remember it, it's a twelve-sided mathematical shape.
Dodecahedron: See for yourself. I usually use one at a time... saves wear and tear.
By the way, what was your problem?
Milo: We have to get to Digitopolis to ask the Mathema-
Dodecahedron: The only way to get there is through the Numbers Mine.
Milo: Numbers Mine? But we can't get through there.
The entrance is blocked tight.
Tock: Milo, you remember how you got us out of the Doldrums?
Milo: Yeah, maybe we can think our way through!
Dodecahedron: Can you remember any mathematics?
Milo: Let's see. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.
Dodecahedron: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 is known as the-
Milo: Fibonacci Series!
Dodecahedron: Vectors have both magnitude and directions...
Milo: Scalars have only magnitude!
Milo: We did it, we did it!
Humbug: (Laughs) Yes, yes.
We handled that brilliantly, my boy.
'Tis a good thing we knew the Fibonacci Series, eh?
(Laughs) Yes, ee-dee.
Milo: Golly. And I used to think numbers weren't important or valuable.
Mathemagician: Not important? Not valuable?
Humbug: It's- it's the Mathemagician.
Mathemagician: By the 4,827, 659 hairs on my head,
I'll tell you what's important.
Mathemagician (singing): You couldn't have 1 fine day without the 1, could you?
You couldn't have tea for 2 without the 2, could you?
You couldn't have 3 blind mice without the 3, so you see?
Numbers are the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-
Wonders of the World!
If you had a big plan, how would you know how big?
Numbers!
If you had a high hope, how would you know how high? 
Numbers!
If you had a deep bog, how would you know how deep?
If you had a close call, how would you know how close?
If you had a wide choice, how would you know how wide?
Numbers! Numbers! That's how!
Numbers can be decimated, verified, manipulated, carried forward, backward, and replaced.
Numbers can be added to, subtracted from, divided into, multiplied by, crossed out, and erased.
But not with words. 
You're stuck with words.
Words are things you have to keep, have to watch, have to weigh, have to mind, have to know, have to say.
(Singing) But it's amazing what a digit or two can do.
Why anything you cannot figure out, they figure out for you.
And when troubles mount and they become too much to bear.
Never Fear.
(Talking) Just divide them and divide them.
And divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, until they disappear.
Nothing counts like numbers. Numbers! 
Numbers, wonderful numbers!
Those Dewey decimal dearies, square root and mix them in series,
They give the heart inspiration, no words can bring such elation!
1 to 9, they're the most.
Pour the wine, drink a toast to-
Numbers!
(Music Ends Dramatically)
Mathemagician: Welcome to my workshop!
Humbug: Very impressive, Your Majesty.
But, could you show us the biggest number there is? <br/>Heh, heh. That will give him something to figure out.
Mathemagician: Very well, Sir Humbug.
What's the biggest number you can think of?
Humbug: 9,999,999, 000,999 and 9/10.
Mathemagician: Very good. Now add 1 to it.
Humbug: Add 1?
Mathemagician: Now add 1 to that. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 agai-
Milo: But he'd never be able to stop that way.
Mathemagician: Never. For the number you hope for is always at least one more than the one you have.
And that's so large that if you start saying it yesterday, you wouldn't finish 'til tomorrow. 
I hope that's clear to you.
Milo: Nothing's very clear to me.
Here, or in Dictionopolis.
Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Right! It's all the fault of that wretched brother of mine, King Azaz.
(Gently) Ever since the little princesses left, nothing make sense.
(Gruffly) And it's all his fault!
Milo: (clears throat) If you please sir, we'd like to rescue Rhyme and Reason.
Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Rescue Rhyme and Reason?!
(Gently) Rescue Rhyme and Reason?
What a wonderful idea!
(Gruffly) Wait, has Azaz agreed to it?
Tock: Yes sir, he has.
Mathemagician: Then I don't. We've never agreed on anything, and we never will.
Milo: And if I can prove otherwise, can we have permission to go?
Mathemagician: Of course, of course.
Milo: Very well then. Now if Azaz agrees with something, then you disagree, correct?
Mathemagician: Correct.
Milo: And anything Azaz disagrees with, you agree, is that correct?
Mathemagician: (blowing) Correct.
Milo: Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with the other, right?
Mathemagician: Right.
Milo: Then you admit that you do agree with Azaz about something. You agree about disagreeing!
(Surprised Music)
Mathemagician: I've been tricked!
Mathemagician: Again, I want to thank you for showing me how foolish and stupid I've been.
But this gift can supply you with all the numbers, theorems, equations, and mathematical ideas the world has ever known, or ever will know.
Use it well, and there is nothing it can't do for you.
Milo: Thank you!
Mathemagician: Goodbye and good luck.
Milo: Goodbye.
Mathemagician: Goodbye.
Milo: Goodbye!
Milo: Tock, look! 
Is that a demon?
Humbug: Quick, let's go back!
Tock: No, no, no. That's the man I told you about.
That's Chroma the Great.
The one sane man left in this country.
Milo: You mean the one who conducts rainbows, and sunrises and sunsets and things?
Tock: Right. We're lucky. It looks like he's ready to conduct today's sunset. Watch!

Chroma: Why, thank you my boy. 
I've only been practicing since the world began.
Sometime, I'll get it just right.
Milo: I thought it was perfect.
Chroma: You ought to see my lightning, and fireworks!
Chroma: (Yawns) Well, good night my boy.
Oh, don't forget to wake me at 5:23, for the sunrise.
Oh. I really, really must get some sleep.
Tock (loud whisper): Milo, Milo! 
Come on, we're wasting time.
Milo (loud whisper): I can't! I have to wake 
Chroma for the sunrise.
Humbug (loud whisper): Why don't you conduct the sunrise yourself, Milo?
(Humbug Laughs Menacingly to Himself)
Humbug (loud whisper): Save us a lot of time!
And you won't have to disturb Chroma- at all!
Milo: Hey, that's a great idea, I'll do it!
Tock: Why, you fool! What did you tell him to do that for? 
Do you know what trouble he can-
(Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand)
Tock: No, Milo. No!
(Frightening Music Begins)
Tock (slow, warped voice): Oh no.
Tock: Come on, come on! We have to get out of here <br/>before Chroma wakes up.
(Warped Time is a Gift Music Plays)
Milo: Now there's no sense any place. 
And it's all my fault.
Senses Taker: Names? I must have your names before you can proceed.
Milo: Well uh, this is the Humbug.
Senses Taker: Humbug.
Milo: This is Tock.
Senses Taker: Tock.
Milo: And my name is Milo. Now can we go?
Senses Taker: Milo. <br/>Ooh...I haven't had an "M" in ages.
Now then, if you'll just tell me: when you were born; where you were born; why you we born; how old you are; how old you were then; <br/>what grade you're in;
Your shoe size; shirt size; <br/>collar size; hat size; and the names and bank references of six people who can verify this information- then you can go.
Milo: What do you need all this for?
We're in a hurry.
Senses Taker: I'm the official Senses (*Census) Taker. I must have this information before I take your senses.
So now, if you will fill out in triplicate: your height; your weight; how many ice cream cones you eat in a week; how many you don't eat in a week;
Senses Taker: how many you would like-
Milo: We can't waste the time. We've got to get to the
Milo: Castle in the Air! 
Senses Taker: That does it! Now I'm going to take your sense of duty, your sense of precaution,
(Menancing Voice) and especially, your sense of direction.
Tock: Milo! The bottle of laughter! Use this bottle of laughter I got from Dr. Dischord.
He can't take away our sense of humor!

Terrible Trivium: Hello, little boy.
Milo (breathing heavily): Huh?
Terrible Trivium: Welcome to you, your faithful dog, and that handsome gentleman.
I'm so terribly happy to see all of you. <br/>But before you travel on,
I wonder if you could spare me a little time, <br/>and assist me with a few trivial tasks.
Humbug: Why of course!<br/>We're in no hurry.
Tock (whispering): Don't do it, Milo.
Milo: But Tock, we need all the friends we can get up here! Besides, it's only for a little while.
Terrible Trivium: Now young man, if you will take those exquisite tweezers, and move this pile of sand from here to here.
Milo: With these?!
Terrible Trivium: Of course.
And you sir, have the privilege of taking this delicate needle and digging a hole through this cliff.
Humbug: Why, thank you, sir! <br/>An exacting assignment, quite worthy of my talents.
I shall enjoy it to no end.
Tock (whispering): Don't be a fool, bug! <br/>I think this bird is the Terrible Tri-
Terrible Trivium: And you sir, get to take this eyedropper, and empty that well.
Milo: But these tasks don't seem very important.
Terrible Trivium: Of course they're not important.
If you always do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones.
Humbug: Right.
Tock: Now I know who you are, <br/>you're the Terrible Trivium!
Terrible Trivium: Quite correct.
The Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs. Ogre of wasted effort.
Milo: Come on, Humbug! Let's get outta here!

I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly haired, wide-mouthed, bowlegged, big-footed monster.
And if I do say so myself, I'm one of the most dreaded fiends in the whole wide wilderness! Bwhahaha!
Humbug: It sounds like we're doomed.
Milo: "Sounds" is right.<br/>If there's one thing I've learned around here, it's that people aren't always what they say they are.
Insincerity: With awful hideous me here, you wouldn't dare try to escape. Bwhahaha!
Why I'll tear anyone apart that tries to get out of there.
For I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired,<br/>wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, roundbodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster. One false move and I'll...(looks at Milo)

I'll turn ya to hamburger, I'll- I'll,

I don't mean what I say. I don't mean what I do. <br/>I- I'm just mean, I guess.
Now you had to go and spoil everything!
Humbug: Well, if he's typical of the monsters around here, we have nothing to worry about.
Tock: It's the Gelatinous Giant!
Gelatinous Giant (Booming Voice): And what have we here? Aha! I see! Breakfast.
Milo: Wait! I have a better idea.
Gelatinous Giant: An Idea? Ahh. <br/>If there is one thing I can't swallow, it's an idea.
Milo: Well, it just so happens that I have a bag full of all the ideas in the world right here.
Gelatinous Giant: No. No, no, no! Don't open it! 
Leave well enough alone.
Don't take chances. <br/>Keep things as they are.
Changes are so... frightening. No...new...ideas.

Humbug: I think jumping might be safer.
Milo: King Azaz and the Mathemagician said there's nothing I can't do if I use words and numbers right.
And I have a hunch if I use 'em together, <br/>that I can do anything. Now, who's first?
Tock: There's the Hideous Two-Faced Hypocrite.
Milo: Two-Faced Hypocrite. Hmm, let's see.
V for victory over a Two-Faced Hypocrite.
Now, if you take away the two faces, that leaves V/(h).
Forthright. This should be the answer.
All we need is a 4.

Reason: Welcome, Milo, to the Castle in the Air.
Milo: But- but how do you know who I am? <br/>And I mean, are you the princesses?
Reason: Yes, my dear. <br/>This is my sister, the Princess of Sweet Rhyme.
And I am called the Princess of Pure Reason.
Rhyme: And as for knowing who you are, why- we sent for you.
Milo: Se- Sent for me?
Rhyme: Yes. You see Milo, we had to find a boy <br/>who was so bored he would go anywhere and do almost anything to get away from it all. Only such a boy could rescue us.
Reason: But he also had to have courage. And curiosity. 
And kindness. That's why we chose you.
Milo: But you don't know! I've made so many mistakes! <br/>I've messed up the whole sky and I've-
Rhyme: Never feel badly about making mistakes.
Reason: Because often you'll learn more by being wrong for the right reasons-
Rhyme: than you do by being right <br/>for the wrong reasons.
Milo: What about Tock? He's broken! Or dead, or rundown. Or whatever watchdogs do.
We've gotta help him!
Reason: We can help everyone now, Milo.
Milo: You mean now that King Azaz and the Mathemagician have agreed to disagree-
Rhyme: Yes, Milo. Now that you have helped them to understand how foolish they were to disagree at all.
Milo: But how can we get down? 
The stairway is gone!
Rhyme: I think you mean, "whether" we can get down, don't you, Milo?
Because, unless I'm mistaken, <br/>here comes your old friend the Whether Man.
Whether Man: Well now, well now, well now, if it isn't the little boy who got lost trying to find his way.
Expect everything I always say, and the unexpected never happens. Eh, but never mind that.
What you really need now is a "how," isn't it? <br/>And perhaps a- a "here" to go with it.

Oh, and it's also an excellent way of getting from one place to another.

1969 MGM Theme Plays
[Bell Tolling]
- How do you do, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Good afternoon, Your Excellency.
- Very kind of you to receive me.
- Not at all.
- Oh, please. Sit down.
- Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, but we're so busy down here.
Really, sometimes it looks as if the whole world is coming to hell.
Frankly, I haven't had an opportunity to familiarize myself with your case.
When did it happen, Mr. Van Cleve?
Tuesday. To be exact,
I died at 9:36 in the evening.
I trust you didn't suffer much.
Oh, no, no.
Not in the least.
I had finished my dinner—
- A good one, I hope.
- Oh, excellent, excellent.
I ate everything the doctor forbade, and then... well, to make a long story short... shall we say,
I fell asleep without realizing it.
And when I awakened, there were all my relatives speaking in low tones... and saying nothing but the kindest things about me.
Then I knew I was dead.
I presume your funeral was satisfactory.
Well, there was a lot of crying, so...
I believe everybody had a good time.
It would have been an ideal funeral if
Mrs. Cooper-Cooper, a friend of the family... hadn't volunteered to sing
"The End of a Perfect Day."
You see, all my life I had succeeded in
avoiding Mrs. Cooper-Cooper's coloratura... and this undoubtedly was her revenge.
Mr. Van Cleve, I can see that you have a sensitive, cultivated ear.
Oh, thank you.
Then let me warn you.
The music down here is anything but pleasant.
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart — you hear them only... above.
Yes. I know.
It won't be easy not to hear the old masters again.
And there are several people up there I would love to see.
Particularly one.
A very dear one.
- But I haven't a chance.
- Have you tried?
No, Your Excellency.
I have no illusions.
I know the life I lived.
I know where I belong.
I would like to get it over as quickly as possible.
Very well. If you meet our requirements, we'll be only too glad to accommodate you.
Would you be good enough to mention, for instance... some outstanding crime you've committed?
Crime? Crime?
I'm afraid I can't think of any.
But I can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor.
My dear Mr. Van Cleve, a passport to hell is not issued on generalities.
No. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I have time to study your record.
Now look here.
I have to see His Excellency...
and no office boy's
going to stop me.
I beg your pardon, Your Excellency—
- Just a moment.
- I'm Edna Craig.
Oh, yes. I have your record here.
You'll be taken care of in just a moment.
I don't want to seem rude, but I don't think I belong here.
- In just a moment —
- Please don't misunderstand me.
I think it is a charming place.
Isn't it?
Henry Van Cleve.
You know Edna Craig?
I'm sorry, madam.
I seem to be at a loss.
Oh, Henry.
Think back— many, many years.
The little brownstone house around the corner from the old Waldorf?
Oh.
Marmaduke Harrison's party.
We were all dressed as children.
And you came as, uh,
Little Lord Fauntleroy.
And they wheeled you in in a baby carriage.
Little Constantinople.
Oh, Henry.
No girl in New York walked on two more beautiful legs than you.
Little Constantinople.
Well, Henry, I still walk— and on the same two legs.
- [Giggles]
- And I'm sure they're still as beautiful.
Well, Henry, I'll let you be the judge of that.
[Edna Giggling]
[Screams]
Those things are better left to memory.
But I must admit you're beginning to interest me, Mr. Van Cleve.
I think I can spare the time to listen to your story.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Please sit down.
Perhaps the best way to tell you the story of my life... is to tell you about the women in my life.
Well, let's start with the first woman.
My mother.
[Henry Narrating]
A lovely lady, but prejudiced.
She thought I was wonderful.
She was the first woman I ever fooled.
Then there was my grandmother.
She was just as prejudiced
as my mother.
How is the little darling?
Let me hold him.
No. Please, Mother Van Cleve.
Let the baby rest.
- You're just jealous, Bertha.
- I can't stand this any longer.
- I'm going to speak to Randolph about this.
- Yes, Randolph.
First you take my son away, and now you want to alienate my grandchild.
[Henry Narrating] My diapers needed changing,
and already women were fighting for me.
What a way to start a man
on the road oflife.
I was not even two,
and I already got involved in a triangle.
At home, in the presence of my family,
I was the only man in my nurse's life.
I was her honeybunch,
her "oogi-woogi-woo."
But the minute we got to the park—
Hello, Bedelia.
Well, if it isn't Patrick himself.
- [Giggling]
- [Bawling]
Ah, shut up, you nasty little brat.
[Henry Narrating]
No wonder I became a cynic.
My next lesson
came from little Mary.
- Hello, Mary.
- Don't speak to me, Henry Van Cleve.
You're a bad boy, and my mother says
I shouldn't talk to bad boys.
I bet you don't know what I've got in this box.
And I'm not interested,
Henry Van Cleve.
Then I won't tell you it's a beetle.
A beetle?
- Do you like it?
- Oh, who doesn't like beetles?
- It's yours.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Henry.
- I wonder if I should take it.
- If you don't want it —
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I was just wondering.
Don't worry.
I've got another one.
- Another beetle?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It looks rather lonely though.
You know what I think?
I think it wants to be together with mine.
You mean you want this one too?
Henry Van Cleve! Do you think I'm the kind of girl that would take a boy's last beetle?
Aw, that's all right.
You can have it.
Thank you, Henry. Now, if you want to, you can walk with me to the corner.
[Henry Narrating] From that moment on,
one thing was clear to me.
If you want to win a girl,
you have to have lots ofbeetles.
I was growing rapidly,
and so was New York.
Yes. New York was becoming
cosmopolitan...
and no household was considered fashionable
without a French maid.
So, one day a Fifth Avenue coach
stopped in front of our house...
and out of the coach
and into my life came Mademoiselle.
Mrs. Van Cleve will be here shortly.
Merci.
That's Mr. Van Cleve.
Oh, Monsieur.
Charmant, charmant.
This is Mr. Van Cleve's father.
He lives here too.
Grandpapa.
Sweet. Very sweet.
And who is this darling little boy?
That's the young master.
He's not so darling.
- Bad boy?
- Not good.
- Good morning.
- Bonjour, madame.
How do you do, mademoiselle?
- Your name is, uh —
- Yvette Blanchard.
- Yvette Blanchard.
- Oui.
The agency tells me that you've just arrived from France.
- Oui.
- And are seeking employment in this country.
- Oui, madame.
- Uh, you have references?
- Oui, madame.
- May I see them, please?
Naturellement.
- Voilà.
- Thank you.
Oh. [Chuckles]
Uh, they're in French.
Oui, madame. But believe me —
toutes les références— excellentes.
Here, my last employer—
Baroness Lalotte... wishes me to be such grand success in America... that I shall never have desire to return to France.
Ah. The French have such a... continental way of expressing their gratitude.
Um, and here a référence from the duc de Polignac.
He considers the two years
I spent in his house... the two most happy years of his life.
Oh, it sounds just like a duke.
Um, what about your wages?
Uh, maybe in beginning $20 a month would give satisfaction?
Twenty dollars a month!
You see, I've never gone higher than $14 a month for a personal maid.
If I could only justify the difference.
Let me see.
- Oh, Mother?
- Come here, dear.
- Mademoiselle, this is my little boy.
- Bonjour, mon petit.
- Hello.
- He studies French.
Oh, mademoiselle, you must ask him something in French. But not too difficult.
Oui. Avez-vous bien travaillé
aujourd'hui, mon chéri?
Huh?
That's what I was afraid of.
Now be a nice boy and go. I have an idea that I want to discuss with Mademoiselle.
[Laughs] A brilliant child, but a little backward in his French.
- And it just occurred to me that —
- Oh, madame.
It will be pleasure talk only French to little fellow.
My whole vocabulaire
I make present to your baby.
With me in house, in one month I assure
Madame will not recognize own son.
And only for $20.
Of course, that's six dollars more than I ever paid before.
- But let's try it.
- Merci, madame.
- Au revoir, madame.
- Good-bye, mademoiselle.
[Door Opens]
Psst.! Hey.
Oui?
You're not gonna work here.
I'll see to that.
What is the matter?
Did I make little boy angry?
Now see here. That's the last time anybody's gonna call me "little boy."
Oh, so sorry if I hurt feelings, but maman—
Yes. Mama.
That's the trouble.
Mama and Papa.
And Grandpapa and Grandmama.
It's a conspiracy to keep me in short pants.
They think they own me, body and soul.
Ah, je comprends. My understanding for young man is perfect.
Your soul is bigger than your pants.
Oh, you need very warm friend with sympathy.
Moi. I will be. Oui?
I bet you couldn't guess in a million years what I have in my pocket.
No, I do not know, but I am sure it is something very bad, oui?
- Here.
- Oh, you smoke big black cigar?
Sure, I'm gonna smoke it — any day now.
Now we have very bad secret together, oui?
That's nothing.
I can tell you things that would rock
Fifth Avenue to its foundations.
Oh?
- I'm going to get married.
- You, married?
Mmm.
I have to, darn it.
Oh, this is much worse than cigar.
When did disaster take place?
Oh, it all happened pretty suddenly.
There's a girl around the corner.
Well, you know.
But I do not know.
Tell me.
Well, we were walking in the park, and it started to rain.
- Oui?
- We climbed into a policeman's shed.
- And the policeman?
- He wasn't there.
Well, anyhow, before I knew it, I lost my head.
I don't know what got into me.
- I took her into my arms and then —
- And then?
I kissed her.
I may just as well face the consequences.
Excuse my asking question.
This might sound very childish to grown-up young man... but did you ever consider idea not marrying girl?
It's out of the question.
It would destroy me socially.
I could never go to Harvard.
Why, when my father kissed my mother... she knew what he meant, and he knew she knew it.
Écoute, mon chéri.
In your papa's time, papa kiss mama and then marry.
But this is 1887.
Time of bicycle. The typewriter has arrivé.
Soon everybody speak over the telephone.
And people have new idea of value of kiss.
What was bad yesterday is lot of fun today.
There is a wonderful saying in France.
"Les baisers sont comme des bonbons...
qu'on mange parce qu'ils sont bons. "
This mean kiss is like candy.
You eat candy only for the beautiful taste... and this is enough reason to eat candy.
Y-You mean I can kiss a girl once —
Ten times, 20 times.
And no obligation.
Listen, are you telling me the truth or just trying to keep your job?
I'll swear by the extra six dollar
I get from Madame.
Gosh. This is a wonderful age
I'm living in.
Oui. So you do not have to worry about little girl.
Oh, I've forgotten about her already.
I guess I'm pretty blasé.
- Listen, Frenchy.
- What is it, my friend?
If that's the way things are in 1887... what do you think's gonna happen in 1888?
Aha. We make that the subject of our first French lesson.
Au revoir, monsieur.
- Mother.
- Yes, my baby.
That girl is worth the extra six dollars.
[Henry Narrating] The pride
of all the Van Cleves was my cousin Albert.
He was the fulfillment of a parent's dream.
Always the highest in his class.
Never had he thrown a stone into a window.
Nor did he ever put a mouse
in his teacher's bustle.
His ears were always clean.
This, I think, will give you
a rough idea of Albert.
And I'll never forget
the morning of my 15th birthday.
The presents were waiting for me
in the living room.
But suddenly Father came running
down the stairs, excited and breathless.
Flogdell! Flogdell!
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
Tell Robinson to go immediately and get Dr. Macintosh.
- Tell him our little Henry is ill.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, my poor baby.
The boy's acting so strangely, Randolph.
Randolph.
Now, Bertha, Bertha.
We must keep a stiff upper lip.
Randolph, he's talking all the time as if he were in a delirium.
- What does the boy seem to be saying?
- Well, if I only knew, Randolph.
- He's talking French. Nothing but French.
- French?
Oh, Randolph.
Our boy, delirious in a foreign language.
- [Sobbing]
- Now, Bertha, Bertha. This is an emergency.
We must do everything step-by-step.
The next move is to find out what the boy is saying.
Uh — Uh, Flogdell.
- Yes, sir.
- Tell Mademoiselle to come to
Master Henry's room immediately.
Very good, sir.
If only Grandpa would let me rub just a bit of garlic on his little chest.
Stay away from that boy with your garlic.
The boy's sick enough.
[Hiccups]
Randolph, did you hear that?
Did you hear that, Grandpa?
I'm not deaf.
The child's poisoned.
That's what it is.
Oh, Randolph. What shall we do?
Oh, what shall we do?
Now, now. There's only one thing to do, Bertha — keep a stiff upper lip.
But that won't help that poor poisoned boy.
If I had my way,
I know what I'd do.
A big glass of cold water right in that boy's face, and I think he'd start talking English.
- Hugo, you barbarian.
- Oh, no! Please, please!
- You'll give him pneumonia.
- You mustn't do that.
- Please, you mustn't —
- He might —
- [Together] Oh, Mademoiselle.
- Did Madame send for me?
Yes, Mademoiselle.
Our little Henry.
- He's sick?
- Yes, Mademoiselle.
Oh. Excuse, Madame.
I'll be right back.
[Hiccups]
- Oui, Madame?
- Mademoiselle, he's asking for something in French.
- You must help us find out what he wants.
- Oui, Madame.
- Look. He's smiling.
- He's far, far away.
- Why, he seems to be in another world.
- He's looking at Mademoiselle.
- I wonder what he sees.
- Yes. I wonder.
Oh, je suis si malade.
Mon estomac me fait si mal.
- Is he clear?
- Does it make any sense?
Oh, his French is absolutely perfect.
Such beautiful grammar.
Mademoiselle, at the moment we're not concerned with the young man's linguistic accomplishments.
- Don't be harsh.
- I'm sorry if I seem to have lost my temper, but the occasion is a trying one.
- If you could tell us what the child is saying, it might help us to meet the situation.
- [Hiccups]
[Hiccups]
Must be contagious disease.
Son, step out with me a moment.
- Good morning!
- Morning, Albert.
- [Bertha] Shh.! Hush.
- What's going on?
Now, Son, you still don't know what's the matter with that boy?
Father, I wouldn't presume to make a diagnosis.
- After all, I'm not a man of medicine.
- Randolph, how old are you?
What an odd question, Father.
I'm 43.
Well, I think you are definitely old enough to be told the facts of life.
- What are you driving at, Father?
- Now, Son, don't look at me with those big wandering eyes.
It breaks my heart, but I'll have to shatter your childhood illusions.
Randolph, my son, there is no Santy Claus.
And that child of your—
Listen, don't you really know what's the matter with him?
- You get out of here!
- Bertha, what is it?
- Randolph, call the police at once.
- Yes. Call the police.
Quiet! Quiet!
We don't need the police.
Bertha, Mother. I wish someone would take the time to explain to me what this is all about.
Believe me, Monsieur, the excitement is greatly exagéré.
- How dare you speak.
- Have you no shame?
- Oh, please, Grandpapa.
- Don't you call him Grandpapa!
- Don't you dare call him Grandpapa!
- Girls, girls — Shut up!
Go ahead.
Call me Grandpapa.
Merci, Monsieur. Merci beaucoup, Monsieur.
You are very kind.
Yes, I'm very kind, but you'd better go and pack your things now.
And if you're not out of the house in a very little while, I'll come down to your room and help you pack.
I wish you would, Grandpapa.
- Oh, shameless, shameless!
- Leave this house! Go!
There is old French saying: If you are thrown out of house, you better resign.
Au revoir.
[Hiccups]
I still would appreciate it if someone would tell me what all this has to do with our little Henry.
Fortunately, Uncle Randolph,
French always being one of my favorite subjects...
I was able to understand the incredible conversation between Henry and Mademoiselle.
- I, uh, don't know how to begin.
- All right, all right.
Henry had a glass of wine.
We all know that.
Henry? Intoxicated?
From what I overheard, at or about 10:00 last night...
Henry and this — this foreign young woman slipped out of the house.
Before doing this, however, Henry wrongfully took possession of his father's dress clothes... including $20 which Uncle Randolph was negligent enough to leave in his pocket.
Imagine. They went to Delmonico's.
- Did they have a good time?
- They drank champagne.
Our little baby drank champagne.
- Well, thank you, Albert.
- But that's not all, Grandfather.
It seems, from what I could gather, that Mrs. Asterbrook, of the Asterbrooks... who was sitting at an adjoining table... resented bitterly the idea of Henry dropping a nickel into her décolletage... and complaining to the management because no chocolate bar dropped out of Mrs. Asterbrook.
Mrs. Asterbrook?
How can I ever face her?
What a disgrace!
[Randolph]
I'm going to teach that boy a lesson.
Yes, that's what he deserves — throwing nickels around like that.
Knowing the Asterbrooks, I can tell you right now we'll never see that nickel again.
I have reached my decision.
That boy is going to be spanked — and severely.
Oh, Randolph, don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.
- No, no, Randolph.
- Please, please. He's such a baby.
- Well, I assume there will be no further birthday celebration.
- I'm afraid not.
I believe I can utilize this time very beneficially, so I'll say good-bye.
Good-bye, Albert.
You're a real credit to the family.
Thank you, Grandfather.
[Henry Narrating] It was a Sunday morning,
the day of my 26th birthday.
Oh, that boy.
Well, at least poor Grandmother— may her soul rest in peace —was spared seeing a day like this.
Oh, Randolph. Randolph, where can he be?
Where can he be?
Now, now, Bertha.
I'd like to give you some consolation... but all I can say is chins up.
Oh, Randolph, where does he get it from?
I give up, Bertha.
I never gambled in all my life.
I never got entangled with any girl until I met you.
- Randolph, you call it entangled?
- I mean you entangled my heart.
Oh, of course, Randolph.
We entangled each other's heart.
Believe me, Bertha, I never knew what a musical comedy girl looked like.
What can he possibly derive from their company?
To me, they were creatures from another planet.
Where does he get it from?
Nobody in our family was musical.
To this day I wouldn't know how to find the stage entrance to a theater.
It's always around in the back up an alleyway.
There's a sign over the door:
"Stage Entrance." You can't miss it.
But I'm not interested, Father.
I never was.
Where does the boy get it from?
Where does he get it from?
Father built up the Van Cleve
Importing Company from nothing.
When he stopped, I carried on.
Dad, you must admit, from the day I left Harvard,
I earned every dollar I ever spent.
Then why do you give him money without making him work for it?
I have to save the family name. What about you handing him hundreds of dollars?
- If I'd come to you for money, would you have given it to me?
- No.
But you give it to him.
Why? Why? Why?
Because I like him.
Does that mean, by any chance, Father, that you don't like me?
Son, I love you.
Now shut up and leave me alone.
[Door Opens]
Good morning.
- Good morning, Aunt Bertha.
- Good morning, Albert.
- Good morning, Grandfather.
- Morning, Albert.
- Good morning, Uncle Randolph.
- Good morning, Albert.
I just came in to bring a little birthday remembrance for Henry.
Anything wrong?
Isn't he home?
[Chuckles]
If I know my cousin Henry, he's probably still in church.
I mean that humorously.
Albert, I'm struggling successfully against the gout...
I'm waging a terrific battle with my liver, and I'm holding my own against asthma... but I doubt if I have strength enough to survive your jokes.
You're a successful lawyer.
Let it go at that.
I love you, Albert.
Uh, it was sweet of you to drop in, Albert.
I hope he'll be here tonight to thank you.
I hope so too, otherwise I'd be in the most embarrassing position... as far as my future in-laws are concerned.
We're so eager to meet your fiancée.
How does she like New York?
Yes. Is she enjoying herself?
Well, she's only been here two days, so naturally the impression is overwhelming.
I took her to the aquarium. We rode up and down the elevator in the Flatiron Building... and naturally, we ended up in Grant's Tomb.
Naturally.
Uh, and her parents?
Oh, yes. How does the big
Kansas City butcher like New York?
- Now, Father, please.
- I assume that you're referring to... my future father-in-law, who happens to be one of the great meat-packers of our time.
Yes, Father Van Cleve. Don't you realize that every piece of beef we eat... comes from one of
Mr. Strable's many, many plants?
Does that include the steak
I fought 10 rounds with last night?
Grandfather, you don't seem to have any idea of the importance of Mr. Strable.
He created the most famous character in American advertising — Mabel, the cow.
You've seen her, Father, on billboards.
That big, happy cow smiling at you over the fence... and saying in big letters, um, uh —
How does it go?
"To the world my name is Mabel, which you'll find on every label.
I am packed by E.F. Strable, for the pleasure of your table."
No cow in its right mind could have said anything like that.
- Sounds more like Mr. Strable.
- Grandfather, please, I beg of you.
The family understands your humor, but it's a typical kind of New York humor.
- In other words, it's not for yokels, huh?
- [Door Opens]
I beg your pardon, sir. Mr. Henryjust came home.
He went directly upstairs.
[Door Closes]
[Door Closes]
Aunt Bertha, when you see Henry, will you tell him that as a Van Cleve...
I have the right to demand that he keep the shadow of scandal off our name?
You see, my future in-laws are, so to speak, pioneer people, and —
[Hugo]
"Packed by E.F. Strable...
for the pleasure of our table. "
Holy smoke.!
- Good-bye, Aunt Bertha.
- Uh, good-bye, Albert.
[Clears Throat]
- Well, this time I was firm.
- Good, Randolph. What happened?
He asked for a hundred dollars, but I told him.
I told him I'd let him have only 50.
- Randolph —
- And not right away.
For the first time in 27 years of marriage,
I feel like criticizing you.
What do you want me to do?
Spank a 26-year-old boy?
No, but at least I expected a verbal lashing.
- Are you all right, my boy?
- Yes, Mother.
Many happy returns of the day. Ohh.
Mother, I'm sorry if I made you unhappy.
Oh, Grandfather and Father and I are worried to death about you.
You don't give your family a single thought.
All you think about is having what you call a good time.
Mother, I went out last night to raise Cain.
- Son, you mustn't talk like that.
- Don't worry. I didn't.
I couldn't.
I couldn't get her out of my mind.
Son, you worry me.
Are you well?
Mother... when you saw Father for the first time, did you feel that unmistakable something?
Did you feel an electric spark from your head right down to your toes... that swept over you like a hurricane and threw you to the ground... but you bounced up again and floated over the treetops?
Spark? A hurricane?
Heaven forbid.
I never had such a feeling.
Henry, where do you get it from?
Not from me. And certainly your father never had any spark.
Mother, all I'm trying to say is...
I met a girl yesterday.
Oh. I hope she comes from a good family.
I don't know.
And frankly, I don't care.
Mother, when one sees a lovely rose —
One can be certain she comes from a fine rosebush.
Mother, even if this girl's father turned out to be something of a buttercup, I wouldn't care.
What's her name?
Where does she live?
I wish I knew.
She isn't one of those musical comedy girls?
Oh, no, Mother.
It's an entirely different kind of music.
It's not the hootchy-kootchy.
It's not the cancan.
It's like a waltz by Strauss.
Like a minuet by Mozart.
Henry, where do you get it from?
From you, Mother.
Now, you must be just.
When I was a little boy, you wanted me to believe in fairy tales... and now that one has really happened —
You remember that story about the young man —
I think he was a shepherd who was walking in the woods —
Oh, you've been in the country.
No, no, Mother.
It happened right on Broadway.
Suddenly the young man saw a big castle... and leaning out of the window was the most beautiful princess.
Nothing could stop him.
He climbed up the parapet of the castle —
Henry. You haven't broken into the Waldorf again?
Mother, darling, let's forget the fairy tale.
Well, it's about time you grew up.
I came here to scold you, and I'm going to do it.
Now, look at your cousin Albert.
Not much older than you are and already a corporation lawyer... engaged to a lovely girl of a well-known family.
Henry, now, this may sound severe, but you've got to pull yourself together and settle down.
Mother, I don't think I'll ever find this girl, but if I did, then all your troubles would be over.
If she didn't want me to gamble,
I wouldn't look at another card.
I'd stay home every night.
Mother, I might even go to work.
Henry, that's wonderful.
I don't know about the girl... but the fact that you have the desire to settle down makes me so happy.
For the first time you're beginning to sound like your father.
Uh, Mother, I don't know where this girl is, so don't expect too much.
Oh, now listen to your mother.
Don't worry about that girl.
Another girl will come along.
- I'll look for one myself. How's that?
- Fine. Fine, Mother.
And when I find a girl for you, she'll be Miss Right.
And do you know where we'll find her?
In the home of Mr. And Mrs. Right.
Oh, Henry, you're making me so happy.
Mother, I was riding around for hours and hours trying to forget this girl.
Oh, child, don't worry.
Well, it was very expensive.
The cab is still waiting out in front... and the driver was so nice to me that I promised him, if—
I know. Your heart's always bigger than your father's pocketbook.
Look under your pillow.
I put something there last night.
Oh, Mother.
Sometimes I wonder if you're not spoiling me.
[Bertha Giggles]
[Chattering]
- Here, dear.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, this is a great occasion.
You must be proud of your Albert.
- Yes, I think we have a pretty good son.
- Oh.
- I hear the Strable family—
- We couldn't ask anything better for our Albert.
- Oh, wonderful.
- Mr. And Mrs. Strable and Miss Strable.
[Chattering Subsides]
Good evening, Grandfather, Aunt Bertha,
Uncle Randolph, dear, dear family.
It is my privilege and honor to present Mr. And Mrs. E.F. Strable.
And last but not least, well... here she is.
[Crowd Murmuring]
- How do you do, madam?
- How do you do?
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to the pleasure of meeting you.
All my life I've wanted to see the wide-open spaces.
Well, if Muhammad can't go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Muhammad.
You're welcome, Mrs. Strable.
- Yes, we're pretty proud of Kansas.
- Naturally.
And you, Mr. Strable, welcome to our family.
Mr. Van Cleve, we people from the West don't talk much... but when we say something, we mean it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for giving me the chance... to meet the man who feeds the nation.
I hope this will be the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
May you lie as solidly anchored in our hearts as you do in our stomachs.
And, uh, Grandfather, this is Martha.
So, this is Martha, huh?
Well, Martha.
- Yes, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Grandpa.
- Yes, Grandpa.
- If I were about 50 years younger...
I'd take you right away from that s — splendid young man you're going to marry... and who is going to make you a wonderful husband.
Kiss your grandpa.
[Chattering]
- Well, I see the mob has assembled.
- Yes, sir.
- Flogdell, is that —
- That's Mr. Strable.
And that spreading chestnut tree under which Grandfather is standing?
That's Mrs. Strable.
And, uh, where's the lucky girl?
Standing beside your Aunt Minetta with her back to us.
She's just turning round.
Charming young lady, if I may say so.
Flogdell, I don't think
I can stand this party.
- Get my hat and coat.
- But, sir.
My hat and coat.
- Henry! There you are. Many happy returns.
- Thank you.
And now it's about time for you to come and meet the Strables.
- Where are you going?
- Out.
I beg you to stay and behave like a Van Cleve just once.
The Strables know it's your birthday, and they want to congratulate you. Oh, Martha. Martha.
- Yes, Albert?
- Dearest, I want you to meet Henry Van Cleve.
This is the cousin whose birthday we're celebrating today.
Many happy returns, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Cousin Henry.
- Cousin Henry.
- Thank you, Cousin Martha.
- Well, here she is, Henry.
Now I've done my duty bringing some new blood into the family. It'll be your turn next.
- That's most unlikely.
- Oh, nonsense.
All you need to do is to meet the right girl.
That's difficult, Albert.
I'm afraid I'll never have your luck.
Yes. No question about it. I'm lucky.
Well, shall we go in?
Father Strable. Father Strable.
Don't be afraid.
I should have told him.
It would have been the thing to do.
It shall remain our secret.
I promise.
Thank you.
[Henry Narrating]
Yes, we had a secret.
The most innocent secret I ever had.
It happened Saturday morning
in Wannamaker's Department Store.
[Martha]
Hello, Mother? I'm at the hairdresser's.
They're still doing my hair.
Yes. Oh, yes.
Just a moment, and I'll ask them how long it'll be.
[Henry Narrating]
Here was a girl lying to her mother.
Naturally, that girl interested me at once.
They say it'll take about 15 more minutes.
I'll be home at the most in half an hour.
Don't worry, Mother.
Good-bye.
[Henry Narrating]
Why was this angel lying to her mother?
I had to find out,
so I followed her.
But even if she hadn't lied to her mother,
I would have followed her anyway.
- May I help you, miss?
- Thank you.
I would like to see a —
Are there no women clerks?
Unfortunately not.
But it might make you feel a little easier... if I tell you that I'm the one usually chosen by the management to handle... the more delicate situations.
As a matter of fact, they call me
"the bookworms' little mother."
Well, it's, uh —
- Maybe I better come back some other time.
- Please, miss.
My employer is watching, and if he sees me losing a customer, it might cost me my job.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Naturally, I wouldn't like to deprive you of your livelihood.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you again and again.
- Well, the title of the book is, uh —
- Yes?
I saw it in the corner of the second window... between To Have and to Hold and When Knighthood Was in Flower.
Hmm.
There you are.
I probably should apologize.
I imagine I should have called you madam.
No, it's still miss.
- But not for long, I presume.
- That's quite right.
- How much is the book?
- Oh.
We'll be only too glad to charge it if you would be kind enough to give me your name and address.
Thank you, but I'd rather pay.
How much?
- Uh, it's very expensive.
- Oh, that's all right.
Now, this is against the interests of Mr. Brentano... but since I am, so to speak, your literary confessor...
I must be honest with you.
Don't buy this book.
You don't need it.
I'll tell you something much more appropriate for you.
Leave your nest and fly away with me.
Well, I might buy that book too —
Well, we don't have it in stock right now... but I'd love to discuss the idea with you, and if you like it —
I'm afraid I haven't much time.
So, please, will you tell me?
How much is
How to Make Your Husband Happy?
Look at her. Dr. Blossom Franklin.
Now where could a woman like that
have found out how to make a husband happy?
You certainly don't want to learn anything from her.
You're so charming, so young and so beautiful.
I beg your pardon.
You shouldn't say such things.
You see, miss, when selling literature, one gets poetic.
And you must forgive me if I take poetic license once in a while.
I'd rather not discuss it any further, and if you don't mind, I'd like to buy this book.
I do mind. Now, imagine
I'm the man you're going to marry.
I couldn't imagine any such thing.
Well, what's the matter with me?
You think I'm that terrible?
Please. I just came in here to buy a book.
That's all.
I understand. But for the sake of discussion, let's say we are getting married.
Believe me. I don't want anybody to tell you how to make me happy.
The greatest gift you could bring me is to be just as you are — adorable.
- All I want is a book.
- Stubborn, eh?
- What?
- Pardon my poetic license.
If you don't change your attitude,
I shall have to complain to your employer.
I'm not employed here.
I'm not a book salesman.
I took one look at you and followed you into the store.
If you'd walked into a restaurant,
I would have become a waiter.
If you'd walked into a burning building,
I would have become a fireman.
If you'd walked into an elevator,
I would have stopped it between two floors, and we'd have spent the rest of our lives there.
Please forgive me, but you can't walk out of my life like that.
I think your behavior's outrageous.
It's mad.
- I must insist that you leave me at once.
- Never. Never.
Is this man annoying you, miss?
If he is, just say so. I'll take care of him.
Am I annoying you?
Tell the officer.
No. The gentlemen was just saying good-bye.
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
[Henry Narrating]
This was our terrible secret.
##[Woman Singing Aria]
I'm terribly sorry, Albert.
Dearest, you don't seem to realize who's singing.
I know. Young Mrs. Cooper-Cooper.
If it were just a relative, it wouldn't be half so embarrassing.
But Mr. Cooper-Cooper is one of your most important clients. I haven't forgotten.
But what could I do?
I had to sneeze.
But you did it right in the middle of her aria — and five times.
Because I had to sneeze five times.
Albert, suppose someday in the future
I had to sneeze —
Then you sneeze.
Naturally.
Don't you worry. After all,
I'm taking you for better or for worse.
Do you think you may have to sneeze again?
- I don't know. I can't guarantee it.
- Well, then let's not take any chances.
Why don't you go in the library and rest a while and see how things develop?
Make yourself comfortable.
Read a book.
[Whispers]
I think I'd better go back for the encore.
- Yes, dear.
- ##[Aria Continues]
[Gasps]
##[Continues]
[Sneezes]
##[Continues]
- Cousin Henry.
- Yes, Cousin Martha?
You must never do anything like that again.
Is that what you came back here to tell me?
I think it's outrageous.
I hardly know you.
Why, even Albert, my own fiancé, never dared to —
- Kiss you?
- Of course he kissed me. Why not?
After all, we're engaged.
- But he never kissed me like that.
- Like what?
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you.
I don't even know why
I stay in the same room with you.
Please forgive me, but can't we be friends?
- Just friends?
- Never.
Now, look, we're gonna be related, aren't we?
And we're gonna see each other.
- How can we help it?
- I suppose we can't.
And if we meet in the future we don't have to talk about personal things — about you and me.
Let's talk about something neutral.
- For instance, Albert.
- Why not?
By the way, do you love Albert?
I'm marrying him, am I not?
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.
No, you're not. You can't.
You haven't got the book.
- What book?
- How to Make Your Husband Happy.
Well, it might interest you to know that I went back and bought it.
Does it tell you how to make a man happy whom you don't love?
Now, look here, Cousin Henry.
Albert's a fine man.
Yes, he is.
He's good, and — and he has integrity.
- And he's full of high ideals.
- Do you love him?
Well, I'm gonna make him a very fine wife.
At least I'm gonna try my best.
There'll never be a moment in his whole life when he'll ever regret having married me.
And if you ask me one more question, I'm gonna leave this room, and I'll never come back again.
Never!
[Sobbing]
I still can't understand it.
An angel like you and Albert.
It — It doesn't make sense.
- Why do you want to marry him?
- [Sobbing]
Well, you see,
I always wanted to live in New York.
I don't want to say anything against Kansas... but life on my father's estate —
Don't misunderstand me. We have all the modern conveniences and luxuries, but —
Oh, and you don't know
Father and Mother.
Well, I've — I've only just met them.
- Don't you think they're sweet?
- Well, yes. Very sweet.
Yes, they are. But it's not very easy to live with them.
You see, most of the time they don't talk to one another.
And whenever a young man — and there were some very nice ones —
Oh, I'm sure of it.
If one of them asked for my hand and my mother said yes, my father said no.
And when my father said yes, my mother said no.
But Albert came at one of those rare moments when they were both on speaking terms.
And if I hadn't said yes... who knows when my parents might have been talking to each other again?
I might have spent the rest of my life in Kansas.
Don't misunderstand me.
I love Kansas.
It's just that
I don't feel like living there.
Besides that...
I didn't want to be an old maid.
Not in Kansas.
[Sobbing]
Well, you're going to live right here in New York, and you don't have to marry Albert.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do. You're gonna get married, but not to Albert.
And yet you won't even have to change the initials on your linen.
- You're going to marry me.
- Oh, we can't do that.
How can I marry you?
I'm not even engaged to you.
- Martha, do you love me?
- I hardly know you.
You don't need to know anything when you love.
Love needs no introduction.
You love or you don't.
- You don't know what you're saying.
You must be out of your mind.
- Do you love me or don't you?
Trying to take away the fiancée of your own cousin, causing a family scandal.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
Oh.
Oh, why did you ever come into my life?
To make you happy.
To hold you in my arms forever.
I'll never be able to look my father in the face.
- I'll never be able to go back to Kansas again.
- Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, I wish I were dead.
Look, let's get away. Let's get married immediately.
Right away. Tonight.
- You mean elope?
- That's what I mean.
But where would we go? Oh, I never did such a thing before. I feel so helpless.
I haven't got a thing with me.
Oh, I wish I were dead.
When Romeo and Juliet ran away, they didn't stop to say good-bye.
When Leander swam the Hellespont to his beloved, he didn't bother to take a suitcase.
When Tristan falls in love with Isolde, they have to sing for three and a half hours.
All I'm asking you to do is hop into a cab and drive to the first justice of the peace.
What are we waiting for?
##[Mrs. Cooper-Cooper Singing Aria]
[Sneezes]
[Murmuring]
- [All Chattering Excitedly]
- Was that Henry and Martha?
- What happened?
- They left in a cab. They're going to get married.
- Married?
- Married? Married?
Oh, Randolph, where does he get it from?
Now, now, Bertha.
Keep a stiff upper lip.
Sir, I am still too dazed to express myself clearly... but I assure you that the sentiments of our family are with you.
If this happened at home, my husband would jump on a horse and lasso them back.
Don't you tell me what I would do.
But there's one thing I am going to do — disinherit her.
She'll never see another nickel of mine.
- We came here from Kansas a happy family.
- Well, anyway, a family.
- We loved our Martha.
- Don't mention her name again.
And if she comes crawling back to me on her knees... she'll find the door closed — and don't you open it.
Please, dear family... thank you, thank you for your efforts to comfort me in my bereavement... but I feel there are others who need even more consolation than I do.
Uncle Randolph and Aunt Bertha... you will have to forget as the years pass by that you are the parents of the guilty party.
And you, Mr. And Mrs. Strable — well, there's very little
I can say to sustain you.
And to you, Mrs. Cooper-Cooper...
I offer our deepest apology for the unfortunate interruption of your beautiful aria.
I would like to go on, but the strain is too much.
Flogdell.
- Do you know where they were going?
- No, sir.
Flogdell, we've been together for 30 years.
You've never lied to me.
Now tell me.
Do you know where they were going?
- Yes, sir.
- Get your hat and coat.
- Very well, sir.
- Get a cab and tell the driver to go like lightning.
- Very well, sir.
- I think they should have a honeymoon, don't you?
- I think so, sir.
- Then hurry, hurry, hurry!
"She was packed by E.F. Strable...
"to be served at Albert's table... but that Henry changed the label."
That's poetry.
[Henry Narrating]
In the next 10 years old houses were torn down.
New houses rose taller and taller.
New York was changing all over.
But our marriage had lasted
just like our two-story gray-stone house.
[Coughing]
- Good morning, Flogdell.
- Good morning, sir.
- Oh, you're a new man, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
- How long have you been here?
- I should say about a year, sir.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[Clearing Throat]
## [Whistling "Yankee Doodle Dandy"]
- Shh! Jackie.
- Good morning, Daddy.
You know very well you're not supposed to bounce that ball until your mother is up.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- I've told you this many times.
And I'm always sorry, Daddy.
Daddy, I'll bet you'd like to know what I'm gonna give you for your birthday.
- I'm dying to know.
- It's something to wear.
- Let's see now. Uh, is it a tie?
- I'm not telling.
I'll give you a hint.
It has 22 colors in it.
No tie can have that many colors, so it can't be a tie.
It can't be, huh?
Now, I'm not saying it is a tie... but if it were a tie, there wouldn't be another one like it in the world.
- I can believe that, Jackie.
- Daddy, how old are you going to be?
- Thirty-six.
- That's pretty old, isn't it?
Uh —Well, I never thought about it, but I guess it is.
Daddy, when you were as old as me, what kind of a kid were you?
Well, I was very obedient.
When my parents told me to go to bed,
I went without arguing.
I did my schoolwork, brushed my teeth every morning.
Gee, Daddy.
I guess you were a wonderful boy.
Well, I suppose I was.
Then old Grandpa must be a terrible liar.
Well, good-bye, Daddy.
Where does he get it from?
Good morning, Grandfather.
How are you feeling?
[Coughing]
- That's fine. Morning, Mother.
- Good morning, Henry.
Mother, I want you to look at this.
- Do you think Martha will like it?
- Oh, it's beautiful.
After 10 years of me, she's entitled to it.
Yes. Ten years next Tuesday.
- And you'll be 36.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, if your dear father could be here and share this happiness with us.
I always thank heaven he lived long enough to see you settle down, become a fine husband... a good father and a wonderful son.
Well, it's all Martha.
And only Martha.
You know, Mother,
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Yes. She's a fine wife, and she has a good influence on you.
- And she's pretty lucky herself.
- [Clearing Throat]
Yes. Don't be a mother-in-law.
By the way, isn't she coming down to breakfast?
I didn't go into her room. The opera lasted till after midnight, so she's probably tired.
Thank you.
- Anything serious?
- No. No. Nothing.
Uh, excuse me.
I'll be right back.
[Hugo Clearing Throat]
Where is she?
Let me see that telegram.
It's just something personal.
It has nothing to do —
So, you don't trust me anymore, hmm?
I'm getting too old.
Henry... you mean we've lost Martha?
It's impossible.
It's incredible.
It just doesn't make sense,
Martha leaving me.
What did you do?
What happened?
I don't know how I can go on living without her.
Grandpa, I love Martha.
I love her more than anything in the world.
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you what happened.
I don't know.
I always thought she was very happy with me.
I don't know what she's heard.
You know how people talk about anybody.
No man is perfect.
But running away like this —
Believe me.
I — I can't see any reason for it.
If a woman like Martha runs away from her husband, there must be a reason.
Now look here, Henry.
You were the only Van Cleve
I ever really cared about. I loved you.
You were like me — at least I thought so.
You were all the things
I wanted to be.
You did all the things
I wanted to do and didn't.
- And now you've let me down.
- Grandpa, I can't live without her.
- What —What am I gonna do?
- That's up to you.
But let me tell you one thing.
I'm an old man.
I might have to go any day now.
And if you can't make Martha forgive you...
I'll be waiting up there right in the entrance.
And if you ever dare to climb up that ladder...
I'll hit you on the head with a baseball bat.
[Coughing]
Jasper!
- Jasper.
- Jasper!
Jasper.
Jasper.
- Yes, sir?
- Where are the funny papers?
Uh, boss, well, now, you see —
- Get 'em, and get 'em right now!
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning, Mrs. Strable.
- Good morning, Jasper.
Uh, it's terrible bad weather we're having today.
You know, when I see it pouring like this...
I often wonder, where does it all come from?
You tell Mr. Strable he'll get the funny papers when I'm through... and not one second sooner.
Yes, ma'am.
I certainly will.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Boss...
I just had a very fine conversation with the missus... and she says if you'd just be good enough to give the matter a little patience... as soon as she finishes
The Katzenjammer Kids I think—
I came down especially early this morning... to find out if the captain got out of the barrel!
This goes on every Sunday, and I'm not gonna stand it anymore!
- Jasper!
- Excuse me, Mr. Strable.
Yes'm?
You can tell Mr. Strable the captain got out of the barrel.
Boss! Boss!
Got good news for ya!
The captain is out!
Ain't that fine?
- Now you can have a few more cakes.
- Ah, just a couple.
I can't see how he could get out of that barrel.
Why, that barrel had wooden slats... nailed down on the top and the bottom... and there were steel bands all around it... and they left it in the middle of the desert.
Now, how could he ever get out of it?
You eat your cakes while they're nice and hot.
In the meantime,
I'll see what I can find out.
- Uh, another lamb chop, Mrs. Strable?
- I don't mind.
About that barrel, the way he got out of it was, a friendly snake came crawling —
Don't tell me!
You know it's no fun unless I read it myself!
What are you trying to do, ruin my Sunday?
Will you tell Mr. Strable
I was talking to you?
Jasper... the snake came crawling along in the desert... wound itself around the barrel, and then, crunch!
I can't live in this house any longer!
- Mr. Strable.
- What do you want, Daisy?
There's a gentleman here to see you say he's from New York.
- His name is Van Cleve.
- Van Cleve?
That's the gentleman's name, yes, sir.
The nerve of him, trying to walk into this house.
- Tell him to go back where he came from.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wait a minute, Daisy.
- Yes, sir?
Maybe I ought to see Mr. Van Cleve.
And if I wanna see him, he'll come in.
And if I want him to stay here, he'll stay right here!
- Now, Daisy...
- Yes, sir?
Go tell that man if he's not off these premises in 10 seconds, I'll wring his neck!
Yes, sir.
I'll most certainly tell him.
- Jasper, get me some fresh hotcakes.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir, but maybe somethin' done happened to Miss Martha.
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.
- Jasper.
- Yes, ma'am?
Tell that man to come in.
Yes, ma'am.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir!
Mr. Van Cleve, if you please.
How do you do?
Oh! It's the other one!
It's Albert.
Hello, Albert.
- How do you do, Mrs. Strable?
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Strable?
- Well, we haven't seen each other since —
Not since that ill-fated occasion
10 years ago tomorrow.
- Mmm. Had breakfast?
- Yes, thank you.
- Well, sit down anyway.
- Thank you.
- Got some business in Kansas?
- No, I was on my way to California.
But I said to myself, why shouldn't I stop and pay my respects to those charming Strables?
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing. Nothing in particular.
- Good.
- Oh, yes!
There is one bit of news.
I'll bet you can't guess whom I met accidentally on the train.
Probably not.
- How's business in New York?
- Very good.
Well, I don't want to keep you in suspense any longer.
I met your own daughter, Martha.
Don't mention her name in this house!
We don't want to hear anything more about her.
My dear friends... speaking as a jurist, may I say that even in our penal code... we have wisely provided a system of parole... and I have excellent reason to believe that the party— whose name I, naturally, will not mention in this house — has amply paid for her mistake.
Good.
And I am sure there is nothing she'd like better than to come back to the paternal nest.
So she wants to leave him, and now she remembers us.
Not a chance, Albert.
That's final.
Well, she's waiting in a carriage... in front of this very house.
Who?
Martha?
- Martha? Here?
- Yes, Mr. And Mrs. Strable.
Shall I bring her in?
- Well, I don't know what Mrs. Strable thinks.
- Well, I —
- And I don't care.
- I don't care what you think.
- She might just as well come in and stay till after the rain's over.
- All right.
Oh, Martha! Martha!
Hello.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Martha.
- Welcome home, Miss Martha.
- Thank you, Jasper.
- We all missed you.
- Get outta here.
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I assume there are things between daughter and parents... that are better left to the daughter and to the parents.
If you'll excuse me.
Well, I suppose it was a pretty muddy ride from the station in all that rain.
Yes, I suppose it was.
Uh, do you want some breakfast?
It's Sunday morning.
We got wheat cakes.
Thank you, Father, but I'm not hungry.
Well, the place hasn't changed much, has it?
No, it looks exactly the same.
Maybe now you'll appreciate your home.
It took you 10 years to find out that we were right.
- If you'd listened to your mother—
- And your father, things might have been different.
- I think I'd better be going.
- Oh, you're getting touchy, huh?
Well, if anyone has a right to be angry, it's us.
But we're willing to let bygones be bygones.
After all, we're not made of stone.
If a daughter comes home and is sorry—
I'm not sorry, and I don't want your forgiveness.
Then what did you come home for?
I came here because I felt
I wanted to see you.
- If you expect me to get down on my knees —
- Now, now, now, now, forget it.
After all, you were young, and it probably was all the fault of that —
Please, Father.
I don't want to hear a single unpleasant word about the last 10 years, or I'll have to go.
Martha.
You look so tired, dear.
- Well, no wonder. After all —
- Can't you keep still?
It's all dead and buried, and let's forget it.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.
You're going to have a nice, hot bath, and then you're going to lie down and rest.
Now, how's that? Huh?
[Blowing]
So he really got out of that barrel.
Well, what do you think of that?
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Dog Snarling, Barking]
- [Barking Continues]
- Jasper!
Jasper!
What's all that noise about?
Just had a talk with Mr. Chuck.
He say somebody said they saw a couple of prowlers on the grounds.
- Maybe some of them horse thieves.
- Well, tell Chuck to keep after 'em.
- Yes, sir.
- If necessary, shoot 'em.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Father, but if you don't mind,
I think I'll go upstairs.
I'm getting pretty tired.
Good night.
- Good night, Martha.
- Good night, Mother.
Good night, dear.
Remember, breakfast at 7:30.
Yes, Mother.
Good night, Albert.
Good night, Martha.
Martha?
Well, Martha, I want you to have a restful night.
And why not?
Your troubles are actually over.
- I suppose you're right.
- I know I am.
You paid for your mistakes, and paid dearly.
Now, I don't want anybody to get the impression that I've been the victim of 10 years of misery.
Nothing of the kind.
On the contrary, I can say there were moments in my marriage... which few women have been lucky enough to have experienced.
- There were times when you were lifted way up to the sky...
- Yes, way up.
Only to be dropped way down afterward.
That's not the purpose of marriage.
Marriage isn't a series of thrills.
Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people.
I'm afraid that's only too true.
Well, good night, Albert.
Uh, Martha, there's... one other thought
I want you to sleep with.
My feelings for you have remained unchanged.
That's very kind of you, Albert, and I'm touched.
Naturally, I'm not the flashy type, like some people.
I'd say I was rather on the conservative side.
If I were, for instance, a suit of clothes, you wouldn't call me a stylish cut.
And I prefer it that way.
But I can safely say
I'm made of solid material.
I'm sewed together carefully and my lining is good, Martha.
Frankly, I believe I wear well.
I'm... not too hot in the summer... and I give protection in the winter.
- Need I say more?
- No, Albert.
You've given a complete and accurate description of yourself.
- Good night.
- Thank you, Martha.
- Miss Martha?
- Yes?
Excuse me.
That horse thief we were looking for—
- Did you catch him?
- Yes, ma'am.
- He's in your room waiting for you.
- In my r—
- You mean —
- Yes, miss. That's him.
Martha, darling, sweetheart —
How could you do a thing like this to me?
Don't you realize what I went through?
- Oh, Henry—
- Running away like that without a word!
Can't you imagine how I suffered?
How could you do this to me?
Oh, Martha, Martha.
Henry, it won't work anymore.
- What's Albert doing here?
- I met him by accident on the train.
- He was very nice to me, and —
- Accident? You expect me to believe that?
Here I am, looking all over the world for my wife, going insane with despair.
And where do I find her? 2,000 miles away in a lonely country place with another man.
- I don't see how I can stand any more.
- Henry, it won't work.
Very well.
If it comes to the point where a woman doubts her husband's sincerity... there's nothing more to do.
Everything is over.
Good-bye, Martha.
Good-bye, Henry.
Martha, I really mean this.
I'm going.
I know you mean it, Henry.
All right.
Just give me five minutes to pull myself together, and you'll never see me again. Never, never.
Oh, Henry, I know your every move.
I know your outraged indignation.
I know the poor, weeping little boy.
I know the misunderstood, strong, silent man... the wounded lion who's too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night.
So, I'm a fake.
- I'm false, I'm cheap.
- Oh, Henry, please —
- I know I've brought you nothing but unhappiness.
- You know that's not true.
- Oh! So we had some good times together.
- Some wonderful times.
Then what do you want? What did I do?
Even a murderer has a right to defend himself.
- [Together]
You can't hang a man without evidence.
- I know.
[Sighs] If I only knew what particular thing is in your mi —
- Have you seen Aunt Minetta recently?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, well, now everything is clear.
This is something I didn't even want to mention to you, it's so unimportant.
When she saw me, yes,
I was at the Plaza having tea... and at the table with me was a very handsome young woman, but there was nothing to it.
- I would have explained to you myself—
- But you didn't want to make me uncomfortable.
- Even for one second.
- That's right, darling. That's exactly right.
Henry, it won't work. And besides,
Aunt Minetta didn't say one word about you.
- And as for the young lady at the Plaza —
- Darling, I can easily explain that.
Oh, I know you can.
You're a master at that.
All right, all right.
I'm fighting a losing battle.
I don't love you. I never loved you.
I love everybody in New York more than you.
- There you go again.
- [Bell Tolling]
It's the 25th of October.
Many happy returns.
Thank you, Martha... but it's something much more important than my birthday.
It's our anniversary.
Ten years ago today, I was almost as much in love with you as I am right now.
It's very difficult for a woman to send her husband away on their 10th anniversary... especially when he speaks as beautifully as you do.
But I must do it.
All right, darling.
I know it's all over.
I'm sure you'll find someone else who will be... really worthy of you.
But let's pretend... just for a minute.
Happy anniversary.
Do you like it?
I'd say it cost at least $10,000.
For that money, it's a very good purchase.
Why, Martha, how can you talk like that?
If you'd only forgotten to give me this bracelet...
I probably would have been foolish enough to be in your arms right now.
You've no idea what a mistake you made.
The magician played one trick too many.
The other day I was having a new photograph made ofJackie and me.
I wanted to have it the right size to fit into your wallet.
So I slipped into your room.
This fell out of your wallet.
And I don't ever remember having received any bracelet from you on or about May 2.
Oh, so that's what it's all about.
[Laughs]
And to think that you went through all this just because the jeweler made a mistake.
And that what the whole thing is — a mistake.
Naturally, I didn't buy a bracelet for $500.
Has Cartier ever made a mistake in any of our bills before?
Darling, I love you. I think you're the most beautiful, adorable thing in all the world.
Do you really believe there's any woman good enough to take me away from you?
And if there were such a woman, do you think she'd be worth only a $500 bracelet?
- Henry, I —
- Darling, I'll make you a bet.
If Cartier doesn't admit that this whole thing is a terrible mistake —
- Then you won't buy there anymore.
- Henry, it won't work.
- Grandpa!
- Martha, my darling.
Come on, come on.
Let's get started. Let's pack.
- Grandpa, what do you mean?
- Naturally, you're going back with us to New York.
What are you standing there for?
You're making a pretty bad job of it.
Come on, sweep her off her feet, or we'll miss the next train.
- If I can't make her happy, then I don't want her to come back.
- Yeah, that's better.
- No, I mean this seriously.
- That's why it's good.
Look, Martha, let's face it.
- You want a divorce.
- I see no other way.
- What aboutJackie?
- Naturally, I want him.
I think you're right.
I think he should get away from me.
- I didn't mean it that way.
- But I did.
I adore the boy, and therefore
I think he shouldn't be with me.
Well, I don't think a child should be deprived of his father.
Do you want him to grow up to be another Henry Van Cleve... and on his 36th birthday make his wife as unhappy as I've made you?
- Are the rest of your things in the closet?
- Yes.
For instance, do you know what our littleJackie did the other day?
- What?
- He bought some ice cream for a little girl.
What's wrong about that?
I think it's charming.
But the girl he bought the ice cream for was not the girl he should have bought it for.
- It wasn't?
- No.
Little devil.
And when the one little girl found out that the other girl —
Well, that boy got himself into such a mess.
Oh, if I only could have been there.
You should have seen our littleJackie trying to get himself out of that situation.
- Did he?
- Yes.
Little girl likes him better than before.
Good. What a child.
- Believe me, he is a problem.
- I suppose so.
But when he makes up his little stories —
And you know they're just little stories, but he wants you to believe them so badly... that you wish you could... and finally what can you do but —
Happy anniversary.
I'm still too confused.
I've got to collect myself.
- Give her time to make up her mind.
- She can do that on the train.
- But what am I going to say to my parents?
- Send 'em a telegram.
- Sneak out of the house in the middle of the night?
- Exactly.
- Like burglars?
- Like thieves.
- We did it once before.
- Why shouldn't we do it again?
- How many people are lucky enough to have the thrill of eloping twice in one marriage?
- That's it! That's it!
- How many women love their husbands enough to forgive them and start all over again?
- Good! Good!
And how many men love their wives enough to lie and say they're guilty when they've done nothing?
- Careful, Henry, careful.
- At least nothing that amounts to very much.
I wouldn't go any further into that.
We'd better get started.
I'll see if the coast is clear.
- [Whispering] Jasper. Jasper?
- Yes?
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir. Right out in front.
All my life I've wanted to run away with a woman.
- Jasper, it's happening!
- Thank you, sir.
All right, come on.
- [Martha] Bye, Jasper.
- Good-bye, Miss Martha. Good-bye.
[Mr. Strable Snoring]
[Loud Snort, Snoring Continues]
[Murmurs]
Albert!
Come!
And so, farewell, dear E.F. Strable!
We'll take Martha!
You keep Mabel!
Yippee!

Then one birthday began following another...
faster and faster.
Each year there were
more and more candles...
- and less and less—
- [Short Exhale]
Yes, I became 45.
Then came 46...
47...
and I stopped counting.
- ## [Orchestra]
- On one of these birthdays...
Martha and I, just the two of us,
went to the Follies.

- ##[Orchestra Continues]
- Suddenly I noticed...
a very attractive girl
coming down the staircase.
To me she was
just another attractive girl...
but, I must admit, attractive.
Anyway, a few weeks later...
I happened to find out
that her name was Peggy Nash...
and I happened to hear things about her
which made me very eager to meet Miss Nash.
- [Woman] Yes?
- A Mr. Jones to see you.
I'll be out in a minute.
- Will you come in, please, Mr. Jones?
- Thank you.
- Miss Nash will be with you in just a minute.
- Thank you.
- How do you do, Mr. Jones?
- How do you do, Miss Nash?
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Thank you so much for those beautiful, beautiful roses.
When I saw you the other evening at the Follies coming down that stairway, I said to myself—
"That's the girl of my dreams"?
Uh, that's right.
- You see, Miss Nash —
- Call me Peggy.
Well, this is delightful.
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Jonesy.
[Both Chuckling]
Well, Jonesy, let me tell you, that note that came with your flowers —
- You liked it?
- Who wouldn't?
It was so full of charm.
It was so sweet.
It had all the quaintness of bygone days.
[Clears Throat]
Really?
Yes. You know, men don't write that way anymore.
Why are there so few of you left?
[Clears Throat]
Miss Nash, to tell you the truth...
I didn't exactly come up here to be admired as a museum piece.
Now, Jonesy, don't be touchy.
- Yeah. Anyway, Miss Nash —
- Peggy.
Anyway, Peggy...
I'm sure it's a waste of time to talk of the past... when the present can be so lovely that one anticipates a most delightful future.
Oh, thank you, Jonesy.
What a difference.
You know, the moment you meet somebody of today he says...
"How about it, babe?
Where do we have supper?"
The next moment, he pulls out a diamond bracelet.
And before you know it there it is on your wrist.
How crude. How crude.
Yes, very crude.
And let me tell you... a bracelet hastily presented... is usually selected hastily... whereas a bracelet chosen with care —
- Has better stones?
- The very best.
Oh, Jonesy, Jonesy, you make it all sound so wonderful.
- But how could I explain such a gift to —
- To whom?
Oh. Friend of yours?
Very much so.
- Serious?
- I'm afraid it is.
Is there anything I could do to make you forget this young man?
Jonesy, you're asking a lot.
Just look at him.
- He seems very young.
- Not too young.
Would it be indiscreet of me to ask who this young man is?
Come on, Mr. Van Cleve.
Don't you know your own son?
No, I didn't fall into your trap.
You know, Mr. Van Cleve, girls are awfully smart these days.
It must be rather sad for the great cavalier of the gay '90s... to find his technique is getting rusty.
Yes, I've heard all about the daring Henry.
I understand in my mother's day you were.
And I'm sure you had a very dashing figure.
And now you're a kind of, um... retired Casanova.
You know, it's always the same with men when they retire.
Some grow flowers, and, uh... some grow a tummy.
Miss Nash, my son means very much to me.
- He means very much to me too.
- How much?
Oh, yes, that's right.
Of course.
In your day girls used to wait... for the old-fashioned father to come with the big checkbook to pay off.
I'm sure that happened.
Well, that's one thing that hasn't changed.
Shall we say... 5,000?
Five thousand?
Oh, Jonesy, you underestimate me.
I'm much worse than that.
To get rid of somebody as terrible as me is worth —
Well, I'll make you a bargain —
All right.
I'll send you the money.
- Before lunch?
- Before lunch.
Good-bye, Miss Nash.
- You've been perfectly charming.
- And so have you.
- And you hope never to see me again.
- [Chuckles] I wouldn't say that.
Miss Nash, now that our problem has been solved...
I would like to ask one slight question.
Not that it matters, but I'm just curious and I would appreciate an honest answer.
I give you my word.
Suppose you didn't know I was Jack's father and you happened to see me on the street... or in a restaurant.
This is just an academic question.
How old would you say I am?
Well, I'd say about 50.
- That old?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Oh, no, no. That's perfectly all right.
- Thanks very much.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
Fifty.
No wonder you get those headaches.
Thank you, darling.
[Clears Throat]
Martha, this is going to be a bit unpleasant.
I've tried to keep it from you for some time, but now I think I'd better tell you.
I know.
You don't love me anymore.
Now, darling, don't try to be funny.
It's aboutJack.
Will you please stop worrying aboutJack?
If he wants to stay out late, what of it?
If he's ever going to have any fun, now's the time. Don't spoil it.
Martha, this is serious.
Very, very serious.
I just happened to learn the boy got into the clutches of a certain girl.
I went to a great deal of trouble —
Believe me, it wasn't easy— but I managed to find out who the girl was.
- You mean Peggy Nash?
- Ye —
Where did you —
How did you know?
Oh, I forget.
Someone told me.
You go to lunch, and you hear things.
Why didn't you tell me? How can you be so placid about a thing like this?
Darling, why should I excite you?
I know you so well. Certain little things get you all worked up, and then you don't sleep.
Then you have to take a pill, and then you don't want to take a pill.
Believe me, Henry, the less attention you pay to them —
Really, these things work themselves out.
Oh, Martha, Martha.
That is one of your greatest charms.
After almost 25 years in New York, you're still the innocent little girl from Kansas.
But, fortunately,
I have had experience with showgirls.
And it's a father's function to save his son from the mistakes he made.
If we ignore matters like this, how do you think our boy will end up?
Just like you —with a girl like me.
No, darling, never.
Where would he find anybody like you?
He couldn't.
He won't be that lucky.
- Aren't you sweet.
- I have no illusions about myself.
Martha, if I hadn't met you
I hate to think where I'd be right now.
Well, probably outside some stage door... or even inside the dressing room... and having a wonderful time.
- [Chuckles] Oh, now, darling —
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
Don't let's worry about it anymore.
[Clears Throat]
Martha, I just want to get your viewpoint.
Do you think it would be a bad idea, just to be safe, if I looked up this girl and, uh —
And what?
Well, maybe, just to avoid complications... ask her to leave the boy alone and, if necessary, buy her off.
Now, Henry, don't even consider anything as foolish as that.
All right, all right, all right.
It was just a thought.
- If you want me to, I'll drop it.
- Good.
How much did you pay the girl?
Why, what do you mean?
Don't I know my Henry and his innocent eyes?
I beg your pardon, sir, but you've told me to let you know when Mr. Jack arrived, sir.
- He's just come in, sir.
- Thank you.
- [Door Closes]
- Mmm.
You see? He's home early for the first time in weeks, and I'll tell you why.
He went to the theater as usual, and she gave him his walking papers.
- And the poor boy is probably all upset.
- I hope he is.
And, Martha, don't you baby him.
Don't you spoil what I've done.
- Hello.
- [Martha] Hello, Jack.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.
- How are you, Jack?
- Fine.
- You look a little depressed.
- Who, me? I never felt better in all my life.
Besides that, I could use $100.
A hundred dollars?
What for?
Well, I wanna throw a little party tonight, take someone out.
Oh. I see.
Tell me, whom are you going around with these days, Jack?
Now, Martha, that's Jack's personal life and we shouldn't pry into it.
Here you are, Jack.
There's your hundred dollars.
- Thanks, Father.
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.
- I'm not interested in whom you're taking out.
I'm sure she's all right.
Anyway, it's none of our business whether you're taking out MaryJones...
Helen Smith, Mitzi Glutz... or Peggy Nash.
Peggy Nash?
Father, what is this? Are you trailing me?
Where'd you hear that name?
I don't know.
Martha, where did we hear that name?
I don't know.
And don't ask me.
Well, uh, uh, one has friends... and, yes, one goes to lunch an —
Tell me, isn't she a Follies girl famous for coming down a staircase?
- Look, we're all grown up, aren't we?
- Why, certainly.
- Well, I had a crush on her.
- Ah, and why not?
- Why shouldn't he?
- I don't know. And don't ask me.
I, uh — I understand she's a very attractive girl.
Oh, she is, and I took her pretty seriously.
- Oh, you did, huh?
- Yes, very.
- And then after a little time...
- Yes?
- I got tired of her.
- Oh.
Oh, you did, huh?
So then I faced the problem of how to get rid of her.
- Things like that aren't easy.
- I should say not.
- Don't ask me.
- I didn't ask you. I merely made a statement.
- Go on, Jack.
- After all, what could she do to me?
I hadn't promised her anything.
- You hadn't?
- I should say not.
I wasn't the first romance in her life.
You know, I'm no baby.
But nevertheless, you went there expecting a lot of trouble, didn't you?
Yes, but to my surprise, she was so big about the whole thing... and let me off so easily.
Oh, she did, eh?
Well, isn't that fortunate.
- [Chuckling]
- Yes.
She was so wonderful about the whole thing,
I almost fell in love with her again.
Y— Oh.
Oh, but it's all over now, and I'm glad of it.
- And so am I.
- And so am I.
As a matter of fact,
I never was happier in my life.
And while we're on the subject, Jack,
I think you're getting to the age... where you should start to look around for a really nice girl.
Oh, I don't have to look around.
I've met her already.
- You have?
- A wonderful girl.
- The most wonderful girl I ever met in my life.
- Really! Well, isn't that nice.
Tell me, who is the young lady?
Is she someone I might know?
A New York girl, perhaps?
Oh, no.
She comes from Philadelphia.
Oh! From Philadelphia.
Somehow Philadelphia always sounds right, doesn't it, Martha?
- Yes, it does. Tell us who she is.
- Yes, tell us.
Well, have you been to
Earl Carroll's Vanities?
You mean this girl comes down a staircase too?
I should say not.
Not this girl.
This one slides down the bannister, falls in the orchestra... and lands — bang — right on the big drum.
Oh, you'll be crazy about her.
See you tomorrow.
I have to run along.
What's the matter with that boy?
He's young, Henry.
That's all.
Come on, dear.
It's time to go to bed.
Martha, I want to ask you something.
And don't spare my feelings.
Be absolutely frank.
I always am.
If you didn't know me and you saw me for the first time... on the street or in a restaurant —
Martha, do you think
I'm getting a little heavy?
[Laughs]
Don't let that worry you.
As a matter of fact, I like it.
Let me tell you something.
Nearly 15 years ago, when you and Grandfather brought me back from Kansas...
I still didn't feel that you really belonged to me, and only to me.
I can't put my finger on anything definite... but still, whenever I wasn't with you
I was always a little uncertain... and nervous about my little Casanova.
- [Clearing Throat]
- And then... one day I noticed that you began to have a little —
Well, just a little tummy.
Then I knew I was safe.
From that moment on I knew that you were really mine, that you'd settle down.
Now go to bed, darling.
You've had a hard day.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
[Henry Narrating]
Yes, we were married 25 years.
We were celebrating
our silver wedding anniversary.
- Have you seen Mrs. Van Cleve?
- No, sir. I've been in the kitchen.
- Jack, is your mother upstairs?
- No. I haven't seen her.
Darling.
What are you doing in here all alone?
Nothing.
I just want to take a little rest.
- After all, it's been such an exciting evening.
- Nothing wrong, is there?
- No, nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, dear.
- You're feeling all right, aren't you?
- Of course, darling. I'm just —
- Just what?
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was being a little sentimental... so I came in here for a few minutes.
Ah.
Yes.
This is where it all started.
Twenty-five years ago.
I was —
Yes, I was standing over there by that desk.
No, you were sitting in a chair.
Yes. You're right.
And then you came in and you stood by the desk.
Then suddenly you started walking toward me... very slowly, very slowly.
I could count every step.
Oh, you were such a frightened little girl.
The closer I came, the more frightened you were.
Darling, I want to make a confession.
- After all, we've been married 25 years.
- What is it?
I wasn't frightened at all.
- You weren't?
- Not at all.
And when you were walking toward me so very slowly, do you know what was in my mind?
- No.
- I thought, What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?
[Both Laughing]
- And then I ran out into the hall.
- But you came back.
- Only because I had to sneeze.
- Mm-hmm.
[Laughs]
I beg your pardon, madam.
You are wanted on the telephone.
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, I called you.
Well, it's really not important.
Yes, everything is all right now.
I'll call you soon.
All right, tomorrow.
- Who was that?
- Oh, nothing special.
- Let's go back to our guests, shall we?
- Darling, who was that on the phone?
- I'll tell you all about it some other time.
- Why not now?
- Our guests will be wondering where we are.
- Now, Martha, who was that?
All right, I'll tell you.
It's another confession.
- My lover.
- I don't think that's funny at all.
- Are you jealous?
- Oh, don't be silly, Martha.
But why can't you tell your husband whom you talk to over the telephone?
Besides, I wouldn't have brought it up right now, but just the same... for the past several weeks you've been going out in the afternoons... and you've always managed to avoid telling me where you were.
You are jealous!
Henry, at last, after 25 years!
- Thank you, darling.
- Martha, whom did you talk to?
Darling, don't be a baby. What dashing young cavalier would be pursuing me?
Plenty. You're still very attractive, and — and you know it.
Henry...
I don't think you realize how sweet you're being at this moment.
No husband could have said anything lovelier to his wife on their 25th anniversary.
Imagine if, 25 years ago,
I hadn't sneezed.
I wouldn't be the happiest woman in the world right now.
- Are you?
- Yes, Henry.
- Now, who was it?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
I am not going to leave this room until you tell me.
Well, knowing my obstinate little boy—
You promise to be sensible and not make a mountain out of a molehill?
- I promise. Now —
- Well, you know how women are.
We have too much time on our hands, and we begin to imagine there are things wrong with us.
And I'm no exception, so I've been going to a doctor, that's all.
[Laughing]
Darling, I feel like a fool.
Now I have a confession I must make to you —
I really was jealous.
Martha. What did you go to the doctor for?
What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.
- So that's why you came in this room.
- You weren't feeling well. Darling, is it serious?
- I tell you, it's nothing at all.
- Just a little dizzy spell.
- Darling —
Now, you promised to be sensible.
Come on, let's dance.
Martha, what did the doctor say?
Listen, dear, if I take five drops three times a day... and if you don't worry about me too much... we'll both live to celebrate our golden anniversary.
- Now, come on. Let's dance.
- ##[Continues]
[Henry Narrating]
I didn't know it then...
but this was our last anniversary.
It was the last time we danced together.
There were only a few more months
left for Martha...
and she made them the happiest
of our lives together.
Sixty. Yes, I was 60.
Jack insisted on celebrating.
And here are my relatives
who came to make this birthday...
an occasion of riotous gaiety.
Cousin William— 73.
Aunt Minnie,
who admitted to 81.
The total age
of this scintillating assemblage...
was over 1,400 years.
I believeJack gave this party
on purpose...
to remind me that I was contributing
60 years to that 1,400.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.
- Is Mr. Van Cleve down yet?
- He's having his breakfast.
Oh. Thank you.
- Good morning, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.
Sorry to get you up so early, but I want these two letters to leave on the 9:30 plane.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
When you get back to the office, please see that I get a complete domestic report... from every department before noon because I may go to Chicago.
Very well.
Now, uh, there's just one little thing.
It's, uh —Well, a letter came in from your father addressed to the board of directors, and —
Is he trying to go over my head again?
- Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean it that way.
- What does he want?
We live together in the same house, and then he writes letters to the board of directors.
What's the old gentleman trying to put over this time?
He wants the board of directors to vote him a bonus.
- A bonus?
- He talked to me yesterday, confidentially.
In case that bonus doesn't go through... he wanted me to persuade you to give him at least an advance on his monthly check.
He shouldn't go to you, Miss Ralston.
Well, I'm gonna give him a lesson.
And, Miss Ralston, if my father
ever talks to you again...
tell him he ought to be ashamed and that
you are in no position to deliver any messages.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.
- Why, Mr. Van Cleve —
- Shh!
- Is he in a bad mood?
- Terrible.
Now, look here, Miss Ralston, would you do me a very great favor?
- Father.!
- Ohh.
- Good morning, Jack.
- Good morning.
I'd like to talk to you.
Father.
[Henry Laughing]
I heard a very funny story. You'll love it.
It'll start your day off with a laugh.
[Chuckles]
You ought to be ashamed, coming home at all hours, making a wreck of yourself.
How much longer do you think you can keep this up?
- Please, Jack, don't scold me.
- Someday you're gonna collapse.
- Do I look that bad?
- You look like a ghost.
I know you're right, Jack.
I know I should change my way of living.
But, my boy, put yourself in my position.
I'm lonesome.
You're always away somewhere on business.
Being alone in this big house night after night, you don't know what it's like.
Neither do you because you're never at home.
But I can imagine what it's like, and, Jack, it's horrible.
Now, my boy, I want to talk to you.
I'm not fooling myself.
I'm not getting any younger.
I think the time has come for me to change my way of living.
You know, Jack, when a man gets to be — gets to be 60... the blood doesn't flow as fast anymore.
Instead of a wild mountain stream, it becomes a quiet little brook.
The other day, when I was sitting here all alone, you know what I felt like doing?
- What?
- I felt like I wanted to sit... in a nice, comfortable chair... and read and read and read.
Well, why didn't you? The library is full of books, and I'm sure you haven't read one of them.
Jack, the eyes can't take it anymore.
Why don't you go to an oculist?
Uh, yes... that might do.
Yes, that might do.
But, uh... on the other hand... what do you think of the idea of having, well, some kind of reader?
You know, someone with a pleasant voice, nice diction.
I know just what you want. You mean one of those nice, quiet fellows from Yale or Harvard.
Oh, they're easy to get.
- Now, who is she?
- Jack, you have the most suspicious mind.
Come on.
How old is she?
Well, uh, she's an unusually adult young woman.
I met her at old Wilson Weatherby's.
She was his reader.
Hmm. The whole thing sounds a little fishy to me.
Now, Jack, why do you want to deprive your old father of a little cultural pleasure?
I can think of nothing more dignified and homelike... than sitting in front of a fireplace and having someone read a fine book to me.
Something worthwhile.
Something —
Father, her last thought was that you should be happy.
I promised her I'd see to it.
So, if you want this young lady to read to you, go ahead with my blessing.
No, I couldn't do it.
When a man gets to be 60, his life —
Isn't over, Father.
Doesn't have to be over.
If a man is lonely and he feels that he needs, well —
You mean, the feminine touch?
That's natural.
But I think he should find someone closer to his own age.
Maybe.
Not a girl of, uh —
Twenty-four.
Well, that is a little out of proportion.
I'm afraid so.
But if, on the other hand, he should meet a cultured woman of—
Right.
Someone with real dignity?
A woman of about 50 or 51.
Or 52 or 53, or even 55.
That's more like it.
Jack, my future looks pretty depressing.
Mr. Van Cleve, you're wanted on the telephone, sir.
Hello.
What?
Oh, uh, just a moment.
It's for you, "poochie."
[Henry Narrating] As a man grows older,
his medicine cabinet grows bigger.
This is me at 70.
Now, really, there's nothing to worry about.
But, Mrs. Van Cleve, please —
I know, but it was his 70th birthday yesterday... and I didn't have the heart to keep him from celebrating a little.
I hate to go to that banquet and leave the old man alone.
- I'd just as soon stay home.
- No, it's perfectly all right for you to go.
In fact, the fewer people around him, the better off he'll be.
Now, Mr. Van Cleve, I'm sorry to wake you up, but it has to be done.
[Muttering]
Oh, if I could just —
[Continues Muttering]
[Groans]
- Now, open your mouth, please.
- Oh, go away. Go away and leave me alone.
[Groaning]
What was that dream all about?
Oh, I was having such a good time.
- Just open your mouth.
- What was that all about?
Oh, yes.
The door opened and a man stepped out of a rowboat.
He said, "Henry...
I've come to take you on a trip from which you'll never come back."
Now, please, don't get excited.
And I said, "My good fellow...
"if I ever take a trip like that, it'll be in a deluxe cabin... and not in a dinky little rowboat that doesn't even have a bar."
So I threw him out, rowboat and all.
Good. Good.
And what do you think he did?
He came back with a big luxury liner... floating on an ocean of whiskey and soda.
And instead of funnels... there were big, black cigars.
And on top of the bar, sitting in a lifeboat... was the most beautiful blonde... wearing a Merry Widow costume.
She dived into the whiskey and swam right over to my bedside.
"Henry," she said...
"how about a little dance?"
And the man from the boat took an accordion out of his pocket... and he played...
"The Merry Widow Waltz."
The girl held her arms out to me... and she started to dance.
Well... with him playing and her dancing... and me up to my neck in whiskey anyhow... well, I put my arms around that beautiful girl... and was just about to dance with her... when, of all people, you cut in.
You. Yes, you.
- Just open your mouth.
- Go away, and take that thermometer with you.
[Moans]
[Knocking]
- The night nurse has just arrived.
- All right.
- [Nurse] Good evening.
- [Night Nurse] Hello.
- First door to the right.
- Thank you.
[Henry Sighs]
I'd fallen asleep... and suddenly I was awakened by a caressing touch on my forehead.
I opened my eyes and there she was, sitting right on the edge of the bed.
Nellie Brown, Registered Nurse.
Your Excellency... one look at her and it didn't matter whether she was registered or not.
Then she took out a thermometer... and she said, "Open your mouth."
Who wouldn't for Nellie?
And then she put the thermometer in... and my temperature went up to 110.
Who could ask for a more beautiful death?
[Sighs]
Your Excellency, that's the story of my life... and I'd be grateful if you'd push the button and have it over with.
No.
Definitely no.
I hope you will not consider me inhospitable if I say... sorry, Mr. Van Cleve, but we don't cater to your class of people here.
Please make your reservation somewhere else.
Somewhere else?
But, Your Excellency, if I walk into the lobby of the other place —
You mean, above?
Yes.
I know what will happen.
They might not even let me register.
The doorman might not even let me in.
Well, you never can tell.
It's worth trying.
Sometimes they have a small room vacant in the annex.
Not exactly on the sunny side... and not so very comfortable.
The bed may be hard... and you might have to wait a few hundred years until they move you into the main building.
Well, it doesn't hurt to try.
After all, they may inquire about you among the residents in the main building.
I think you'll find a lot of people who will give you a good reference, and that always helps.
For instance, there were... several young ladies.
- What about them?
- Well, some of them might be there.
And so far as I can see, you've made them all very happy.
Oh.
I'm sure they'd like to see you happy too.
And your grandfather.
Oh, yes. Grandfather.
Don't you think he'll be waiting for you?
- He might.
- He will.
- And not with a baseball bat.
- Hmm.
And if they all should fail, there's still someone else.
Yes.
She's up there.
And she will plead for you.
Do you think so?
You know she will.
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve...
I would say you have a chance — a very good chance.
Anyway, it's worth trying.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Your Excellency.
- And thank you.
- Good luck.
I'll need it.
Down?
No.
Up.
Suzy Bannion decided to perfect her ballet studies...
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,
And arrived in Germany at
Taxi!
Taxi, taxi!
Taxi! Hey, taxi!
Taxi! Taxi!
Can you give me a hand?
Uh, Escherstrausse.
- Was?
- Escherstrausse.
Was?
Ah, Escherstrausse.
Ja, ja.
Has it been raining this hard for long?
Half an hour.
Can you wait a minute, please?
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.
- I don't know you. Go away!
- But I have the letter you sent.
Look, it's really raining hard. You could just let me in and I'll explain.
- Go away. Go away!
- But you don't understand!
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.
Hello. Is anybody there?
Hello?
If you're happy enough with the couch, you can stay for as long as you please.
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.
- I'm going away forever.
- Oh, big deal, kid.
So what if you've been thrown out of school?
I always got kicked out of school, beginning in kindergarten.
No, that's not it. I don't give a damn about getting kicked out.
Well, then?
It's useless to try and explain it to you.
You wouldn't understand.
It all seems so... Absurd,
So fantastic.
All I can do is get away from here as soon as possible.
Would you mind if I used the bathroom? I'd like to dry off.
No, of course not. Go ahead.
Hey, why don't you close it?
That's better. It was just the wind.
You sure are in bad shape.
You have to tell me all about it.
The wind! The windows burst open.
- I got scared.
- No. That's not it.
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.
Okay, you can tell me about it later.
Let me in! Pat!
Pat! Pat!
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!
Help me! Help!
No! No! No!
Help me!
Help!
There's a murderer!
No!
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.
Good morning, miss Tanner.
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that...
Right. I did arrive last night about 10:00.
But the door was locked, and somebody on the call box...
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.
- Who said that to you?
- I don't know. She didn't say her name.
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.
Nice to meet you.
Come along. I'd like to introduce you to madame Blanc,
Our vice directress.
She was a very famous ballerina.
- Madame Blanc?
- Yes?
Suzy Bannion, our new student.
Oh, yes.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Of course, madame.
You're pretty. Very pretty indeed. They're policemen.
I knew a woman called Bannion years ago in New York. Carol Bannion.
- She's my aunt.
- Good! She's a marvelous woman,
A friend and benefactress of artists everywhere.
I'm delighted to have her niece here.
Well, I offer our academy's official welcome in the name of our directress,
Who unfortunately is not here at the moment.
- She's traveling abroad.
- Thank you.
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.
I must tell you what I have to say very quickly...
Because those gentlemen are waiting for me.
Something terrible, truly horrible, has happened.
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,
Was murdered last night by some madman. It's a frightening story.
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?
I tell them to be careful, not to get involved with questionable friendships.
What I wanted to tell you was that your room here isn't free yet.
- Just a slight hitch.
- Yes, but don't worry.
We've found you a place to stay with one of our third-year students who lives in town.
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,
But it's a good price, and you can deduct it from your fee here.
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner, one of our veteran teachers here.
Don't be upset if she seems a little stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.
She really is an invaluable teacher.
- Come with me.
- And now, gentlemen...
As you know, our courses last three years,
And you must pass an exam at the end of each year.
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?
- That's my information.
- Excuse me.
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.
She's a new student. She just arrived. What did she look like?
Well, she had blonde hair and was wearing a brown raincoat.
- What did she do?
- I don't know. I only saw her for a minute in a storm.
So you see? It really was 11:00.
Coming?
We don't teach you how to dance here, because we presume our students already know how.
This is an established academy dedicated to specializing.
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.
He's really ugly, isn't he?
Don't be afraid to say so.
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very handsome ever since he got those false teeth.
Last year, he discovered He had gingivitis of the gums,
So he had all his teeth pulled.
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.
Bang.
- Where are we going?
- To the locker room.
We also have a swimming pool, which you can use when you want.
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.
- Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
- Who said that? Shut up.
That's enough of these little games for the moment.
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.
You'll find several fellow Americans among these girls... Miriam, for one.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Your locker's over there.
You'll find everything in there except shoes.
For today, you can borrow shoes from someone who has two pairs.
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting for all of you in the red room.
Come with me.
Mata Hari is going to file her report.
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.
- Yeah.
- In advance.
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not... Oh...
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?
- Yes. Me.
- Oh, thank you.
If you want to buy them, I can make you a nice price. Fifteen marks.
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.
I just need a pair for today.
But if you'd rather not...
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.
- But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
- Of course.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.
Did they shake you up with all that talk about money?
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.
Same with me at first.
Then I found out it's a charming habit around here.
I once read that names...
Which begin With the letter "S"...
Are the names of snakes.
Next year, after I finish the course,
I've got an offer from the state school of ballet in Geneva.
What about you?
Well, I'll go back to yhe states, but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.
- Like it?
- Uh-huh.
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do nicely together. I think you're sweet.
Even if I have the name of a snake?
I was just kidding.
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.
No.
Hello?
Oh, hi! No, no, no.
You did the right thing.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.
I thought you might be needing them.
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.
- Anyway, thanks a lot.
- Oh, no. It's nothing.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Don't you want to stay for a while?
- No, thanks. I can't.
I live at the school, so I've got to be back for supper in half an hour.
- I have to.
- Just for a minute?
No, no, really. I have to be going.
They get very upset if you show up late for supper.
- Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
- Well, ciao.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
No, go on.
Uh-huh, I know.
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can hear you very well.
Didn't you see how he was blushing?
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um...
And he never has enough money for room and board at school.
That's why that bitch Tanner has got him under her thumb.
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.
Sure.
I got it. Okay.
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.
Anyway, he is cute.
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.
That poor kid, ending up like that.
I can't even think about it.
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.
Uh-huh. Outside the school.
She was acting very strange.
Mumbling to herself.
She really felt terrible when they kicked her out, but she really deserved it.
- There was so much noise.
- God, was she difficult.
She was saying things that made no sense.
She was always arguing, causing trouble.
"Secret."
"Iris."
What?
Uh, I remember...
She mentioned the word "secret."
And then she... Mentioned a flower...
Iris, I think, or a lilac.
Secret flowers? What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. She was a busybody.
It would've been easy for her to find out one of us was in a jam.
- How do you like it at Olga's?
- It's nice.
Those eight on the list this morning, come with me to the yellow room.
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- I've got good news for you.
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.
Isn't that marvelous? You can move in today, if you like.
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,
But in your letter of enrollment, you said you'd be boarding at the school.
- I know, but...
- The room is free now.
- Well, I didn't think it was so important.
- As you wish.
If that's what you want, so be it.
Sara?
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.
I see that when you make up your mind about something,
Nothing will change it for you.
My compliments.
Witch!
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,
The technique of classical ballet...
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.
All right. Let's warm up.
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.
And now some exercises.
Daniel, you may begin.
One, two, three and four.
And one and two...
And three and four.
And one and two...
And three and four.
- And one...
- I'm sorry, miss Tanner.
I feel a little weak. Can I just rest for a second?
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.
This is the first time we've worked together.
I want to see what you can do, how far along you are.
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.
Daniel?
All together now.
And one and two...
And three and four.
- I can't. Please.
- And one and two...
And three and four.
And one and two and three and four.
And one and two and three and four.
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs up higher. You're not paralyzed.
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and...
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...
And three and four.
And one and two and three and four.
Come on. Come on. Run along.
Come on. Drink up.
- Oh, you... You must drink.
- No, that's enough.
You heard what the doctor said.
- Drink up.
- No.
You must drink.
The blood that was hemorrhaging is going back with the intake of liquids.
- Right, professor Verdegast?
- Obviously.
My dear madame.
Do not be concerned. It's nothing, as I've already told the young lady.
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?
- Uh, better.
- The fault lies with your exercises.
When somebody's been out of practice, violent movement could cause tiny tears in internal ligaments.
Thus the hemorrhaging.
You look better already. You've even got color back in your cheeks.
- Isn't that right?
- Oh, yes. She looks much better.
- Ow!
- Hold still.
This will get you back into shape in no time.
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two, you'll be on your feet, as good as new.
- Who brought my bags here?
- Olga. What a dear.
The minute she heard you were ill, she went right home and brought your things.
Oh, and she also left me your $50, and she didn't take a penny of it.
Why... Why did she do that?
- If I wanted to, I would...
- Well, my dear,
What you need now is some peace and quiet.
If the hemorrhaging should start again, which is very improbable,
You can telephone me.
And Tanner, she is to eat bland food for about a week.
And you mustn't let her have any fruit.
- A drop of vin rose?
- Yes.
Good. A glass of red wine with each meal. It works miracles.
Clears up anemia and strengthens red corpuscles. It builds the blood.
Rest well. You're in good hands.
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.
So, you moved in here.
Well, they moved me in here.
I really didn't want to.
You know, as soon as I got sick, your pal Olga ran and got my bags...
And threw me out of her place.
She must've thought I had something awfully contagious.
But I can't stand to live in a boarding school like a ten-year-old.
Oh, wow. You come back strong.
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.
I mean, it's almost as if nothing had happened. It's incredible.
- And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
- Verdegast?
- He came to look at you?
- Yeah.
Come in.
Hi, Pavlos.
Thank you.
You'd better keep an eye on that lighter. He really likes it.
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.
At least you know.
- Are you eating up here?
- Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.
The bell. Oh, god. That means it's only 15 minutes till supper.
I'd better change.
- Ciao. See you later.
- Okay.
Where? Where?
Everywhere. The whole floor.
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!
- Where are they coming from?
- I don't know! Let's go and see!
- They're coming from the ceiling.
- In the meantime, everybody downstairs.
Don't let anyone come up.
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.
But it was nothing to do with you, madame.
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.
We ordered those cases of food by mail...
From a reliable firm that we thought to be honest.
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.
In a few days' time, you see what happened.
- Oh, it was awful.
- Yes, one got in my mouth.
I suppose we're fortunate those things only reached the floor below the attic.
- Are the other floors all right?
- Yes. We checked them out.
Just the floor where the students' rooms are.
Well, I'll take care of the problem of fumigating in the morning.
In the meantime, for tonight, I've thought of a makeshift arrangement.
Go and see how they're getting along, will you, dear?
The boys have kindly offered to help,
And they and the servants are turning the practice hall into a dormitory.
If some of you choose to find hotel rooms, I'll have no objections.
But it's already late, and in any case,
The inconvenience will only be for one night.
We'll all sleep together.
- Bravo.
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.
- Are you all right?
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.
- Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
- Good.
Are you sleeping here with us, too, Madame Blanc?
Certainly, as are all the other teachers and miss Tanner.
Do the teachers live here at school?
No, they live in town.
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.
It's very late. You won't be afraid if I turn out the lights?
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night. Good night.
Is that guy hot for you?
- Maybe.
- That's funny.
I heard he was, uh...
- Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
- That's a good one.
Come on. You tried to get him and didn't make it.
- You liar! That's not...
- Why don't you two shut up?
Some of us want to go to sleep.
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.
Suzy, are you asleep?
- Were you sleeping?
- No. What's the matter?
You hear that snoring?
It's weird.
Hear it?
Where do you think it's coming from?
Behind the sheet.
Lies!
What?
They lied to us.
The directress is here.
That's her, the one who's snoring.
She's the directress.
- How do you know?
- I'm sure it's her.
Last year, for a while,
I lived in one of the guest rooms...
Under the top of the stairs.
One night,
I heard someone coming very late in,
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.
And then...
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.
Listen.
You hear that whistle?
It's exactly the same.
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...
That the directress had spent a few hours at the school...
And had slept in the room next to mine.
You see?
So I know she's the directress.
She's here.
She's there.
Right behind that sheet.
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take care of the fumigating so promptly.
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- Good morning, Daniel.
- Is everything in order now?
- All cleaned up, madame.
Just to be sure, we checked the other floors too.
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.
Did the directress sleep here last night?
- No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
- Good morning.
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which class do I attend this morning?
The second-year class in the red room.
Thank you.
Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Enough. Enough!
- Do you know what happened? Do you know?
- What day is it?
Your lousy, disgusting dog has bitten Albert!
He took a piece out of Albert's arm.
- What?
- Did you all hear that?
That miserable dog tried to mutilate a child.
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to a first-aid center to have stitches put in!
- That's impossible.
- Let's go to the first-aid center.
Even if you can't see the blood, at least you can hear the poor child's crying.
That's enough now!
My dog's a peaceful, faithful animal. He's never hurt anyone.
The boy must have done something to him first!
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!
If I ever see him within a mile of this school again, I'll have him put to death!
Stop it!
I won't allow such talk, you understand?
You won't allow it?
Then get out! You and your dog!
- Get moving!
- You bitch!
Out!
I'm going. I'm going.
But try to understand that...
That I'm blind, not deaf.
Get it? Huh?
Not deaf.
Not deaf. You understand that?
You understand?
Ahh, fresh air!
Let me out of this gilded parade.
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer do I have to eat like this?
Hey, listen.
There they go, right on schedule.
The teachers. Remember?
Can you hear them?
They're going away.
You hear them?
Yes.
I... l... I don't think they'll even miss school.
What? What did you say?
Wake up.
I said, it doesn't seem to me that they're going out.
A front door is on the left.
Their footsteps are going to the right, somewhere inside the school.
Jesus, Suzy.
- You're a genius.
- Mmm.
Fantastic.
How come I never noticed that before?
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?
Wake up. Suzy.
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!
I'm so sleepy.
I don't know why. I'm sorry.
Maybe...
Maybe we can find out where they really go.
Of course!
Yes.
Begin to count the steps as they go.
It's like the search of alietne.
Easy.
What is it? Huh?
Come on.
Come on; let's go home.
Who is that? Who's there?
Easy, boy.
What is it?
What's happening?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Wait!
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.
Oh, yeah, but you can never put too much trust in wolfhounds.
They're crazy. We had two of them once at the villa in Gestaad.
My god. First Pat gets murdered by a madman,
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist and have it purged.
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- No, everything's all right.
Is it something personal, dear?
No, no, it's nothing like that.
Miss Tanner, would you mind?
I'd like a few minutes alone with Suzy.
Well? What is it?
I just wanted to talk to you about some of the things that have been happening lately.
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's death, as we all have been.
No, but it's more than that.
Does anybody know anything about who killed Pat?
I spoke with the chief of police just this morning.
He told me they had some definite clues.
- You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
- Yes, you told me that.
And that she was mumbling some strange, unrelated words.
No, you didn't tell me that.
Because it was something that didn't make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.
I just didn't pay much attention to it.
I only caught two words distinctly:
"Secret" and "Irises."
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.
You've done very well. Congratulations.
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.
But I think it's only right we should let the police know about it.
I'm only amazed you waited two days before... hello?
- You really messed things up.
- What are you talking about?
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...
Someone just inside the building that night.
And we know that someone wasn't one of the teachers.
Come on.
Now you've put them on the hunt for somebody.
What difference does that make to you?
Big difference.
Because I was Pat's friend.
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.
She got scared and she ran away.
She was in hysterics almost.
And then she was killed.
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?
Well, that was me.
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.
Pat was taking notes on them for months.
And before going away, she gave me all the notes.
I've only told one person, a very good friend of mine.
Frank Mandel. He's here for a convention.
I'll let you read them tonight.
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.
The notes are gone! Someone stole them from me!
You understand? They disappeared.
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!
- Wake up! Help me!
- I can't.
Can't?
This is the only thing I got left, and that's because I kept it on me. Look.
- Look.
- What is it?
What's the matter with you? Don't you remember? What's going on?
This is the key that'll get us wherever the teachers go every night.
I thought it out yesterday evening while I was sitting here next to you.
Suzy, do you know anything about witches?
Oh, no! Please!
Don't leave me alone!
I must get away!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.
But that's impossible. I just talked to her last night.
She left this morning, as a matter of fact, without telling anyone.
Just packed her bags and left. She was heard leaving about 6:00.
- You heard her leave, didn't you?
- Sara? Oh, yes.
I heard the door close and her footsteps going down the hall.
And then I heard a car driving off down the street. I guess someone was waiting for her.
- But it's impossible.
- If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.
Why sneak off like a thief?
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.
No, we've never met. I'm a friend of Sara's.
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to know where Sara is?
Well, she disappeared from school this morning.
Yes, it seems she left and took all her luggage.
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see you sometime today?
Well, I'm really worried about her.
Oh, great. Where?
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.
It's very upsetting. I can't understand why she did it.
I'm the one who's held responsible by their families.
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.
They said he'd be back by monday, and they don't know anything about her there.
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?
Yes, but before we both get upset, let's wait for the father's return.
Maybe they got together this morning and went off on their own.
I know her quite well. She was a patient of mine three years ago.
- Were you aware of that?
- No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.
Well, she had a nervous breakdown after her mother's death,
And she came to me for treatment.
After she got better again, we remained friends,
But lately she was upset about some notions put into her head by a friend of hers.
- Not you, I hope?
- No.
They were kind of wild ideas.
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,
And that the local people believed her to be a witch.
- I guess you knew that?
- No. But I have a strange feeling...
That somebody already told me about it... Or something similar.
I can't... can't remember.
Well, that really got Sara's imagination going. Earlier in the 19th century,
The Markos woman had been expelled from several european countries.
She seemed to have something about her which urged religious people to persecute her.
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,
She went by the name "The Black Queen."
After she settled down here, she became the subject of a lot of gossip.
Nevertheless, she managed to put her hands on a great deal of money,
And she founded the Tam academy...
At first a sort of school of dance and occult sciences.
But that didn't last long, because in 1905,
After being hounded and cursed at for ten years,
Madame Markos died in a fire.
That's all there is, as far as witchcraft is concerned.
The school was taken over by her favorite pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.
And soon the place became the famous dance academy.
But what does it mean to be a witch?
Well, as a believer in the material world and a psychiatrist to boot,
I'm convinced that the current spread of belief in magic and the occult...
Is part of mental illness.
Bad luck isn't brought by broken mirrors, but by broken minds.
Excuse me. Milius?
Professor Milius can answer your question better than I can.
He wrote a book called paranoia or magic, and believe me,
It's the final word on the subject.
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
- Fraulein.
- She's interested in your favorite subject:
Witches.
Can you tell her something about the mysterious?
Well, I have to go. I have an appointment to keep.
Keep me posted, Hmm?
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.
Ah, so, what would you like to know?
- Do you believe in the existence of witches?
- Ah.
I have known some women who are said to be witches.
- Really?
- I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.
I am of the opinion that it is an important appendage...
Of contemporary psychiatry.
You're skeptical, my dear.
Well, frankly, it is a little hard to believe.
- What do witches do?
- They are malefic, negative and destructive.
Their knowledge of the art of the occult gives them tremendous powers.
They can change the course of events and people's lives, but only to do harm.
- You don't believe me?
- No, I...
Their goal is to accumulate great personal wealth,
But that can only be achieved by injury to others.
They can cause suffering, sickness and even the death...
Of those who, for whatever reason, have offended them.
Why do you have all this interest in the occult?
Because some friends spoke to me about witches.
I read some stuff.
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?
Oh, yes. She was a very famous black queen.
A powerful witch with a tremendous talent for doing evil,
A real mistress of magic.
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?
Yes. And might there exist a guild of witches?
The correct term would be a coven of witches.
A woman becomes queen of her magic is a hundred times more powerful...
Than the rest of the coven, which is like a serpent.
Its strength rests with its leader...
That is, with its head.
A coven deprived of its leader is like a headless cobra:
Harmless.
Skepticism is the natural reaction of people nowadays,
But magic is ever present.
In other words:
Which means that magic is everywhere,
And all over the world, it's a recognized fact.
Always.
Mark? Mark?
Excuse me. Where is everybody?
They have all gone to the theater for the opening of the Bolshoi.
- Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
- I don't know.
Miss Tanner obtained tickets for everyone.
- Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
- Suzy? Hello?
- I can't...
- Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.
- Did something happen?
- Well, I haven't heard from Sara,
But a lot of strange things are happening.
I mean, for example, when I eat at night, I...
Hello? Hello, Frank?
Hello? Can you hear me?
Frank? Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?
No!
No!
They don't leave the school at all.
The front door is on the left. Their footsteps are going to the right.
Two, three, four, five, six,
Seven...
I can find out where they're going by counting their footsteps.
Twenty.
Who's there?
Carpet. That's why the footsteps stop here.
It's impossible. There's gotta be another way out of here.
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!
I told you: We must get rid of that bitch of an american girl!
Vanish... She must vanish! Make her disappear, understand?
She won't eat or drink anything this evening.
Vanish... She must vanish!
She must die, die, die!
Helena, give me power.
Sickness! Sickness!
Away with her! Away with trouble!
Death, death, death!
Who is it? Who's there?
I've been expecting you.
The American girl.
I knew you'd come.
You wanna kill me?
You wanna kill me Helena Markos?
You wanted to kill me!
You wanted to kill me!
What are you gonna do now?
Now death is coming for you!
You wanted to kill Helena Markos?
Hell is behind that door.
You're going to meet death now!
The living dead!
Witch, witch.
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe
It is the middle of the Dark Ages.
Ages darker than anyone
had ever expected.
An horrendous monster casts
a dreadful pall of fear...
... over a once happy land.
As towns and villages
are torn apart...
... the helpless survivors
seek refuge...
... behind the walls of the great city.
But out in the forest...
... in isolated pockets...
... still untouched by the ravages
of the monster...
... life and business goes on...
... as usual.
Thirteen, fourteen.
There's another little one.
- Fifteen.
- What are you doing, Dennis?
Stocktaking, Father.
- You took stock this morning.
- I did.
It never hurts to keep an account.
In business now, Father...
Never mind that nonsense and help with this cask.
All right, Father.
I'll finish stocktaking later.
You see, the secret of the craft is to keep the stake...
Take hold of the hoop.
Dennis. Ralph.
Good day, Mr. Fishfinger.
Can I be of some assistance?
- Well...
- Dennis, what are you...?
Yes, well, see, I need some barrels, Dennis...
...for shipping dried fish to the city.
Big demand there, since this monster scare.
Goodness, prices go up all the time.
That's great.
Tell me, Mr. Fishfinger...
...do you believe stories about villages being destroyed?
I haven't seen the monster myself.
When I was in Muckley the other day...
Muckley? That's a ways.
Two miles or more, easy.
Gosh, I'd like to travel someday.
- About the monster...
- Yes.
Well, this grain merchant, over in Muckley...
...he claimed that he'd actually seen it.
Turned his teeth snow-white overnight, they say.
- Anyway, about the barrels...
- Yes, well, must be cheap.
First, must be cheap.
We can attend to your needs.
Exactly how inexpensive?
- No more than tuppence apiece.
- Tuppence?
What are you talking about?
I can't turn out...
...a decent barrel for that price.
- Father, don't you think...?
- Be sensible.
They only have to last until they get to the city.
I don't make barrels to last two or three days, Fishfinger.
I make barrels to last a lifetime.
- Everybody knows.
- You'll never understand.
Or you either, Dennis, I'm afraid.
You don't want barrels.
You want bags.
Get out!
- Look, Father...
- Out!
Don't come back with shoddy deals.
- Yes. Goodbye.
- Tuppence!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Fishfinger.
- It's all right.
He's given me a very good idea.
Wait!
I think I can get...
Bye, Dennis.
Tuppence!
Griselda.
- Yeah?
- It is I, Dennis...
...come to see you.
- I see.
How are you, my love?
Have you missed me?
It's lovely to see you again.
I think about you all day long.
I dream of when I'll ask for your hand in marriage...
...and we'll build that cottage.
I'll come home, we'll have supper. Hey!
Roger, what are you doing?
Just you...
What?
Oh, Griselda. Sorry.
Griselda.
I can't ask for your love until
I can marry. Say you'll wait.
- Say I've got a chance...
- Let go!
- Why, Griselda, why?
- I've gotta scratch.
Oh, Griselda.
Griselda, l...
- Sorry, Dennis. How's your father?
- Never better, Mrs. Fishfinger.
- Is that Dennis Cooper?
- Yes.
Hello, Dennis. You've got garbage all over your vest.
Look after your appearance.
Bad for business.
By the way, thought you'd like to know...
...I got Wat the Mercer to run me up a few cloth bags.
I wish Father could've seen it your way.
Yes. A man's got to move with the times.
When you take the shop, we'll do business.
Oh, that won't be for some time yet.
It's getting late.
I'd better be going.
Okay by me.
Drop in anytime, Dennis.
Goodbye, Griselda.
Father!
- Is that you, Dennis?
- Yes, Father.
- Come closer, Dennis.
- Yes, Father.
- What happened?
- My heart.
I haven't long.
I'm going...
I'm going to...
Throw up?
No.
- Father.
- Son.
What shall I do without your guiding hand, without your skill?
- Son.
- Yes, Father?
I'll tell you...
...you're going to end up just like that...
...Fishfinger.
Who, me?
I know Mr. Fishfinger's a successful businessman, but...
Because you've got no understanding...
...of craftsmanship.
No appreciation of the beauty of wood.
- But...
- Because you're just a shallow...
...dull, pretentious...
- Father!
Little stocktaker!
Oh, Father, you're delirious.
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Yes, I do.
You whimpering...
...snotty-nosed...
...cretinous oaf!
- I've wanted to say this for years.
- We're not alone.
You're everything I despise!
Dad's raving, I'm afraid.
No, he's not.
You and your kind will drive good, honest craftsmen to the wall.
Do you hear? To the wall!
Honestly, I was only trying to improve the business.
You won't have my business...
...to improve anymore.
Not my cooperage.
Because I'm taking it with me!
- I don't understand.
- Don't understand? Damn ninny.
I'm renouncing you.
You're no craftsman's son.
Get out.
Out of my sight!
Stocktaker!
Griselda!
Griselda, my angel!
- Go away. We're eating.
- Is Griselda there?
- Is that Dennis?
- Yes, sir. Can I speak to Griselda?
- She's eating. What do you want?
- I'm going away to the city.
I'll come back and claim Griselda's hand.
So you will, Dennis. Goodbye.
Griselda, I'm going away.
Say something. Say anything.
- Pass the potatoes.
- I heard that! You are in there.
Darling, I'm going.
I may not see you...
That's rotten!
For me? Griselda, you do care.
A keepsake, something that will always remind me of you.
I'll carry this next to my heart until we next...
Say bye to the boy, Grisey.
Meet.
Goodbye, Griselda.
No, no! Stay away, stay away!
Stay away from me!
What's that? What was that?
Good morning, Your Majesty.
Good morning, Passelewe.
- Good morning.
- And to you, sir. A fine day.
Your business goes well, I trust.
One doesn't like to complain.
Your own?
One does one's best, you know.
I hear you're opening a shop.
By the town gate. An area of growth.
I agree.
I trust we'll hear an order soon.
Certainly.
If your prices are competitive.
Surely.
What's the latest wine-to-water ratio?
It's two wine to one water still.
It can't hold at that rate.
They're lucky to get wine.
Is that all? I detected a certain oneness in the last consignment.
That's odd. It was robust when it left my premises. Get a move on.
I'll send you a sample of our new port...
Move it, you lame buggers.
That would be kind.
- Why has the king called this council?
- Lord knows. Get going, you!
I hear he is urged to take measures against the monster.
Allowing the peasants to leave?
It could very well be. And that would not be good for business. Move it!
- After you.
- No, you first.
You're too kind.
Attention!
Our Most Glorious Majesty...
...King Bruno the Questionable.
Son of Olaf the Loud.
Oh, he's coming! He's coming!
- I'm not finished yet...
- Oh, look out! He's here!
- Your Majesty.
- Pay attention, Your Majesty.
You must see it's of the gravest urgency.
- Yes, yes. Of course.
- Jesus Christ!
Quick sire, down.
Stop it!
Come on.
Bless my soul!
Great-grandnephew...
...of Emperor Otto the Bent...
...conqueror...
...of Freedonia.
Let him go! Get up, man.
You'll get your rags all dirty.
Sire. Help us, sire.
The monster is ravaging the countryside.
It has destroyed our homes.
We haven't eaten in days.
- Weeks.
- Months.
- Except...
- I ate my shoe yesterday.
Oh, that's nothing.
I ate three toes off of my right foot.
- Terrible...
- That ain't your right foot.
Know-it-all!
Are you a doctor or something?
I saw a doctor once.
He didn't see me. I was hiding.
Your Majesty, save us from the great green beast.
- Gray!
- The side I saw was a dirty yellow.
- No, it were more orange.
- It was gray!
Now stop it. Stop it, all of you!
Go on, get out, get out!
What are you doing? Get out!
I'll read this to the king.
- Stop it!
- Go on!
It seems, Passelewe, that my subjects are becoming a pain in the arse.
Yes. Well, you must do something.
Your kingdom is paralysed with fear.
The city is packed with refugees.
They're easy prey for every sharp-witted merchant and trickster.
Past grand master of the Royal Order of Lowndes Victor, Saviour of Wales.
- Hey!
- And king.
Your Majesty, your council meets today in solemn session...
...to urgently discuss the terrible havoc...
...wreaked by the monster all over the countryside.
Nobody gets in here without money or possessions.
But I've got possessions. See?
That's only a rock.
- Only a rock?
- Yeah.
Listen, what if this is not just an ordinary rock?
What if this is a diamond?
It don't shine. Now get out of here!
Right, next.
- What have you got? Any grain? Cloth?
- I haven't got anything.
- But it's important that I get in.
- They all say that. Move on.
You don't understand.
I'm here for a job. I'm starting over.
I've got lots of good ideas...
Now look, sonny, shove off.
Wait a minute! What have you got here?
What's this?
You told us you had nothing.
- That's not for eating.
- What?
You could last for a week on that.
Just a minute.
What are you up to, sonny?
Oh, nothing. It's a memento.
A memento?
My sweetheart gave it to me.
She gave you that?
Yes.
Can I have it back, please?
God, she must really love you.
Do you really think so?
Yeah. I've got a sticky feeling inside me just thinking of it.
- You sure are a lucky guy.
- Come on, Fred. Cut it out.
- He's not getting in.
- Give him a break, just this once.
No chance. Now push off, you.
Just because he's got a potato...
That's what they all say.
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, you!
Come back!
That's far enough.
Let's have a look at your legs.
Next.
And so, Your Majesty...
...your great-great-great-great- great-grandfather...
...King Max the Vainglorious, by a tournament...
...chose from his knights a champion to free the kingdom from pestilence.
Mounted on his mighty charger,
Sir Bromiades waged...
What's that?
Quickly, man. Somebody might be trying to poison me.
- Plaster, Your Majesty.
- Oh. Carry on, Passelewe.
- Mounted on his...
- The 11th...
- Mounted on his mighty...
- No, wait. Twelfth century.
Shut up! Fool!
Carry on.
Until peace was once more restored to the kingdom.
With that, King Max rode back to the cheers of his subjects...
...who lined the road for 50 miles.
Fifty miles? Do you mean they cheered him all that way?
Wow! They certainly must have respected him.
You're right.
We'll hold a tournament.
It's years since we've heard the clash of sword against shield...
...the clamour of armoured knights crashing to the ground...
...the spurt of blood as the dagger is thrust into unprotected groin.
Oh, no, dear. No, no, no.
What I had in mind was a tournament à plaisance.
A plaisance?
Passelewe, do my ear holes hear aright?
A plaisance, with blunted sword and collared lance?
Where's the honour?
Where's the glory in buffoons playing pillow fights?
No! It must be L'outrance.
To the death.
- Please, Bruno, please.
- No, no, no.
Go with all speed and make the arrangements.
I can't wait to tell the princess.
Daughter?
Still working hard, I see.
You and the blessed Sisters of Misery.
Well, what are you making, daughter?
A tapestry depicting the famous siege of Castle Apcadwallader.
See? In this portion, the king is eating his horse...
...on the 98th day of the siege.
Splendid!
Very pretty, daughter.
But you were always...
Careful, Father.
Sister Winnet fell out last week.
Daughter, our kingdom will soon be free of the monster.
I have declared a tournament to find a champion to destroy it.
- What, the kingdom?
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, silly. The monster.
- Oh! I see.
Yes, and not only that.
The successful knight will win your hand in marriage.
Marriage?
Yes, well, you want to be married, surely?
- Of course, Daddy.
- Then...
But I want to marry a prince.
I'm supposed to.
That's why I wait here, like all the books say to.
Are any of the contestants princes?
- Well, not exactly.
- No?
No, but I could make one a prince, couldn't I?
- I mean the winner.
- It's not the same.
No, not really. Well, never mind.
Once the monster is destroyed, I will build you a beautiful bridal suite...
...in the lovely west tower.
On second thought...
...I think the view from the lovely east tower...
...would be infinitely more preferable.
- Who is it?
- Excuse me.
- Watch him.
- What does he want?
- Could I have some of your soup?
- He's after our soup!
- Somebody stop him!
- Poke a hole in him!
- I'll do anything.
- Will he gather firewood?
- What do you think?
- We should poke a hole in him.
I'll collect firewood if you let me have soup.
Where do I get it from?
Well, could I have a taste of the soup first?
Just see if I like it?
No, I thought not.
Well, I'd better go then.
The firewood, was it?
So, you've discovered my diamond mine?
- I was gathering firewood.
- Liar! It's diamonds you're after.
- Those aren't diamonds. They're rocks.
- Rocks?
Quick thinking, but not quick enough to save your skin!
The secret of my diamond mine dies with you!
I just dropped in to tell you to start without me.
Perhaps another night.
Hey! Hey! Hold it!
Open up there! Open the door!
Open it up! Open up in there!
Open it! Open the door! Open the door!
Rush hour!
Hearken before it is too late!
Repent! Cleanse yourselves!
The beast is at the gates!
The beast is at the gates!
- Cleanse yourselves!
- Horrible. Horrible.
Repent!
The beast is at the gates!
Cleanse yourselves!
All citizens, listen to me.
- Yeah, you better bloody listen!
- I hope you're listening!
Are you listening up?!
- You better listen up!
- Shut up!
- You were making noise.
- You never listen.
- Sin!
- Sin. Sin.
- The spikes of the pondylus.
- The pondylus.
- The crests of the dactylopters.
- Dactylopters.
- The trigla.
- The trigla.
- And the flying hogfish.
- And the flying hogfish.
Are as nothing compared to the beast that holds us prisoner!
- The beast...
- Flying hogfish?
I seen a gliding hogfish once.
Never flying. Not actually flying.
Stewed mackerel! Stewed mackerel!
Cabbages. Cabbages.
Rats killed, lady.
All very tidy. All very quiet.
- Morning.
- Oh, morning.
- I'm afraid I haven't got any money.
- Oh, that's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Is that yours?
- Well, of course it is.
Whose did you think it was?
- New to the city?
- Yes.
I came to start a new life here.
Get a job.
A job? No chance, son.
Oh, thank you, governor.
There must be plenty of opportunities.
Morning. Thank you.
I am a qualified cooper's apprentice.
Cooper's apprentice?
Well, what a coincidence.
I'm a cooper myself.
You may even have heard of me.
Wat Dabney.
Wat Dabney!
Not the Wat Dabney?
Inventor of the inverted firkin?
The very same, lad.
Now, if I can't get a job here, what chance have you got?
Come here. Here.
You see that plaque?
There, under the barrel.
That's a guild sign.
To work there, you've got to be a guild member.
But you're not, and I'm not and not likely to be.
That's not fair.
Fair or not, guilds have the town sewn up.
- Morning.
- What am I gonna do?
It's no good going around with a long face.
I did for weeks. Nearly starved.
Then only this morning,
I thought of this.
Hey...
Maybe we could team up together.
Sure.
- All we've got to do is...
- No. Goodbye.
I think it's a one-man business.
What a golden chance he's missing.
Attention! Attention...
...ladies and gentlemen, please.
In my humble capacity as herald to His...
Magnificence, King Bruno the Questionable...
...it is my privilege to announce...
...a joost...
Sorry, a joust...
...to the death, to choose a champion.
A champion to free the country...
To free the country from the torments and ravages of the...
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
As a reward for killing the monster...
...the king's champion will receive...
...half the princess's hand and the entire kingdom in marriage.
Correction. It is, of course...
It is, of course, the king's hand and half the princess's kingdom.
Excuse me.
Yes, I see. Thank you.
I've just received final confirmation of the final terms.
It is, of course, the princess's hand...
...and half the entire kingdom.
- Beware the Jabberwock, my son.
- Cabbages.
- The jaws that bite...
- Can I have one for nothing?
Get off.
Hot roasted rats! Only a farthing.
Rats on a stick!
Shortly, one of you will own this egg...
Get them hot! There you are, sonny. Off you go then.
Here! Get your rats! Only a farthing!
Turnips. Get your turnips.
Turnips here.
Turnips. Get your turnips.
Hey, watch it!
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.
I only wanted a turnip.
Just keep walking.
Hold up one minute.
I'll have you out in two shakes.
- Come on!
- I've got it, really.
How about that then?
First-class service as advertised.
Tell your friends.
- Where do you want it?
- By the burnishing pit.
Over by the burnishing pit.
Suppose you want this lot today.
What happened? A tree fall on him?
All right up there?
You're the master armourer!
Look at this arm brace!
You call that workmanship?
- I can't do...
- Look at this jambeau!
- What's wrong with it?
- It fell off!
You can't please people.
I sent for the best armour.
Arm braces are simple!
I don't want to hear it!
You said Friday afternoon!
And to me, that means Friday afternoon!
- I put three of my best men on the job.
- No good!
Get back!
Come on, boys. Come on.
And don't bother sending a bill, either!
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
I couldn't help noticing...
Get on out of here!
It would increase your efficiency if you moved your box to here.
You clumsy idiot!
- Let's get out of here.
- I was trying...
- You did beautifully!
- What about him?
Come on! I'll buy you a drink.
We'll go to the Queen's Haemorrhoids!
- That better?
- Oh, yeah.
- I can't remember when I ate last.
- I know.
I once went without food for 147 days.
147 days?
It was the siege of Caerlaverock.
Food was so short... What's the matter?
You got a stomachache?
I was trying to work out my next move.
So was I. Jeez, why worry?
I've got to! It's a big step coming from a small village to a city.
I know! That's what attracted me to the life of a squire, the travelling.
One day you're in Hertford hunting...
...the next you're in Scotland being burned at the stake. The adventure!
Like the time we was fighting the Blessed Sisters of St. Alopecia...
...a band of warrior nuns.
It sounds exciting.
But how secure is it?
- Now, you take coopering...
- Coopering?
Coopering! Hell!
That's no life for a man!
It is too. Barrels and casks are very important.
- Now, in commerce...
- Commerce!
Rubbish! Now you listen to me.
My knight was wounded, and there was I with my back to the wall...
...two great nuns coming at me with maces.
- Fighting nuns isn't respectable...
- Here, I'll show you! Come here!
Now you try. Come at me. Put up!
Pretend that drumstick is a mace.
Oh, come on!
Really let me have it.
- Come on!
- I can't.
Go for me!
I deflected the mace!
Then I grabbed her like this!
- Talk to the landlord.
- What?
Then I threw her again like this!
- Distract him.
- What for?
She was tough, see, but I grabbed her in the old...
- Keep him talking.
- I don't understand.
You will. Just do it!
Now here comes the best part.
She broke my grip.
She was coming in for the kill...
...when I turned tail and ran for it.
Slamming shut the castle doors,
I barred them...
...grabbing one of the novices as a hostage.
I fought my way up to the battlements...
...hacking and slashing as I went.
All in tears, in cuts!
Easily outdistancing the enemy,
I escaped.
Open this up! Open it up!
What the hell?
All right, men.
Coming up right away.
Let's have some decorum here.
- What do you want?
- Well, I was just wondering...
- Speak up! I'm a busy man.
- That's what I wanted to ask.
I used to be a cooper's apprentice, and I was...
Coming up. What is it? Spit it out.
I wondered if you could tell me about the inn business.
- I could change trades...
- What, now?
Mr. Rotcod, that party in the corner is waiting!
Tell them it's coming up.
Go away! I've no time.
It would help if you put the ale over here and the mead over here.
I noticed you're impairing efficiency by...
Will you get out of my way?
- Betty, come and give me a hand.
- Your wife's not here.
- Your wife?
- Not here?
Not here? Where is she?
- She's...
- She's what?
I don't know. Maybe she's...
And where's your friend, that loudmouthed squire?
- What?
- No.
- No what?
- They're not upstairs.
I mean, they're not here.
No, they're not here.
What?
You swine!
I'm gonna kill him, then I'm gonna kill you!
Right.
You toad!
Right! What's all this?
Brawling in the public streets.
Disturbing the king's peace?
This man... My wife...
Let go of me.
All right, hold him, Fred.
Now young fellow...
Here, I know you!
It was him who tried to get in the other day.
- My wife and the squire...
- The dungeon will sort them out.
Right. Then we can put irons on their legs, eh?
- But...
- You can't!
Destroy the monster?
If you destroy the monster, you destroy the city.
The long term will show that we owe the monster...
...a period of prosperity unprecedented in this kingdom.
This is ridiculous.
The tournament must continue.
A champion must be chosen.
Bruno, the merchants may be prospering...
...but your kingdom's collapsing.
- Oh, yes. Oh, well...
Now hear this!
The king, that flower of chivalry, that prince of monarchs...
...that paragon of potentates, is going to speak.
Hear the wisdom, witness the wit...
...observe the oratorical eloquence, lend an ear.
Beautifully said.
- To the mellow voice, the tender tones...
...the coruscating consonants...
...of His Majesty, King Bruno.
Very lovely. Well, l...
- who is going to give it to you straight...
...clarify the conundrums, dazzle us with logic.
My lords, Your Grace...
...Your Honour, the king!
Oh! Oh, yes.
Bishop, how can you, a man of God, say that the beast is good?
I welcome your question.
Indeed it may seem paradoxical...
...but since the advent of the beast, church attendance has tripled!
Tithing has increased. Long lines of sinners wait eagerly for confession.
- Piety has never been higher.
- Oh, bravo.
- Well, my lord bishop...
- Oh, yes.
The king will speak. The king.
Thank you.
- Guard!
- Sire.
- Kill that man.
- Sire.
What? Who?
Anyway, the most potent...
...most poetical...
...most prestigious...
Well, Your Majesty, what is your opinion?
- Give us guidance.
- Even a hint.
I think...
What's that? What's going on here?
Just one moment.
What's going on here?
Who dares sully my castle with unseemly brawls?
Guards, bring them in!
We'll show them who's king here.
- But we have important matters...
- Important matters, Passelewe?
Surely keeping the peace in my own castle is important.
First things first!
They'll taste the king's justice.
Put me down!
Silence!
Silence!
Now what's this all about?
- The squire! Behind my back!
- Calm, my man.
Remember you're in the presence of your king.
Guards, let him go.
Let him speak.
Your Majesty, this man...
This man...
- What's going on here?
- Look out, sire! Get down!
- Hold it!
- Get him!
This is outrageous!
- Weren't there two of them to start?
- Yes, sir.
- Where's the other one got to?
- I don't know, sir.
Right. Then it falls upon us to find this man guilty.
Guilty? Guilty of what, sire?
Cannibalism.
- Keep your eyes peeled.
- Right.
Quick, down this way!
- Check up there.
- No. Come on!
A man!
Watch the princess!
- A man!
- At last you've come!
- I'm sorry, barging in...
- Don't be shy.
I knew you'd come someday.
- I was coming up the stairs...
- Put this on. You turn around!
- I don't want to bother...
- You must have travelled far to come.
Swum rivers, climbed mountains, fought battles.
You can turn around now.
There. Do I come up to your expectations?
Do you find me beautiful?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Oh, come, my prince. Don't be shy.
But I can't.
I'm not dressed for the occasion.
Tush.
You mustn't worry about those filthy peasant rags...
...which you were no doubt forced to don.
Soon we'll have you attired once more in princely finery.
No. You see, there's been some mistake.
- My name is Dennis.
- Prince Dennis.
- No, Dennis Cooper. I used to be...
- Your face. You're wounded.
- No, it's nothing. Just a bruise.
- Just a bruise?
How brave you are, my prince...
...for surely it must have been a terrible blow.
No, an innkeeper sat on me.
You see, he thought...
Well, this squire, you see, his wife...
What, the innkeeper's wife was a squire?
I've been dreaming of this day for so long...
...but little did I expect one so brave and valiant and wise...
...one who's crossed the seven seas for me...
...and galloped across deserts and canyons to be by my side at last.
- My love.
- Come.
Tell me of your adventures.
We must get to know each other before we're married.
Married? No, I'm sorry, miss.
I can't do that.
Can't?
My prince, did I hear you right?
- It's very kind of you to ask...
- No, don't tell me. I know.
- I know.
- You know?
In your adventures, you rescued a maiden chained to a dark cliff.
- No, not exactly.
- She fell in love. You fell in love.
There and then before the gods, you made a pact only death could break.
- No, you're on the wrong tack.
- Come.
You must not linger in idle conversation.
You gained entry to the castle by stealth...
...and now you must leave in the same way.
I know.
Sister Jessica, give your habit to the prince.
- My habit, princess?
- Yes, and hurry.
But what's wrong with Sister Marian's habit?
Don't be silly. Here.
Now, my prince, this is the plan.
Tomorrow is St. Talulah's Day, and by first light...
...a nun must depart this city and lay fresh dogwort...
...on the spot where St. Talulah was murdered by the Benslow Four.
You shall be that nun. Sister Jessica?
Sister Jessica.
- Well, give it to the prince.
- Thank you, Sister...
Then, proceed to the western wall...
...but by the back streets only!
When you get to the gate, say:
"I have the holy dogwort for St. Talulah's spot.
Let me pass that I might pray awhile."
Oh, my prince.
- Is this yours?
- Yes. No!
Please let me have it.
Let me have it as a souvenir of our hopeless, flawless love.
- I'll cherish it always.
- I can't...
And now, my prince, you must flee!
No! No, don't kiss me.
- I couldn't stand it.
- I wasn't going to.
Just go.
Just go, my prince.
And remember:
"I have the holy dogwort for St. Talulah's spot."
In Latin, my love.
- Evening, Sister.
- Evening.
What have we got here?
A strange face?
And a pretty one.
Well, now, let's have a look.
Let's have a kiss!
- Come on, sarge. She's a nun.
- So she is.
Let's have a Christian kiss.
- What's the matter, sarge?
- Put me to bed, boys. Put me to bed.
- It's the devil in the guise of a nun!
- It's a nun in the guise of the devil!
- Get her!
- Get him!
Get them both!
Citizens! A sacrifice must be made to the monster...
...that lurks in the darkness in wait for us all!
And what better than to sacrifice one of the beast's own servants...
...whom we caught masquerading as a holy sister of the Mother Church?
We will fire him into the eternal darkness...
...as a testimony to our piety and godliness.
Imagine his agony as the flames rise higher...
...higher until he is but a ball of living fire!
Oh, the agony!
Imagine his horror as the mighty ballistic device...
...hurls him high into the depths of the blackened sky!
Are you imagining the horror?
Imagine the terror of his suspense...
...as our poor sacrifice waits...
...for the darkling earth to rise up and crush him to its harsh bosom!
Oh, the suspense!
- The incertitude!
- Oh, the incertitude!
I like suspense.
Imagine his final horror...
...as his miserable life is snuffed out...
...in a glorious bone-crushing cascade of phosphorescence...
...as he finally, agonizingly smashes into the ground!
- That's not fair, that.
- No, it's definitely not fair.
What's not fair?
- How come he gets to go?
- Why should he have the pain?
And that bone-crushing horror.
I want to go!
- I want to go!
- I want to burn.
I want to feel my bones burst into a billion pieces!
I want to trace across the firmament...
...a glowing ball of flame...
...a testament to our godliness and piety!
- What does that mean?
- I don't know, but I want it!
I want it!
- Hot!
- Fire!
Nice.
Another glorious day for a tournament, eh, Passelewe?
I suppose so, Your Majesty.
You suppose so?
Suppose so?
Buck up, man. Buck up.
It's tournament time!
Certainly, Majesty.
But I can't but think there must be a better way to choose a champion.
A better way? What better than the shattering of lances?
The flailing of the mace?
The thrust of swords?
The ring of fauchon en cuissard?
What better way than an honest tournament, Passelewe? Yes.
My dear, how beautiful you look.
Yes.
- What on earth is that?
- But, Dad...
Daddy!
Look at that! Did you see that?
Right in the middle of the old demi-brassarts. Jolly good. Bravo!
Another one on the maimed list.
Probably dead by now.
A scratch.
Plenty more where he came from.
Not really, sire.
What do you mean, Passelewe,
"Not really, sire"?
Now, which part of this is giving you difficulty?
Well, all of it, frankly.
What do you mean by it?
I mean by saying "Not really, sire," the true situation is likely to be...
...ipso facto, to the contrary...
...and the exact opposite to that which you perceive.
I appended, because, after all, you are the king, aren't you?
And that's a reasonable way of addressing a monarch.
- Daddy.
- What is it, darling?
- What is it?
- Look at that brute of a knight.
- I couldn't marry anything like that.
- Of course not. You won't have to.
He won't...
...win.
Passelewe, what were we discussing a moment ago?
- The toll of your knights, sire.
- Now, just a moment, Passelewe.
You used that "sire" for the same reason you used it in the first place?
- Right.
- Right.
- I thought so.
- Right.
According to my records,
65% of the knights of your realm...
...have been killed or maimed in the tournament.
Passelewe, that's no figure at all.
No figure at all.
Now, if it was 83.3% or 97.4%, now that is a true percentage...
...in the truest sense.
- My dearest Bruno, do listen.
If this continues, even until the end of the week, where...
- Hold it!
- What?
This one I must see.
There must be a better way of choosing.
Ethel? Is that you, Ethel?
I wondered what happened to you last night.
Can't talk.
Due in the lists in 10 minutes.
I'm coming, Mother.
Watch where you're getting the blood! Christ!
- How else can we choose a champion?
- We could call an election.
Election? Oh, no. Nonsense.
It wouldn't be fair to the knights.
- They could draw lots.
- Draw lots?
Bless my soul. You might as well do it dip, dip, dip, my little ship...
...or one potato, two potatoes.
Or even hide and seek.
Coming!
The cardinal said,
"I asked for 13 vergers.
Why have you brought me 13 virgins?"
Now, we're in the garden and a thousand voices said as one man:
"Ave, ave, passed through this way."
Ave, ave, what?
- Why do I need to say ave?
- Just sit back...
...and let something nice happen to you for a change.
Looks like they've chosen a champion.
Can you see who it is?
It's my boss. Christ.
Well, congratulations, sire.
We have a champion.
Good. Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes. That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
They will find him, won't they?
- You must be very proud.
- Proud, you shit? Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well. Christ, what luck!
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
- No, no, not that. Sit the vigil.
- Me?
I could give you my hat, my cape.
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that. It's not right.
- Who'll know? Come on!
- A beast!
- Here I am.
Oh, not you!
Forget it.
- Squire? What squire?
- You know what squire.
Oh, my rheumatism. That cell was so damp. Two whole nights.
Oh, you poor dear.
Come, let me undress you and put you to bed.
It must have been an awful experience.
It was.
Oh, Betty. Your hands are so soft and warm.
You don't really think there was a squire up here in our bed, do you?
- Well...
- Do you? Come, let me take those off.
And that.
Doesn't that feel better?
Bernard, my darling.
Come.
Citizens...
...nobles...
...gentry!
The king.
Me? Oh, yes.
Good Sir Knight, you have proved your worth on the field of honour.
And now you must prove yourself in mortal combat...
...with a monster so terrifying, so awe-inspiring, so horrible...
...so soul-destroying that even I would hesitate...
...to meet it face to face...
...in hand-to-hand combat.
Was that all right?
Well, I suppose so, my darling.
And so, go forth and slay the beast.
And take with you the royal blessings...
...and also the blessings of Mother Church.
Bishop!
- Get out of here!
- Bloody sods!
- Is that all?
- That's it.
Right. Herald?
Have the gates opened.
Well, carry on!
Open the gates!
Fare well.
Wait!
He took his vorpal sword in hand
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought
And as in uffish thought he stood
The Jabberwock, with eyes aflame
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood
And burbled as it came
Lance.
Lance, lance.
Come on. Come on.
Griselda.
Go get them, boys!
Monster? Monster?
Where monster?
There he is!
Don't let him get away.
Monster? Monster?
I am here, Griselda. Fear not.
Gee, a knight!
I never saw a knight before.
Oh, Mr. Fishfinger!
Oh, stop dribbling, woman.
Oh, bless you. O noble lad.
Oh, thank you.
Stand aside, Mrs. Fishfinger.
Sorry. Are you all right?
You almost cut my arm off!
You always were a clumsy one,
Dennis Cooper.
Shame on you!
Get out! Jesus!
I could get blood poisoning.
Was that sword sterilized?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I'll bind it up. I'll get bandages.
Jesus. Get off!
Dad!
- What?
- Look.
Good Sir Knight. Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
Very gracious of you, Sir Knight.
We're very undeserving, really.
We're just humble fisher folk.
However, we do have this maiden daughter.
As there is this custom...
...the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
Say hello to the knight,
Griselda honey.
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
What do you say, Sir Knight?
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?
- Hark. Be gone.
- Wait!
- Come back here!
Sir Knight, come back, please!
Griselda. Mr. Fishfinger.
I've got to go. Sorry about your hand.
It hurts!
I've missed you.
I've kept your potato.
Bye!
You really are a big disappointment to me.
I thought you were gonna make something of yourself.
He is the king's champion!
Call yourself an eligible suitor for our fair Griselda? You're a vagrant!
Hold him, Madge. Hold him!
You leave her alone. Leave her alone.
Go on!
Someone at the door, dear.
- We must make up our minds.
- Gentlemen!
- We can't delay.
- Let's do something.
This king's champion must be stopped.
The monster must be protected.
If he kills the monster, we'll all be ruined.
Let me prevail upon you.
No more argy-bargy is necessary because I have a plan.
Behold! The Black Knight.
Wonderful!
We must be getting closer.
Grease. Grease.
Now that.
Get him.
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy
- Oh, frabjous day!
- The monster's dead!
The monster's dead!
Stop! No one's to enter the city unless they have money.
Stop, I say!
Oh, my God!
Cancel those shipments of wine, grain, straw!
Cancel everything!
- Dennis, here she is. Griselda!
- Here I am.
It's me!
Dennis, it was always you!
You's the one we was pushing for.
We'll have the wedding tomorrow.
This afternoon.
We'll get the bishop.
Dennis, you're wonderful.
Griselda, at last we can have the life we always wanted.
My boy, congratulations.
We offer you our heartfelt thanks.
You have cleared the kingdom of a great menace.
I am happy to fulfill my promise and to bestow upon you...
- What's his name?
- It's Dennis.
Dennis Cooper, Your Royalshipness.
That's his fiancée, my daughter.
You, Dennis...
...one half of my entire kingdom.
And the hand in marriage of my daughter, the princess.
Come, my boy. To the palace!
Griselda!
I pronounce you man and wife.
Prince and princess!
Dennis!
Griselda!
Whose idea was it to run him off without a wedding? Shut up!
Look out, sire!

Oh, hello there, honey!
- Nice to see you!
- This is my son.
How do you do?
Dorothy, this here's Gil Warren.
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.
Don't worry, Gil.
She's just shy.
I brought you some tea.
Look! Here they come.
Come on, they're coming!
Shh.
We're getting ready to set the table.
Take these checkers someplace else.
Here, you take these.
Come on, Henry, be careful.
Come on.
- Oh, man, you always drop the checkers when I'm...
- That's the way you win!
Toto! Toto! Toto baby!

Emergency snow alert is now in effect.
No automobiles are to be driven without snow tires or chains.
Winds up to 45 miles per hour...
That was a great dinner, Emma.
- That baby!
- You're a grandpa!
- Our daughter's fine.
- Mmm.
But Dorothy.
Give her time, honey.
Give her time.
Those dishes ain't gonna wash themselves.
Mrs. Warren's son looks real fine, don't he?
Aunt Em, please, no more matchmaking.
Did you make the decision about that new school yet?
It's no decision to make.
But, honey, it's a chance to teach in high school.
Get away from that kindergarten once and for all. It's more money.
But besides the money, it's a chance for you to be with older students.
Almost adults.
- I like it with the kids, Aunt Em.
- I know you do, honey.
And you're a fine teacher.
But that's why I think you'd enjoy teachin' high school.
Have a chance to be with the students for four years...
...such an important time in their development.
I'm really happy with the kids, Aunt Em.
But you been there for three years already.
It's time you got out of that sandbox and into some new people, new neighborhood.
Girl, do you know you're
24 years old and you've...
Never been south of 125th Street?
Well, you haven't.
Oh, here we go again.
You get me so worked up...
...that I'm beginning to sound like a Jewish mother.
I can't see how goin' south of 125th
Street ever made anybody's life better.
And you're never gonna know unless you try, are you?
Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that.
Why don't you go in and relax?
I can do... Let me do that.
Listen, I know gettin' out in that world ain't easy...
...leaving Uncle Henry and me.
But we'll always be here for ya, Dorothy.
And whatever your fears are, well...
...they'll be defeated just by facing up to 'em.
Now, you take that new job and find a place for you and Toto.
It's time for you to make a home of your own.
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Toto!
# La, la, la, la, la #
# La, la, la, la #
Toto! Where are you?
Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto!
Oh!
Toto, Toto.
- Toto, Toto.
- To... To... Toto!
- Toto, Toto. Toto, Toto.
- To... To... To...
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!
God, where am I?
Toto! Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
No! No!
- Relax, Mama!
- We just wanna lay a little thanks on ya.
- What?
- You know, heavy on the gratitude department.
- Gratitude? For what?
- For curling the curse.
- For leveling the leech.
- For killing our oppressor.
Uh! I never killed nothin' in my life.
- Never killed the point?
- A pint?
- A good story?
- The umpire?
- No!
- Never killed no time?
No, I told you!
I never killed nothin'!
Well, then, I think you graduated...
...from the bush leagues into the majors, girl.
Toto?
Can you dig this?
- Who is it?
- Ain't no more "is"!
Thanks to you, it's a "was"!
- She was Evermean.
- The Wicked Witch from the East.
And they didn't call her Evermean for nothin'!
She was the parks department commissioner!
Caught us paintin' on her playground walls.
- Turned us into graffiti!
- And there we stayed.
- Flat, splat and stuck like that!
- Doomed as cartoons forever.
'Til you burned alphabet through the sky and ended the curse.
- And the "curseress. "
- Givin' a new lease on life to us...
The Munchkins, most recently referred to as the "cursees. "
Toto.
Let's hear it for
Super Witch and her Wonder Dog!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Miss One!
Come to Mama, you hot little digits!
Let me lay my 20-20s on ya!
Oh, how I love you!
Let me... Mmm!
Count the ways!
Oh, mmm! Mmm!
Innumerable blessings, countless felicitations.
Thank you beyond number and additional good stuff!
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to kill her.
Oh, don't be all sixes and sevens, honey.
You did the world a multitudinous service by 86ing ol' Evermean.
Bottom line, honey, this chick put the "ugh" in ugly.
But she sure had pretty shoes, didn't she? Yah!
I don't want these shoes.
I wanna go home.
I wouldn't discount those shoes, honey.
And don't ever take 'em off until you do get home.
Remember Miss One told ya.
Oh, pardon me.
Miss One's the name if you haven't guessed by now.
Numbers is my game and now that you've freed us... we can all go back to runnin' our business, ahem.
We can all go back to runnin' our business.
But where am I?
Where am I?
You're in Munchkin Land!
- The indivisible Land of Oz!
- Oz?
But where's my home?
Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York?
- New York?
- 433 Prospect Place.
Ooh! Four, three, three.
You wanna play more than one number today, honey?
I got a freedom special, three numbers for the price...
No, I don't wanna play any numbers.
I just wanna get home!
Oh, well, now that ol'
Evermean's number's up...
...that leaves only three witches in Oz.
One, myself, but my powers don't amount to much.
And number two, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South.
Oh, she's a real star, but you can hardly catch her in.
And number three, the multi-horrored
Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West.
Evermean's even uglier sister!
But I don't think it'd be a good time to ask her for a favor.
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz could cipher how to get you back to...
- Where'd you say that place was?
- The Wiz?
What's a Wiz?
What's a... What's a Wiz?
Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate.
The "X" quotient, the new math.
The common denominator, the main man.
The head honcho!
Bottom line, honey.
Numero uno!
- Where is he? How do I find him?
- Catch this number, honey.

Wait.

Wait! Mister, please wait!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Succulent and divine!
- Delicious and nutritious.
- Brother crows, this is good stuff!
I'm glad you fellows are enjoying your breakfast.
Is today the day you're gonna help me get down from here?
Help you down?
What is goin' down in that hayloft you call a head?
Didn't we tell you yesterday and the day before that...
- And the day before that...
- That you can't get down?
This is your life, buddy, all hung up!
Besides, Clyde...
...us crows are just thinkin' of you.
There ain't nothin' to get down for!
But I was just thinkin', just once, fellas...
...for a little while to walk in my garden, wouldn't that be terrific?
- Walk!
- You can't walk!
Why, you just a straw paper dummy!
You're right, fellas.
I was just bein' selfish.
And stupid as usual!
- But I was readin' this morning that most people...
- Oh, man!
Look, didn't we tell you readin' was a waste of time?
- But Bacon here said...
- Bacon? Once over lightly, please!
"Knowledge is power. "
- See, and, uh, Cicero, he said...
- Cicero-ro-row!
"More men are ennobled by study than by nature. "
And over here, especially apropos in my situation...
...i. E., stuck up on this here pole:
"Do not accept any situation.
Question, argue and explore. "
Now who you gonna believe?
- Mr. Nobody on that paper?
- Fellas, please!
Or your good friends, the crows?
Yeah, who have dedicated their lives to educatin' you.
- Yeah!
- Sounds to me, fellas...
...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot the crow commandments again.
Fellas, I did not forget the crow commandments. Please!
Run 'em by me!
Run 'em by me.
- Thou shalt honor all crows.
- Right on!
- Proceed!
- Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature.
- Trash! Trash!
- And the most important one!
Thou shalt never, never get down off of this here pole!
You got it, Clyde!
And the crow anthem!
I gotta sing that thing again?
# You gotta libretti it
'til you get it #
- # Elucidate #
- # Reiterate #
# And syncopate #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# People keep sayin' #
# Things are gonna change but they look just like #
# They're stayin' the same #
# You get in way over your head #
# And you only got yourself to blame #
- # You can't win, child #
- # You can't win, child #
# You can't break even #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
The world keeps movin' #
# And you're standin' far behind #
# People keep sayin' #
- # Things'll get better #
- # Just to ease your state of mind #
# So you lean back #
# And you smoke that smoke #
# And you drink your glass of wine #
# Sayin' you can't win child #
# You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't win #
# You can't win no way if your story stays the same #
- # You ain't winnin' #
- # Oh, no #
# But I'd like to see you
I'm awfully glad you came #
# Better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin' #
# Then the world has got no shame #
# You can't win, child #
# Can't break even
Can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# Ain't the way it's supposed to be #
- # You'll be spendin' your little bit of money #
- # Oh, no #
# While someone else rides for free #
- # Learned your lesson #
- Ooh!
# Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame #
- # And you can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
# You can't win, child
Can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't get out #
Ooh!
# Of the game #
# No, no, no ##
- I'll, I'll help you down.
- What?
You will?
What's she doing here?
- Get her outta here.
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo, shoo, go on about your business.
Shoo!
Ooh!
- Just hold on.
- This is just an experiment.
The results of the first experiment:
Subject is a hopeless failure.
- You are not.
- I am.
You're just a product of some negative thinking.
First thing we have to do is get rid of these crows.
Come on, Toto, sic 'em!
Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo! Before I call the taxidermist, you turkeys!
Get off me, dog!
Good boy, Toto.
We can go now.
You okay?
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!
I think I'm gonna make it this time.
You sure are.
Just a little self-confidence...
...and coordination.
You're gonna be fine.
You mean, all this time the only thing standing between...
...hangin' up there and livin' it up down here... were those crows?
Well, they told you you couldn't do it and you believed them.
If I only had a brain, I would have figured that out a long time ago.
There you go with that negative thinkin' again.
- Everybody has a brain.
- Uh-uh.
Not me, look.
Oh.
Garbage?
"Lgnorance is the night of the mind...
...a night without moon or star. "
Confucius said that.
I'm on my way to find the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home.
That's nice. Thank you.
Good luck.
I thought maybe he could get you a brain.
You think that he could...
And Toto and me, we could sure use some company.
Besides, you have nothin' to lose.
I don't, do I?
That was so smart of you!
I wish I thought of that.
Indications are it would be very advantageous for me to join you.
Good.
Um, we only have one problem.
The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick
Road, but I haven't been able to find it.
- Yellow Brick Road?
- There it is!
Hey, wait! Wait!
Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"?
- Yes!
- Look over here!
We don't need no cabs.
- Say, what's your name?
- My name is... Dorothy.
Dorothy and Toto?
What intelligent names!
Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have to find our own Yellow Brick Road.
# Ease on down
Ease on dow... #
- Down the road!
- There it is!
# Ease on down #
- Oh!
- # Ease on... Down #
- Down the road!
- Oh!
# Don't you carry nothin' #

- There it is!
Dorothy! Look! Dorothy!
Aaah!
Ta-da!
Whoo! Come on, Dorothy!
Come on!
Whoo!
# Come on and ease on down ease on down the road #

# Ease on down ease, ease on down #

- Help!
Help!
Help?
Help? Where?
Help! Help!
Over here!
Help!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Where are you?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Step right up and save a life!
Ooh! Ooh!
I'm in a little bit of a squeeze, brother. Can you give me a hand?
Dorothy?
Oh, how terrible.
- Don't move.
- Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades.
We'll be right back.
Oh, he's so brave.
He's probably in shock.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be in shock... Just once.
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
No apology necessary. I told you nothing hurts me. I have no feelings.
The genius who created me only took care of my dashing good looks...
...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible attraction to the wrong women.
What he forgot to add... was a heart.
But... Everyone has a heart.
Alas, everyone but yours truly.
Hello!
Nobody home in Soulville.
Rid of you!
Free from your posterior prison!
You hulking she devil!
Don't hear ya laughing now.
We were abandoned here when this park went "el foldo. "
Ah, it was a sad day.
There's not much amusement to the closing down of an amusement park.
But yours truly is an old trooper!
I quickly made plans for the future.
But alas, I was felled by my 4th wife, Teenie.
Crushed in my prime!
There, how does that feel?
But that's the whole tragic point, my friends.
# What would I do #
# If I could suddenly feel #
# And to know once again #
# That what I feel is real #
# I could cry
I could smile #
# I might lay back for a while #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
# If I could feel #
# What would I do #
# If I could reach inside of me #
# And to know how it feels to say #
# I like what I see #
# And I'd be more #
# Than glad to share #
# All that I have inside of here #
# And the songs my heart might bring #
# You'd be more than glad to sing #
# And if tears should fall from my eyes #
# Just think of all the wounds they could mend #
# And just think of all the time
I could spend #
# Just being vulnerable again #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What, what would I do #
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
# If I could feel ##
I'm just a miserable hunk of junk.
Me!
Once the fastest metal mouth on the midway.
Frozen... ironically in a position
I had assumed all too often.
A seat cushion for Teenie!
Teenie!
- Teenie!
- Dorothy!
- Teenie! Teenie!
- Are you thinkin' what I am?
- Teenie!
- You're so smart!
Teenie! Teen...
You could come with us to see the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home...
...and he's gonna get the Scarecrow some brains.
Maybe he could get you a heart.
You're not just flimflammin' an ol' flimflammer, are ya?
Could I come with ya?
- Of course.
- "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. "
What's wrong?
He rusted himself cryin'.
Oil! Oil!
- What?
- Oil!
- Find some oil!
- Some oil!
Oil!
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it trickle down my spine #
# If you don't have STP #
# Crisco will do just fine #
# Slide some to my elbow #
# And to my fingers if you would #
# Slide some oil to me, girl #
# Whoo, don't that feel good #
# Slide some oil to my feet #
# Look-a there
I got toes again #
# Come on slide some oil to my knees #
# And let me see if I can bend #
# Slide some oil to me #
# I'm beginnin' to feel just fine #
# Slide some oil down my throat #
# And let me lubricate my mind #
# Slide some oil to me #
# Go ahead hit my shoulder blades #
# Those who don't have to lubricate #
# Sure got it made #
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it slip down my side.
# Laying there in one position #
# Sure done made me tired #
Now watch me dance.
Come on, you metal metatarsals, don't fail me now.
Ah-ha! Fall in line and get left behind.
Two bits!
Let me show you my
Saturday night finish!
Oh! Music man!
Let me hear that band!
# Don't turn the water on me #
# Just let me burn and let me lubricate #
# My mind ##
Come on!
# There may be times you think you've lost your mind #
# These steps you're takin' leave you steps behind #
# The road you're walkin' might be long sometimes #
# But you keep on steppin' and you'll be just fine #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on and ease on down ease on down the road #
# Don't you carry nothin' that might be a load #
# Come on, ease on down down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down ##
Hey! Look at me walkin'!
- Stop the music!
- What's the matter? You need more oil?
No! That beast!
He's checkin' us out.
Oh, it's just a statue.
Made of stone, see?
Now even a dummy like me knows a stone lion...
...can't... Check you out.
# Say what you wanna but I'm here to stay #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# Now you can go where you're gonna #
# But don't get in my way
I'm a mean ol' lion #
# You'll be standing in a draft #
# If you don't hear me laugh #
Ha-ha!
# If you have to come around #
# You best not make me frown #
# Or I just might knock you down #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# You know I'm ready to fight and turn your day into night #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# If you're half bright you'll detour to the right #
# From a mean ol' lion #
# And all you strangers got to beware #
# This is the king of the jungle here #
# And if I happen to let you slide #
# Don't stand there run and hide #
# You just, you just caught my better side #
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion #
# Look, you better beware #
# This is the, the king of the jungle here #
# And if I happen to let you slide #
# Don't stand there run and hide #
# You just done caught my better side #
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion #
Toto!
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion ##
How dare you touch...
...the personage of a king?
You tacky package of horse fodder.
Begone, you overexcited slot machine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! You mangy mutt! Oh!
Toto!
Oh!
He bit my paw!
King of the jungle?
- King of the cowards.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself, scaring us like that.
You big scaredy-cat!
I can't scare anything.
I can't even scare a scarecrow...
...a tin man or a little puppy, anything.
It's no wonder they drummed me out of the jungle.
- I.O.B.K.!
- I.O.B.K.?
Incapable Of Being King!
No! Wait, wait! Wait!
I was exiled in disgrace.
I thought I'd be safe here.
No one would... discover my terrible secret.
Uh, that I'm...
...a lion without any courage!
"Uneasy lies the head...
...that wears a crown. "
W. Shakespeare.
Well, I thought
I'd seen 'em all.
But never, never have I seen...
...a lion... without courage.
Lion!
Lion!
Maybe the Wiz could give you some courage.
- It's a good idea.
- Capital suggestion.
- Capital! He's gonna get me a heart.
- And me some brains.
Come with us to Emerald City.
I'd love to, but I can't.
But why?
Because... I'm scared!
Oh.
# Oh, there #
# May be times #
# When you wish you wasn't born #
# And you wake one morning to find your courage gone #
# But just know that feelin' only lasts a little while #
# You just stick with us
We'll show you how to smile #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Don't you carry nothin' that might be a load #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down, down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# I gotta get down gotta get, gotta, gotta #
# Gotta, gotta, gotta getta, getta, getta #
# Ease on down the road ease on down the road ##
Ah, my ma would be so proud.
Going to see the Wiz!
My mama used to always say to me, Fleet!
Fleet?
That's my name,
Fleetwood Coup de Ville.
- Mama had high ideals.
- Yeah!
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah!
I ain't too happy underground, you all.
- How does he do that?
- It's just a hoax, my friend.
He's got a little motor in his... Pocket.
- Lion! Lion!
- Help!
- Oh, my... Please, somebody!
- Shh!
Lion! Lion!
Owww! Lion!
Li...
Lion!
Aaah!
Lion, save me!
Dorothy!
Toto! Toto, Toto, Toto.
Hey!
Oh! Wait!
- Where's the lion?
- I'm coming!
- Wait, wait!
- Lion!
Come on! Let's go!
- Hurry up!
- This way, this way! Wait for me!
Hey!
Sssss!
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
My queen, if you'll allow me, like I say...
...you stick with the big kitty and you'll be in heaven.
Sssss!
Outta the frying pan, into the...
This is like a setup.
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!
Don't follow them! Don't!
Oh, please! It's a setup!
- Stop!
- Come back!
Jump! Don't go in there!
Whoo, whoo!
Oh! Dorothy! Lion!
- I can't move him! I can't move him!
- Dorothy?
- Get Toto, we'll come back for him.
- Toto!
Oh, look, poor little Toto!
Sweet little Toto.
What are we going to do?
- All is lost!
- Dorothy!
Dorothy, please.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, all is lost.
# How high the moon #
What's happenin', babe?
Hey, Lion's okay!
- Hey, baby!
- Come and cry over here!
- Teenie! Think of Teenie!
- Dor... Dorothy?
- Think of Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie, uh, Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie!
- It's all my fault!
Uh, Teenie! Uh, Teenie!
Oh, mighty Zeus!
And gods of the universe!
Why have you cursed this low, mangy animal so?
Once I was a king, a lion amongst lions!
Ruler of a beautiful kingdom by a waterfall.
Attended by butterflies and sparrows.
And now banished for lack of courage...
I cannot even protect these friends who have been so kind.
Oh, I was strong and brave...
...in the subway only to be foolish and weak again.
I led us into the very jaws of death!
Oh, let me end it all!
- Lion, Lion!
- No!
No, let me splatter to the four winds!
It's all right, Lion.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
- The worst is over, my furry friend.
- No!
Would you lay an appropriate quote on this poor beasty brother?
"Showers expected late tomorrow. "
Lion?
# There is a place #
# We'll go #
# Where there is mostly quiet #
# Flowers and butterflies #
# A rainbow lives beside it #
# And from a velvet sky #
# The summer storm #
# You can feel #
# The coolness in the air #
# But you're still #
# Warm #
# And then a mighty roar #
# Will start the sky #
# To cryin' #
# But not even lightning #
# Will be frightening #
# My lion #
# And with no fear inside #
# No need to run #
# No need to hide #
# You're standing strong #
# And tall #
# You're the bravest #
# Of them all #
# If on courage #
# You must call #
# Then just keep on tryin' #
# And tryin' #
# You're a lion #
# In your own way #
# Be a lion #
Come on, be a lion.

- How do we get in?
- And how do you do?
- Good evening there, brother.
- This place is nice.
The service entrance is at the side.
We're here to see the Wiz.
This is where the Wiz lives, isn't it?
May I welcome you to the Emerald City.
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# I want to be seen green #
# Wouldn't be caught dead red #
# 'Cause if you are seen green #
# It means you've got mean bread #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen in green to show that your stuff's laid #
- # If you're not seen green #
# You'd better be wearin' jade #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen green #
# Don't tell him your cupboard's bare #
# That you gave up one week's feed #
# To pay for your colored hair #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Oz.
I thought it over and green is dead.
'Til I change my mind, the color's red.
# I wouldn't be seen green #
# Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ah, ah #
# I wouldn't be caught dead #
# And if I'm caught at all #
# Then catch me in dead red #
# Ooo #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to be real hot #
# So throw away those green gems #
# And wear rubies on your yacht #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to have flash and flair #
# And if you're not seen red #
# Then you shouldn't be seen #
# Nowhere #
How quick fashion goes down the drain.
Last week when you all was wearin' pink...
...already for me, red was old.
The ultimate yellow brick is gold.
That's the new color, children, hit it.
# Golden gold #
# You've got to be seen gold #
# Watch out for the new kind you've got to have old gold #
# Like some from a gold mine
You've got to be wearin' gold #
# The 24 karat kind and once you've shined it up #
# It should ought to make you blind #
# You've got to be seen in gold to show you're super slick #
# It helps to pay tips and tolls
It's the ultimate yellow brick #
# It's the ultimate #
# Gold #
# Gold, gold #
# Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold ##
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Send up the one with the silver slippers.
Do you know how lucky you are?
I've been trying to get an appointment for two years!
No one sees the Wiz!
- I knew you'd make it.
- Who does your hair?
Can you come for dinner next Wednesday?
- Can I give you my card?
- Can I take you home?
And...
Only the one with the silver slippers!
You go ahead, Dorothy.
"He who hesitates... "
Etcetera, etcetera.
Uh, I'd like to speak to the Wiz.
Hey, Mike!
Excuse me...
Excuse me, sir, Mr. Wiz?
Speak!
I'm not alone, sir. I'm here with my three companions and my dog, Toto.
Forget it.
No riffraff.
Uh, they're not riffraff, sir.
They're my friends and they've traveled far to see you.
I said, forget it!
Then, then, I'm not comin' up there.
What?
Either you see my friends, sir, or you forget it.
Send up the riffraff.
I don't think there's any choice.
Dorothy, you don't have to do it!
We could stay right here!
The Emerald City's not a bad place.
Get a small apartment, chip in together.
Hey, I bet in no time we'd fit right in.
But I could never be happy here.
Besides, I'd... Never get home.
I have to go all the way, even if it means to Evillene.
Come on, Toto, good boy.
Then I'm going with you.
Likewise!
Me too.
Come on.
Which road do we take?
Road? This one...
...and you may be sorry.
- Then how do we find Evillene?
- Don't worry.
She'll find you.
Owww!

Work! Work! Work! Work!
Work, work, work, work!
And...
...all lunch hours are cancelled!
Oh, please, O beautiful one!
We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!
Well, suffering is food for the soul.
Now suffer!
So, no one stopped Dorothy, eh?
All right!
Amateur night is over!
I'm summoning my flying monkeys!
No, no, not the flying monkeys!
Yes, yes, the flying monkeys!
I hate to have to do this myself, because I can't stand the smells...
...but these are red alert conditions!
Hot... Fire.
Peee-uu! Aaah!
- What's happenin'?
- Don't come any closer!
I got a little job for you, Cheetah.
Bring me Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Lion and the dog too.
How do you want 'em?
White bread or rye?
You get smart with me and I'll send you back to your cages!
Now get Dorothy and don't damage those silver slippers!
Peee-uu!
War is hell!
Hit it, Morris!
# Don't nobody bring me
Don't nobody bring me #
# Don't nobody bring me no bad news ##
# Ease on down #
I ain't scared.
Aaah!
- Hey, brother!
- Not now!
Lion! Wait for me!
Get back, I told you!
Psst! Psst! Psst!
Psst!
Psst, psst, psst!
We're over here!
- Psst! Lion!
- Psst!
Hey, brother!
You better get outta the way for me!
Toto! Where's Toto?
Toto! Oh!
Toto!
- Toto! Toto!
- Hey, there he is.
- Toto.
- I think we're safe.
So, you're Dorothy, huh?
You murdered my sister!
A saint she was.
And stole her shoes!
- Give them to me!
- No.
- What?
- No!
All right, you!
Don't worry, Dorothy.
It doesn't hurt.
It's just a little rough on my filing system.
Never fear, my little flower.
I'm just a hollow shell!
Don't give up the shoes!
Would you like sauerkraut or mustard, my dear?
On your hot dog!
Toto! Toto! No! Don't!
No, don't!
Don't you dare! Toto, Toto!
- Will you give me those shoes?
- Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I thought.
Toto.
Psst! Psst!
Hurry up with those shoes!
No! Don't touch that! No!
- No! No!
- Toto!
I'm allergic to water!
It makes me melt! No! No!
Please, please, help me with my friends!
Oh, no!
Here it is, I got 'em!
Oh, put him together.
I don't care what you do.
Just put him down.
Put him together.
Where's his arm?
His arm, oh!
Okay, okay, do something!
Get some tools, get something!
A crowbar, a hammer!
Don't hurt him!

Whee!
Hello?
- Where are we?
- This must be the back door.
I don't think the killers of the Wicked Witch of the West...
...should be using the back door.
You know what I mean?
Cheetah says it's a shortcut.
- Good-bye, Cheetah.
- Good-bye, Dorothy.
Bye. Whew!
It's open.
Hello? Hello in there!
Wait!
- Wait a minute.
- Does this look familiar?
Guess who got had?
Barnum said there's a sucker born every minute.
I was there when he said it...
...but I never thought
I'd be one of 'em.
Phony!
You're nothing but a phony!
The Wizard's out!
He's not here!
Lies! No more lies.
You charlatan!
I've seen men shot for less.
- You're a terrible man!
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Phony!
Everything they say about me is true.
I'm a phony!
I got no right to be pretending to be the Wiz!
I've got nothin'.
Hocus-pocus.
I'm just plain old Herman Smith from Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
Atlantic City?
You mean, you're from New Jersey?
Mm-hmm.
I'm just a second-rate politician from District Seven.
"Public office is the last refuge of the incompetent. " Penrose!
Incompetent?
Ha-ha-ha!
That's me.
I'm incompetent.
So much so, I could never get elected to public office.
Not because I didn't try.
I tried everything.
Look, look!
I ran for everything.
Alderman, councilman, assembly leader!
I became a laughingstock.
I couldn't even get on the ticket!
Finally, in desperation,
I ran for dogcatcher!
I like animals.
Don't get me wrong.
I was at the end of my rope.
I plunged myself into the campaign.
One desperate grandstand play.
You know what I did?
I rented a hot-air balloon!
Hot air!
That's a perfect vehicle for you.
No, no, no!
It was a beautiful
Fourth of July day!
I planned to fly over the boardwalk and the beach...
...and throw my...
Aaah!
Throw my leaflets to the astonished crowds below.
My motto was...
"Vote for Smith, your best bet to catch that pet. "
But just when I got up in the balloon...
A terrible storm came up...
...and blew me into the clouds.
I got lost.
I landed here in Oz.
They'd never seen a hot-air balloon like mine before.
And I know I should have told them the truth...
...but they proclaimed me the Wizard...
...and I needed the job.
And you mean...
...you sent us to kill Evillene...
...knowing... we might never come back?
She would've killed me.
She would've found out
I had no power, and took over Oz.
That's no excuse.
Come on.
Please, please don't go.
I live...
I live here all alone...
...in terror...
...that someone will find out...
...that I'm a fraud.
Please...
...just stay with me for a little while and talk.
You can talk to me crazy...
...call me names.
What's the matter?
Now I'll never get my brain.
Nor my heart.
Or my courage.
But you don't need them now...
...because you've had them all along.
Scarecrow. Scarecrow?
You're the one who figured out how to find the Yellow Brick Road...
...and how to destroy Evillene...
...and every smart move we've made.
Didn't you?
And, Lion...
...you wouldn't even give up when
Evillene strung you up by your tail.
And, Tin Man...
...you have more heart than anyone I've ever known.
Honest?
Yes.
You never needed anything from the fake Wizard anyway.

What about you, Dorothy?
You'll never get home.
Me?
I guess you're stuck with Toto and me.
It's Glinda, the Good Witch of the South!
She has great powers.
Hello, Dorothy.
Please, is there a way for me to get home?
Dorothy, you were wise and good enough...
...to help your friends find what was inside them all the time.
That's true for you, also.
Home?
Inside me?
I don't understand.
Home is a place we all must find, child.
It's not just a place where you eat or sleep.
Home is knowing.
Knowing your mind, knowing your heart...
...knowing your courage.
If we know ourselves, we're always home, anywhere.
# If you believe #
# Within your heart you'll know #
# That no one can change #
# The path that you must go #
# Believe what you feel #
# And know you're right because #
# The time will come around #
# When you'll say it's yours #
# Believe that you can go home #
# Believe you can float on air #
# Yes, click your heels three times #
# If you believe #
# And then you'll be there #
# That's why I want you to believe in yourself #
# Yes, right from the start #
# You've got to believe #
# Believe in the magic right there in your heart #
# Go ahead believe all these things #
# Not because
I told you to #
# Now, go ahead and believe #
# Believe in yourself #
# Ooh, yeah, believe #
# Believe in yourself
Ooh, yeah #
# Yeah, yeah believe in yourself #
# As I believe in you ##
You mean,
I could have gone home...
...by clicking my heels three times?
Uh-huh.
Dorothy.
Can you do something for me?
They've had what they've been searching for in them all along.
I don't know what's in you.
You'll have to find that out for yourself.
But I do know one thing.
You'll never find it in the safety of this room.
I tried that all my life.
It doesn't work.
There's a whole world out there.
And you'll have to begin...
...by letting people see who you really are.
Success...
...fame and fortune...
...they're all illusions.
All there is that is real...
...is the friendship...
...that two can share.
That's beautiful.
Who said that?
I did.
Oh, Dorothy.
I'll think of you all the time.
And I will miss you...
...every day.
Even if I had to go back to that junk pile...
...even as Teenie's seat cushion,
I wouldn't mind...
...because I have known real love.
Oh, don't rust yourself, now.
Oh, Dorothy.
If it hadn't been for you...
I'd still be back on that pedestal...
...afraid to live.
Me, too.
Thank you.
Thank you for being my friends.
I'm ready now.
Think of home.
Home.
# When I think of home #
# I think of a place #
# Where there's love overflowin' #
# I wish I was home #
# I wish I was back there #
# With the things
I've been knowin' #
# Wind that makes the tall trees #
# Bend into leaning #
# Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning #
# Sprinkling the scene #
# Makes it all clean #
# Maybe there's a chance for me to go back #
# Now that I have some direction #
# It would sure be nice to be back home #
# Where there's love and affection #
# And just maybe I can convince time to slow up #
# Givin' me enough time in my life to grow up #
# Time, be my friend #
# Let me start again #
# Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face #
# But I still know where I'm goin' #
# I have had my mind spun around in space #
# And yet I've watched it growin' #
# And if you're listenin', God #
# Please don't make it hard #
# To know if we should believe the things that we see #
# Tell us should we run away #
# Should we try and stay #
# Or would it be better just to let things be #
# Livin' here in this brand-new world #
# Might be a fantasy #
# But it taught me to love #
# So it's real real to me #
# And I've learned #
# That we must look inside our hearts #
# To find #
# A world full of love #
# Like yours, like mine #
# Like home ##

Whoa, there!
Halt!
Who goes there? lt is l, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons.
Sovereign of all England!
Pull the other one. l am, and this my trusty servant, Patsy.
We have ridden the length of the land in search of knights...
...who will join me in my court at Camelot. l must speak with your lord and master.
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.
-You're using coconuts!
-What?
You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're banging them together.
So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land.
-Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
-Where did you get the coconuts?
We found them.
Found them? ln Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.
-What do you mean?
-Well, this is a temperate zone.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover...
...may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
-Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
-Not at all. They could be carried.
-What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
-lt could grip it by the husk. lt's not a question of where he grips it. lt's a simple question of weight ratio.
A 5-ounce bird could not carry a 1-pound coconut. lt doesn't matter. Go tell your master that Arthur from Camelot is here. ln order to maintain air-speed velocity...
...a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?
-Please!
-Am l right?
-l'm not interested.
-lt could be carried by an African swallow.
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That's my point. l agree with that.
Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?
But then, of course,
African swallows are non-migratory.
-Oh, yes.
-They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway.
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?
-No, they'd have to have it on a line.
-Simple. They'd use a strand of creeper.
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?
Bring out your dead!
Ninepence.
-Bring out your dead.
-Here's one.
Ninepence.
-l'm not dead!
-What?
-Nothing. There's your ninepence.
-l'm not dead!
-He says he's not dead.
-Yes, he is.
-l'm not!
-He isn't.
-He will be soon. He's very ill.
-l'm getting better!
You'll be stone dead in a moment. l can't take him like that. lt's against regulations.
-l don't want to go on the cart.
-Don't be such a baby.
-l can't take him.
-l feel fine.
-Well, do us a favour.
-l can't.
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won't be long.
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.
-When's your next round?
-Thursday.
-l think l'll go for a walk.
-You're not fooling anyone, you know.
-lsn't there something you can do?
-l feel happy.
-Thanks very much.
-Not at all. See you on Thursday.
Right.
-Who's that, then?
-l don't know. Must be a king.
-Why?
-He hasn't got shit all over him.
-Old woman!
-Man!
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle over there?
-l'm 37.
-What?
-l'm 37. l'm not old.
-l can't just call you ''man.''
-You could say, ''Dennis.''
-l didn't know you were a Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out. l did say sorry about the ''old woman,'' but from behind--
What l object to is that you treat me like an inferior.
-Well, l am king.
-King? Very nice.
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!
By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates...
...the economic and social differences in our society!
-lf there's ever going to be any progress--
-There's some lovely filth down here.
How do you do?
How do you do, good lady? l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?
We all are. We're all Britons.
And l am your king.
Didn't know we had a king.
We're an autonomous collective.
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.
A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class--
There you go. Bringing class into it again.
-That's what it's all about. lf only people--
-Please, good people. l am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?
-No one lives there.
-Who is your lord?
-We don't have a lord.
-What? l told you.
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
We take turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
-Yes.
-But all the decisions of that officer...
-...are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
-Yes, l see.
-By majority in the case of internal affairs.
-Be quiet!
-By a two-thirds majority in the case of--
-Be quiet! l order you to be quiet.
''Order.'' Who does he think he is?
-l am your king!
-l didn't vote for you.
-You don't vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite...
...held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water...
...signifying, by divine providence, that l, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
That is why l'm your king!
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds, distributing swords, is no basis...
...for a system of government.
Supreme executive power...
...derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Be quiet!
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power...
...'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.
-Shut up!
-lf l went around saying l was an emperor...
...because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!
-Will you shut up?
-See the violence inherent in the system.
-Shut up!
-See the violence inherent in the system!
-Help, l'm being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!
What a give away. Did you hear that?
That's what l'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight. l am Arthur, King of the Britons. l seek the finest and bravest knights in the land to join me in Camelot.
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.
None shall pass.
-What?
-None shall pass. l have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but l must cross this bridge.
Then you shall die. l command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside. l move for no man.
So be it!
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.
-'Tis but a scratch.
-''A scratch''? Your arm's off.
-No, it isn't.
-Well, what's that, then?
-l've had worse.
-You liar.
Come on, you pansy!
Victory is mine.
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy--
-Come on, then.
-What?
Have at you.
You are brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is mine.
Had enough, eh?
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.
-Yes, l have.
-Look!
Just a flesh wound.
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken! l'll have your leg. Right!
-Right! l'll do you for that.
-You'll what?
-Come here.
-What are you going to do? Bleed on me?
-l am invincible!
-You're a loony.
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!
Come on, then.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, l see.
Running away? You yellow bastard!
Come back here and take what's coming to you! l'll bite your legs off!

-A witch!
-We found a witch.
-We got a witch.
-We found a witch.
We've got a witch.
Burn her!
-We have found a witch. May we burn her?
-Burn her!
-How do you know she is a witch?
-She looks like one.
Bring her forward.
-l am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn't!
And this isn't my nose. lt's a false one.
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.
-The nose?
-And the hat. But she is a witch.
Burn her!
-Did you dress her up like this?
-No. Yes.
Yes, a bit. She has got a wart.
-What makes you think she is a witch?
-Well, she turned me into a newt.
A newt? l got better.
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!
Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
-Are there? What are they? Tell us.
-Do they hurt?
Tell me: What do you do with witches?
Burn them!
-What do you burn apart from witches?
-More witches!
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?
-'Cause they're made of wood?
-Good.
So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
-Build a bridge out of her.
-Can you not also make bridges of stone?
Oh, yeah.
Does wood sink in water?
-No.
-lt floats.
Throw her into the pond!
-What also floats in water?
-Bread.
-Apples.
-Very small rocks.
-Cider. Gravy. Cherries.
-Nuts.
-Churches.
-Lead.
A duck!
Exactly.
So, logically.... lf she...
...weighs the same as a duck...
...she's made of wood.
And, therefore....
-A witch!
-A witch!
We shall use my largest scales.
Right. Remove the supports!
-lt's a fair cop.
-Burn her!
Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?
-l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-My liege.
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table?
My liege, l would be honoured.
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.
Then l dub you, Sir Bedevere...
...knight of the Round Table.
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights.
But other illustrious names were soon to follow.
Sir Lancelot the Brave.
Sir Galahad the Pure.
And Sir Robin, the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot...
...who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor...
...who nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol...
...and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill.
And the aptly named
Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
Together they formed a band...
...whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries.
The Knights of the Round Table.
That, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
This new learning amazes me,
Sir Bedevere.
Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
-Certainly, sir.
-Look, my liege.
-Camelot.
-Camelot.
-Camelot.
-lt's only a model.
Knights, l bid you welcome to your new home.
Let us ride to Camelot!
''We're knights of the Round Table
We dance whene'er we're able
''We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable
''We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot
''We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable
''But many times
We're given rhymes
''That are quite unsingable
We're opera mad in Camelot
''We sing from the diaphragm a lot
''ln war we're tough and able
''Quite indefatigable
''Between our quests
We sequin vests
''And impersonate Clark Gable lt's a busy life in Camelot
''l have to push the pram a lot''
No, on second thoughts, let's not go to Camelot. lt is a silly place.
Right.
Arthur.
King of the Britons.
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people grovelling.
-Sorry.
-And don't apologize.
Every time I talk to someone it's
''sorry this,'' and, ''forgive me that''...
...and, ''I'm not worthy.''
-What are you doing now?
-l'm averting my eyes, O Lord.
Don't. It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.
-Now, knock it off!
-Yes, Lord.
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.
Your knights of the Round Table shall have a task...
...to make them an example in these dark times.
-Good idea, O Lord!
-'Course it's a good idea.
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.
Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.
That is your purpose, Arthur.
The quest for the Holy Grail.
-A blessing from the Lord.
-God be praised!
Halt!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello. Who is it? lt is King Arthur, and these are my knights of the Round Table.
Whose castle is this?
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God...
...with a sacred quest. lf he will give us food and shelter for the night...
...he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, l'll ask him, but l don't think he'll be very keen.
He's already got one, you see.
-What?
-He says they've already got one!
-Are you sure he's got one?
-Oh, yes. lt's very nice. l told him we've already got one.
-Can we come up, and have a look?
-Of course not! You are English-types.
-Well, what are you then?
-l'm French.
Why do you think l have this outrageous accent, you silly king?
-What are you doing in England?
-Mind your own business. lf you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force.
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!
Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person. l blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King.
You and all your silly English knights.
-What a strange person.
-Now look here, my good man-- l don't want to talk to you no more...
...you empty-headed, animal food-trough wiper. l fart in your general direction.
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries. ls there someone else up there we could talk to?
No. Now go away, or l shall taunt you a second time.
Now, this is your last chance. l've been more than reasonable....
-Fetchez la vache!
-Quoi?
Fetchez la vache! lf you do not agree to my commands, then l shall--
Jesus Christ!
Right! Charge!
Run away! Run away!
-Fiends! l'll tear them apart.
-No, no.
Sir, l have a plan, sir.
-Un cadeau.
-What?
-A present.
-Un cadeau.
Oui, allons-y. Let's go.
What happens now?
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad, and l wait until nightfall...
...and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise.
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
Who leaps out?
Lancelot, Galahad, and l...
...leap out of the rabbit.
Look. lf we built this large, wooden badger....
Run away!
-History for Schools. Take 8.
-Action!
Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.
The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise.
Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required...
...if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.
Arthur, having consulted his closest knights...
...decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually.
Now, this is what they did--
Frank!
The tale of Sir Robin.
So, each of the knights went their separate ways.
Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing...
...accompanied by his favourite minstrels.
''Bravely bold Sir Robin
Rode forth from Camelot
''He was not afraid to die
O, Brave Sir Robin
''He was not at all afraid
To be killed in nasty ways
''Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin
''He was not in the least bit scared
To be mashed into a pulp
''Or to have his eyes gouged out
And his elbows broken
''To have his kneecaps split
And his body burned away
''And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin
''His head smashed in
And his heart cut out
''His liver removed
And his bowels unplugged
''His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off
And his penis--''
That's enough music for now, lads.
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
Dennis, forget about freedom.
Don't drop that mud.
Halt! Who art thou?
-''He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin--''
-Shut up!
Nobody, really. l was just passing through.
What do you want?
-''To fight and--''
-Shut up!
Nothing. Nothing, really.
-Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
-I'm afraid not.
-Actually, l am a knight of the Round Table.
-You're a knight of the Round Table? l am.
-In that case, I have to kill you.
-Shall I?
-I don't think so.
-What do I think?
-Kill him.
-Let's be nice to him.
-Shut up.
-But--
And you!
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!
-Cut your own head off.
-Yes, do us all a favour.
-What?
-Yapping on all the time.
-You're lucky you're not next to him.
-What do you mean?
-You snore.
-I don't.
-You've got bad breath.
-Only because you don't brush my teeth.
Stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!
All right! We'll kill him first, and then have tea and biscuits.
-Yes.
-Not biscuits.
All right! Not biscuits.
But let's kill him anyway.
Right.
-He's buggered off!
-So he has! He's scarpered.
-''Brave Sir Robin ran away''
-No!
-''Bravely ran away, away''
-l didn't.
''When danger reared its ugly head
He bravely turned his tail and fled
''Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
And gallantly he chickened out
''Bravely taking to his feet
He beat a very brave retreat
-''Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin''
-l never!

The tale of Sir Galahad.
Open the door. ln the name of King Arthur, open the door!
Hello!
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
-The Castle Anthrax?
-Yes. lt's not a very good name, is it?
But we are nice, and we will attend to your every, every need!
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
-The what?
-The Grail. lt is here?
But you are tired, and you must rest awhile.
Midget! Crapper!
-Yes, O Zoot?
-Prepare a bed for our guest.
-Thank you, Zoot.
-Thank you.
Away, away, varletesses!
The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.
-Look, l--
-What is your name, handsome knight?
Sir Galahad the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.
-But come.
-Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.
You have suffered much. You are delirious.
-Look, l have seen it. lt is here.
-Sir Galahad!
You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality. l'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet, compared to yours.
We're 8 score blondes and brunettes, all between 16 and 19 and a half...
...cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us. lt is a lonely life.
Bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.
We are just not used to handsome knights.
Nay. Come. You may lie here.
-But you are wounded!
-No, it's nothing!
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.
-Well, what seems to be the trouble?
-They're doctors?
They have a basic medical training.
Come, come, you must try to rest.
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.
-Try to relax.
-Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?
We must examine you.
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-Please. We are doctors.
Look, this cannot be.
-l am sworn to chastity!
-Back to your bed!
Torment me no longer. l have seen the Grail.
-There's no Grail here.
-l have seen it.
-l have seen--
-Hello.
Hello.
-Zoot!
-l am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
-Where are you going?
-l seek the Grail. l have seen it here in this castle!
Oh, no. Bad, bad Zoot!
-What is it?
-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!
She has been setting light to our beacon, which is Grail-shaped. lt's not the first time we've had this problem. lt's not the real Grail?
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.
She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty.
Do you think this scene should have been cut?
We were so worried when the boys were writing it.
But now we're glad. lt's better than some previous scenes, l think.
Ours was better visually.
Ours was committed. lt wasn't a string of pussy jokes.
-Get on with it.
-Yes. Get on with it!
Get on with it!
-l am enjoying this scene.
-Get on with it!
Wicked, wicked Zoot!
She must pay the penalty. ln Castle Anthrax, we have a punishment for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.
You must tie her down on a bed, and spank her.
A spanking! A spanking!
You must spank her, and after you've spanked her, deal with her as you like.
-And, then, spank me.
-And me!
-And me.
-And me.
Yes. You must give us all a good spanking!
A spanking!
-And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
-The oral sex!
Well, l could stay a bit longer.
-Sir Galahad!
-Hello.
-Quick! You are in great peril.
-Why?
-No, he isn't!
-Silence, foul temptress!
-She's got a point.
-We'll cover your escape!
-Look, l'm fine!
-Wait, Sir Galahad!
-l can tackle this lot single-handed!
-Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!
No, Sir Galahad. Come!
Honestly, l can handle this lot easily!
-Yes, let him handle us easily.
-No, sir. Quick!
Wait! Please! l can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!
He'll beat us easily. We haven't a chance.
Oh, shit!
-You were in great peril.
-l don't think l was.
You were in terrible peril.
-Let me go back, and face the peril.
-No, it's too perilous. lt's my duty to sample as much peril as l can.
We've got to find the Holy Grail.
-Let me have just a bit of peril?
-No. lt's unhealthy.
-l bet you're gay.
-No, l'm not.
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation.
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away...
...had discovered something.
That's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.
They were more than two laden swallow's flights away.
Four, with a coconut on a line between them.
If the birds were--
Get on with it!
Oh, anyway...
...on to Scene 24, which is a smashing scene, with some lovely acting...
...in which Arthur discovers a vital clue.
There aren't any swallows, but I think you can hear a--
And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?
Where does he live?
Old man, where does he live?
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.
-And the Grail. The Grail is there?
-There is much danger.
For beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...
...which no man has ever crossed.
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?
Seek you the Bridge of Death.
The Bridge of Death?
Which leads to the Grail?
-Who are you?
-We are the knights who say, ''Ni''!
-No! Not the knights who say ''Ni''?
-The same!
-Who are they?
-We are the keepers of the sacred words.
''Ni,'' ''Peng,'' and ''Neee Wom''!
Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.
The knights who say, ''Ni'' demand a sacrifice.
Knights of Ni, we are but simple travellers...
...who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
Ni! Ni!
We shall say, ''Ni'' again to you, if you do not appease us.
-What is it you want?
-We want...
...a shrubbery.
A what?
-Ni! Ni!
-Please! No more!
-We will find you a shrubbery.
-You must return with a shrubbery...
...or else you will never pass through this wood...
...alive.
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.
-We will return with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.
-Yes.
-Now go!
Stop that! Stop that!
Go on, be off! Go away.
And you, be off!
Bloody weather.
The tale of Sir Lancelot.
One day, lad, all this will be yours.
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains.
All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys.
That'll be your kingdom, lad.
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad.
-But, Father, l don't want any of that.
-Listen, lad. l built this kingdom up from nothing.
When l started here, it was a swamp.
Other kings said l was daft to build a castle on the swamp.
But l built it all the same to show them. lt sank into the swamp.
So, l built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.
So, l built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank in the swamp.
But the fourth one stayed up.
And that's what you'll get, lad.
-The strongest castle in these isles.
-But l don't want any of that.
-l'd rather--
-Rather what? l'd rather just...
-...sing.
-Stop that.
You're not going into a song while l'm here! ln 20 minutes, you're marrying a girl...
...whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.
-But l don't want land.
-Listen, Alice.
-Herbert.
-Herbert.
We live on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
-But l don't like her.
-Don't like her?
What's wrong with her?
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...
...tracts of land. l know, but l want the girl that l marry to have...
...a certain special something.
Cut that out!
You're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!
Guards!
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave the room until l get him.
Not to leave the room, even if you come and get him.
No. Until l come and get him.
Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
No, you stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
-And you'll come and get him.
-Right.
We don't need to do anything, apart from stop him entering the room.
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.
-All right?
-lf....
-lf we're--
-Yes?
Look, it's quite simple.
You stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
-All right?
-l remember.
Can he can he leave the room with us?
No, you just keep him in here, and make sure--
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.
-But if he had to leave--
-No. Keep him in here!
-Until you, or anyone--
-Not anyone, just me.
-Just you....
-Get back.
-Right?
-Right.
We'll stay here until you get back.
-And make sure he doesn't leave.
-What?
-Make sure he doesn't leave.
-The Prince?
-Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
-Yes, of course! l thought you meant him! lt seemed a bit daft me having to guard him when he's a guard.
-ls that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.
Right.
-Where are you going?
-We're coming with you. l want you to stay here, and make sure he doesn't leave. l see, right.
-But, Father--
-Shut it, and get that suit on.
And no singing!
Go and get a glass of water.
-Well taken, Concorde!
-Thank you, sir, most kind.
And again!
Over we go! Good, steady!
Now, the big one!
Come on, Concorde!
Message for you, sir.
Concorde, speak to me!
''To whoever finds this note...
''...l have been imprisoned by my father...
''...who wishes me to marry against my will.
''Please, please come and rescue me.
''l am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.''
At last! A call! A cry of distress!
This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!
Brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain! l'm not quite dead, sir.
You shall not have been mortally wounded in vain! l think l could pull through, sir.
-l see.
-l think l'm all right to come with you.
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here. l will send help as soon as l have accomplished a daring and...
...heroic rescue in my own particular....
-ldiom, sir?
-ldiom!
-No, l feel fine, actually, sir.
-Farewell, sweet Concorde! l'll just stay here, shall l, sir?
Yeah.
Hey!
You're not allowed to enter the room--
Fair one, behold your servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
-l have come to take.... l'm terribly sorry.
-You got my note!
-l got a note.
-You've come to rescue me?
-Well, no, you see--
-l knew someone would. l knew that somewhere out there, there must be someone--
Stop that! Stop it!
Who are you?
-l'm your son.
-No, not you.
-l'm Sir Lancelot, sir.
-He's come to rescue me, Father.
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-Did you kill all those guards?
Yes. Sorry.
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-l'm awfully sorry.
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot. l've got a rope ready.
You killed eight wedding guests and all!
Well, you see, l thought your son was a lady. l can understand that.
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
-Shut up!
-You only killed the bride's father!
-l didn't mean to.
Didn't mean to?
You put your sword through his head!
-Oh dear, is he all right?
-You kicked the bride in the chest!
-lt's going to cost me a fortune!
-l can explain. l was in the forest, riding north from Camelot when l got this note.
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! l'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.
-ls it?
-l am ready!
-Would you like to come have a drink?
-That's awfully nice of you.
-l am ready!
-l mean, to be so understanding.
You see, when l'm in this idiom, l sometimes get a bit carried away.
Now, this is the main hall.
We'll have all this knocked through--
-There he is!
-Bloody hell.
-Hold it, please!
-See what l mean? l get carried away. l'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.
He's killed the best man!
Hold it, please, hold it.
This is Sir Lancelot...
...from the Court of Camelot, a brave and influential knight.
-And my special guest here today.
-Hello.
He killed my auntie!
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.
We are here today to witness the union of two young people...
...in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.
Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert...
...has just fallen to his death.
But l don't want to think l've lost a son, so much as...
...gained a daughter.
For, since the tragic death of her father--
He's not quite dead!
Since the near fatal wounding of her father--
He's getting better!
For, since her own father...
...who, when he seemed about to recover...
...suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.
He's died! l want his only daughter to look upon me...
...as her own dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense.
And l feel sure that the merger....
The union between the Princess...
...and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--
-What?
-Look, the dead Prince!
-He's not quite dead!
-l feel much better.
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!
-No, l was saved at the last minute.
-How? l'll tell you.
Not like that! Not like that.
''He's going tell
He's going to tell''
Quickly, sir, come this way!
No, it's not right for my idiom. l must escape more....
-Dramatically, sir?
-Dramatically.
Excuse me, could somebody give me a push, please?
Old crone! ls there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?
-Who sent you?
-The knights who say, ''Ni''!
No! We have no shrubberies here. lf you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and l...
...will say....
We will say, ''Ni.''
Do your worst!
Very well. lf you will not assist us voluntarily...
-...Ni!
-No!
Never. No shrubberies.
-Ni!
-Noo!
No, it's not that, it's ''Ni.''
No, you're not doing it properly.
-Ni.
-You've got it.
-Ni!
-Ni!
Are you saying ''Ni'' to that old woman?
Yes.
What sad times are these when passing ruffians can say, ''Ni'' at will to old ladies.
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.
Even those who arrange shrubberies are under considerable economic stress...
...at this period in history.
-Did you say ''shrubberies''?
-Yes.
Shrubberies are my trade. l am a shrubber.
My name is Roger the Shrubber. l arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
-Ni!
-No!
Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.
-May we go?
-lt is a good shrubbery. l like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.
What is that?
We are now no longer the knights who say ''Ni.''
We are now the knights who say:
''Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing''!
Therefore, we must give you a test.
What's is this test, knights who until recently said ''Ni''?
Firstly, you must find...
...another shrubbery!
Not another shrubbery!
Then you must bring it here beside this shrubbery.
Higher, so you get the two-level effect, a path going down the middle.
A path! A path!
Then, when you have found the shrubberies...
...you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...
...with a herring!
-We shall do no such thing.
-Please.
Cut down a tree with a herring? lt can't be done.
-Don't say that word.
-What word? l cannot tell. Suffice to say...
...it's one of the words the knights of Ni cannot hear.
How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
-He did it again.
-What? ''ls''?
You wouldn't get very far in life not saying ''is.''
My liege, it's Robin.
''He's jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up
''And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge''
-Robin.
-My liege. lt's good to see you.
You haven't given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
-''He is sneaking away and--''
-Shut up!
-No, far from it.
-You said the word again. l was looking for it here in this forest.
-No, it is far from this place.
-Stop saying the word!
-The word we cannot hear!
-Stop it!
-He said, ''it'' again!
-That's it! l've said, ''it.'' l've said, ''it.'' l've said, ''it'' again!
That's three ''its''!
And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find...
...the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in Scene 24.
Beyond the forest they met Lancelot and Galahad...
...and there was much rejoicing.
In the frozen land of Nador...
...they were forced to eat
Robin's minstrels.
And there was much rejoicing.
A year passed.
Winter changed into spring.
Spring changed into summer.
Summer changed back into winter...
...and winter gave spring and summer a miss and went straight on into autumn.
Until one day.
Knights...
...forward!
What manner of man are you, that can summon up fire...
-...without flint or tinder?
-l am an enchanter.
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...
-...Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the enchanter!
Greetings, King Arthur.
-You know my name?
-l do.
You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.
Quite.
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.
-Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
-Yes, it is.
-And so we're looking for it.
-Yes, we are.
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.
So, anything you could do to help would be...
...very...
-...helpful.
-Look, can you tell us where--
Fine, l don't want to waste any more of your time...
...but l don't suppose you could tell us where we might find a....
A what?
A grail?
Yes, l think so.
Yes.
Yes!
-Thank you.
-Splendid!
Look, you're a busy man--
Yes, l can help you find the Holy Grail.
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.
Wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock...
...the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...
...make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
-Where could we find this cave, Tim?
-Follow!
But follow only if ye be men of valour.
For the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature...
...so foul, so cruel...
...that no man yet has fought with it and lived.
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn about its lair. So, brave knights...
...if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further...
...for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.
What an eccentric performance!
They're nervous, sire.
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on, on foot.
Dismount!
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.
There he is!
-Where?
-There.
-What, behind the rabbit?
-lt is the rabbit.
-You silly sod!
-What?
You got us all worked up.
That's no ordinary rabbit.
That's the most foul, cruel and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.
You tit! l soiled my armour l was so scared!
Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide.
-lt's a killer!
-Get stuffed.
-He'll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?
-You manky Scots git!
-l'm warning you.
-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
-He's got huge, sharp.... lt can leap about....
-Look at the bones!
-Go on, Bors, chop its head off.
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.
Look!
-Jesus Christ!
-l warned you!
-l've done it again.
-l warned you.
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you? lt's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same.
-l always--
-Shut up!
Charge!
Run away!
-How many did we lose?
-Gawain.
-Ector.
-And Bors. That's five.
-Three.
-Three.
We better not risk another frontal assault, that rabbit's dynamite.
Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
-Shut up and change your armour.
-Let us taunt it. lt may become so cross, that it will make a mistake.
Like what?
Well....
-Have we got bows?
-No.
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. lt's one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries.
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.
How does it....
How does it work?
-l know not, my liege.
-Consult the Book of Armaments.
Armaments 2: 9-21.
''And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying:
'''O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayest...
'''...blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'
''And the Lord did grin and the people did feast upon...
''...the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans...
''...and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and--''
Skip a bit, Brother.
''The Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin...
'''...then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.
'''Three shalt be the number thou shalt count...
'''...and the number of the counting shalt be three.
'''Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two...
'''...excepting that thou then proceed to three.
'''Five is right out.
'''Once the number three, being the third number be reached...
'''...then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch...
'''...towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight...
'''...shall snuff it.'''
Amen.
Amen.
Right.
One, two, five!
-Three, sir!
-Three!
There! Look!
What does it say? What language is that?
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar. lt is Aramaic!
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!
-Of course.
-What does it say? lt reads, ''Here may be found...
''...the last words of Joseph of Arimathea:
'''He who is valiant and pure of spirit...
'''...may find the Holy Grail...
'''...in the Castle of Aaargh.'''
What?
''The Castle of Aaargh.''
What is that?
He must have died while carving it.
-Come on!
-That's what it says.
Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve ''Aaargh.''
-He'd just say it.
-That's what's carved in the rock.
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Shut up!
-Does it say anything else?
-No!
Just ''Aaargh.''
Aaargh.
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?
-Where's that?
-ln France, l think.
-lsn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
-No, that's St. lves.
St. lves.
No, ''Aaargh.'' At the back of the throat.
No, in surprise and alarm!
-You mean a sort of a ''Ah!''
-Yes, that's right.
My God! lt's the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh!
That's it! Run away!
We've lost him.
As the horrendous Black Beast lunged foreard...
...escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless.
When, suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.
The cartoon peril was no more.
The quest for the Holy Grail could continue.
There it is!
-The Bridge of Death.
-Great.
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.
-What's he doing here?
-He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.
He asks each traveller five questions.
-Three questions.
-Three questions.
-He who answers the five questions--
-Three questions.
-Three questions, may cross in safety.
-What if you get a question wrong?
Then you are cast into the gorge of eternal peril.
-Oh, wacko.
-Who's going to answer the questions?
Brave Sir Robin, you go. l've got a great idea:
Why doesn't Lancelot go?
Yes, let me go, my liege. l will take him single-handed.
-l shall make a feint to the northeast....
-Hang on!
-Just answer the five questions--
-Three questions.
Three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray. l understand, my liege.
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.
Stop!
Who would cross the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three.
Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. l'm not afraid.
-What is your name?
-My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
What is your quest?
To seek the Holy Grail.
What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.
Well, thank you very much.
That's easy.
Stop.
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three.
Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. l'm not afraid.
-What is your name?
-Sir Robin of Camelot.
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.
What is the capital of Assyria? l don't know that!
Stop!
-What is your name?
-Sir Galahad of Camelot.
-What is your quest?
-l seek the Grail.
-What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.
No! Yellow!
Stop!
-What is your name?
-lt is Arthur, King of the Britons.
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.
What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow? l don't know that!
How do you know so much about swallows?
You have to know these things when you're a king.
Lancelot!
Lancelot!
Lancelot!
The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.
God be praised.
Almighty God...
...we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed to us the most holy--
Jesus Christ!
Dirty English knights.
Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck.
So, we French fellows outwit you a second time.
How dare you profane this place with your presence? l command you, in the name of the knights of Camelot...
...to open the doors of this sacred castle...
...to which God himself has guided us.
How you English say? l'll unclog my nose in your direction.
Sons of a window-dresser!
So, you think you could out-clever us French folk...
...with your silly knees-bent, running about, advancing behaviour. l wave my private parts at your aunties.
You cheesy lot of second-hand, electric donkey-bottom biters! ln the name of the Lord...
...we demand entrance to this sacred castle!
No chance, English bed-wetting types. l burst my pimples at you, and call your door-opening request a silly thing!
You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms. lf you'll not open this door, we shall take this castle by force! ln the name of God and the glory of our--
Right! That settles it!
Depart at this time, and don't be approaching any more...
...or we fire arrows into your heads, and make castanets out of your testicles.
Walk away, just ignore them.
And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!
And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard...
...nothing yet, dirty English knights!
-We shall attack at once.
-Yes, my liege.
Stand by for attack!
French persons!
Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be avenged. ln the name of God, we shall not stop our fight...
...till each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail...
...returns to those whom God has chosen.
Charge!
Yes, they're the ones, l'm sure.
-Come on.
-Put this man in the van.
-Put him in the van.
-Get a blanket over that one.
Come on, back! Right back!
That's an offensive weapon, that is.
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Pack that in.
THE MASTER AND MARGHERITE
Based on Mikhail Bulhakov novel published in 1966
Why did you stop?
You should crush that beast!
- Do you still believe in devil?
- These are no middle ages.
Who still believe in devil, nowadays?
Pontius Pilatus
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
Even he doesn't know where...
It's Nikolai Maksudov. The Master.
The playwrighter.
Bring in the accused.
Pilatus voice was different,
...but Herod's palace was more or less the same.
Accused, did you incite the people to destroy the temple of Jerusalem?
Good man! Believe me...
How dare you call me a good man?
The accused called me a "good man".
Centurion!
Explain him how he must address the procurator.
You must address the Roman procurator as Hegemon. Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
Please, don't hit me.
Your name?
Yeshua Ha-Nozri.
Do you have a nickname?
Yes, Jesus Christ.
As far as I remember, Sire,
...Jesus was more robust, fatter.
You wouldn't be saying that You resemble him?
Oh, Azazelo...
Is it true that you incited people to destroy the temple of Jerusalem?
Please, believe me good man... er...
Hegemon...
It is evidently a misunderstanding,
...caused by the one who always follows me around with the parchment,
...writing down everything I said.
He does it his own way...
...and what he writes is always wrong.
It's just a misunderstanding,
...but he is a good man.
His name is Mateo Levi.
And what did you really say?
I said that the day will come...
...when the old religion's temple will fall,
...and that the temple of truth will appear in it's place.
I never said that I wanted to destroy any temple, Hegemon,
...believe me.
Only a madman would say such things.
Do you think I'm mad?
No.
You are just a liar.
You speak about the truth, of which you have no notion.
What is truth?
You speak about the truth, of which you have no notion.
What is truth?
Who approved the text?
Now, that little worm will run to the telephone.
Stop the rehearsal!
Pavlov!
Interrupt the rehearsal!
Sorry, Sire, but now it's time for you to take charge.
Hello?
Proletarian Writers' Union?
Rimsky, here, director of the theater.
May I talk to comrade Berlioz?
Yes, this is his office, but he's not in.
I'm replacing him today.
Speak.
My name? Woland.
Professor Woland.
You can speak.
Berlioz authorized me.
But Rimski!
Are you opposed to the truth?
Don't commit an irreparable ideological error...
...and don't postpone the play.
Yes, I'm speaking for Berlioz.
He insists that rehearsals resume. Immediately!
Vagrant, why did you stir up people in the bazaar,
...talking about that truth of yours?
What is truth?
The truth is first of all, that...
...your head aches so badly, that you're having faint hearted thoughts of death,
...and it's even hard for you to look at me.
But your suffering will soon be over.
Your headache will soon go away,
Hegemon.
Well! I see that your headache has gone!
Untie him.
Why do you call all men "good"?
Because all men are good.
It's the first time I hear of it.
- Is this all he is accused of?
- No. There's more.
Do you know Judas Iscariot?
Of course.
- Is he a good man, too?
- Yes naturally.
What have you told him about Caesar and state authority?
I told him that all authority is violence against man,
...and that one day there will be no
Caesars nor emperors.
Man will enter the kingdom of truth and justice,
...where there will be no no need for any authority.
Interrupt the rehearsal.
Why?
Thanks, comrades, the rehearsal is over.
And tonight is the opening, comrade Berlioz?
There will be no opening night.
Wouldn't it be better to remove the play from the repertoire?
No. The author has his rights.
I had already suspended the rehearsal, comrade Berlioz.
I called you right away, but Woland, your V.P.,
...told me "I was enemy of the truth".
Have you gone mad, Rimski?
I just returned from the Atheist Writers' Congress.
My office is locked and I have the key in my pocket.
And I don't have V.P..
If I were you
I'd get my head examined.
Nicolai, I always supported You, but this time it's impossible.
But why? Because Christ isn't like one in the Gospels?
Or does the way authority is talked about, bothers you?
It's just my interpretation.
It would be better for you to remove that part.
But I like it a lot.
Why should I remove it?
Then there won't be an opening night?
Opening night is postponed.
Rehearsals will continue!
Berlioz!
Can you at least explain things to me?
I see You need to get drunk?
Are you unlucky in love?
You have...
...a handkerchief so white..
...it looks like snow.
Is today a holiday?
No, it's Thursday today, a regular day.
Love took us unaware, like assassin coming out of nowhere,
...and it struck both of us.
Like a lightning...
...or a knife strikes.
Don't pay attention to what I said.
I'm little drunk...
...and I am a writer.
Do you like this flower?
I like flowers,
...but the yellow ones remind me of the change of seasons.
I saw you this morning...
...at the tram stop.
Do you see?
What happened at the theater this morning?
Nothing.
These three idiots arrived.
Why did they stop the rehearsals and postpone the opening?
Because the fourth arrived.
How nice.
It's a machine
I inherited from my father.
I like useless things.
"A shadow come from the sea and covered Jerusalem...
...on the 14th day of spring month of Nizan"
The day they condemned Christ.
Do you always write on the walls?
Yes, when I want my ideas to last.
I wrote my first draft for "Pontius Pilatus" on this wall.
This way I have it all in front of me.
I don't have to turn the pages.
Look, there's the third act the most important one.
And up there - the epilogue.
Don't pay no attention to the mess.
Tonight I dreamt of Satan.
- Who?
- Satan.
He looked me straight in the eyes.
How strange, people never look me straight in the eyes.
Except you, Margherite.
And where was your Satan?
Where did you find him?
Here, in Moscow.
I know it was just a dream,
...but it didn't surprise me.
I believe in the irrational,
...in the beneficial power of chaos.
Apparently.
But what are we talking about?
Maybe I've had too much to drink.
Margherite Nikolaievna,
...don't take offense, please,
...but why don't you stay with me tonight?
I will,
...but not tonight.
And you Nikolai,
...could you love me?
All three are dead...
...I have checked their bodies,
...they were cold.
Were they given the drink before being hanged on the posts?
Yes. But he refused to drink.
- Who refused?
- Jesus.
Did he say anything?
He said that he laid no blame.
- No blame on whom?
- That he did not say, Hegemon.
My dear Afrianus,
...I have to tell you that you're the best secret police chief we ever had.
I only follow your instructions,
Hegemon.
Nothing more.
I heard that tonight certain
Judas of Kiriath will be killed.
You spoke too flatteringly of me,
Procurator.
I have no information on planned assassination of Judas.
You deserve the highest praise,
Afrianus.
But tonight Judas will be killed.
Sorry, Hegemon, but I doubt it.
Judas will be watched by my men.
No one can get near him.
And I repeat you, Afrianus, that
Judas will be killed tonight.
I have the authority, and will use it.
Don't you agree, Afrianus?
I understand you perfectly,
Hegemon.
Your orders will be followed,
...and Judas will be killed tonight.
Tomorrow I'll bring you the news of his death.
Where's the dog?
Where it is?
It disappeared!
Do you think it is right time to be looking for the dog?
Is it how you rehearse?
Pavlov, I beg you, to demand more from the actors.
Comrade writer, you worry about the script,
...and I'll worry about the directing and about the dogs.
I consulted the Gospels.
Everything is different.
Maybe we should send him to Yalta?
Remember that time with Dadov?
It worked well with him.
He withdrew his play himself.
Yes, I can get you the tickets,
...but then they'll accuse me of patronage.
Everyone asks me, and refusing is unpleasant but...
Is comrade Berlioz at the Union Management?
Yes.
I was summoned.
Come, Nicolai Maksudov, we'll go together.
Thank You.
May, I?
Nicolai!
Is it true that you've...
- ...withdrawned your play?
- No!
But people are talking...
Come on, you can confess, to me...
...that you've withdrawned
"Pontius Pilatus",
...and accepted a seat in management.
If it only suffice to withdraw a work than all will be in management,
...and there are already too many there.
Yes, maybe you're right.
And you know what? I've been asked...
...to write a novel and they granted me only 20 pages of paper.
Not enough even for a poem.
For me it'd not be a problem
I'm writing on the walls,
...that way I see what I write.
Good morning.
I'm not late on purpose, believe me.
But you only called me half an hour ago.
May I sit down?
What a question, Nicolai Maksudov?
You're always welcome.
But I don't quite understand about the call.
Who called you?
I haven’t moved from here.
It wasn't you?
Than, I don't understand it, either.
You don't have a substitute?
But it's good thing that you came,
...so we can resolve this confusion about "Pontius Pilatus".
What confusion?
The story is quite clear.
I can explain it if you want.
What you wrote is clear?
I'm not saying that it's a bad piece...
Then why should I withdraw it?
You're the President.
You like it - that's it, right?
You're perfectly aware that it can't be performed.
Don't you understand what you state, writing that all authority is violence?
Why? Isn't that true?
Something strange has happened to you, Nicolai.
You know what they say?
"Some texts can only favour our class enemies"
But how the truth could favour the enemy?
I repeat, Nikolai.
Think it over, do as I say.
You must withdraw it spontaneously.
You look tired.
Why don't you go to Yalta for a few months rest.
Me? To Yalta?
If I understand correctly,
...my "Pontius Pilatus" was removed from repertoire.
- No, the rehearsals will continue.
- Eternally?
What you are afraid of,
Berlioz?
There's something
I haven't told you.
I'm married.
It happens.
My husband works for the police.
Nobody's perfect.
There is something else
I didn't tell you.
We didn't meet by chance.
I've been following you for a while.
Why, Margherite?
I've seen you going shopping alone many times,
...going out with the bunch of papers.
Once...
...it was holiday...
...you walked a lot.
There was a great wind.
You were so distracted...
...that I thought...
..."now the wind will take him away".
I liked the way you walked.
Like...
Like if you've just woken up.
I knew there were a lot of beautiful things left in my life to discover...
...but I would never have seen them on my own.
And you, why?
Maybe because of the solitude in your eyes.
Margherite, it would be better if you didn't love me.
Do you really think that all men are good?
I'm not so sure anymore.
Sometimes I think that...
...there's no justice, only the law.
- Are you looking for Nikolai Maksudov?
- Yes.
Upstairs, to the right,
...just push, the door is open.
Nikolai Maksudov?
Nikolai!
Master?
Good morning, Oscar Danilovic.
Forgive my boldness, they told me the door was open.
Don't worry, Oscar Danilovic.
- We all do it.
- Comrade Berlioz sent me.
My visit is private,
...let's say, confidential.
Nikolai, you know how much Berlioz appreciates you.
Excuse me for speaking like that, but Berlioz is a true friend of yours.
Did you come just to say me that?
Look...
Berlioz, and all of us,
...believe that the best thing for you...
...would be to send everything to hell and go to Yalta.
Yalta! It's a paradise!
Sea, sun...
Not everyone is that lucky.
And if I didn't feel like going?
You'd better think it over.
I'm sorry, but I really can't go.
I'm thinking of writing a novel.
A novel?
A novel about Satan.
In Moscow.
You understand I can't leave everything here on it's own.
As you wish, Nikolai Maksudov.
Either you'll withdraw
"Pontius Pilatus" spontaneously,
...or we'll have to discuss your case, today...
...at the Union's plenary session,
...with all the consequences.
Then go to hell.
Citizen!
You should not be unkind to animals.
Go to hell, you and your animals!
Well,
...I didn't mentioned hell,
...but you'll go there, no doubt of it!
One should be nice to animals,
...and black cats, in particular should be treated especially well.
Would you like a ride, citizen?
I'm sure you're going far.
To Treskaia street.
It's not true that there's always sun in Yalta.
Right now, for example, it's raining.
What?
Yes, yes, it's raining.
You'll catch a good cold today,
Oscar Danilovic.
Where are we?
And you ask me?
We're in Yalta, damn it!
How disgraceful, citizen.
Papers?
Where's your suit?
- In Moscow.
- It's not funny!
- Foreign ships come through here.
- My name is Oscar Danilovic.
I'm a writer, a secretary of the Union of Proletarian Writers.
A few moments ago, you got me a taxi in Moscow. How's that possible?
Couldn't you have a twin brother?
I don't know what are you talking about!
Come with me.
Maksudov, have you seen Oscar Danilovic?
Yes.
Let's start without him.
For the long time...
...the conduct of one of our members, has been strongly opposed...
...to the statuses of our Union.
We must be at the service of the masses...
...and he dusts off the religious myths!
These are not the Middle Ages, comrades.
Comrade Rimski speaks the truth!
I totally agree with him!
"Help."
"Please, confirm my identity."
"The Yalta police arrested me as foreign spy."
"Oscar Danilovic."
Nicolai, are you sure that you saw
Oscar Danilovic this morning?
Of course.
He wanted to send me to Yalta.
Comrades...
It's not your turn, Nicolai.
Others asked to speak before you.
Comrades, before this session
I met with union management,
...and this morning I caught in my home,
Oscar Danilovic,
...snooping around my papers.
Nicolai!
Are you crazy?
Forgive me, Berlioz.
I know I'm causing you pain.
But the truth is, that you wanted to buy me off.
Yes, I know that at first glance it may not appear worthwhile...
...but you wanted to buy my freedom.
I declare...
...that my freedom is not for sale!
The freedom to write implies the freedom of the citizen.
At least I think so.
Without the real liberty there can't be real socialism.
Don't you agree, Berlioz?
Nobody can force me to withdraw a work which I believe is right.
Nobody can force me to be silent.
Comrades, you may misunderstood my worlds,
...but not my writing!
What the hell is he talking about?
About freedom, you idiot.
Dramatist Bobov has the voice.
I know him very well.
Have we gathered here...
...just to hear his sermon?
He saw his name on the affiches on the walls...
...and he thinks he's a Tolstoy!
Let him return home to his mistress!
Thank you, comrade Bobov.
Critic Lavrovic has the voice.
I strongly condemn...
I have the voice and
I don't cede it to anyone!
Look at him!
The Master,
...I'm a writer, too.
But he can write whatever he wants,
...and I must follow the directives.
I'm not saying it is not fair,
...but down with privileges!
Everything for some, and nothing for others!
I share a single room and he has two rooms for himself,
...and he even got a bathroom!
Comrades, Bobov is drunk!
But no one keeps him from talking.
We can't go on, like that!
I don't understand anything!
The Master is one of our greatest writers!
Silence!
Sit down, idiot!
Despite comrade Bobov, declamation being too emotional...
...his comments on the Master are to the point.
I propose that we name the Commission...
...to examine the comrade's Maksudov case.
And you, Nicolai what do you have to say?
It's your turn, now.
What can I say?
The decision has already been made.
Pontius Pilatus
How's the play?
No rehearsals today. All postponed.
May I see what's in the paper?
You can take it,
I've already read it.
This table is reserved for the critic Lavrovic.
No, there must be a mistake.
This table is mine.
This restauration is reserved for proletarian writers, only.
You can't stay here.
I'm a very famous writer.
I write in all languages.
I just asked you because we don't want...
Will you be leaving soon?
Don't count on it.
I'm waiting for the best.
Rimski.
Can't you see I'm dancing?
The review of my "Pontius Pilatus" was in today's papers.
Yes, and?
The play was never performed.
How should I know what the press does?
I'm just in charge of the theater.
They couldn't have seen it without your permission.
They haven’t seen it.
At least not in my theater.
And as far as I know they'll never see it.
The commission decided to withdraw my play...
...before it could be seen,
...and the critics play along with this farce!
Good!
Ask the critics then, not me.
There's Lavrovic.
Are you Lavrovic?
I read your review of my "Pontius Pilatus".
Have you seen the play?
Is it necessary to see certain plays to condemn them?
Our job is to not confuse the masses,
...because the masses also have a soul.
You're Latunski, right?
I'd like to talk with you.
Tell me the truth, Berlioz.
- Is my work so bad?
- No, it's not bad.
Then you're guiltier than the others,
...because you understand more then them.
Berlioz,
...you sold your conscience.
- I'm not like you.
- Of course not.
We're no equal, Berlioz.
- You're the man of authority.
- Yes,
- ...and I will use it.
- What's wrong with you?
You've just used worlds from my "Pontius Pilatus"?
What if someone were here to hear you?
What's wrong?
Don't you feel well?
Nothing, nothing.
I'm better now.
I had some kind of hallucination.
Maybe it's time to send it all to hell and get some rest.
In Yalta?
What was I going to say?
Ah, yes.
That Jesus of yours,
...the so-called son of God...
...doesn't exist.
He never existed.
If I understand you correctly,
...you say that Jesus never existed?
Yes, that's what I said.
Good, very good.
- You're an atheist?
- Yes. I'm an atheist.
Allow me to congratulate you...
...with all my heart.
There's no need for that.
Being an atheist is natural in our country.
Someone who reasons can't believe in God.
Very good!
That's exactly...
...what old Immanuel Kant used to tell me.
And he is also the one who later...
...demonstrated existence of God.
If he hadn't die 200 years ago, today they'd put him in the madhouse.
The place where he is now isn't the place he wanted for himself.
Besides, I told him,
...when we dined together one day:
"Professor, professor,"
"...your ideas are too complicated,"
"...people will laugh at you. "
But please forgive me.
I forgot to introduce myself.
I too, am a professor,
...of Black Magic.
My name is Woland.
I came to Moscow to do historical research...
...on the existence of God.
Please tell me,
...if God never existed,
...who directed mankind? Who governed and continue to govern the world?
- Man!
- Man is mortal!
Tell me...
...perhaps you know what will happen to you tonight.
I'll preside over the session of the Proletarian Writers,
...unless a roof tile falls on my head.
Please...
A roof tile never falls on a person's head by chance.
Don't be afraid of roof tile.
You'll die in another way.
You'll be decapitated.
By whom?
My enemies?
The intervents?
By a young woman...
...with a red scarf round her neck.
Now go!
- I must go.
- Go!
And in the few moments of life left you,
...remember that Jesus existed!
I saw him and talked to him!
And the devil?
Doesn't he exist either?
If we go on like this nothing exists.
That wretch is running to the office to the phone.
It's no use.
Anushka's already spilled the sunflower oil.
Catch you!
Let go of me!
What do you want?
What's going on?
Should I inform someone of that tragedy?
Berlioz!
Berlioz!
It wasn't my fault!
It wasn't my fault!
He run into me!
I braked, comrades!
I swear!
Poor man! He slipped on the oil and...
Off with his head.
Anushka spilled the oil, and he slipped.
- Where's the head?
- It disappeared.
I know...
I know who cut Berlioz's head off.
Who?
The Devil.
This is no time for jokes.
Professor!
Professor!
Berlioz is dead.
Killed by Satan.
There is no doubt!
It could only be the devil.
I saw it!
The tram cut his head off.
And now they can't find it.
This is his hat.
Calm down.
We know you're worried,
...you just need some peace.
What? You speak of peace and the devil is in the city!
Yes I saw him!
He came for people like you!
Yes! you, Bobov!
When the last time you told the truth?
And you! Did you ever sacrifice yourself for anything?
And you! Did you ever love anyone who was beneath you?
You're all the same!
Hypocrites and scoundrels!
You don't have a single opinion you would risk anything for it.
You're only interested in your accounts,
...privileges and your dirty lies!
With your cowardice you betrayed the revolution!
They won't let me work,
...and without work my life is meaningless.
If I can't write plays for the theater
I'll ask the management...
...for a job as an extra,
...and if I'm no good, for one as stage technician.
But don't keep me away from theater, because it's my life.
I belong to this country and I believe in socialism.
I suffered for the revolution, because then as now,
...I believed that revolution meant freedom.
Stop persecuting me, or shoot me on spot.
Let me live, or kill me,
...just don't bury me alive.
I've been looking for you,
I've been calling you all day.
I suffered for you.
Why didn't you answer?
They disconnected my phone, they don't want me to talk.
What they will do to you?
Nothing, nothing.
Margherite, I'm not well.
I'm in a sorry state.
I see.
- Margherite, I saw him.
- Who?
Him.
The tram cut off Berlioz's head.
He had foreseen it.
He had foreseen it all.
He also said...
...that Berlioz'd slip in a sunflower oil stain,
...and then he vanished.
Then it's true,
...you really aren't well.
No...
Listen, I wrote a letter.
Very important letter.
It's here on the table.
Please mail it right away.
Tomorrow I'll come for good.
We'll wake up together everyday.
I'll come and live among your useless things.
See you tomorrow.
- Who are you?
- Me? Grunja.
Where's Nicolai?
What are you doing here?
We should be asking you that.
Showing up in another persons house like this is bad manners.
And we're...
...educated people... decent people.
Grunja, tell her to get out from our apartment.
Please.
Tell me where he is.
We were here together last night.
He couldn't have vanished like this overnight.
What?
You're still here?
This is our house now.
I don't know who lived here before, and I don't want to know.
Come, Grunja.
Wipe that scribblings off the walls.
Excuse me, are you director of the theater?
Yes. What do you want?
- Where's Nicolai Maksudov?
- What do you want with him?
Where's Nicolai Maksudov?
And why should I know?
I'm not interested in peoples' private affairs.
At least tell me where
I should look for him.
At his place. Dverski 25, passage,
...the attic.
Couldn't he have moved?
You're a coward and a liar.
They're burying Berlioz,
...President of the Proletarian
Writers' Union.
Look, Margherite Nikolajevna,
...they're burying the dead man and they can't find his head.
I don't know you.
True, You can't know me.
Oh, yes...
...they stole Berlioz's head.
I wonder who'd need it?
There wasn't much inside it.
"A shadow come from the sea..."
"...and covered Jerusalem..."
"...on the 14th day of the spring month of Nizan."
My God!
I'll be grateful for not speaking
His name...
...in my presence.
Berlioz is dead.
But he is alive.
Yes, he is.
Who are you?
I've been given different names...
...depending on the time and place.
Samael,
...Belial,
...Belzebub, Lucifer,
...even Satan.
But to you I'm Woland.
Professor Woland.
A Black Magic specialist.
You will find the Master.
You'll see him soon.
I promise.
Good morning citizen, Bobov.
Sympathetic citizen Bobov.
Who are you?
Don't you know?
I'm professor Woland.
My dear Bobov, no aspirin will help you,
...you ate a lot and drank too much wine and vodka, Bobov.
It's very bad for your intestines.
You were upset by Berlioz's death?
Too bad!
But it's already noon...
...and you're still in my apartment.
Grunja!
Who does this cat belong to?
I'm very tired,
...an my show opens tonight at 8 at the theater.
It'll be what they've always dreamt of.
Art for the masses!
I assure you it'll be sublime.
You want to phone, too?
It's become an obsession.
Hail, brother!
Hail, Bobov!
That monster is Azazelo.
The one who's about to kill you.
Ah, Bobov!
I can't understand how Bobov...
...could become a dramatist.
If he's a dramatist,
I'm a cardinal!
And you Sire, why do you even speak to him?
Isn't he that scum
I've wanted to talk to?
I'm listening, Bobov.
With your permission, Sire, but that guy has nothing to say.
He hasn't said a sensible thing in his entire life.
Isn't that right, Bobov?
What are you doing here?
This is not your house.
Speak!
Cat got your tongue?
Oh, yes.
He's well known for being a talkative man.
His reports to police are numerous.
As far as the Master is concerned,
...it's abominable!
Do you enjoy being alive, Bobov?
Why do you enjoy being alive?
Back, Satan!
Satan...
Satan...
He was greedy, avid.
He ate and drunk too much.
A heart attack...
Who but the devil could foresee a man's death so precisely?
Only the Satan could eliminate a man of authority in such fashion.
Only the devil could come to Moscow...
...to demonstrate the existence of God.
Any veneral diseases in your family?
What are you doing?
Camrade Maksudov, we want to help you to get well.
I'm not ill.
Of course. But you are a little nervous and this will calm you down.
You need rest.
What rest?
You rest when you need to.
- I want to go!
- Where?
- I must find him.
- Who?
A Satan.
An obvious case of schizophrenia.
I'm not insane...
It's just an excuse...
...but I wouldn't trade places with Bobov...
...or Latunski...
...or the others.
Sir, please open the door.
Here comes the other little worm.
Oh, it's you.
I'm looking for comrade Bobov.
You're expected! Come in!
Come in.
- I came to...
- A yes, why?
...to return the "Pontius Pilatus" manuscript to comrade Bobov.
No not there. that goes to the trash can.
My dear Lavrovic!
How nice to see you!
Come in.
Come.
Make yourself at home.
This place is yours.
Come.
Sit down Lavrovic.
What are you waiting for?
Are you hurt?
I'd...
I'd like to leave.
You haven’t arrived yet and already want to leave?
- Well you can't.
- Sit down.
Good...
I see you remembered to bring the manuscript...
...of the Master's play.
Tell me,
...did you write that article without anybody having seen the play?
Not even you?
That's not very honest, don't you think?
You're a coward, Lavrovic.
A great coward!.
You mustn't confuse people.
He has a great responsibility to the masses and to the Party.
And he writes his reviews with grammatical errors!
Shit.
Would you like a glass of wine?
We have excellent vintage.
Thank you, but I don't drink.
We were about to play poker...
...we just needed a fourth player.
I never play cards.
That's no good.
A man who doesn't like gambling or wine,
...or beautiful women is either sick or a coward.
Then it's true.
Azazelo was right.
Lavrovic is a coward.
- Is he a coward?
- No, he is just sick.
Sit down!
He doesn't know that he will die in five months time and of what!
March the 30th.
Of liver cancer.
In the best state clinic.
- In the clinic.
- In ward D.
But I know.
Off you go, Lavrovic!
Get out!
Do you know how long you've had cancer?
Since you wrote that article about the Master's play!
Get out!
Don't forget your hat!
I'm not crazy!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Open up!
Open up! Open up!
We did a good job, didn't we, Sire?
And what's that lazy Korovjev doing?
Here I am, Majesty.
I nearly killed myself through work, and you know it, don't you?
<b>Today Evening Opening Night!</b>
<b>Religion is an opium for the masses.</b>
What's going on?
Let me through.
Let me through!
I'm director of this theater!
Come comrade, come.
<b>Pontius Pilatus</b>
It's an unprecedented provocation!
We put as many obstacles as we could,
...the author’s in the madhouse, and they advertise like that?!
In my opinion there's a reason.
They want to see who the
Union's new leader should be.
So what should we do?
Actually, that "Pontius Pilatus" isn't bad.
I always said so.
The thing is Berlioz didn't approve of it.
He made me write that damned review.
Instead of recriminating,
...it would be better to phone the Ministry.
Hello?
The People's Ministry of Culture?
Yes, Minister of Culture, speaking.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
The premiere of "Pontius Pilate" will take place tonight.
Very good, Rimski!
Reserve two front-row seats for me, please.
And another thing,
...the famous Professor Woland...
What?
You never heard of professor
Woland?
Well, that'll change soon.
Tonight, before the play he'll perform a seance of Black Magic.
Of Black Magic!
It was the Minister.
He said he already knows everything.
It's a test.
They want to see if we're in the line and if we obey.
- And we obey?
- Of course!
Esteemed audience,
...after lengthy preparations,
...we present you the drama
"Pontius Pilatus" by Nicolai Maksudov,
...but tonight we offer you a double show.
A foreign artist, professor Woland,
...will present an unusual show...
...of Black Magic.
We know that magic is superstition,
...and the show is precisely dedicated...
...to unmasking the magic.
Professor Woland!
- Azazelo!
- Yes?
Do you know who this idiotic announcer is?
I have no idea.
Do you think he's finished making his stupid remarks?
He's gone.
Where are we now?
We are on earth, you idiots.
What do you see?
It moves.
What?
I can't make it out.
- Man!
- Do they look bad?
No.
Not yet.
Are they different from the rest?
It's hard to know.
All right.
We'll see soon enough.
We can start.
Respected audience,
...in this hat is a 100 ruble note.
A real 100 ruble note!
It's gone.
It blew away!
No, it didn't take off.
No, it didn't take off.
It's there in the 7th row.
- Citizen Parcevski has it.
- Exactly!
It's in citizen's Parcevski wallet,
...along with his I.D.,
...and a summon from the tribunal,
...for not having deposited food quota for his ex wife.
Professor Woland...
...will give everyone a 100 ruble note!
Citizens!
It is just a trick!
A simple trick!
Dialectical materialism can explain it all!
So, explain it!
Esteemed citizens,
I beg you to forgive this poor fool.
How disgraceful, comrade Rimski, behaving that way in front of people!
What will they think of comrade Azazelo?
If this bore wouldn't show up...
...your pockets would be full now!
A 100 ruble note for each one of you!
And instead nothing!
Citizens!
This is a case of mass hypnosis!
An interesting experiment.
Let's ask the professor...
...to explain his trick.
You'll see how the fake 100 rubles that Parcevski has in his pocket...
...disappear at instant the same way they appeared.
It's not true!
Citizens Parcevski's rubles are genuine!
Do you take us for charlatans?
Are you suggesting Latunski,
...that yours dollars are also fake?
They are real and here they are!
Latunski, Latunski...
Don't you know that trading dollars is forbidden?
You can get five years for that!
Citizens artists it would be appropriate,
...to immediately reveal your tricks to the public.
Excuse me?
What?
You must reveal your tricks.
Ah no...
I'm sorry but there's nothing to reveal.
- Everything is clear.
- No, please,
...we need to know.
The audience demands the explanation.
And I say that audience doesn't demand any such thing.
But if you'd like me to reveal the truth, I'll humor you.
Tell me where were you last evening, Ariman?
Last evening my husband was working in his editorial office.
I don't see the point...
There's nothing magical in it.
Yes Madam.
We didn't expect you to understand,
...but Ariman wasn't in his editorial office.
He spent the evening with an actress, from the travelling theater...
...Milizia Nikolajevna Pokobazko.
A charming young lady, twenty years younger than you!
And now - Margherite's Fashion Store!
Everything you see is yours!
We exchange old for a new,
...national for foreign.
All styles!
Evening suits, sandals, shoes...
Everything is imported!
And all is free!
Magnificent!
Go on!
Go on!
Our spectators are impatient!
How beautiful!
Stupendous!
One...
Two...
Three.
They're not real dresses!
Stop!
Stop!
I want you to know that this was not in the program.
We're getting tired of this guy.
Police!
Police!
Stop! Lower the curtain!
It's dangerous!
We'll all end in jail!
Get out!
Didn't you hear?
Get lost!
Out!
A doctor!
Are you going to keep saying stupid things?
No! Not anymore!
- Will you make more phone calls?
- No, no!
Will you spy again?
- No I won't do that anymore!
- Are you sure?
I'm sure! I'll never do it again!
I swear! Mercy!
Mercy!
Should we forgive him?
Mercy! Forgive him!
Have mercy!
Forgive him!
Sire, tell me what
I'm supposed to do.
People are the same everywhere.
...they love money,
...they're frivolous, ambitious.
But sometimes one finds the way to their hearts.
It rarely happens.
You can put his head back on.
Leave, disappear!
It's more fun without you.
One...
Two...
Three.
Bring in the accused!
He has read your play.
Unfortunately, He can't completely approve of it,
...so He won't take you into the Light.
But you will be granted Peace.
That's Pilatus wine.
Falernian.
It's 2000 years old.
I'm telling you that all authority is just a violence against man.
Do you realize what you're saying?
Why do you ask, Hegemon?
Do I look like a madman?
I didn't make it. It's all over...
I'm sorry.
Take him away. He's under arrest...
But don't hurt him. He's won.
Rest, Karen. Rest...
In three moons you'll be a warrior. Resist,
Marayà wants you to. Little arrows...
Great pain... you must not die...
I can't take anymore...
And it's only the first day...
How can I get through this?
My wounds are killing me...
The sun's blinding...
But I musn't fall asleep... I can't...
If I sleep I'm done for...
My throat's burning...
I'm so thirsty... thirsty... Marayà, I'm thirsty...
Go away!
Thai! Thai!
Come on, eat... go ahead...
This sword is yours... along with the strength of the warriors.
You've now earned wisdom.
Thai! The little's boy's ill!
He's suffocating! Run, quick!
Diptheria... It's very serious...
There's no time to lose.
No! It's the evil spirits. Lahuna, send him away!
He's dying, Lahuna. We've got to save him before it's too late!
Hold him tight.
Today's an important day for our village. One of you will become my daughter's groom...
This necklace is a token of my affection... I'm sure you'll be worthy of it.
Now go. My daughter is yours.
Let her be fertile. Let her be fertile...
Bradley! We've got it!
The net!
Are you tired?
You're more beautiful like this.
My man... I loves you...
I LO VE you. No, Marayà.
You think you love me.
But you don't know what love means yet.
You're doing better, eh?
Sit down. I have to tell you something very important.
All of us feel great joy today... Marayà's pregnant.
Baby... The sorcerer... he said he'll be strong...
A son! My little savage!
You must break... It brings good luck.
Marayà! What's the matter? You feel ill?
Don't worry... It's normal.
I feel better now... Much better.
Six months have gone by.
Day after day of a new life
I hadn't thought possible.
Civilization... my job... London... the world...
...it's all so far away, useless and strange.
Now my world is this faraway village.
My reason for living is Marayà and the son I'll have with her.
A son! He'll need me, his father. He'll be a little rebellious savage. Like you!
She's yours!
I come from this country... here's my city.
What's a city?
A city's like a great village, full of tall huts that reach the sky...
The streets are made of hard earth and there are lots of cars...
Cars? - Yes, there're carts that make noise... But this is too hard for you.
Once more: Repeat.
London... Woman... Man... Baby...
Our baby!
What happened?
Cannibals... The Kuru...
Don't move.
Bradley... my head... such pain inside... I can't see anymore...
Thai! Take her to the village.
She's ill. Hurry! Come with me...
Let's go! Quick!
Prepare to die! Your tongue! Hold still!
Thai... Bradley... Where are you?
I'm here, Marayà. How do you feel?
My eyes... It hurts inside...
Don't be afraid. You're weak... It's just a condition...
You're due in just a little while...
It's all dark! I can't see anything anymore!
Don't worry. You're just tired... you'll feel better tomorrow.
Sleep... Don't think about anything...
I'm here nearby... I won't leave you.
Hurry! We don't have much time!
I have to make it, Taima. I have to reach a large city...
It's the only way to save her.
When you arrive great river... Follow current south... You will find village.
Hurry, go.
I thank you with all my heart, Taima.
No! Don't kill me!
On your knees! You must die! Kill her!
It's not your decision. I'm the one who makes the decisions.
No, have pity... I beg you to let me live... No, I beg you...
Are you tired?
No, I'm fine.
Elephants! Hold on tight!
Let's land. It's no use anymore...
Capture them!
What's the river like? Tell me what you see.
There are children playing in the water...
There's Mihuan fishing from his boat.
Have the Marabu already flown away?
The last ones are flying away now.
Stay still... don't move. A white butterfly's landed on your belly.
Is it still there?
Yes, it's there.
They're the last butterflies... The rains are coming... and our son with them.
It was the last time I brought Marayà to the river.
She didn't get up again. Her illness got worse...
I was desperate. After the last attempt to bring her to Bangkok...
I could no longer do anything for her... The tribe didn't allow it.
Marayà had to die.
Get out! You too... Out!
The baby... has to be born... My head... feels so bad inside...
The labor is delayed... The baby is suffering... What can we do?
Are you suffering a lot?
No... Don't worry...
There's a butterfly...
What color is it?
Black.
What's it mean?
Death!
What's our son like? -Beautiful.
He's beautiful like his mother.
We'll bring him to the river to fish... And you'll play with him in the flowers...
You must take care of our son... The spirit of death is carrying me away...
You'll get better. In a few days you'll see our son with your own eyes.
I promise. We'll be happy together.
I'll be carried away by the wind... but the wind will bring me back to you...
Please, help our people... They need you.
Father... I want to be united with this man forever...
Come! There's no danger.
It's gone. Go back to work...
We must rebuild the village...

Wise, gimme that.
George, lets get out as many as we can.
Bring them out now.
Don't overload me Conway!
Mr. Lovett?
Calme vu.
It's all right.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Patients, patients.
Please be patient.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Please.
Don't worry. Everyone will get away.
Please don't worry the planes are coming.
Get me Hong Kong will you.
Talking to them sir.
Hello it's Conway here. Where are those planes you promised me?
I still got a whole lot of people to get out.
The whole towns on fire and the guerrillas are nearly here.
That runway won't take heavy jets.
We've sent you every other plain we could commandeer, even freighters.
Now, Fenner's in charge.
They should be there any time. Now, take your people and clear out.
My people! What about the rest of them here?
Richard, Bill Ferguson here.
Yes Bill?
We've had a lot of flak from your local military authority.
They have forbidden us to let you evacuate any of their nationals.
The ST says you are to take only your own group, only those you have listed.
Do you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you Bill, but it's not...
- Hey, it's the planes.
They're here.
Just a minute, we think the planes are here.
Thank you.
Oh my god, whats happen.
They must have blown up the generator.
Come on.
Those planes can't land without light.
Hello, Hong Kong.
Come in Hong Kong.
Let's go.
[Chele', Chele'!]
[Chele'!]
[Ah' roo cha']
[Chele' Chele' Chele'
Chele' Chele']
Let's get back to the main building.
Here they are, now let have the next group.
Only the women.
All right quiet please, just calm down.
Hay Miss. Come on, you get left behind.
Let the heroes go first.
You an American?
No, Mongolian.
You have to teach me the language sometime.
He's away.
We go on the next plane. Bring out everybody that's left.
Right.
Hello Fenner.
Hello Conway.
Having a little trouble?
Enough.
Does this thing really fly?
From time to time she does.
Over there. Keep them back.
Tell Fenner to take off.
Fenner, let's go!
Fenner!
Get down! Get down on the floor!
Get down!
Fenner, come on!
Fenner, takeoff!
Come on Fenner!
Fenner!
Everybody all right?
Yeah, sure.
Now we all have a long journey ahead of us.
Now I suggest you make yourselves as comfortable as possible.
Right?
- Fine.
- OK.
G-George, see if you can find some food.
Uh, where we heading?
Hong Kong.
Who are you? I don't remember listing you.
Yeah, well I sort of arrived the last minute.
Names Harry Lovett the comedian.
Just finished three solid weeks, top of the bill, Saigon USO.
Terrific audience those guys.
I love um'.
Saigon?
What were you doing in Baskul.
Yeah, well, we had a few drinks and someone said "Let's go see the Temples."
And there was this plane and we had a few more drinks and uh, all of a sudden we were in the middle of the jungle.
Temple of Baskulla was pretty funny.
Then the shells start falling and nobody's laughing.
All right, I'll get some particulars from you later.
Hi, name's Harry Lovett.
The Comedian.
Sam Cornelius. The Engineer.
Milk and sandwiches.
Milk? Somebody at headquarters has a sense of humor.
Dish it out.
I'm going to make out my report, while I can still remember the details.
No thank you.
Of course...
You're Sally Hughes, of Newsweek.
Yes.
IÆm George Conway,
London Express.
Hello.
Richards my brother.
I was covering him on the peace talks when the whole thing blew up.
Well did you get some good stuff on the airfield just now?
Look, I'm through with all this!
And I'm tired.
I'm sorry.
The way Fenner is flying this thing we're in for a rough night.
I uh, just found some jungle juice.
Can I freshen your milk?
Sure.
It's pretty rough eh?
Yeah.
Were you on a project back there?
Yeah.
Really?
Really.
Well, take it easy.
Ah, well gentlemen, I ah,... not been too successful up front.
Could I interest you in a little bourbon?
Oh, you're our man.
Yes.
Great.
Great?
Well, God Save the Queen.
Cheers.
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway, wake up.
Look outside.
We're traveling in the wrong direction.
Look, I know I flunked boy scout, but from what I remember the sun rises in the east.
Hong Kong is east, we're going west.
He's right. The suns behind us.
It's desert down there.
Must be a reason.
Fenner too good a pilot to get lost.
What goes on?
Fenner?
Fenner?
What's happening?
Fenner?
[Meet say nay grean?]
- Whats happening?
- It's a hijack!
Hijacking DC-3. Come on.
That's what it looks like.
Well, what are we going to do?
What do you suggest?
He could be a maniac, we gotta do something.
Such as?
Be quite!
Now listen everybody, there's nothing we can do about this for the moment.
So I suggest you all sit down and as far as possible, relax.
That guy has a gun!
There's nothing we can do about it until he lands, now please, sit down.
George.
We're heading down!
We're going to land.
I don't see a landing strip, do you?
[Ming mashe ta lue]
[Ming mashe ta lue]
[Ah sha tee]
[Ah sha tee]
[Ming mashe ta lue]
[Ling pi oh]
[Ay Sing ling bi oh]
[Sing ling bi oh]
Let's find out what's going on.
I think their refueling.
[Say poo da la ca poo]
The other facts to consider are these.
That the fuel was waiting, the armed men were waiting,
And they wouldn't let us off.
If this was an ordinary hijacking they would have kept us back there in the desert.
- Exactly.
- It could be political.
That means you Richard.
I doubt it. The whole point is on ***
Oh c'mon Conway, you'd be a price in anybody's book.
And for good measure they got two journalist.
And by his own account, a famous comedian.
Very funny but, what about you Cornelius.
Maybe they want you.
Who are you!
I'm somebody flying a strange plane, to a strange place, with a lunatic pilot and I'm trying to find out why, that's who I am.
All right all right all right.
God he's really going high.
What's the ceiling on these planes?
I don't know.
Let's see if that oxygen equipment works.
Thank you.
If the altitude gets you, swallow hard.
Or hold your noseà And blow.
That's it.
Here.
Hold it.
Breathe deeply.
- OK?
- OK.
This one's empty.
Now take deep breaths.
Slowly, slowly.
Is that any better?
I feel like were heading for outer space.
Easy now.
Mmm.... You know a guy to get to like this.
What's happening?!
He's losing his left engine.
Seat belts, strap in!
Brace yourselves! Lean forward.
Right, forward.
Lock your hands behind your head!
Don't let them snap back!
Ahhh!
Get down!
Oh!
Are you all right?
Look after the others.
How are the others?
Shaken, but OK.
He's had it.
Here's a map.
You see that spot where he's marked
I'll bet that's where we refueled.
There's the end of civilization.
We must be 1000 miles beyond that.
Just a blank here on the map.
Hay, whats happening Conway?
Conway?
Don't tell them about this George.
- Conway.
- Just a minute.
- How are you?
- I'm all right.
Where the hell are we?
Down on solid ground and it feels great.
What are you doing?
Listen buddy, I don't know about you, but I'm scared and this helps.
What's the situation?
- The pilots dead.
- Well where are we?
As far as I can make out, in an unexplored part of the world.
How do we get out?
At the moment we don't.
We stay here.
Only a fully equipped expedition could last outside.
So here we stay, all calm and cool.
We're sure gonna' be cool.
It's not so bad we've got ahà blankets, a stove, emergency rations.
We can get through the days. The nights maybe a little bit more difficult.
But will manage, until somebody finds us.
Till somebody finds us.
They will.
- I've got another one to work.
- Good.
Hear, hear.
Drink this. It hasn't got much taste, but it's hot.
As a matter of fact it hasn't got any taste at all.
I'll try one then.
All right, à there.
Mr. Conway.
There lights out there.
Mr. Conway there are lights out there!
Hey, there are people out there, moving in the snow.
Coming towards us, down that mountain!
There is something, they found us!
I knew they would, I knew it!
Come on.
Conway, what is this?
[I non cee, holla?]
I am from a nearby Lamasery.
My name is Chang.
Mine is Richard Conway.
How do you do?
How you do.
Forgive me, I hadn't expected anybody in this part of the world to talk English.
I was an undergraduate at
Oxford in my young days.
It was there that I had the opportunity of improving my knowledge of your language.
You speak it very well.
You have no idea how welcome you are.
Yesterday our plane left
Baskulla for Hong Kong but we suddenly found ourselves hijacked and traveling in the opposite direction.
- The pilotà
- Where is your pilot?
He was killed in the crash.
May I see him?
Please.
[Marie ta' ma green ta luu']
Mr. Chang, you're obviously on a journey of your own, but could you possibly take us to your Lamasery?
I would consider it an honor.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey.
It is not particularly far but it is quite difficult.
I suggest we start at daybreak.
Aah!
Welcome to Shangri
La, Mr. Conway.
You see we are sheltered by mountains on every side.
A strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful.
Come, let me show you.
This is Brother To Len.
He will show you to your rooms.
Shangri-La welcomes you.
If you should wish to assume our habits of dress you will find suitable garments.
You would need to rest now.
And later I shall be most pleased to see you all at dinner.
Mr. Chang.
Please.
I am happy to report that the plane has arrived.
With Richard Conway?
With Conway and four others.
Excellent.
What are we going to do now?
What we always do?
- Miss. Hughes!
- Gasp!
That is the coward's way out.
You are in the midst of life.
Do not seek death, it will find you.
But choose the road that makes death a fulfillment.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, a funny thing happened to me on the way to the Airport.
Get a load of the outfit have Kimona will travel.
Both look pretty silly.
When in Rome, do as the romans do.
C'mon, let's get something to eat, take a quick look around the place, and catch the first train out here.
We've just crash a plane in the middle of nowhere, spent all day dragging ourselves up a mountain and you're looking for the nearest ticket office?
Man, where do you think we're gonna go?
Um, suits you.
I thought I might find Chang here.
No, sorry.
I'm not doing very well so far I failed to find him orà
- Telephone or telex.
- Telex?
Even a socket for my razor.
Hard luck.
- You better use mine.
- Thanks.
Seriously, I must get in touch with my paper.
Well an hour or two won't make any difference will it?
It does to me. I want to get this story off before we eat.
And I want a few more peaceful moments before the world gets its claws into me again.
Oh well, in that case,
I'll make a big sacrifice.
I'll shave and shut up.
Thank you George,
I'm very grateful.
Until dinner.
? Friendly doors open wide ?
? Come and share the peace and life you will find inside ?
? Share the joy ?
? Let the sun comfort you ?
? It will keep you safe and warm, always shining through ?
? Share the joy ?
? All the lovely songs you will hear, ?
? means we all hold dear ?
? At the same time ?
? All the grandest things we possess, ?
? means we value less ?
? So many small things can bring happiness ?
? Love is in all things ?
? Flowers bloom, people grow ?
? You may never want to leave when it's time to go ?
? Share the joy ?
? Mountains rise, mountains fall ?
? You have nothing more to prove, you have climbed them all ?
? Now you're here ?
? May you ?
? stay and share the joy ?
Now that's the best thing to cheer me up since we got here.
? Now you're here ?
? May you ?
? stay and share the joy ?
Bravo.
Good evening my friends.
Did you think I had forgotten you?
- Have you everything you need?
- Everything thank you.
We're sorry, Miss Hughes?
She asked me to say she's not feeling well, it is nothing serious.
I hope she's well enough to travel when we leave.
Mr. Chang, I have some questions?
Please, ask them.
We all wish to return to civilization as soon as possible.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Mr. Chang, I think I speak for all of us, when I say your hospitality is quite remarkable and we're very grateful.
But were also anxious to go home as soon as we can.
That is always the case Mr. Conway.
And even more urgent, for some of us, is to send cables.
Unfortunately, we lack radio communication of any sort.
It has always been a source of deep regret, that the same mountains that allow us our splendid weather, also prevent adequate wireless reception.
Then perhaps you could send porter's or messengers or some sort.
But I'd really like to tell my agent I'm safe.
He's bound to have some bookings for me.
We have no porter's or messengers.
No porter's, butà
You were rescued by our own people.
Who have never gone beyond the point of which you were found.
Two venture further would be too hazardous.
How'd you get all this stuff brought here?
Ahh, yes.
Well, depending upon favorable weather of course.
There are porters,
500 miles away who sometimes make the journey.
They are our only contact with what you would call, the outside world.
How soon can we get in touch with them?
In that respect you are exceedingly fortunate.
We are expecting a shipment from them at almost any moment.
And when is "almost any moment" Mr. Chang.
Tomorrow, next week?
I cannot forecast the exact date, precisely.
Let me see, I believeà
Aww, yes we have been expecting this particular shipment, for about two years.
But I assure you gentlemen, I shall endeavor to make your stay here as pleasant as possible.
And now, if you'll excuse me, it is getting late.
I hope you will all sleep well.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Goodnight Mr. Conway.
Goodnight sir.
About two years.
Did you believe all that stuff about the porters?
I don't know.
- Don't you care?
- Not really.
It's nice to be in a place where time doesn't matter.
Yes, but you wanna get out of here, don't you?
I don't know what I want.
George, something happen when I arrived.
Did you ever go to a totally strange place and feel from the very first moment that you'd been there before?
Because that's what happened to me.
It's absurd I know.
The feeling so strong thatà
I can't think of anything else.
I've always in the past, wanted to see what it was all about.
To see what was on the other side of the mountain.
Perhaps this is it.
It's likeà coming home.
Well with me, it's the complete reverse.
I can't wait to get back.
But I'll tell you want.
If I, mind my manners and don't rock the boat, will you seriously think about getting out of here, soon.
All right, we'll have a truce.
Till we find out about this place.
And then if we get out here...
If?
Did I say if?
Yes, you did.
Can I ask you a question?
Were we brought here on purpose?
Over 2000 people live in the valley.
And if so, what is the purpose.
In addition to those here in Shangri-Laà
What is Shangri-La?
Who is he? You.
Good heavens, no.
Not I.
Well who, for instance.
In time, you will know.
You know for a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things my dear Conway, that I deeply regret
I cannot discuss.
Shall we continue?
You know, in the outside world, you'd be a knockout.
I bet people would fight to see you dance.
I fear I shall never see you're outside world.
Never see it? Why ever not?
It is not possible.
Am I then, in some way on trial dear Mr. Chang.
Oh no, like everyone else you are on a pilgrimage through life.
By chance, out of your voyage of discovery, is here.
By chance?
Here of course, we have more time for reflection.
Sickness is unknown.
Perfect health is the rule.
And it is quite common for us to live to a very ripe old age.
Indeed.
And does that also apply to those who come here from the outside world.
If it did not, Shangri-La would never have been built.
How old it is your oldest inhabitants?
Um? Let me see?
Considerably over 100 years old.
Considerably.
Yes, still at work, when last I spoke to him.
Climate and diet, these are important of course to keep you young.
But we believe it is the lack of struggle in our way of life.
How often in your countries do you hear the expression,
"He worried himself to death." or " this thing or that thing killed him."
Your lives are, as a rule shorter.
Not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Unfortunately true.
"Climate, diet, and harmony." you said.
And somewhere the guiding mind.
Is that it?
Is it not enough?
What worries me is that it's a little like a dream, from which I shall shorty, but unpleasantly, awake.
You surprised me.
I surprised you?
Yes, as you who have written so much of better worlds should think it a dream when you find one.
Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it.
And this is our school.
This is where we start to prepare our young for the future.

- Oh.
- Children.
Thank you.
Sometime in the future, you shall have the pleasure of meeting her.
Sam, Sam I had the strangest dream last night.
I dreamt I swallowed a
50 pound marshmallow.
And when I woke up my pillow was gone.
- You're getting better.
- I thought so.
- You go on. I'll be with you in a minute.
- OK, hurry it up.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were alone.
What is it?
Lovett had a deck of cards.
I thought you'd... might like to play a game.
Some other time, huh?
Sure.
I didn't think I could hold a card.
Why am I like this?
It helps talking to you.
My little cold knot in my stomach starts easing up.
My memory keeps coming back, that Ià really considered dropping off this balcony.
Would you have done so?
I don't know.
If Chang hadn't called, then maybe I would.
That's what frightens me.
What's happened to me?
Perhaps you can answer that yourself.
Sally, "Golden Girl."
I was always taught, dreams could come true.
That's terrific to believe when you're a kid.
A little more difficult later on when you're a "little more difficult."
All that passionate involvement.
Men, causes.
Going around agonizing about man's inhumanity to man.
I made a good living out of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off.
So other people with their heads still on and usually under hair dryers could get a kick out of them before turning to the nearest recipe.
One day it all made me sick.
The dreams were over.
That is very painful but, also necessary so that you may take the next step.
The next step was to start taking pills to get the dreams back.
The excitement, the loving, the feeling good ones.
The kicks I got, lasted about two and a half minutes.
So you find out, that's not the answer either.
And now?
Nothing.
- The end of the line.
- No!
You had the courage, not to jump.
Which means?
You must tell me.
Answers!
Where the hell are any answers!
I don't know!
Try Miss. Hughes.
Inside me I guess. Is that it?
It would not be wrong to start there.
- May I help you with some tea Mr. Conway?
- Thank you.
Let me see. 19 plus 187 gives me a grand total ofà two hundred and six.
You know if you hadn't told me you were honest Harry,
I'd swear you were cheating.
Of course I'm cheating Sampson, and getting away with it.
I mean there's no fun playing cards if you don't.
And the rest of us, are we all as content as we seem here orà is there some delicious drug in our food?
Or is all this, a mirage?
No, no no no my dear Mr. Conway, we employ no such methods in Shangri-La.
To put it simply, we believe in moderation.
We teach that virtue lies in avoiding excess.
We rule with moderates strictness.
In return we are satisfied with moderate obedience.
As a result our people are moderately sober.
Moderately chase and err... moderately honest.
Then you're more than moderately fortunate.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Well, I brought you this.
Oh, thank you.
- May I look at it?
- Yes.
Do you ever have arguments over women?
Oh, only very rarely.
You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
And supposing somebody wanted some particular woman so badly, he didn't care whether it was good manners or not.
Well in that event.
It would be good manners on the part of the other man...
To ehà
Yes?
To let him have her.
That's very convenient.
I think I like that.
And ah, does this arrangement applied for women also?
Of course. You'd be surprised Mr. Conway how a little courtesy all around can help to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Thank you.
- Hope it has a happy ending.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Excuse me.
Just a minute.
Yes Mr. Conway.
I'mà in a quandary and ahà
I thought thatà you might be able to help me.
I noticed you are having your course in elementary Chang.
What is your problem?
Well, Chang tells me that as soon as I meet a woman I like
I must be prepared to give her up if somebody else likes her as well and I don't think I'm capable of doing that.
- When that happensà
- I think it has.
When that happens the important thing is to try and make theà other fellow, the one who must be courteous.
I see, I hadn't thought of it like that.
Perhaps you could help me with some other questions.
I have so many I hardly know where to begin.
You want to know who I am and what I'm doing here.
- My name is Catherine and I was born here.
- Were you?
Well, almost born here. It was just beyond the pass.
My parents were explorers who couldn't rest until they had seen everything.
Unfortunately, they died just on the other side.
And Chang rescued you.
Fateful Chang, he and his men found me barely alive.
Here I've grown up and here I've been happy.
With no desire to leave.
Absolutely none.
So I should know a good thing when I see it.
Is that it?
That's it.
Goodnight Mr. Conway.
Well my friends you have seen our mountains our valley and our people.
You've heard about our past, now you are seeing our future.
This is our Festival
Of The Family.
A chosen couple perform a ritual, honoring the newly born children.
? Start with a man and you have one ?
? Add on a woman and then you have two. ?
? Add on a child and what have you got? ?
? You've got more than three. ?
? You have what they call a family. ?
? Living Together, Growing
Together, just being together, ?
? that's how it starts. ?
? Three loving hearts all ?
? pulling together, working together, just building together, ?
? that makes you strong. ?
? If things go wrong we'll still get along somehow, ?
? living and growing together. ?
? It just takes wood to build a house. ?
? Fill it with people and you have a home. ?
? Fill it with love and people take root. ?
? It's just like a tree ?
? where each branch becomes a family that's ?
? Living Together, Growing

Yeaahhh!!

I've always been ?

? Or it might frighten her away ?
? Yes it might frighten him away ?
? If we rush we may loose ?
? What we may have found ?
? today. ?
? Mmmmh,
Mmmmm, ?
Hi.
Ah, improving your mind again eh?
You should try it.
Yes.
Yes, maybe you're right.
Then perhaps I can understand what it is about this place that the rest of you seem to enjoy so much.
Tell me, don't you ever give a thought to leaving here?
No. I donÆt know what you left behind but what I left behind, I'm not in such a hurry to see again.
Aw.
Don't listen to her Maria.
She was born to be a recluse.
Hello Maria. I saw you dance at the ceremony, and you were lovely.
Thank you.
I've read these and I've come back for more.
I wonder what will happen when we've read them all.
We'll be about 250 and need new glasses.
You sound like you hate the outside world.
- Do you?
- Well I don't love it.
But what about London and Paris?
And the Greek islands and the Leningrad Ballet.
You mean compared to hear? Oh,
Maria you must be kidding.
Look what you got, plus all the time the world to enjoy it.
Time, à Yes there is time.
Before George came, it didn't seem strange to spend my days in reading.
Talk to myself, dance.
Drift through the days full of nothing but peace and quiet.
It didn't seem too long, but it's different now.
Oh boy, good old George.
Take it from me Maria, Shangri-La has a definite edge over New York City, not to mention
Calcutta and the rest.
But the way George describes it.
Listen Marie, George is a nice guy and I don't mean to knock him, but don't let him kid you there's some sort of wonderland outside.
So all you have is peace and quiet uh-uh.
You have a place here where you can breathe.
Where no violence, no cruelty.
A place where people will take the time to care.
George can have his rat race.
I can do without it.
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? First of all is noise ?
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? Is peace and quiet ?
? I would like to try it ?
? Different people look at life from different points of view ?
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?
? I give it all to you ?
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? I would mention crowds ?
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? Is open spaces ?
? Why can't we change places? ?

You know, those girls would be great in my new act.
They should be so lucky.
You look beautiful.
Thanks. I guess.
Oh I mean, you looked beautiful before but now, you look beautiful.
Tomorrow I got something to tell you.
What's wrong with today?
I can't now, it's a secret.
Alright.
I'm afraid that truces over.
Why?
If we don't get it straight now we never will.
Get what straight?
Who wants to leave, and when and how.
For start, I want you to tell them what you told me.
That we were brought here deliberately.
And what's the point.
They're perfectly happy.
They won't be when they find out.
Will you tell them?
No, and certainly not tonight.
Then I will.
Listen everybody.
My brother wants to explode a small bomb but
I think I better do it.
Sit down George.
Do you realize that we are all prisoners here?
No we're not, we're guest.
We were deliberately kidnapped.
- What is this?
- You have no proof of that.
The pilot of a plane was a man from Shangri-La.
- May have been.
- Stop glossing over the facts.
I want to get out of here.
I can't do it alone
I need to know if anyone else feels as I do?
Well, does anyone else want to leave.
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway.
Ask him if you don't believe me.
Why were we kidnapped and brought here Mr. Chang?
Mr. Conway I'd bring you extraordinary news.
Answer the question.
- Let him go. - Richard! - Let him go!
Mr. Chang,
Forgive my brother's determination to force the issue.
You've been very kind and we appreciate it.
But I think the time has come for you to be more open with us.
Were we brought here deliberately and if so why?
There is no time to answer questions now Mr. Conway.
You must come at once. The
High Lama wishes to see you.
Who is the High Lama?
I thought you ran this place Chang.
Oh no, I'm only a humbled member of the community.
- Please Mr. Conway, you mustà
- Just a minute.
Will your High Lama answer our questions?
That is possible.
Then he's the man that I want to see.
Richard?
Tell him that, I at least intend to leave here.
I was here for five years before I was called.
You cannot appreciate the overwhelming honor that has been bestowed upon you.
It is unprecedented.
Good evening Mr. Conway.
Please come in.
Sit down near me.
I trust, you have been comfortable at Shangri-La since you arrival.
I've liked it very much.
But some of my friends and in particularly my brother are puzzled by the mystery.
I can understand that Mr. Conway.
Perhaps if I told you of Shangri-La's origins things would become clearer.
Thank you.
A Belgian priest named
Father Perrault was was the first European to enter the valley of the Blue Moon.
When was that?
Was the year 1747.
When Father Perrault tumbled into the valley half frozen to death, one of his legs was so badly frostbitten, there being no doctor he was forced to amputate it himself.
- He amputated his own leg?
- Yes.
Oddly enough, later, when the natives came to trust him.
He learned from them that his leg would have healed without amputation.
- With frostbite that's impossible.
- Oh no.
This valley celebrates the natural life.
And he recovered well.
Soon he was making his way around the valley taking a great interest in everything.
He taught his own religion and the best of others.
Instructing the children knowing how important education would be for future generations.
He began building the
Lamasery of Shangri-La with one or two helpers.
But after some years hundreds of the natives who by now had come to respect him helped with the task.
When it was finished he was 108 years old.
He's life works is over.
He became weak and lay in his room for many weeks between life and death.
And then a strange thing happened.
He had a vision of the purpose of Shangri-La, of its entire meaning.
And of his part in it.
From that moment on he began to recover.
And how old was he when he died?
But that's incredible!
Yes my son.
You're still alive
Father Perrault.
Sit down my son.
You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Of mine, Father?
Oh, not the Richard Conway, the public hero, the government servant but the Richard Conway who once wrote,
"There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal."
That man seemed to belong here.
In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
So I was right, we were brought here.
But, what possible use could I be to an already thriving community?
If this community is to continue to thrive, then we need men like you here.
You can work today.
Is there anything more pitiful.
Will surely this is a time of crisis.
But when has the world known any other time.
What madness there is what blindness, what unintelligent leadership.
A furiously harassing marshall, bewildered, humanities, strengthening, not in wisdom but in vulgar passions.
The time must come when evil will destroy itself.
I will not live to see that day.
But you might, my son.
And that is why you have been brought to Shangri-La.
For when the day comes, that the world begins to look for a new life, it is our belief that they will find a reservoir of hope here.
So here we shall stay with our books and our music.
And our medications.
Here we shall be, to guide the footsteps of a weary people.
Here we shall be with our way of life.
There's only one simple rule, à be kind.
And it is our hope that our brotherly love will then spread throughout the world.
And when the strong have devoured each other, then, at lastà the meek shall inherit the earth.
I am tired now my son.
Will you come again?
Yes I will.
? How do I know this is part of my real life? ?
? If there's no pain can
I be sure I feel life? ?
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?
? What good is time when you're sure of tomorrow? ?
? Can there be joy where there has been no sorrow? ?
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?
? Will I find there is really such a thing as peace of mind, ?
? and what I thought was living was truly just confusion, ?
? the chance to live forever is really no illusion, ?
? and this all can be mine? ?
? Why can't I make myself believe it? ?
? Can I accept what
I see around me? ?
? Have I found Shangri-La, or has it found me? ?
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?
? Will I find there is really such a thing as peace of mind, ?
? and what I thought was living was truly just confusion, ?
? the chance to live forever is really no illusion, ?
? and this all can be mine? ?
? Why can't I make myself believe it? ?
? There are things that you see. ?
? Other things you feel. ?
? Feelings can't be seen yet we never doubt they are real. ?
? When you search for the truth don't just use your eyes. ?
? Look inside yourself that is where the truth always lies. ?
? Where knowledge ends faith begins, ?
? and it shines like a star, ?
? till your heart fills with hope and with love. ?
? I have looked in your heart. ?
? I have faith in you. ?
No not there.
I apologize for being away so long.
Well, did you ask aboutà- What was he like? - Richard, did you see him?
Yes.
I saw the High Lama.
And I haven't the answers to all of our questions yet, but I will in time.
And when I do I'll tell you exactly what the situation is.
Particularly about going home.
Until then you all have to trust me.
Come on, come on,
Oh my lord.
- There, gold, the stream is full of it.
- So?
We can smuggle it out. Get those porters to help us.
Correction, you bribe the porters,
I got something better to do.
Such as?
Such as not sitting around worrying about how to spend money in a place where money isn't any good.
But what about when we get out?
Get out, how? Sam you gotta' be more practical.
Trouble with you is you haven't got any inner resources.
Who hasn't? What are you trying to tell me?
Your life is made up of infinite possibilities and you're not realizing one of them.
- Not one.
- For instance?
? When you look at yourself do you like what you see? ?
? If you like what you see, you're the person you should be. ?
? 'Cause your reflection reflects in everything you do, ?
? and everything you do reflects on you. ?
? When you wake up each day do you like how you feel? ?
? If you like how you feel, you've got nothing to conceal. ?
? 'Cause your reflection reflects in everything you do, ?
? and everything you do reflects on you. ?
? Doing something for someone else isn't really for someone else. ?
? It does twice as much for you as something you do just for yourself. ?
? When you lay down to sleep do you like all your dreams? ?
? If you like all your dreams, life's as happy as it seems. ?
? 'Cause your reflection reflects in everything you do, ?
? and everything you do reflects on you. ?
Now you said the other night that these farms around here need better irrigation.
Well you were an engineer, go irrigate them.
Yea!
Excuse me, I was looking for your brother.
He's not here.
She seems to be quite taken with him.
Let's hope that beautiful young women can talk more sense into him than I can.
You spoke of her as young.
My dear friend I hate to dissolution you.
But you must not be deceived by her appearance.
Our way of life has preserved her youth and her beauty.
She came here when she was 20.
She was on her wedding journey but her carriers lost their way in the mountains and the whole party would have perished but for meeting our people.
They brought her here.
That was many, many years ago.
How many?
You are more beautiful than the women of Thailand.
More feminine than the women of France.
More pliable than the women of Japan.
- Moreà
- Stop. Stop.
I don't want to hear about all these other women.
All I want to hear is that, you won't leave me.
Oh, I adore you.
But, I can't stay here.
There's so much I want to do with my life that, I can't do here.
Maria, if I could find a way, would you come back with me?
- There is no way.
- Well there has to be!
Tomorrow I'm going out to the pass that leads out of here, to see if its guarded.
And to look for those porters.
If they exist.
They exist.
They do?
Then why didn't you tell me before?
I hoped you would become contented, like the others.
Con-Contented?
Oh...
Look, I have to get out of here.
Please, will you come with me?
Would you stay with me here if I said no?
Then I will come with you.
The water starts up in the hills all right but about halfway down it's starts going the wrong way.
Now if we put a dam here and these interconnecting bamboo pipes you'd have the whole valley. You'd have the entire mountainside.
And just watch that stuff grow. And no more women carrying buckets of water.
- Sam you're excited.
- Yeah, yeah.
I guess it's been a long time.
- A longtime what?
- Oh, since I was so excited.
And involved.
A long time ago I used to work the land.
I guess I got waylaid somewhere along the line.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
- Forget it. I don't wanna talk about it.
Sam, I'm interested.
Okay, does the name Simon
Causefield mean anything to you?
Causefield...
- Yeah, didn't heà
- That's me.
I remember American
Consolidated Products.
And the thing fell apart. You were gone and the money was too.
I wasn't there because there wasn't any money! And it wasn't my fault!
I'd worked hard and made a little bit.
That little bit became a lot.
So I built a corporation. It became a lot of corporations.
I was a hero.
It was the American dream.
Everybody wanted in.
I did ask them to, nobody told them to buy, they just did.
Overnight the balloon burst.
The next day I'm the biggest crook that the country has ever seen.
I don't know what to do.
So I started running.
Anywhere I think that they won't find me.
That's how I ended up in Baskul.
Maybe here the running can stop.
Maybe.
Samà
I stopped running here, you can too.
Il pleut, il pleut, bergÞre.
Il pleut, il pleut, bergÞre.
Look, uh-uh-uh, I-I don't know a thing about teaching.
- C'mon you're going to have toà
- Mouton.
- Il pleut, il pleut, à
- All you have to do is to follow me.
Come along with me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Catherine has to leave you, so I want to introduce you to your new teacher of the day.
Your new expert Mr. Lovett.
Yea.
Well now, there you are, here
I am, and ah, where are we?
Ah, success. You think that was funny folks,
'You ain't heard nothing yet.'
- Now what are you learning?
- French.
French. Well that lets me out.
'I know nothing about French.'.
A teacher should only teach what he knows at all I know is ah, Show Business
I don't think they'd approve.
You know when I was a kid, the thing that got me was that every teacher I ever had, only ask me questions and expected answers.
You too? Well I'll tell you what I think.
Any dummy can know the answers. It's the smart ones that know the questions.

? If you wanna' know, if you wanna' hear, if you wanna' see, ?
? question me an answer. ?
Harry, what are you doing?
You hear that? They love me!
They love me.
It's beautiful.
It's also inconceivable.
Father Perrault, his story andà
This place hidden away from the rest of the world.
Then you come along and confuse me even more.
- Am I so strange?
- No you're not.
Nothing here is strange.
And that's what's so confusing.
I'm desperately trying to keep myà emotional feedingsà and my spiritual needs from clobbering each other to death.
You're very beautiful.
And very desirable.
But like everything else beautiful that's happened to me here.
I find it remarkable thatà it has happened to me here and not out there.
You know, I can't explain it but, à everything seems familiar.
This air, à
Those beautiful gardens, you,
This lamasery with its feet rooted in a good earth of this fertile valley.
While its head explores the eternal.
And I've been kidnappedà
Brought here against my will which is a crime, a great crime.
And yet I accepted it as, one would accept an act performed by a very dear friend.
Can you tell me why?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm certain there's a, wish for
Shangri-La in everyone's heart.
I've never seen you're outside world but I imagine it's full of millions of people who secretly wish to be in a beautiful place like this.
Well if they were, it wouldn't be beautiful for long.
For years I hoped that someone like you would come and share these moments with me.
But now you're here you're not as I pictured you.
What did you expect?
From your books some uh, Saintly Hero.
Almost astatic.
And much less attractive.
Well, people who worship heroes must be prepared for disillusionment.
But, I shall become saintly immediately.
Just, to please you.
Did you ever thinkà
What did you expect? Or hope?
I imagined she'd be just like you.
I come to youà with all my hopes and
I bring you love.
I come to youà
All my life I searched for something rare.
A love that I could share.
? I come to you with all my dreams and I bring you love. ?
? I come to you. ?
? There were times my faith in life was gone, ?
? still I continued on. ?
? Those endless days turned into years. ?
? They were lonely years in many ways. ?
? And deep inside I'm sure I always knew I had to wait for you. ?
? And here you are, my own true love. ?
? I come to you. ?
? Happy birthday to you ?
? Happy birthday to you ?
? Happy birthday dear Harry ?
? Happy birthday to you ?
Thank you. Thank you my friends.
Old friends.
And new friends.
And a special thank you to Sally for arranging the candles.
Twenty one how'd you guess?
Well, here we go.
Yea.
Well, this is a pretty happy day for me.
Not just because it's my birthday but ah, because I've come to a big decision.
I've decided to stay in Shangri-La.
If they'll have me.
Good that's fine.
Now wait a minute. Hold it.
I hope Mr. Chang that you'll go along with a great idea I've got.
I shall be most interested to hear it Mr. Lovett.
Well Mr. Chang I know
I speak for all of us
I say that ahà this place is terrific.
I don't worry here, and I sleep well.
Confidentially I've had some pretty rough times lately.
Few bookings and audiences wellà
They weren't throwing bread, they sat on their hands.
But ah, these kids hereà
They ah...
They love me.
You know I took a little personal inventory about 10:30 last night, just before going to sleep.
And I said to myself.
"Harry Lovette things are going pretty well for a change."
And they are, so why not go for a run of the play contract. Right?
Well down in school those kids,
Terrific kids you got here Mr. Chang.
They're very imaginative.
They keep imitating me.
Wanting to be like me.
I thought it might be a good idea to give them a course in dramatics.
Teach them to sing and dance, you know sort of that, 'Big Time Stuff.'
But ah, would that be all right with you Mr. Chang?
Can I stay?
Watch it Mr. Chang he's liable to cause chaos in that school.
I don't think so.
We have a saying,
"The trees that bend a little to the harmless breeze, will later grow to withstand the wild wind."
Uh?
We shall be most honored to have you Mr. Lovett.
Oh, great great great.
Now, I'll cut the cake.
Chang!
I wanna' talk with you Mr. Chang.
That famous tribe of porter's expected for two years that will take us all out of here whenever they arrive.
Well, I've just discovered they have arrived, three days ago.
And there was never any intention that they should take us out of here.
Isn't that right Mr. Chang?
I'm going with them Richard.
As for the rest of you well, think about it.
Mr. Conway.
My friend you must not let him go.
The porters could only take him a certain distance.
Beyond that is a wilderness for which he would never get out alive.
You should have told me the porters where here.
I could have prepared him for this.
Talk to him.
I'll try, I don't think he'll listen to me.
Richard.
Richard.
Be careful. He will want you to go with him.
Well.
What shall I do Catherine?
Go and talk to Father Perrault.
Yes, I will.
And I need your help Father, to stop him from leaving.
I am no longer able to help you.
The responsibility is yours.
My sonà
I'm going to die.
I wish to place in your hands, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.
I knew my work was done when
I first set eyes upon you.
I'd been waiting for you for a long time.
I've sat in this room and seen the faces of many newcomers.
I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices.
Always in the hope that I might find you.
It's not an honest task that I bequeathed.
For our order knows no rigid bonds.
To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to reside here in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
It will be such a one my son as the world has not seen before.
There will be no safety by arms.
No help from authority.
No answer in science.
It will rage till every flower of culture is trampled and all human beings are leveled in a loss chaos.
Ask yourself, has it not already begun?
Do you, really believe that I'll live to see the end of the storm?
I do. That is why it is you who must preserve the fragrance of our history and add to it, a touch of your own mind.
You netà
Ià
My vision weakens.
I can see, the great distance.
A new world stirring in the ruins.
Stirring clumsily but in hopefulness.
Seeking its lost and legendary treasures.
They will all be here my son.
Hidden behind the mountains in the Valley Of The Blue Moon.
Preserve in Shangri-La.
I see... my... miracle.
And that's the story.
He said, " I place in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La."
I now know that
I found the answers to all the confusion of the world that has plagued me for a long time.
I found what I'm searching forà
I don't know what to say to you.
Do you really believe everything he told you?
Yes, I do.
Without any proof?
The proof is in the man himself.
In everything I've felt.
Here, from the beginning.
Doesn't the story mean anything to you?
What could it mean to me?
You're right George. This is no place for you.
And you should realize it's no place for you either.
You're needed in the outside world where the problems are far more urgent and pressing than they are here in Shangri-La.
Here, here you just marking time.
Besides think of your obligations to the U.N.
I know the obligations.
I know.
But I've found peace here.
And I've found love.
And I must hold on to it.
I'm going to pack and see to the others.
Richard, I beg you to think again.
And change your mind.
George, I'm staying.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I shall miss you. So will a lot of other people.
So you won't be lonely, I've talked to the rest of them.
They're staying too.
So it'll be just Maria and me.
Maria, what she got to do with it?
She's coming with me.
- You can't take her away.
- Why not?
Don't you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La?
She'll begin to live the happiest part of her life. That's what will happen.
She'll begin to live the last moments of her life.
Her beauty isà
She must stay here where she's safe.
She's young and strong, she'll manage the trip all right.
George listen, she can't make that trip.
She's not young and strong. Chang told me that she came here, à
80 years ago.
Eighty?
What are you talking about?
Oh come on Richard, you can't believe that.
You've seen her, she's not a day over 20.
Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
I see. And what if she leaves Shangri-La?
Chang said she would quickly revert to her actual age.
And you must believe it.
Look, will you believe me if I prove you're wrong?
And will you then see that, if I'm right about Maria,
I'm probably right about the rest too.
I'll die if I have to stay here alone now.
George promised he wouldn't leave me.
If it weren't for me you'd never get out.
It was I who bribed the porters.
They were forbidden by the High
Lama to take any one out of here.
- Is it true?
- I was with her.
They only took the bribe because he's dead now.
But aren't you afraid to leave? You know what will happen if you go.
Happen?
Ah, I suppose Chang told you that I am old.
That is part of the myth of Shangri-La.
Chang did tell you didn't he.
Yes.
Look at me Mr. Conway,
Do I look like an old woman?
Is this the skin of an old woman?
Are these the eyes of an old woman?
And in my heart, are these the feedings of an old woman?
Do you believe I have been here for 80 years?
Like us, she was kidnapped.
They brought her here just two years ago.
Well I don't believe it. I can't believe it. She's lying.
You're lying every word you said is a lie.
Now come on admit it.
What reason would
I have for lying?
Look Mr. Conway, the chances are, we will never live through this terrible journey.
But, I would rather go out there with George, and die in a snowstorm than stay here one minute more.
But why have they told me this story!
Because they need you here.
Sally and the others have already found ways to be useful,
But you're the one they were after, you had to be convinced.
But your job isn't here and you must realize that now.
Are you telling me the truth?
I am 20 years old and I was brought here two years ago.
I'm going to need your help on this journey.
We both are.
Please come with us Richard.
I believe her.
Humph.
I once said to Chang that I was afraid this was a dream from which I might suddenly and unhappily awake.
All right, I'll come with you.
Catherine!
Catherine?
To Len.
- Yes Mr. Conway.
- Where's Catherine?
Chang has given orders that she cannot be disturbed.
But where is she,
I must see her.
I regret that is not possible Mr. Conway.
Richard! Richard come on.
I can't find Catherine.
I'm sorry, but the porters won't wait.
Richard, the porters won't wait.
I hope they make it.
Doesn't tempt you, does it Harry?
Not me Sam.
We can still go with them if you want to.
What's happened?
Where's Richard?
He's leaving my child.
- Leaving?!
- But, he will return.
Richard!
Richard!
Richard.
Richard, hurry!
Richard!
Richard!
Richard!
Richard.
[Hundunn!]
Can't you get them to wait.
They're leaving us father behind everyday.
They're only trying to save themselves.
We're too slow.
I am sorry. I cannot go faster.
I cannot move faster.
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!
[Hoodelee]
Aahh!
Richard.
Help me.
I must rest. I cannot go on any longer.
I must rest!
I'll carry her.
Richard? Richard!
Richard, her-her face!
Look at her face!
There's a cave over there.
Help me.
There.
Ugh.
No!
No!
- Oh no!
- George!
No no!
- George!
- No!
Aaaahh!
Aah!
Doctor.
How are you Mr. Conway?
I dreamt for a moment that I was back again.
Back again? Where?
Where?
How are you feeling?
I don't know whether I've been mad, and now sane or,
I was sane for a time and now mad again.
Mr. Conway.
How do you know my name?
The whole world knows your name and wonders what happened to you?
You were flying back from a U.N. peace mission when your plane disappeared.
Peace mission.
- Did we succeeded?
- Sadly no.
But there's always hope.
Yes hope.
It must be that.
Mr. Ferguson, I'm Dr. Verden.
I told Conway you're coming.
- Oh good. This is my associate Theo Murphy.
- How do you do.
- Dr..
- Please come with me.
Follow me.
When the tribesmen found him wandering in the lower valley, he was totally lost.
Suffering from snow blindness and near starvation.
Despite this, they had a hard time getting him to the village.
So keen was he to get back into the mountains.
To get to this place called Shangri-La.
Shangri-La. Yes, that was in your report.
- But do you think...?
- You'll hear about it from him.
Come.
Where he is he?
I'm afraid you arrived too late.
He's gone.
Gone?
Shangri-La.
On and on he talked about this fantastic place.
He must return. He must return!
Obviously right now that's what he's trying to do.
But I've got to find him.
It's my job to take him home.
Your job won't be easy Mr. Ferguson, even if you do find him.
This, obsession if you will, kept him alive in the wilderness, beyond all human endurance.
Even here his convalescence is do less to medicine, than to that, all consuming passion to return.
In Richard Conway's mind,
Shangri-La represents the ultimate way of life.
It's ah, Shangri-La.
Do you believe it?
Yes, I believe it.
I believe it, because
I want to believe it.

"In the decade of the 1930s even the great city of Metropolis...
"... was not spared the ravages of the worldwide depression.
"In the times of fear and confusion...
"... the job of informing the public was the responsibility...
"... of the Daily Planet.
"A great metropolitan newspaper...
"... whose reputation for clarity and truth had become a symbol of hope...
"... for the city of Metropolis."
This is no fantasy.
No careless product of wild imagination.
No, my good friends...
...these indictments...
...I've brought you today...
...specific charges listed herein against the individuals...
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.
These...
...are matters of undeniable fact.
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...
...on those accused.
On this...
...this mindless aberration...
...whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction.
On the woman, Ursa...
...whose perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...
...have threatened even the children of the Planet Krypton.
Finally, General Zod.
Once trusted by this Council...
...charged with maintaining the defense of the Planet Krypton itself.
Chief Architect of this intended revolution and author of this insidious plot...
...to establish a new order amongst us...
...with himself as absolute ruler.
You have heard the evidence.
The decision of the Council will now be heard.
Guilty!
Guilty!
Guilty!
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.
It has therefore now become your decision.
You alone will condemn us if you wish...
...and you alone will be held responsible by me!
Join us!
You have been known to disagree with the Council before.
Yours could become an important voice in the new order, second only to my own!
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!
Take it! Join us!
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!
You will bow down before me!
Both you and then one day...
...your heirs!
Forgive me, forgive me...
An unpleasant duty has been masterly performed, Jor-El.
They have received the fate they deserved.
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...
...an eternal living death.
A chance for life, nonetheless.
As opposed to us.
It's suicide.
No, it's worse, it's genocide.
Be warned, Jor-El.
The Council has already evaluated this outlandish theory of yours.
My friends, you know me to be neither rash nor impulsive.
I am not given to wild unsupported statements...
...and I tell you that we must evacuate this planet immediately.
Jor-El, you are one of Krypton's greatest scientists.
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.
I don't question your data.
The facts are undeniable.
It's your conclusions we find unsupportable.
This planet will explode within 30 days.
If not sooner.
I tell you Krypton is simply shifting its orbit.
Jor-El...
...be reasonable.
My friend...
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.
This discussion is terminated.
The decision of the Council is final.
Any attempt by you to create...
...a climate of fear and panic among the populace...
...must be deemed by us an act of insurrection.
You would accuse me of insurrection?
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?
You would be banished to endless imprisonment...
...in the Phantom Zone:
The eternal void...
...which you, yourself discovered.
Will you abide by the Council's decision?
I will remain silent.
Neither I, nor my wife...
...will leave Krypton.
Have you finished?
Nearly.
It's the only answer, Lara.
If he remains here with us...
...he will die as surely as we will.
But why Earth, Jor-El?
They're primitives, thousands of years behind us.
He will need that advantage to survive.
Their atmosphere will...
...sustain him.
He will defy their gravity.
He will look like one of them.
He won't be one of them.
No.
His dense molecular structure will make him strong.
He'll be odd. Different.
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.
Isolated. Alone.
He will not be alone.
He will never be alone.
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters is now in excess.
Our data indicates the loss is due to a misuse of energy.
Investigate.
And if the investigation proves correct?
He knew the penalty he faced.
He even is a member of this Council.
The law will be upheld.
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.
But we will never leave you.
Even in the face of our death...
...the richness of our lives...
...shall be yours.
All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel...
...all this and more, I...
...I bequeath you, my son.
You will carry me inside you...
...all the days of your life.
You will make my strength your own...
...see my life through your eyes...
...as your life will be seen through mine.
The son becomes the father, and the father...
...the son.
This is all I...
...all I can send you, Kal-El.
...which Einstein called his theory of relativity.
Embedded in the crystals before you...
...is the total accumulation of all literature and scientific fact from dozens...
...of other worlds...
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.
Early Chinese writings point out the complex relationship...
By carrying this complex equation to its ultimate power, my son...
Chief among these powers will be your sight...
...your strength, your hearing...
...your ability to propel yourself at almost limitless speed.
The early history of our universe was a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.
Each of the six galaxies which you will pass through...
...contain their own individual law of space and time.
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.
- What!
- What was that?
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...
Oh, Pa!
Oh, my.
All these years, as happy as we've been...
...how I've prayed the good Lord would see fit to give us a child.
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.
You take things easy now.
Remember what Doc Frye said about that heart of yours.
Now the first thing we've got to do when we get home is find out...
...who that boy's proper family is.
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.
Are you thinking what I think you are thinking?
We could say he's the child of my cousin in North Dakota...
...and just now orphaned.
Jonathan, he's only a baby.
Martha, now you saw how we found him.
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening to what I'm saying?
Come on, gang.
That was a great game.
All right.
Come on, hustle, let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.
Remember about the uniforms, cleaned and washed...
...by tomorrow, and looking like a football team.
Let's have those clothes washed and ready for tomorrow's game.
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.
Can you give me a lift?
Lana?
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up to Mary Ellen's.
Play some records.
Would you like to come?
Sure.
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...
All that?
Oh, Brad!
Hey, come on, Lana.
Come on, let's go.
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.
'Bye, Clark.
'Bye, Clark.
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.
Golly! I saw a boy out there run as fast as the train!
Faster, even!
Lois Lane, you have a writer's gift for invention.
- I'll say that for you.
- But...
Lois, please read your book.
No one ever believes me.
Hey, look, there's Clark!
Clark?
How did you get here so fast?
I ran.
Ran, huh?
Told you he was an oddball, let's get out of here.
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
Yeah, I know you can do all these amazing things...
...and sometimes you think that you will just go bust...
...unless you can tell people about it.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.
- That's for sure.
- Every time.
Is it showing off when somebody's doing the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?
No, now, you listen to me.
When you came to us, we thought...
...people would take you away...
...when they found out the things that you do.
It worried us a lot.
Then when a man gets older and he thinks very differently.
And things get very clear.
And there's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.
I don't know whose reason, or whatever the reason is...
...maybe it's because...
I don't know.
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll race you to it. Yeah.
You will?
Run. Come on, come on. Move, move.
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.
Jonathan!
Dad.
All those things I can do...
...all those powers...
...and I couldn't even save him.
Clark, get up.
Good morning, Smiley.
Clark, breakfast.
Are you going to sleep all day?
Clark, come on. Get up.
I have to leave.
I knew this time would come.
We both knew it from the day we found you.
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.
He said that he'd be happy to help out from now on.
Mother!
I know, Son.
I know.
Do you know where you're headed?
North.
Remember us, Son.
Always remember us.
My son...
...you do not remember me.
I am Jor-El.
I am your father.
By now you will have reached your eighteenth year...
...as it is measured on Earth.
By that reckoning...
...I will have been dead for many thousands of your years.
The knowledge...
...that I have of matters, physical and historical...
...I have given you fully on your voyage to your new home.
These are important matters to be sure...
...but still matters of mere fact.
There are questions to be asked...
...and it is time for you to do so.
Here, in this...
...this fortress of solitude...
...we shall try to find the answers together.
So, my son...
...speak.
Who am I?
Your name is Kal-El.
You are the only survivor of the Planet Krypton.
Even though you were raised as a human, you are not one of them.
You have great powers, only some of which you have...
...as yet discovered.
Come with me now, my son...
...as we break through the bars of your earthly confinement.
Traveling through time and space.
Your powers will far exceed those of mortal men.
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.
Rather let your leadership stir others to.
In the next year, we shall examine the human heart.
It is more fragile than your own.
As we pass through the flaming turmoil which is the edge of your own galaxy...
...we will enter the realm of the red Krypton sun...
...source of your strength and nourishment...
...and cause of our eventual destruction.
The Planet Krypton, my son...
...your home as it was.
This year we shall examine the various concepts of immortality...
...and their basis in actual fact.
The total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies...
...is embedded in the crystals which I have sent along with you.
Study them well, my son.
By the time you return to the confines of your galaxy...
...twelve of your years will have passed.
For this reason, among others...
...I have chosen Earth for you.
It is now time for you to rejoin your new world...
...and to serve its collective humanity.
Live as one of them, Kal-El...
...and discover where your strength and your power are needed.
But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage.
They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be.
They only lack the light to show the way.
For this reason, above all, their capacity for good...
...I have sent them you...
...my only son.
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
Smile.
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?
Two.
What are you writing?
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?
M- a-s-s-a-c-r-e.
Thanks.
Golly, how come you get all the great stories?
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.
A good reporter makes them great.
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.
The way I see it, it's a headline on the front page with my picture...
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.
So does a lady wrestler with a foreign accent.
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.
This could be the basis for a series of articles:
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings" by Lois Lane.
We get psychologists, sociologists, interviews...
Lois, you're pushing a bunch of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.
The Daily Planet has a tradition...
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shake it up like that.
Of course not, Lois.
Why would any one want to make a total stranger look like a fool?
I'll take that.
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.
And don't call me sugar.
Right... Sugar.
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.
Lois, why don't you take Kent out to meet everybody, huh?
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.
I'm giving him the City beat.
Chief!
That's my beat!
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just a mild-mannered reporter...
...but not only does he know how to treat his Chief with the proper respect...
...not only does he have a snappy, punchy prose style...
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business, the fastest typist I've ever seen.
That's great.
Here, you forgot my article.
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...
...if you could arrange for half my salary...
...to be sent to this address on a weekly basis.
Your bookie, right?
My what?
Don't tell me!
He sends a check every week to his sweet, gray-haired mother.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you very much, Mr. White.
Well?
Any more at home like you?
Not really, no.
I didn't think so.
Well, get yourself a desk over here.
Over here?
Here, there's some paper and a file right there.
Sorry.
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.
- What?
- Kent.
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.
I haven't been since I was seven.
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.
How did you like your first day on the job?
The hours were sort of longer than I expected...
...but on the whole, meeting you and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.
- "Swell"?
- Yup.
You know, Clark...
...there are very few people left in the world...
...who feel comfortable saying that word.
- What word?
- Swell.
Really? I always thought it was kind of natural.
- Sorry.
- Clark.
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.
Rex, this is...
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you...
Lois?
Hey, where you going?
Can I help you with your coat?
- Thanks, can you get that?
- Sure.
Did you like Mr. White?
He was a nice guy and Jimmy was fantastic.
Come here. Come on.
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.
We'd better get out of here.
We'd better do what he says, Lois.
Come on, get in here, quick.
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.
We're coming.
Excuse me.
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.
Okay, okay. Hold it there.
Just a minute.
Now I realize that...
...times are tough for some these days, but this isn't the answer.
You can't solve society's problems with a gun.
You know, buddy, you're right.
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you. That's the spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
Of course!
Now come on, lady, hand it over.
Lois, I think you'd better...
Lois! What are you doing?
Are you all right?
What happened?
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.
Really, Lois, supposing that man had shot you?
Is it worth risking your life over $10...
...two credit cards, a hairbrush and a lipstick?
- How did you know that?
- Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Wild guess.
Taxi!
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.
So, what's happening, partner?
Look what we got.
Let's take him.
Wait a minute.
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.
Lex Luthor?
You got it, Aramus.
We'll make Captain by midnight.
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.
Hey, what do you read?
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.
Just getting a Daily Planet here.
Okay. All right.
See, I'm paying him, and I got a pretzel, too.
Thanks, Otis.
How many bags, Shutzy?
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.
Let's go.
Your attention, please.
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready for departure...
...on the upper level. Track 6.
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?
All right, Aramus. All right.
Now boarding on the lower level...
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...
Board now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation to Buffalo, Syracuse...
Smoking cars are forward, move along now.
Luggage at the top.
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.
So that's it!
It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to keep those legs moving.
Harry...
Harry, where are you? Harry?
Sick!
Sick, you're really sick!
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?
Sick when we're days from executing the crime of the century?
No. Step away from that, please.
How do you choose to congratulate the greatest criminal mind of our time?
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.
Charismatic?
Fiendishly gifted?
Try twisted!
Get away from that, get away!
Tell me, Lex.
Why do so many people have to die for the crime of the century?
Why? You ask why?
Why does the phone always ring when you're in the bathtub?
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader of our time...
...surrounding himself with total nincompoops?
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.
I was just talking about you.
You were followed again.
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?
Yes.
Then why am I not reading it?
Because I haven't given it to you yet?
Right.
At last it's official.
Thanks to the help of the US Government...
...we are about to be involved in the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.
Lex, what is this...
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."
When I was 6 years old, my father said to me...
"Get out! "
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...
"... utilities and transportation systems may collapse...
"... people are no damn good, but they'll always need land...
"... they'll pay through the nose to get it."
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."
It's a pity that he didn't see...
...from such humble beginnings how I've created this empire.
An empire. This?
How many girls do you know have a Park Avenue address like this?
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?
Do you realize what people are shelling out up there...
...for a few miserable rooms off a common elevator.
What more could anyone ask?
Get this Loch Ness update right into composing.
Yeah, no that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed, right.
Why are you standing here for?
I'm not.
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.
The sex maniac profile.
Right. Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.
Hi, Clark. Good night.
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.
Lois, have you got a minute?
Excuse me, please.
And these two go to the addresses on the envelope, okay?
I was wondering if you'd have dinner with me?
I'm sorry, I'm booked.
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...
...you-know-who answers the questions he would rather duck.
Don't you ever let up?
What for? I mean I've seen how the other half lives.
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.
I would go bananas in a week.
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.
Maybe we could...
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.
Good night.
Going down, please, going down.
Going down?
Going up. Up, up.
Good night.
Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.
Planet One, go ahead.
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.
We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.
Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.
Roger, Over and out.
A malfunction, can't get lift off.
- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?
Set it down.
My God, we've lost motor control.
I can't hold it.
I can't hold it.
He's lost it.
Wake up.
Help!
Step back, folks.
Get back. Move over to the other side of the street.
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.
There's a helicopter up there.
Help me.
All right, folks. Let's move back.
Let these firemen get in here.
Help me!
Hold it. Get back.
Get off the street, folks.
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.
Hold these crowds back. Move.
Help!
Say, Jim...
Excuse me.
That's a bad outfit.
Okay, move these people.
My God! Look up there.
What the hell's that?
Easy, miss. I've got you.
You've got me? Who's got you?
I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.
Gentlemen, this man needs help.
I hope this little incident hasn't put you off flying, miss.
Statistically speaking, of course, it's still the safest way to travel.
Right.
Wait!
Who are you?
A friend.
'Bye.
Something wrong with the elevator?
Going down?
Officer.
Good evening, Officer Mooney.
They say confession is good for the soul.
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Move your ass! Come on!
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.
Bad vibrations?
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.
With a big red cape and bright red boots as well.
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!
With bright red boots?
Take the night off.
Go back to Murphy's bar and continue what you started.
I'll be off in a few minutes and I'll meet you there.
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.
Frisky, will you come down from there.
Hi. I'll get him.
Come on, it's all right.
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.
'Bye.
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.
Then this man swooped out of the sky and gave him to me.
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?
Metropolis currently ceiling 500, overcast 700 broken...
...visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.
Roger.
Doesn't look good. What do you think?
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.
Bring up two and three.
We haven't got enough pressure to keep going.
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.
We have lost port outboard engine and part of wing.
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.
Notify them the President's on board.
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?
What the hell's going on out there?
Fly, don't look, just fly.
We got something.
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.
You enjoyed it.
I don't know what to say, Father.
I'm afraid I just got carried away.
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.
You couldn't have imagined...
How good it felt?
You are revealed to the world.
Very well.
So be it.
But you still must keep your secret identity.
Why?
The reasons are two.
First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.
As it is, in earth time.
Your help will be called for endlessly.
Even for those tasks that human beings can solve themselves.
It's their habit to abuse their resources in such a way.
And secondly?
Secondly:
Your enemies will discover...
...their only way to hurt you...
...by hurting the people you care for.
Thank you, Father.
Lastly:
Do not punish yourself with your feelings of vanity.
Simply learn to control them.
It is an affliction common to all, even on Krypton.
Our destruction could have been avoided but for the vanity of some...
...who considered us indestructible.
Were it not for vanity...
...at this very moment...
...I could embrace you in my arms...
...my son.
Reports are coming in of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...
...from almost certain destruction...
...rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter from the Daily Planet, with one hand...
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.
That'll be the day.
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.
I don't know. You would be surprised.
...some sort of fantastic hoax.
Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?
Miracle or fraud? The answer...
- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?
Turn it off.
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?
If he is, he's not from this world.
Why?
If any human being was gonna perpetrate such a hoax, it would have been me!
My robe.
Right away, Mr. Luthor.
It all fits somehow, this coming here to Metropolis...
...and at this particular time.
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.
To commit the crime of the century, a man wants to face the challenge of the century.
Listen, maybe this guy that flies is just sort of passing through.
Passing through?
Not on your life, Otis...
...which I would gladly sacrifice by the way...
...for the opportunity of destroying everything that he represents.
And, Otis, by the way, next time put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.
Now look.
The Post, "It Flies."
The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."
The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."
The Planet. We're sitting on top of the story of the century here.
I want the name of this flying whatchamacallit...
...to go with the Daily Planet like bacon and eggs...
...franks and beans, death and taxes, politics and corruption.
I don't think that he'd...
...lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes.
Exactly how would you know that?
Just first impression.
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.
- Right?
- Right, Chief.
I want the real story.
I want the inside dope on this guy.
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?
Why did he show up last night?
Where does he come from?
Does he have a girlfriend?
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?
Now listen to me, I tell you, boys and girls...
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...
...is going to wind up with the single, most important interview since...
...God talked to Moses!
What are you standing around about for?
Move!
Get on that story.
"8:00," he said. Some friend!
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust! "
Good evening, Miss Lane.
Did you have plans this evening?
This old thing? No.
- I could come back later.
- No!
Don't move.
Sure you can move.
Just don't fly away, all right?
Sorry to drop in on you like this, but I've been thinking.
There must be some questions people'd like to know the answers to.
Yes.
You really shouldn't smoke.
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?
Well, not yet, thank goodness.
Would you like a glass of wine?
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.
Nice place.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Shall we get started with the interview?
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?
No, I'm not.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, I don't. But...
If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.
How old are you?
Over 21.
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.
And how big are you? How tall are you?
About 6' 4".
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?
Around 225.
I assume then that...
...the rest of your bodily functions are normal?
I beg your pardon?
Well, putting it delicately...
...do you...
...eat?
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.
You do. Of course, you do.
Well, then is it true...
...that you can see through anything?
Yes, I can, pretty much.
And that you're totally impervious to pain?
Well, so far.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Did I embarrass you?
- No.
- I did.
No, it's just that this planter must be made of lead.
Yes, it is. So?
I sort of have a problem seeing through lead.
That's interesting.
Problems with lead.
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.
Pink!
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.
You didn't embarrass me.
What's your background?
Where are you from?
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.
Krypton.
Cripton! With a C-r-i...
No, actually it's Krypton, with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n.
Do you like pink?
I like pink very much.
Why are you?
Sorry?
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice and the American way.
You'll end up fighting every official in this country.
You don't really mean that.
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?
I never lie.
How fast do you fly, by the way?
I don't know. I've never actually bothered to time myself.
Say?
Why don't we find out?
And how do you propose we do that?
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- Are you serious?
- Sure.
Don't you want to go?
You won't need these.
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.
Ready?
Clark said that you were just a figment of somebody's imagination.
Like Peter Pan.
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.
Can you read my mind?
Do you know what it is that you do to me?
I don't know who you are.
Just a friend from another star.
Here I am, like a kid out of school.
Holding hands with a god.
I'm a fool.
Will you look at me?
Quivering.
Like a little girl shivering.
You can see right through me.
Can you read my mind?
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?
Wondering why you are...
...all the wonderful things you are.
You can fly.
You belong in the sky.
You and I...
...could belong to each other.
If you need a friend...
...I'm the one to fly to.
If you need to be loved...
...here I am.
Read my mind.
We forgot to time ourselves.
Maybe next time.
You okay?
Good night.
Good night.
What a super man!
Superman!
Anybody home?
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.
For goodness' sake, didn't you hear me knocking?
We did have a date tonight, remember?
You haven't been...?
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.
I mean, I need a purse, and I have to fix my hair...
...put some blush on.
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...
I was at first really nervous about tonight.
But then I decided, darn it, I was going to show you the time of your life.
That's Clark nice.
We could go for a hamburger or whatever you want to do.
Now then...
...given the exact location of the galaxy that he mentions...
...and the proximity to our own solar system...
It's amazing. Amazing!
Too good to be true.
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...
...doesn't drink or smoke and tells the truth.
Some people can read War and Peace...
...and think it was an adventure story.
Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper...
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe?
Right, Miss Teschmacher.
"N."
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.
So there you go, "M."
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...
..."nincompoop," "nitwit," and "L" as in "ladder."
Here's a ladder, coming right up.
I didn't see...
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.
In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton...
...exploded in 1948.
That ridiculous little freak...
...took three years in a rocket to get to earth.
- Ergo...
- Ergo.
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.
He's 6' 4", you know that?
Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me?
It's your weight and my I.Q.
Think, people, think.
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...
...exploded and went into outer space.
It is reasonable to assume...
...that some of those particles of debris drifted to Earth.
Meteorites!
Jawohl.
Voilà!
Voilà!
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?
I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but...
...so what?
So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites.
Fair enough.
But the level of specific radioactivity...
...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton...
...this substance is lethal.
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...
...but this stuff here...
...will kill him.
Doesn't it give you a kind of...
...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me?
Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him.
He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his.
O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see...
...nor can Superman, through lead.
He can't see through lead?
And Kryptonite will destroy him.
Any questions, class?
I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?
Looks like a burnoose.
It's just a wraparound.
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.
Everything looks good, see you at the base. Over and out.
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.
Look at this!
Looks pretty bad.
Take her pulse.
Get an ambulance down here.
I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to.
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.
Yes, sir!
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.
Get an ambulance.
Gather around.
Turn around!
Hi.
Somebody hurt?
I did it, Mr. Luthor.
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?
I set the first directional vector...
...to 38.
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.
What about the fourth one?
What fourth one?
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!
The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7.
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.
Would you like to see a long arm?
Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm?
No, Mr. Luthor.
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.
I thought you told me this road would be blocked off?
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.
All right. Follow me, men.
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.
This man is a diabetic, you see.
As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam...
...but what I don't understand...
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met?
You don't know his name.
At the stupid high price he offered...
...for this worthless piece of desert...
...I hope it's Custer!
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.
Reporting live from the launch site, ground zero.
Today marks a historic occasion since...
...two XK-101 rockets will be launched simultaneously.
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?
No, but the Chief wants to see you.
You're blocking the set, Clark.
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?
Good.
Excuse me, Mr. White.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?
She's out West, looking into a land-fraud deal.
I sent young Olsen with her on his first assignment.
Some unidentified clown is buying thousands of acres...
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.
That doesn't seem to make sense.
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.
People break into a museum at night, kill two people, and what do they take?
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?
I've never been able to understand violence.
I know that about you.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...
...and I got where I am with guts, compassion...
...elbow grease and something you're sadly lacking in, son.
Humility?
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.
This is Lex Luthor.
Only one thing alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency.
That's you.
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet containing propane lithium compound...
...will be released through thousands of air ducts in this city...
...effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis.
I was a reporter before most of my friends were copy boys.
I want you to get Lois to introduce you to Superman.
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?
I know it all seems a bit much...
...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?
I knew you'd never accept an invitation to tea.
But a disaster, with people in danger, people who need help...
I just knew you couldn't resist that chance to sort of pitch in.
You know what I mean?
There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.
But then nobody's perfect.
Almost nobody.
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.
Tell me what you see?
Cuteness, dimples.
You like cuteness?
Dimples.
I'll give you dimples.
The pressure is still on you.
You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...
...get out of the tunnel.
It's your last chance, Superman.
Why don't you do yourself a flavor and freeze.
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.
He's definitely coming.
It's open, come in.
My attorney will be in touch with you about the damage to the door.
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.
I don't think he wants me to.
Where's the gas pellet?
Somewhere.
It's in the back of my mind, actually.
It's a little idea I was toying with.
Is that how a warped brain like yours gets its kicks?
By planning the death of innocent people?
By causing the death of innocent people.
Fire!
Navy Bird, we have a good launch.
Navy missile...
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...
...very heavy into real estate.
To make money, you have to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?
Right.
So, the problem?
How to make the land more valuable between the time you buy it...
...and the time you sell it?
Now this is California.
The richest, most populous state in the Union.
I don't need a geography lesson from you.
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?
Where was I?
- California.
- California, right.
The San Andreas Fault, maybe you've heard of it?
Yes. It's the joining together of two land masses.
The fault line is shifting, which is why you get earthquakes in California.
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Everything west of this line is the richest, most expensive real estate in the world.
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.
Everything on this side of the line...
...is just hundreds of miles of worthless desert land...
...which just happens to be owned by...
Lex Luthor Incorporated.
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...
...planted at just the proper point would...
Would destroy most of California.
Millions of people would be killed and the West Coast as we know it would...
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.
"Otisburg"?
Miss Teschmacher, she's got her own place.
"Otisburg"?
It's a little bitty place.
Otisburg?
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.
I'll admit there were a few problems.
Adjusting the precise trajectory of the missile.
Finding the optimum stress point for the fault line itself...
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...
...here.
That's impossible!
What's happening, Lieutenant?
Trajectory malfunction, sir.
Abort.
All counter control units...
...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.
Function negative, sir.
Can't you knock them down?
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.
Get me the Pentagon.
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.
Would you go to the viewing room, please?
But as for the rest, it's nothing but a sick fantasy.
Fantasy?
No.
It's history. It's happening, Superman.
Miss Teschmacher!
Yes, Lex?
Where's the rocket now?
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon, so is the other one.
The other one?
There are two of them?
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.
Even you, with your great speed, couldn't stop both of them.
While I, on the other hand, could stop them with my detonator.
All right, Luthor, where is it?
Where's the detonator?
Diseased maniac!
Do you think you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead?
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.
Don't touch that.
I told you.
It's Kryptonite.
A little souvenir from your hometown.
I've spared no expense to make you feel at home.
You were great in your day.
But it just stands to reason...
...when it came time to cash in your chips...
...this old diseased maniac would be your banker.
Mind over muscle.
You don't even care where the other missile's headed, do you?
Certainly I do.
I know exactly where it's headed.
Hackensack, New Jersey.
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.
Mine's in California.
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.
Please, you can't...
...you can't just stand there.
You can't just stand and let millions of innocent people die.
Maybe.
Please, help me to save them.
Would you promise to save my mother first?
But, Lois, and Jimmy...
But my mother comes first.
If you promise, I'll believe you because you always tell the truth.
I promise, I promise.
Why did you kiss me first?
I didn't think you'd let me later.
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.
Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys?
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.
Army Bird still heading due east.
Navy Bird still heading due west.
Losing radar contact.
Next radar contact after three seconds.
Army Bird still headed east, sir.
Army Bird gaining altitude.
Miss Teschmacher!
Radar contact strong.
Miss Teschmacher!
Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.
Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.
15 seconds and counting.
A military missile has exploded in the Southern California desert.
The force of the explosion has activated the San Andreas fault.
California is suffering a major earthquake.
What's going on?
It's a quake! Look!
Okay, kids, it's all right now.
Hey, it's Superman!
Holy mackerel!
We're going off the tracks.
All personnel evacuate dam.
Watch that cable!
Someone try and pull the main.
It's impossible. It's red hot!
Is that man all right?
Yeah.
Hang on, Jim.
The dam broke.
You're safe here, son.
That's okay. Miss Lane will be driving by any minute.
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.
There has been major quake damage to Southern California.
The San Andreas fault has miraculously sealed itself.
Yet Southern California is suffering an aftershock of a major earthquake.
The population is still warned to be aware...
Please, come on, turn over.
Come on!
Help me. Help me, please.
It is forbidden for you to interfere...
There's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.
It is forbidden.
All those things I can do.
All those powers...
...but I couldn't even save him.
It is forbidden.
Hi.
Don't bother, it's dead.
Sure it's dead.
The problem with men of steel is they're never around when you want one.
Do you know what happened while you were off flying around?
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.
To top the whole thing off, this stupid car runs out of gas.
I'm sorry about that, Lois.
But I've been kind of busy for a while.
I'm sorry, that's all right.
Thanks a lot, Superman.
Put me in the middle of nowhere during an earthquake.
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.
He can't stay still for a second.
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...
Clark... Wait a minute.
What?
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.
But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...
You're messing up my suit!
Otis! Watch the ground, you...
Good evening, Warden.
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.
Who is it, Superman?
Lex Luthor.
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.
...that these walls...
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!
You, you nitwit!
Nincompoop!
This country...
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.
No, sir.
Don't thank me, Warden.
We're all part of the same team.
Good night.
Look at the mulatto!
Look at the mulatto!
He's dead!
Vadiño!
Vadiño My Brother
What happened to you Vadiño?
You must be wrong
Check him again
Vadiño!
Debi bet on a chip the number 17
He liked the roulette
This was his preferred drawer
I did manage to bring it personally
The boy felt so much he liked a lot Vadiño
We were like brothers
Insurance?
Never used
He sold it on the eve of wedding to play cards
He had a dream of being rich
Majinca, is it true that he will stand by Dona Flor?
Watch your ...
Water, for the people
Sofia, brings sweets
Not only beat her, he also spent her money playing cards
What a shame
Pitanga, liquor or cachacita?
A liquor
In the end
What was the cause of death,
Mrs. Norma?
What did he die of?
Ah, it was not just one cause, there were many causes
Liver unusable damaged kidneys heart undermined lung ...
Life is cruel
True
You know, I was a close friend of Vadiño
Well, when I learned of his misfortune
I wrote verses spontaneously shaped as a modern elegy
His death was a tragedy
Dona Florípides, accept my sincerest condolences
Thank you
And count on me for whatever you need
There will never be another so intimate with the wine, dice and whores
They are mourning him,the players at the Black Bar
A minute's silence at all ruletas
Flags fly high on the masts of the castles
Colas desperate ...
Daughter of mine, come to sit a bit
You have already suffered greatly at his hands.
Try to find peace
I'm fine, Mom
You have seen Vadiño in a rage, huh?
He was a vagabond, cachacero and gigoló
All so much so?
And much more. Embustero, liar, gambler
And why?, Get over yourself in my family
He turned his head to my daughter
And made her home unhappy to live in
He is dead, Mrs. Rozilda
How can you talk this way?
I cried a lot when Flor ran off to marry 7 years ago
Seven years? 
Yes seven years
But now I can breathe again
I want back my daughter
All this for your understanding that in life lived for his friends
Peace, love and happiness for him in his holy peace, amen
God almighty, so decides
And pray for him in her womb receives our brother Valdomiro
And living in peace away from all sins. Amen
In the name of father, son and
Holy Spirit
Excuse me, excuse me please
Your husband was a good kind man
I brought you some tea
Thanks but I do not want it
I did not ask if you want it.
You will drink it
Pleae accept, my daughter
Take it. It will be good for you
Take a little more
Guisado crab was the preferred dish of Vadiño
Wash oysters whole lemon juice
Wash enough to remove dirt from the sea
One by one, place the oysters in the pan but slowly they are very sensitive
Choose four tomatoes, paprika, an onion and place it into slices to give decorative touch when everything is cooked add the coconut oil and dende oil
Serve hot as ever served
His teeth chewed the soft oysters, his lips were yellow and soft
Never again your lips, your tongue
Never again your horrible onion breath
What is it baby?
Is this our first time?
Is this shameful?
Sex is something
God himself ordered go around my children have sex and make children
If God does not want people to have sex
He would have castrated all the people
Ah ... do Vadiño
Ah, my desnudita
What crazy thing more and more beautiful
Vadiño
Vadiño
I played three ...
Look, if I didn't see it with my own eyes I wouldn't believe it
The day of the wedding!
This is crazy Vadiño
But it is a good form of crazy
Oh, my god, how are these hours?
One moment, it is
Vadiño!
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
The surprise, surprise
We have a gift for you
Vadiño
We were going to give it to you at your bachelor party
But this Zafar said that never came
Vadiño not involved in farewells
Vadiño never says goodbye
Here it is good form, good form, good type
We all want you and your wife to be very, very, very happy
A little spice of the kingdom
Salt only a little, how they saw? four tomatoes
Without skin?
Yes, no skin and no stone is very important
And malagueta pepper to taste
Now clean shrimp will be mixed add the oil to the other ingredients
The quibebe shrimp is a dish that tends to please every palate
But do not believe that it is easy to do
You must concentrate or it will be a disaster
Let's talk about our next dish
We have to make a sarapatel
List all the ingredients you must have
Menudos pork, beef or goat a sheet of parrot three branches of coriander
Kingdom of pepper two teeth of clove an onion, garlic soup and loaves of animal blood

This crab sauce is your masterpiece

Yes, my love, of course

The water is already boiled
I cannot, I'm late. I have a very important appointment
Come back soon
A client for you
Heaven will have to squeeze in one more person
What comes after death?
You die you sleep and nothing else
I'm sleepy ...
I bet 500 the client is a man
Respect for the dream of death
I bet 500 it is a woman's corpse
700, a woman's corpse
Is it man or woman?
What?
The body, is it man or woman?
His name was Darcil of Olivera
One moment, man. Darcil can be a man and a woman
Look at our first lady. She is called
Darcil Vargas
This is man, right?
How will I know?
For me its the same thing that has a pito or vagina
They get buried the same way
Overrides bet
No, wait, just wait
The size, what is the coffin size?
One meter and ninety
An underground and nineties, Darcil of Olivera,
Do women? Neither the circus
Good afternoon Vadiño
Good afternoon, Abenancio
Vadiño
Vadiño, I'm talking about you
I want you to take me to the Palace
The casinos
You said you do not want to go in those places
From bad to talk with me one and lonely
I do not want to carry that does not know your mujerzuelas, right?
Oh, my flower are all vulvitas vulvitas to pass the time
I will always be yours, Flor
Do you swear?
Vadiño. No Vadiño
Sometimes I think it will turn out well
We could be a normal couple
You come home from work at night with a newspaper under your arm bringing a gift, a souvenir for me
After dinner you put on your pyjamas
And we listen to the radio juntitos well as we are now
We will sit on the sidewalk and talk about life, right?
I will play backgammon with the poor Morena
While you stay here ... with your cooking class
You do not want a child, right?
I want children
Do not worry about that Flower
We have time
Besides me gustas while drive time
I do not lack anything Contigo
Vadiño, close the window
Abenancio,Don Abenancio
Hello my son, you are here
How long has it been?
Have you come to confess your sins?
I have no sins to confess
No sins to confess?
Son, how are you?
And how is our dear Dona Flor?
Well, well, so good
I was walking past, Father and decided to enter
You know, with all of these works the church restoration is never finished
The church could loan me money for a business I have in mind.
The money from the Church is holy, son
I know, father, I know
But God has shown me what is possible
Haria won twelve times in a row at the roulette
Father, that is a great miracle
I will fill the whole church with flowers and help to finish the work at the church, Father
God does not approve of gambling, son
You know what is right and wrong, father?
The ball spinning, spinning round risking the last sheet, the heart
What happened Vadiño?
God forgive me, father
Do you not think that angel enjoys the saints?
You mean...
More respect, sir. We are in the house of God
Excuse me, Abenancio
But this angel has a face gigoló ...
Not like an angel
Watch his eyes only
They are eyes of enjoyment
You are a rogue, Vadiño
But ... returning to our business
If I do well, Abenancio
I assure you that I will build a cathedral
-- Well, but it will be the last time
-- Of course, Don Abenancio
You've had enough, brother
You've lost everything but your clothes
Yet
Yet what?
Not lost clothes
Want to bet?
I paid a lot for it, 200 pesos
More for the shirt, 250
You are going to leave here naked, huh?
So?
Look, I'm going with 100, will you bet?
Compadre, I have to pay
Respect the house of God. That man,
My God, he's drunk
If the police were here you would go to jail my love ...
Vadiño, the neighbours
Mr. Vadiño, I have here your promissory note
-- After
-- Is Mine?
I do not owe anybody anything
Then see and pay.
Are you not Valdomiro Dos Santos Guimaraes?
Here is your signature
Don Casemiro, this document has a guarantor
I was worried for a moment
Raimundo Reyes must pay
The man is filled with silver
We have asked him for the money
He is the guarantor
But he says he will not pay
He will not pay?
Mr. Vila, now I have seen everything
People are so cynical, so rapacious
At the cabaret he is arrogant, he says he has more than a thousand cocoa plantations what does this mean
In Paris he lays with three women at once. 
It proves he is a millionaire
So one hopes he will accept the endorsement
For this you called me here
Ultimately, it was you who borrowed the money
Oh, doctor Casemiro, for the love of god
If he had no capacity to pay
Why endorse the commitment?
I assumed he would pay
And now this
It is wrong
I always choose guarantors carefully
Mundiño Reyes, who would know!
That man is a danger to society
He will demoralise the whole banking system
The sacred trust that there must be, does mean?
Vadiño what do you want to do with the clause?
The guarantor refuses to pay,
You know what you must do
This is unbelievable
Let's put this swindler in jail
You have my full support
-- Thank you for notifying me
-- It was nothing
Rest assured I will not come here without a good guarantor, until then
This liquor is rich and paste barbaric
But it eases a hangover
But that is good is good
Take a drink, my love
Why not say directly what you want?
Or do you think I do not know?
My Flower, do you think I love you just for gain?
Just for gain, yes.
Why not say it?
Okay, I won't waste time.
I need something
I must borrow at least
200,000 Royal
I know, you have a very important task this afternoon
Not a Real or a Royal
I need it, flower, it's a case of life and death
I will pay you tomorrow, with interest
Not a Real
Patience, my love.
At least 100,000 Interests
Only this time
Not a Real
Take care, huh?
Do not play with me
I will give you a beating
This did not spend playing, you know?
Only if I Matas
Largo this shit
Largo this shit carajo!
Dejame miserable
Ahi tenes, bitch
Puta
Murderer, miserable
Why did you do that Vadiño
I'll call the police
Hell!
-- Red 19
-- Red 19
Payment red, 20 points
Leave it there
I will double my bet
Vadiño don't do that
What's that friend
200,000 Royal more to red
-- Game
-- Game
No more bets
Red 36
Leave it all there
-- No, no, no more
-- What is this?
We will break the bank today
Break the bank? Red can not win again
He has no heart, no?
-- Cuidamelo
-- Well
-- There is more
-- There is more
Red 32
Friend, I did not bet
Vadiño! You have escaped today
Was not that you could not?
-- Angel
-- No.
Night high heaven risueño
The stillness is almost a dream
On the forest moon falls as a shower of silver of rare splendor
You just sleep, not hearing your singer
Unearthing the moon's flying colours, painful past
This love
Singing
And the woman I love so much does not hear
She is sleeping
Singing and finally
Neither the moon I have pity
Well, when you see that the flame
I'm
In the haze hid
At the top the Moon elusive
It's in the sky as pensativa
The stars are serene
As a flood of butterflies
-- Silly walk in the light of the moon
-- Silly walk in the light of the moon
The Astros were silent
To listen
Your name among endechas, the painful quejidos
In light of the moon
There I introduce Angel
On the guitar, Fauloso Carliños
On the special, Juvenal Charango
And the sublime flute, P. Good Type
An my fellow singer, Mirandon
The illustrious poet and my friend Cloaldo

Cazuza is Jodido whore you parió
Please, I'm looking for

Third quarter
Excuse me

-- You are Ms Denise?
-- Same
My name Florípedes,
Florípedes Guimaraes
Does this name tells you something?
No. Sit please
Madam, you recently had a baby?
Yes, he is a beautiful child
I can not have children, you know?
It is a problem of birth
You've been hit, right?
A little
But it can heal itself.
The husband of a well-known is cured
My case is serious. There is a need for very complicated operation
Is Medical? Doctors talk beautifully and have horrible writing
You have to consult the mother Balbina
The space in your belly will have children every year
Well, what is your problem?
Well ... I heard hisorias.
Stories, you know?
People talk
The name ... What is the name the father of your baby?
Vadiño, why? If you have something to say
Say it straight
Vadiño is my husband, do you understand?
Look, I'm no lady. A woman's life. Puta.
I do not think he is your husband.
He doesn't like white women.
To Valdemar exists only Dionisia
-- Valdemar?
-- Valdemar, my man
My Vadiño is Valdomiro
You almost scared me to death
I apologize
It does not matter. My Vadiño is black,
Strong, truck driver
Excuse me, shame, excuse me
Calm, now everything is over
Then those married to Yar
-- The other Vadino, which is fanatic ...
-- Is the game fanatic
That is my Vadiño, the same
-- Can I see your child?
-- Of course
-- Can I hold him?
-- If you want
Oh, what a beautiful baby
He is wonderful
It gave what they had to give
Music
This family dinner reminds me a great truth of my friend Pedro Arcanjo
There is no better place for " that house a couple
Especially if it is
Castle Bay
That is everything you will need
Flor. He has been gone for four days
Vadiño must learn to respect you
I know Normita. I know
Flower, it's just a lesson.
Stay with me a few days
Vadiño will ask for forgiveness
I am sure of it
But he must treat you better
He will accept this
I don't want to trouble you
Poor Flower. I came as soon as I heard
I'm on your side
How could he mistreat a woman in this way?
I do not like to get into other people's lives
But you should have left him a long time ago
Since you married
I feel the same.
Stay at my house as long as you want
I have room because the children are on vacation
Thanks Dona Jaci.
It's all decided
She will stay at my house. It is only one or two days
Sofia, Sofia
Sofia. If you see him before tomorrow say that ... had to travel to Nazareth Das Fariñas to visit her mother who is ill
Very sick. In this case a mentirita does not do evil to anyone
Vadiño is here!
Vadiño is here!
Vadiño
Get away, children
Wake Vadiño and you will catch a disease
-- Cayate vagabunda
-- Prostitute
Maleducada
Do you think you are her mother?
Let
Flower, if I send precise call
No more bets please, no more
Make your bets gentlemen
The Black 32
Make your bets gentlemen
No more bets please.
Red on 17
Red on 17, red 17
Red on 17, red 17 ...
Who is she?
Nisa Mayer, a famous singer from Rio de Janeiro
Well, who would guess, my friend from The Palace
It is our anniversary
-- What a nice present
-- Ah, how could I forget?
-- A toast, congratulations
-- Thanks
Tomorrow I will send a boy to your home with a regalito
No need to send a boy.
What do you do Mirandon?
I do management ... I manage.
You know Vadiño.
And excuse me, I must look after my guests.
Try this delicious caviar
It is good
Have a happy and Conchita olorcito
Never again your lips, your tongue
Never again your horrible onion breath
Good day, Dona Flor
Hello lady
My dear lady, at this time after everything
I wish you well in your life
I want some Saudades, please
-- Let me ... -- Dona Floripa, accept these flowers as a gift
-- It is heart
-- Thanks
-- Dona Floripa?
-- That is me
If I may
Desarmelo when the tomb he left for Vadiño because he needs about descasar
Oh, what is it that gives me
That worries me inside.
Will I get
That comes to flower skin.
Will I get
And I ascends to the face and makes me blush
And I jump in the eyes and I betrayed
And I squeezed his chest and makes me confess
What is no longer so to conceal and which no longer has the right that someone is denied
And that makes me begging makes me beg
What we do not have measure nor shall nape
What has no cure nor never will
What we do not have prescription
A few days ago someone asked me what to offer a demanding guest
A palate snob, who wants exotic food
In this case I advise you serve turtle stew
Bone and cupro pecato
But if your guest wants something richer
Why then not serve a dish that has suffered?
A young and beautiful widow
I know a widow and
... whose desert canyon crossing ...
... estaudante ARED desire ...
Without exit door
To all my nerves are praying
That all my organs
're acclamation
And a horrible affliction
I implore ago
Anyone who has no shame nor never will
Anyone who does not have a government nor never will
Anyone who has no judgement
-- Denora
-- How is it?
Well
And Flower?
She is dressing.
She will be ready shortly.
Look what's coming
It is good to see you out of your mourning clothes
Thanks, I did not want give them so much work
Like the piquito?
It's nice
But sit
Okay Mary, please sit
You are pale, flower.
How can that be?
Yes you are pale
I do not know. I feel migraine, Normita
It migraine widow, my daughter.
You need a man
At last. Get up.
I want to see
Yes, it is nice
You need to improve that face
It seemed that with a Urubu mourning
Poor, Mrs. Rocilda
Look, come quick
There is Magnolia. Scoundrel, she does not leave the kids in peace aquela vivija Furtado in Station nao da ujuria
I do not know how she does it, it is shameless
That's not my daughter.
She has standards
What standard can have a fret of those, Normiña?
Do you not know? His nickname is culosublime
Doctor Theodore, there is a lady who wants to talk to you
A minute, I will be there shortly
That the pass well
How are you, Mrs. Norma?
I am well. The one who is not is Morera
Problem liver again.
I do not understand
Morera does not smoke, drink nor eat fat
All he does is play the lottery
Is lottery bad for the liver, Dr. Theodore?
I do not think so, Mrs Norma.
I will fix your husbands problem
It is curious
I have a friend, Jose Octavio.
Perhaps you know him
He also plays the lottery
And suffers from liver
I think Morera is a baby
But I do not like the smell.
Hello Flor ...
How are you Dr. Theodore?
Norm!
Norm!
What's that?
What has happened?
Norma, I want you to tell me you nothing to do with this
Dear Mrs. Florípides, in pursuit of my work
The other day I received a visit from your friend and neighbour, Dona Moreira
In the pleasant conversation we then had
Miela told me of the esteem you held me
I was filled with joy and confidence
In this fascinating world of pharmacy, the world sometimes seems harsh
Now a breath of poetry has come into the mix with walls made of these barbiturates and fortifiers
I am only 42 years old
I am a sensible man, assaulted only by a passion for classical music
I confess the words of your good friend Mrs. Norma have made me sleepless.
Thus, my Madam, we have the same ailment
There is no pharmacological remedy for my insomnia
I hope you do not take this letter as too bold because my intentions are honest, and my affection for you is deep
With friendship and respect,
Teodoro Madureira
It's passionate, Flor.
Very romantic.
Now what do I do?
What do you do? Accept and soon we will have marriage
But Norma, I am a recent widow
Recent? It has been months
I see a smouldering desire.
Marry him
To take things slowly would be foolish
You are right, Normita
On the outside I am respectable
Inside I am shameless, I have debased thoughts and dreams
Debased dreams? You are a woman, this is normal
And Theodore is a cautious man, a good man
It is difficult to find someone good enough for you
Finally, do you like him or not?
I can not deny it, he is very sympathetic
Dona Rocilda
It is with pleasure that I address as lady venerable and Santa to ask for the hand of your daughter
If she would like to accept as her future husband to be my companion on the road of life rocky path many obstacles and setbacks
This route will be transformed to a road in paradise for me
I accept your request
I also wish to get married to you
-- Ah, eh, holy ...
-- Congratulations
-- Thanks
-- Congratulations
Thank you, dear
Daughter mine, congratulations
Thank You
Will you accept a liquor araçá, Dr. Theodore?
Yes, thanks
-- Health
-- Thanks
-- Health
-- Thanks
Viva!
-- Health
-- Thanks
-- Health
-- Normita
Thank You
The liquor is magnificent
Made by the nuns of
Convent of Lapa, right?
No doctor Teodoro,
I made it myself
Of course ... I ... because ...
Very rich, yes?
Ah, yes. A magnificent liquor
Barbarous. Let's sit down
You like alcoholic beverages,
Dr. Theodore?
A little. At social events
Only at social events
Ah, social events,
Understandably
You need to find a new home to live, right?
No Mom, we already spoke about that
We will live here. Is that not so, Dr. Theodore?
Here?
If this is a house of morondanga
Doctor Theodore, what is your social status?
Well ...
The house is very good mom.
The rent is cheap
Besides it is near the pharmacy, is not it?
And it is a known point to my cooking classes
What?
Will you continue to work, flower?
I did everything I could to dissuade her, Dona Rocilda
Flower insisted, she wants to continue her classes
Let me make it clear.
I will pay all the expenses.
Money from the classes is for needles, pequeñeses
Dona Rocilda has not yet spoken
I will say nothing
-- Dr. Theodore, more liquor?
-- Yes, thank you
I just wanted to know one thing
What?
Shh, talk low
What do you think of your future son-in-law?
He seems an honest worker.
A man of good principles
But a doctor would be better than a pharmacist
A doctor of truth, not a doctor of broken feet
-- Congratulations
-- Thanks
Thank You
Congratulations, my daughter.
Dr Theodore, congratulations
Now yes, Flor, will be really happy
How beautiful, Teodoro
Do you know how many couples spent their honeymoon in this room
-- Get comfortable, my angels
-- Thanks
I do not need to wish you good night
They sleep at a stretch.
Quiet
My novatitos ...
Ah ... good night
Good night
You see, my dear, the moon
There at the top and the star of the south
Where do I look?
There, dear
How pretty
That big blue star, that shines bright is the planet Venus
Also called star of the morning, evening or dawn
In latin it says Stella Maris the mariner's guide
Is not Venus the goddess of love as well? One without arms
Yes, of course. She is the goddess of love in Greek mythology
And also a famous sculpture created by a genius classic
But you're trembling with cold
You could get a chill
Do not you think it is time, my love?
As you command, my lord
What do you think?
Very beautiful
While you change your clothes
I'm going to the bathroom
Anon
You look handsome
Theodore, my love
My love
Our love will last an infinite time, dear
We will be faithful a lifetime
Never look at another woman
I, too, a lifetime
And now to sleep
You must be tired after all that has happened today
Teodoro will be good
It will work out very well
You play well, Teodoro
Very nice
Wait till the day of the concert
With all instruments together
Children of Orpheus
You will see something special
Excuse ignorance Teodoro,
But why Orpheus?
Because Orpheus was the genius of music in Greece
He played for animals, for stones
You know everything
Sofia, Teodoro
My dear, you are back at last
-- How is Mrs. Rocilda?
-- Improved thank God
It was only an asthma attack
How fortunate
If you had been gone more than a weekend, I confess
I would have been green with jealousy
-- How was your trip?
-- Pretty good, thank God
But the boat was very full and I'm very tired
Then sit down, my dear
Ah, this is Magdalena,
Our new employee
She has good references.
And is very courteous and serious at work
And Sofia?
I had to dismiss her
While you were away, it was desmandó
She would not obey me, lived resongando
Imagine, I told her the house was dirty, she called me miserable
Well ...
She called me Dr. laxative
How rude
-- Poor
-- What poor?
She was too bold!
Unworthy of your goodness, my love
Sometimes, a person wanting to be caring ends up being stupid
You're right Teodoro
I wanted to surprise you
I expected to be ready before your arrival but give me time
Now you're going to complain you can't find something
A place for everything, everything in its place
Besides ... you know where I found your money?
Behind the valve radio
Flor ... that's a gypsy habit, for low people
Just open an account in the bank
You get interest of 3% per month.
It is always the same
And in the bank your money is guaranteed
Free of danger from thieves
I will think about it, Teodoro
What would I do without you?
I am here as pharmacist proud member of this society
Honored with a doctor's diploma up against their interests
Commercial
Besides, even devoting every moment of my life to treatment of funnels, the degree the pipettes the filters and the pots
By studying such diverse substances as phosphates and mercury oxides and iodine
I do not forget that as a man
I have a duty to comply
A diligent citizen who defends his interest and people's health
Remedies made with machines do not fall within my farmácia
I know that some illustrious men here believe the contrary, they are favourable to the industrialization of medicine
This is true of our illustrious president, Dr. Emilio Feig
Internationally renowned for his discovery of the value of medicinal jurubeba
Thanks Dr. Teodoro
To opponents of this carat
I dedicate all my respect
As for opponents unfair seeking to underestimate my capacity in chemistry and pharmacology respond with the formula strictly correct of a substance that can not be pronounced scientifically
Lanata glucose of c equal to ethane more glucose plus three digitoxosas
More degoxigenólida
Your husband is magnificent
It was beautiful
Do you know? I did not understand almost anything but I loved it
You know, I am proud when someone praises you
Even when it is woman
Over time you will begin to understand.
The basic principles of pharmacology are not complicated ...
Ladies and gentlemen
The concert will begin
Please take your places
There will be a feast of truth
Only Teodoro's closest friends and colleagues are invited
I am honoured to be invited.
I will be there with pleasure
Dona Flor, When I think of how your life has turned out I'm less pessimistic
To see a human satisfied and happy with their lives
My heart is at peace with the world and with myself
Should I feel this way?
It is a sin, I know Abenancio
I will confess one thing I have not admitted even to myself
My life is so happy, you know
All people envy me
But even when it is perfect we must improve ourselves, and sometimes, I do not know, I feel pain
It is not my feet or head
I think I am not a good person
I do not know, how to explain to you
Abenancio, I think my nature is bad, I do not know
No Dona Flor
It is that you have never been happy before
A happy life does not take romance
It is true
Well, then we hope you can come on Saturday at 8:00?
I will be there, Dona Flor,
God be with you
Amen
At the happy future of two kindred spirits
Our esteemed and newly elected treasurer
Of the Bahia pharmacy society
And his worthy princess, Ms Florípides
Models of talent and virtue and drinks ...
This marriage is a living example blessed by God and man
And that this first anniversary will be the first of many happy anniversaries
Amen, amen
Right from the start I knew
Dr Theodore and Flor were made for each other
I am, well, as a sort of seer amateur
Is not Flor well?
Of course, Edeonora
But there was before seven years of terror
Coming from music
I believe in miracles but on the evidence and its scientific validity there are slight differences ...
He is now in ... is bursting ...
His money gets him a beautiful woman
No, there is no money. It is his treatment of ... spirit, joy, peace
Who would guess she would find everything with our apothecary friend!
What are speaking of with such enthusiasm?
Nothing, nothing
We were talking of the beauty and  sympathy of our host
Thank you very much
Doctor Theodore ...
Until the mentally retarded is calm hearing sounds melodic
For example, a bassoon played well
Or a violin, incidentally
The experimental evidence is clear
Even a cripple may improve his general condition receiving a dose Masisa good music
Of course, that depends on the physical
Thank You
I think we chatted too long, Dr. Teodoro
No way
No, no. It is time
My dear, it's time to go
It was an unforgettable night
Once again congratulations
Dona Florípides
Thanks, again provided
-- It really was an unforgettable night
-- Thank you
-- My congratulations
-- Thanks
I will accompany you to the door
Good night
I will be back at once
Come here
Why just came today?
You sent for me
I just got your call
It has been long, eh ...
No, not on the mouth,
I can not
Follow your own path
Well am I different?
Have I changed a little?
I think a little fatter
Beautiful
Nice embroidery
Father Abenancio was right
When you look at the ass ...
Stop inventing Vadiño, don
Abenancio never looked at me
He is very respectful
Move your foot Vadiño
Do you forget I am married and serious?
The only person I can touch is my husband
And what am I?
Your husband, have you forgotten?
And the first priority I have
Vadiño, go. He will be back soon
I am happy to see you, but now please go
Oh, no
Vadiño, you must go, he will be arriving at the door
Just think if he sees you here what will I say?
Boba
He will not see me
Nobody sees me
Only you, my flower of perdition
Vadiño, he will sleep in this bed
I can not prevent it, Flor
But push a little bit we three can lie here
More respect, I am an honest lady, do you see?
You called me, Flor
Vadiño, go. We will talk tomorrow
But well-dressed because it is not good to be bare
It is not proper for conversation 
I go, and then come back, Flor?
You think it is the same as a trip from here to Santana?
You think I go back there and then?
Vadiño, go
Vadiño, even knowing he will not see you
I am full of shame
I do not want to face that
Go
Okay, I will walk around and resolve it tomorrow
But first I want a kiss
On the mouth if you want me to leave
Vadiño, he is here, go, go
Vadiño go!
Haste then colleague
Our first feast, my dear
Everything went well
Nothing awry
All perfect, without slips.
As I like it
Fortunately everything went well, did it not Teodoro?
I will get a glass of water
No more bets
Black 17
Forty with two hundred and forty
No more bets
Black 17
It is the marriage of heaven and earth
Black 17, gringa Chota
Black 17
Vadiño, you went to the game.
Go, I want you to go
Come here, come
Lie here beside me, lie here
You will try to seduce me
I promise I will not touch you
You'll give me your tongue spontaneously and voluntarily
You will open your legs and ask me to push
Is that so?
Push what?
Your honey pot
I thought you had improved, but you're more Zafar
Come here, come
Just to talk
Come
I am fine here
Sometimes I want to see and talk to you
You were so bad for me
Do bad I?
What did I do now?
You had affairs with two of my students, Caia and Rosalie
That is not bad, they were distractions to pass the time
Imagine the shame, you died and were buried and I married again
After everything you are still chasing
I was so eager to have you ...
I will never deceive, Vadiño
Teodoro deserves all my love
We were going to talk, you promised not to try anything
I promised I would not force you
Try, I will always try
Okay, what more do you want to talk?
How is the Earth from up there?
The Earth is blue
Blue, how beautiful
And God? Did you meet him?
Is God?
God is the lottery "El Gordo"
Take your hand from there remember your promise
I will make sure the roulette does not come out on 17
You know what happened was impossible
It is a spell, Ediño, evil eye, witchcraft
Get out of here, Zafar
What happened, my love?
Zafadito
Two o'clock in the morning and the ball hasn't landed on 17
I was right, it was witchcraft
Look at Mirandon
Mirandon ...
17, son of a whore
Black 17
Cloakroom next to Flor
Full with the intimate lingerie of the lady
This is crazy, Tara
Shirt of your Teodoro
My love ...
What are you doing?
Where were you?
Important commitment, Flor
Ah, important commitment, it's always the same thing
You said I should go
Why these complaints?
That is Teodoro's
Shirt? Take it off
You said you do not want me naked
No Vadiño no
I have come again
I have come to catch you, no?
To fill your honey pot, burning with fire, huh?
No, Vadiño, you came to talk
Vadiño, you came to talk
For cogre ... to catch
No
Flor
Vadiño, someone is here
Vadiño, there are people, disappear.
Flor, my friend
Dionisia
Dionisia, God sent you, only you can help me
What has happened, my friend?
I need someone to free me from
Vadiño. To send him back
Your dead husband?
He has come to see me
It is very upsetting
I don't know what else to do.
He came because I called him.
My friend, please to something to put him to rest again
I do not know what will happen
All day I think of him
When he was here I felt I wanted him
He gives me so much desire that I almost
If he continues to come I will give in to him
Friend, I will talk to father Geronimo now
Geronimo?
Yes, this is not for Mrs Balbina
Vadiño is protected from her...
This is something for one who uses a cane ...
Do it fast or I will be in disgrace
Wait here. I will get you some money
Do you remember the first time we made love?
Your legs pressed against mine
You embraced me with your arms
Your mermaid tail
Your tummy ...
Your avocado breasts
Your scent, intoxicating
And these, swelling fuller
I was tingling from head to toe
And naked
And best of all
Was your taste
You know what has taste
Pepper
Honey
What did you do Flor?
Are you sending me back?
My God, the spell is cast
Vadiño!
Vadiño you are even more crazy

We’ve almost arrived.
How will I get there?
You’ll find the way.
You don’t need help.
I’ve come a long way.
I booked a room by telegram.
Who can I see?
Everybody is sleeping.
I’ll tell the doctor when he wakes up.
Sleeping?
It’s daytime not night.
They sleep all the time.
You didn’t know?
Night never comes here.
You can wait downstairs.
In the restaurant.
The doctor will see you now.
Where is he?
We received your telegram yesterday.
We sent our coach to the station.
You must have arrived on a different train.
The station?
We don’t have a good train connection here.
How are you feeling?
Is my father alive?
Of course.
I mean to an extent allowed by the situation.
You know, just as I do, that from the perspective of your home, your country, you father is dead.
This cannot be fully reversed.
His death casts a shadow on his existence here.
But he doesn’t know or suspect?
Don’t worry.
Our patients don’t suspect anything.
They can’t.
You probably want to see your father.
I’ll take you there.
We reserved a bed for you in his room, as you requested.
The trick is that we moved back time.
Time is late here by an interval which I can’t precisely define.
It all boils down to relativity.
Here, your father’s death hasn’t occurred yet.
But he met with his death in your country.
So my father is dead.
- Or is close to death.
- You don’t understand.
We reactivate past time with all its possibilities.
Including recovery.
We let our patients sleep for a long time.
We spare their vital energy.
They have nothing better to do anyway.
Why don’t you lie down?
There’s nothing more you can do now.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I came to talk to you.
Go on.
Why are you spreading lies and gossip about father?
- What lies?
- I know you’re behind them.
I didn’t lie.
You remember how he went missing for many days.
He avoided us.
Who knows whether he’s still alive somewhere?
I have to know the truth.
Stop tormenting me.
It’s hard to communicate with him.
How can I cope with everything myself?
How can I answer questions which God keeps asking me?
It’s too much for me.
His complaints terrify me.
- Don’t cry.
- I have a migraine.
You won’t go to school today.
To school?
Mom, I’m not a little boy anymore.
Yes, you are.
You’ve got ink on your hands.
Your knees are bruised.
You’re a naughty, unruly boy.
You hang out with God knows whom.
Wake those good-for-nothings.
It’s time to open the shop.
- But I’m sure...
- Stop tormenting me.
I told you that your father travels around as a salesman.
Sometimes he returns home at night only to go off again before dawn.
I’m sure he’ll come back.
You’re tossing and turning like fish out of water.
- You sleep a bit, doze off a bit...
- Yawn a bit.
And you rest again.
You should learn wisdom from an ant, lazybones.
An ant? Go to hell.
That ant of yours knows no teacher, boss or shegetz.
And it’s doing fine.
What’s he talking about?
I walked the fields of a lazy man.
I walked the vineyards of a stupid man.
Where is that from?
Our Lord didn’t say that.
Don’t listen to it!
Nettles grew over everything.
Thorns covered his land.
And the stonewall collapsed to pieces.
Clap your hands and call out His name while rejoicing.
Call out his name to the sounds of songs and trumpets.
Praise Him with harps, praise Him with lyres.
Praise Him with the drums and dancing.
Praise Him with stringed instruments and horns.
Praise Him with the cymbals.
Praise him with loud clanging cymbals.
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.
Alleluia.
Clap your hands and sing.
Sing.
Sing wisely.
In a dream he saw a ladder that reaches from earth to heaven.
And God’s angels were going up and down on it.
Is it possible?
It’s our little Józef!
Did you get lost on your way to school?
Well?
Rascals! They’re everywhere.
When I want to go down to get bread in the morning,
I can’t even....
...open the door.
They squeeze through cracks.
And try to get into the kitchen.
They ogle me.
They can hardly wag their tails.
They’re overjoyed when they see a fire.
They clap their hands and dance like savages.
They’re hopeless at putting out fire.
But they like to celebrate.
- Who are you talking about?
- Those idle firemen.
They get lazy in autumn.
They sleep while standing.
I think you’re prejudiced.
They’re nice boys.
An old stove-fitter told me that when he repairs chimneys, he finds them attached to the smoke vent, motionless like the larvae.
They sleep like that being drunk from raspberry juice.
And they whine in their sleep:
"Sugar, sugar".
If I glance at one of them, his face swells and becomes obscenely red like a turkey.
I heard that it’s a way of strengthening the inner self.
And rejuvenating colours when firemen eject fireworks, rockets and Bengali lights.
I won’t give them any juice anyway.
I didn’t ruin my complexion hovering over the stove to make it, so those rascals could drink it.
Unfortunately, Adela, you never understood things which go beyond the mundane.
Look.
Is it possible to grow hair to the ground?
You look so different.
Just wonderful!
The captain of rascals!
"I, Anna Csillag, born in Moravia, had poor hair growth".
I wish I had hair like that.
Would you like some water?
- With raspberry juice.
- No, thanks.
Too bad.
Her poor hair growth was divine retribution.
But prayers and penance took the curse off her.
She was graced with enlightenment.
She received signs and made this miraculous remedy.
Look.
These are her brothers, cousins and brothers-in-law.
Who’s he?
Another brother-in-law.
She made a whole town happy.
Really?
"Elsa. The fluid with a swan".
It’s a balm for all afflictions.
It works wonders.
Where did you get this book?
It’s been here all the time, scattered around.
"Smoke all you want".
"Sexual Neurasthenia".
"Gramophones".
You silly thing.
We use its pages to wrap meat and your father’s lunch.
It’s degradation of an original book.
You’re late.
There’s no more juice.
I have some rose preserve.
It’s not bad.
Adela!
- Try it.
- Thank you.
- It’s not a preserve.
- So what? It tastes sweet.
Is your name Jakub?
No, I’m Józef.
Jakub is my father.
I see.
Can you come out?
We can’t talk like this.
- Excuse me.
- It’s all right.
I have a valuable delivery.
Where can I find your father?
I’m looking for him myself.
Allow me to introduce
Honduras and Nicaragua.
Come closer.
It’s spotted.
That’s right.
It’s perishable.
- Birds of paradise?
- Not only.
For hatching, it’s best to let
Belgian hens sit on them.
Or you can do it yourself.
I think I see your father.
Over there!
Don’t you think he’s behaving in a strange way?
He’s demonstrating.
Father!
Father...
You should beware of things like narrow-mindedness, pedantry and blind literalism.
Have you noticed that in some books flocks of swallows are flying between the verses?
Stanzas of swallows.
You should learn to read from the flight of these birds.
Father. I have to tell you something.
It’s a secret.
I found an original.
- An original?
- Yes.
Look.
It’s worthless!
It’s a book!
It’s just a myth.
A book is a myth we believe in when we’re young.
We stop treating it seriously as we get older.
Books live a borrowed life.
Every book has a moment when it soars into the air like a phoenix with its pages on fire!
Look.
We love them for that moment.
But they turn to ashes.
Thank you.
Why doesn’t anybody offer goldfinch?
Where?
A book is a myth, my son.
It soars into the air like a phoenix.

You’re talking nonsense.
You could say Panfibras.
Haleiwa, Abracadabra.
Why do I get the feeling that I’ve been there before?
A long time ago.
What if we know all landscapes that we come across in life?
Can anything new happen?
Something we can’t sense?
Do you hear me?
I want to know if all this could have happened.
Answer me.
Did it happen or not?
Yes and no.
There are some things that can’t fully happen.
They are too grand and magnificent to fit into an event.
They just try to happen.
Tell me if they really exist.
She did exist.
And nothing can take away my certainty.
Don’t be afraid.
She can’t hear us.
It’s my dead mother, she lives here.
She’s inhabited by ghosts, phantoms, larvae and chrysalises.
Helpless and naive, she takes them into her dream and sleeps with them.
She wakes up half-conscious at dawn and remembers nothing.
That’s why she’s so sad.
She has to live so many lives.
Do you know a story that time cannot change?
There is one that you haven’t heard.
It belongs to the night.
Will you find the patience to listen to it?
Somebody will walk across the sky, cuddling a baby in a coat.
Constantly on the way, on a endless journey.
He’ll pass us with long steps.
That’s what’s going to happen.
Over and over again.
Bianca, you can count on me!
Till the last drop of blood!
Well?
It’s a riddle.
What about her?
She’s all grey.
The touch of her hand must be beyond imagination.
What did you see there?
Something colourful, colonial terrifying.
Abductions, pursuits, betrayals.
It’s a story about an abducted and switched princess.
You’re making it up.
Java.
Sumatra.
Borneo.
I can appoint you as coregent.
Anonymously.
Together with the stamp album we’ll form a triumvirate.
We’ll be responsible for this unsolved affair.
With the stamp album?
What a naive question.
It’s a universal book.
A compendium of knowledge about human life containing allusions and understatements.
This story will be interspersed with dashes, ellipses and sighs.
It requires a bit of intelligence and imagination.
Your words are delirious, ridiculous, insane.
I was fond of you, Rudolf, because you own this album.
Now your outbursts of envy put me off.
Don’t forget that you’re dependent on me.
I have to get to the other side.
I know.
Her father is a ship’s doctor.
A small steam boat with wheels at the sides is waiting for her every night at the pier.
It’s lights are off.
Don’t go there.
I have a bad feeling.
Don’t worry. I may seem excited, but I have my fears.
Won’t it be safer to look through the stamp album?
You haven’t seen New Mexico.
Remember that there is no final Mexico.
Behind every Mexico there is a new one.
They only seem dead.
The don’t have to breathe for a longer period.
These villains won’t be characters in novels.
They’re just a makeshift creation, a one-time thing.
They were caught at a moment when their obsession, their madness was real.
Skilfully prepared, it became the core of their new existence.
A new man was created in the image of a mannequin.
This is anarchist Luccheni, assassin of Empress Elisabeth.
And this is Draga, the demonic Queen of Serbia.
Edison and Bismarck.
"Leatherstocking".
This is a young genius, the pride and hope of his family.
Addiction to masturbation ruined his life.
Unfortunately, they’re not authentic.
But we put a lot of effort into making them look good.
Their faces are pale, flushed from the illness they died of.
Now take a look at
Emperor Franz Joseph.
Wrinkles on his face make him look like he’s smiling.
But when you come closer, you see that his smile is just a grimace of bitterness and terseness.
He had a younger brother, so different spiritually and ideologically.
This unfortunate antagonist, disadvantaged by birth, was Archduke Maximilian.
The emperor loved him secretly, but planned to get rid of him.
He appointed him commander of the Levantine Ship Squadron, hoping that he’d go under.
Later he signed a secret alliance with Napoleon III.
That’s him.
He used deception to involve
Maximilian in the Mexican incident.
This creative young man renounced his Habsburg title only to ride aboard the French liner "Le Cid" right into a trap.
Some sources say he was just a cousin.
Others that he was never born.
He was conjectured from the fears and hallucinations the emperor experienced while sleeping.
We had problems putting him back together after his execution in Vera Cruz.
Unfortunately, he still suffers from amnesia.
I had to teach him everything about his life again.
My only success is that at the sound of the name of Emperor Franz Joseph he draws his sword.
He wounded Victor Emmanuel.
The latter didn’t manage to get out of his way quickly enough.
Bianca... and Maximilian?
It’s a simple mechanical trick.
When wound up he moves and acts like a live person.
A simple mechanical trick, my foot!
A cynic in the tropics.
No, a tropical cynic.
And Rudolf said I exaggerated and made things up.
They should take their medicine and be in bed by now.
It’s not good to keep them on stands for so long.
I can smell curare.
Would you like to see my collection of weapons?
So my intuition was right after all.
Under the cover of law and order hair-rising things are happening here.
Will you tell me who Bianca is?
Her mother was a Creole.
Archduke Maximilian called her lovingly Conchita.
She went down in history under that name, through the back door.
Her mother?
You mean grandmother?
Mother.
After Maximilian’s downfall, she took her daughter to Paris.
She lived on a widow’s pension.
That’s where history loses track of our touching character.
Allow me to finish for you.
It’s confidential!
Keep calm and control yourself.
100,000 pesos.
My business is not going well.
It’s an expensive project.
In 1900 a Mrs. de V, a woman of exotic beauty, leaves France and goes to Austria with her daughter and husband, having fake passports.
They get arrested in Salzburg, while changing trains to Vienna.
After checking his fake passport,
Mr. de V is free to go.
But he does nothing to get his wife and daughter released.
That very day he goes back to France and is never seen again.
I will be the one to identify him.
150,000 pesos.
You’re so uncompromising.
What do you want?
Your decisions will show if you’re aware of the situation.
- I want facts!
- Stop!
I think Bianca’s origin has been confirmed.
Negroes!
Hordes of Negroes!
Negroes at this time of the year?
The barometer must be at its lowest point.
Bianca?
I thought you’d never get here.
- Sit down.
- No, infanta.
I have to do duties which fate has assigned to me.
I have to carry out my plan.
Did you bring anything to read?
Decrees. Sign them.
"Daisy, Daisy give me your answer".
Barrel organs everywhere!
Real marvels of technology.
They may come in handy.
Things went so far that
I got involved in the dynastic affairs of great monarchs.
I think we’re in trouble.
Let’s think about betrayal.
- Betrayal?
- Yes.
- Betrayal?
- That’s right.
Do you have a better idea?
I don’t understand.
It must be a wonderful feeling.
To penetrate the depths of villainy and erase oneself from one’s own memory.
Wouldn’t you like to be defiled or repulsive for a moment?
But totally renewed.
Do it.
You’ll become one of them.
One of those black Negroes.
Now that things are at the final stage you want me to betray?
You’re ridiculous with your faithfulness and sense of mission!
- What if I chose Rudolf?
- No.
I prefer him a thousand times over you, a boring pedant.
He would be obedient.
Even when it came to crime or self-destruction.
Rudolf obedient?
Do you remember Lonka, the washerwoman’s daughter?
You played with her when you were a little boy.
- Yes.
- It was me.
Only I was a boy at that time.
Did you like me then?
Bianca, I feel everything is going the wrong way.
Must you disappoint me?
May I see your tickets, please?
Conductor...
What is going on here?
Take it easy. Don’t panic.
We’ll fix everything quietly.
We don’t need help.
Normal facts are arranged in time.
They are threaded on it...
...like onto a string.
It’s important for narration and continuity.
Fine.
What about events which have no place in time?
Events which have occurred too late, when time has been allocated?
Is time too tight to take in all events?
Time has its side offshoots, somewhat illegal and dubious.
But we can’t be too fussy when dealing with events that cannot be classified.
Who knows? Maybe all the dirty manipulation is behind us.
We’re heading to a dead end.
Exactly.
How can I get out of here?
Why don’t you try going under the bed again?
- Excuse me, I have to go.
- Coward!
I hope to come back again.
Coward!
Stupid coward.
It’s you.
You don’t look well.
Everything is mixed up, father.
Father?
It takes a lot of patience to find the right words in this confusion.
You can do it by grammatical analysis of sentences and tenses.
What? I don’t remember.
I am, he is, she is...
I’ve got it!
You are, we are!
They are...
You need to eliminate flirtatious chatter of birds, their pointed adverbs, prepositions, and timid personal pronouns to find a healthy grain of time.
Legend books, unwritten books, great epics, pallid and monotonous nameless novels, faceless giants, dark evening stories, cloudy dramas, errant and lost books.
You must have a lot of work.
The light on in your room late at night.
Try. See if you can do it.
Fascinating!
What a beauty!
Remember. Paradisea apoda or the bird of paradise.
Cardinalis cardinalis!
Chrysolophus pictus.
Upupa epops.
I want you to take something with you.
Anything, at least a tiny bit.
Get it into your blood, your life and save it.
And live with it.
Come in!
Go now.
They’re looking for you.
I don’t want to be disturbed.
Go.
Go!
Go!
Look at you.
You’re covered in cobwebs.
You ripped your coat.
You’ve been in the attic again.
Shop assistants steal from us, people buy on credit only, and you just play around.
Take it to the shop.
Your father must be hungry.
The shop!
They’re looking for you.
It’s hot.
Who?
The shop assistants, especially Teodor.
I know. They’ll be climbing the ladder up and down.
Up and down.
Józef!
I wish you had been born earlier.
Come!
Take it to them.
It’ll scare them.
Adela, Holofernes was a man.
Whatever. I kept her in borsch to make her look better.
I’ll buy it.
Lay off. It’s not for sale.
What? The head is in a shop, so it’s for sale.
I’ll buy it.
Father!
Take it away.
There’s no room here.
Stop bothering me.
I’m busy.
Jakub! Go on, trade!
Father!
Wake up, Józef.
I know you’re exhausted.
It’s only a few steps more.
Father, you’re ill. You should take care of yourself.
Can you hear him?
He’s coming.
I know him since childhood.
We went to school together.
That egoist disgusted me.
He devoured lots of buttered rolls.
Go and meet him.
He’ll think I ignore him.
Go!
If I’m not mistaken it’s Józef,
Jakub’s son.
May the sky over your heads always be blue, and the ground under your feet moist with dew.
I don’t think I need to say that.
You can hear their shop is as busy as a beehive.
It’s just appearances and pitiful mystification.
Mother complains that people buy on credit only.
- What did he say?
- Credit.
- I must have misheard.
- I could have expected it.
- They sell on credit.
- Enough! I don’t want to hear it.
Why do you keep bowing?
Turn your ear and listen to the words of the wise.
Apply your heart to my teaching.
I sold for cash.
Help our fellow man as much as we can, but be vigilant we don’t fall ourselves.
The seven years of plenty will come to this land.
It was Christian Seipel and Sons, owners of weaving mills.
The rich man laboured in gathering riches, and when he rests he shall be filled with his goods.
The poor man laboured in his low way of life, and in the end he is still poor.
Come.
She doesn’t show up in the park anymore.
They must be guarding her.
They smelled danger.
It’s nothing but humbug!
Extraterritoriality! Mexico!
Maximilian! Cotton plantations!
Enough!
Who told you that?
The files of this secret conspiracy were never revealed.
I’m the owner of this stamp album.
I won’t lend it to you again for such purposes.
I must admit that the whole thing is incredible.
Unbelievable.
What do you think, Rudolf?
Who could have conceived such an evil idea, which goes beyond any fantasy?
I’m amazed myself.
Tittle-tattle!
Our partnership is over!
Suit yourself.
I said I would prove that it was all true.
- Where is Mr. de V?
- He’s left.
We’ll see.
Where is the infanta?
Her Highness has left too.
Nobody is here.
Right. Get out.
Somebody must have betrayed me.
Abra...
Abra?
Abracadabra.
Great.
Come on. Get up!
Haleiwa!
Vienna!
Bravo!
Mount your horses, gentlemen!
Haleiwa!
- What’s going on here?
- This way, Your Highness.
Forward!
Gentlemen,
I troubled you in vain.
These people are free to go.
Don’t harm them.
In my blindness I wanted to preach the scripture, to interpret God’s will.
My false belief made me pursue obscure clues and make random conclusions.
Allow me, my friend.
Noble gentlemen and you, infanta.
I hand the regency to Rudolf.
I abdicate!
You’re free, noble gentlemen.
Thank you in the name of our idea.
Our dethroned idea, which...
Hurry!
Hurry!
Father!
Call Garibaldi.
He’s an expert on wounds.
Bianca.
Get a stretcher.
Hurry!
What a fatal night.
I didn’t foresee it.
He had a noble heart after all.
I have wronged him.
Rudolf, you must comfort Bianca, love her with double love to replace her father.
You want to take him with you?
Let’s form a procession.
Form a procession!
One more thing, Rudolf.
I should be the one to provide for the old age of those homeless heroes.
Unfortunately I’m a pauper.
- How much?
- Ten thousand.
- Five.
- No.
Twelve.
Gentlemen! After what happened no wax museum will take you in.
Competition is big.
As you have no practical skills, my friend made a donation to purchase twelve barrel organs.
Go around the world and play to make people happy.
You can choose the music.
Now, dear friends and noble gentlemen, let’s cheer together:
Long live the newlyweds!
Farewell, gentlemen.
May what you see be a warning to you.
Don’t ever try to guess
God’s intentions.
Ignorabimus, gentlemen.
Ignorabimus.
Are you Józef, Jakub’s son?
Maybe. Yes.
Did you dream the standard dream of biblical Joseph?
Maybe.
Well?
Do you know that your dream was noticed at the highest level and was severely criticized?
I’m not responsible for my dreams.
Yes, you are.
You are under arrest in the name of His Imperial and Royal Majesty.
I’m at your disposal.
His Imperial and Royal Majesty’s bureaucracy is a bit slow.
I have surpassed that early dream with more serious deeds.
I wanted to do justice and kill myself.
Now that obsolete dream has saved my life!
- Don’t cry.
- I have a migraine.
Come. We’ll make tea.
Is Adela at home?
Adela left to America.
She left?
She went by ship and it sank.
All passengers died.
We never heard from her again.
What about father?
Where is he?
He left many times, but it was never final.
It had its good points.
This way he prepared us for his ultimate departure.
Take me to him.
All right.
I think it’s time for you to see him.
The shop is closed for good.
Sometimes I go down there to sell the remnants.
But the shutters are only half-open.
He was one of those whose face was touched by the hand of God while sleeping.
They know what they don’t know.
They become speculative and suspicious.
Through closed eyelids they see images of distant worlds.
For man goes to his eternal home, while mourners go about in the street.
Before the silver cord is broken, and the golden bowl is crushed.
The pitcher by the well is broken, and the wheel at the cistern is crushed.
Then the dust will return to the earth as it was.
And the spirit will return to God who gave it.
I’m so glad to see you, Józef.
What a surprise.
I feel so lonely here.
Although I can’t complain.
I’ve been through worse things.
I must tell you something.
But don’t laugh.
I rented a place for a shop here.
It’s nothing much.
Back home I’d be ashamed to have a stall like that.
But here we had to pull in our horns.
Isn’t that right, Józef?
Life goes on.
I must have overwound it.
I see you’re sleepy.
Go back to sleep.
You have no idea how hard it was to get a loan.
People here don’t trust old merchants.
Merchants with past experience.
Do you remember the optician’s shop in the market square?
Our shop is right next door.
We don’t have a sign yet.
But you’ll find it.
You’re going out without your coat?
I couldn’t find it in my trunk.
They forgot to pack it.
Take my coat.
No. See you.
Jakub! Go on, trade.
Why don’t you sit down, father?
You’re ill. You should take care of yourself.
Stop bothering me.
I’m busy.
A letter came for you.
It’s on my desk among papers.
On my first day here
I was served an excellent fillet of beef with mushrooms.
It was a hell of a piece of meat.
I have to warn you.
If they ever want to serve you fillet of beef...
Fillet of beef...
I still feel fire in my stomach.
I have diarrhea after diarrhea.
It’s really tough.
Or take, for instance, hunter-style roast, stuffed with pate with gravy.
Here we don’t have to deny ourselves anything.
We can afford to indulge big style.
An angel of a boy.
So precious.
You must admit he’s charming.
Got a light?
Even schoolgirls here wear bows in a special manner.
If you as much as glance at them, you get that sultry look... which fills us with desire.
I have to see the doctor.
He’s at the restaurant.
I’ve just been there.
Sorry.
I meant the operating room.
We’re evidently in a trap.
Ever since I came here, the sanatorium personnel hasn’t done anything to provide proper care.
We’re left to ourselves.
I can’t get a bed, not to mention clean linen.
Those secrets and discreet looks of yours are just a mystification.
I feel like opening all those doors to expose the intrigue we got involved in.
Get some sleep.
You can hardly keep on your feet.
Józef, Józef...
I’ve been lying in bed here, left without any care.
The wires have been cut.
Nobody comes to see me.
Nobody can make me a cup of tea.
My own son has abandoned his sick father to chase girls in town.
Józef, you should go to our shop more often.
The shop assistants are stealing from us.
Our shop will go to waste if nobody takes care of it.
Look, my heart is pounding.
My strength is leaving me.
Józef, was there any mail from home?
Doctor...
You’re not looking well.
Take your jacket off.
I’ll examine you.
Your irritation is justified.
Your body, especially your nervous system has to adjust to new conditions.
We were deceived by an ad.
It wasn’t a good idea to send my father here.
Moving back time!
It sounds good.
But what is it in fact?
Do we get fully valuable and credible time here?
No. We get time used up by people.
It’s frayed and full of holes.
It’s vomited, secondhand time!
You may question the quality of your father’s existence, but you can see him and talk to him.
You should be very grateful to the doctor.
Enough! Space is for people.
In space you can swing around, turn somersaults, jump from one star to another.
But don’t tamper with time!
The blame for this lies in fast decomposition...
Of time.
We all know that this chaotic element can be kept within certain bounds if regulated continually.
If not, it begins to play all kinds of tricks.
Isn’t that right?
You should take better care of yourself.
Wear warmer clothes.
To start with, get some exercise.
Later we’ll see.
Chin up!
It’s lucky that father is no longer alive.
It won’t affect him anymore.

WHY DID YOU TELL ME
TO COME THIS WAY, GRIZELDA?
YOU KNOW I HATE NATURE.
LOOK AT THOSE DISGUSTING TREES
STEALING MY OXYGEN.
OH, I CAN'T STAND THIS SCENERY
ANOTHER MINUTE.
ALL NATURAL FORESTS
SHOULD BE TURNED INTO
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.
I WANT CEMENT
COVERING EVERY BLADE
OF GRASS IN THIS NATION.
DON'T WE TAXPAYERS
HAVE A VOICE ANYMORE?
DO YOU EVER SHUT UP?
THE POLICE ARE OUT
LOOKING FOR US, YOU KNOW.
WE'RE GOING TO CAMP OUT
HERE OVERNIGHT.
CAMP OUT?
OH, NOT ME.
OH, NOT ME.
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,
MISS PEGGY GRAVEL.
YOU BETTER
CALM YOURSELF DOWN
BEFORE I HAUL OFF
AND SMACK YOU
UPSIDE
YOUR WIDE, WIDE HEAD.
WE KILLED YOUR HUSBAND,
AND I AIN'T YOUR MAID

I'M YOUR
SISTER IN CRIME.
PLEASE, DON'T SIT ON ME.
OHH!
OHH!
UH-OH. HERE COME
THE HONKERS ALREADY.
UH-OH. HERE COME
THE HONKERS ALREADY.
OK, WITCHES,
UP AGAINST THE CAR--
ARMS UP ON THE CAR.
ONE FALSE MOVE,
AND YOUR HEAD WILL BE FLYING
THROUGH THEM TREES.
WHAT IS THIS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
DOES IT LOOKING LIKE
I'M KIDDING, MAU MAU?
OFFICER...
I AM AN OUTPATIENT
FROM THE HOSPITAL,
AND I'M VERY PRONE
TO ANXIETY ATTACKS,
SO PLEASE TREAT ME
WITH THERAPEUTIC COURTESY.
HA! I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
THERE'S AN ALL-POINTS
BULLETIN OUT
FOR BOTH OF YOU.
YOU'RE PEGGY GRAVEL,
AND YOU KILLED YOUR HUSBAND.
WHY, THAT'S
PREPOSTEROUS.
WE WERE ABOUT
TO HAVE A PICNIC.
DON'T GIVE ME
THAT SHIT.
YOU WERE TRYING
TO ESCAPE TO MORTVILLE.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF NO
TOWN CALLED MORTVILLE.
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE.
YOU BELONG THERE.
IT'S A SPECIAL TOWN
FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU TWO--
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE
SO EMBARRASSED
BY WHAT THEY'VE DONE.
I JUST MIGHT LET YOU
GO THERE--
THAT IS, IF YOU COOPERATE.
WHAT DO WE HAVE
TO DO FOR YOU,
SHERIFF SHIT FACE?
SIT ON THAT CAR HOOD.
YOU'LL SEE.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU FIRST.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
YOU LIKE LINGERIE?
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THESE LITTLE NUMBERS?
I SENT AWAY TO 'EM
FROM FREDERICK'S.
THEY WAS EXPENSIVE.
I LOVE THE FEEL OF
COLD NYLON ON MY BIG BUTT.
WILL YOU PLEASE STOP IT?
I HAVE NEVER FOUND
THE ANTICS OF DEVIANTS
TO BE ONE BIT AMUSING.
WHAT I LIKE BEST
IS A FRENCH KISS
WHEN I'M ALL DRESSED.
DON'T EXPECT NO KISS
FROM ME, LIVER LIPS.
COME ON.
TAKE OFF YOUR UNDERPANTS.
HAND 'EM OVER.
I KNEW COPS WAS SICK,

GODDAMN GUM.

AREALSOUL KISS.
OK, BUSTER,
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.
NOW, WHICH WAY
TO MORTVILLE?
I AIN'T THROUGH YET.
MRS. GRAVEL,
I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE
YOURUNDERPANTS.
I WILL NOT!
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO GO TO MORTVILLE.
THEY LET KILLERS
LIVE THERE SCOT-FREE.
THEY LET KILLERS
LIVE THERE SCOT-FREE.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN

IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
[BREATHING

YOU'VE GOT GOOD TASTE.
I THINK I'LL TRY TO FIT
MY BIG BUSINESS INTO THEM.
HA HA HA HA!
OOH! OOH.
THEY'RE TIGHT,
BUT THEY SURE FEEL GOOD.
NOW DO I GET
MY LITTLE KISS KISS?
NO! PLEASE, NOT A KISS!
I SWEAR I'LL GAG!
MOUTH ME IF YOU MUST,
BUT NOT A KISS!
COME ON, NOW.
I'M ALL DRESSED UP
IN MY PRETTY UNDERTHINGS,
AND I NEED A LITTLE
LIP SUCTION.
I--

AND NOW FOR THAT MOUTH.
NO.
[GROANS]
NO.
I'D LIKE TO STICK
MY WHOLE HEAD
IN YOUR MOUTH
AND LET YOU SUCK OUT
MY EYEBALLS.
I BET YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?
OHH! AHH!
AHH! AHH!
AHH! AHH!
AHH! AHH!
AHH! AHH!
WHAT ARE YOU HOGS
LOOKING AT?

MERINGUE OR CHOCOLATE?
CHOCOLATE, HONEY.
OK.
Man: SHUT UP, MAN.
THAT'LL BE
10 CENTS.
COULD YOU RECOMMEND
A ROOMING HOUSE
WHERE WE COULD
SPEND THE NIGHT?
[LAUGHS]
[LAUGHS]
I DON'T THINK
I LIKE IT HERE.
IT'S FILTHY, AND
THE PEOPLE ARE REPULSIVE.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE,
PEGGY,
AND IT'S BETTER
THAN JAIL.
I'LL TELL YOU,
GRIZELDA,
THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG HERE.
LOOK AROUND YOU.
IT'S A VILLAGE
OF IDIOTS.
Woman: SOMEBODY HELP ME.
Woman: SOMEBODY HELP ME.
CAN'T YOU ACT NORMAL?
JUST ACT NORMAL
FOR A CHANGE.
JUST ACT NORMAL

Peggy:

COURT OR SOMETHING.
I CAN'T GO
IN THAT HOG PEN.
OH, SHUT UP.
OH, SHUT UP.
[BLOWS]
EW.
[BLOWS]

CAN I HELP YOU?
WE WERE RAPED.
PLEASE, GIVE US SHELTER.
YOU WERE RAPED?
LOOK, DON'T PAY
NO ATTENTION TO HER.
WE NEED TO RENT A ROOM.
YOU GOT MONEY ON YOU?
I'M A VERY WEALTHY
WOMAN.
YEAH, AND
I'M CYBILL SHEPHERD.
COME ON IN HERE. WE MIGHT
WORK SOMETHING OUT--
THAT IS,
IF YOU GOT MONEY.
THAT IS,
IF YOU GOT MONEY.
MY NAME'S MOLE--
MOLE McHENRY.
I'M PEGGY GRAVEL.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
[SPITS]     I'M GRIZELDA--
GRIZELDA BROWN.
I'M PEGGY'S
PSYCHIATRIC NURSE.

THAT DUMB FUCK
LEFT A MESS EVERYWHERE.
THAT DUMB FUCK
LEFT A MESS EVERYWHERE.
Peggy: OH!
Peggy: OH!
AW, DAMN,
IT STINKS IN HERE.
[PEGGY COUGHS]
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT?
WILL HE BE REMOVED?
YEAH, I'LL GET THE STIFF
OUT OF HERE,
BUT DON'T THINK
I GOT TIME
FOR ALL THE CHORES
IN THE WORLD.
AND NO LINENS UNTIL
I SOAK THESE IN COLD WATER.
AND WE AIN'T GOT
NO TOILETS IN MORTVILLE.
HOW DO WE...
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
I SEE, I SEE.
HOW MUCH CASH YOU GOT?
GIVE ME THAT!
6 BUCKS. HEY,
YOU ARE A RICH ONE.
A LOTTERY TICKET.
WELL, I'LL TAKE THAT,
AND I'LL WIN IT.
WHAT'S THIS?
A BANK BOOK?
A LOT OF GOOD
THAT'LL DO YOU HERE.
THERE--THERE AREN'T
ANY BANKS IN MORTVILLE?
THERE AIN'T NOTHING
HERE, LADY.
NOBODY'S GOT
ONE RED CENT IN MORTVILLE,
EXCEPT FOR THAT QUEEN.
THE QUEEN?
CAN SHE HELP US?
YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT LIVING IN MORTVILLE.
I THINK WE'D LIKE
TO TAKE THE ROOM.
IT'S ALL YOURS,
SWEETHEART.
YOU HUNGRY?
YEAH.
I THINK I'M GOING
TO EAT MYSELF SOME CHOW,
AND I GOT
A LITTLE EXTRA.
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
A BIG APPETITE.
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP
WITH THE PREPARATION.
WELL, THIS ONE
TAKES THE CAKE.
WELL, THIS ONE
TAKES THE CAKE.
[SPITS]
YOU BOTH SURE ARE
UGLY BITCHES.
GO ON, SIT DOWN.
HEY, MUFFY,
WE GOT COMPANY.
WE REALLY HADN'T PLANNED
ON COMING HERE.
WE'RE FROM
THE GUILFORD NEIGHBORHOOD
IN BALTIMORE.
I BEEN TO BALTIMORE
A FEW TIMES.
SOME BURG.
I HATE IT.
ALL THEM HILLBILLY FUCKS
LOOKING AT YOU.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH,
WE HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO COME TO MORTVILLE.
WE'RE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE.
YOU SEE,
I'M QUITE PROMINENT,
AND WE ACCIDENTALLY
KILLED MY HUSBAND.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DID.
NOBODY'S IN MORTVILLE
FOR A VACATION.
WE ALL DID SOMETHING,
OR WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
DINNER'S SERVED.
OHH. I'M REALLY
NOT THAT HUNGRY.
I INVITED YOU TO DINNER,
AND YOU ACCEPTED.
NOW YOU'LL EAT THIS
IF I HAVE TO JAM IT DOWN
YOUR THROAT.
MUFFY,
I CALLED YOU TO DINNER.
DO I HAVE TO COME IN THERE
AND SMACK YOU?
[YAWNS]
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHOUT THE HOUSE DOWN.
I HEARD YOU
ALL RIGHT ALREADY.
THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND
MUFFY ST. JACQUES--
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN ALL OF MORTVILLE.
HI.
HI.
THIS IS GRIZELDA
AND, UH...

PEGGY--
PEGGY GRAVEL.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
WE RENT THE ROOM
OUT BACK,
SO I GUESS
WE'LL BE NEIGHBORS.
OH, REALLY?
WELL, I SLEEP IN THE ROOM
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU--NAKED.
YOU'RE 5 MINUTES LATE
FOR DINNER, MUFFY.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
OUR LITTLE TALK
ABOUT YOUR LAZINESS?
ABOUT YOUR LAZINESS?
I WAS HAVING
AN EROTIC DREAM.
I WARNED YOU ABOUT
THINKING ABOUT MEN
BEFORE
YOUR AFTERNOON NAP.
DIRTY THOUGHTS
ABOUT DIRTY MEN
BRING ON DIRTY DREAMS,
AND YOU'RE
A DIRTY GIRL, MUFFY.
MOLE, I CAN'T HELP
WHAT I THINK ABOUT.
AFTER ALL,
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
MR. SANDMAN IS NOT
A BULLDOZER LIKE YOU.
I'M WARNING YOU,
MUFFY.
MOLE, SOMETIMES
I NEED A MAN.
I'M A MAN, MUFFY--
A MAN TRAPPED
IN A WOMAN'S BODY.
YEAH, MOLE,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
THE SAME BIG DEAL.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
THE SAME BIG DEAL.
AAH! AAH!
AAH!
UHH! UHH!
TAKE IT BACK!
OH, TAKE IT OUT!

TAKE BACK
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME!
OK, MOLE,
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.
I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE MY MAN.
I'M ONLY QUEER FOR--OHH!
THAT'S BETTER.
YOU SEE, MUFFY KNOWS
HOW I FEEL ABOUT MEN.
I'M NOT ONE TO BE
PUSHED OVER MY LIMIT.
THAT HURT!
Officer: GO!
COME ON!
COME ON!
THERE THEY ARE.
DON'T MOVE, SCAG.
YOU'RE BOTH UNDER ARREST
BY THE ORDER OF HER
MAJESTY QUEEN CARLOTTA.
ANYTHING YOU SAY
COULD PUT YOU IN FRONT

HER MAJESTY, THE HONORABLE
QUEEN CARLOTTA OF MORTVILLE.
WELCOME TO MORTVILLE,
LADIES.
I READ
IN THE BIG CITY PAPERS
THAT YOU ARE WANTED
FOR MURDER!
THE MURDER OF A CERTAIN
MR. BOSLEY GRAVEL.
WE ONLY--
YOU ARE INTERRUPTING
MY FLOW OF POWER!
GIVE THESE PEASANTS A LITTLE
DINNER, LIEUTENANT WILSON.

[COUGHING]
[SPITTING]
NOW LISTEN TO ME, RIFFRAFF.
EVERY WORD I EVER UTTER
IS TO BE TAKEN AS A DIRECT
ROYAL PROCLAMATION,
OR FACE DEATH
BY THE FIRING SQUAD.
YES, MA'AM.
MA'AM?! I'M
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
AND I DEMAND THAT YOU
ADDRESS ME AS SUCH!
YES, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
LET'S SHOW THEM
WE'RE NOT KIDDING.
BRING IN THE PRISONER,
LIEUTENANT WILSON.
COME ON, YOU ROTTEN
SON OF A BITCH.
YOU BASTARD.
YOU BASTARD.
ANY LAST WORDS, GOON FACE?
YOU CAN LICK MY ROYAL
HEMORRHOIDS, YOU FAT PIG.
OH! READY, AIM, FIRE!
OH! READY, AIM, FIRE!
AAH!
I ADVISE YOU TO LISTEN
CAREFULLY, RUBBISH.
ROYAL PROCLAMATION
NUMBER ONE.
[TRUMPETS]
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE
IN MORTVILLE,
YOU MUST ALWAYS
CONSIDER ME YOUR GOD,
AND IF YOU EVER
SEE ME ON THE STREETS,
FALL TO YOUR KNEES AND SHOUT,
"I HONOR YOU, QUEEN CARLOTTA!"
ROYAL PROCLAMATION NUMBER 2.
[TRUMPETS]
YOU MUST LIVE HERE
IN CONSTANT MORTIFICATION,
SOLELY EXISTING TO BRING ME
AND MY TOURISTS
MOMENTS OF ROYAL AMUSEMENT.
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR INCOME,
YOUR LIVING CONDITIONS,
OR YOUR PERSONAL HAPPINESS.
HAVE I MADE MYSELF
PERFECTLY CLEAR?
YES, YOUR ROYAL MAJESTY.
AND YOU, MRS. GRAVEL,
MURDERESS?
YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF
QUITE CLEAR.
YOUR...
YOUR ROYAL MAJESTY.
SO BE IT!
LIEUTENANT WILLIAMS,
TAKE THEM TO OUR UGLY EXPERT,
AND GIVE THEM
A COMPLETE OVERHAUL,
AND WHEN YOU WALK DOWN
THE STREETS OF MORTVILLE,
MAKE SURE YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE WHAT YOU REALLY ARE--
TRASH!
REMOVE THEM!
Lieutenant: COME ON!
WE'RE NOT THROUGH HERE!
Second lieutenant:
COME ON! GET ON YOUR FEET!
COME ON! OUT!
[ALL YELLING]
OUT, OUT, OUT!
OUT, OUT, OUT!
AH. ARE MY DUTIES
OF DISCIPLINE
EVER OVER,
LIEUTENANT WILSON?
REMOVE ME
FROM THIS CONTRAPTION.
I HONOR YOU,
QUEEN CARLOTTA.
YES, I KNOW, I KNOW.
GET ME INTO MY ROYAL COT
AND BE QUICK.
GET ME INTO MY ROYAL COT
AND BE QUICK.
COME ON, COME ON.
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.
COME ON. HURRY, HURRY.
COME ON. YES. COME ON.
IF IT PLEASES THE QUEEN,
ROYAL SECURITY HAS REPORTED
THAT THE PRINCESS COO-COO
HAS RETURNED TO THE CASTLE.
SHE'S BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT AGAIN
WITH THAT GARBAGE MAN.
THAT CHILD OF MINE'LL
BE THE DEATH OF ME YET.
TAKE ME TO HER CHAMBERS.
I HONOR YOU,
YOUR MAJESTY.
BE QUICK. COME ON.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
[HONKING HORN] GET OUT
OF THE WAY, OUT OF THE WAY!
COME ON!
COME ON! HURRY, HURRY!
COME ON, COME ON!
OUT OF THE WAY!

[CUCKOO CLOCK]
[CUCKOO CLOCK]
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I NEED
YOU, LIEUTENANT WILSON.
I HONOR YOU,
YOUR MAJESTY.
COO-COO, I MUST HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU.
OH, LEAVE ME ALONE, MUMMY.
I'VE HAD A WONDERFUL EVENING,
AND I DON'T WANT IT SPOILED
WITH YOUR NOSY NAGGING.
A WONDERFUL EVENING
WITH A GARBAGE MAN?
HE'S NOT
A GARBAGE MAN.
HE JUST HELPS PICK UP TRASH
AT THE NUDIST COLONY.
I HARDLY THINK
THAT A NUDIST JANITOR
IS A PROPER ESCORT
FOR A ROYAL PRINCESS.
I'M 38 YEARS OLD,
AND I CAN DATE WHO I PLEASE.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO ORDER ME AROUND
LIKE ONE
OF YOUR SUBJECTS.
YOU MAY NOT REALIZE IT,
COO-COO,
BUT YOU HAVE
AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
ONE DAY, ALL MORTVILLE
WILL BE YOURS,
AND YOU MUST LEARN
TO RULE WITH DIGNITY.
I DON'T WANT TO BE
QUEEN OF ANYWHERE!
MOTHER, I WANT
TO MARRY HERBERT!
HERBERT? IS THAT HIS NAME?
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
YOU WOULD STEP DOWN
FROM YOUR THRONE
FOR THE LOVE
OF A MUTANT?
BUT, MUMMY,
I LOVE HIM!
WELL, I WON'T HAVE IT!
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO PUNISH YOU, COO-COO.
YOU'RE FORBIDDEN
TO LEAVE YOUR ROOM
UNTIL YOUR
40th BIRTHDAY!
I WON'T STAY
IN THIS CASTLE!
I LOVE HERBERT,
AND I'M GONNA MARRY HIM,
AND YOU WON'T STOP ME!
[SNIFFLING]
[SOBBING] NOW YOU'VE
GIVEN ME ANOTHER NOSEBLEED!
I HATE THIS STUPID TOWN!
GET OUT OF HERE!
LEAVE ME BE!
Wilson: EXCUSE ME,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
TAKE ME TO MY BEDROOM
AND LOCK COO-COO UP
FOR THE NIGHT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
COME ON. HURRY UP,
HURRY UP.
THAT DAUGHTER OF MINE
IS A DELINQUENT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE
DRASTIC STEPS WITH HER.
I HONOR YOU,
QUEEN CARLOTTA.
CAN YOU MAKE IT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
I SUPPOSE SO. UGH.
I BELIEVE
IT'S YOUR NIGHT
TO SERVICE ME,
LIEUTENANT WILSON.
I'M ALWAYS EAGER,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
OH, THAT LOVE MUSCLE.
WHIP IT OUT
AND SHOW IT HARD.
OOH. OH, COME ON, DADDY.
FUCK ME. COME ON. OOH.
GLOW, LITTLE INCHWORM.
OH!
LOOK AT THOSE BALLS!
OH, DADDY! COME ON.
OOH, LOOK AT THAT POUT.
YEAH. OOH, COME ON.
OH, COME ON, LIEUTENANT.
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL NIGHT.
COME ON. OH, COME ON.
OOH! OOH! OH!
[MOANING]
DON'T BOTHER WITH THE HEAD.
THE "V" OF MY CROTCH
IS WHAT NEEDS THE ATTENTION.
BUT I CAN FUCK LIKE
A BANDIT, YOUR HIGHNESS.
WELL, RUB MY SAFETY
DEPOSIT BOX, THEN.
DIG FOR GOLD!
DIG FOR GOLD!
OH, YOUR HIGHNESS!
[YELLING]
GO, DADDY!
GO ALL NIGHT!
GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!
GET IT!
GET IT!
Woman: PRETTY OUTFITS.
Second woman:
HA HA HA!
FUNNY, IS IT?
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,
I WOULDN'T WEAR
THIS OUTFIT TO A DOG FIGHT.
MAYBE YOU TWO
HAVE RESIGNED YOURSELVES
TO A SUBHUMAN LIFE
IN THIS SLUM OF A TOWN,
BUT I, PEGGY GRAVEL,
HAVE NOT.
YOU BETTER HUSH UP
BEFORE MOLE
LOSES HER TEMPER
AND SMACKS YOU.
JUST SHUT UP, PEGGY.
NO, I WON'T SHUT UP.
YOU SHUT UP!
I'LL TELL YOU, MY BLUE BLOOD
IS ABOUT READY TO BOIL.
HEY! YOU LISTEN
TO ME, WACKO.
SEE THIS FIST?
I'M ABOUT READY TO USE
THAT HATCHET-FACE OF
YOURS AS A PUNCHING BAG.
NOW SIT DOWN
AND SHUT UP!
MOLE'S RIGHT, PEGGY.
I AM SICK OF LISTENIN'
TO YOUR BITCHIN'.
THE NEXT TIME YOU FEEL
A FIT COMIN' ON,
GO OUTSIDE AND BITCH.
BITCH AT THE AIR.
BITCH AT THE TREES.
BUT DON'T BITCH AT US!
BUT BITCHING ISN'T RELIEF
IF THERE'S NO ONE TO HEAR IT.
WELL,
WE CAN'T ALL BE
YOUR PSYCHIATRIST,
HONEY.
WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS
OF OUR OWN.
WELL, WHY ARE YOU
IN MORTVILLE?
OH, IT'S A LONG
UGLY STORY.
GO AHEAD, MUFFY.
TELL HER.
MAYBE SHE'D STOP FEELIN'
SORRY FOR HERSELF.
I WASN'T ALWAYS
LIKE THIS.
OH, I MEAN, OF
COURSE I WAS ALWAYS
VISUALLY STUNNING,
BUT I WAS MARRIED
TO A MAN,
AND I HAD A BABY
NAMED FREDDY.
IT WAS ABOUT
2 YEARS AGO,
AND MY HUSBAND AND I
WERE JUST RETURNING
FROM A COCKTAIL PARTY.
FROM A COCKTAIL PARTY.
Muffy: LET ME DRIVE!
Husband: GET OFF!
I CAN DRIVE!
ALWAYS TRYING
TO BOSS ME AROUND.
YOU'RE DRUNK,
AS PER USUAL.
AAH!
EVERY TIME WE STEP OUT OF
THE HOUSE, YOU GET DEAD DRUNK.
WHEN YOU'RE
MARRIED TO A NAG,
A MAN'S
GOT TO DRINK.
FIRST I HAVE TO BE MORTIFIED
IN FRONT OF OUR FRIENDS.
NOW I HAVE TO BE MORTIFIED
IN FRONT OF THE BABY-SITTER.
I SUPPOSE I'LL
HAVE TO DRIVE HER HOME.
I'LL TAKE HER.
YEAH, YOU'LL TAKE HER
STRAIGHT TO THE GRAVEYARD.
LET ME DRIVE!
GET OFF! I'LL TAKE HER!
Boy: CHECK IT OUT. HA!

THE REFRIGERATOR!
SO DON'T PAY ME!

DON'T PAY YOU?

OH, THAT'S

I CAN NEVER GO BACK.
I COULDN'T BEAR THE SHAME.
[SNIFFLES] AND YOU, MOLE,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
WELL, I'VE BEEN IN MORTVILLE
FOR 10 LONG YEARS,
AND I'LL TELL YA,
IT ISN'T VERY PRETTY WHAT
A TOWN WITHOUT PITY CAN DO.
WHAT BROUGHT ME HERE
WAS A CHAMPIONSHIP
WRESTLIN' MATCH.
IT WAS BACK IN 1966,
AND I WAS FIGHTIN' UNDER
THE NAME OF RASTLIN' RITA,
AND MY CHALLENGER
WAS BIG JIMMY DONG,
THE HUMAN BLOCKHEAD.
GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WELCOME TO RINGSIDE ARENA.

SITTIN' IN MY OWN STINK AND
TRYIN' TO FIGURE A WAY OUT.
BUT OUR LUCK'S GONNA
BE CHANGIN'. RIGHT, MUFF?
RIGHT, MOLE, WE'RE
GONNA WIN THAT LOTTERY.
I BELIEVE THAT WAS
OUR LOTTERY TICKET.
IT WAS YOURS, BUT YOU
RENTED A ROOM, ASSWIPE.
THAT TICKET'S MINE NOW.
WELL, YOU BETTER
GIVE US OUR SHARE.
WE NEED MONEY.
WE'RE NOT TRASH LIKE YOU.
WE'RE NOT USED TO
THIS LOW-CLASS LIFE.
I'LL WIPE THE FLOOR
WITH YOU!
BREAK IT UP!
BREAK IT UP!
RIP HER HEAD
RIGHT OFF!
THOSE LOTTERY TICKETS
AIN'T NO GOOD NO WAY.
THE ODDS ARE
A MILLION TO ONE.
DON'T SAY THAT!
YOU'LL HEX
OUR GOOD LUCK.
I'M WARNIN' YOU BOTH.
YOU BETTER STAY
OUT OF MY WAY,
'CAUSE WHEN OLD MOLE
GETS MEAN,
THERE'S NO TELLIN'
WHAT SHE'LL DO.
PEGGY, I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR BED.
NOW WE BOTH NEED
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.
OH, I'LL SLEEP,
ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE IN MY DREAMS I CAN FORGET
ABOUT THIS ROTTEN LITTLE TOWN
AND ITS DISGUSTING
POPULATION.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU TWO BELONG
IN MORTVILLE.
OH!

I COULD EAT CANCER.
[MOLE GASPS]
ISN'T THIS A GODSEND?
PUSSY BROUGHT DADDY

YOU KNOW NEWSPAPERS

BUT I SURE HOPE
YOU DO WIN.
THIS TOWN COULD STAND
A LITTLE GLAMOUR.
I TELL YOU,
I'M GETTIN' FED UP.
YEAH, WE'RE ALL
FED UP, SHINA.
AT LEAST YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PARTICIPATE
IN BACKWARDS DAY.
I KNOW! I'M SURPRISED
THE QUEEN DIDN'T ORDER ME
TO WEAR MY VAGINA
BACKWARDS.
[ALL LAUGHING]
EXCUSE ME, BUT
I MUST SEE HERBERT.
HERBERT, MY LOVE.
I HONOR YOU,

OH, COO.
I WORSHIP THE GROUND
YOU WALK ON.
I COULDN'T KEEP MY MIND
ON MY WORK ALL MORNIN'.
EVERY PIECE OF TRASH
I HAD TO PICK UP
REMINDED ME OF YOU.
AN OLD CANDY WRAPPER MADE ME
THINK OF HOW SWEET YOU ARE.
A SNOTTY KLEENEX MADE ME
REALIZE HOW MUCH I'D CRY
IF WE EVER HAD TO PART.
AN OLD RUBBER MADE ME THINK
OF ALL THE NIGHTS OF EROS
WE HAVE BEFORE US.
I LOVE YOU, COO-COO.
OH, HERBERT.
I MASTURBATED
14 TIMES LAST NIGHT
JUST THINKIN' OF YOU,

YOUR BODY HAS
A CERTAIN ODOR ABOUT IT
THAT ALWAYS ANNOYS ME!
AN ODOR,
YOUR MAJESTY?
YES, A WRETCHED STENCH.
I WASH DAILY,
YOUR MAJESTY.
WELL, WASH HARDER
IN THE FUTURE.
THERE IS
A NOTICEABLEODOR ZONE
SOMEWHERE ON YOUR BODY,
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU COULD LOCATE IT
AND DEODORIZE IT.
I'LL TRY AND CORRECT IT,
YOUR MAJESTY.
OH, WE CAN'T
ALL BE PERFECT,
LIEUTENANT GROGAN.
COME ON OVER HERE
AND SIT BESIDES MY FEET.
I HONOR YOU,
QUEEN CARLOTTA.
I HONOR YOU,
QUEEN CARLOTTA.
Queen: YOU HONOR ME,
BUT CERTAIN COMMONERS
IN THIS TOWN
OBVIOUSLY DON'T.
SOMEONE THREW A MUDBALL
AT ME TODAY.
IF ONLY I HAD A LITTLE
PINK BUTTON TO PUSH
THAT COULD WIPE OUT
THIS TOWN.
TELL ME,
IS IT POSSIBLE
TO GET ME
A HYDROGEN BOMB?
I DOUBT IT,
YOUR MAJESTY.
HOW ABOUT GERM WARFARE?
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?
YOU MEAN POISONING
THE POPULATION?
YES, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A FUN PROJECT.
HOW ABOUT RABIES?
COULD WE SPREAD THAT
DISEASE INEXPENSIVELY?
I THINK SO, YOUR MAJESTY.
ALL WE NEED
IS SOME RABID BAT PUS
TO MAKE A SERUM.
FINE! LET'S TRY IT.
RABID BAT PUS,
AND LET'S PUT IN
A LITTLE RAT PISS
FOR GOOD LUCK.
YOU'RE A GENIUS,
YOUR MAJESTY.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

OH! OH! W-WHAT--
YOUR MAJESTY, HERBERT
THE GARBAGE MAN IS DEAD,
AND THANKS TO THIS
NOBLE PEASANT WOMAN,
WE HAVE CAPTURED COO-COO

RELEASE THE PRISONERS!
OH, THANK YOU,
YOUR WONDERFUL MAJESTY!
YOU BILIOUS

I HEREBY PROCLAIM--
[TRUMPET BLARING]
OH, SHUT UP.
I HEREBY PROCLAIM
THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER
THE PRINCESS OF MORTVILLE.
YOU'LL BE GANG-RAPED
BY MY SOLDIERS,
INJECTED WITH RABIES,
AND EXILED TO
THE STREETS OF MORTVILLE
WHERE YOU BELONG!
I CONSIDER THAT
AN HONOR,
YOUR ROYAL HOGNESS,
TO ONCE AND FOR ALL
BE FREED
FROM THIS MOCKERY
OF A MONARCHY.
I WILL NEVER LIVE DOWN
THE SHAME
OF MY INHERITED NAME,
BUT I WILL DO MY BEST
TO SEE THAT YOU TOPPLE
FROM THE THRONE.
[SPITS]
SEIZE HER AND FUCK HER!
YEAH!
YEAH!

THAT WAS A COURAGEOUS
DECISION, YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU MAY STAND,

I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP
IN CAPTURING
MY DAUGHTER.
LOYALTY TO THE QUEEN
SOMETIMES RESULTS
IN REWARDS.
LET ME BE THE NEW PRINCESS,
YOUR MAJESTY.
I HAVE SEEN
THE HUMAN TRASH OF MORTVILLE,
AND I SHARE YOUR CONTEMPT
FOR THIS TOWN.
MY SUBJECTS ARE BENEATH
CONTEMPT, MRS. GRAVEL.
DEALING WITH THE POOR PEOPLE
IS A WASTE OF TIME.
ONLY THE RICH SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO LIVE!
I LIKE YOUR POLITICS,
MRS. GRAVEL.
AND TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I NEED A WOMAN LIKE YOURSELF
TO FOLLOW IN MY FOOTSTEPS.
IF YOU LOOKED ALL OVER
THIS LAND, YOUR MAJESTY,
I DOUBT YOU'D FIND
A WOMAN AS VICIOUS AS I.
WE'LL GIVE YOU A TRIAL RUN.
YOUR FIRST DUTY WILL BE
TO HELP MY SOLDIERS
SPREAD RABIES
TO EVERYONE IN TOWN.
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?
OH, YES, YOUR MAJESTY.
AND I KNOW JUST THE PERSON
I WANT TO GIVE IT TO FIRST.

I'LL FIX YOU ALL UP.
I'LL FIX YOU ALL UP.
I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE IT, MUFFY.
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED A MAN.
I JUST SAID THAT
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS.
I LIKE YOUR ORGANS
JUST THE WAY THEY WERE.
[WHIMPERS]
NOW--NOW I WON'T
HAVE ANY ORGANS.
IT'LL BE LIKE HAVING
A BARBIE-DOLL CROTCH.
OH, WHEN I GET THROUGH
WITH THESE STITCHES,
IT'LL BE CLOSE ENOUGH
IN MY BOOK.
CAREFUL.
THIS IS GONNA HURT.
WILL--WILL
YOU EVER BE ABLE
TO LOVE MY OPERATION?
OH, I'LL LOVE IT, MOLE.
I'LL FEEL IT.
I'LL LOVE IT.
I'LL EAT IT.

HI, YOUR MAJESTY.
[GASPS] HOLY SHIT, MOLE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
OH, MUFFY JUST
GAVE ME AN ABORTION.
OH, YOU WERE
PREGNANT, MOLE?
WELL, I--I WASN'T
GONNA TELL ANYBODY,
BUT I WAS RAPED
BY THOSE
LOTTERY OFFICIALS
WHEN I PICKED UP
MY MONEY.
[GASPS]
MEN ARE SUCH CUNTS.
OH, MEN, WOMEN,
THEY'RE ALL OK WITH ME
AS LONG
AS THEY'RE NUDE.
ALL THAT SUNSHINE MUST'VE
ROTTED YOUR BRAIN, SHINA.
YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING
MORE DISGUSTING
THAN A NUDE MAN.
HOW MANY TIMES
I GOTTA TELL YOU--
MEN ARE GENETIC REJECTS,
AND ALL THAT GRISTLE
THEY GOT HANGING DOWN
BETWEEN THEIR LEGS
WAS GOD'S
FIRST BIG MISTAKE,
AND US WOMAN HAVE BEEN
PAYING FOR IT EVER SINCE.
WHAT ISSHEDOING
IN MY HOME, ANYWAY?
OH, BE EASY

SHE'S BEEN
THROUGH HELL.
WHEN WE FOUND HER,
SHE WAS REGURGITATING
IN THE STREET.
YEAH, HER MOTHER THE HOG
HAD HER GANG-RAPED.
THE POOR THING'S
HAD A TERRIBLE TIME.
YOU KNOW THAT GRAVEL WOMAN
YOU WERE HANGING OUT WITH?
WELL, SHE WORKS
FOR THE QUEEN NOW.
SHE SHOT COO-COO UP
WITH A RABIES POTION.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
THAT SNOTTY LITTLE
SOCIAL CLIMBER.
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE
FRACTURED HER SKULL.
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING, COO-COO?
ARE YOU INFECTIOUS,
HONEY?
I DON'T KNOW.
MY SALIVA TASTES FUNNY,
AND I--I ITCH A LOT.
WELL, UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
WE'LL HAVE TO ASK
YOU TO REFRAIN
FROM USING OUR
KITCHEN UTENSILS.
Coo-Coo: I WON'T
BREATHE ON ANYTHING.
I PROMISE.
BUT PLEASE HELP ME
KILL MY MOTHER!
HOW'S PROJECT RABIES
COMING ALONG, PEGGY?
OH, I FEEL
JUST LIKE JONAS SALK.
TOMORROW IS THE FIRST DAY
OF MASS IMMUNIZATION,
OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
THE MORONS
OF MORTVILLE THINK.
OH, WON'T IT BE FUNNY
WHEN THEY START
COLLAPSING
ON THE STREET?
IT'LL BE LIKE WALKING
THROUGH A HUMAN SEWER.
OH, I HOPE I GET A CHANCE
TO KICK EVERY ONE OF 'EM
RIGHT IN THE HEAD
JUST AS THEY GASP
FOR THEIR LAST BREATH.
IT'LL BE BEAUTIFUL.
A SYMPHONY
OF DEATH RATTLES.
HISTORY WILL NOT FORGET
THIS HOLIDAY OF DEATH.
HISTORY WILL NOT FORGET

GO RIGHT AHEAD,

THE CHOMP OF LIFE.
Queen:
GET AWAY, CHILD.
LISTEN TO ME.
I'M YOUR MOTHER.
I'M WARNING YOU!
AAAAH!
AAAAAH!
OH, THANK HEAVENS.
YOU'VE RESCUED ME.
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER
GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE.
Mole: HA!
OH, COME OFF IT,
PRETTY LITTLE PEGGY.
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR YOUR LITTLE
DEBUTANTE PARTY IN HELL,
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE GOING!
YOU WOULDN'T
KILL A SISTER!
HA!
HA HA HA!
OH, YES, WE WOULD!
HOW ABOUT IT, GIRLS?
OH, YEAH.
YEAH.
SHOULD WE GIVE
OUR "SISTER"
A LITTLE RECTAL REMINDER
THAT WE DON'T LIKE
SOCIAL CLIMBERS
IN MORTVILLE?
I'M GONNA BLOW
YOUR BELLS OUT! HA HA.
GO AHEAD!
A SINGLE GUNSHOT
CAN NEVER DESTROY
THE BEAUTY

I INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME

-Jer, clean or dirty?
-Marginal.
No, it's not.
I don't know why you use that thing.
I mean, if it's for me, it's not necessary.
-Of course, I do like to watch you use it.
-I know.
Listen, I think we should wait with the powder room.
Nope, no more waiting for toilets.
I just don't like to see you worrying about loans and mortgages, that's all.
Then don't look.
I don't think we should spend money--
No more thinking tonight! Let's watch TV.
Is there any good mail today?
A couple of junk, some bills, and a letter for you.
Read this.
"God grants you an interview.
"1600 North Hope Street,
Los Angeles, California.
"Room 2700. Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m."
It's a gag.
No stamp, no return address?
Pretty crazy gag.
-It's an ad.
-For what?
For God oven cleaner, or God detergent, or I don't know.
Nobody would dare.
Air ball.
Artie Coogan.
-What?
-Artie Coogan, that's it.
Yeah.
Crazy Artie.
No, an English teacher wouldn't misspell "interview."
Neither would God.
I can't meet him tomorrow. I've got to meet the District Produce Manager.
-Sorry, God.
-Two points.
Did we make love last night?
Just checking.
Keep checking.
I love you.
Honey, it's so late.
That was two points.
-Wash your hands, Norman.
-We were just....
Good morning, Mr. McCarthy.
I'm sorry to be late, sir.
Landers. Hold it.
Is this how you've instructed your staff to prepare romaine lettuce for display?
I know what you're getting at, and I had the same argument...
-...with the last district manager.
-Please answer.
Yes, I do.
Why would anyone buy that...
...when they could get this for the same price?
Mr. McCarthy, if I put this head of lettuce in the bin, it's going to stay there all day...
...it'll be there tomorrow and the next day...
...and we will wind up throwing it away.
Our other stores--
They do not have a Ralph's up the street and a Lucky Market...
...right around the corner who trim even closer than I do.
Now, I know my customers, Mr. McCarthy.
I see.
Landers?
I also noticed that you haven't been oiling your cukes.
-What?
-Why haven't you been oiling your cukes?
It takes time, it takes oil, it's dishonest, Mr. McCarthy.
-Dishonest?
-Sir, there's an interview that I--
Look, our company has certain policies, which--
I have an interview with....
You have a what?
Thank you very much.
Stay.
What is this?
You're right on time, I like that.
Close the door.
-Who are you?
-You read the note.
-Who is that, Artie?
-God.
-Come on, Artie.
-No, it's me, God.
-God?
-Right, God.
God Almighty, Big "G".
It's not a gag, I promise.
-Where you going?
-I've got this load of plums coming in.
Let the plums wait.
How often do you talk with God?
Practically never.
How do I know you're God?
All I hear is a voice on an intercom.
You're not allowed to see me.
-Why not?
-Because.
-That's no answer.
-Sue me.
-If you're God....
-Yeah?
-If you're really God....
-Yeah?
If I'm really God, what?
-You leaving?
-Right the first time.
Where are you leaving?
Where do you think you are?
What do you mean, where?
Right here is where, that's where.
-And where is here?
-1600 North Hope Street, Room 2700.
Jerry.
There's no Room 2700 in this building.
There's no 27th floor here.
I thought, this way
we'd have a little privacy.
Check it out, Go ahead, I'll wait.
-Sir?
-Yes, sir?
How do I get to the 27th floor?
-In this building?
-Yeah.
I'm afraid you'd need a can opener.
We only have 17 floors.
Seventeen.
Have a nice ride?
Come in.
Close the door.
Sit down.
Go ahead.
Relax.
Don't smoke.
-I don't.
-Good.
Tobacco was one of my big mistakes.
-Mistakes?
-You try.
Ostriches were a mistake.
Silly looking things, Avocados.
Made the pit too big, Like I say, "You try."
You still don't believe it?
Artie, if this is you, you win.
-This is the best gag you've ever pulled.
-I'm not Artie.
Went to a lot of trouble to make it
a comfortable interview.
You misspelled it, you know.
-What?
-"Interview."
In your note.
It's "I"....
It's "I" before "E."
Give me a break, A few things, I got right.
I put summer before winter, didn't I?
You're scared.
Well, sure. But look, if this is a joke, it's gone too far.
It's no joke.
How come you've got such a....
Just a voice, like everybody's?
Empathy, I'm talking to you
in a way you can accept.
I'm relating.
I don't like to brag,
but if I appeared to you just as God...
...how I really am, what I really am,
your mind couldn't grasp it.
I think you made a mistake.
I'm not religious.
So?
I'm not one of your believers.
And I sure as heck don't believe this.
That's why I showed up.
Too many nonbelievers.
But I read in an article that religion is on the upswing.
Religion is easy, I'm talking about faith.
You're going to help me change that.
Me?
-I don't belong to any church.
-Neither do I.
Go back to work.
I don't want you to get in trouble.
Thank you.
We'll talk on the way.
-How?
-Trust me, Like it says on the money.
Sir? Are you all right, sir?
No.
Jerry.
-You want me to talk louder?
-Oh, God.
I thought you didn't believe in me?
That's just an expression.
I'm more than that,
and I want you to spread the word.
Me?
-Spread what word?
-That I am, I exist.
That we've spoken.
You want me to tell people that I've spoken with God?
-Yes.
-They'll put me away.
I'm tired of all the talk that I may be dead,
or that I never was at all.
Or that God was just
particles of cosmos, Gas.
I'm not gas, I found that very insulting.
-Do you actually expect people to believe--
-That's your job.
But I'm just a man. I'm no Moses.
What was Moses?
Do you think Moses was born on Page 1?
Moses was just a messenger,
my messenger.
Look....
God, if....
If I tell people that I spoke with God, they....
And now an oldie but a goodie,
Jerry Gray and A String of Pearls,
God?
Top-ten time on KGOD, What is it, Jerry?
That guy on the motorcycle thinks
I'm a nut. Is that the kind of God you are?
-How come you didn't let him hear you?
-That's a policy of mine.
I try not to work with
more than one savior at a time.
Savior? Me?
-You do your job right....
-I can't take this job. I don't believe--
I know, but even nonbelievers want
what they've got down here to work.
Have you read the papers lately?
It ain't working.
That's why I came, to tell everybody
I set the world up so it can work.
Only, it's up to you.
You can't look to me to do it for you.
No.
You can do it, It's only one message.
-Moses had to handle ten.
-But you gave him tablets.
-He had a bad memory.
-I need something.
What kind of something?
I don't know. Anything. A tape recording.
My voice wouldn't come out on tape.
It's very complicated.
It's like, you know how Dracula
can't see himself in a mirror?
It's along those lines.
If people could just hear your voice--
This isn't even how I sound, I'm talking
like this so that you'll understand me.
Understand? I don't understand anything.
That's a beginning, Over and out.
Hold it. Don't hang up on me.
You just went through a red light.
You're going to get yourself killed.
I need you down here.
I have some nice, fresh chicken soup.
Why don't you let me fix you a bowl?
Is that all I can get from you? Soup?
-You know what, darling?
-What?
Why don't you and I take a few days off and go on a little holiday?
-A holiday?
-Yeah.
We could go to San Francisco.
You haven't even seen your sister's new baby yet.
You don't want me to see my sister's baby.
You want me to see my sister's husband.
I am not crazy, and I don't need some child psychiatrist to tell me...
...that I didn't talk to God, because I did.
-On an intercom.
-And on the car radio.
Yes, Jerry.
Do you remember when Artie Coogan set up that hidden microphone...
...and he broadcast those filthy limericks through the television set?
It was not Artie.
I know all of Artie's voices.
Artie is not capable of adding 10 stories to a building that doesn't have them.
He cannot talk back and forth through a car radio...
...that's been busted for two months.
Whoever the hell this guy is, he's very smart.
And I'm going to listen to him.
-For a while.
-And you think it's God?
Well, he thinks he's God.
And I'm in no position to argue with him.
-I thought you believed in him.
-I do. I believe in God.
I just don't believe that he exists.
I mean, in the sense...
...that he repaints floor numbers in office buildings or doubles as a disc jockey.
Well, that is what he does.
And he wants you to give his message to the world?
Yes.
Jerry, does he know how you feel about him?
I told him. Doesn't seem to bother him.
So is that all he told you?
That you're going to be the savior?
And that to tell everybody, what we have down here can work?
Yes.
He also told me, he's very disappointed in avocados.
-He is?
-He said he made the pit too big.
I am not crazy!
Jerry?
I let you sleep a little later.
I'll take the kids to school, okay?
How do you feel?
You know, about....
I almost forgot. I'm fine.
Good.
Because, you know, I was thinking...
...you didn't actually see, all you did was hear.
And you know what they say.
-What?
-Seeing is believing.
Not hearing.
-What about Ingrid Bergman?
-Ingrid Bergman?
Joan of Arc. She played Joan of Arc.
Joan of Arc.
Joan didn't see either.
She just heard, like me.
Jerry?
-Oh, God.
-That's right.
-Is that you?
-In person.
-You're not on the radio?
-Have you got a radio out here?
-No.
-Bingo.
You're here?
-In my bathroom?
-Come take a look.
-I can't. I'm naked.
-You think I don't know what you've got?
That was another little goof of mine.
Shame.
I don't know why
I thought we needed shame.
Come on out.
Don't catch cold.
Not what you expected?
I picked a look you could understand.
For someone else,
I would've looked different.
I could do any face, voice, whatever.
I could even be a woman.
-Feeling a little strange?
-Very strange.
Like you're going to faint?
You know what's good for that?
Shaving.
-Shaving?
-Sometimes when you don't feel normal...
...doing a normal thing makes you feel normal.
Here, start shaving.
Go ahead.
I am.
I don't mean with the shaving...
...with the questions that are popping into your head.
Yeah.
-Why me?
-Why not you?
You mean, there's no special--
Life is a crap shoot, like the millionth customer who crosses a bridge...
...gets to shake hands with the governor.
You thought I picked you because you're better than everybody?
I'm not?
You're better than some, but not as good as others.
But you crossed the bridge at the right time.
If you wanted to see me, why didn't you just appear over my bed?
Hollywood. Next question.
People are always praying to you.
Do you listen?
I can't help hearing. I don't always listen.
-Then you don't care?
-Of course I care.
I care plenty. But what can I do?
What can you do?
You're God.
Only for the big picture.
I don't get into details.
Then whatever happens to us--
Happens. Here, I put in a new blade.
You mean, there's no plan...
...no scheme to guide our destinies?
-A lot of it is luck.
-Luck? Just luck?
Put on a little toilet paper.
I'll get you a piece.
-You don't control our lives?
-I gave you a world and everything in it.
It's all up to you.
-But we need help.
-That's why I gave you each other. Here.
With your powers, you could solve so many problems.
Don't wet it.
-Are you sure?
-Am I sure?
Did I do a good job on the Grand Canyon?
Anyway, why don't you?
Solve all our problems.
-Work a few miracles.
-I don't do miracles. They're too flashy.
And they upset the natural balance.
No miracles? I knew it.
Maybe now and then, just to keep my hand in.
The last miracle I did was the 1969 Mets.
Before that,
I think you have to go back to the Red Sea.
That was a beauty.
No offense, but I don't believe the Red Sea...
...and I don't believe six days to create the world.
You're right.
-I am?
-Tell you the truth...
...I thought about it for five days and did the whole job in one.
I'm really best under pressure.
-One day to create the world?
-And the sun. I hate to work in the dark.
You have to remember...
...that one of my days is not exactly one of yours.
How long are they?
When I got up this morning,
Sigmund Freud was still in medical school.
-If you're so involved with us....
-Yeah?
How can you permit all the suffering that goes on in the world?
-How can I permit the suffering?
-Yeah.
I don't permit the suffering. You do.
Free will. All the choices are yours.
Choices? What choices?
You can love, cherish and nurture each other, or you can kill each other.
Incidentally, "kill" is the word.
It's not "waste."
If I meant "waste," I would have written,
"Thou shalt not waste."
You're doing some very funny things with words here.
You're also turning the sky into mud.
I look down, I don't believe the filth.
Using rivers for toilets, poisoning my fishes.
You want a miracle?
You make a fish from scratch. You can't.
You think only God can make a tree?
Try coming up with a mackerel.
And when the last one is gone, that'll be that.
Eighty-six on the fishes. Good-bye, sky.
So long, world. Over and out.
-I thought you said we would make it.
-I said, you have to make it work.
-You don't care.
-I do care.
-Then do something about it.
-I did. I got you to carry the ball.
-I got no ball. How can I carry it?
-I gave you a mouth, didn't l?
Tell people how I feel, what I said.
How do I do that?
How did you get to be an assistant manager?
Did you ever hear of newspapers, reporters?
You got a scoop here, an exclusive, a hold-the-presses.
Fine.
And how do I convince anybody that I've actually seen you?
-That you exist?
-Simple.
Show them this.
-Your card?
-No, it's not my card. It's God's card.
-It's God's card?
-Look at it.
I am.
-Do you know where I got it?
-At a novelty store?
-God gave it to me.
-Did he?
-May I ask when and where you got it?
-This morning, in my bathroom.
God visited you in your bathroom this morning?
Yes.
Sounds crazy to you, doesn't it?
Yesterday, he was just a voice on an intercom...
...and then he was on the radio.
-God spoke to you on the radio?
-In my car.
-What station?
-All stations.
Right. And then this morning, he showed up in your bathroom?
Yes.
Why do you suppose the Almighty spoke to you, Mr.--
-Landers.
-Mr. Landers.
Jerry Landers. He said that he wanted me to be his messenger, like Moses.
What sort of work do you do, Mr. Landers?
I'm the assistant manager of Food World in Burbank.
I see. Then you don't speak to God every day.
Never before yesterday.
Did God say why he needed a messenger...
-...at this particular time, Mr. Landers?
-Yes, he was very specific.
He said that he wanted us to know that it can work.
-What "it" is that?
-Us "it."
Our lives, our world, everything.
He says that he's given us everything that we need, and it's entirely up to us.
-And those were his exact words?
-Close enough. You can print that.
Did God specify the Los Angeles Times?
That was my idea.
Well, we're very grateful.
I'm not a nut.
-I didn't say that you were.
-I'm not even religious.
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Landers, for bringing us this story.
Look, don't brush me off.
Do me a favor, and look at that card again.
Take a good hard look at it.
Certainly.
Now, does that look like something
I'd get at a novelty shop?
Yes.
Norman, did you just put a bag of potatoes on top of that white bread?
No, sir.
-I think you did.
-Mr, Landers, please come to Aisle 10.
Aisle 10, please.
Did you hear that, Norman?
Yes, never put a bag of potatoes on top of a white bread.
No, the page. I was just paged.
Did you hear that?
I didn't hear anything. Did l?
We'll get you a new white bread, ma'am.
Take care of it.
God?
Chemicals, all chemicals.
Turning kids into garbage cans.
Jerry, I didn't see one word in the newspapers.
Of course not.
That guy at the Times kept looking at me like I was some kind of lunatic.
And I felt like one.
-Did you show him my card?
-Sure I did.
And he said, "You can get one of those in any novelty store."
Here. You know, I really felt like an idiot.
Please, don't do that to me again.
-You said what I said?
-Absolutely.
And they didn't find God's word fit to print?
Some tough cookies, boy.
-Did you get the Coke?
-Yes.
I have Cup-a-Soup.
-Good morning, Mrs. Levin.
-Hi.
-Mrs. Green.
-Hi, Jerry.
You know, I'd like you to meet....
-You did it to me again.
-What'd she do?
What?
Nothing.
-Can I help you ladies?
-No.
-We're all right.
-Yes, thank you.
-What was that all about?
-I don't know.
-Why did you change on me?
-Why did you start to introduce me?
I don't want to be the only guy in the world--
Look, I can't make appearances all over.
Don't you understand?
-No, I don't.
-People would drop dead from hysterics.
-Mr. Landers?
-This place is too busy.
Can you sign this, please?
Jerry?
Up here.
-Let's go for a ride.
-I'll meet you.
-Where?
-What? Not you.
I can't understand it. Why wouldn't a religious editor believe you?
Face it, you goofed again, just like the avocado pit.
You picked the wrong message boy.
-You don't believe I'm here, do you?
-No, I don't.
Then how do you explain this conversation we're having?
I'm having. I'm dreaming you.
And I ought to be real glad when I wake up, too.
What color are my eyes?
My eyes?
Blue.
My shirt?
Red plaid.
What does that got to do with anything?
-Do you dream in color?
-No.
Bingo, again.
Okay. All right.
You know a lot of things...
...and you've been making things happen...
...but none of it seems....
-Godlike?
-Yeah. Godlike.
Now, what, to you, would be Godlike?
-Change the weather.
-Special effects?
What would you like?
A little earthquake? Small hurricane?
No, I wouldn't want anybody hurt.
I was just thinking, maybe, what about a little rain?
-Little rain?
-Yeah. A small shower.
One small shower. You got it.
It's raining.
You made it rain.
You didn't even bat an eye.
You didn't lift a finger.
-Rain's not that hard.
-It's unbelievable.
-Would you like it to rain a little harder?
-No, this is fine.
-How about bigger drops?
-No. This is fine.
Would you care for a little snow?
I don't believe it.
It's not raining outside. It's just in here.
Why should I spoil everybody's day?
-This is fantastic.
-Thank you.
-It's just like Noah's ark.
-Same thing, without the smell.
-What's the problem, officer?
-I was about to ask you.
My radiator must be leaking.
I'm sorry about that.
A radiator doesn't hold that much water.
I must have driven through a car wash with my windows open?
-That'd do it.
-Yeah.
-Roll up the windows next time.
-Yes, sir, I will. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
-He believed that dumb excuse.
-There's an aura of goodness around you.
You.
Going to try a little harder to get the word out?
-Yeah! I'll give it another shot!
-That's my boy.
Mr. Briggs.
-You're all wet.
-Of course I'm wet.
I didn't dry myself, I wanted you to see this. Do you remember me?
Of course. You're the nonbeliever who spoke to God, twice, I believe.
Four times, now.
-Is he still visiting you in the toilet?
-I just rode with him in my car.
This time, I have got the proof.
-He gave you another calling card?
-No. He made it rain inside the car.
This water that I'm dripping all over here is water that he made.
This is holy water.
-If you'll excuse me, I really am in a hurry.
-I will not excuse you, Mr. Briggs!
You are a reporter of religious events...
...and this is the most important religious event of our time.
And I expect you....
I don't expect, I insist, that you print his message...
...in your paper and give it the prominence it deserves.
Or, by God, you'll hear from me again.
Jerry.
No, listen to this.
"It should come as no surprise to anyone that in these tense-filled times...
"...religious freaks abound.
"From the Bronx cabbie who claims he drove Mary Magdalene...
"...to the airport last Christmas...." Listen.
"To the Burbank, California, supermarket manager...
"...who insists he has had four conversations with God, no less."
What?
"According to this second gentleman...
"...who flashes a calling card with God's name on it...
"...God wants very much for us to know...
"...He is alive and well and that our world can work. It's up to us."
Let me see that.
The Los Angeles Times.
-Where is it?
-How could you, for God's....
It's right here, with some terrific company.
See this? A janitor who sleeps all night tied up on a cross.
Did anybody else say they saw God?
No, but there's an insurance salesman selling life-after-death policies.
But only you have talked to the Big Boss.
Did you just say that you saw him?
-Yes.
-You didn't just hear him?
One line. That's all they gave it is one line.
-Are you saying now that you saw God?
-Three times, yeah.
-Three times?
-In the bathroom, at work, and in the car.
One lousy line. I don't believe it.
Let's go away for a couple days, okay?
-Bobbie, I know how crazy this all sounds.
-No, you don't.
I saw him. He spoke to me.
All right, let's say, for a minute, that you saw God--
Look, don't humor me.
That'll really make me crazy.
Okay! You saw him.
-But why is he talking to you?
-Why not me?
Why not the Pope, or Billy Graham, or somebody way up there?
-He doesn't care about religion.
-God doesn't care about religion?
That's what he said.
He sure picked a funny business to go into then, didn't he?
I'm sorry, Jerry.
I can't seem to accept the concept of you...
...actually having a real, honest-to-God conversation with God.
I don't understand why he wanted to talk to you.
God, listen to me, this whole thing is making me nuts now, too.
Too?
-You do think I'm crazy.
-No.
I don't think you're crazy.
Which is why I think I'm crazy.
Bobbie, how can I convince anyone at all, if I can't convince you?
Jerry, for some reason that I can't even begin to fathom...
...you really believe all this stuff, don't you?
Can't you?
I believe...
...that you believe.
Which, in some sense, is the same as believing, I guess, isn't it?
Do you understand what I've said?
Do you have any questions?
Adam?
Sounds pretty bananas, Dad.
Hello?
Who?
No, he isn't home right now.
No, that's not him.
Yes, you can print that in your paper.
He is definitely not the man in the Times today.
-Can I go now, Dad?
-Sure, Son.
I'll meet you.
Look, I'm his wife. You can believe me.
Don't call back.
-What do you think?
-Maybe he's going through a stage.
You know, "mentalpause."
That's "menopause."
-Yeah, like Grandma.
-I hope.
And finally, this note.
The Los Angeles Sunday Times reports
today that in Tarzana, California...
...a supermarket manager, Jerry Landers,
had an alleged conversation...
...with someone he claimed was God.
According to the story,
God has appeared on earth to reaffirm...
...that He lives and our world can work.
It's up to us.
This reporter would like to hedge his bets
on the outside chance...
...that God did make this appearance
and that he just might be tuned to ABC.
We'd like him to know, we did report it.
This is Jerry Dunphy.
Thank you and good night.
-Even Moses didn't give his last name.
-That should get the phone ringing.
I told you.
Hello.
Yes, this is Jerry Landers.
It's the Tarzana Daily Review.
Yes, I'm the one.
Spoke with him? Absolutely.
About 6 foot, blondish hair....
Oh, him.
About 5' 7", I guess. Gray hair.
-I almost forgot my project.
-Jerry.
-I'm coming!
-You made the front page.
What?
-Everybody, look.
-What?
Channel 11? That's the 10:00 news.
-Can we stay up and watch us?
-Jerry, I don't want the kids on TV.
Can't be any worse than watching it.
Don't worry. Come on, kids.
Hold the cameras.
-Mr, Landers?
-Yes.
Channel 11, 10:00 news.
You're quoted as saying
that you've talked with God, sir?
Yes.
-Face to face?
-That's right.
He's a fruitcake.
And you say God wants to affirm he's alive
and he's very disappointed...
-...with the way we're handling our world?
-That's right.
How are you going to get people
to believe you?
It wasn't my idea.
He picked me.
Is God going to reveal himself to you, as you claim he has?
Not as I claim he has. As he has.
I don't know if he'll show up again, but he gave me his message and--
-Dad. It's 10 to.
-Yes, Adam.
That he exists?
Yes, and that he would like us to cherish and nurture each other...
-...as opposed to killing one another.
-He said that?
Yeah, that he's our shepherd,
and we shall not want.
-We can quote you?
-I didn't make that up.
For 10:00 news, this is Mario Machado
and the man who talked to God in Tarzana.
The second time,
the first time was in Los Angeles.
I stand corrected.
Mr, Landers, please call
Mr, Summers at his office.
Mr, Summers for Mr, Landers.
-Landers.
-Mr. Summers.
Glad you could get here so fast.
-Well, you said--
-Right, have a seat.
Thank you.
-How's it going, Landers?
-Fine.
-You took over while Slavic is vacationing?
-Yes, sir.
-Think you can handle a store as manager?
-I'm sure I can.
Good.
-Everything all right at home?
-Wonderful.
The missus? Kids? Adam? Betsy?
Becky.
Good, what is this "seeing God" crap all about?
It's not crap, Mr. Summers. I've seen him.
I've heard it all in this chair.
I know what being a manager can do to a man.
Trouble with books.
-Humping check-out girls in the freezer.
-I'm only the assistant.
You can tell me.
There's nothing like that to tell.
I really have seen him.
Landers, the founder and principal stockholder of Food World...
...is a man devoted to prayer.
Lowell Wilson has personally gotten down on his knees...
...with three US Presidents.
He attended prayer breakfasts and asked for God's blessing...
...with the Joint Chiefs of Staff right in the war room of the Pentagon.
I don't think that Mr. Wilson is going to take too kindly to the idea...
...that one of his employees...
...is claiming to have had a personal audience with the Almighty himself.
I should think that he would be very happy to know that his prayers are heard.
Mr. Wilson has reached that point in his life...
...where he can be sure his prayers are heard.
He doesn't need any help from you.
It's not me. I'm just kind of like a Moses.
Look, Landers.
I don't want to pump any sunshine up your skirt...
...but you have a future at Food World.
Don't blow it.
Now, you just keep your mouth shut, and stay away from reporters.
And if I don't?
God may have been interested in you as an assistant manager...
...we'll just see how he feels about you as a bag stuffer.
Over here!
I thought I'd straighten up a little.
The mess people make.
Take a seat.
It's started?
You said you saw me, and the pressure started.
-Is it going to get any worse?
-How should I know?
What do you mean, how should you know?
-How could I know?
-You know everything.
I only know what is.
Also, I'm very big on what was.
On what isn't yet, I haven't got a clue.
-But when you said--
-Move your foot.
Sit down.
When you said everything would work out...
...I thought you could tell the future.
Absolutely, I could tell the future, the minute it becomes the past.
I said, everything could work out, if that's everybody's choice.
People have to decide what's to be done with the world.
I can't make a personal decision for everybody.
Why the face? So far, so good.
We hit the papers, a little TV, we're in business.
I'm liable to lose my job.
Lose a job, save a world. Not a bad deal.
Hey, Adam.
-What are you doing here?
-I got off early from work, Son.
I thought I'd give you a lift home.
No thanks, Dad. I'll walk.
-Come on.
-No, I got new tennis shoes on.
I want to break them in.
See you later.
Come on, let's go.
Why wouldn't they be embarrassed?
-Their friends ribbed the hell out of them.
-That's rotten.
They wanted to know if you could get their test answers from God.
And could he do anything about their little-league team?
They gave them a very rough day.
Jerry, what are you going to do about Mr. Summers?
What can I do?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to say no more about it, like he said not to.
Bobbie,
Mr. Summers represents Food World.
God is with "World World."
It's a slightly bigger obligation.
-Bigger than your job?
-I have no choice.
That's the problem.
The problem is, you do!
How far do you intend to take this?
How long is this going to go on?
Until everyone gets the message.
Until I can convince people of this miracle.
I mean, that's what it is.
It's a miracle, nothing less.
I have to reach the greatest number of people possible and tell them.
It's for you.
The producer of The Dinah Shore Show.
You've been on television a long....
Not that long. I'm sorry.
No, I'm much younger than I look.
-No, I didn't want to say it that way.
-You look....
I'm younger than people think I am, because I've been around a long time.
Everything you've done has had such tremendous impact.
It's been magnificent.
I've never done anything bad in my life.
I'm one of the perfect people.
-That's kind of exciting.
-It is.
Do you remember your first moment
on television?
Actually, I do, It was in 1948.
It was Maggie McNellis's Crystal Room.
We were told to be visual in those days.
The Picture of Dorian Grey
was very popular then.
I gave a 15-second impression
of The Picture of Dorian Grey,
About the man who carouses.
He stays looking good,
but his picture falls apart.
-Ready, Mr. Landers?
-Right.
I think I broke a jaw.
America is not ready for this.
Okay, you'll take the empty seat next to Dinah.
-This show is taped, isn't it?
-Yes, it'll be on a week from today.
You may have read about my next guest in the newspapers recently.
He is a supermarket manager from Tarzana, California...
...who says that he has been instructed by God to spread the message...
...that God lives and God cares.
Please welcome Mr. Jerry Landers.
-Am I on?
-Almost, that applause is for you.
-Is Dinah nice, Daddy?
-Not now, honey.
-You're not nervous, are you?
-No.
I don't mind telling you, I am.
You have some pretty powerful friend.
-Why are they laughing?
-Just watch.
Because God is Daddy's friend.
-Why do you suppose he picked you, Jerry?
-God only knows, I mean....
You're right.
You said that God wants us to know
that he still cares.
Is there anything else
that he wants us to know?
Yes, that he's given us everything
that we need to make our life work...
...make the world work,
and that he's watching us.
-He's watching?
-Yes.
Watching us?
-Now?
-Yes.
You agreed earlier
to be part of an experiment today...
...with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Do you want me
to take a lie detector test?
-No.
-I will.
What this is, is a sketch artist
from the Los Angeles Police Department.
He's an expert and very adept
at making a sketch from a description.
I think all of us here would like to know
what God looks like.
You would like to know.
-Shall we?
-Okay.
Follow me.
-Jerry, this is Mr, Fernando Ponce.
-Hello, sir.
-Please sit there.
-Thank you.
Mr, Ponce, as I said, is an expert
at eyewitness sketches...
...for the LA Police Department.
-How do I start?
-Tell me about the shape of his face.
The shape is...
...triangular.
-Good.
-I guess.
-He's got large ears.
-He has?
Jerry, I don't believe you actually did this.
It was their idea.
He does, He wears glasses.
God wears glasses?
He's wearing a fishing cap.
-A fishing cap?
-Maybe it's like a baseball cap.
His lips are kind of thin.
His nose is straight.
It's round on the ends.
No one's supposed to know what God looks like.
-I do.
-You do?
Yeah. In Bible Comics, they had a picture of him last week.
They're horn-rimmed glasses.
They're plastic ones, you know?
Where would you suppose
he would get his glasses?
I don't know.
-Anywhere he likes.
-Yeah.
Boy, I sure hope my friends are doing their homework.
This is what God looked like to you?
He's sort of captured the sense...
...I guess.
America, here it is...
...as seen through the eyes
of Jerry Landers.
God.
Dad, you're going to get God arrested.
-You said it would be done by 6:00.
-I'm sorry, but I just got the part.
-Weren't you on the Dinah Show last night?
-Yeah.
Yeah, that was real different.
Excuse me.
How am I supposed to get home now?
Where to, mister?
Get in.
I hope you have a license.
-Did you watch Dinah Shore last night?
-I watch everything.
I got you national exposure.
I hope you're happy.
I could be happier.
How?
For starters, you do a show like that...
...you don't let them put you on the last few minutes.
That's for fellas who write diet books.
It wasn't up to me.
And what was that drawing thing?
-He was a police artist.
-Man draws crooks.
Makes everybody look like a crook.
Made me look like a second-story man.
-It's publicity.
-I'm used to a little better treatment.
That painting of me by Michelangelo, that's a picture.
And he did it laying flat on his back.
Now what happens?
Now we see who can still believe, who wants to, who needs to.
A few million people saw you last night, right?
A few million?
Some of them will believe you.
Some are going to want to punch me in the head.
Some will want to fire me.
Some may decide
I'm too crazy to live with.
We can't worry about those.
The ball is rolling.
-Yeah, right over me.
-Don't be a malcontent, I'll watch over you.
While you're watching over me, would you mind watching the road?
I'd rather watch a nice sunset.
Dinah Shore must get a pretty big rating.
You're on, kid.
-Jerry?
-Yes, God?
You have the strength that comes from knowing.
Can I have one minute with you?
I have something very important to say.
It just can't wait.
Please, bless my baby.
Touch him, pray for him. Pray for my baby.
If I could just have one second with you....
-It's not for me, it's for you.
-Sanctify my body.
Bless him, make him a true believer!
I have something very important.
This is for you!
-Give me your golden staff.
-I can't!
-God said it's okay.
-I'll tell you this, it's very important!
Officer, could you move the rest of them along?
Yes, sir.
One little moment, please.
What I have to tell him is--
Okay.
I went to empty the garbage, and two people blessed me.
Then one of them blessed the garbage.
And then he asked me if our children were conceived immaculately.
Now, calm down, honey.
The police had to take our kids to school today.
-They said it was safer.
-That's awful!
Yes, that's awful.
You want to hear awfuller?
Mr. Summers said that Lowell Wilson...
...is personally deciding whether or not you can keep your job.
Is that awful enough for you?
Now, Bobbie, don't let it get to you.
Don't let it get to me?
Jerry, it's gotten to me! Don't you see?
Jerry, look, you've got him to talk to.
It's just me here, me and those religious nuts outside!
I have to leave the phone off the hook.
People keep calling up and asking to talk to God.
Except, of course, for the guy who offered to chew on my pantyhose!
Telegrams, notes in the mail box and the doorways.
Today they even put one in the dog's mouth.
This is from the university.
I've been invited to appear before a theology group.
-They want to verify the miracle.
-Terrific.
It is! This'll give me credibility,
and God'll get his word across.
It'll help me keep my job.
Mr. Landers, it is the consensus of this group...
...that you are a person of little or no theological knowledge.
You have demonstrated, over the years...
...an astonishing lack of interest in spiritual matters.
It strikes me, as one who has actually heard his voice...
...that you have virtually no prerequisites to make direct contact...
-...with the Almighty, whatsoever.
-You've heard him?
He has made his word known to me.
What was he wearing?
I know his word through the scriptures.
It would be blasphemy to suggest...
...that we could describe the Creator in human terms.
Why?
If He created us...
...why wouldn't he appear to us as one of us?
Don't you....
Don't you, young man...
...try to teach this assemblage the role of the Deity.
Rabbi Silverstone, my good and great friend...
...brother in the work of the Lord, with whom we have broke bread many times...
...is a pillar of the American Jew community.
Bishop Reardon represents millions of Roman Catholics.
Bishop Marcos, multitudes of Greek Orthodoxers.
Why, we have virtually every religious persuasion...
...represented here today.
And I personally have been chosen...
...to render the benediction at this year's Super Bowl.
Mr. Landers, we really find insufficient documentation...
...to support your claim.
But you're not saying it didn't happen.
No, we are saying there is insufficient documentation.
Which puts the score at God 7, you 0.
We have decided, however, out of a sense of fairness...
...and ecclesiastical curiosity...
...to allow you to present us with certain evidence.
What evidence?
We have assembled a set of questions...
...for you to ask God.
There are 50 questions.
Fifty.
You want me to get God to take a quiz?
Unless you've been concealing an abundant knowledge--
Which I find highly doubtful.
There are questions there that you could not possibly answer.
Look, I don't know when...
...or if he'll ever appear again.
As a control measure, you will remain locked in your hotel room...
...alone.
-Not even my wife?
-No.
There'll be no outside calls, whatsoever.
You could, of course, decline.
But then, that would form the basis of our report.
God?
-God?
-Room service.
Just put it right around over here, please.
You can't come in. I understand.
Do I need to sign this?
Thank you very much.
-They forgot the ketchup.
-Come in!
They're playing our number.
$11 for a steak? Who would have thought?
With me, cows were an afterthought.
Just to give new mothers a little rest.
-Boy, am I glad to see you.
-Eat. It'll get cold.
Pretty cute.
-What is it?
-They made sure you couldn't answer.
The questions are in the ancient tongue of Aramaic.
Is that what that is?
They've figured out so many ways to talk to each other, they're finding nobody can.
Let's see.
"What's the true origin of the universe?
"What is the source of the planet Earth?"
It's a History final, right?
So many repeats.
Eat the steak, and then get a pen.
"Did man fall from grace in the Garden of Eden?"
I'll tell you something, never came out.
I made Adam 17.
Eve was 15, 16, tops.
I figured then,
16, 17 was middle-age, you know.
Who knew people would live so long?
Trees, I figured they had the best chance.
Now I realize that they were kids, babies.
Young people can't fall from my grace.
They're my best things. Put that down.
-"Which of the world's--"
-Wait.
Okay.
"Which of the world's religions is the closest to the divine truth?"
The divine truth is not in a building or a book or a story.
Put down that the heart is the temple wherein all truth resides.
"Is Jesus Christ the son of God?"
Jesus was my son.
Buddha was my son.
Mohammed, Moses, you...
...the man who said there was no room in the inn was my son.
So is the one who charges $11 for steak in this one.
Let's mush on.
What was that last question?
-"Will there--"
-"Will there be a judgment day for man?"
If they mean a doomsday, an end-of-the-world thing...
...I'm certainly not going to get into that.
But if you want my personal opinion,
I wouldn't look forward to it.
There'd be a lot of yelling, and I don't need that anymore than you do.
Got that?
Got it.
"What is the meaning of man's existence?"
Life is like a glass of tea.
No, I better not go for laughs.
Voltaire may have had me pegged, right?
He said I was a comedian playing to an audience who's afraid to laugh.
But seriously, put down that man and women-persons...
...their existence means exactly and precisely...
...not more, not one tiny bit less, just what they think it means.
What I think doesn't count at all.
-That's very profound.
-Sometimes I get lucky.
-Last question.
-Thank God.
You're welcome.
"Why have you chosen to appear at this time?"
You've already said.
Maybe they want to hear it in your own words.
I want to say to everyone that everything around them that they see and smell...
...and feel and hear, they should delight in all this.
That what is here are some of my very best ideas.
I want everyone to try very hard...
...to make sure it doesn't all go down the drain.
Give me, I'll do it.
Can you remember exactly what you said?
It was perfect.
Boy, these answers are really going to get them.
That's my handwriting! lmagine that.
Shall I call the panel and tell them I'm ready?
Never mind the panel.
You deliver those papers to Rev. Williams...
-...the one who looks like a football player.
-I didn't like him.
He's having one of his big dos at the Shrine Auditorium.
Every time I turn around, he's spreading the word, my word.
Only, my words he ran out of years ago.
I'll tell you the truth.
The reason I put everybody here naked...
...I wasn't trying to be cute,
I just didn't want to create clothes.
With clothes, there's right away pockets, and you have to put something in them.
You take these, and give them to Rev. Bigmouth.
Tell him that God says he's a phony.
Also, tell him if he wants to get rich, fine.
Tell him to sell Earth Shoes.
But personally tell him
I'd like him to shut up. I'll see you.
God?
Yeah?
-Thank you.
-Hope I get an "A."
Love.
Let's talk about love.
What is it?
You can love your brother, can't you?
You can love your wife or your husband.
You can love your new dress.
You can love my new car.
You can pass by a pet shop...
...and say, "I just love
that little doggie in the window, "
You can love this, and you can love that.
But what am I talking about?
Some folks say...
...that love is what they saw
in a pornographic movie.
But that is lust, not love.
-Is that what you want?
-No!
-Is that love?
-No!
-Is that what the Bible teaches?
-No!
-Is that what I'm talking about?
-No!
No, because what I'm talking about
is the kind of love...
...that calls for a sacrifice.
Are you willing to make a sacrifice...
...to show God how much you love him?
Yes!
To show God how you love him
with all of your heart and soul?
Yes!
-How do we love God? With all our....
-Hearts!
-How do we love God? With all our....
-Souls!
-Is that what I'm talking about?
-Yes!
Yes, amen, I say, yes!
-Raise your right hand, and say amen!
-Amen!
-Say amen!
-Amen!
And you can show God how you love him...
...by digging down deep...
...so that this ministry will reach
all of the people of the earth!
Because the Bible tells us:
"Show God you love him,
and he will show you the way, "
Amen!
Now, I'm going to ask all of you
to come up.
Those of you who haven't come up before...
...I'm going to ask you to come up for God.
Shake my hand,
and let God see us together.
Because the Bible tells us...
...that God knows the falling of a sparrow...
...and the depth of a pocket,
and that is what I'm talking about!
Amen!
Come up, brothers and sisters...
...and put in our hands
what you would put in God's hands...
...and he will have the whole world
in his hands!
"He's got the whole world in his hands
"He's got the whole world in his hands
"He's got the whole world in his hands
"He's got the whole world..."
May the Lord bless and keep you.
It's so good to see you.
You can put that right--
Yes, thank you very much. God bless you.
May the Lord always bless you and keep you. It's so good to see you.
Thank you, please keep moving.
-Rev. Williams.
-That's all right.
He is in need of me.
What are you doing here?
-God sent me to you.
-One moment!
Ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters...
...this is the young man
who has used so much energy...
...to convince everyone
that he has seen God.
Now, wait!
Would you repeat
what you just said to me?
God sent me to you.
God sent him to me!
-Are you certain of that?
-Yes, I just left him.
He wanted me to give you these answers
to all of those questions.
-God specified me?
-Yes.
And he also asked me to tell you
that he's very unhappy.
God is very unhappy.
Yes, he's unhappy that you're
getting rich this way.
And that he'd like you to stop pretending
that you're spreading his word.
In fact, he suggested that you sell shoes.
That's what he said! You're a fake!
This poor boy is ill.
Get him out of here!
Rev. Williams!
Slander, Your Honor.
Slander, surely, cruel and foul.
The Rev. Willie Williams is on the road for God...
...to the tune of 100,000 miles a year.
He's a tireless, selfless servant of the Lord.
The idea that he'd line his pockets in this pursuit is the unkindest cut of all.
Not only is Willie Williams' organization nonprofit...
...he personally pays over six figures in income tax every year.
Give him back his honor, Your Honor.
Award him the damages we seek from this defendant.
A man so out of touch with reality...
...he even tries to smear the good name of a religious giant.
A man whom the President of the United States once called...
..."God's own quarterback."
Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Landers, will you come to the bench, please?
-You haven't changed your mind?
-No, sir.
A professional lawyer would be helpful.
This is a tough time for you to be alone.
I won't be alone, sir.
-They're just going to kill you today, Jerry.
-We'll see.
We're going to lose everything you worked for. lsn't there any way you can say you're sorry?
That it was all a big mistake?
No, because I'm not, and it wasn't.
I just can't believe that God would set me up...
...to get me into all of this trouble.
I have to believe that he had a reason...
...and I have to believe
that he'll bail me out.
And all I want to say is,
that young man is out of his mind.
And the absolute being, the all-powerful, all-knowing, all-merciful...
...infinite spirit, the supreme soul...
...the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords...
...the infinite, everlasting eternal being...
...last came to you how?
As a busboy.
Your Honor, I rest my case.
You may step down now, Mr. Landers.
Call your witnesses, please, Mr. Landers.
Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call one witness and one witness only.
I'm waiting, Mr. Landers.
Yes.
Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand the Lord God.
I object. The defendant's trying to make a mockery of this proceeding.
Your Honor, I was trying to make a point.
-What point?
-Your Honor...
...when I just asked God to take the stand...
...in that brief moment after I called him, wasn't there a trace of expectation?
Just a trace, Your Honor?
Wasn't there a hesitation in this room?
Didn't you feel it?
Didn't we all feel it?
It was the possibility that God does exist.
And if he exists, he could materialize and sit right in that chair.
In that moment, Your Honor, when no one in this room knew...
...what was going to happen next, in that flash of an instant...
...lies the benefit of the doubt you must give me to know that my story is true.
And that I spoke exactly as God asked me.
Mr. Landers, I cautioned you earlier that legal representation would be helpful.
I must now warn you that, in addition to the plaintiff's charges...
...I'm seriously considering citing you with contempt.
Amen.
For what you apparently thought was a very clever stunt.
You're getting deeper and deeper into trouble with this court, Mr. Landers.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
It's him.
Bobbie, it's him.
-This is most irregular.
-Your Honor, he--
I'll take it from here.
May I ask who you are, sir?
You better swear me in.
You'll never believe it.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
So help me me.
So help you you?
If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court...
...I'm God, Your Honor.
Order in the court.
Your Honor, I'd like permission to question this witness.
Sit down, Sonny,
I've answered enough questions.
He saw me, just like he said.
Each word true.
The man tried to tell a lie, his tongue would snap off.
Which I wouldn't say
I could say about everybody.
Why is it so hard for you to believe?
Is my physical existence any more improbable than your own?
What about all that hoo-hah with the devil a while ago, from that movie?
Nobody had trouble believing that the devil took over...
...and existed in the little girl.
All she had to do was wet the rug...
...throw up some pea soup, and everybody believed.
The devil you could believe, but not God?
I work in my own way.
I don't get inside little children.
They got enough to do, just being themselves.
I'm not going to go around to every person in the world and say:
"Look, it's me, I want to talk to you."
So I picked one man.
One very good man.
I told him God lives. I live.
He had trouble believing, too, in the beginning. I understood.
I'm not sure how this whole miracle business started.
The idea that anything connected with me has to be a miracle.
Personally, I'm sorry that it did.
It makes the distance between us even greater.
But if a miracle helps you believe that I am who I say I am...
...I'll give you one, a good one.
Let me see.
What's my most impressive miracle?
Pick a card.
-What?
-Pick a card, any card.
-I don't know what you think you're doing.
-A cute little miracle. Go ahead, pick one.
-There are no cards there.
-Look again.
There's nothing miraculous about good sleight of hand.
Have you ever seen this one?
Yes, I've seen them make cards appear and disappear.
As a matter of fact, I once saw a magician make an elephant disappear.
Good. Now I'll show you one that you haven't seen.
Have to get these shoes fixed.
Watch this, Your Honor.
I know how hard it is, in these times,
to have faith.
But maybe if you could have the faith
to start with...
...maybe the times would change.
You could change them, Think about it.
Try, And try not to hurt each other.
There's been enough of that.
It really gets in the way.
I'm a God of very few words,
and Jerry's already given you mine.
However hopeless, helpless,
mixed-up and scary it all gets...
...it can work.
If you find it hard to believe in me...
...maybe it would help you to know
that I believe in you.
Your Honor, I rest my case.
What?
This court is now recessed.
May I see both parties in my chambers, please?
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
So help you you?
Where's....
Order in the court.
Your Honor, I'd like permission
to question this witness.
That's all there is.
Not one word of what I assume we all assume we heard.
Someone must have erased it.
Nobody erases tapes anymore.
-Then the machine....
-No. Not a thing wrong with it.
He said he couldn't be recorded.
God, when he first spoke to me, he said it wasn't his real voice I heard.
He said he was just using one that I could understand.
He did it again today.
And there's nothing wrong with your stenotype machine?
It took down every word, Your Honor, except now...
...some of them are not on the paper.
Don't you see?
He wants us all to decide for ourselves...
...whether or not we saw him and heard him.
It's what he always said, that everything is up to us.
No! There is no proof whatsoever that God was in that courtroom today.
No, none whatsoever.
-We saw Him! We heard Him!
-We did.
-He made himself and the cards disappear.
-We saw it.
On the basis of our common experience here today...
...I can see why you first claimed, and later maintained...
...that you had seen, and been in the actual presence of...
...God.
And for that reason, your remarks to the Rev. Williams...
...could be regarded as a divine assignment.
I shall rule, therefore, that the charge of slander be dismissed.
Sam!
Now, if, as you also claim...
...it is God's opinion...
...that we should all make our own decisions...
...and abide by them accordingly...
...then I must also rule that on the basis of the evidence...
...or rather the lack of it...
...that as much as we all may think...
...that what we saw here today was real...
...God did not, in fact, appear here before us.
You may, of course, appeal to a higher court.
We heard from the highest court.
Thank you.
-Good-bye, Mister Slavic.
-And Jer, we'll send you your picture.
-Would you do that?
-Sure.
Thank you.
Hello?
-Where are you?
-Turn around.
How do you like it?
I'm going on a trip to spend a little time with animals.
I like animals, and sometimes
I don't spend enough time with them.
-We failed, didn't we?
-What are you talking? We did terrific.
I gave a message of encouragement, you passed it along, now we'll see.
You did good. We both did good.
We're covered.
You think anybody got the message?
Do you think we have enough apples in the world?
Apples?
We got all the apples we need.
You're Johnny Appleseed.
You drop a few seeds, and you move on.
If the seeds are good, they'll take root.
I gave you great seeds, the best.
I lost my job, you know.
There are other cities, other supermarkets.
Everybody thinks I'm a nut.
Galileo, Pasteur, Einstein, Columbus.
You're in good company. Hold on.
Better be going.
-Aren't you coming back?
-No.
-Ever?
-When ever comes, we'll see.
Sometimes, now and then...
...couldn't we just talk?
I'll tell you what. You talk, I'll listen.

            [girl] nice landing,
            Uncle Bene.         
                 Right on the   
                 50-yard line.  
[boy] should've gone for a touchdown.                
 Next time, I'll put it         
 right between the goalposts.   
[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.               
 [Bene] that's why we arranged  
 this little vacation.          
 We've been so busy establishing
 our community on Witch Mountain
    That you two haven't had    
    an opportunity              
 To see what life               
 in the big city is all about.  
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.          
    [chuckling] there'll be     
    another time for that.      
 Just remember what I told you, 
 and have a lot of fun.         
         - It's locked.         
         - Tia?                 
     Tony, come back here.      
Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary.      
Tia?                            
If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too.
     [tires screeching]         
     [brakes squealing]         
    You the party               
    I'm supposed to pick up?    
 - [Bene] just the children.    
 - All right.                   
    Meter's running, hop in.    
         I got it.              
        [cabbie grunts]         
     I've been                  
     waiting here forever.      
You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people.      
                 We're exactly  
                 on time.       
Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up.         
I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months.
            We have seats       
            on the 50-yard line.
         [Tony laughs]          
            Deliver the children
            to this address.    
             You'll be paid     
             after you arrive.  
This is a big fare here.        
If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip.      
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday.            
 - Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene.     
 - Goodbye.                     
     - Have fun, you two.       
     - [tires screeches]

     - [honking horn]           
             Get off the road,  
             you dummy.         
                         [sighs]
        These civilians         
        don't know how to drive.
         They ought to be       
         kept off the streets.  
 The streets belong             
 to us professional drivers.    
     Taxis, buses, trucks.      
 That's all that should         
 be allowed on the streets.     
 You see, I happen to know      
 a great deal about driving.    
I have a perfect safety record. 
                 [honking horn] 
            Come on, get out    
            of the way, you bum.
                         [sighs]
        [car doors shut]        
     [woman] thank you.         
     Thank you, sickle.         
Well, this is a perfect test site.            
Little traffic...               
...And low real estate value.              
                 It's adequate, 
                 I suppose.     
Ok, let's get this over with.   
This thing on all right?        
                     It's ready.
     What do you want him       
     to do this time?           
     I want you to              
     climb that fire escape...  
    ...To the absolute top.     
         Wait a minute.         
             Uh-uh.             
    This is as high as I go.    
     You want me to             
     break somebody's leg?      
 Just tell me how many pieces.  
 But up there, I don't go.      
- Why not?                      
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.               
I will fall.                    
     That is true, Victor.      
     He has acrophobia...       
     ...Among other things.     
 Find a different test for him. 
    Acrophobia is not           
    a problem with my device.   
        Start climbing.         
I will do anything else you say,
But I am not going up that building, understand?   
         - I...                 
         - Sickle...            
 ...I command you               
 to climb up that fire escape.  
                You will go     
                to the very top,
         You will turn around,  
         and you will look down.
     And you will not           
     be frightened of heights.  
                     Off you go.
                 It's working.  
                 It's working!  
It seems to be.                 
Victor. Victor, you are risking his life.       
He's my nephew.                 
My only living relative.        
He's the only one               
I can leave my...               
...Uh, my bankruptcy to.        
     That's what experimentation
     is all about, Letha.       
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.             
     I am the only one          
     we cannot afford to lose.  
 Can't you see that I've got    
 complete control over his mind?
             He has no fear,    
             no memory, no will.
        He can only             
        carry out my commands.  
 - [car rattling]               
 - what... What's happening?    
We're out of gas.               
What are you, crazy? Look at the dial, it points to... Empty.
             Empty?             
     - [exhales]                
     - [horns honking]          
         It was all that waiting
         I had to do for youse. 
 I'll run down the street to the
 gas station and get some gas.  
Boy, oh, boy.                   
         You guys are costing me
         a lot of dough.        
         I sure hope you        
         make the tip worth it. 
Something's going to happen to someone near here.           
             We've got to help. 
No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver.   
I'll go.                        
I think it came from back that way.                  
                     Be careful.
             And remember what  
             Uncle Bene said.   
That is enough.                 
Bring him down!                 
     [victor] sickle,           
     turn to your right.        
        Balance yourself        
                 And walk along 
                 the ledge.     
             [Letha] Victor, no.
             Stop.              
I'll bring him down myself.     
Give that to me.                
     [wires crackling]          
                    Look what   
                    you've done.
     [exhales sharply]          
         Sickle, stop.          
    Sickle, I'm                 
    commanding you to stop.     
 Sickle, this is Dr. Victor     
 Gannon commanding you to stop! 
     - He's out of control.     
     - [Letha] sickle!          
Go back!                        
 [Letha screeching] sickle!     
             No!                
                 Letha... Look. 
        - I can't look.         
        - You must.             
         [footsteps approaching]
        [Letha] it's miraculous.
There are no miracles, Letha.             
Only scientific explanations for everything.                 
Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing.              
        It... Must be...        
        ...That... Boy.         
    There's a...                
    There's a force that...     
 ...Centers around that boy.    
     A force capable            
     of countermanding          
 The basic physical law of...   
 Gravity.                       
 Victor, I don't know           
 what you're talking about.     
    Molecular mobilization.     
 - I need that boy, Letha.      
 - [horns honking]              
 - I need him desperately.      
 - Now, just a minute.          
             Brilliant, my boy. 
             Brilliant.         
Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic...              
Well, whatever it was you just did,                   
It was absolutely heroic.       
        It was nothing,         
        I just... [gasps]       
     [tires screeching]         
            [sirens approaching]
[dog barks]                     
[helicopter approaching]        
[boy #1] get off the street!                     
        - [boy #2] run!         
        - [boy #3] hide!        
        [boy #4] here come      
        the goon goons!         
         [older boy #1]         
         let's get 'em!         
    [older boy #2]              
    they run like chickens.     
[boy #1] more goons!            
         [boy #2] we're trapped!
[boy #3] hide or they'll get ya.
         Over here.             
[older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans. 
[older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang.        
             Let's finish 'em.  
     [older boy #1] hey!        
[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?
        It was a set up.        
    - Let's give it to 'em.     
    - Yeah.                     
         - [all yell]           
         - hey!                 
         [laughing]             
     That was an ambush!        
     [older boy #2]             
     stop banging into me.      
 [older boy #1] I can't see.    
[older boy #3]                  
I can't get out.                
 [older boy #4] get me out.     
 Get it off me.                 
    [boys] yeah! All right!     
Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out.         
             Yeah, thanks a lot.
     - What's your name?        
     - Tia.                     
         - I'm Rocky.           
         - I'm muscles.         
     - Crusher.                 
     - And I'm dazzler.         
 We're the earthquake gang.     
            Does that scare you?
             - No.              
             - Aww.             
Let's change our name again.                 
We gotta have a name that scares.             
            - Yeah.             
            - Hey.              
 How'd you do what you done?    
     Well, I really             
     didn't do anything.        
     Yeah. You a magician       
     or something?              
             No.                
 You want to join our gang?     
    I'm sorry.                  
    I'm looking for someone.    
        - Thanks anyway.        
        - Aw, sure.             
     I guess you're like        
     the rest of them.          
     You've heard               
     we're a nothing gang.      
    Yeah, well we ain't         
    always gonna be nothing.    
     Someday we're gonna        
     be the toughest.           
 Take over the whole territory. 
    Someday they're gonna run   
    when they see us            
    coming down the block.      
         All right.             
    It's just that              
    I've got to find my brother.
 What gang does he belong to?   
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]                
 I never heard of a Guy         
 that never belonged to a gang. 
 I'm sure something's happened. 
 I've got to find him.          
    If anybody could find him,  
    we could.                   
     I mean, we know            
     this town inside out.      
         Oh, would you?         
        Hey, yeah, sure.        
Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you.        
     Thank you.                 
     Thank you very much.       
    Hey, come on, let's go.     
            That Tony sure      
            made himself scarce.
 - We better walk you home.     
 - Where do you live?           
I... I was supposed to stay at a hotel.                
But I don't know which one.                      
        You could stay          
        in our hideout.         
         - [boys] yeah!         
         - Thank you.           
     We'll look                 
     for Tony tomorrow.         
     If we aren't busy          
     beating up goons.          
     - Yeah.                    
     - Hey, it's yo-yo.         
        - Get down.             
        - Come on, hide.        
        - Did he see us?        
        - I don't know.         
 - But he's coming this way.    
 - [Tia] who is he?             
 - [muscles] our worst enemy.   
 - He's worse than the goons.   
 [Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto,     
 the truant officer.            
         He's trying to make us 
         go back to school.     
     [dazzler] let's go.        
         [all] yeah!            
             That's our hideout.
     [stairs creaking]          
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?            
        [Rocky] don't say things
        like that.              
        This place could        
        really scare ya.        
            [gasps]             
Come on.                        
 This is where we're gonna live 
 when we run away from home.    
        Yeah, you can't be tough
     If you take orders from    
     your mom or older sister.  
        That's why              
        we quit school.         
     You can't be tough         
     and educated, too.         
[crusher] yeah.                 
        - Tony!                 
        - [boys] where?         
 I had a contact with him.      
You...                          
You calling on the spirits?     
             Shh.               
        - She's weird.          
        - She's creepy.         
    I... I ain't too sure       
    I wanna meet this Tony.     
             Shh!               
     Tony, where are you?       
     He's coming in again.      
    I can only see a light.     
    That's all.                 
    Now it's... Going black.    
 Now it's... Completely gone.   
     [machines beeping]         
                He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes            
As he struggles to regain consciousness.        
His output is so great,         
That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it.   
             But he's dangerous.
Once I have control of his brain, Letha,            
He will only be dangerous to others.         
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
My experiments are more important than the law, Letha.  
With these receptors placed on certain people,       
Combined with this boy's powers,              
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.   
         Oh, you are absolutely 
         brilliant, professor.  
             Now we can go ahead
             with my plans, too.
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant.     
 A comment, perhaps, on you and 
 the life you've been leading.  
             Now, you look here,
    Doctor, professor,          
    physicist. Whatever you are.
     I built this laboratory    
     for you at great expense.  
     I used every penny I had.  
 Now, we've made a lot of plans 
 and I won't let you upset them.
        I want some money. Fast.
Letha, we are worlds apart.                   
My mind is filled with large concepts.            
Mankind, the universe.          
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.      
            Sure, I gamble...   
     ...But with my own money.  
                You're the worst
                kind of gambler.
            You use             
            other people's money
     And want to keep all       
     the winnings for yourself. 
         Well, you can be sure  
         of one thing, Victor.  
     I'll be around to pick up  
     the chips with you.        
    - [wires pop and sizzle]    
    - [Tony moans]              
         [panting]              
         [grunting]             
    We'll be back in the morning
    with maps and breakfast.    
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.           
             And I'll bring some
             day-old bread.     
- I'll bring some milk for you. 
- Thank you.                    
 - You're good friends.         
 - That's the trouble with us.  
 We don't want to be good.      
 We want to be bad.             
             Yeah.              
 Hey, uh, let's go, you guys.   
 My mom's gonna yell at me.     
[crusher] see you tomorrow,     
Tia.                            
 [muscles] we'll find Tony      
 tomorrow for sure.             
 [Rocky] let's stay close       
 together on the way out, guys. 
            [sighs]             
                         Good.  
             This is            
             professor Gannon...
             ...Commanding you  
             to awaken.         
[indistinct shouting]           
                         Tony!  
 He's in some kind of a room.   
                Like a hospital.
     With machines              
     and instruments and things.
Oh, that's easy.                
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.     
     While we going around      
     looking for a fight.       
            Come on.            
 [victor] you will now function 
 exclusively under control.     
            You will no longer  
            think independently.
     All thinking and reasoning 
     will be done               
             By the voice       
             that commands you. 
             Do you understand? 
     - Yes.                     
     - What is your name?       
     - Tony.                    
     - Where are you from?      
Witch mountain.                 
        Sounds like             
        some hick town to me.   
         How did you suspend    
         Mr. Sickle in mid-air? 
     By energizing matter.      
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow? 
         Yes, sir.              
- How did you learn to do this? 
- I was born with the ability.  
 I wish to see a demonstration  
 of molecular flow.             
                You are strapped
                to the table.   
             Unbuckle yourself  
             and sit up.        
         Power has come         
         into our hands         
     Which is centuries         
     before its time.           
We must use it wisely.          
                Well, what can  
                you have him do?
     Other than go around making
     people's belts unbuckle.   
The possibilities are unlimited.
     Oh, come on. It's just     
     some gimmick, that's all.  
Tony...                         
         Mr. Sickle,            
         whose life you saved,  
             Doesn't seem       
             to believe in you. 
         Mr. Sickle             
         needs convincing, Tony.
[knob squeaks]                  
         [gas hissing]          
         Hey, come on.          
Hey, get back!                  
     Get back! Get back!        
Don't.                          
[grunting] get back!                       
[goat bleats]                   
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention. 
But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?   
[goat bleats]                   
     I will demonstrate         
     an industrial application. 
Come with me, Tony.             
         [gas continues to hiss]
             Now, Tony,         
             those wine casks...
         Stack them... Neatly.  
            Two glasses         
            of burgundy, please.
                 To molecular   
                 mobilization.  
 To molecular capitalization.   
        - [goat bleats]         
        - [gas hisses]          
[muscles] hey, got any more clues?             
             No.                
        Nothing at all.         
        It's so strange.        
 We've been to every hospital   
 and he's in none of them.      
             It's like          
             his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.           
 - Don't listen to him.         
 - We'll find Tony for sure.    
     Yeah, we'll turn           
     the town upside down.      
Yeah.                           
 - [sickle] what're you doing?  
 - [Letha] thinking.            
Thinking about us in a different place, such as...   
Las Vegas...                    
...With Tony.                   
             Seven or eleven    
             every time, right? 
A day at the races.             
             All the long shots  
             come in.           
[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all.      
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.        
For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them.  
If he can stack them, he can unstack them.            
         The gold is on display 
         at the museum.         
    Protected by an impenetrable
    security system.            
             Just sitting there 
             waiting for us...  
             ...To penetrate it.
Wait a minute. Us?              
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?     
 Professor Gannon is            
 extremely busy being a genius. 
 I own half the invention,      
 Half of Tony, that means       
 I own half of the profits.     
     So far, the return on      
     my investment has been     
     half of zero.              
What about security. We'd need an army to pull it off.    
     We'll have an army with us!
             Tony.              
         [chuckles]             
              Tony?             
              Tony?             
      Tony, why can't I         
      get through to you?       
              Tony?             
I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops.  
Be back later on.               
            [Letha] don't worry.
                 Everything's   
                 under control. 
            Tony.               
            This is Letha wedge,
             Commanding you     
             to open your eyes. 
                 Now, stand up. 
     We're going to the museum  
     for education and profit.  
        [brakes squeak]         
        Tony and I will do      
        a little... Sightseeing.
     [indistinct chatter]       
                     [Tia] wait.
     Gold! I see gold.          
        - Hey it's mine.        
        - Where is it?          
     - Hey, give it to me!      
     - No!                      
         A stagecoach.          
     She must be tuned in       
     on a western.              
                         Yeah.  
         I see dummies.         
     [both] that's you.         
        No. Old things.         
                     Clothing.  
             Hey, he's at       
             the salvation army.
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army.          
            They don't got gold,
            neither.            
                Wait a minute,  
                wait a minute!  
         We had one of them     
         nothing school trips.  
                 To the museum. 
                 Yeah, they got 
                 a pile of gold.
And a stagecoach.               
They had to kick me out.        
     We've got to go there.     
                 Come on,       
                 it's over here.
        [kids grunting]         
     [indistinct chatter]       
        [tires screech]         
Now, Tony.                      
We're going to create a little diversion.             
The stagecoach.                 
I want you to roll it all around the museum.          
[woman gasps]                   
[woman] look out.               
                 [man] watch it.
[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way.           
Hey, where are the horses?                     
                I... Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.          
                [man] watch out.
            [yelps]             
Short circuit the control system.             
    [control system buzzes]     
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [guard screams]         
            Oh, no.             
             Letha!             
             Letha!             
     [indistinct shouting]      
[chortling]                     
         - [gasps]              
         - look out.            
        [man] get out of my way.
         [moaning]              
         [guards yell]          
[man] can't you put that thing out?                 
Come on, take a shot.           
Move it.                        
Now, Tony,                      
Make a hole in the plastic shield.          
And it doesn't have to be neat. 
Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 
 [man] move it buddy, move it.  
 We gotta get out of here!      
Las Vegas, here we come.                   
             Oh!                
     - Look.                    
     - [bars thudding]          
                     Come on,   
                     follow me. 
Tony, make them go faster.                      
     [woman] watch out!         
    Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha!     
     - [woman screams]          
     - [man] hey!               
     [indistinct chatter]       
        Look out, lady.         
Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy.    
            [gasps]             
     [man] look out, Eddie!     
[Letha] Tony, what's happening? 
[Tony] molecular flow reversing.
     - Are you doing this?      
     - No.                      
Then who is?                    
             It would have to be
             one of my people.  
 - There are more like you?     
 - Yes.                         
 - Oh! Let's get out of here.   
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
             Tony!              
Who's that?                     
                 It's my sister.
                 My sister, Tia.
This is no time for a family reunion.           
     [crowd murmuring]          
[victor] Letha!                 
             Tony!              
         [victor] you fool!     
         How could you do this? 
        [Letha] not now.        
     - [door shuts]             
     - [engine sticking]        
        - What's wrong?         
        - I don't know.         
 I keep it running perfect.     
It's Tony's sister, she did it. 
She's as weird as he is.        
     Tony, I command you to     
     make this car run perfectly
 And continuously without       
 interference from your sister. 
        [engine starts]         
     I can't stop the car.      
     Tony's energizing it.      
         It's like your brother 
         doesn't even know you. 
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo. Let's go! 
- No. Don't run.                
     You crazy? You don't want  
     to go to that school.      
     Please, trust me.          
     Now, come on, hurry.       
 [Rocky] hey, wait for me.      
 [dazzler] come on, you guys.   
 Get in there.                  
     - Let's go!                
     - Come on, get in.         
        - [door shuts]          
        - I'm dreaming.         
 You're surrendering            
 to the board of education?     
Sir, you see that car going down the street?          
     - Yeah.                    
     - My brother's in it.      
He ought to be going to school. 
You ought to catch up with him. 
    Another truant? Oh, boy,    
    we're gonna have a load.    
     - Hey, what happened?      
     - Good driving, yo-yo.     
Yeah, that was neat.            
             [laughs] this bus  
             can really move.   
             Tony, look         
             through the window.
                The rear window.
                That minibus    
                is following us.
         I command you to place 
         obstacles in its path. 
         [tires squeal]         
     City property.             
     I've damaged city property.
                     [moaning]  
[panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof.
 Was that a bus or a bridge?    
         They're still with us. 
        Tony, you must stop her.
Man, that man was really buzzing.                 
     Am I still alive?          
        [tires screech]         
         They're gaining on us. 
     She counteracts            
     everything that Tony does. 
                Tony, you've    
                got to stop her.
                        We flew!
        [boys cheering]         
             They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.                    
     Sickle... Sickle, stop...  
     Stop over that hill.       
 Tony, cause the reflection     
 of the sun on the rear window  
             To magnify and     
             shine so brightly  
            That our pursuers'll
            be blinded by it.   
        [glass breaking]        
             [van scrapes road] 
[muscles] come on, open the doors.                 
     [crusher] I can't see.     
- [Tia] yeah.                   
- [muscles] come on, let me out.
    - Everybody ok?             
    - [all kids] yeah, sure.    
        Oh, look what's happened
        to city property.       
No... But I'm still gonna take you to school.       
     - Just soon as I...        
     - Come on.                 
     [siren approaching]        
You jeopardized my life's work. 
My accountants' are desperate.                  
         You've proved yourself 
         incompetent yet again. 
        I don't even know if    
        I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?             
I trusted you enough            
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.         
Don't tell me you don't trust me.             
We have to trust each other.               
     Right.                     
     I trust everybody.         
             Yes...             
             Well, fortunately, 
         I thought of something 
         very spectacular       
 Which will satisfy both of us  
 in terms of prestige and money.
Well, you have the prestige,    
I'll take the money.            
But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,          
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.            
     How did she know           
     we were at the museum?     
                I...            
                I'm not certain.
Tony.                           
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?     
         Telepathy.             
            She'll show up again
            and ruin everything.
In that case, she will have to be, as you would say... 
...Scratched?                   
     [Tony whispering] Tia.     
          [louder] Tia.         
              Tia!              
  [Tia] what happened to you?   
  [Tony] I can't explain now.   
     I've lost                  
     the power to energize.     
      [Tia] where are you?      
  [Tony] follow my voice path.  
  Please!                       
      [Tia] ok. Guide me.       
         [dog barks]            
      Tony, which way?          
              [Tony] this way.  
        [sirens blaring]        
      Which way, Tony?          
      Which way?                
 [Tony] keep moving             
 straight ahead.                
      This is the house.        
          Here, look.           
          Come on.              
        - [door closes]         
        - down here.            
                 [goat bleats]  
     Be quiet, Alfred,          
     you silly thing.           
          [Tony] Tia!           
             Tony!              
            [yells]             
         [gas hissing]          
     I've put her into a state  
     of comatose neutralization.
 [crusher] hey, Tia.            
 We got you some cold hotcakes. 
        She ain't here.         
 Hope she didn't go             
 looking for Tony without us.   
             Yeah, she needs us.
      [Tia] Tony? Crusher?      
         Muscles? Rocky?        
      - Dazzler?                
      - [Alfred bleats]         
             Alfred.            
  Alfred,                       
  what's the matter with me?    
          Where am I?           
  Alfred, find the earthquakes. 
         [bleating]             
         Listen to me.          
         [bleating]             
    [hoof steps approaching]     
         [bleating]             
     [sickle] what kind         
     of place is that?          
 [victor] that is an underground
 plutonium processing plant.    
         Translate that         
         into financial terms.  
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.        
             That's why         
             I like scientists. 
     They're always discovering 
     new, expensive things.     
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.    
             I suppose you're   
             going to have Tony 
             Split an atom bomb 
             or something.      
In effect...                    
...Yes                          
         Well, I didn't count on
         killing anybody.       
             Especially not us. 
It will never go that far.      
They will pay anything to prevent it.         
This is the first step towards my becoming             
The most powerful man in the world.                   
         Ids, please.           
         Take a powder.         
                     [laughing] 
Tony.                           
Those are the outer security scanners.        
 Put them out of commission...  
        ...Permanently.         
            [static]            
            The scanning systems
            are malfunctioning. 
            All right, let's run
            a maintenance check.
Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right.  
    - Where to?                 
    - Andy's place, know it?    
Yeah, sure. I know where everything is. Second and third?
 - [man] fourth and market.     
 - That one.                    
 - Hop in.                      
 - I'm in a hurry. Could you... 
            [grunts]            
        - Don't worry.          
        - [tires screech]       
    Have you there              
    in a couple of minutes.     
[Alfred bleats]                 
            Listen.             
 Feel the power in this cab?    
    - [Alfred bleats]           
    - it has lots of power.     
 You know, everybody tells me,  
 I ought to be a race driver.   
     - What do you think?       
     - [bleats]                 
 Well, I think you're wrong.    
Don't worry about nothing, sir. 
I'm a very safe driver.         
- Want me to tell you how safe? 
- [Alfred bleating]             
     I'll tell you anyway.      
 I've been driving a hack       
 for 19 years and 11 months.    
 And in all that time, I never  
 even put one scratch on a cab. 
     In fact, next month,       
     They're gonna give me      
     a gold safety award.       
 - What do you think of that?   
 - [bleating]                   
 Boy, you don't like nothing.   
     - I sure hope              
     you're a good tipper.      
     - [bleats]                 
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.     
     [tires screeching]         
[cabbie] hey!                   
             Hey!               
     You owe me a fare!         
                 [cabbie sighs] 
 - Officer, that goat's a guy.  
 - The goat?                    
         The guy became a goat  
         when I'm driving.      
The guy?                        
     This magician              
     beat me out of this fare.  
The magician?                   
    - My perfect record.        
    - Record? Oh... Record.     
         I ain't gonna get      
         the gold safety award. 
 - [hoof steps approaching]      
 - hear that? That must be her. 
         - [bleats]             
         - come on.             
 [boys grunting and panting]    
     [dazzler] help me.         
[grunts] hey. Watch out.        
        - [bleating]            
        - get him away.         
    - [moans]                   
    - how'd you get in here?    
        Hey, come on,           
        get out of here.        
[Rocky] watch out!              
             He's looking at me 
             like he knows me.  
 Hey, what do you want from me? 
                     Get away!  
     He's got Tia's vest.       
            Get him!            
             Quick.             
  - [phone ringing]             
  - we're going for coffee now. 
    - [phone ringing]           
    - can I bring you a cup?    
     May I see your ids, please?
Tony?                           
Show him our id.                
     What's happening?          
Why?                            
    Don't leave me up here.     
                Open the door,  
                Tony.           
     You can't go in there      
     without ids.               
     - Now seal it.             
     - How do I get down?       
         [boys panting]         
             Tia!               
 - Quick, let's get her out.    
 - Yeah.                        
     - Phew, it smells.         
     - [boys cough]             
It's some kind of a gas.                       
Come on.                        
        [inhales deeply]        
         You ok now?            
        Yes, thank you.         
    This is some kind of...     
     ...Science place.          
     - How'd you get here?      
     - It was Tony.             
                    He was here.
        I saw something!        
         What was it?           
        It's where Tony is.     
        I'm sure of it!         
     A big, round shape.        
A doughnut!                     
He's eating a doughnut.         
No way!                         
     Is it like a ball?         
     A great big ball?          
     - Yes.                     
     - I know where he is.      
         Let's go!              
        Hurry, let's go.        
                 [Alfred bleats]
     Oh, thank you.             
     And thanks for everything. 
     Come on, let's go.         
We are about to make scientific history.     
         [Letha] and some money,
         too, I hope.           
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.  
[alarm ringing]                 
It's a red light on the cooling system.          
     It must be                 
     a circuit breaker.         
     Restart the system.        
I can't get a restart.          
         Hit the backup system. 
It's no-go on backup.           
Temperature increasing in the furnace.                 
 - Get that coolant flowing.    
 - [phone buzzes]               
     - Furnace control.         
     - Control?                 
 You don't really think you're  
 controlling anything, do you?  
 - [alarm continues buzzing]    
 - who is this?                 
      [victor] this is          
      Dr. Victor Gannon,        
  And I have just shut down     
  your cooling system.          
        Ok, you've shut it down.
        Get it back on again!   
        Tell him how expensive  
        it is to put it back on.
In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium,      
Medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met.   
        What conditions?        
Five million dollars in cash.                        
A jet waiting at the airport.   
A safe escort, of course.       
And most important of all,      
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon          
Has achieved molecular control and mind control.               
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.    
        [line cuts out]         
 How long does it take          
 to count five million dollars? 
        [alarm ringing]         
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [siren wailing]         
     [indistinct shouting]      
     [machines beeping]         
We'll have to pay them.         
 Evacuate the immediate area.   
 Put Los Angeles on alert.      
         [horn honking]         
There's the big round ball.                 
 - Is that it?                  
 - No, it was bigger than that. 
        Get outta here.         
            Leave me alone.     
            At least I tried.   
                     Hey, look. 
It's yo-yo.                     
Let's get out of here.          
            Come on.            
             [radio plays music]
 Hey, yo-yo.                    
 Don't you want to catch us?    
I don't trust him.              
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.    
            Come on.            
[dazzler] hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?     
        It's not my job anymore.
             They're coming down
             to fire me...      
             ...For destroying  
             city property.     
The only thing that works is the radio. And it won't turn off.   
     I was only trying          
     to help you kids.          
         Mr. Yokomoto,          
 I'm sorry about                
 everything that's happened.    
 All I ever wanted in life      
Was all you kids that           
I put back in school, someday...
     ...Visit me and say,       
 "thanks Mr. Yo-yo, Yokomoto.   
 If it wasn't for you           
 forcing us to get an education,
    We would've been bums."     
     That's all I wanted.       
You see?                        
I told you he was gonna...      
 ...Hit us with                 
 some of that heavy psychology. 
     I mean, I feel guilty.     
     [man on radio] bulletin    
     from the plutonium plant.  
  Unless the demands            
  of the terrorists are met,    
 The furnace will explode       
 with the force of ten megatons.
  An official describes         
  the atomic furnace controls   
  as frozen in position,        
 - As if "the molecular flow..."
 - that's Tony!                 
- The plant is being evacuated. 
- That's where he is!           
    - We've got to go there.    
    - How? Take a bus?          
 - We'll go in this.            
 - Tia, the tires are flat.     
            Come on.            
        [tires screech]         
     [machine beeping]          
If it doesn't start cooling soon,             
The chain reaction will start.                     
                 You hear that? 
                 In ten minutes,
     This place is going to be  
     a hole in the ground.      
     Now, let's be reasonable.  
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.    
 And the balance is on the way. 
                    It's a deal.
I do not compromise.            
     [alarm continues]          
- Hey, what are you guys doing? 
- [man] nothing! Nothing!       
     We're doing nothing.       
         - Hey, kids!           
         - [man grunts]         
How did these children get past security?              
 Sir, the people destroying the 
 furnace kidnapped my brother.  
             If I could see him,
             I might stop them. 
    - [boys] she can do it!     
    - She can do it.            
        - [alarm beeps]         
        - do what?              
Impossible, they're inside the room.        
They've sealed the door somehow.               
- What part has to be fixed?    
- The emergency cooling system. 
     - Where is it?             
     - Five levels down.        
But it's too late. We've already begun to evacuate the plant.    
Tony's here, all right.                      
         Get me down.           
 Thank you, thank you.          
 Now, where are you going?      
                     In there.  
Oh, no. You can't go beyond this point without ids.  
 - [footsteps approaching]      
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
         - Tia!                 
         - I knew it.           
 She'll spoil everything.       
 I can just taste that money.   
     We cannot let her          
     take it away from us.      
                         Tony!  
 Tony, from this moment         
 you will no longer hear Tia.   
    She cannot break through    
    my power of control.        
 - Acknowledge.                 
 - [Tia] Tony, what's wrong?    
          It's me, your sister. 
             Try to remember me.
         Acknowledge.           
              Tony?             
     - Yes, sir.                
     - Get those kids.          
        She'll use some of those
        molecules on us.        
I'll take care of her before she gets a Chance, you get them.
 [Tia] I can't get through.     
     I don't know what          
     they've done to his mind.  
 We've got to find the emergency
 cooling system ourselves.      
 How do you spell cooling?      
                        Come on.
     - [Tia] uh-oh.             
     - [muscles] whoa.          
             [Rocky] look out.  
     [rapid footsteps approach] 
    We've got to find           
    the emergency switches.     
    You two go that way,        
    and you two go that way.    
                 Tony, we must  
                 eliminate Tia. 
[footsteps approach]            
 You will cause that portable   
 utility panel to run her down. 
     - Hey, Tia, come here.     
     - [machines whirring]      
            Come on.            
     That ain't it, right?      
     - [Tia] you found it!      
     - I knew it was it!        
     But, it's spelt wrong.     
            You guys get        
            dazzler and muscles.
         Ok. Come on.           
                 [door opening] 
         The rest of the money's
         just arrived.          
         All right.             
    I'd better call Gannon.     
The cooling system's on.        
         Switch it off.         
     [man] we lost it!          
 What's going on down there?    
             It's coming back.  
            Gotcha!             
    Tony, you must stop her.    
             Tony, why are you  
             doing these things?
    Why are you using           
    your powers against me?     
                What's happened?
                         Tony...
                ...Pretend      
                to remember Tia.
     Lure her to the            
     center of the room and...  
             ...Make that crane 
             drop on her.       
             Tia!               
 I'm starting to remember.      
                What was the    
                matter with you?
I don't know, exactly... But... 
         I need help.           
     Don't go any closer.       
     Why? What is it, Tony?     
         Tony, stop it!         
         Stop it, Tony, stop it!
Exert a force greater than hers.              
 Why are you doing this, Tony?  
 Stop.                          
                    Crush her.  
                    Kill her!   
                     Crush her! 
         Crush her! Crush her!  
                     Finish her!
     - Now!                     
     - [Tony groaning]          
Tia.                            
Where are we?                   
What's happened?                
        [victor screams]        
         - Ha!                  
         - [boys yell]          
                 [victor] Tony. 
     Tony, we can still do it.  
         We can still make use  
         of molecular control.  
Ok, doc, let's do it.                    
         [moaning]              
         [grunting]             
            [footsteps approach]
         [boys pant]            
        [victor] Letha!         
    Why don't we                
    all go and have some...     
     Some candy and, uh,        
     sodas and ice cream?       
[Letha moans]                   
                    Next time...
     - ...Next time I'll...     
     - Forget it.               
I've lost my faith in science.  
     - [sickle grunts]          
     - huh?                     
         [boys moan]            
        [victor] sickle!        
[moaning]                       
        Aunt Letha!             
        Oh, aunt Letha.         
             Help.              
     [gasping] aunt Letha?      
     Aunt Letha?                
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.            
     - Come on.                 
     - [engine shuts off]       
         Tony, the bus won't run
         without me in it.      
             It's all my fault. 
             It's such a mess.  
Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it.            
             I'm sure Uncle Bene
             won't mind.        
         I'll do the engine.    
         You do the body work.  
     - Ok.                      
     - So long, Alfie.          
     - Goodbye, Alfred.         
     - [blows kiss]             
[bleats]                        
     What job will you do now,  
     Mr. Yo-yo, uh, Yokomoto?   
    Oh, I've saved my money.    
    I'll probably open          
    a Japanese delicatessen.    
     - [metal scraping]         
     - hey, kids, look.         
    I don't understand this.    
     - Man!                     
     - Wow, what a family.      
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...        
 - ...Somehow.                  
 - Uh, that's a possibility.    
     You know what this means?  
     They never saw the wreck.  
 I'll tell them that the reports
 were exaggerated.              
         And, if you kids       
         will go back to school,
                 I'm sure they  
                 won't fire me. 
You will go back to school, won't you?                      
         Well, if we was        
         to go back to school,  
         Could we get as smart  
         as Tia and Tony?       
     - Maybe even smarter.      
     - Yeah, sure.              
Let's give it a shot.           
             Great.             
 I hope the school can take it. 
     - Goodbye, yo-yo.          
     - Goodbye.                 
- [Rocky] see you later, yo-yo. 
- You promised.                 
     Tia, open the gate.        
 No, everybody join hands.      
            - Whoa.             
            - Wow.              
         [boys] cool!           
[muscles] all right!            
Wow! Flying saucer!             
Will we ever see you again?                  
                 Well, it's...  
                    It's kind of
                    hard to say.
Thanks for everything.          
     And especially for         
     letting me be in your gang.
Take care of Alfred for me, ok?                     
         [all laugh]            
There you are.                  
    - Where's your luggage?     
    - Uh, we lost it.           
                 There were     
                 a few problems.
    - But you did have fun?     
    - Oh, terrible.             
I just knew we should have gone surfing.       
     [mechanical whirring]      
         [all] wow.             
Hey. Let's do it the way        
Tia and Tony taught us.         
         [all] yeah.            
    - Ready?                    
    - [all] one, two, three!    
         [all grunt]            
         - Hey, yo-yo!          
         - Yo-yo!               
         [panting] guess what!  
     Tia and Tony just drove off
     in a flying saucer.        
        - Flying saucer?        
        - Whoosh!               
Whoosh?                         
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?          
                 But, it's true.
    Lookit, I saw those two kids
    do miraculous things.       
I believe anything and everything, except that. Get in.
     I hope this school teaches 
     about flying saucers.      
Yeah.                           
                Flying saucers. 
                [laughs]        
[engine starts]                 
     [mechanical whirring]

-My stomach thinks my throat's cut.
-Yeah, well, let's pack it in.
Sorry.
Well, my roof's still letting wet in.
As soon as we've done this stockade,
I'll do your roof, all right?
I can feel my rheumatics coming on.
Is all this more important than my health?
Yes.
Well, I shan't be much use to you laid up, will I?
You're not too much use anyway.
-Now look...
-Look, it's entirely up to you.
You can either help us build this stockade to keep the sheep in, or you can sit up at night and beat the dogs off.
Not much in it with the way my roof leaks if you ask me.
Well, I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.
You could have got all this done instead of gallivanting off to London.
Don't push your luck, cock.
That trip to London was no picnic.
Where do you suppose that wire came from anyway?
-What are you doing?
-Reducing fat.
-Yeah, well, that's not your job.
-No, but we're getting short.
-Let Hubert do the damn thing.
-It's not enough.
-Ruth wants to make more soap.
-Ruth can go and...
She's done nothing but talk about soap since you got back from London.
Will you see it doesn't...
All right, all right. I'm coming.
-Three?
-Go on. I made one extra.
What have we done to deserve this?
Jenny's got enough on her plate already.
-Well, thanks, Pet.
-Where's Charles?
We must have charcoal.
Hello, Greg. How's Jenny?
Well, since you're asking,
I think she's doing too much.
You're blaming me?
We've gone long enough without soap, we can go without it for a while longer.
No, sorry.
We keep clean, we keep healthy.
It's as simple as that.
-Yeah, with one notable exception.
-What does that mean?
Hubert. I mean, those stinking clothes are stuck to him.
It's not funny.
Oh, come on, Greg, you're overprotective about Jenny.
I don't see why she should work like a slave while Hubert does sweet FA.
That applies to all of us, not just Jenny.
Well, of course it does!
So what are we going to do about it?
LIZZIE: I'll get you!
JOHN: No, you won't.
LIZZIE: Come back.
You'll never catch me.
-I will.
-You won't!
-Yes, I will.
-Oh, no, you won't.
What's the matter?
We can't go near strangers.
You might not be well.
(LAUGHING) Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
It's all right, they've not been in contact with me.
I'm Alistair McFadden.
Have you been ill?
-What?
-The disease.
Oh, yes. Yes, a long time ago.
Must be over a year now.
-By the way, what month is it?
-Well, it's March.
-Where have you come from?
-Nowhere.
I mean, I've been on the move since
I left the bunker about a week ago.
-Bunker?
-Nuclear testing bunker.
At least that's what I think it was.
They're all over the country if you can find them.
Well, I'm afraid if you want to join us, you'll have to go into quarantine for 10 days.
-Ten days?
-Yeah, well, I'll take you down.
Well, there it is.
The house that Jack built.
There's a stove in there. It's a lot more comfortable than it looks.
Three of us were in there only a fortnight ago.
Well, that's marvellous.
-You built it?
-With my own fair hands.
Not just for people like me, surely?
No. We had this guy who had to go into Birmingham and he caught the plague or something bad.
Well, he was quite a fella.
So I built this as a sort of practical memorial to him.
We got to be careful.
You seem a very friendly and sensible people.
JACK: Well, we haven't taken to cannibalism yet.
No.
Anyway, you can incarcerate yourself now.
Well, see you all in 10 days, then.
Don't worry, we'll feed you.
Of course, we might come and stare at you as there's no zoos left.
Well, it's all very peaceful.
-JACK: Hubert!
-Yeah, yeah.
Well, shut the door.
-Now, Hubert...
-Look, I've got one loaf. Look.
-Greg got three today.
-For the four of them.
Look, soon as we finish that fence,
I'm going to fix your roof for you, all right?
Out there in all weathers.
I need more bread than him or anyone.
You're in one of your pigheads today, ain't you?
-It's damp in here.
-Well, you wanted to live here.
-You said you felt shut in.
-I did not! I was put in here!
From now on,
I do as much as anybody else.
Which isn't much.
Well, it may be a big room, but I'm not having Hubert in with me.
-Come on, Arthur, give him a chance.
-He smells.
He's a malcontent, he's got appalling manners, he's idle and he annoys me.
He's outside in all this weather.
Well, it's mainly that he smells.
I tried to talk to him about it, but he wouldn't listen.
It's no excuse for him.
Those of us who've achieved a certain standard of hygiene are not going to put up with less.
You can tell him that.
Keeping warm?
Yes, thanks.
-What are you reading?
-Poetry. Wordsworth.
Oh!
-"A host of golden daffodils."
-A little more than that.
He was a great philosopher.
Like Rousseau.
-Nature poetry?
-Yes.
Well, he really believed that nature was a force that ran through everything.
Man, beasts, plants...
I'm sorry. I'm being pompous.
Oh, no, no, not at all.
No, read me some.
-Really?
-Yes, go on.
"Once again I see these hedgerows, hardly hedgerows,
"little lines of sportive wood run wild.
"These pastoral farms green to the very door.
"And wreaths of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees
"with some uncertain notice, as might seem of vagrant dwellers
"in the houseless woods,
"or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire,
"the hermit sits alone."
Go on.
"These beauteous forms, through a long absence,
"have seemed to me as is a landscape to a blind man's eye.
"But oft, in lonely rooms amid the din of towns and cities,
"I have owed to them in hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
"felt in the blood and felt along the heart,
"and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration."
Oh, shut up!
Jenny said I've got to tell you your meal's ready this time.
If you don't hurry, it'll get cold!
-Women.
-Can't live without them, Jack.
Some of us have to.
Just in time.
-How's Alistair getting on?
-Oh, he seems fine.
(LAUGHS) He's reading poetry.
It's a bit cold in that tree house for him though, isn't it?
No, he seems warm enough.
He's got a sleeping bag and a stove.
Ow!
You know, you'd think he'd suffer more from loneliness.
Says he hasn't spoken to a living soul till he came here.
Well, what's he in quarantine for?
-Ten days. We made it a rule.
-I know.
But for people who have been in contact with other people.
Well, I better see him.
I mean, there's no point in being stuck out there just for a rule.
Lizzie!
Lizzie!
-Have you seen Lizzie?
-No. I thought she was with you.
-Ruth's letting the man out.
-What man?
-Oh, the new man. Letting him out?
-Yes.
-But he's only been here one night.
-I know, but that's what I said.
But Ruth said I was to mind my own business.
Oh, did she? Well, I'm going down there.
Now listen, will you stay here and keep an eye on Paul?
And don't make a noise and wake him up.
-But what about Lizzie?
-Oh, never mind about Lizzie.
She's probably with George and the others.
McFadden. M-C-F-A-D-D-E-N.
-How old are you, Alistair?
-What was your previous job?
-Librarian.
-Any practical skills?
-Not really.
Who told you about us?
I thought you said you'd not been in contact with anyone.
Well, I hadn't. We spoke over a hedge.
He was on horseback.
-When was this?
-About a week, 10 days ago.
-Where?
-I'm not sure exactly.
About 100 miles away.
The time it took for me to get here.
He said he was looking for his wife and child.
Wife and child?
Well, I assumed he was talking about his wife.
-Did he mention any names?
-No.
Yes, yes, he said the boy's name was Peter.
Which way did he go?
I'm not sure.
I'd say he was making for the coast.
Said something about a house being burnt down.
Jimmy Garland!
-He saw the message Charles left.
-Well, why hasn't he come along here?
He must have got another lead on Abby.
-ALISTAIR: These are people you know?
-Yes.
Oh, Jenny. You haven't met
Alistair McFadden, have you?
Well, we've waved at each other. Hello.
-How do you do?
-It's all right, he's well enough.
Alistair was directed here by Jimmy Garland.
Jimmy? Well, where is he?
He's not sure, but they met 10 days ago.
Well, then why hasn't he come here?
Don't know. We think he must have got some news of Abby.
Oh, good. Are you going to stay?
-Well, I hope so. If you'll have me.
-ARTHUR: Not much doubt about that.
You couldn't have come at a better time.
-I've put that fat in the outhouse.
-Thanks.
I know it's tough, but it's worth it.
-At least you're spared the potash bit.
-Hmm. That's what you think.
How many times is the wind in the east?
You want to try working on top of it.
No, thank you. It's worse than being downwind of Hubert.
-You're making soap?
-However did you guess?
It's odd that something that smells so awful can make one clean.
That's life.
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.
How about a cup of tea?
-Tea?
-Carrot tea.
Have you tried clover and marjoram?
-No.
-Well, it's delightful.
-Really?
-And there's tansy, thyme, filarian, rosemary, chamomile, nettle, marigold tea.
They're all remedial recipes as well.
I ought to warn you,
Ruth used to be a medical student.
RUTH: You know something about herbal cures?
Well, I...
-Go on, there's no competition.
-Except for Mina.
-Who?
-Mina.
She lives in a cottage in the woods.
She goes in for herbs and things.
-Go on.
-Well, peppermint is very good if you feel sick or have indigestion.
And you can make a herbal ointment out of dandelions, plantain, yellow dock leaf.
I cured a festering cut on my arm that way last month.
He said he had no practical skills.
I think he's got a job, don't you, Ruth?
Absolutely. You and I have got to get together, Alistair.
-Mmm. Think how much soap you can make.
-Oh, come on, Jenny.
You've been obsessive about this soap ever since you got back from London.
-Well, someone's got to do it.
-Yes, why does it always have to be me?
-Jenny, that is not fair.
-No, it isn't. I agree.
I'm just making a cup of tea.
Alistair here is an expert on herbal cures.
Is he? Good.
Now, look.
Greg and I have just been talking.
It's no good people complaining about their jobs.
Now this community is run on the basis of everybody doing what they are best at.
Now, if Alistair here knows about herbs, then obviously he'll want to do something about it.
And that's what we must have because we benefit by it.
Yes.
All right, Ruth, Jenny?
Yes.
Ruth?
Yes!
Look, I'm sorry if some of the jobs are hard.
We just haven't got the technology to make them easier.
-Who are you getting at, Charles?
-I'm not getting at anybody.
-'Cause I wasn't complaining.
-Oh, come on, Ruth, you were.
You said you wanted to make more soap and I wasn't producing enough fat.
No, I said there wasn't enough,
-not that you weren't...
-That's exactly the same thing.
-No, it isn't.
-All right, all right, all right.
Let's stop bickering.
In fact, who was complaining about Pet not making enough bread?
-Hubert was.
-RUTH: No, it wasn't Hubert.
Hubert hasn't said anything.
It was you who told Charles.
GREG: We were given three loaves yesterday.
-Now Jack said Hubert was complaining...
-CHARLES: Greg!
GREG: Look, I think it's a good idea to clear the air.
It's no good us all just bottling it up.
Does everybody agree with the principle that we each do what we are best at?
Oh, yes, I was always a marvel at making soap.
I never ever used a supermarket.
Oh, dear. A year ago, we were just happy to be alive.
It's all right for you two.
Keep warm, running about.
-Any more?
-Any more what?
Dogs.
Oh, no, they know what's good for them.
They keep clear of me.
-Ask him.
-No, you.
-No, you.
-No, you ask him.
Hey, hey, hey. What, what?
Jack says if you look at the face of a tiger, into its eyes, it won't attack you.
Well, there ain't no tigers around here.
Unless they come from them wild zoos.
-Is it true, though?
-I don't know.
-Find one and try it.
-I told you it isn't true.
I don't know what he's filling your head with.
If I saw a tiger, I'd run, wouldn't you?
GREG: We don't bicker, do we?
There are times when
I could bash your face in.
-Yes, me too.
-Yours or mine?
-Yours of course.
-Well, I'd like to see you try.
-Oh, Greg.
-Hey, hey, hey. What's this?
-I'm sorry.
-What for?
-Carrying on like this, all weepy.
-Well, there's nothing like a good cry.
I don't think I've got over you going off like that to London.
Well, there was nothing for it,
I'm afraid.
I know. But it showed me what life would be like without you.
I couldn't go on.
I wouldn't want to go on.
Well, you haven't got rid of me yet.
-Promise me you won't go away again.
-Now, you know I can't promise you that.
Yes.
You know what you need is a holiday.
-A what?
-Well, a change.
A break from Paul, the kids and me.
Oh, no.
Look, why don't you go off with Arthur and the others?
He's going to Northwich next week to get some salt. You could go with him.
-No, Greg.
-Go on.
Pet will look after the kids for a week.
-No.
-Why not?
No!
-Well, will you think about it?
-No.
Please.
Please, Jenny.
All right, I'll think about it.
ALISTAIR: Hello.
I don't think we've met.
I'm Alistair McFadden.
Hubert.
-What's in the bag?
-I'm collecting herbs.
-Herbs?
-For medical purposes.
You haven't seen any holly up here, have you?
Holly?
The leaves are good for coughs and colds.
-You make a drink from them.
-Oh!
Sounds as if it was made for me, then.
I'm out in all weathers.
You're not ill, are you?
Oh, well, I shall be, the way my roof lets the water in.
I'll press on, then.
-Where are you staying?
-In the white house.
-With Arthur Russell.
-Thought so.
So what's the trouble?
It's that new Alistair fellow, he's in Arthur Russell's place.
Well, he's in the same house, yes.
It strikes me them's last in is best served.
Hubert, I can't order people to go inviting everybody...
Look, living together is a matter of personal agreement.
It's not his place.
It belongs to all of us.
Look, we established somebody responsible for each place.
No, what I mean is, them who get here first get the best, them who come here last get the best, and I'm in the middle.
What I've got is no good, the roof leaks.
Jack's gonna fix that just as soon as he's finished with the stockade.
Fix it? I'm frozen to death up there.
Got no one to look after me.
-Well, go on.
-Well, it's not fair, is it?
So, you're not the only one out in the cold, you know, Hubert?
Would you rather be in here making soap?
Let somebody else look after the sheep?
She's not outside, is she? She's supposed to be looking after the pigs.
You don't have to be with the pigs every minute.
But I do with the sheep.
I can't let them roam, not with them wild dogs about.
So you want to be taken off the sheep all together, is that it?
Even off the slaughter, getting oil for the lamps?
And out of that room.
Look, Hubert.
We each have jobs.
Now your job is just as important as everybody else.
You're the only one who knows about sheep.
You can't work out a roster for a shepherd any more than you can for a carpenter or a mechanic.
You can't swap those jobs now, can you?
You can houses, though.
Why couldn't that Alistair fellow be put in with me?
What's wrong with me?
Have I got the Death on me or something?
CHARLES: I just wondered what you thought, that's all.
Well, first of all,
I'm not having Hubert in here with me.
-He's dirty and he's objectionable.
-Thank you.
What's all the fuss about anyway?
While he's out, he gets his food brought to him.
His job was being a shepherd, wasn't it?
Well, he thinks Alistair, being educated, is part of an elite.
He means Alistair being clean.
I don't know.
Hubert sees Alistair gathering herbs, and to Hubert that's a cushy number.
-Hubert is a damn nuisance.
-Oh, well, I don't know.
Who would have thought we'd have Ruth and Jenny arguing?
Now we've got Hubert grousing over this new man.
Oh, these last few days, it's been one bone after another.
Okay.
-Let me give you a hand.
-No, it's all right, we can manage.
-I'd rather.
-Look, don't worry, we're all right.
Would you like me to stay and help?
No, it's all right.
Thanks, Alistair. We can manage now.
Is there anything I can do?
That's all right, sunshine, you've done enough.
Why don't you go and pick me some dandelion and burdock?
My throat's parched.
Thanks.
HUBERT: It is him, innit?
Where did you find this?
I told you, on the way up the top where he was herb picking.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
-Hubert...
-I done the right thing, haven't I,
-bringing it?
-Yes, yes, you have.
If he goes, can I have his room?
Well, first we'll have to establish whether it is him, Hubert, and then we'll decide what to do.
Oh, I see. If you don't want him to go, you want it to be kept quiet.
Well, I can keep things quiet if I'm treated proper.
Nobody can say I haven't acted for the best now, can they?
I have a complaint to make.
Something has been taken from my pocket.
Are you Andrew McAlister?
Yes.
I was in the hospital, prison, when the Death came.
The keys stopped turning in the big locks and the bangings and the shoutings went.
When I got better, I took the minibus, filled it with food from the kitchens and I left.
I found a house, a large house, empty, by the river.
It had a library.
And I caught fish.
There was plenty of food.
I lit fires and I read books.
Why did you keep this?
Because it's real.
Tells me who I am and what I did.
-What did you do?
-I killed a child.
-Why?
-Because she was looking at me and she was frightened.
I was angry that she should be frightened, there was no reason why.
And that frightened me.
That in me, there was something frightening.
I couldn't tolerate a small child frightening me, and in my rage, I killed her.
Did a psychiatrist tell you this?
Psychiatrists tell you nothing.
They ask questions to write reports so that they can file judgements.
Then how do you know?
Because I thought about it when I got better.
And how did I get better?
Well, first, because everyone
I knew was dead.
I'd seen their bodies.
Even in my persecuted state,
I knew that.
At first, I was glad they were dead.
I thought I'd killed them.
No one came near me, no one threatened me.
The locks had gone, the drugs, the questions.
I read the poetry I found in the house.
Couldn't read the novels, they were about people and things and places.
But the poetry I understood.
I used to sit by the river and look at the water and the trees.
I was calm and peaceful.
And then it was there, in the poem in front of me.
"Nature and language has a sense, the anchor of my purest thoughts,
"the nurse, the guide, the guardian of my heart and soul
"of all my moral being."
The Death had cured me.
I believe there are people who are not meant to live in crowded towns or suffer the corruption of commercial pressure because it moves them away from themselves, from the reality of their own existence.
They are unable to feel, to express, to know who they are.
And so they become tortured and frightened.
And like an animal that's cornered, they strike out.
And so they have to be locked away with other frightened creatures, to be treated with drugs and electric shock and the kindly understanding you reserve for naughty children, but not love.
Not love because that means sharing.
And how can you share with an animal in a cage?
You're quite sure you know what you're doing, Ruth?
It's not what I'm doing, we all decided by majority.
No, no. It's just the majority of the people who were here.
What about the others,
Peggy, Maureen, Mina, Alan, Lewis?
You're going to convince everybody in the community?
If I can see each of them individually, yes.
-What about Hubert?
-I'll see Hubert.
Hubert was trying to blackmail me, either keep quiet about it or kick Alistair out.
-Either way, he wants Alistair's room.
-Well, he's not getting that.
I'll simply tell him that if he breathes a word to anyone before Ruth's had a chance to speak to them, he's going to be the one who's out on his neck.
What happens if he falls ill again?
After all, he's done it once.
Arthur, weren't you listening to him?
He has total clear insight into what he did and why he did it.
That's the whole point of psychoanalytic treatment, if a patient knows himself.
That's why he carries the cutting,
'cause he's not afraid any longer.
That is the cure. He knows who he is.
I thought perhaps he carried it to remind himself in case he felt like doing it again.
Go home, you old reactionary.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Well, we may be primitive by circumstance, but we're civilised by choice.
I think that's what matters.
You know, Hubert was quite prepared to keep it quiet
-as long as he was all right.
-Mmm.
Maybe he thought a child-killer was no threat to him.
Exactly. And that is even worse.
He's a murderer and he's got a better place to live than what I have.
Hubert, I want you to promise you won't say a word about this.
Give Ruth a chance to speak to everyone, all right?
What did he want to come here for in the first place? That's what I want to know.
Well, he came here for the same reasons we all did.
For food, shelter and safety.
But he was on his own for a year you said.
I said he was on his own till he was cured.
And when he was cured, he wanted to be with people again.
Now for God's sake, will you give this man a chance?
You promise?
All right, I promise.
If I get a better place.
Hubert, if I hear you've been spreading stories, you won't have anywhere.
-Have Greg and Jack gone up?
-Yeah.
Hey, come here.
-You want to be careful.
-Why? What's happened?
You see him?
That's Alistair.
Yeah. Remember what I was telling you about tigers?
Well, if I told you some people could be like tigers, you know, dangerous, kill people, you wouldn't hang about and wait for it to happen, would you? You'd run away.
Well, if he asks you to help him or do anything, don't, understand?
Off you go. Hey, now don't tell anybody
I told you because if he finds out...
-But that's Alistair.
-Yeah, he looks harmless, doesn't he?
Ever seen a smile on the face of a tiger?
Tigers can look nice, but they can tear you to bits.
How you getting on?
-What's the matter?
-Ran into Hubert.
-Uh-huh. And what did he have to say?
-Something about wasn't I being silly.
-About what?
-Being out on my own and leaving the baby.
Well, go on.
Oh, for goodness sake, Greg, you know what he meant.
I can't stand the man.
He frightens me and he enjoys doing it.
Yes, but he didn't actually mention
Alistair by name, did he?
No, he didn't produce a pencil and paper and write it out for me.
If anything goes wrong in this settlement, you can guarantee Hubert's got something to do with it.
He's got to needle and probe until he gets exactly what he wants.
Well, I can't see why somebody can't mend his roof.
Jack's got an important job to do finishing that stockade.
-Once he's done that, he can help.
-Till somebody mends his roof, why can't somebody else put up with the smell?
All right, I'll have a word with Charles in the morning.
-They're not here.
-I'm going back to feed the pigs.
I'll wait here for them.
Hubert, can I have a word?
Greg and Charles have asked if you can move into my place while your roof's being mended.
Well, I'm not prepared to do that, but I am willing to give you a hand to get the roof repaired.
Shouldn't be too difficult.
Lots of tiles that will fit from those old outhouses.
Well, at least it'll reduce the leak until it can be done properly.
Well, we'll get somebody else to look after the sheep while we're doing the roof.
We're supposed to have our own jobs, aren't we?
I got enough to do out here without bothering about roofs.
All right.
Well, don't say I didn't offer to help.
Oh, no, plenty of people get your offers of help.
Them who come here last get the best places to live.
It was the same before the Death.
Privilege for the few.
It'll always be the same.
John.
John.
John!
John!
-Alistair... Are you going?
-I shouldn't have come.
-Where will you go?
-I'll find a house by a river somewhere.
-Is it because of Hubert?
-Not especially.
Or because of what you think we might be thinking?
Well, I admit I was suspicious, but I suppose you wouldn't expect people
-like Hubert to understand.
-No, it's not that. Not in itself.
When I was in business, before,
I used to sack people.
I never saw them again, never gave them a second thought.
But now, everybody, even Hubert, seems significant.
I'm sorry you're going.
I thought the Death would change everything. It saved me.
When I heard about this place and all of you...
You thought we would be changed as much?
I thought we'd all be changed, completely.
Well, maybe it will be one day.
You see, I came out of a nightmare into reality.
And it's reality which is so wonderful.
Just living without people.
Can you understand that?
So I thought... I didn't think, but I expected to find people that didn't argue and bicker over petty things like soap.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Maybe I am only able to exist in a vacuum, without people.
Anyway...
The only reason we're all here together is that we couldn't survive on our own.
-I did.
-Till your food ran out.
I'll go to the town and get food.
One of our lot went to a town to get medicine. He died.
Three of them went up to London.
There are 500 people in London trying to get away before they're wiped out.
There are many ways of dying.
Yes, but when, Lizzie? How long ago?
One hour? Two hours?
Did he definitely say he'd stay up there, Lizzie?
-Until Greg came. Is that what he said?
-Yes.
Lizzie, now listen, love, have you seen John since you came down from the top?
-No.
-Well, he's not up there now.
Hubert said he hadn't seen him come down.
Did say he'd seen Alistair go up there and come down since then.
-Where's Alistair now?
-Well, I think I can tell you that.
It's rather sad news, really.
Alistair's had enough of us. He's gone.
Well, I did try to persuade him...
-Look, when did he go?
-About five minutes ago. Why?
-What's happened?
-John's disappeared.
And Alistair was the last one seen near.
I don't believe it.
I've just been talking to him.
He was just explaining how good everything was.
Yes, without people.
He told us all that, didn't he?
See my baby, I must see my baby.
Did you follow him at all?
-No.
-Why not?
-Because I was angry.
-Angry with John?
I didn't touch him.
When were you angry?
Before he ran away or after?
When he looked at me.
-How did he look at you?
-He was frightened.
-Why was he frightened?
-I don't know.
-But you remembered...
-Yes.
-You remembered...
-The child I killed, yes.
Did you feel there was something in you to be frightened of?
I couldn't understand why he was frightened unless someone had told him.
-And that made you angry?
-Yes.
We've been all over. Nothing. I've got three men on horses on the road.
Alistair, a child is missing.
You were the last person to see him.
You were seen going up to the fences.
Lizzie came down from it.
Do you understand why we have to ask you these questions?
Oh, yes, I understand.
Well, we can't drag the canal or the lake, we haven't got a boat.
We can stretch a rope across, with men on either side.
Weight it so it sinks.
Do you also understand why we brought you back?
-And why we've got to keep you here?
-Yes, for my own protection.
It used to always be like that.
Anything yet?
-Is Charles back?
-No.
What are we going to do?
We haven't any proof.
We haven't got a prison.
We can't just lock him up with someone standing over him.
We may as well let him go.
I mean, what can we do?
I don't know. I've just been back past our house. Hubert's sounding forth.
It's all too simple to someone like Hubert.
-You shoot wild dogs.
-We're not shooting anyone, Greg.
No. No, I've already decided to let him go.
-When?
-At first light.
-Where is he?
-He's through there.
-Is he alone?
-He's asleep.
What if they find something tomorrow?
I mean, what about Charles?
Shouldn't you ask?
What if you're wrong, Greg?
What if they do find something tomorrow?
Well, then I'm wrong and Charles is right.
And I'm not going through a murder trial again.
Again?
Ah, it was a long time ago.
We got an engineer, an architect, a carpenter, shepherd and a doctor.
But we haven't got any policemen.
Until we do have, I think we should all just stick to our own jobs.
All right, all right, I'm coming.
All right.
-What do you want?
-Who was right, then?
You been drinking?
Where did you get that from?
Same place Ruth got hers.
You didn't know about that, did you?
While I'm up there...
If that's what I think it is, you'll kill yourself.
It's methyl alcohol, you idiot. It's an antiseptic. You'll poison yourself.
It tastes all right. It's nice in here.
-Nice and warm and dry.
-What do you want?
-We both saw it, what he did.
-What are you talking about?
You and me saw that Alistair hit John.
-We damn well did not.
-I say we did.
What are you trying to tell me, Hubert?
The man's a murderer.
He shouldn't be allowed to be here.
-What do you want, Hubert?
-If I say I saw him hit John, more likely to believe that than if you say he didn't.
-Oh, for God's sake...
-No, what I'm trying to say is, if you say nothing about what you saw him do to John, you can let me have his room.
Favour is a favour.
Oh, get out.
Oh, all right, I'm going, but I'll get a big stick, and I'll do what Greg said he'd do to me.
And I'll find him, and if don't find him...
Hubert's roaming around drunk.
He says he's going to...
GREG: That's all right, he's not going anywhere.
-Shouldn't we tell Charles?
-No, he's asleep.
Don't you worry, Arthur,
I'll take care of it.
It's all right, it was only Arthur.
Go on back to bed.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.
Shouldn't you have someone outside if you fall asleep?
I won't fall asleep.
Go on, back to bed, Charles.
All right.
Go on, drink it up.
It's going to be a cold day.
I'll take you as far as the reservoir.
Where have you been?
-I went on the road.
-Well, why didn't you come back?
-It's the rule.
-What rule?
If you go out and come back, you have to stay here.
It's quarantine.
He's all right now.
He stopped shivering hugging the hot water bottle.
Well, Hubert's a mess.
He actually tried to get me to admit that I saw Alistair hit John.
Yeah, and what's worse is him actually frightening the boy.
Well, I warned him.
-Well, what do we do with him?
-What can you do?
If you throw him out, he'd die through self-neglect.
You couldn't persuade Alistair to stay?
No.
Where is Hubert?
JACK: Hubert.
-Hubert's knockout drops.
-Oh, no.
-Is it your stuff?
-No, no. It's not methyl alcohol.
But it's the rest of the brandy
I'd saved.
For the same purpose, medicinal.
That man is a thief, Charles, he has to go.
ARTHUR: Hear, hear.
-How's John?
-He's fine.
He's just got a little chill, that's all. He'll be all right.
What was that herbal drink that Alistair suggested for colds?
-Do you remember, Ruth?
-Yes. Holly leaves.
-But we don't know how to make it.
-Oh, I don't know. Complete herbal.
The other one's not so useful, poetry by Wordsworth. Selected works.
Let's have a look.
Poor man, first we hound him out and put him through all of that, and then he leaves his books behind.
Well, he's marked this one.
I think he meant us to have it.
Listen. "'Tis nature's law that none, the meanest of created things,
"of forms created the most vile and brute, the dullest or most noxious,
"should exist divorced from good,
"a spirit and pulse of good,
"a life and soul to every mode of being, inseparably linked."
"The meanest of created things."
Obviously, he means Hubert.
I'm going to miss Alistair.
Well, he left us something useful.
Why should we be stuck with Hubert and that man out there?
Come on, we've all got work to do.
How do you know it was Hubert that told John when he marked that book last night?
Who did he mean, then?
Well, I think he meant everyone, including himself.
And by the way, Greg, took a chance last night, didn't you?
Letting him go without consulting me?
Would it have made any difference?
ALISTAIR: "'Tis nature's law that none,
the meanest of created things,
"of forms created the most vile
and brute, the dullest or most noxious,
"should exist divorced from good,
"a spirit and pulse of good,
"a life and soul to every mode of being
inseparably linked."
{4356}{4382}When I give|the word!

{4804}{4822}Sorry,|Maisie.
{4828}{4844}No passengers|allowed.
{4850}{4886}Tell you what, Innes.|I'll bet you 50 guineas
{4892}{4937}my coach and four'll|beat you to the other side.
{4943}{4988}Good idea! While|you're galloping over the top
{4994}{5038}we'll be drilling|through the middle.
{5048}{5103}That'll do.|Stop there.
{5156}{5189}Thank you.
{5210}{5216}Doc?
{5222}{5253}Oh, David,|my dear fellow,
{5261}{5285}what a proud|moment this is.
{5291}{5355}I hope your faith|in me will be fully justified.
{5366}{5390}I just made|a wager.
{5396}{5420}A little champagne|to success?
{5426}{5474}Oh, yes,|I'll... I'll drink to that.
{5495}{5532}Oh, no.|I'd better not.
{5538}{5557}I-I'm at|the controls
{5563}{5610}and you must keep|a clear head, too, David.
{5625}{5660}Winterbottom...|Mr. Innes, sir.
{5678}{5714}Dowsett,|of the times.
{5720}{5751}How do you do, sir?|How do you do?
{5757}{5778}This is dr.|Abner Perry.
{5784}{5815}How do you do?|How do you do, sir?
{5821}{5847}Dr. Perry|was kind enough
{5853}{5891}to nominate me|as his worst student.
{5897}{5928}It took me|longer to graduate
{5934}{5964}from geological|engineering
{5970}{5987}than any other|man alive.
{5993}{6040}Oh, but you|had many fine qualities, David.
{6053}{6086}But you were|rather slow.
{6092}{6122}And that is|rather surprising
{6128}{6170}because his|father was so clever.
{6176}{6206}One of the best|we ever had
{6212}{6257}in, uh, '58,|I think it was.
{6272}{6297}Oh, yes,|yes, '58.
{6303}{6325}Dear old dad.
{6331}{6379}He should've|been here to see the mole.
{6385}{6420}Ah, that is|what you call it?
{6426}{6451}The... the|"iron mole"?
{6457}{6479}That's what|I call it.
{6485}{6508}Dr. Perry here,|calls it
{6514}{6551}a high-calibration|digging machine.
{6557}{6599}It'll bore|through solid rock
{6605}{6655}at a rate|of 78 feet per minute.
{6662}{6709}And this is|your design, dr. Perry?
{6715}{6747}The finance has|been provided
{6753}{6785}by Mr. Innes,|I gather.
{6791}{6805}Oh, pardon me.
{6811}{6854}David,|gyroscopes.
{6860}{6886}I know that|today is just
{6892}{6922}a test-run through|our welsh hills...
{6928}{6967}Good day. David, come along.|Good day, sir.
{6981}{6994}But can you|tell me,
{7000}{7042}is it really|your intention to eventually explore
{7048}{7093}deep into|the bowels of the earth?
{7099}{7156}Sir, we've been|on top of the earth long enough.
{7162}{7227}It's about time|we found out what's underneath.
{7523}{7554}Great crowd,|huh, doc?
{7560}{7618}Concentrate,|David. Close doors.
{7713}{7748}Locks on.
{7764}{7797}All secure.
{7804}{7820}Ahh!
{7826}{7847}How are we?
{7853}{7870}Ready to go,|doc?
{7876}{7923}Oh, yes!|Yes, my dear fellow.
{7932}{7988}I'll just check|the gyroscopes.
{8073}{8099}Ahh!
{8105}{8138}Very nice.
{8153}{8217}Well, would you like|to move off, my boy?
{8228}{8257}Ready and|willing, doc.
{8263}{8311}Good luck,|and happy landings.
{8363}{8371}Oh, dear.
{8377}{8435}Where is that smoke|coming from?
{8441}{8494}Ah, yes. Well, you'd|better put that out
{8500}{8542}until we're|underway.
{8548}{8593}Procedure check.
{8646}{8682}Vision ports.
{8694}{8743}Opening vision|ports.
{8935}{8964}Control.
{8975}{8996}Begin lift,
{9002}{9049}steady up|to 10 degrees.
{9071}{9132}Check the|inclinometer as we go, David.
{9230}{9264}Milford,|get the horses ready,
{9270}{9309}otherwise I|shall lose 50 guineas.
{9315}{9333}No cheating,|Archie.
{9339}{9386}You can't|start until they're off.
{9546}{9610}15...|right. Hold at that and lock off.
{9616}{9672}Locked off.|Thank you, control.
{9689}{9743}Vision lights,|aft.
{9776}{9828}Vision lights,|forward.
{9853}{9887}Nose-cutters.
{10017}{10033}Right!
{10039}{10088}Bring in the|crawler banks.
{10214}{10271}Firing engines,|now.
{10390}{10412}Here we go.
{10645}{10675}Release.
{10789}{10829}Up a little|on the throttles, David.
{10853}{10894}I have her at 1800.
{10979}{11004}Oh! Back up,|David!
{11098}{11135}Going in again.
{11273}{11290}Gripping now.
{11296}{11328}Cut in|the tail pan.
{11334}{11359}Tail pan at 300.
{11365}{11406}Come on,|girls. Off we go.
{11412}{11453}Come on,|Milford.
{11471}{11514}Steady|the throttles.
{11550}{11585}We're in.
{11685}{11705}Slow her down,|David.
{11711}{11776}On the throttles.|Don't cut the engines.
{11847}{11855}Whew!
{11861}{11899}By gad!|That cannot be possible.
{11905}{11961}Quick. What does|the distance meter read?
{11974}{12009}Confounded|contraption!
{12015}{12045}It should be|700 feet deep
{12051}{12108}by the time we get|it back to horizontal.
{12204}{12245}She's going|too fast.
{12317}{12348}I can't change|her course,
{12354}{12408}most extraordinary|thing!
{12453}{12504}The mole is burning|up inside, doc.
{12596}{12665}Can you... can you just|take over, David?
{12684}{12733}I-I must...
{12739}{12797}don't give up, sir|I can't, I...
{12814}{12839}ah, oh, ah...
{12845}{12894}Doc! Doc Perry!
{12916}{12965}Ohh!|Don't...
{14130}{14179}Perry! Doc?
{14256}{14307}Oh, Doc!|Huh?
{14333}{14344}Doc!|Oh!
{14350}{14401}You all right?|Where wh-where was I?
{14476}{14509}It's c-c-c-old.
{14538}{14578}The temperature...|hmmm?
{14592}{14625}Look at it.
{14635}{14675}I can't see|a thing.
{14681}{14707}Oh!
{14713}{14727}Ice.
{14733}{14785}Ice. It can't|be possible.
{14795}{14860}Fascinating. Just|make a note of the...
{14880}{14885}oh!
{14891}{14950}Just make a note of|the temperature, will you?
{15016}{15054}She's going up!
{15075}{15119}A little more|throttle, David.
{15340}{15367}Temperature's|rising, doc.
{15373}{15403}We're on our|way home.
{15442}{15454}Not quite.
{15460}{15501}We appear to be, uh,|in the middle
{15507}{15568}of a... an underground|lake at the moment.
{15675}{15690}Ohh!
{15696}{15712}Excellent!
{15718}{15732}Excellent!
{15738}{15793}Lifting nicely.|Knew she'd do it.
{15801}{15817}Lifting nicely?
{15823}{15869}Bom bom bom|bom bom de de bom
{15875}{15934}bom bom bom|bom bom de de bom
{15977}{16009}Hold on, doc!
{16173}{16207}Hold on.
{16333}{16367}Ohh!
{16719}{16770}Total|power failure?
{16776}{16821}Oh, how very|disappointing.
{16827}{16856}It must've been|the water.
{16862}{16923}I didn't allow|for that contingency.
{16943}{16967}Well, doc,
{16973}{17015}shall we see|where we are?
{17027}{17046}Yes.
{17052}{17065}Oh.
{17071}{17122}I'll, uh, just|get my umbrella.
{17133}{17190}The weather seems|so changeable.
{17239}{17276}Ah!
{17282}{17342}Ah, where did I put it|amongst all this lot?
{17357}{17392}Ah! There it is.
{17909}{17939}Doc?
{17961}{17982}Doc!
{17988}{18027}Yes... yes. What?
{18033}{18060}Come on.|Come here, quick.
{18066}{18128}I really must|check the reason
{18145}{18182}for that|power failure.
{18188}{18229}I don't like|being...
{18328}{18384}what an|unbelievable sight.
{18453}{18467}Oop!
{18473}{18508}Steady,|doc.
{18532}{18560}David!
{18566}{18573}This can't be
{18579}{18646}the other side|of the hill, surely.
{18652}{18717}Unless it's|changed dramatically.
{18849}{18882}Well,|where are we?
{18902}{18962}Look at this|Mesozoic moss.
{18979}{19018}Or is it|a cycad?
{19038}{19065}I'm not sure,|I...
{19071}{19140}I've only seen it|before in fossilized form.
{19146}{19171}I would dearly|love to
{19177}{19203}take a frond|back with me.
{19209}{19251}Great, doc.|Just great.
{19257}{19310}But where on|earth can we be?
{19358}{19376}Doc?
{19382}{19400}Oh, I say.
{19406}{19445}Steady, they|may be stingers.
{19451}{19505}Onward,|dear boy.
{19647}{19708}What an|extraordinary sky.
{19745}{19795}What a strange|color, doc.
{19804}{19868}This cannot be|the Rhondda valley.
{19895}{19951}I've never seen|anything like it.
{19957}{20002}Like nothing|on earth.
{20210}{20253}David?
{20259}{20304}We are not|on earth.
{20310}{20324}We're not...
{20330}{20357}well, if we're|not on earth, doc,
{20363}{20381}then where|the hell are we?
{20387}{20434}From my|observations, dear friend,
{20440}{20519}I can positively|state that we are under it.
{20555}{20567}Under?
{20573}{20627}At the|earth's core.
{20797}{20839}By Jove!
{20850}{20894}How very|interesting.
{20958}{20984}Uh, d-doc...
{20990}{20996}mmm?
{21002}{21024}I-I don't|think you
{21030}{21071}want to get too|close to that.
{21173}{21178}Yes.
{21184}{21258}It is a somewhat|aggressive looking... creature.
{21652}{21690}David!
{21696}{21727}Oh, dear!
{21772}{21810}David,|don't lose contact.
{21841}{21879}Doc!
{21970}{22013}Shoo! Shoo!
{22082}{22114}Oh!
{22269}{22300}Oh!
{22436}{22467}Oh, oh dear!
{22526}{22557}Oh!
{22631}{22666}Ohh!|No, doc. This way.
{22687}{22722}Oh, dear.|Oh!
{22765}{22801}Here.|Oh, dear.
{22824}{22876}Take care of|yourself, David.
{22896}{22930}Oh!|Hang on, doc.
{23469}{23504}David?
{23520}{23558}Hang on, doc.
{23625}{23655}Oh!
{23748}{23778}Ugh!
{23930}{23962}Take that!
{24266}{24294}Come on!
{24350}{24382}You ugly...
{25633}{25665}Oh, dear.
{25671}{25696}Oh, oh, I say!
{25793}{25835}I say,|do be careful.
{26298}{26343}But we came|in peace!
{26546}{26576}Ugh!
{26661}{26691}Oh, oh, David,
{26697}{26751}how good|to see that you're safe.
{26757}{26768}Ohh!
{26774}{26834}Did you ever see anything like this before?
{26843}{26850}No.
{26856}{26891}Those prisoners|look human.
{26897}{26907}Yes.
{26913}{26925}And they|appear to be
{26931}{26975}intellectually|superior to our captors.
{26981}{27014}I do find|that interesting.
{27020}{27072}They seem a pretty|subhuman species,
{27078}{27099}yet the|master race.
{27105}{27128}Isn't that|always the way?
{27134}{27186}Yes, the power|of aggression, dear boy.
{27192}{27227}Brawn|before brains.
{27233}{27252}No! Don't|hit him!
{27258}{27330}I'll remember him, doc,|but they all look the same.
{27336}{27380}Yes.
{28367}{28405}Ugh!
{28788}{28800}David,
{28806}{28857}don't you think|it's about time we introduced
{28863}{28925}ourselves to|our fellow sufferers?
{28931}{29000}Dr. Abner Perry|at your service, ma'am.
{29059}{29102}David.
{29108}{29124}Dia.
{29130}{29174}Dia?
{29204}{29246}You can|call him Doc.
{29280}{29322}Ghak.|Oh, Ghak.
{29417}{29444}Oh!
{29450}{29476}Dia?
{29482}{29513}Who's that man|up in front
{29519}{29552}who keeps|looking at me?
{29558}{29602}He is Hoojah|the sly one.
{29608}{29654}Do not|trust him.
{30470}{30499}Perry?
{30566}{30616}Doesn't it ever|get dark here?
{30632}{30649}According|to my watch,
{30655}{30695}we've been|traveling for 2 days.
{30701}{30745}No, here there|can be no night.
{30751}{30801}Just perpetual|daylight.
{30807}{30852}We are in a cave,|you understand,
{30873}{30897}a gigantic cave.
{30903}{30942}And the sky|is the underside
{30948}{30981}of the earth's crust...
{30987}{30993}the magma,
{30999}{31079}probably something|like 20 miles above us.
{31112}{31145}Oh.
{31268}{31308}Conserve|your energy, dear boy.
{31314}{31346}We're both|going to need it.
{31352}{31391}That was my|father's watch.
{31397}{31436}Unpleasant|character.
{31442}{31491}Oh, dear!
{31510}{31560}Dia?
{31569}{31608}Who are they?
{31670}{31683}Sagoths,
{31689}{31727}soldiers of|the Mahars.
{31733}{31778}Oh, and... and|pardon me,
{31784}{31824}what are|Mahars?
{31830}{31863}Mahars rule|Pellucidar,
{31869}{31927}and Sagoths take us|to be slaves in their city.
{31933}{31981}What a charming prospect.Dia.
{32056}{32101}Aghh!
{32117}{32155}Agh!
{32607}{32650}Dia!
{32693}{32715}Your act|of chivalry
{32721}{32772}didn't seem very|popular, David.
{33024}{33073}Ahhh!
{35652}{35686}Pardon me.
{35721}{35770}Doc!
{36061}{36067}David!
{36073}{36137}That must be|the city of the Mahars.
{36276}{36321}Oh! Do watch|that thing!
{36335}{36376}Ohh!
{36390}{36428}Uhh!
{36451}{36486}Oh, they're|so excitable,
{36492}{36527}like all|foreigners.
{36533}{36548}Dia.
{36554}{36600}Dia!
{36606}{36636}I just wanted|to ask her
{36642}{36666}how much|farther.
{36672}{36724}They're giving|us the cold shoulder, David.
{36730}{36758}We certainly|seem to have
{36764}{36808}blotted our|copybook somehow.
{36814}{36856}Ohh!
{37075}{37120}Ugh!
{37416}{37428}David,|I-I...
{37434}{37477}I'm sorry to|be a burden, but I...
{37483}{37534}I don't think|I can go on much longer.
{37540}{37550}Come on,|doc.
{37556}{37623}It can't be|much farther.
{37846}{37884}Oh!
{38582}{38634}Noisy lot, aren't they, David?
{38732}{38774}Ah.
{39018}{39042}Doc?
{39048}{39066}Mmm?
{39072}{39109}Dia...
{39115}{39131}Dia,|she's gone.
{39137}{39156}Uh?|She's not here?
{39162}{39189}Ghak,
{39198}{39269}what happened|to Dia?
{39302}{39349}Hoojah|the sly one.
{39355}{39409}He escaped|with the girl you refused.
{39416}{39468}I what?|You insulted Dia.
{39474}{39533}Do you not|know what you have done?
{39545}{39552}No.
{39558}{39597}When a man from|Pellucidar fights
{39603}{39639}with another man|for a woman,
{39645}{39700}she belongs|to he who wins.
{39714}{39757}Well, you should've|claimed her
{39763}{39784}or released her.
{39790}{39821}But you showed|contempt
{39827}{39873}for her by|doing nothing.
{39890}{39952}Now no man can|take her as mate
{39977}{40039}until he's overcome|you in combat.
{40126}{40141}I didn't know.
{40147}{40213}I-I thought I was|protecting her.
{40242}{40272}Forgive me,
{40284}{40334}for you could|not have known.
{40399}{40436}Dia was in hiding
{40449}{40483}from Jubal,
{40507}{40542}the ugly one.
{40579}{40596}He is a man with
{40602}{40661}the strength|of many men.
{40679}{40713}And he has made|it known that
{40719}{40775}he wants Dia|for his mate.
{40818}{40833}There is no one
{40839}{40873}who can defend|her against him,
{40879}{40929}and so Dia|fled to the hills.
{40965}{41039}Only to be captured|by a Sagoth raiding party.
{41161}{41233}There is something|you should know, my friend.
{41264}{41302}Dia is a princess,
{41347}{41384}the daughter|of kings.
{41448}{41476}She is proud
{41482}{41516}and she will|never forgive you,
{41522}{41564}even if you did|find her again,
{41570}{41623}which you will not.
{41644}{41701}We are all doomed|to slavery...
{41750}{41784}and death.
{42060}{42131}They are no respecters of age, are they?
{42412}{42421}David!
{42427}{42478}What a|phenomenal sight...
{42502}{42540}a fire|curtain!
{42572}{42621}Ooh!
{43935}{43990}Ugh!
{44734}{44771}David!|What?
{44777}{44807}A Rhamphorhynchus
{44813}{44862}of the middle|Jurassic period.
{45178}{45212}My goodness,|how enormous.
{45218}{45282}Why, the largest|remains we ever discovered
{45288}{45335}have never|indicated a size much greater
{45341}{45395}than that|attained by an ordinary crow.
{47590}{47607}Oh!|Hey!
{47613}{47647}What are|you doing?
{47653}{47671}Oh, oh!
{47677}{47710}Doc!
{48338}{48359}Oh!
{48365}{48374}Perry!
{48380}{48409}Take care|of yourself.
{48415}{48435}I will, and you.
{48441}{48496}You are beginning|to annoy me.
{49455}{49503}Ghak,|one at a time.
{49509}{49559}You've got|a long day.
{49740}{49759}Ahh!
{49765}{49813}Ah, there|you are, my friend.
{49819}{49872}Another one|for the shelves.
{49894}{49929}Thank you.
{49956}{50002}Now, what|have we got?
{50065}{50098}Hmm.
{50104}{50138}Fascinating.
{50171}{50215}"The Mahar...
{50221}{50258}"is limited...
{50264}{50311}"vocally...
{50369}{50418}"but has been...
{50453}{50498}"endowed...
{50504}{50524}"with...
{50530}{50562}"mesmeric powers...
{50568}{50627}"and a high degree|of telepathy."
{50645}{50661}Hmm.
{50667}{50707}That's quite|a combination,
{50713}{50761}for a bird.
{50912}{50945}I don't know|what it is
{50951}{50990}they're giving|us to eat.
{50996}{51047}Perhaps it's|just as well.
{51114}{51161}Doc?|Mm-hmm?
{51167}{51223}How do we|get out of here?
{51236}{51259}I really|haven't been
{51265}{51285}able to find|out anything
{51291}{51351}definite about the|Mahar's secret yet,
{51358}{51395}except that,
{51406}{51422}in some way,
{51428}{51474}it is connected|with the lava,
{51487}{51520}with the heat.
{51526}{51551}Well, I'm|certainly getting
{51557}{51575}to know|about that.
{51581}{51626}Ahh, but|that is the point, David.
{51632}{51649}Slaves are|used
{51655}{51681}to constantly|repair
{51687}{51729}and divert|the lava channels.
{51735}{51768}You see,|although the lava
{51774}{51792}is of vital|importance,
{51798}{51843}it is also|eating away at the very
{51849}{51895}foundations|of the Mahar city.
{51901}{51938}And so its|flow has to be
{51944}{51996}continually|checked and rechanneled.
{52002}{52055}In fact,|the whole safety of the city
{52061}{52113}is dependant|upon the slaves.
{52120}{52134}And, uh,|we are
{52140}{52190}among their|number now.
{52196}{52238}Oh, there's|cheerful Annie again.
{52244}{52309}Watch yourself,|doc.
{52339}{52370}Doc!
{61178}{61229}Yeah.
{61945}{61987}David.
{61993}{62020}D-David.
{62026}{62058}Ra.|Ra?
{62074}{62106}Hu-rrah.
{62247}{62284}Oh, uh...
{62304}{62358}I don't come|from Pellucidar.
{62368}{62411}I come from|another world.
{62508}{62532}I escaped
{62538}{62568}from the|Mahar city.
{62574}{62643}No one can escape|from the Mahar city.
{62668}{62693}The Mahars
{62699}{62737}are all-seeing,
{62743}{62794}all lethal.
{62810}{62818}Ra,
{62824}{62854}why haven't|you risen up
{62860}{62881}and fought|the Mahars?
{62887}{62935}You do not know|the Mahar.
{62944}{62957}You have not
{62963}{63001}really seen|their
{63007}{63044}power.
{63050}{63087}They're evil!
{63093}{63133}Hmm.
{63165}{63180}Ra,
{63186}{63252}if your tribe|and the others
{63258}{63287}joined together,
{63293}{63339}you could|defeat the Mahars.
{63345}{63390}It's good|thought.
{63418}{63455}But come|with me.
{63469}{63505}I'll show you.
{63520}{63559}Then you'll|understand.
{63807}{63845}Ra?
{63852}{63899}Where are you|taking me?
{64133}{64175}We are now|within the outer walls
{64181}{64212}of the|Mahar grotto.
{64218}{64262}We climb.
{64865}{64903}Ugh!
{65957}{66004}What are these|prisoners doing here?
{66011}{66058}Wait, and you|shall see.
{66078}{66114}You may be|thankful that you're not
{66120}{66184}on the same|side of the wall as they.
{66200}{66240}The Mahars.
{66459}{66502}Are you looking|for someone?
{66516}{66550}Yes.
{66556}{66594}Dia.
{67005}{67056}Thank god|she's not here.
{68603}{68637}Vile cr...
{69590}{69633}They've got|to be destroyed.
{69743}{69778}They've got|to be.
{69784}{69807}Come.
{69813}{69851}We go.
{73780}{73832}David.
{74308}{74330}I'm going back.
{74336}{74383}After what you've|just seen?
{74398}{74452}Especially after|what I've seen.
{74458}{74499}They've got|to be destroyed.
{74509}{74542}David,
{74548}{74600}you're|one man...
{74606}{74651}strong,|it's true.
{74710}{74751}How can|you win?
{74757}{74770}I've got to find
{74776}{74808}the secret|of the Mahars
{74814}{74853}and destroy|them.
{74939}{74970}I'll bring|Ghak back.
{74976}{75021}Ghak?
{75027}{75076}He will not|trust me.
{75082}{75130}No tribe trusts|each other.
{75223}{75267}I know.
{75446}{75515}You go back to|your village, Ra,
{75528}{75572}till the Sagoths|come again.
{75701}{75731}Do you think|I'll let
{75737}{75804}you go back alone?
{75871}{75918}You're a|friend, Ra.
{75924}{75951}Yes,
{75957}{76003}but foolish friend.
{76009}{76070}The Mahars will|make a meal of us.
{76097}{76156}We've just doubled|our strength.
{77336}{77389}It's...
{79972}{80009}David!
{80015}{80037}The ear.
{80043}{80092}Get it behind|the ear.
{80474}{80524}Ahh!
{80710}{80747}The ear!
{82528}{82568}Oh, no!
{83671}{83706}You got him!
{84235}{84280}Bravo!
{84314}{84349}David, above you!
{85240}{85275}Freedom!
{85406}{85442}Freedom!
{85504}{85538}Freedom! Freedom!
{85982}{86020}Come on, doc.
{86209}{86240}Get a tight hold,|doc.
{86246}{86266}I have a|firm grip
{86272}{86304}upon your|trousers, David.
{86310}{86323}David!|What?
{86329}{86367}I found it!|I found the Mahar secret!
{86373}{86401}Come with me.|Not now, doc!
{86407}{86452}But it's just through|this hidey-hole.
{86458}{86524}Come on, me boy,|I'll show you.
{87047}{87093}It's not far|now, David.
{87099}{87146}Be careful|of the edge.
{87399}{87466}It was the|most amazing piece of luck.
{87472}{87514}I practically|stumbled on it.
{87520}{87560}And after pondering|over all those
{87566}{87595}heavy slabs|in the library
{87601}{87648}and learning very|little from them,
{87654}{87703}I got so|dispirited.
{87713}{87723}I kept thinking,
{87729}{87763}"whatever will|I tell David
{87769}{87784}"when he|gets back?"
{87790}{87852}You knew I'd come|back for you, did you?
{87866}{87885}Of course I did.
{87891}{87963}What would I|do without you?
{88065}{88088}There...
{88094}{88132}there it is.
{88138}{88157}The very origin
{88163}{88226}of every Mahar|that's born.
{88232}{88264}Look, David.
{88270}{88315}Do you see|that winch?
{88321}{88350}That is what|controls
{88356}{88412}the fire curtain.
{88564}{88571}This is where
{88577}{88638}we're going|to finish them.
{89265}{89293}It's a|dead end, David.
{89299}{89324}Doc,|in here.
{89330}{89340}Down there?
{89346}{89376}But I'm not|a rabbit, you know.
{89382}{89413}Come on,|doc.
{89566}{89625}Fascinating|rock structure, David.
{89632}{89691}Would you|please, doc... come on!
{89706}{89713}Oh.
{89719}{89771}Oh, I I'll|just sit for a moment.
{89790}{89832}Alright.|Catch your breath.
{89852}{89900}I can't find|my marks.
{89906}{89913}David?
{89919}{89988}Have you ever|thought of going to the moon?
{90014}{90043}Hmm?
{90049}{90064}Come on,|doc.
{90070}{90125}Oh, uh,|wh-which way now?
{90187}{90230}I'm afraid we're lost, doc.
{90248}{90254}Be careful
{90260}{90298}not to graze|yourself on these
{90304}{90363}formidable-looking|rocks here.
{90404}{90437}Oh!
{90443}{90469}I say,
{90475}{90493}there's that...
{90499}{90560}peculiar pellucid|light ahead.
{90566}{90610}Shall we explore?
{90702}{90735}Whoops-a-daisy.
{90741}{90796}Here, doc.|Come on.
{90802}{90841}Watch|yourself.
{90847}{90903}Come on.
{91043}{91088}Oh!
{91094}{91140}Fresh air|at last.
{91206}{91226}David?
{91270}{91313}I'm so sorry,|dear fellow.
{91319}{91337}This place is apt
{91343}{91379}to make one|a little jumpy.
{91385}{91429}Here, sit down.
{91749}{91769}Dia!
{91775}{91824}Come, and I|kill her.
{91989}{92008}Dia!
{92014}{92050}Ahh! David!
{93196}{93228}Bull's-eye!
{93334}{93362}Dia?
{93368}{93377}No.
{93383}{93441}Dia, I thought|I'd never see you again.
{93457}{93507}Dia?
{93558}{93599}Be masterful,|David.
{93626}{93656}Dia?
{93662}{93688}Sit down!
{93694}{93724}Sit down!
{93730}{93756}Now, you listen|to me...
{93762}{93803}no, it's|too late now.
{93838}{93874}When we were|near my village,
{93880}{93897}I managed to escape
{93903}{93919}from Hoojah|the sly one.
{93925}{93966}And now I fear|that Hoojah the sly one
{93972}{94023}will lead Jubal|the ugly one back here.
{94029}{94062}I heard|about him.
{94068}{94095}David, he will|kill you.
{94101}{94134}He is the|strongest warrior
{94140}{94196}in all of|Pellucidar.
{94248}{94294}What, David?
{94429}{94453}The sooner|I meet up
{94459}{94491}with Jubal,|the better.
{94497}{94531}Come on.
{94537}{94556}Come on!
{94562}{94604}Watch your step, doc.
{94613}{94631}Oh, yes.
{94637}{94656}My word,
{94662}{94704}what a fiery|beastie.
{94770}{94801}Oh, your royal|highness,
{94807}{94867}how very nice|to see you again.
{94873}{94898}Remarkably|efficient,
{94904}{94943}these primitive|weapons.
{94949}{94971}I've never had|occasion
{94977}{94991}to use them|before.
{94997}{95053}Ha! The cord|from my spectacles.
{95089}{95106}Oh, y-your|tomahawk
{95112}{95178}came in very useful,|too, David.
{95184}{95235}Brains|before brawn, huh, doc?
{95243}{95266}Oh, a|combination
{95272}{95296}of both,|dear boy.
{95302}{95326}We must|hurry.
{95332}{95401}Yeah, I've|got to find the ugly one.
{95407}{95433}Wouldn't|exactly call
{95439}{95483}him very pretty,|would you?
{95489}{95557}Hey, David!|Wait for me!
{95615}{95638}It's Jubal
{95644}{95686}the ugly one!
{95746}{95772}You can say|that again.
{95778}{95799}Come,|we must hide.
{95805}{95864}No, no, Dia, no!|Come!
{95874}{95901}I'm gonna|have to fight
{95907}{95932}Jubal once|and for all.
{95938}{95964}Stand aside,|David.
{95970}{96029}Doc, I said|this is my fight.
{97438}{97493}Ohh!|David!
{97518}{97575}David...
{97858}{97910}Watch him,|David!
{98436}{98463}That's right,|David.
{98469}{98508}Dia.
{98552}{98582}No! No!
{98588}{98630}Unhand her,|you coward.
{98760}{98798}Aha!
{98840}{98903}Never mind|the Queensberry rules.
{99694}{99750}Well done,|David!
{99829}{99849}Now...
{99855}{99895}you scoundrel.
{100006}{100037}Missed.
{100043}{100066}Well,|at least we
{100072}{100101}put him to his|heels. Hmph!
{100107}{100138}Well done, David!
{100144}{100180}Such courage,|my boy!
{100186}{100241}Such great|courage!
{100247}{100297}David!
{100388}{100426}Jubal!
{100432}{100480}You have|defeated Jubal.
{100529}{100575}Dia is yours.
{100589}{100632}Dia will not|be mine
{100642}{100693}until we destroy|the Mahars
{100699}{100756}and free|Pellucidar.
{101111}{101146}Raise bows.
{101196}{101228}Take aim.
{101260}{101289}Fire!
{101344}{101371}Robin Hood|and his
{101377}{101436}merry men,|what, David?
{101649}{101677}Hear me,
{101683}{101746}leaders of the tribes|of Pellucidar.
{101769}{101803}These strangers
{101809}{101847}came to our world...
{101853}{101904}a world ruled|by the Mahars
{101910}{101939}who have enslaved
{101945}{101995}and tortured us.
{102001}{102059}For as long as|we can recall...
{102065}{102132}our tribes|have been divided.
{102145}{102180}Now,
{102186}{102210}with the help
{102216}{102266}of our new-found|friends
{102272}{102294}we are united.
{102300}{102329}And we have|the strength
{102335}{102350}and the power
{102356}{102406}to destroy once|and for all
{102412}{102474}those who have|enslaved us.
{102493}{102510}Death
{102516}{102569}to the Mahars!
{102988}{103012}Well, David,|would you like
{103018}{103077}to summarize|our deployment?
{103126}{103183}I will lead|the main attack.
{103191}{103217}Ghak,|and his men
{103223}{103267}will cover|the rear.
{103273}{103308}Ra and|Dr. Perry
{103314}{103369}will go ahead|of us
{103375}{103407}through the|lava channel
{103413}{103455}to the inner|sanctum
{103461}{103476}and cut off
{103482}{103521}the main fire|supply.
{103527}{103561}I hate to ask you|to do this, doc,
{103567}{103619}but you know where|the controls are.
{103625}{103643}I'm delighted|to be
{103649}{103693}of some active|service, my boy.
{103699}{103728}Don't you|worry, David.
{103734}{103785}I will take|good care of him.
{103791}{103833}Oh, most|kind.
{103839}{103855}Well,
{103861}{103917}meeting|adjourned, gentlemen.
{103974}{104005}I go with|you, yes?
{104011}{104051}No, Dia.|No.
{104057}{104109}Why not,|David?
{104134}{104146}Dia,
{104152}{104195}the Mahar city is|no place for you.
{104295}{104350}David...|Dia.
{105879}{105894}Ah!
{105900}{105954}This|is it.
{105992}{106018}I must|warn you,
{106024}{106086}it gets very|hot in there.
{107149}{107209}Deuced hot!
{107548}{107606}You could roast|an ox in here.
{108147}{108161}Got you,|you bounder!
{108219}{108246}Oh, I do beg|your pardon,
{108252}{108273}your royal|highness.
{108279}{108335}I-I thought you|were the enemy.
{108341}{108355}No.|Dia,
{108361}{108398}what are you|doing here?
{108404}{108415}It's Hoojah...
{108421}{108471}he has been captured|by the Sagoths.
{108509}{108540}He might|betray us.
{108546}{108578}The traitorous|blighter!
{108584}{108625}What a pity my|arrow missed him.
{108631}{108672}Oh, well.|Quickly, fall in.
{108678}{108703}Follow me. Right.
{108709}{108768}Single file.
{109401}{109436}Retreat!
{109578}{109640}Ra, the|inner sanctum!
{115969}{116018}You cannot|mesmerize me!
{116024}{116099}I'm British!
{116824}{116838}Dia!
{116844}{116875}Dia! Perry!
{117251}{117293}Dia!
{118805}{118848}Dia!
{118905}{118949}Doc!
{119330}{119378}Dia!
{120230}{120277}David!
{120537}{120586}David!
{120798}{120847}Ahh, David!
{121013}{121060}David!
{121126}{121161}Doc,|you're limping!
{121167}{121187}Oh, it's|my brolly!
{121193}{121255}Come on, doc,|hurry up!
{122048}{122078}Come on, doc!
{122084}{122135}Here,|David, here!
{122212}{122240}Come on!
{122246}{122294}Keep going,|doc.
{122402}{122428}Dia.
{122434}{122489}Perry, this way.
{122755}{122797}Wh-why have you stopped?
{122803}{122847}We must|wait for Ra!
{122853}{122879}Oh, yes!
{122885}{122919}Ra!
{122925}{122985}Ra!|It's too late.
{123015}{123053}Come on!
{123363}{123401}Dia.
{123414}{123451}Doc.
{123474}{123509}Doc...
{123515}{123553}Ra!
{124477}{124506}Poor Ra.
{124512}{124538}Yes, indeed.
{124544}{124601}A brave man.
{124816}{124878}Come on, doc.
{125127}{125147}Ah, here's David
{125153}{125204}and his|lovely lady.
{125210}{125266}Good-bye!
{125339}{125393}People of|Pellucidar,
{125404}{125469}according to|your custom,
{125506}{125542}I take
{125548}{125600}Dia
{125617}{125671}to be my bride.
{125813}{125851}No, David.
{125857}{125916}It's not to be.
{125994}{126026}I must stay here.
{126032}{126077}This is my world.
{126092}{126154}I would be lost|in yours.
{126160}{126167}No.
{126173}{126206}No, you wouldn't.|I want to show you
{126212}{126264}the wonders|of my world.
{126270}{126311}I know,
{126317}{126378}and I love you.
{126516}{126542}Come along,|David.
{126548}{126607}We must be|on our way.
{126653}{126706}Good-bye,|Dia.
{126782}{126839}God bless you.
{128185}{128236}David?
I forgot the opening line.
Enough of that, Hobbs.
Flight of birds, the flight of man...
Man's similarity to birds, birds' similarity to man.
These are the subjects at hand.
And we will deal with them for the next hour or so and hope that we draw no conclusions, elsewise, the subject shall cease to fascinate us.
And alas, another dream would be lost.
There are too few.
In these words, the German poet Goethe...
...expressed man's desire to fly.
"How I yearn to throw myself into endless space and float above the awful abyss."
Man, incontestably the most advanced creature, has only to observe the flight of birds to realize the weight of the earth's imprisonment.
And so, the desire to fly has been ever-present in the mind of man.
But the reality has been long in coming.
Has man truly realized his dream?
To answer that, we must isolate the dream.
Was the dream to attain the ability to fly?
Or was the dream the freedom that true flight seemed to offer man?
We may also touch on the mortal damage man is doing
to birds' environment in comparison
to the piddling nuisance birds cause man.
It may someday be necessary
to build enormous environmental enclosures
to protect both man and birds.
But if so, it is questionable
whether man will allow birds in
or out, as the case may be.

Social behavior.
Shelderup Ebb first used the word “dominance," in describing his observations on the social hierarchies of birds.
He concluded that within a flock
composed of a single species,
there exists a definite order of social distinctions.
And that between any two birds,
one invariably has precedence over the other.
All right, it's gonna...

Good morning, Mr. Wright.
Good morning, Birdie.
Get that away from me!
I don't trust your big ears, you dirty pinko.
Here's your money, sir.
- I don't have to count it, do I?
- Oh, no. No, sir.
- It's all here, isn't it, Birdie?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Every last bit.
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.
What is that? Huh?
Yeah! Look at that!
Look at that!
Two big Georges right there!

The investigation continues at this hour
into the mysterious death of well-known Houston socialite
Miss Daphne Heap,
the soprano who sings the national anthem...
...at the Astrodome before every ball game.
Put that window down, McCloud.
McCloud, you don't listen to me.
Now, there are two things
I want to tell you, not only about your driving which is just deplorable, but also about your deportment which is also...
Here's an important bulletin just handed me.
The latest development in that trio of mysterious murders in Houston
came today from the office of Haskell Weeks,
the longtime friend of the city told KILT reporters
that he's bringing in a special investigator
from the San Francisco
Police Department.
A man identified only as Frank Shaft.
Well, kid, that's it.
I'm closing this place down, McCloud.
The black part's a conspiracy, they're moving in.
Did you see that grenade?
There were buckets of grenades in the living room.
That kamikaze...
Get off the grass! McCloud!
Get me off!
McCloud! Oh, McCloud!
Get Spiro on the phone, that's what I'm gonna do right now.
Get me out of here.
Be careful now, McCloud.
Easy! Easy!
Easy, McCloud!
Easy, now!
Up! One by one!
Oh, I just dropped a steamer through the hoop.
This is
Karl Williams, KILT news.
Quarter past the hour now and time for the Hudson & Harrigan
and the cure minute, sir.
How about a rebel yell then...
What may prove to be an important clue
was turned up by police
when it was discovered
Miss Heap's prize pigeons
were apparently released by the killer.
Miss Heap's deep affection for the birds
was well known throughout the southwest.
Yes, everything seems to be in good shape.
I'm very pleasantly surprised, Maybelline.
Wait a minute. Just hold on.
Wait a minute.
Saunders: $24.32.
Unpaid.
Well, he died Tuesday,
Mr. Wright.
- He did?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that, Maybelline.
But if Mr. Saunders did die on Tuesday,
I can't do anything about that.
He still owes me for a week's rent.
That money's gonna have to come from someplace.
What do you plan to do about it?
Well, surely, not from me.
Yes, from you!
What do you mean not from you?
There's money right there in your hands.
- But this...
- I want my money!
- Give me my money!
- This is my money!
Look out!
Where's my bird? No! No!
Something's wrong.
Take your bird.
Get out of here.
It's an invasion!
A goddamn commie invasion!
McCloud, put that window...
Don't you ever do that when I'm talking to you.
What do you mean putting that window up?
Goddamn fag. You know something, McCloud?
You are nothing but a fag.
A goddamn faggot.
Watch this.
Hee, pup pup pup.
Little old gumba, darling, come here.
Didn't anybody ever tell you that you had a beautiful "doreemus."
Ow! Mr. Wright!
You...
Turn on the television set.
The television set's not working.
McCloud, I wanna watch my program.
I gotta watch Sesame Street.
Now turn it on.
Look! McCloud, on the hood!
Bird doodoo! Bird doodoo!
Stop the car, McCloud!
Stop the car!
Get that thing off of there.
Get it off!
Hurry up, McCloud!
Hurry up!
Wipe it off!
It'll run right through the paint.
Bird shit on the hood,
God damn it.
I should never have hired you this morning.
Goddamn birds.
McCloud, are you happy in your work?
Well, you must think I have all the money in the world!
You're fired!
I don't give a damn!
Don't tell me... get away from me.
- Get out of my way!
- Please!
Get out of my way, you silly bitch.
I'll mow you down!
You yap, yap, yap!
You're so full of bullshit...
How do you do, ladies?
All right, McCloud, let's move it.
Easy down the chute, McCloud.
Easy down.
McCloud?
McCloud! McCloud!
Don't you ever lay a hand on my money.
Ah... my money...
McCloud...
KILT news learned
that Shaft is being flown into Houston
entirely at Haskell Weeks' expense.
The legendary super-cop from 'Frisco is due to arrive
at Houston
Intercontinental Airport
only minutes from now.
And we'll have a reporter there for on-the-scene coverage.
♪ Last thing you do is hear the jingle in your pocket ♪
♪ When they sock it to you further down the line ♪
♪ And all that funny money ♪
♪ It won't get you milk and honey ♪
♪ So ride ride ride
Abraham, ride... ♪
Oh, do you have the number of the local Audubon Society?
Luke McIntyre at
Houston's Intercontinental Airport.
We are stationed in the private and very exclusive
executive jet terminal
where Haskell Weeks' personal jet Silver Eagle Mark IV
has arrived non-stop from the west coast
with one of California's most famous detectives on board,
San Francisco super-cop
Frank Shaft.
And our sources tell us
Shaft is here to work
on the recent rash of mysterious strangulation murders.
Ah.
The crested peacock.
On the peacock, it is just that nature appears to have bestowed her treasures with the greatest profusion.
Its size, imposing manner,
firm tread and noble figure,
the rich crest upon its head,
its matchless plumage
appearing to combine
everything that can delight the eye.
And contend to place it in our high esteem.
Here's Shaft now disembarking.
He's a striking figure.
Turtleneck sweater, custom slacks,
and I can tell you this.
If keeping your cool and being totally composed
makes for a better detective,
then this Shaft is one whale of a cop.
I hate to rush you, Lieutenant, but Captain Crandall is gonna get really pissed off at me.
I mean, I was supposed to take you right over to his office as soon as you came in.
I don't know how it is in San Francisco, sir, but here in Houston, Captain
Crandall is head of homicide.
And he rules that department with an iron fist and what he says really goes, sir.
I don't even think he likes San Francisco, sir.
Frank.
Tell me about the third one, Johnson.
That woman who was strangled.
- Frank?
- That's my name. Call me Frank, ok?
Yes, sir.
Do you mind if I use that phone to call Captain Crandall?
- Tell him where we...
- Tell me about that third one, Johnson.
Ok.
Her name was Daphne Heap, sir.
And she was very well respected and admired in town.
Her father was a great benefactor, gave us a couple hospitals.
And a nice park.
Well, she was quite a character, sir.
You know, she used to sing the national anthem at all the ball games.
You know the type, sir?
Even had her own orchestra and everything.
The unmated Song Thrush.
The importance of song to a bird
can be partly judged by the amount of time
the bird devotes to it.
However,
one can, with almost equally good logic,
assume that bird chorales
were first used to release the nervous tension...
Get out, you nigger bird!
It was a mess, sir.
You should've seen her.
- Molested?
- Molested?
Sexually.
Was she sexually assaulted?
Oh, no.
But she sure was a mess, sir.
Miss Heap was found strangled
at the formal palatial in River Oaks.
She was sprawled among the bird of paradise plants
dressed in a red, white and blue acrylic knit
with flattering wing collar
and matching imitating bird feather belt
and those spangling red rhinestone shoes.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Astrodome, the eighth wonder of the world.
My name is Suzanne Ferris and I'll be your tour guide for the next 45 minutes to an hour.
So please feel free to ask questions at any time.
And if you must leave, like to go to the bathroom or something, please notify me.
By the way, where is the bathroom?
Where is the bathroom?
Well, there are bathrooms every 50 feet.
But they're not really bathrooms, you know.
They're... they don't have a tub or anything like that.
All right, our first stop will be down in the Dome Skeller.
It's 25 feet underground.
And it's about the only place you can go
that far underground in Texas and not strike oil.
The Cassowary...
the body of the Cassowary is extremely heavy
and its wings are so short
that it has no power to raise itself
from the ground in flight.
A bony protuberance
forms on the top of the head.
A sort of... helmet.
Like the ostrich, this bird is not very delicate in its taste.
All right, if you'll just please follow me,
we'll be going down there right now.
Oh, sir, do you have change for this... this half a dollar?
Jesus Christ, how do you sleep around here?
Well, you get used to that after a while.
It's usually the heart guys that cause it.
What guys?
We got a couple doctors here who do transplants.
They'll sit around and wait till a stiff dies the right way.
For his heart, you know?
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me. You can get drinks and things later.
Please stay with the tour.
I'm sure you'll really like it up here.
Y'all will get to hear something too.
Like the scoreboard, even though it's so big, it's just operated by this small room that has a really complicated computer inside of it.
I mean, the other day talked to a man...
And they turned out some pretty interesting stuff.
But just think if somebody really intelligent got hold of it, what they could do.
I mean, it could probably work out some problems.
Oh, look, it's Officer Ledbetter here.
He just likes my tour a lot, I guess.
And as you heard in our interview,
Frank Shaft apparently is in Houston at the expense
at the expense of Haskell Weeks
to lend assistance
to local police in their investigation
of these unusual strangulation murders.
Captain Crandall's gonna be awful angry when he finds out how long we're taking.
Look, Johnson... it is Johnson, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Frank.
I mean Frank.
Now, we're gonna be working together, right?
Yes, sir.
Uh, Frank.
Ok, I want to tell you something about me.
I don't much care how pissed off any desk cop gets. Got it?
It's working stiffs like us that get the job done.
Now, I want to go over to where that last guy lived.
Abraham Wright, wasn't that his name?
Yes, Frank, sir.
Ok, we're gonna go over there and look around, Johnson.
Just you and me.
The partridge...
The affection of partridges
for their offspring is peculiarly interesting.
They lead them out to feed,
the point out to them the proper places for their food
and assist them in finding it by scratching the ground
with their feet.
They frequently sit close together,
covering the young ones with their wings,
and from this protection,
they are not easily roused.
Watch out for these big steps because we wouldn't want anyone to trip and sue the dome or anything.
There's a lot more to see, so everybody better hurry
'cause you're gonna walk nine miles today.
And when we get down there, there's also a weather station.
It cost a third of a million dollars.
Ok, everybody, stop here.
We've got to wait for those laggers.
Last time, we had ten people get lost...
Ok, Johnson, let's go.
Telephone, sir.
It might be Captain Crandall wanting to know where we are.
His facial expression never changes.
His eyes are extraordinary.
They're the most piercing blue
I've ever seen.
Now, there's a killer loose in the city, Johnson.
Are we gonna get him or are we gonna go downtown and play politics?
- Hi.
- Hi. May I help you?
I'm interested in a camera that would allow me to do some extremely detailed work.
Sure. Sure.
- Show him the Nikon, Gary.
- This one?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Gary, remove the lens cap.
Oh. Would there be a way of hanging it around my neck?
Grab us a neck strap, Gary.
There you go.
Yeah.
Now, what does something like that run?
Price for this is, uh...
You'll have to look it up in the book, Gary.
- Excuse me...
- Gary.
My throat is killing me.
Do you have any aspirin?
- Aspirin?
- I'll get some throat lozenges.
- You look up the price.
- Ok.
Thank you.
You have such a lovely smile.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
You have a nice smile yourself.
You must be a very happy person.
Well, I try to make the best of things.
Excuse me for a minute.
Is there a manager around here that I could talk to?
Right back there.
Uh, is there anything
I can help you with?
Well, yes.
Actually, I was thinking of taking this trip, and I was thinking of taking some snapshots.
Right, that's a good idea.
What kind of camera do you have?
Actually, that's it.
You see, I don't have a camera.
You don't have a camera?
Pardon me.
- What?
- Would you be interested in...
- If you've got a minute.
- Just a minute, will you?
Is there a difference?
Yeah. I'll show you.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute if I could.
Yeah, well, what about?
Well, I've got a...
Just a minute, lady.
Who, me?
Let me see your receipt.
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't buy anything.
Well, would you mind showing me what's in your bag?
Oh, surely.
Uh, shampoo.
- Mm-hmm.
- Shampoo.
Shampoo.
I always buy three bottles at a time.
Not that it's any cheaper, but it saves me a trip.
My hair's so oily, I have to wash it every other day.
Well, you've got beautiful hair.
Yeah, what else is in the bag?
Oh, my brush, Kleenex, crossword puzzle book.
And Band-Aids, cologne.
Mouthwash.
- More shampoo.
- Yeah.
Not one of them lasted more than one day.
Every Saturday, poor old Mr. Wright used to make his rounds,
Every Saturday, there was a new driver.
I interviewed them.
I ought to know.
Can you describe him?
Down to the mole on the back of his neck.
He had a mole on his neck?
No! That's just a figure of speech.
You know, like saying something is faster than greased lightning?
Yeah, I know. I know.
How tall was he?
Oh, short. Very short.
Like you.
I'm six-one, Millhouse.
You are? I'm five-nine, and you look shorter than me.
You're standing on the steps.
Oh. So I am.
All right, where were you when you interviewed him?
Here, right here where we are.
You were up there and he was down here?
- Is that right?
- I think so.
I'd so those steps are about eight inches.
So, that means that if he was six-foot-one, he would have looked to you to be 16 inches shorter.
About four-nine.
Right. Under five feet.
Short. Only I think
I was down here.
And... and he was there.
Well, what the hell would he be doing up here?
Well, he was short, like I said.
And it made him feel better.
All right, he was up here and you were down there.
- Is that right?
- Right.
And he looked to you to be about four-foot-nine?
That's right. Short.
Jesus Christ, Millhouse, if he was four-foot-nine, and he was standing on 16 inches of steps, that'd make him only three-foot-five.
That's right, he was short. Like you.
There could be no more shocking statement
than to say the closest living relatives
to men are houseflies or that the butterfly
evolved from a rhinoceros.
But is there any real proof?
Can evolution really prove birds came from reptiles?
Birds are amazing creatures,
fantastically designed,
each for a different specific purpose.
What's the matter, honey?
Your leg hurt?
God damn it!
Does yours?
Now, here. Hold this.
Come on, Douglas. Stanford wants to see the monkeys.
You shut up! I'll go when
I'm damn good and ready.
You hear?
Don't you want to see the monkeys, Douglas?
If I want to see some monkeys,
I'll go over to nigger town.
Where do you suppose that punk kid got a camera like that?
Douglas, Stanford wants to see the monkeys. Come on...
Listen here! You want that pansy son of yours to see some monkeys?
He's your son too!
You'll never convince me that pasty-face pansy came out of Douglas B. Breen.
Now, take him to the car!
And wait till I get there before I give you something you wish you hadn't got.
The Brazilian Green Macaw...
...is as beautiful as it is rare.
It soon becomes familiar with persons whom it sees frequently.
But it has an aversion to strangers and sometimes
attacks them with great fury.
Hey, that's a nice looking camera you got there.
Jap camera, ain't it?
- Yeah, a Nikon.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
Hey, you hear what the Jap girl said when she took off her brassiere?
How'd you like to nip on these?
You get it?
“Nip on these," you know. Tits... nip.
Hey, that must have set you back a pretty penny.
No, this was a present from my grandfather.
Ah, what's your grandfather?
Some Jew millionaire?
He's, uh... he's a ship's carpenter in the Merchant Marines.
So every time he goes to Japan, he brings me back something like a lens or a tripod.
Parental behavior when an intruder disturbs or endangers
the nest or young,
some birds slip away quietly and unobtrusively.
Some may attack the intruder.
- Take it easy.
- Get over there!
You know what that is?
A poorly rolled cigarette.
It's a marijuana cigarette.
It's dope!
It's dope I picked up after I saw you drop it out of your pocket.
You give me that camera and we'll forget this little matter.
If you don't, it's one to ten.
So take your pick, kid.
Mister, one of us is crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Breen. Narcotics.
Being a murderer's bad enough, but a thief on top of it?
What do you mean, a thief?
He took one of Mr. Wright's books.
- Lieutenant!
- Wait a minute, Johnson.
What do you mean he took one of Mr. Wright's books?
He came here for a book.
He said Mr. Wright sent him for it.
And little did I know that the poor old man was dead.
- Frank...
- Which book did he take?
This one right here, where this empty space is.
- I hate to interrupt...
- What is it?
Well, there's been another one over at the zoo.
- Strangling?
- Yes, sir. Uh, Frank.
Jesus Christ.
What was the name of the book?
I don't know the name of the book.
It was given to Mr. Wright by his two brothers a long time ago.
Man's first successful powered flight,
on windswept sand dunes near Kitty Hawk,
five men and a boy witnessed the first successful flight
of an engine driven heavier than air flying machine.
But it was hardly a bird.
About what?
About three-inch diameter?
It doesn't look like he's got any holes anywhere here.
Is he a friend of yours,
Johnson, this Officer Breen?
No, he's in narcotics.
I'm in traffic.
No, the only narcotics man I ever met was my wife's cousin Benny.
He got busted for trafficking.
It's kind of funny.
Isn't it? I mean, he gets busted for trafficking and I'm in traffic.
Hey, do you suppose that the strangler was a hophead?
A what?
You know, a dope addict.
I don't know, Johnson.
- Captain Crandall?
- Yeah, Hanes.
Hines.
- Yeah.
- I just found this over here.
What the hell is it?
I believe it's marijuana.
You think so?
I'll check that.
Mrs. Green, would you and the kid get out of here for about a minute?
Yeah.
Matt, what about this?
Is that marijuana?
Well, there's no way, uh...
What do you think?
There's only one way to tell.
- Send it to the lab.
- Oh.
Well, we're nearly there, Lieutenant.
I mean Frank.
All right, pull over here.
- What?
- Pull over right here.
- Here?
- Pull over. Park.
Ok, Johnson, let's go.
There's no point in them knowing we're friends.
And how about his head?
Where in the hell's he been, Johnson?
This is Captain Crandall.
Frank Shaft, San Francisco.
How long's he been dead?
Your plane got in three and a half hours ago.
What I'd like to know is where in the hell have you been?
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I'm Haskell Weeks.
Frank Shaft.
Welcome to Houston,
Lieutenant Shaft.
And allow me to apologize for Captain Crandall, here.
He's a good police officer, but I'm afraid he has not, as yet, mastered the simple art of common courtesy, have you, captain?
What the hell are you doing?
I told you fellas to keep over there behind the line!
Bullshit.
I'll convey your sentiments to the governor.
The governor and I are very close.
This the way he was found, Captain?
Captain, aren't you going to answer the lieutenant?
Look, I'm in charge of this case, Weeks.
If you want this California hot shot to work on it, he'll work my way.
You understand?
Of course that's the way he was found.
What do you think we are, stupid?
- Was he on a case?
- I don't know.
I'm in traffic.
Was he on a case?
- Hanes?
- Hines.
- Was he in a case?
- No, sir.
Everybody's on the case whether off duty or on.
Texas is a big state, Lieutenant.
And there are still some of us here who don't realize...
Can't you get that turtle out of here?
- This his camera?
- Yeah, the film's been taken out.
He probably spotted the killer, followed him and was making some pictures, you know?
Fingerprints?
Yeah, I think we'll be able to get some good ones from that.
Ok, well, let's make sure everything's covered before we release it to his family.
What about them?
Huh?
Who's gonna tell his wife and kid?
Ah, I don't know.
What's this stuff on his eye?
That's, uh...
It's bird...
It's... you know...
Bird shit.
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't you cover him up?
That happened before.
It was there when we found him.
They all had it on 'em.
All of 'em?
Every one.
It's the time of year.
- You know my car's completely ruined?
- Shit.
If you have any problem in our city, Lieutenant, feel free to call on me.
And if you get a spare moment, we'll have a cocktail together.
I'm an old friend of your mayor's.
Are you through yet, Shaft?
I want to know what kind of bird it was.
God almighty.
Let's go, Norwood.
Wing muscles.
Approximately
50 different wing muscles...
...and muscle slips have been described as affecting the wing...
Brewster!
It's me. Hope.
Hi, Brewster.
I've been living on graham crackers for a week.
- I got your stuff.
- And my peanut butter?
Uh-huh. I almost got caught stealing the rose hips.
Thank you.
Brewster, what's the difference between rose hips and regular vitamin C?
They're organic.
What does "organic" mean?
Hope, you're the one who works in the health food store,
You're the one who's supposed to know that.
Mrs. Parker never tells me anything.
She just yells at me.
Date nut bread?
Yeah, do me a favor, put 'em on the table.
I gotta finish my exercises.
I got you coconut pecan cookies with raw sugar and unbleached flour and...
We're all right.
And, um... chocolate covered raisins for energy.
Wow, Brewster.
You're really in great shape.
How many of those can you do?
Hundreds.
Oh, wow.
I gotta do 'em.
I brought my own lunch, too.
Hot dog.
Brewster?
Tell me again what you're doing here.
What do you think I'm doing?
I know you're doing chin-ups, but I mean, what's the rest of it about?
I'm building my wings.
You're making an airplane?
No.
What are you doing?
I'm flying away.
Where are you flying to?
Away.
Wow.
Brewster...
Do you ever think about anything except flying?
Sure.
You think about girls?
Brewster?
Yeah, all the time.
Oh, wow.
What are you up to?
- Huh?
Brewster!
Are you thinking about me or are you thinking about flying?
Oh! Oh, Brewster!
What are you up to?
Tell me! Please!
What are you up to?
Huh? What are you up to?
Wow.
Wow!
What?! Oh, what?!
Wow, Brewster.
You're really something.
The... the Jackdaw is easily trained and made with little difficulty to be taught to pronounce several words.
Now, listen, tonight...
Listen. I'm gonna take you over there, right?
- Marty, don't answer it.
- You know I have to, Angie.
Hello.
Johnson, this is Frank Shaft.
How do you do,
Lieutenant Shaft? Uh, Frank.
I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I?
Hmm? Oh, uh...
No, I... finished about an hour ago.
Good.
Listen, I want you to take these bird shit samples over to the lab.
Right now, sir?
Uh, Frank?
I'd do it myself but I'm busy right now.
I need somebody
I can trust on this.
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm, uh... right out the door now.
Johnson, you're a good cop.
Near the sky box, also the presidential suite, is the white area over there to the right of the Texico sign.
That's where President Johnson views the game from when he's here at the stadium.
And if President Nixon ever attends, he'll watch the game from that box.
But after baseball season...
Hi, Louise.
Hi, Brewster.
That girl was here.
Hope? Yep.
I got a whole new thing of health food.
I did 300 today.
Nothing goes on between you two, does it?
Me and Hope?
She seems so passionate.
I really didn't notice.
You ever think about that sort of thing?
What?
Girls. You know.
Sex?
Hey, Louise, I think you've been talking to Hope.
She just asked me the same exact thing.
All right, Brewster.
Time to relax.
Come on, we have to stay on schedule.
Why do you always ask me about Hope?
Because she's passionate and she can involve you.
Involve me?
In what?
Sex.
Is Hope really like that?
People like Hope accept what's been told to them.
They don't think they can be free.
They don't even believe they can be free.
Their sex is the closest thing they have to...
Flying.
Yes. Flying.
Don't they want to fly?
Only at first.
Something happens to them as they grow.
And they...
They turn more and more toward earth.
When they experience sex, they simply settle for it.
And procreate more of their own kind.
So you must never be tempted, let anything take your full concentration away from your work.
I don't think I could do it without your help.
I'll always be here to help you, Brewster.
I'll be with you until you can fly away.

Instead of a prayer at this time, the widow, Mrs. Green, has requested I read instead the departed's favorite poem, words be glad to live by.
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways
I love thee to the breadth and depth and height of my soul...
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways
I love thee to the breadth and depth and height my soul can reach..."
I can't put into words how I personally feel about this brave officer who died so nobly.
Bullshit.
Speaking for myself and my entire staff.
Save it, Weeks.
Green was a bad cop, and that camera was hot for Christ's sake.
He was a thief as well as a shake-down artist.
May I remind you that he died in the line of duty.
Shit, he was on vacation.
"In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith
I love thee with..."
I'm having a few friends over for dinner this evening, Lieutenant,
I thought you might like to join us.
I'll be busy.
I might remind you that my friends are not without influence.
Good, then they won't miss me, will they?
Protective plumage...
prolonged rains are destructive to bird life
because the insulating value of plumage deteriorates as it becomes wet.
Bye!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you trying to steal my car?
What?
I asked you if you were trying to steal my car.
Is this your car?
It looks exactly like my car.
Uh, you even have the little statue in front like mine.
That's the Virgin Mary.
They used to be real popular a long time ago.
This is a very weird... there aren't too many orange and black cars around, you know.
Uh, I apologize. I didn't...
Hey, I don't mind you trying to steal my car.
And besides it was raining and everything.
You don't wanna catch a cold, do you?
No.
You look like the type that catches cold pretty easily.
I'll take you where you're gonna go.
Uh, I would like to pick up a few photos that I'm having printed.
Pictures?
I love pictures.
Are they in color?
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
You're the chauffeur.
McCloud, are you happy here working?
Courtship is ordinarily the province of the male, and he shows his wares before the female with an astonishing assortment of tricks
of varying according to the species.
He may posture
so as to reveal his gaudiest nuptial plumage.
Spread his tail and erect his crest
or inflate brilliantly colored pouches
and parade, dance, fly with dizzying acrobatics.
Sing his most fetching love song.
You were on the tour, weren't you?
Tour?
Yeah, I liked it.
You kept ducking out all the time. Did I bore you?
I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, diarrhea. That's tough.
Hope it wasn't from eating
Mexican food. That's bad.
But that's when I usually get it.
Have you ever had diarrhea from eating Mexican food before?
I like your car.
It's not mine, really.
I met this guy at the racetrack.
Automobile races.
You know, stock cars, midgets.
Anyway, I'm a race car driver.
I don't have a car or anything, but sometimes some of the guys let me drive for them.
Anyway, one night this guy offered to take me home.
So I said ok.
Well, instead of taking me home, he took me to Memorial Park.
I mean, wow, he tried to rape me.
Anyway, I hit him with a lug wrench and drove home.
I haven't seen him since so I've got this neat little Roadrunner.
How long ago was that?
A couple of weeks.
Does he know where you live?
No, maybe that's why he never came to pick it up.
And it's really sort of a neat little car.
It's all souped up and everything. See?
"I love thee freely, as men strive for right
I love thee purely, as men turns from praise
I love thee with passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my...“
- Hey!
- What?
Come on, for God's sake.
"I love thee with a love
I seemed to lose with my lost saints
I love thee with..."
“I choose to love thee better every day"
Oh, God.
That's fantastic.
That'll be $468.50, sir.
Uh, yeah, you charge that for me, will ya?
Oh, those are the biggest snapshots I ever seen.
Yeah.
They sure are pretty, though.
What are they?
These are studies of the yutaxican diasteraxic arrangements of the major covetan secondaries of the phoenicopteridae.
Oh, I thought maybe they were pictures of your mother and father at the beach.
No, these are photos that I took at the zoo of various birds.
I was just joking, Brewster.
Huh?
I tell you what, I got this great dinner planned tonight at my house, so how'd you like to come over?
Oh, fine. Fine.
- Uh-huh.
- What is it?
Uric acids, amino acids.
Formers of glucose, traces of saturated almond.
Whoops!
It's bird shit, for Christ's sake.
We all know that.
Is this how you got your rep, Sheriff, running around collecting shit samples?
What kind of a bird did it come from?
Well, we couldn't tell you that.
Tell you what it ate, but I don't think we can determine what kind of bird it came from.
Besides, it might not have been a bird.
I know bird shit when I see it.
Now, I suggest we drop this bird shit shit and settle down to some old-fashioned police work.
You go ahead and do your old-fashioned police work, Captain, and leave me alone to work in my own way.
This is my department, Sheriff.
I was under the impression that I could handle this case my way, is that true or what?
We don't have to draw such fine lines, gentlemen, we're all after the same thing.
Not necessarily.
I doubt it even come from a bird.
I'll just assume I did not hear that.
What else could've done it?
A snake, toad maybe.
Maybe even one of those turtles.
Christ, I've heard of everything. Turtle shit.
We could've told more if you hadn't of broken the geometric composition, you know?
Besides this is only a small portion. It's not a full sample.
Lieutenant, perhaps you'd like to reconsider my invitation for dinner.
I tell ya, maybe a scatologist could help.
What's a scatologist?
There will be some people there who can be very useful to one's career.
You know, shit.
Can you get us one?
There's a guy over at the University of
Houston who's supposed to be pretty good.
Should we say nine o' clock, then?
I really don't have time for this small talk, Mr. Weeks.
I hope you're not being hostile, Lieutenant.
May I remind you that it was I who brought you in on this case.
There's a message here for you.
Read it. Read it. Go on.
Well, there's something confidential about it.
There's nothing confidential in the police department. Read it, Hanes.
"Hines."
Your mother says that when you pick up the olive oil, you should also get some romaine.
Pollution. Of greater importance than ever before
is the bird's adaptation to the new conditions.
Since man, his traps, his guns and his pollution...
...have come upon the scene,
upsetting all the order of nature and slowly,
surely, claiming the whole earth for himself
and his own destruction.
Hi, nice to see you.
There's still no guarantee that that film came from Green's camera.
But all the pictures were taken at the zoo.
What the hell does that mean?
Everybody takes pictures at the goddamn zoo.
They think they got a picture.
They got in these cameras.
Never mind this, where's Hanes?
- “Hines."
- Where is Shaft?
He's in the back in the lab.
- Wendell?
- What is it?
How you doing?
I'm putting it in the soup now.
We got a lot of important fuzz out here.
You call us when we can see that thing.
- Well?
- It's in the soup now.
I started racing 'cause of this guy I was in love with.
His name was Bernard and he was a really neat artist.
He used to do etchings on cider bottles.
Boy, was he a genius.
He was beautiful, too.
He had hair out to here.
But his daddy was rich and made him cut his hair and then go into politics.
Evidently he didn't get too far though 'cause he's only a secretary.
Anyway, the whole deal made me so mad, I broke every one of his cider bottles.
Especially the one he dedicated to me.
When is the goddamn picture going to be ready?
Wendel's working on the negatives right now.
Color lab?
I'll see. Is there a
Lieutenant Shaft here?
This your bourbon?
Haskell Weeks here, Lieutenant.
I understand you might have a lead.
The lab had an electronic surveillance camera.
We'll have the film in a few minutes.
Why don't you come sit over here with me?
No, I gotta be going now,
I think.
Brewster, here I am sitting over here on the couch, and inviting you to do, well, who knows what?
And you just sit there and say,
"Oh, no, I've gotta go home."
Yeah, I do gotta go home, though.
I think I'll have a little of that.
Don't you get it?
You're in traffic and...
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was the ladies' room.
- What?
- What the hell is that?
Do you think you can get a decent description of the man who brought it in?
Well, Lieutenant, why don't you drop over here for an after-dinner drink?
There's someone here who'd very much like to meet you.
It's not my fault this time.
The red light was on, and the door's supposed to be closed when the red light is on.
That's the rule.
Thanks!
Christ.
Well, is he coming?
I'm afraid not, Senator.
He's a very dedicated man.
What about them ballplayers?
Curfew, Senator. They have a very strict... curfew.
Astronauts? Does he know any astronauts?
Weeks!
Aren't you going to kiss me?
I don't know how.
Brewster, are you a virgin?
Am I a virgin?
I bet you live with your mother, don't you?
No, I live by myself.
- Where?
- By the Dome, in a room.
I gotta get going. It'll take me a while to get back.
Oh, look, take my car.
I can get a ride with Nicki.
She works at the Dome, too.
You can meet me there at 4:00, and I'll get my car then.
How's that for a good plan?
Ok.
That way I'll get to see you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
Don't forget 4:00.
Hey, boy!
Where the hell you think you're going with that car?
Pardon me?
"Pardon me," my ass.
That car belongs to Billy Joe
Goodwill, and that happens to be me.
And I've been chasing you down for a long time.
I think you've made an error.
There's been a goddamn error made, all right.
But you and that dingy girlfriend of yours are the one that made the error.
And now I'm fixed to strum your head, and when I get through with you,
I'm gonna go up to...
What do you have on this guy, Harry?
Well, his name was Billy Joe Goodwill.
Goodwill?
There seems to be some connection with racecar drivers.
Can you tell me when the guy died? Can you find that out?
The Widow Green got the full pension.
To hell with the Widow Green, we got another murder on our hands.
Say, are you with the lab?
He's got a very good reputation.
What kind of reputation?
The Santa Barbara Strangler surrendered to him.
The Santa Barbara Strangler... surrendered himself.
He surrendered himself, see?
He must have trusted him.
It's a goddamn waste of time, you ask me.
It could yield a clue.
I know it seems far-fetched.
What sort of clue are we going to get from bird shit?
- Well, you can't...
- What happened? Is anybody hurt?
No, everything's all right, young lady.
We're just having a drill for the ambulance drivers.
They need a little training, you know?
You run along.
We take care of things.
- Oh,
- Jesus Christ.
Hey, Brewster.
Right on time! Wow!
Where you going?
I wanna be by myself.
I need some time to think.
Why don't you come with me?
Nah, I think I'll take a walk.
Yeah, I'd really like to go with you.
Ok.
Dammit.
Come on, right now.
This sample here is the excrement that we took off Officer Green's body while the second one here is the sample we took off the last victim, Mr. Goodwill.
I think that we can definitely say that these two samples came from the same bird.
You sure it was a bird?
It wasn't no flying turtle, was it?
Sarcasm so early in the day,
Captain?
Yes, we can definitely say it was a bird.
What kind of bird?
Well, we can't really say about that, but we can be sure that it was from a small bird.
Perhaps a pigeon or a small pheasant or perhaps a... perhaps a raven.
Well, the guy's a bird freak.
It's probably a pet.
Yeah? Yeah?
Well, you just look for some kook with a bird on his shoulder.
We'll be running down a
1970 orange Roadrunner...
It's mango.
..."orange" Roadrunner, license plate number...
D-U-V-2-2-2.
I want a pickup on that car, and it's dangerous.
Who might that be, Captain?
Goodwill's car, it's missing.
Yeah.
The killer probably has it, but he won't keep it for long so let's get going, Hanes.
- "Hines."
- Watch it there.
Perhaps Captain Crandall is right.
Perhaps you should not have been brought in on the case at all, Lieu... Lieutenant.
I'd like to go on record right now.
I do not... admire a man who uses others as a stepping stone to gain his own ends.
What is this?
Come on, Brewster, you're going to love it.
Calling all cars, calling all cars.
Be on the lookout for a 1970 mango-orange Roadrunner,
license number D-U-V-2-2-2.
Approach with caution, y'all, occupant is considered dangerous.
That is all.
All right, Johnson, here it is:
Take Memorial to West Loop
South, take West Loop South to South Beach.
I'll ride 59 to Post Oak Road and
I'll meet you on West Loop South.
Now, if you see him, don't get heroic.
Just hang back and call me.
We don't know what he'll do if he sees a squad car.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.
- Frank.
- I mean Frank.
Ok, let's go, Johnson.
Welcome aboard, crew, my name's Gina, and I'm gonna be your guide right now.
Are there any people on board from out of state, out of town or foreigners?
Yes, sir, where are you from?
- Mississippi.
- Mississippi.
- Well, how's Mr. Sippi?
- Fine.
Fine, well, good.
Among forms of behavior which show great stereotypes
are those that have to do with care of the body surface.
To bathe in water, most species immerse the head, suddenly raise it
and then begin beating the wing.
Look up there to your right, there's our famous god, Boomba.
Every time I think of all the years you've spent with that monster,
I just start shaking.
You didn't deserve that.
I mean, he was a monster.
That was all he was.
You deserve the best. Not to say that I'm the best.
Now, we're entering to the land of the Shirley Indian tribe.
See that temple they built?
Well, you'll never guess what we call it, the Shirley Temple.
And you know, we're thinking of painting that Shirley Temple black.
Say, Rob, you haven't seen a Roadrunner around here with a racing-type setup, have you?
Uh, no. Is something wrong?
Oh, great, another parking ticket.
I don't even know why. They're a waste of paper.
Think we got a line on the Strangler.
Yeah, license number
D-U-V-2-2-2.
Why, I just gave them...
Ho!
Frank. to mobile unit 710.
2-3-12 to mobile unit 710.
Over.
Yeah, what is it, Johnson?
I've got him, sir... Frank.
D-U-V-2-2-2, right in front of me.
Jesus Christ, Johnson,
I told you to call me.
You were just supposed to spot him and call me.
Well, that's all I've done, sir. I spotted them, they haven't spotted me.
Look, they're right in front of me.
They don't even know
I'm behind them.
I'm incognito. I don't have my light on or anything.
Where?
I'm on the south loop going west, so if you take the Old Spanish Trail going east, you can head them off.
Ok, keep in sight of a save act.
When you see me, call.
2-3-12 clear.
Clear.
2-3-12 to mobile unit 710.
Yep?
I'm at a stoplight one block south from Old Spanish Trail, over.
Ok, Jonathan, I see you.
Jesus Christ.
I've got them, Frank.
You all right, Mother, it's not too hot for you?
You wanna look this way?
You wanna look right at me?
- That's great.
- That's where I'm looking.
Ok, wanna hold it.
Can I ask you to switch places here?
Could you... That's great.
Should I be standing next to Hines?
Yeah.
Ok. Hold it, don't move.
Ah!
Police business, ma'am.
Would you follow that car?
Follow that car?
I'd love to.
Are you all right?
My legs are crushed.
I'm trapped in here.
I'll get some help.
That won't be necessary.
Brewster!
Brewster! Brewster!
Brewster! Ham and buckwheat honey!
Whoo!
Brewster, I'm watching the ball game.
Oh, oh, Brewster!
Come over to the...
Brewster.
Oh, let's count.
One, two, three, four!
Oh, Brewster, I can't hear you.
Come on!
Brewster, they were bind!
One, two... Come on!
Brewster?
It's hot in here.
Aren't you going to take off your coat?
Boy, am I sweating.
That was some race, huh?
Those cops really hung in there.
Brewster, I can't hear you!
I can't hear you!
Come on, Brewster, we were dying!
I meant to get you buckwheat honey, but I made a mistake and got you coconut banana.
That was your first time, wasn't it?
Mm-hmm.
That means that I'm responsible for you from now on.
When will I get to see you again?
Always, forever.
I guess you'll just have to fly away with me.
I'm scared of aeroplanes.
Last time I flew to Dallas,
I got so scared,
I soiled right through my new dress.
I can kinda fly.
Real flying.
I have wings... like a bird.
Wings?
You're kidding.
Mm.
Uh-uh.
I've been working on them for a long time.
They're almost finished.
You mean you've got real wings that work?
And that you can really fly with?
Mm-hmm.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Where are they?
Where I live in the Dome.
You live in the Astrodome?
You're kidding. Where?
In the fallout shelter.
And you've got wings that really work?
Mm-hmm.
You're kidding.
You keep saying that. Do you think I'd just make that up?
When can you try them out?
Tomorrow. I can fly tomorrow?
I waited up for you.
It's very late.
You should be in bed.
I'm not tired.
That girl almost got you caught.
I asked you not to see her again.
I think I'm capable of picking my own friends.
You only have one friend,
Brewster, me.
I'm the only one who cares about you.
Why did you lie to me?
I never lied to you.
I'm the only one who has never lied to you.
It's happened, hasn't it?
It's not like you would say it would be at all, Louise.
Suzanne is nothing like you said.
Brewster do you realize what that means if they work?
Yeah.
We can fly away together.
"Fly away."
Brewster, you could be a millionaire.
I've got to get you a good lawyer to protect you.
And you'll need a patent.
Bernard'll know. Remember he's my old boyfriend.
The one I told you about who works for the politician.
You could get a limousine with a chauffeur and everything.
Suzanne, you're talking crazy.
You can get a house on
River Oaks Boulevard.
Brewster, how could you?
Louise, if Suzanne upsets you that much, maybe you better go.
You told her everything about yourself, didn't you?
But we have to fly away.
Why? Why can't we stay here?
This is my home.
I love it here.
They'll put me in a cage.
Why?
You know all the people who died?
You mean the ones who were strangled?
Mm-hmm.
I'm responsible.
She's coming here, isn't she?
Don't you know what she'll do?
She'll be the death of you.
We could leave now.
We could leave now.
All right, we'll go now.
But it'll take me a little time to get ready.
So why don't you go ahead and go to the
Dome and begin getting the wings ready.
And I'll meet you there in the fallout shelter.
Right?
- Suzanne?
- Huh?
I love you, and Louise was wrong.

Hello?
May I speak to Bernard?
Who?
Bernard. He's supposed to work there.
I think he's a secretary or something.
Just a moment.
It's for you.
Bernard, you know I do not approve of your taking personal phone calls during business hours.
Well, who is it?
I hope it's an emergency.
Hello?
Bernard, it's me, Suzanne.
Suzanne, Mr. Weeks doesn't like me getting personal calls at work.
But it's an emergency.
It's an emergency.
I've been dating this really weird boy.
His name is Brewster...
Brewster McCloud.
Bernard, I think he's crazy.
He thinks he can fly, and I think he's the one who's been strangling all those people.
You mean you know who the strangler is?
Give me that phone.
Young lady?
This is Haskell Weeks.
What?
Can't close this goddamned door.
And you say he says he can fly,
Miss Ferris?
Yeah, that's what he said.
He said he's got wings he made himself.
He probably swoops down on people and strangles them.
Mm-hmm.
It looks like he's deranged also.
Suzanne is very gullible,
Mr. Weeks.
And yet he did confess to the stranglings, however.
Yes! You don't know how it scared me being here with a crazy person.
Shall I call the police,
Mr. Weeks?
No.
No, we shall... shall not call the police.
I am going to bring in this confessed killer myself.
When I have him safely in my custody, and I've had a chance to consider all the political options of that move, then we'll notify the police.
Are you about ready, Miss, uh...
All ready.
Hi, Bernard.
The blue footed booby will compete for the attentions of her intended
by goose stepping in front of him,
raising her bright blue feet as high as she can
and thrusting out her chest.
- Wait in the car, Bernard.
- But don't you want me to go with you?
There are times, Bernard, when a man works best alone.
This is one of those times.
What did he mean by that?
I don't know, but it's something worth remembering.
- Bernard, I've missed you so.
- Me, too.
Shit.
Stupid. Bernard!
I get so tired of “Norwood! Norwood!“
- We better not.
- Yeah, what's wrong?
It's not right.
Yes, it is.
I mean, we're not married.
It's all right.
All right, I'll marry you.
When?
Today, just as soon as Mr. Weeks gets back.
Courtship activities have the further function
of regulating the timing of sex readiness,
so that the reproductive physiology of a pair
may be synchronized.
This is particularly important in a flying animal
which cannot afford to carry indefinitely the extra ballast
of greatly enlarged gonads.
Take me.
Uh, maybe we'd better wait until we're married this evening.
You're not going to leave me like this.
Well, we better go look for Mr. Weeks.
He's been gone a long time.
Let's not be sleeping on the job, Norwood.
It's Mr. Weeks!
Is he dead?
I don't know.
Then maybe we better find out.
Ok.
He's dead, all right.
Well, what do you think we ought to do?
Call the police.
Good idea.
What are you doing?
I'm getting the number of the police.
Oh, Bernard.
Bernard, everything's so awful.
Kiss me?

Man's insatiable mind
goaded on by a handicapped body
will undoubtedly invent subtleties and refinements
for his present clumsy progress through the air.
But he will never obtain that mastery of the air
which is the result of the development of millions of years
acting on the self-contained mechanism of a living body!
Fly! Fly! Fly!
Fly!
Ladies and gentlemen,

Earth proudly presents
the cast of Brewster McCloud.

Shelley Duvall,
John Schuck...
G. Wood,
Corey Fischer,
Jennifer Salt,
Dean Goss,
Bert Remsen,
Angelin Johnson,
William Baldwin,

...and Mr. Bud Cort!
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to see
an unforgettable show:
A film destined to become immortal,
as immortal as the music
which will follow,
and which will be interpreted
through animation.
Beginning with his childhood fantasies,
the greatest ambition
that burns and swells
within the soul of every creative animator
is to illustrate music,
to give visual form and color to its notes.
With this film
we have finally succeeded
in achieving this union
of animation and classical music,
a union we are sure is destined
to live on throughout the history of film.
A new and original film that has even astonished us, the men responsible, the men who, quite modestly speaking, can be called its creators.
A film in which... in which...
A film in which you will see the music and listen to the drawings.
You might call it a film of magic, a fantasia.
Hello?
Yes. Who's speaking?
Who is this?
What do you mean, who am I?
Who is it you wish to speak to?
California?
It's Hollywood.
Hello! Yes.
What? You've already...
I don't understand. I'm sorry.
You've already done this?
Look, if this is some kind of joke,
I'm in no mood...
There must be some misunderstanding.
You're very ill-mannered.
That's right... ill-mannered and a liar!
Yes, I said you're a liar!
A liar from California!
It's nothing. They're mad.
Mad as hatters.
They insist that our film... this is all so ridiculous... was already made by a certain fellow years ago.
A certain someone by the name of Prisney or Grisney.
Some American.
In any case, before you go around opening your big mouth, see the film first!
Where were we?
Settle down now.
Damned hags!
What's this racket?
Calm down!
All right, let's go.
Hurry up! No time to lose.
The film's already started.
Run!
Move it!
Get the lead out!
Come on!
Get in the car.
It's time you earned your keep.
We haven't kept you here out of charity!
Where are our instruments?
They're already at the theater, along with your clothes.
Hold on tight when we get moving.
You wouldn't want to hurt yourself now of all times, would you?
Pisney has already done this?
Let's go!
Hiring an orchestra wasn't a problem.
But the principle challenge that remained was to secure the creative collaboration of a true artist.
A free artist.
Free of all conditioning, free of all compromise, an animator capable of independent self-expression.
How's it going?
You look more cheerful than usual.
You knew this was your big day, huh?
Tell the truth.
You knew it!
Finding the ideal artist to create
our animation was no small task.
We had to bind him...
bind him to ourselves
in a contract based on trust
and mutual respect.
Come on, now.
After five years hanging around, you can't be tired!
That's good.
On your feet.
Hurry, the orchestra's waiting.
Can't you hear it?
Let's go!
Wash your dentures if you want to play trombone.
Kick the drums, not me, thank you.
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Kick her!
If they hadn't put me in the first row,
I wouldn't have done it.
I made it clear
I wouldn't do nude scenes.
Where are you going?
The movie world is dreadful.
I've always defended my virtue.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
This has never been done...
Just a moment.
And so it's come! The great moment...
I said wait a minute.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
The only thing missing now is the orchestra conductor!
Girls, babes, beauties, let's get started with Debussy's
Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.
A wonderful piece!
There'll certainly be lots to inspire our artist's imagination as he renders this music in visual form and gives it new life.
Yes, relying on nothing more than his trusty pencil,
I'm sure he'll succeed in bringing new life... in bringing new life to this great piece of music.
The artist creates!
Ready, girls?
The Debussy piece!
Good. Really great.
Sit down or I'll hang you back on the wall!
Sit down!
I did not enjoy that.
You didn't entertain me!
Quite an afternoon, eh?
Granny!
How do you feel?
A bit scattered, maestro.
Pick up all the pieces, and don't miss any!
Cheer up!
Everything's all right.
I'm feeling a bit scattered, maestro.
How's it going, girls?
Everyone all right?
Suppose we try some simple exercises.
Stand up... and sit down.
And up... and down again.
Hey, you there.
Me?
Come with me for a minute.
Do as he says.
Come along, granny.
You look a little pale, and your reflexes are a bit impaired.
It's nothing.
You'll get over it.
It's not easy maintaining order in an orchestra.
It calls for an iron fist in a velvet -
Glove! An iron first in a velvet glove.
Girls, our second piece will be Dvorak's Slavic Dance No. 7.
Mind you, the tempo is allegro.
Poor guy hasn't even noticed yet!
Take a break, everyone!
Bohemia crystal.
Fruit, uh... exotic fruit.
Chicken.
A potato.
We're catching on fire here.
Me too!
Is it good?
So, maestro, what's next on the program?
Ravel's Bolero.
Ah, Ravel's Bolero.
And who wrote that?
Ravel.
Of course. Ravel's Bolero was written by Ravel. Who else?
Ravel's Bolero. A great piece!
Ravel, the great, uh...
French composer.
- French, right?
- Yeah.
At least on his mother's side.
His father was from Umbria.
Born in Gubbio, if I'm not mistaken.
In the very heart of Umbria.
"Bolero"is a magical word.
A fantasy of color and sound.
There are thousands of ways to describe
this great musical work.
Go over there and grab the chicken.
Go on!
...in a "bolerian" vein.
Ravel's Bolero.
We didn't come here to stuff our faces.
I think this is the end of Part One.
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO
What's that ape doing here?
There's no ape in the script.
Other animals, yes, but no ape.
Reminds me of a young man I met back in 1912, before the First World War.
They just don't make men like that anymore.
Snow in the theater.
A very bad sign.
Let me go!
This can't be happening!
What is he doing?
He's getting the women too excited!
I knew it. When I get nervous, my eye clamps shut.
The next piece is
Sibelius' Valse Triste.
And you better get it right, or I'll hang you back up on the wall.
Remember the wall?
Bravo!
What feeling!
We can't go on like this.
The pieces turn out too sad!
He has no sense of humor!
I'm gonna put him back on the wall!
He'll rot in chains!
Calm down, now!
Aren't we equally to blame?
An artist needs beauty in order to express himself best, and frankly speaking, those particular girls may not be ideal.
Nonsense! Art is art!
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.
What if we were to find him a woman?
A woman he could be with.
Then he'd really start creating.
It'd be perfect!
I'm going to find one.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
Mr. Artist, how's it going?
You look a bit run-down.
I've got some fun for you.
I know a cozy little hideaway.
Come back here.
Get in there.
You know what we want.
Easy as falling off a log.
You get in the piano, and nature will do the rest.
Go on, now!
Hello, everyone!
Our orchestra, such as it is, the piano, and our artist.
Try to cheer him up.
Want a hand?
The next piece promises to be lively and full of spice.
A concerto by Vivaldi.
Think we're overdoing it?
Let's get him out.
Yeah, looks like they're having too much fun.
That should be enough.
Lift up the lid.
That's the snag with these old pianos.
Getting in is a breeze, but getting out can be a problem.
You better make me laugh now, or I'll tear you apart piece by piece!
He looks better already.
He'd better, or I'll see that he does!
He's much more alive.
Look at his eyes!
I'll tear them out!
You'll see.
The next piece will be fantastic!
Get ready.
Curtain!
Curtain!
I'll show you!
I'll take this pianist and throw her on your head!
I'll break every bone in your body!
It's all right!
It's nothing, nothing at all.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Let her go, will you?
A small difference of opinion.
It's absolutely nothing.
Turn the camera around.
It's nothing at all.
The next number on our program is the famous Firebird, by Igor Stravinsky.
A very famous piece.
Knock it off!
Turn the camera around.
Igor Stravinsky.
One of the most renowned...
A cascade of notes.
It's music that...
Let me go!
I don't have insurance!
Put me down!
Voilà!
Everything is just fine.
The conductor is taking just a few moments to himself, but he'll be back with us very soon.
Okay. Where's the camera?
Where is the camera?
Ah, there it is.
With that little interruption behind us, our performance will now continue with Dostoyevsky's Firebird.
As they say in English...
Which in Italian would mean...
A snake!
Stop! Where are you going?
Come back!
It's just a snake!
Stop!
We've got antidote for snake bite!
There's no problem!
We've got tons of antidote!
Damn it, you old hags! Stop!
Do you hear? Stop, I say!
Traitors!
Leaving me at a time like this.
I even have a cold.
And all because of a little snake.
Look! There's nothing left!
Everything's destroyed!
And here we are once again!
Now for a finale of a different sort, one we had planned and prepared.
One that needs neither orchestra nor conductor nor music.
I'm happy to say our artist is still here with us.
Our artist who...
What are you doing?
What the devil are you doing?
Drawing her?
What do you think you're doing?
You can't leave me here like this!
Hey, wait a second!
Wait for me!
I'm going with you!
I want to go too!
Wait!
Don't go!
How will we finish the film?
We haven't done a finale!
Wait for me!
We have to do a finale!
I have to find a good idea for a finale.
The telephone!
That's it! I'll call the archives.
Hello, Franceschini?
You have to help me find a finale!
Any finale at all.
The files are full of'em!
Bring me one right away!
A finale.
It's all over.
Ready, girls?
We've got to do Stravinsky's Firebird.
It's over with.
The finale, then.
That's all over with too.
You might as well go back down there.
We're unemployed, then.
Unemployed... until the next movie.
I've already got an idea.
A brand-new idea.
We could do a love story.
A love story?
But not the usual kind about men and women.
Lots of men with lots of women.
Wife-swapping?
No, not that same old stuff.
Something different.
I like asymmetry.
Seven men and one woman.
That'll cost a lot.
No, not at all.
We'll get little tiny men... and we'll make the woman real tall.
It'll be fantastic!
Sounds scary.
Careful.
What do you mean, scary?
Seven little workers, so you get the social context, too.
A mine! They'll work in a mine!
I can see them now, singing happily.
Have you thought of a title?
That'll be easy. Let's see.
"Sleeping Beauty."
Now, keep it under your hat or some screenwriter hack might steal the idea.
You can't trust anyone these days.
He'll change the title, play up the sex, and give it some crazy name like
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
And then we'll be screwed!
Morthond! Morthond! Morthond!
Morthond wins.
Pelele!
Agado!
Pelele!
Pelele wins.
Agnim! Cord!
Cord wins!
Morthond! Pelele!
Morthond wins!
Cord! Morthond!
Gentlemen, this is the final contest.
Morthond! Morthond! Morthond!
Morthond is the winner.
You've, uh, made a mistake.
You gave the medallion to the wrong man.
Is this your color?
No.
There was no error.
You hit him after he was down.
There are rules, and you have broken them.
You have chosen to break almost every rule of the contest.
You wear no fighting clothes, you belong to no group.
I am my own man.
Then why have you come here if you need no one but yourself?
I've come a long way to compete for the right to find Zetan and defeat him and to see what is in a book he guards.
What do you know of Zetan and his Book of Enlightenment?
Only that it's a book.
That it contains all the wisdom of the world.
Cord, he who is chosen to find and defeat Zetan must have the ability to bind an elephant with the web of a spider.
Not stun him with a kick.
Morthond has been chosen!
Morthond is a dancer!
I'm a fighter!
Morthond has controlled himself.
You are not yet the tempered weapon that we need.
Go!
Now!
One question first.
Why have all the others you've sent never returned?
The trials along the way are severe.
Zetan has proved himself so far to be invincible.
It is because you have never sent the right man!
But I can defeat him!
Cord!
You will not go.
I will defeat this invincible Zetan!
And I will see what is in the book!
One year ago,
I took a vow of silence.
When did you break it?
Now!
Why are you following me?
You're angry because I defeated you.
You didn't defeat me!
You broke the rules!
Fight me again!
It serves no purpose.
You were born without a brain!
Fight me!
But I want to help you, not kill you.
It's Zetan I'm after.
The important thing is eating the fruit, not how you get to it.
Eat then.
My name is Cord.
I'm looking for a great martial artist called Zetan.
There's a bee near your nose.
Who are you?
Last night,
I saw you perform miracles.
If Zetan's skills are even greater than yours, I-
I'm not ready for him.
With all my training and both my eyes,
I couldn't survive one second against you.
My skills are not there to impress you.
I've got it!
Now I know!
You're Zetan.
I'm the one who's blind!
Are you Zetan?
Whatever you think I am, or want me to be,
I am.
Be my teacher.
Explain what you do.
I want to practice.
Tie two birds together and though they have four wings
- they cannot fly.
Well, I'll just follow you and watch.
And I won't annoy you by talking.
I can be silent, believe me.
They say Zetan's the guardian of a book.
He's had it for many years.
Do you know anything about this book? Know what it is?
Do you, uh, think it could be important?
If a man guards a book year after year, which is more important?
The man or the book?
Is that the secret?
The monkey tried to circle you- and you wouldn't let him- you kept turning.
The way of the monkey is to play the fool.
While you laugh at his antics, he bites you from behind.
Unmask his ego, and you expose a coward disguised as a monkey.
I'll study them.
I'll watch them very carefully.
You already imitate their chattering perfectly.
Huh!
I don't have any reason to fight monkeys.
This lesson has no value.
One is taught in accordance to one's fitness to learn.
I'll tear my tongue out and put it-
Morthond! Wait!
It's Cord!
I have brought disgrace on my brotherhood.
Zetan did this?
Morthond, answer me!
How did this happen?
The first trial.
What was it?
Morthond, what was the first trial? Where?
Monkey.
Cord. The medallion.
Take it.
How can I help you, Morthond?
Help me die with honor.
The way of the monkey is to play the fool.
Unmask his ego, and you expose a coward disguised as a monkey.
Who are you?
My name is Cord.
Where is your begging bowl?
I'm not here to beg.
You're not here to beg?
I'm here to face the first trial.
Then you will beg.
What school do you come from?
Hmm?
No school.
No school!
I come from myself.
Ah! He comes from himself!
A man with no mother!
What are you looking for, man with no mother?
What?
I want to find Zetan.
And you think that to find him you must fight me, huh?
Yes, what acknowledged style of fighting do you use?
My style.
Listen to me, man who creates himself.
Go back... the way you came, in peace.
I don't want to go back.
And I don't want to fight you unless I have to to find Zetan.
Zetan is far away on the other side of me.
To reach him, you must first pass through... me!
What if I just walk around you?
That is not in the order of things!
Yes, if I am your trial, then I am your trial.
You cannot walk around me.
Then I'll have to fight you.
Yes.
Now tell me the way to Zetan.
Embrace the west wind until you come to a wilderness.
Look for a rose there.
Look for a rose?
Is that the second trial?
You asked the way to Zetan.
Are there others ahead of me?
You are the first to pass me.
But other seekers have other trials.
Am I a beggar with a begging bowl now?
I put you in my bowl!
Can I help you?
To do what?
To get out of this-
Why?
Who's torturing you this way?
No one.
Isn't that barrel filled with oil?
Of course.
I filled it myself.
You? I filled it myself, and I got in it myself.
I've been in here ten years.
But why?
To rid myself of the bottom half of me.
There's very little left of it now.
Your legs look like seaweed.
I hope so.
That thing- that terrible thing between my legs- it's almost gone no, isn't it?
A mere pimple.
Good.
It'll go altogether soon,
I hope.
Ten years!
How do you live without eating?
My family. They bring me a little rice, a little water.
Your family?
They know you’re dissolving yourself in oil?
They weren't too happy about it at first.
Especially my wife.
Now she understands.
But why would you want to-
Ah.
You could have taken a vow of chastity, like I have.
I took a vow of chastity. I took ten vows
- a hundred.
How can a man be a holy man when that terrible thing attaches him to the earth?
I got rid of my money,
I shed my clothes,
I ate a spoonful of rice each day, and my mind began to soar.
I felt the universe.
I was the universe.
And then, that terrible thing summoned me.
"Hello!" it cried.
"Think of the pleasure!"
Several times,
I grabbed a knife.
I intended to rid myself of it once and for all.
But I-
I was a coward.
Then... I found a way!
I would dissolve it away and the legs that carried it along.
Oh, you are obviously mentally disturbed.
Mm-hmm. You should have seen a doctor.
I am a doctor.
You took a vow of chastity.
Yes.
You won't keep it.
Come in here with me.
There's plenty of room.
We'll keep each other company.
I'm sorry, but I must go.
I'm looking for someone.
Who?
Zetan.
Again Zetan!
They all come around asking about Zetan!
There is no answer in Zetan.
The answer is in here with me.
If you won't melt it off, cut it off!
Do it now! For whatever your dreams are, it will ruin them!
It's like a sword, that terrible thing!
It will-
It will cut you to pieces!
Have you eaten?
Where’s your drink?
Your hand is empty.
Peace.
Don't wish it on me!
The whole world is in commotion, and you wish me peace!
I don't know what peace is. I don't want it.
Don't you listen to the desert?
Even when there's no windy the sand sings.
My name is Cord.
Hah! You see? Cord!
Play a chord!
Strike a chord!
Even your name is a noise!
What do you want, Cord?
You want us to play on you?
My wives can make your skin sing.
Who are you?
Changsha.
It is my wish to provide everything that is needed.
Tell me what you need, Cord, that I may find happiness in providing it for you.
I seek a rose... in the wilderness.
Her name is Tara.
My ninth wife.
You may have her.
But I've taken a vow of chastity.
Hah, hah! Well, taking her will be a twin sacrifice.
Her of her vows to me, and you of your vows to yourself.
My second trial.
Is it with you?
Perhaps.
Who knows?
Do you know?
Huh?
Is it still your needy my friend, to test yourself against me?
It is my need.
Then put out your handy my black brother, for what you feel will satisfy you.
You came to me to test yourself, and in losing, you have gained your victory.
For now, you are on the threshold of truth.
That knowledge- that gift, which is what you really want from me- you have it now.
When do we fight?
After we sleep, my boy.
It pleases you?
- Where is your-
- No harm will come to you.
My husband sent me to you.
Is he Zetan?
He is Changsha.
Not the keeper of the book?
What book?
Why did he send you?
This will not violate your vow.
The desired fruit may be enjoyed without consuming it.
I've been traveling for a long time.
Rest.
I've been taking a journey that was indicated in the palm of my hand.
You're my trial, aren't you?
Let me walk the line in your palm with you for a moment.
No.
Let me show you.
You asked to walk the line of my palm with me.
You refused me!
Do you invite me now?
Walk with me, but not for just a moment.
Forever.
Cord.
I'll go with you, but first we must rest.
What lies ahead of us will not be easy.
Tara?
Tara!
No!
Changsha!
Changsha!
Cord! I am here.
Cord! I am here.
Zetan?
Stronger than Zetan.
Death. I know you.
Why are you so ugly?
Or do you have a different face for every man?
Shall I go to my knees?
Are you waiting for fear to freeze my heart before you carve it out?
Soon, Cord! Soon!
Come anytime, welcome guest.
It can't be done.
You can't do it.
Can't do what?
You can't step twice on the same piece of water.
A fish saved my life once.
How?
I ate him.
How long have you been blind?
How long have you been blind?
I'm not blind.
Am I?
Do you answer every question with a question?
Do you question every answer?
Talking to you is like talking to a wall.
Buddha once sat before a wall, and when he arose, he was enlightened.
Do you compare yourself with Buddha?
Hah, hah, no; only to the wall.
You have not told me of your second trial.
It wasn't a trial.
It was a lesson.
Teach it to me.
Ah, you know it.
You seem to know everything.
Each morning when I awake, like a scholar at his first classy
I prepare a blank mind for the day to write upon.
A year ago
I took a vow of chastity.
A day ago I broke it.
Gladly, because
I realized we are born to love.
But what I did then was worse than taking any foolish vow.
I tried to possess what I loved.
I didn't know then that the embrace of love held too tightly can destroy the one you love.
Cord.
Each moment that passes changes you.
You do not- cannot possess even yourself.
How can you hope to possess anyone or anything else?
I realize now you are my hidden teacher.
And if I am to survive the next trial, I must be allowed to follow you and to learn.
You will never endure it.
I will.
Will I?
Hah, hah, tell me why
I won't be able to endure it.
You will never have the patience.
You will see things and judge them before you know what they mean. What things?
You see? You ask what things even before the things have happened.
Your impatience is beyond me.
I'll be patient.
I'll be an empty vessel!
One condition.
Anything.
You must ask nothing about any event until such time as
I myself give you an answer.
Agreed.
We wish to cross your river.
What is the fare for the two of us?
You don't look as if you have money.
Ah! Ah!
Will this be payment enough?
Aha.
Yes, yes, this will do.
Wait, you old fool!
Let me see.
It's worthless.
If you want to cross the river, swim.
Stop that! This is an honest man.
Like you are a good man in bed, you silly stick!
No money, no transportation.
It is my boat!
I will decide.
Your boat?
Your poor son’s and mine.
Since when is it yours?
Since I married you, you ignoramus!
Didn't I pay for it with the gift of my body... and the blessing of a boy child?
Hah! The gift you gave me once twenty years ago!
How do you expect to get the boat back, you idiot? You never think of nothing.
That poor man.
He's happy.
Happy?
There's misery in every bone in his body.
Is not a happy man one who does not fear death?
Not only does he not fear it, his days are filled with joy looking forward to it.
Why'd you do that?
He wanted to help us.
Is that how you repay him?
You’ve destroyed his livelihood.
He'll be defenseless against her now.
I told you you would jump to conclusions.
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.
There's nothing here to hide from.
Not yet.
Ah! They've seen you.
I never thought you'd run from a fight.
It's hard to kill a horse with a flute.
Why do you have to pick now to do good deeds?
You're feeling guilty because you kicked in the ferryman's boat, so you're committing suicide.
You're not only a fool, you can't keep a promise.
What promise? You said you would tear out your tongue-
The chimney's broken too.
We could fix that.
And the roof needs mending.
I'm thinking of saying good-bye.
Good-bye.
I was crazy to believe you were my teacher.
Learn to listen to that which is not spoken.
I'm tired of your riddles.
There was no lesson in what just happened.
All I saw was a fool inviting his assassins to kill him.
The fool is the twin of the wise.
Ah.
And you can't step on the same piece of water twice, and two birds tied together have four wings but cannot fly, and- and- and the tadpole loses its strength, and the sword can't cut itself.
The path and the gateway have no use or meaning once the objective is in sight.
And a horse has no udders, and a cow can't whinny, and up is down, and sideways is straight ahead.
Oh, look. Look.
Who are they?
Ow!
Mister, please.
Do you have a coin?
Coin! Coin! Please.
Why?
This time I'm leaving.
You must stop making promises.
This is more than a promise.
Now that I'm free of you,
I'm free to ask questions.
Explain yourself.
What did you mean by kicking in the ferryboat?
Of the two of us, you are the one who is blind.
Blinded by what you see.
I want an answer, not all this philosophy.
I damaged the boat because if I hadn't, the soldiers would have used it to cross the river, and the old man and all his family would have been killed.
Achieving his happiness, perhaps.
But how did you know the soldiers were coming?
- Did you hear them?
- No.
The stone wall.
Why did you stop to repair it?
There was a bag of coins partly exposed in the stones.
I repaired the wall so the soldiers wouldn't find it and steal it, leaving the widow and her children without means.
You couldn't see the bag.
Did you smell it?
No.
The boy. Explain the boy.
The boy.
You mutilated the boy. You broke his nose, a beautiful boy.
Too beautiful.
He was a tyrant. He would have grown up to be worse.
I freed his parents from their bondage to his beauty.
Hah! You didn't even touch his face.
How'd you know what he looked like? Did you sense it?
No. But I freed his parents and the boy too, and now,
I free you of me.
Well, I haven't finished yet.
You didn't hear the soldiers, and you didn't smell the bag, and you didn't sense the boy.
I want an explanation.
I knew.
How?
You were through here before!
How many times?
What is this?
Cord?
Hah, hah, yes, Cord!
The man I entertained in the wilderness.
The very same Cord, yes.
No, not the same.
Not quite.
But you’re still looking for the same-
Zetan.
Hah! Yes.
Zetan.
He's very near.
Oh. Very, very near.
All you have to do is pass by me.
I have no quarrel with you.
No quarrel?
Hah, hah, but what of your love,
Tara?
Did I not crucify Tara?
No.
But I myself, with these two hands-
No,
I myself, with these two hands.
Not the same Cord.
So, you do not confront me with hate.
No.
Then why confront me at all?
Join me.
Take my hand.
Ah, I can show you a world where you will find no night or day.
The sun will never rise or set.
My goal is Zetan.
Ah, yes.
At daybreak then.
Along the beach.
No.
Now.
Huh?
Huh?
Not the same Cord.
Your way lies across the water.
You are the chosen.
You have sought Zetan.
Zetan is here.
My dear Cord.
I am so pleased to see you.
Extraordinary what the soil here does for the perfume.
Please.
Who are they?
They are the Near Ones.
They are studying the perfecting of perfection.
Are you their teacher?
No, not really.
We have found that the best way is for the teacher, so called, and the student to produce the teaching together.
What do you think?
Yes, it sounds reasonable.
Is something disturbing you, Cord?
No.
You seem somewhat puzzled.
I want to know when we fight.
Who?
You and I.
About what?
The book.
The everlasting book.
Very well.
We will go to the terrace and rehearse you in the ceremony.
What ceremony?
The one that precedes your being made the keeper of the book.
Wait! Wait!
I don't understand.
This is the seat of harmony, Cord.
There seems to me to be nothing but harmony on this island.
Yes, it, uh, permeates everything here.
Try the seat, Cord.
Go on, try it.
Can you see your future, Cord?
Endless days of peace.
Is there any man who can wish for more?
The book, please.
The book.
You have survived several trials, I am sure.
Very frightening they must have been, but what you are about to see now may be even more alarming.
You can take my place here, Cord, without looking into the book, just as I did many years ago.
I must look first.
The seekers fight their way here, year after year, willing, eager to pay a terrible price to see what is in that book.
And when they fling it open in blazing expectation of finding all the answers to all life's questions, what do they find?
Themselves.
There is no book, Cord.
No enlightenment outside yourself.
There is nothing to take back?
No.
They are here, most of them.
Others have gone back into the world, and in all manner of disguises, they have provided the trials such as you have experienced.
Some become teachers.
And one of them plays a flute that only I can hear!
I was your age when
I was sent to find the book, and I became the keeper.
Now you, Cord- you can be the keeper.
You will enjoy it- the endless peace and pleasure!
Release me, Cord!
Release me.
You've looked at the book, Cord.
Yes.
And what did you see?
Everything.
One day, when I was 6 years old,
I saw a magnificent picture in a nature book about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing an animal.
I'm trying to make a sketch of it to show you.
Under this splendid picture, it said;
"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."
There.
"And then remain stationary for six months digesting it."
I pondered that deeply.
And after some work, I succeeded in making my first drawing.
I called it Drawing Number One.
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups.
I asked them if it frightened them.
Frighten us?
Why should we be frightened of a hat?
A hat?
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
Obviously.
Since the grownups were not able to understand it, I made another, showing the elephant inside the boa constrictor, so they could see it clearly.
My Drawing Number Two.
This time, I was told to stop wasting my time drawing boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and attend to my studies, which I did.
And that is why, at the age of 6,
I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
As I grew up, whenever I'd meet one who seemed to be at all clear-sighted, in order to find out if he was really a person of true understanding,
I would show him my first drawing.
But whoever it was would say;
It's a hat, it's a hat
It's a sort of a kind of hat
Painted poorly
But it surely is a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
There's no doubt of it, it's a hat
Top of Papa
Is its proper habitat
My, oh, my, look at that
Why, this dummy has drawn a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
If it's anything, it's a hat
Why, it's nothing but a common
Himalayan mountain hat
A hat that looks like down upon
Which someone must've sat
Not Picasso or Corot
But a very nice chapeau
Are you kidding?
It's a hat, you silly brat
Every grownup was the same
Uniformly, they'd exclaim
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I could see it wasrt won'th
Spending time with them on earth
There were fewer in the sky
I decided I would fly
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I need air
Where only stars get in my hair
And only eagles stop and stare
I need air
All the world is mad
And I have had my share
I need air
I need air
I need air
One hour of mortal wear and tear
Gives my morale moral-de-mer
Any corner lot
That heavers got to spare
I need air
I need air
There's not a sign of life down there
Just hats and grownups everywhere
I need air
Lots of cozy sky
That God and I can share
I need air
I need air
Over the years,
I came to know many grownups, and my opinion of them never improved.
In time, I stopped showing my drawing and never again mentioned boa constrictors, elephants or stars.
Instead, I would talk about golf, money, politics and neckties.
And everyone was pleased to have met such a sensible man.
So I lived my life alone, without anyone I could really talk to, until a short time ago.
I was testing a new plane, racing it against the clock from Paris to India.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Come in, please, over.
F-BDXY to Paris.
Ground speed: 1 -9-0.
Running ten minutes behind schedule.
Strong headwinds.
Trouble!
- Losing altitude!
- Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Are you there, F-BDXY?
Where are you?
If you please, draw me a sheep.
Will you?
- Will I what?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Who are...?
Where did you...?
How did you...?
How did you get here?
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you to draw me a sheep.
No, no. Listen to me.
- Where did you come from?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Don't you know any other words?
Is that all you can say?
No.
Will you draw me a sheep?
When a mystery is too overpowering, one doesn't dare disobey.
A thousand miles from civilization and death at my heels,
I picked up a pad and pencil and began to draw.
Look, I...
I don't know how to draw.
- That doesn't matter.
- And I certainly can't draw a sheep.
I've only drawn one thing in my whole life.
Here.
Oh, no. I don't want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
A boa constrictor is very dangerous, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
Where I live, everything is very small.
What I need is a sheep.
Do you live in a small town?
On a small island?
Where is it very small?
What sort of object is that?
- What?
- That.
It's called an aeroplane.
It flies.
I was flying in it, but it broke down.
Then you must have dropped from the sky.
That's right.
You too. How funny.
If you don't mind, I prefer having my misfortunes taken seriously.
- What do you mean, "you too"?
- That's a very sick-Iooking sheep.
Is that how you got here?
In a plane that crashed?
Could you make another?
- Why?
- Because that one doesn't look well.
This is not the way two strangers get to know each other on the average desert.
This is the way.
Ask me a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Good.
To which I reply,
"I come from Paris."
Now I'll ask you a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it's on this planet.
I'm sorry, it won't do.
- Why not?
- See for yourself.
That's not a sheep.
It's a ram. It has horns.
Do you think this is all I have to do?
I have this engine to take apart and fix before my water runs out.
I have no time to draw for a little boy dressed in a coat, carrying a sword, who appears from nowhere in the middle of the Sahara.
There, and that's the last.
There's no horns.
No.
It's not sick.
No.
- Well, then?
- It's old.
I'm sorry.
It's only his box.
The sheep you asked for is inside.
That's perfect, exactly the way I wanted it.
It is?
Good.
Do you think this sheep will need a lot of grass?
- Why?
- I told you.
Where I come from, everything is very small.
Don't worry.
It's a very small sheep.
This sheep isn't so small.
Alas, I couldn't argue with him.
I'd grown too old to see sheep through the walls of boxes.
Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it is.
Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget.
But why did you ask?
- Arert you from this planet?
- The thing that's so good about this box is, at night, he can use it as his house.
- He's just going to sleep.
- Oh, sorry.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Where in God's name could you have come from?
- Do you know what asteroids are?
- What whats are?
- Asteroids.
- No.
They're very, very small planets.
The smallest, Asteroid B-61 2, was discovered by a Turkish astronomer in 1 909.
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that mean they also eat baobab bushes?
- Who?
- The sheep.
Do they also eat flowers?
- Do they?
- Just hold it a minute, will you?
- Do they also eat flowers?
- What?
Oh, yes, they do.
Except the flowers that have thorns, of course.
No, they even eat the flowers that have thorns.
But the thorns protect them, don't they?
Maybe from being picked, but not from being eaten.
Then what's the good of having them?
- Having what?
- Thorns.
I don't know. Spite, I suppose.
Flowers have thorns just for spite.
I don't believe you.
Flowers are weak and helpless, and they know it.
How could they face the world if they didn't believe they were protected?
- What I'm doing here is important.
- Important?
Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years.
And for millions of years, sheep have been eating them just the same.
Eating them.
And you think that's not important?
- Of course it is.
- I know one flower that's unique in all the world.
It grows nowhere but on my planet.
But some morning, a sheep can come along and destroy it with one single bite.
And you think that's not important?
- I suppose so.
- What you don't understand is, that if someone loves one flower that grows on one star among all the millions and millions of stars in the sky, it's enough to make him happy to look at the stars.
He can say to himself,
"Somewhere my flower's up there."
But if a sheep eats the flower, in one moment, all the stars will go dark.
And you think that's not important?
It's not a matter of consequence to you, is it?
Wait!
Wait! Come back!
I most humbly apologize.
I was behaving like a grownup.
Your flower is very important.
I swear it.
Come back!
Please!
Please come back!
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Little man, don't you know
That I'm on your side?
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Little man, let me show you
I'm on your side
This world
Is an ocean without any shore
When you're on your own
Dawn is the end of the rope
When you're all alone
I've been, I've seen
I've known it
Where can you be?
Where can you be?
Hurry back, and you'll see
That I'm on your side
Where did you run?
Why did you run
From the one, only one
Who is on your side?
Everybody needs a friend
Come make use of me
God gave people hands to lend
Mine are free
So why stay away?
Come what may
I'm on
Your side
I missed him.
I wished I'd discovered more about him.
But he'd gone and taken his mystery with him.
Unaccustomed as I am to drawing anything but boa constrictors and elephants,
I decided to make a portrait of him so that I wouldn't forget him.
After all, he was a friend.
And not everyone has a friend.
Least of all me.
I'm hungry.
I have your supper right here.
I waited as long as I could.
I'd advise saving some of that till tomorrow.
That is, of course, unless you're very hungry.
Is this all you have?
Well, at the moment, yes.
This will be quite enough, thank you.
Needless to say, that problem you outlined, concerning the flower you know.
The one on the star, and your sheep...
In fact, all flowers and all sheep, that's...
That's extremely important.
In fact, I can't think of anything that's more important.
Well, I've been giving it a great deal of thought, and I...
I think I've come up with a solution that will remove your flower from any possibility of danger.
Now, this is my plan.
But this is subject to your approval, of course.
One, to draw a muzzle for your sheep.
Two...
If you can describe your planet to me in sufficient detail for me to make a drawing of it,
I'll put up a big, strong fence all around your flower.
Would you really do that?
Smaller.
Smaller.
I have three volcanoes.
- How big are they?
- Very big.
- Compared to you?
- Knee-high.
I have to clean them out every day.
- All by yourself?
- There's no one else.
There are three baobab bushes.
You don't have to draw them.
They don't come up for a while.
- Where's your house?
- On the other side.
You don't have to draw that either.
And my flower lives on this side here.
When she first came through the ground,
I was afraid she was going to be a baobab, but then she blossomed.
One bright, yellow morning, she blossomed.
- Good morning.
- Stop.
What is it?
- Give me a moment to wake up.
- I'm sorry.
How beautiful you are.
Yes, I know.
I was born at the same moment as the sun.
- Did you know that?
- No.
- Did you know you were quite selfish?
- Selfish?
Instead of thinking of my needs, you're standing there doing what you want to do, which is stare at me.
- What is it you need?
- Water.
- Water?
- I realize this is a small,
- unequipped little planet.
- I'll get it for you right away.
I brought her some water.
I brought it every day.
I did everything I could for her.
It's cooler when the sun goes down.
Do you have a glass bowl to put over me?
That will only make you weaker.
The night air is good for you.
I'm cold!
I'm cold!
You promised me a glass bowl.
It's not cold.
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you very much.
You've made my planet beautiful.
I don't believe it.
If you loved me, you'd know how cold I am.
I promise you, the nights aren't long.
You'll soon get used to it.
- Do you love me?
- I'll get the bowl.
I couldn't understand it, and I couldn't understand her.
I loved her, but I was so unappy.
I began to realize
I didn't really understand anything.
So I decided to leave my planet and go out into the universe and try to learn something.
I was wrong to leave her.
But at the time,
I didn't even understand that.
I was too young.
One morning,
I cleaned out my volcanoes, took one last look for baobabs and put my planet in order.
Good morning.
- You're all dressed up.
- Yes.
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.
- You're going away, aren't you?
- Yes.
- For a long time?
- Perhaps.
I see.
It's my fault you're going, isn't it?
I've been very foolish, haven't I?
I wonder who will call on me when you're not here.
There are those two caterpillars, of course.
I don't like them, but one has to put up with them if one wants to meet butterflies.
For anything else, I have my thorns.
Well...
...if you're going...
: : : go:
- Goodbye.
- Be happy, be happy, be happy
Forget that I have no one
And nowhere to go
Be happy, be happy, be happy
Don't think of me in winter
All covered with snow
Be happy, be happy
Forget that I'll be crying still
And never
Will be happy
Be happy
Without you
Stop!
- Where are your papers?
- What papers?
You can't cross the border without papers.
- What border?
- That border there.
- You need a visa. Do you have one?
- No.
Then you can't cross it.
Those are the rules. Stop!
You almost backed into another country.
What are you? A smuggler?
A refugee? An idealist?
- Speak up. What are you?
- I'm ignorant.
Well, you might outgrow it.
Now, look...
My country is too small for both of us, but I have a colonial possession
1 foot to your left.
If your papers are in order, you can settle down there.
Your Majesty, it's such a small planet.
Why do you need borders?
Why do we need borders?
Yes. Why do you need borders?
You told me to ask questions.
But any child understands why we need borders.
- I don't.
- Well, of course you don't understand.
You're a child.
How do you expect
You can understand
International things and stuff?
Scissoring the earth
Carving up the land
Is the business of kings and stuff
Continentally, you are mentally
A silly-billy boy of 2
How absurd, it's uneard-of
You can never think as grownups do
Why, you
Why, you
Oh, you're a child
You're a child
You're a twerp
And that's putting it mild
You're a speck
You're a fleck
And it's just too tough
Pounding grown-up stuff
In the bean of a green little child
- Try.
- What?
Explain it to me. I want to learn.
Well...
Why do borderlines exist?
Well, first and foremost on the list
If all the borders were destroyed
Tomorrow, I'd be unemployed
And what would statesmen do for fun
If all at once the world was one?
And one could wander
Where he pleases
Flashing smiles instead of visas
Why, it could
It might
It would
Oh, go away and grow
Come again when you're
Not a mini-brained punk like this
You are really too undeveloped
For philosophical junk like this
Too adult is it? Difficult is it?
To get your teeth into?
Too bewildering for the children
And that, of course, means you
Means you
Means you
You're a child
You're a child
And the kind that can
Drive grownups wild
You're a wee little pea
Any thought profound
That I might expound
Wort fit into a pineaded child
Is that clear?
Now, where are your papers?
- I don't have any.
- You can't stay without papers.
Then I'll leave.
Just as well. You're dangerous.
Where's your passport?
- I don't have a passport.
- Then you can't leave.
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Four hundred million and 997,000...
...plus six, equals 400,997,006!
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Five hundred million and ten!
Five hundred million and ten.
Plus one.
Five hundred million and 32!
Five hundred million, 32 what?
Five hundred million and 32 plus three.
Those things.
Five hundred million and 35.
- Stars?
- That's it. Stars.
Five hundred...
...million, 44.
- Plus...
- Why are you counting the stars?
Five hundred million...
I own them, and I want to see how much I have.
But what good does it do you to own the stars?
- It does me the good of making me rich.
- What good is it to be rich?
Because...
I don't know.
But how can you own the stars?
When you find a diamond that doesn't belong to anyone, it's yours.
If you get an idea before anyone else, it's yours.
So I got the idea of owning the stars.
You want to stay here? Fine.
You can help me count.
But if I owned a flower,
I could do something for it.
What can you do for the stars?
You wouldn't understand.
You're a child.
Gimme, how can you
Gimme, understand
Gimme, gimme,
Financial stuff?
Gimme, your supply
Gimme, my demand
Mentally is gigantial stuff
Gimme oodles of
Gimme boodles of
I don't care what
But give me more
You're too poor and immature to know
What there are gimme-gimmes for
Why, you're
Why, you're
You're a child
You're a child
You're too darling and dopey and mild
You're a nit
Half a wit
Speaking wisdom-wise
Private enterprise
Is too big
For a twig of a child
Oh, stocks and bonds!
I've lost me place!
Now I shall have to start all over again.
Here, add up these figures.
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm searching for knowledge.
Oh, good.
You've come to the right place.
It's been said that I am the greatest historian in history.
That's wonderful, sir.
Who said it?
I said it. I wrote it.
I read it. It's printed.
Consequently, it's fact.
It's history.
And now that you're here,
I shall put you down.
In history, I mean.
- Where did you come from?
- From another planet, sir.
- What was it called?
- I don't know, sir.
Oh, good, I'll give it a name.
I like making things up.
That's my job, making things up.
I'm an historian.
Let me see. Planet...
Alice! Do you like that?
Oh, no, sir. The planet Alice?
I don't like it at all.
No wonder you left it.
Here. Read my latest, an official version of the French Revolution.
The other ones are now totally inoperative.
Is that the truth, sir?
- What?
- The truth.
How do you spell it?
Never mind, sir.
I don't think I'd better stay.
Right. Wipe!
Left. Left. Left.
Shoulders back. Left. Left. Left.
Left. Left. On your feet, boy.
On your feet.
Where's your arm, boy? Where?
- My arm?
- The colors. The colors.
The flag.
Sir, I don't see anyone.
How could you?
There's no one there, silly ass.
Get those shoulders back. Back. Back!
Not that much. Watch it.
Stand easy.
Welcome to the base.
State your business.
I'm trying to learn about life, sir.
- Learn about what?
- Life.
Life? Oh, life. That.
Yes, of course.
Company, double-quick march!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
You want to know what life is about?
Dying! That's what it's all about.
Die like a hero, boy.
That's the way to live. Company, halt!
Boy, this is your lucky day.
We just happen to have an opening.
There's not a blankety-blank soldier in the whole army. Just a general, me.
I can outthink the enemy but just can't fight them.
Enemy? What enemy?
There isn't any, dunce!
You've got to have your army first.
Then you find your enemy.
Company, on your stomachs! Crawl!
Join up, lad.
The army needs you, your country needs you, and most of all, I need you.
Every young man wants to be a soldier.
Speak up, boy. Any questions?
Which way is the next planet?
The next planet?
Oh, the next planet. It is called...
You know, it's that round thing.
It's called...
Dirt. No.
Mud.
No. Earth!
That's it, Earth. Bring up the cannon!
- Company, on your...
- Which way is it?
- Which way is what?
- Earth.
Earth? Oh, Earth.
That way. Crawl, men!
Shoulders back! Shoulders down!
What about it, boy...?
Come back!
Who said that?
Who are you?
Be my friend.
I'm alone.
"What a queer planet," I thought.
Everyone says the same thing.
Just about.
That was just one year ago, and all I've learned since I left her is that I should never have left her.
All of those little games of hers,
I didn't see all of the affection that was underneath.
One should never listen to flowers, should one?
I wouldn't know.
My experience is limited.
Oh, I have met a Daisy
But where we met is hazy
And I have walked the streets
With Marguerites
And clinging vines beside me
Oh, I've met a lot of those
But I never met a Rose
There's often been a Heather
An armful altogether
And I have even met
A Violet
Who almost satisfied me
Yes, I've met every kind that grows
But I never met a Rose
Among the Dahlias
I often dally
I left a Lily in the valley
But now and then, I ponder
And wonder as I wander
Among the fields and shrub
Perhaps the trouble is...
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Perhaps you werert really looking for one.
Perhaps.
While roaming through the clover
Could I have passed her over?
When all is said and done
Am I the one to blame?
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you feeling all right?
Why don't you rest for a little while.
I can't. We've run out of water.
Unless I can get this thing off the ground...
But I will.
Don't worry, I will.
- I'm not worried.
- Good.
We'll get some water from the well.
Well? What well?
- Out there.
- What?
- Did you see an oasis?
- No, but there must be one out there.
No.
We could get lost and never find water and never make it back to the plane.
No, I'd rather bet on the motor.
At least we know it can work.
- Where are you going?
- To the well.
I said we were staying here.
This way.
Why not this way?
Or that way or that way?
This way.
Coming?
This is suicide, don't you understand? Suicide.
Then maybe I won't have to find my friend The Snake.
- What are you saying?
- It doesn't matter.
It does matter. What snake?
I'll tell you about him later.
- Tell me now.
- You can't draw while you're walking.
The stars are beautiful because of a flower I can't see.
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
There is a reason
Lovely to tell
Because the desert
Is hiding a well
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
Millions of reasons
Tell me just one
At night, the desert
Is hiding the sun
Look! Look!
It's water.
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
- Why are you happy?
- Why do you think?
Because there's plenty
Of water to drink
Why was the desert
So lovely before?
Why was it lovely
But not anymore?
Water was hiding
No one could see
But now the water
Is hiding in me
- You mustrt forget your promise.
- What promise?
You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I won't forget.
But first, I want to hear more about that snake.
- Now?
- Now.
Very well, then.
I met him in a tree at the edge of the desert, not far from here.
There are some hills here.
He was the first real person I met when I landed here.
And until I met someone else,
I thought everyone on Earth was a snake.
I arrived on the other side of the tree.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You're talking to the wrong end.
You're a funny animal.
You're nothing but a tail.
Where's the rest?
- I'm not an animal.
- What are you?
What am I?
I'm a snake.
- I'm enchanted.
- Well, you should be.
You're all cold and slimy.
Thank you. It runs in the family.
Could you tell me what I've landed on?
Yes. This sunny section of the solar system is called the Sahara.
The name of this planet is Sahara?
No, no, no, no. This simmering spot of singing sand is called the Sahara.
The whole silly, stupid, smelly sphere is called the Earth.
Oh, good. I thought I'd come to the wrong place.
Oh, you have.
Listen.
You look like a nice fellow.
Why don't you take off your sword and stay a while.
You seem like a smart, sensible sort.
Why did you swing down to this sorry, sleazy swamp?
- I'm trying to learn something.
- I see.
Well, sir, this speck in space is a scholastic sewer.
All that you can learn here is sorrow. Sorrow.
If I were you, I'd scram.
I can't, my flock of birds have flown away.
- So?
- They brought me here.
I see.
Listen, you are so lucky that you met me.
Why am I lucky?
Well, you see, if someday, any day, you want to see your own small, sparkling star again,
I may have a solution.
You see, I have this special... sting.
It's almost painless, and it can send you scooting out of this sad slum and sailing into the sweet, sunny, splendiferous sky.
Really?
If you would like to cure the fever
Called life
Get some relief from all the struggle
And strife
The grandest medicine
That I can propose
Is under your nose
A snake in the grass
If you would like a spot
Where life never goes
Where you can leave your body
Home in your clothes
The finest travel agent
You'll ever meet
Is right at your feet
A snake in the grass
One sting
And you can say goodbye
To all of your friends
One sting
And you'll be singing
As your spirit ascends
All's well that ends
So any day or night
Wherever you are
If you would like to take
A trip to a star
The quickest transportation
Yet known to Man
Is none other than
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
If you would like to leave
That inuman race
And take up residence
Out yonder, in space
When you are ready
To go traveling on
Sit right down upon
A snake in the grass
One sting
Is quite enough to make you
Happy and free
One sting
And you'll discover
How relaxed you can be
Posthumously
And while you're wandering through
The heavenly blue
If you should see the Lord come
Strolling in view
Go up and say you bring him
Best wishes from his fallen old chum
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
One sting.
It's almost painless.
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
I'll be waiting.
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.
Are you looking for that snake in order to do away with yourself?
I can't get back to my planet any other way.
It's too far, and my birds have disappeared.
Well, of all the...
You...
Now, you listen to me. That snake's poisoned you against the Earth.
- It's not what The Snake said.
- He's hated us since the world began.
- It's what The Fox said.
- I'll tell you right now, you're not going to allow yourself to be poisoned. Is that clear?
- What fox?
- The fox I met after I met The Snake.
I see.
You certainly got yourself mixed up with a strange crowd.
All right, let's have it.
- Where did you meet The Fox?
- In a garden of roses.
How many roses in the garden,
I don't know how many roses, but if it's too difficult to draw...
No. No. Not at all.
Let's get every detail of this whole sordid nonsense out in the open.
When she finds out there are millions of flowers that look just like her, it will break her heart.
Good morning.
I thought I was rich.
I thought I had the most unique flower in all the world.
But all I had was a common rose.
A common rose and three volcanoes that came up to my knees.
And one of them was extinct at that.
That doesn't make me a very great prince, does it?
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're a prince?
Yes.
I'm a fox.
I'm sad. Would you play with me?
- No.
- Why not? It'll be fun.
Where are the others?
- What others?
- The other hunters.
There's no one here but me.
Please play with me.
I won't harm you.
- Then why do you have a gun?
- I don't have a gun.
- You must. You're a human being.
- I'm from another planet.
- Arert there guns on your planet?
- No.
Really?
- Are there hunters on your planet?
- No.
- Any chickens?
- No.
- Oh, well, nothing's perfect.
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
I can't play with you.
- I'm not tamed.
- What do you mean, "tamed"?
Can't you stay put? I'm getting dizzy.
Sorry. I just don't wish to become extinct.
Do you mean, if I move, you will disappear again?
- Of course.
- Why?
You're a human. I'm a fox.
I hunt chickens, you hunt foxes.
- But I don't.
- You're a human, and you also lie.
But I don't lie.
Then you're inuman.
To be tamed...
Let me know before you move.
See if this clears it up. Underneath the prince, you're a little boy.
Just like a million other little boys.
I'm a fox.
Just like a million other foxes.
But if you tame me...
...I won't be like all the other foxes, and you won't be like the little boys.
I'll be unique to you, and you to me.
- You understand?
- Sort of.
- Where are you?
- You moved.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
I have a very monotonous life.
I hunt chickens.
Men hunt me. They come, I hide.
They leave, I come out.
That's all.
But if you tamed me, everything would be different.
- Even the wheat fields.
- The wheat fields?
Of course.
I don't like bread, so I don't care about wheat. Wheat is the color of gold.
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat because it would remind me of you.
I'm going to sit down.
What would I have to do?
Well, every day, you would come and sit where you're sitting now.
You'd always come at the same time.
At, let's say, 4 in the afternoon.
I could start to get excited about... Oh, about 3:00.
If you came at any old time,
I couldn't get keyed up.
But what would I do at 4:00?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Of course not. If you did, I'd get frightened and I wouldn't come out.
It's like this.
At first, I'll hide behind the trees.
Trembling...
...as I do in winter.
In time
I'll start to feel at ease
Show my face
And we'll
- Beginter
- "Beginter"?
Get closer.
And closer.
And closer.
We'll go a glance at a time
A small advance at a time
We'll be afraid a bit
And shy a bit
Avoid each other's eye a bit
Less often each day
The ice will soften each day
As we get closer
And closer and closer
We'll go a blush at a time
A happy flush at a time
Begin to laugh a bit
And stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer
And closer and closer
And then one day
There'll come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Then we'll jump miles at a time
A million smiles at a time
Begin to love a lot
And live a lot
And give and give and give a lot
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
A little closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
And then one day
There will come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Begin to laugh a bit and stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer and closer
And closer
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
- A little closer
- And closer
- And closer
- And closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
After I tamed him, we stayed together for quite a while.
But then one day,
I had to say goodbye.
I think I'm going to cry.
I didn't want to make you unappy, but you asked me to tame you.
- I know.
- Then I haven't done you much good.
- It's all been a waste of time.
- No.
Because you wasted so much time on me...
...you made me feel very important.
But now I feel sort of responsible for you.
I should have warned you that would happen.
You always feel responsible for what you've tamed.
The moment he said that,
I understood everything.
He wasrt like all the other foxes in the world anymore.
I tamed him, and now he was unique, at least to me.
And my flower wasrt like all those other flowers, because I had fetched her a screen and put a glass bowl over her at night and listened when she grumbled, and now she was my rose.
And I was responsible for her, and
I had to go back and take care of her.
I brought you a present.
It's a secret.
So I wrote it down.
The last time I saw him, he was sitting in a wheat field.
What was the secret?
It's only with the heart that one can see clearly.
What's essential...
...is invisible to the eye.
It works!
Eureka! It works!
I need air!
It works.
It works!
Wait.
Don't.
My God. What have you done?
No.
Don't.
I'm glad you've repaired your engine.
Now you can go back home.
- Yes.
- I, too, am going back home.
You must keep your promise.
- What promise?
- You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I'm responsible for this flower.
Please. You promised.
You also forgot the fence.
It's a very nice muzzle and fence.
Thank you.
You're cold as ice.
Are you afraid?
Please leave me.
I can't.
I won't.
I don't want you to suffer.
I'll look as if I'm dead, but it won't be true.
It's just that it's too far to carry this body with me.
You understand, don't you?
This part of me will be like an old, abandoned shell.
There's nothing sad about old shells, is there?
My star is so small
I can't show you where it is.
I'm going back there now, but before
I do, I want to give you something.
All I want is to hear you laugh again.
You will hear me laugh.
More than you ever did before, because on one of those stars,
I'll be laughing, but you won't know which one.
So they'll all be laughing, all the stars.
It will be like a bell that's hanging from every star in the sky.
There now, that's all.
Little Prince
From who knows where
Was it a star?
Was it a prayer?
With every smile
You clear the air
So I can see
Oh, Little Prince
Don't take your smile
Away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Please, Little Prince
Don't take your smile away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Where are you?
I won't leave without you!
Oh, my God.
It never happened.
He wasrt here.
It never happened.
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
SOUND SO MANY TRUMPETS?
I'M NOT JEHOVAH.
WHY CAN'T A PRINCE
COME HOME WITHOUT A FUSS?
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE
HE IS A PRINCE, SIR.
OTHER PEOPLE CAN SNEAK IN
THE BACK WAY UNANNOUNCED,
WHICH IS HOW
IT SHOULD BE.
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?
OH, WAS
I SMILING, SIR?
JUST THE SUDDEN WARMTH
CRACKING MY FACE.
A PRINCE'S LOT IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A BORE.
YOUR FACE CRACKS
RATHER EASILY, DOESN'T IT?
NOW, YOU MARK
MY WORDS,
BEFORE YOU
CAN COUNT TO 10,
THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WITH THE ODIOUS PUNCTUALITY
OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S
MUCH VAUNTED,
RECENTLY INVENTED, HIDEOUSLY
IRRITATING CUCKOO CLOCK,
WILL COME OUR DEAR
AND LOYAL SUBJECT,
THE EVER-UNCTUOUS
LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN.
Man: 7!
HE'S IMPROVING.
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
HE'S GOING TO ACHIEVE
THE ELUSIVE
10-MINUTE MILE.
HA HA HA HA!
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
AH, WELCOME HOME.
WELCOME HOME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
MY LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN,
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE.
I AM COMMANDED BY
HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
YOUR FATHER,
AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN, YOUR MOTHER--
YES, YES, NOW,
DON'T TIRE YOURSELF,
I AM ACQUAINTED
WITH THEM.
HOW ARE MY
DOTING PARENTS?
THEIR MAJESTIES ARE NATURALLY
MOST ANXIOUS TO HEAR
SUCH GLAD TIDINGS
I FEEL SURE YOU BEAR
CONCERNING YOUR RECENT
ABSENCE FROM THE COURT.
NAMELY, THE MATTER
OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
AND BETROTHAL TO THE PRINCESS
SELINA OF CAROLSFELD.
INDEED, IN ANTICIPATION
OF SUCH WONDERFUL NEWS,
HIS MAJESTY THE KING
HAS DECIDED TO MAKE YOU
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID THE MARTYR.
WHICH IS USUALLY
AWARDED POSTHUMOUSLY.
A SUITABLE HONOR,
AS IT HAPPENS,
FOR THE MATTER OF MY BETROTHAL
IS VERY STATUS QUO.
I DID NOT FIND THE LADY OF
YOUR CHOICE TO BE MY CHOICE.
OH, BUT, SIR--
WE ARE RETURNED...
AS WE DEPARTED.
THE KING I'M SURE,
AND INDEED MY DEAR MAMA
WILL SHARE
YOUR NOTICEABLE GRIEF.
Chamberlain: INDEED, SIR,
THE WHOLE COURT WILL BE GRIEVED.
WELL, SO BE IT.
ANY SIMPLE PEASANT IS
AFFORDED THE ABILITY
IN LOVE...
TO WIN OR LOSE
WHILE I OF THE NOBILITY
AM ROBBED OF THE FACILITY
TO CHOOSE
ANY SERF OR SERVANT
CAN BY NATURAL SELECTION
ELECT HIMSELF A MATE
IF SHE'S AMENABLE
BUT DUE TO MY HIGH BREEDING,
I'M CONTINUALLY ACCEDING
TO DEMANDS
I FIND INCREASINGLY
UNTENABLE
ALL I ASK, AND IT'S A
SIMPLE ENOUGH REQUEST--
WELL, FOLLOW ME,
BY ALL MEANS, FOLLOW ME.
I WISH TO KNOW,
I DEMAND TO KNOW...
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
WHY CAN'T I LIVE
TWO ROLES?
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME PERFORM
ALL THE CLOYING AMENITIES TI
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME
BE A FREE AND HAPPY SOUL?</>
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
SPLIT MYSELF RIGHT IN HALF
THEN I COULD SATISFY
AND MOLLIFY
AND PACIFY AND QUALIFY
WHILE THE OTHER ME
WOULD HAVE
A HELL OF
A HEALTHY LAUGH, HA? '11
THE CUSTOM OF ROYALTY
IN REFERRING TO ONESELF
IS TO NATURALLY EMPLOY
THE ROYAL "WE“
"WE ARE VERY HAPPY" SI
Y, “WE ARE VERY SAD“ “I
“WE ARE BORED
AND SUFFER FROM ENNUI"
FOR A ROYAL PRINCE,
THERE'S NO SUCH WORD AS “ME"
IT'S ALWAYS "WE“
SO, RIGHTFULLY, I
SHOULD BE TWO on THREE
DON'T YOU AGREE?
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
PERHAPS NOT.
SO, I ASK MYSELF...
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
WHY CAN'T I PLAY
TWO PARTS?
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME ENDURE
THE APPALLING FORMALITIES
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME
HAVE A FREE
AND HAPPY HEART?
IF I COULD BE
TWO PEOPLE
LIFE WOULD NOT
PASS ME BY
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO PICK AND CHOOSE
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO WIN OR LOSE
AND MAYBE ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE...
BEFORE WE DIE!
DIE? WHO'S DIED?
AH! AT LAST!
OUR DEAR SON.
WE ARE... WE ARE...
WE'RE WHAT?
DELIGHTED.
YES, DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU RETURN.
OH!
AH, YES, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.
Prince: FATHER...
Chamberlain:
YOUR MAJESTY--
KNEEL, SIR.
FATHER.
I DO NOT WISH" IT WOULD
BE MOST INAPPROPRIATE...
YOUR MAJESTY, HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS HAS RETURNED--
OF COURSE HE'S RETURNED! YOU
GET MORE SENILE EVERY DAY.
I HAVE RETURNED,
FATHER--
NOW YOU' RE
CATCHING IT.
EMPTY-HANDED.
KNEEL, SIR.
FATHER, THIS IS
MOST EMIBARRASSING.
I COMMAND YOU
TO KNEEL, SIR!
I DON'T DESERVE IT.
I HAVEN'T EARNED IT.
NOBODY EARNS THIS.
IT'S GIVEN BECAUSE I AM
THE KING AND I LIKE IT.
WHERE'S MY SWORD?
AH! IT'S FAR
TOO HEAVY.
YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN WITH THE
CURSE OF THE WEAK WRISTS.
OH, I DO SO LOVE
A CEREMONY.
AH, THAT'S BETTER.
I DUB THEE--
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
SHOULDN'T THERE BE
SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
I HAVE IT HERE.
YOUR MAJESTY--FATHER,
DO WE--MUST I-- us, or COURSE,
YOU MUST. AHEM!
“LET IT BE KNOWN
TO ALL HERE PRESENT
“THAT BY OUR COMMAND
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
“THE PRINCE
EDWARD CHARLES
"ALBERT GEORGE JAMES
RICHARD AUGUSTUS PHILIP
HAS RECEIVED
OUR GRACIOUS FAVOR.“
ER... WHO WROTE THIS?
YOU DID, SIRE.
AH, YES, WELL,
IT'S MAGNIFICENT STUFF.
WELL WORTH
PAYING ATTENTION TO.
“FROM THIS DAY HENCEFORTH
SHALL BE ENTITLED
"TO BE KNOWN AS
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF
SAINT DAVID THE BLESSED MARTYR. "
THERE'S... SOMEBODY
IN THE ROOM!
VERY FINE. NOW I KISS
YOU ON BOTH CHEEKS.
THAT'S THE PART
I LIKE BEST.
I SOMETIMES GIVE MEDALS
TO A WHOLE REGIMENT.
GOOD. VERY
TOUCHING CEREMONY.
Chamberlain:
MOST TOUCHING, SIRE.
SYCOPHANT!
DON'T ALWAYS HAVE
TO AGREE, YOU KNOW.
CONGRATULATIONS,
DEAR COUSIN.
OH, LORD!
WHO LET HIM IN?
CONGRATULATIONS !
I HEARD ALL THE TRUMPETS.
NOW, DON'T YOU START.
OH! A LITTLE
PREMATURE, AM I?
I SAY, HAVE I DROPPED THE
TINIEST OF SOCIAL BRICKETTES?
I MEAN, I WAS BEING
QUITE SINCERE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, AS
SINCERE AS I EVER AM.
OH, no!
WHO IS IT? HAS THERE BEEN
AN UPRISING?
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. IT'S
JUST THE DUKE OF MONTAGUE.
IS HE STILL ALIVE?
I THOUGHT WE BURIED HIM.
FATHER, EVER SINCE
I ENTERED THIS ROOM,
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT
WHAT YOU EXPECTED OF ME
DID NOT TAKE PLACE.
MY THROW, I THINK.
No, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE CHEATING AGAIN.
KINGS NEVER CHEAT. THEY
ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES,
BUT THEY NEVER CHEAT.
IF I MAY, SIR,
BY roux LEAVE,
THIS THING
IS CHOKING ME.
YOU SEE HOW
I'M PLACED?
ACCUSED IN FRONT OF THE
COURT BY MY OWN WIFE.
FATHER,
THIS IS SERIOUS.
OF COURSE,
IT' S SERIOUS.
I SHALL PROBABLY
CONCEDE THE GAME.
IT'S A ROYAL PREROGATIVE
TO BE UNSPORTING.
NEVER CONCEDE.
I THROW.
BLACK 5 !
THE MATCH, FATHER, WAS OF
YOUR MAKING NOT OF MINE.
EVEN So,
AS A DUTIFUL SON,
I JOURNEYED FAR
BEYOND OUR BORDERS
TO PAY MY RESPECTS
TO THE LADY AND...
SEE FOR MYSELF.
AND SHE WAS FAIR,
WAS SHE NOT?
INDEED, SIR. PERHAPS
PALE RATHER THAN FAIR.
A SICKLY LADY, SIR,
GIVEN TO MUCH SWOONING
AND... AND VAPORS.
ALL LADIES SWOON. THEY KNOW
IT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.
SOME SWOON
MORE THAN OTHERS, SIR,
AND SWOONING TO EXCESS IS NOT
A QUALITY I GREATLY ADMIRE.
SHE REFUSED YOU? IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
No, FATHER,
SHE COULD NOT REFUSE ME
BECAUSE I DID NOT OFFER.
YOU PERHAPS PLACED
TOO MUCH TRUST
IN THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS
OF CAROLSFELD.
THE LIKENESS
WAS No LIKENESS.
INDEED, SINCE YOU FORCE ME
TO THE DISCOURTESY,
THE LADY WAS BALD, SIR.
HER GOLDEN TRESSES FALSE!
HER MOUTH CRABBED WITH AGE, SIR,
AND DEVOID OF TEETH!
IN SHORT, SIR, SHE LEFT
MUCH TO BE DESIRED.
EXTRAORDINARY '.
FATHER,
IT'S A SMALL THING
AND DOUBTLESS
VERY IRRITATING TO YOU
BUT WHEN I MARRY,
AS NEEDS I MUST ONE DAY,
IT WILL BE FOR THE
CONVENIENCE OF LOVE,
RATHER THAN THE CONVENIENCE
OF... CONVENIENCE.
LOVE?
DID HE SAY LOVE?
HA HA!
HOW ABSURD.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
WHY SHOULD LOVE ENTER
INTO IT AT ALL?
LOVE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE EMOTIONALLY
HARRIED WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED
IT'S PEDANTIC
AND ROMANTIC FOLDEROL
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,

PRINCESS KATE

LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
I DISAGREE.
YOU DISAGREE?
HOW CAN YOU
DISAGREE, DEAR?
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT US.
Us, HA HA!
LOOK AT us.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO
DO WITH BEING MARRIED?
BEING MARRIED IS
A PROBLEM ALL ITS OWN
LOVE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED AND
MAKES MARRIAGE COMPLICATED
WHEN THE BED IS
ELEVATED TO THE THRONE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
PICK THE PROPER PRINCESS
PRIMIED TO PROPAGATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
THERE IS MANY
AN ELIGIBLE MAIDEN
OF GOOD FAMILY
WITH TITLE OF HER OWN
WHO WOULD COME TO US
BOUNTIFULLY BELADEN
WITH AN ARMY THAT COULD
FORTIFY OUR THRONE
UNCLE!
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID
THAT BETTER MYSELF.
WELL, I COULD,
AND IN FACT,
I THINK I WILL.
WHAT HAS MARRIAGE GOT TO DO
WITH BEING HAPPY?
BEING MARRIED CAN'T COMPARE
WITH BEING ROYAL
BEING ROYAL YOU ENGENDER
EVERY LUXURY AND SPLENDOR
WHILE A MARRIAGE
CAN GET OVERRIPE AND SPOIL
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE
WHY PROCRASTINATE
UH-UH!

OH, HAVE I MADE
A LITTLE FAUX PAS?
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF.

THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY
UNLESS YOU NAME
THE DAY.
LISTEN, LEND AN EAR.
I SAY AGAIN...
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
Queen: WHAT HAS BREAD
GOT TO DO WITH WEDDING CAKE?
WE ARE BORED WITH YOUR
DEFIANCE OF CONNUBIAL ALLIANCE
FOR A LINE OF ROYAL GIANTS
IS AT STAKE

Woman: OH, WHAT A RELIEF

HELP ME, MY DARLINGS. MY
FINGERS ARE POSITIVELY NUMB.
Girl: MAMA, DIDN'T
YOU THINK THE VICAR WAS--
Woman: GIRLS,
GIRLS, GIRLS.
CAN YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT SQUABBLING?
BLACK WAS NEVER
MY COLOR.
Girl :
So UNBECOMING.
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S
So YOUNG AND PRETTY.
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING, CHILD?
TO MY ROOM,
STEPMOTHER.
YOUR ROOM?
Girls : HER ROOM!
Stepmother: ALL THE ROOMS
IN THIS HOUSE ARE MINE NOW.
YOUR FATHER,
M'! LATE HUSBAND,
SADLY MISSED BY
US ALL,
IS DEAD, CHILD.
DEAD AND BURIED
BENEATH THE SNOW
IN THE SAME GRAVE
AS YOUR DEAR MOTHER.
THAT IS A DOUBLE MISFORTUNE
FOR YOU.
AND NOW YOU MUST START
A NEW LIFE.
YOUR FATHER, AS A TOKEN OF
HIS GREAT LOVE FOR ME,
SAW FIT TO MAKE A WILL
PLACING YOU IN MY CARE
AND PROTECTION.
MY FATHER
NEVER LOVED YOU.
YOU TRICKED HIM.
HOW DARE YOU, MADAM!
YOU TRICKED HIM!
WELL...
WELL IF I DID,
HE DID NOT LIVE
TO RUE THE DAY, DID HE?
AND NOW YOU CAN CURB
YOUR TONGUE;
CULTIVATE HUMILITY,
KNOW YOUR PRESENT PLACE.
I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU ALL.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME, GIRL,
AND HEAR ME WELL!
BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN A WIDOWS TEARS,
AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SHED
ENOUGH OF THOSE.
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
OF MY OWN TO SUPPORT,
WHICH SITUATION
HAS FORCED ME
TO MAKE CERTAIN ECONOMIES
IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
IS THAT NOT SO, GIRLS?
YES, MAMA.
CERTAIN DRASTIC
ECONOMIES, MAMA.
EXACTLY.
BUT BEING A WOMAN
OF PRINCIPLE,
I SHALL HONOR YOUR
FATHER'S LAST WISHES
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD
BELOW STAIRS!
AND DO NOT THINK YOU WILL
FIND SYMPATHY WITH THE STAFF.
THE STAFF
HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.
YOU ARE NOW THE STAFF.
TO TAKE ORDERS
INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM.
MOSTLY FROM US.
NEVER.
OH, YES.
YOU WILL COOK
AND YOU WILL CARRY.
YOU WILL FETCH
AND YOU WILL MEND.
YOUR FATHER'S WILL
ALLOWS AND THE LAW UPHOLDS.
So, TAKE YOUR PICK,
EITHER ACCEPT
YOUR LOT
OR Go TO
THE ORPHANAGE.
Stepsister: THEY TELL ME,
CINDERELLA,
ONE CAN BE
AWFULLY HAPPY THERE
AND VERY WARM.
THEY SLEEP
6 TO A BED.
NOT COUNTING
THE RATS.
DO NOT TEASE,
MY DARLINGS.
IT SPOILS
YOUR LOOKS.
NOW, YOUR FIRST TASK WILL
BE TO MAKE US SOME SOUP.
BURYING A HUSBAND
IS A COLD BUSINESS.
AND SADLY FOR ME,
I HAVE NOW BURIED TWO.
Girls: POOR MAMA!
GIVE ME
YOUR CLOAK, GIRL.
YOU WILL NOT BE NEEDING
IT DOWN THERE.
HURRY, GIRL, HURRY!
AND DO NOT KEEP US
WAITING FOR THE SOUP.
COME ALONG, MY DOVES, WE
MUST REARRANGE THE ROOMS.
Stepsister: OH, MAMA,
MAY I HAVE CINDERELLA'S ROOM?
Second stepsister: No, MAMA,
YOU PROMISED ME FIRST PICK.
SHE ALWAYS HAS EVERYTHING--
MY DARLINGS...
EVERYTHING WILL BE FAIRLY
DIVIDED. NOW, COME ALONG.
I'M THE ELDEST, AND I
SHOULD HAVE FIRST CHOICE.
SHE MAY BE THE ELDEST,
BUT I'M MAMA'S FAVORITE.
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
OH, MAMA, sun's so BEASTLY!
Stepmother: LITTLE STEPS,
GIRLS, LITTLE STEPS.
ONCE I WAS LOVED

EDUCATIOH, YOU SEE.
I WAS ONLY KNEE-HIGH

THEY STOOD ME IN FRONT OF THIS
AND THEY SAID,
"THAT'S YOURS.
THAT'S WAITING FOR YOU. "
VERY CHEERFUL !
HUMOR WAS NEVER
THE FAMILY'S STRONG POINT.
I WASN'T FRIGHTENED.
I WAS INTRIGUED.
I SEE THEY'VE EVEN PUT
YOUR NAME ON IN ADVANCE.

WHO WAS THAT?
SIR?
THE GIRL. THERE.
SHE WAS HIDING
THERE.
I SAW NO ONE, SIR.
I COULD HAVE SWORN.
A SERVANT GIRL.
SO, MADAM, YOU ARE
RETURNED AT LAST!
YOU WICKED GIRL,
HOW DARE YOU DISOBEY ME.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I ONLY WENT...
YES?
TO MY PARENTS'
GRAVE, STEPMOTHER,
TO PUT
SOME FLOWERS THERE.
HOW TOUCHING...
WITH FLOWERS
FROM MY GARDEN,
STOLEN FLOWERS !
NO.
I SAY YES !
I SAY YOU STOLE THEM.
YOU'RE NOT ONLY
A LIAR BUT A THIEF,
AND THIEVES WE KNOW
MUST BE PUNISHED.
COME !
THIS IS YOUR PLACE,
AND THERE
IS YOUR TASK.
WE ARE EXPECTING GUESTS
FOR DINNER TONIGHT...
IMPORTANT GUESTS.
AND FOR REPAYING MY KINDNESS
WITH CUNNING AND DECEIT,
HENCEFORTH, YOU WILL NOT DARE
TO VENTURE FROM THIS ROOM
WITHOUT MY SAYING.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
YES, STEPMOTHER.
THEN MAKE A START
AND MAKE AMENDS.
Prince: JOHN,
TELL ME SOMETHING.
HAVE YOU EVER WISHED
YOU WERE IN LOVE?
OH, YES.
OFTEN? I MEAN,
AS OFTEN AS I WISH IT?
WELL...
WELL, I AM IN LOVE.
YOU ARE? HOW AMAZING.
WHO IS SHE?
THE LADY CAROLINE,
SIR, SINCE YOU ASK.
WHAT? THE LADY-IN-WAITING
TO MY GRANDMOTHER?
THAT LADY CAROLINE?
YES.
HOW AMAZING!
WM.
WELL, IT' S EXTRAORDINARY.
NOT EXTRAORDINARILY
EXTRAORDINARY, OF COURSE,
BUT I NEVER GUESSED.
HEH, HEH. I KNOW.
WELL, I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU HAVE M'! BLESSING.
I - I - I MUST
CONGRATULATE HER.
No! No, PLEASE, SIR.
DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S KIND OF YOU, BUT
IT WOULDN'T BE SEEMLY.
HOW SO?
ALAS, MY CAUSE
IS A LOST ONE.
WELL, THE LADY DOES NOT
RETURN YOUR AFFECTIONS?
OH, INDEED! BUT THE FACT
REMAINS THAT I AM WHAT I AM:
A SERVANT!
POSITIOH, SIR.
POSITION.
JOHN, I'M TWICE AMAZED.
I MUST BE VERY DENSE.
AM I?
OF COURSE NOT. YOU
HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS;
I HAVE MINE.
King: WHERE ARE WE?
THAT's US?
YOU'RE SURE THIS MAP'S
BEEN DRAWN TO SCALE?
I BELIEVE SO,
YOUR MAJESTY.
THEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN
LOOKING AT ALL THESE YEARS?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS US.
I ALWAYS GO BY
THE BROWN PARTS FOR THE LAND
AND THE BLUE PARTS
FOR THE SEA.
WHO'S THAT?
FIRST LORD OF
THE NAVY, SIRE.
HAVE WE GOT A NAVY?
THE ROYAL BARGE
ON THE LAKE?
OH, YES, YES.
WELL, REMIND ME NOT
TO TRAVEL IN IT AGAIN.
King: SO, EVEN ALLOWING FOR
ERRORS IN THE CARTOGRAPHER'S ART,
WE ARE SMALL IN COMPARISON
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.
THOUGH GREAT IN, AHH,
WHAT'S THE WORD?
ER, TRADITION?
TRADITIOH, YES. GREAT
IN TRADITION AND SPIRIT,
IN FACT, WE ARE SMALL.
HEAR, HEAR.
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN!
NOW, YOU'RE ALL AWARE
OF THE PROBLEMS
OF MY SON'S RELUCTANCE TO
HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD WIFE
CHOSEN FOR HIM.
THIS GENERATION HAS
No RESPECT AT ALL.
I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED OFF
BEFORE I WAS 14!
CAROLSFELD - -WHERE'S THAT?
AH, YOU SEE, THE SIZE OF IT,
SEE THE SIZE OF IT. PERFECT.
NOW, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?
WITH RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,
I HAVE PREPARED
A SMALL PAPER.
WHAT I AM SEEKING
IS A PROPER BALANCE,
WEIGHING
WHAT WE SACK
AGAINST WHAT
WE HAVE TO OFFER.
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES, STOP TALKING
IN THOSE BORING, DIPLOMATIC RIDDLES.
SPEAK THE KING'S
EUPHRANIAN, MAN!
FORGIVE ME, YOUR MAJESTY.
I HAD IN MIND A CELEBRATION.
King: WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO CELEBRATE?
A MARRIAGE, SIRE.
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?
HMM. FINALLY
GOT RID OF HER, EH?
WELL, NOT MY MARRIAGE, SIRE.
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE PRINCE EDWARD'S.
WELL, WE'D ALL LIKE
TO CELEBRATE THAT.
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M
SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF IDIOTS.
HERE WE ARE, HEDGED
IN BY HOSTILE FORCES,
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THOUGHT OF.
SIRE, THIS TIME,
I HAVE A NEW IDEA,
AN IDEA THAT THE PRINCE HIMSELF
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST!
WELL, MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S GOT TEETH.
HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION
ABOUT THEM HAVING TEETH.
I THOUGHT, A BALL!
A BALL?
A GREAT BALL !
THE GREATEST BALL THAT
HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN, SIRE.
AND TO IT, WE WILL INVITE EVERY
ELIGIBLE PRINCESS IN EUROPE,
AND EVEN BEYOND,
YOUR MAJESTY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT IDEA?
I REMEMBER MY FIRST BALL.
YES, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO Go
INTO THE REALMS OE FANTASY.
WHAT ELSE?
I HAVE PREPARED A LIST, your: MAJESTY,
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAKE SUCH PREPARATIONS
AS WOULD DAZZLE
OUR ENEMIES AND DMDE THEM,
FOR PROTOCOL WOULD NOT
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE WAR
WHILE THEY ARE GUESTS
IN OUR MIDST.
AND I REMAIN CONVINCED
THAT THE PRINCE, YOUR SON,
WILL DO HIS DUTY.
INDEED, FACE TO FACE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE ENTIRE COURT
HE COULD HARDLY FAIL
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.
General: THE OCCASION,
THE MUSIC, THE CANDLELIGHT,
THE SWIRLING DRESSES,
THE PERFUME,
THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE!
PUT HIM ON
THE RETIREMENT LIST.
I SHALL MAKE
A ROYAL DECISION!
TAKING THIS IDEA
AND IMPROVING ON IT,
WE MUST PLAN EVERY DETAIL.
NOBLESSE OBLIGE!
Chamberlain:
QUITE SO, YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIPLOMACY.
PROTOCOL!
YES, WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS WE RESPECT
MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
SIRE! PLEASE, SIRE.
WHEN ITS ARMY IS
BATTERED AND BROKEN
AND BACK TO ITS
BORDERS IT CRAWLS
TO WHAT CLINGS
A TOTTERING KINGDOM
IF NOT TO ITS PROTOCOLS?
AND WHEN THE TREASURY'S
TAPPED OF ITS TREASURES
ARE THE TAPESTRIES
STRIPPED FROM THE WALLS?
No, THE COURT CARRIES ON
WITH ITS PLEASURES
INQUISITIONS
AND BANQUETS AND BALLS
All: BUT THEY MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
HO, HO,
WELL-DONE, SIRE.
PRECEDENT!
WE NEED A BOOK THAT WILL
GIVE US CHAPTER AND VERSE.
IN THE LIBRARY--
IT'LL BE IN THE LIBRARY.
I BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY WITHIN
THE LIBRARY, YOUR MAJESTY.
WELL, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.
I KNEW THAT !
WHAT VOLUME
DO YOU SUGGEST?
THERE IS ONLY ONE,
YOUR MAJESTY, THE BIBLE.
BIBLE?! WELL, LET'S KEEP
RELIGION OUT OF IT.
NO, SIRE. I SHOULD
SAY IN THIS CASE,
THE BIBLE IS FORMS
AND ADDRESSES
FOR ROYAL OCCASIONS
B'! DE LYON.
AH.
NOW THEN,
LET ME SEE, SIRE...
ABDICATIONS,
DISMISSAL OF MINISTERS,
GARDEN PARTIES,
INVESTITURES...
JUDICIAL BEHEADINGS"
YES, SKIP ALL THAT.
YOUR MAJESTY, QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT PERTAINING
TO THE SEATING
OF CROWNED HEADS
IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.
AHH! WE SHOULD REHEARSE IT!
UH, YOU CAN BE
THE PRINCESS ESMERELDA,
EVER WILLING TO SERVE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
AND YOU THE DUCHESS
OF RAMBOUILLET,
AND YOU THE DAUGHTER OF
THE EMPEROR OF BRATISLAVA,
AND, UH... OH, THE REST OF YOU CAN
SORT IT OUT AMONGST YOURSELVES.
WHAT AN INSPIRED IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
IF THE DAUGHTER OF
THE DUCHESS OF SNARDEN
WERE TO BE SEATED BY
THE COUNTESS OF SNEAD
FOR THIS BREACH
OF DECORUM TO SNARDEN
THE INVASION
OF SNEAD WOULD PROCEED QI
AND SEAT THE HEIRESS
TO THE BARONY OF NEUBURG
BY THE SIDE OF HER
HATED COUSIN GWENN
OH, HOW QUICKLY
THE ARMIES OF NEUBURG
WOULD DEPLOY
TO DESTROY US AGAIN
All: SO WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
So WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
PROTOCOL

PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
WELL, NOW!
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME?
NO. I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYBODY.
FUNNY. YOU SHOULD
HAVE FELT SOMETHING.
I'M LOSING MY TOUCH.
COULD I COME IN AND REST
BY YOUR FIRE, PLEASE?
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
A LONG WAY.
WELL... I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO ANYBODY OR SEE ANYBODY,
BUT...
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO SHARE MY FIRE...
SUCH AS IT IS,
BUT I'D BE OBLIGED
IF YOU DIDN'T STAY TOO LONG.
PLEASE EXCUSE ME
IF I CARRY ON WORKING,
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH
THESE, AND I'M VERY SLOW.
YES! WELL, THERE ARE MORE WAYS
THAN ONE OF PEELING POTATOES.
THE FIRE SEEMS
TO HAVE CHEERED UP.
I COULD WARM YOU A LITTLE
BROTH IF YOU LIKE.
No, THANK YOU.
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT.
LIVE DOWN HERE on YOUR own, no YOU?
I DO NOW.
YES.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY
THEY WON'T CHANGE AGAIN.
I GET AROUND QUITE A BIT,
YOU KNOW.
MUST BE NICE TO TRAVEL.
YES AND No.
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD SETTLE IN ONE PLACE,
BUT THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME.
I'D LIKE SOMEWHERE COZY,
WITH A DOG TO KEEP ME COMPANY.
I EXPECT YOUR DOG IS
A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU.
MY DOG?
I HAVEN'T GOT A DOG.
ISN'T HE YOURS?
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?
HE CAME IN WHEN I CAME IN.
OH! OH, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU KEEP HIM?
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.
HE'S AN OLD HAND AT THAT.
OHH!
HE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.
OH, I LOVE HIM!
I'M JUST SO AFRAID OF WHAT
MY STEPMOTHER WILL SAY.
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!
THERE SHE IS,
AND I HAVEN'T FINISHED!
I'VE GOT TO HIDE YOU.
WELL, I'LL BE OFF.
I'VE SEEN WHAT I WANT TO SEE.
YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF HIM.
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!
I KNOW! I'LL HIDE
YOU UNDER HERE.
PROMISE NOT
TO MAKE A SOUND.
HAVE YOU BEEN
STRUCK DUMB, GIRL?
OH!
OH!
ANSWER ME WHEN I CALL.
YOU KNOW I HATE HAVING
TO RAISE M'! VOICE.
NOW, I HOPE YOU HAVE
BEEN HARD AT WORK. I...
I SEE.
WELL, UH...
UH, I SEE.
I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE
YOU MORE TO DO NEXT TIME.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT?
King: I WILL NOT HAVE
MY AUTHORITY FLOUTED
IN THIS FASHION.
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CUSTOM
FOR THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
TO TAKE A WIFE IN GOOD TIME.
AND YOU SHOW A STRANGE RELUCTANCE
TO COMPLY WITH TRADITION.
FATHER,
I EMPHATICALLY DISAGREE.
AND I TOTALLY REFUSE TO TAKE PART
IN SUCH AN EMBARRASSING CHARADE.
BUT I'VE DECREED IT!
THEN YOU MUST
UNDECREE IT.
IMPOSSIBLE !
YOU TALK TO HIM.
DEAREST BOY--
OH, MOTHER,
IT'S NO USE TRYING
TO GET ROUND ME
THAT WAY.
THE VERY IDEA
OF GIVING A BALL
AND INVITING A SELECTION
OF TITLED WALLFLOWERS
TO VIE FOR MY HAND
IS UTTERLY REPULSIVE!
DEGRADING
TO ALL CONCERNED.
IN MY DAY,
I NEVER HAD THE CHOICE!
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
ANY DIFFERENTLY, OF COURSE.
YOU TAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.
WELL I AM YOUR FATHER,
AND I AM THE KING!
IT'S LIKE SOME
SORDID BEAUTY CONTEST
WITH ME
AS THE GRAND PRIZE.
SINCE YOU WON'T GO TO MECCA,
MECCA MUST COME TO YOU!
Queen: YOU HAVE TO GET
MARRIED SOMEDAY, DEAR.
BUT NOT IN THIS WAY.
WELL, IT SEEMS PERFECTLY
REASONABLE TO ME.
WE'VE INVITED EVERY ELIGIBLE
PRINCESS IN THE ALMANAC.
AND IT'S A QUESTION OF DUTY!
FATHER, I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED
THAT IT IS MY BOUNDEN DUTY
TO TAKE A WIFE AND ENSURE
THE ROYAL SUCCESSION.
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BE
PARTY TO AND JUDGE A CATTLE SHOW!
WHOEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING?
CAP-CATTLE SHOW!
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WHERE EVERY MAIDEN'S
BOUND TO LAUGH AT ME
THE ROYAL
FATTED CALF
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
THOUGH I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE CHOOSING
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE LOSING
IT'S NAUSEATING,
NAUSEATING!
CAN'T YOU
JUST IMAGINE IT?
HOPE SPRINGS IN ALL
SHORT, FAT, OR TALL
AS THEY PRIMP
AND PREEN AND PRAY
THAT THIS WILL BE
THEIR LUCKY DAY
THERE IS NO AFFAIR
OF WHICH I'M AWARE
MORE GALLING TO BEAR
THAN A BRIDE-FINDING BALL
Montague:
I JUST HEARD THE NEWS!
King: OH,
WHO LET HIM IN?
IS IT TRUE, DEAR UNCLE?
THE TATTLE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVITE A WHOLE NURSERY
OF NUBILE DELICACIES
TO A BALL.
SOME OTHER TIME, NEPHEW.
WE'RE BUSY NOW.
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.
YOU JUST CAN'T, UNCLE.
I MEAN, I REALIZE THAT
I WON'T HAVE FIRST PICK,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
BECAUSE I'M NOT PROUD.
I'M JUST DESPERATE.
WE'RE ALL DESPERATE!
SO IT'S TRUE, THEN!
OH, HOW EXCITING!
NOW, I MUST DECIDE
WHAT TO WEAR.
HIGH HEELS, I THINK, TO
GIVE ME ADDED STATURE.
THE MOMENT YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE,
I SHALL UNLEASH MYSELF.
I'VE ALREADY MADE
MY CHOICE, COUSIN.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
PICK OF THE LOT.
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
YOU CAN'T BE SUCH
A SPOILSPORT! I MEAN...
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WHERE LUSCIOUS LOVELIES
FROM EACH LAND
WILL VIE TO WIN
THE ROYAL HAND
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WITH FRILLS ON TRESSES,
PARTY DRESSES
EVERY MAIDEN EFFERVESCES
GIVING HER BEST
GVING HER ALL
DANCING, GLANCING,
LAUGHING, TEASING
WHIRLING, SWIRLING
TOUCHING, SQUEEZING
THERE'S NO AFFAIR
TO EVER COMPARE
OR THRILL OR ENTHRALL
LIKE A BRIDE-FINDING BALL
Chamberlain: YOUR MAJESTY.
King: WELL, WHAT IS IT?
I BRING GRAVE TIDINGS.
CAROLSFELD HAS MOBILIZED.
THERE IS TALK OF WAR.
WAR?!
WAR?!
WAR.
WAR.
AS YOUR MAJESTY'S
SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE,
IT IS MY SOLEMN DUTY TO ADVISE YOU
THAT THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL.
THE NEWS THAT HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS SAW FIT TO DECLINE
THE HAND OF THE
PRINCESS SELINA IN MARRIAGE,
WAS ILL-RECEIVED.
TRUE.
TRUE.
EDWARD, M'! sou...
I BESEECH YOU NOT AS A
FATHER BUT AS YOUR MONARCH.
RECONSIDER BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
PUT ASIDE YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY LOOKS TO
YOU TO FORM AN ALLIANCE
THROUGH
THE MARRIAGE BED.
AND DO AS I DID WHEN
I TOOK YOUR MOTHER.
I CLOSED MY EYES AND
THOUGHT OF EUPHRANIA.
Chamberlain: BRATISLAVA!
WILDENSTEIN!
NEUBURG !
OH!
OH!
AAH!
UHH!
King: HOW MANY
DOES THAT MAKE?
WELL, YOUR MAJESTY, OF THE
COURIERS WHO RETURNED,
6 HAVE REPORTED
ACCEPTANCES.
IN ADDITIOH, THERE
WERE 5 REFUSALS.
ONE OF THEM COUCHED IN
THE MOST OBSCENE TERMS.
TWO OF THOSE
INVITED WERE DEAD,
AND THE REMAINING 3
COULD NOT BE TRACED.
THAT MAKES 6 OUT OF 16.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A FAIR AVERAGE, DON'T YOU?
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
PERHAPS NOT QUITE
THE BREADTH OF CHOICE
WE AT FIRST ENVISAGED.
WELL, INVITE ALL LOCAL
NOBILITY AS WELL.
WE DON'T WANT
THE PLACE HALF EMPTY.
WE CAN ALWAYS RAISE
THE TAXES TO PAY FOR IT.
IN FACT, I'LL INVENT A NEW TAX,
A TAX ON SNOBBERY.
THEY'LL ALL PAY THAT.
BRILLIANT, YOUR MAJESTY!
BRILLIANT!
DON'T OVER DO IT.
DON'T OVER DO IT.
YOU'LL BE PAYING IT, TOO.
Stepmother: GIRLS! GIRLS!
ISOBELLA! PALATINE!
Isobella and Palatine:
RIGHT HERE, MAMA!
COME QUICKLY!
WHAT IS IT, MAMA?
WONDERFUL NEWS.
WE HAVE RECEIVED A ROYAL
INVITATION TO A BALL
IN HONOR OF HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRINCE!
OH, MAMA, BUT--
NOW, NOW, NOW,
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
YOU MIGHT TEAR IT,
AND I WANT
TO HAVE IT FRAMED.
OH, I THINK
IT'S SO EXCITING,
I SHALL HAVE THE VAPORS!
HOW SHALL I HAVE
MY HAIR?
OH, WHAT SHALL I WEAR?
THERE IS WORK
TO BE DONE.
WE HAVE NOT
A MOMENT TO LOSE.
WHAT CAN WE WEAR?!
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
SOMETHING NEW.
YES. I MEAN, NONE OF MY
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
LET US GO AND SEE.
OH! CAN YOU NEVER DO
A JOB PROPERLY, GIRL?
LOOK AT ALL THAT DIRTY WATER.
YOU HAD BETTER DO
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE AGAIN!
COME, GIRLS!
MAMA I THINK PALATINE
SHOULD WEAR A BROWN DRESS.
Palatine:
YOU SPITEFUL CREATURE!
YOU SHOULD WEAR GREEN
TO MATCH YOUR COMPLEXION.
Isobella: OH, MAMA!
BUT THE PRESTIGE, YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRESTIGE!
IT WILL PUT
EUPHRANIA ON THE MAP.
UH, PIN THERE, IDIOT.
NOT THERE, THERE.
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
FINE, FINE, FINE.
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.
I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.
NOW LEAVE US, PLEASE.
OH, JOHN!
WHAT HAVE
I LET MYSELF IN FOR?
A LITTLE MORE
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE.
AND WHO KNOWS?
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE ONE TO
WHOM YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HEART.
WILL YOU DANCE
WITH YOUR LADY CAROLINE?
ALAS, NOT DONE, SIR.
OH, YES, HOW STUPID OF ME.
I WAS FORGETTING.
NOT IN 20 YEARS!
WE'RE SOLD OUT!
MY CHOICEST BROCADES!
Stepmother: SOLD OUT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU RIDICULOUS MAN?
HOW CAN YOU BE SOLD OUT
WHEN WE HAVE NOT
PURCHASED ANYTHING?
THE BALL, GRACIOUS LADY.
I'D SCARCELY OPENED ME DOORS THIS
MORNING WHEN THEY DESCENDED!
WHO? WHO DESCENDED?
EVERYBODY, MI LADY !
THEY CAME LIKE
THE HERON TO THE POOL,
TAKING EVERYTHING I HAD.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.
YOU, MY GOOD MAN, SHOULD
LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN RIFFRAFF AND PEOPLE
OF CONSEQUENCE, LIKE US.
WHAT SHALL WE DO?
Stepmother:
COACHMAN, DRIVE US HOME.
GIRLS, DO STOP PULLING
THOSE DREADFUL FACES.
I'M IN A BAD ENOUGH
MOOD AS IT IS.
IDIOT!
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
SHE'S SO BEASTLY TO ME!
CINDERELLA!
CINDERELLA! WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL YOU?
COME OVER HERE. I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU TO DO.
TAKE THESE, UNPICK THEM, AND MAKE 3
SPLENDID NEW DRESSES OUT OF THEM.
OH, MAMA, YOU'RE SO CLEVER.
MAKE SURE THEY FIT
TO PERFECTION.
NOW START IMMEDIATELY.
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT
TO LOSE.
BE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN
BEFORE YOU START SEWING.
AND WE'RE TO LOOK
AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE.
AH, WELL, AS PRETTY
AS WE ARE!
WE MUST ALL BE
UTTERLY SPLENDID.
SO RUN ALONG, CHILD.
START AT ONCE!
YES...
UTTERLY... SPLENDID!
BUT ALREADY,
HIS HEART WAS--
OH, HENRIETTA, no STOP GRUMBLING.
HIS HEART WAS
BURNING WITH... LOVE
AS IF IT HAD BEEN LAID
ON RED HOT GOALS!
YOU LIKE THAT?
So DO I.
SIT DOWN, DEAR.
DON'T DO THAT.
AT THIS POINT, SCHEHERAZADE
SAW THE APPROACH OF MORNING
AND FELL SILENT.
AS WELL SHE MIGHT.
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
SET YOUR FRIENDS OFF.
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT FEEDING.
NO REST, NO PEACE.
WELL... SEE IF YOU LIKE THIS.
YOU'LL FALL.
HANSEL, GRETEL...
IS THAT
THE WRONG WAY ROUND?
WHO'S THAT?
OH, IT'S YOU, IS IT?
OH, DON'T WIPE
YOUR PAWS, WILL YOU!
I'VE GOT NOBODY TO HELP
ME CLEAN, YOU KNOW.
I HAVE TO DO ALL MYSELF.
DO YOU REALIZE THAT TIRESOME SCHEHERAZADE
IS BARELY HALFWAY THROUGH HER 1,001 NIGHTS?
I HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER
496 TALES BEFORE SHE'S SAFE.
AND M'! DIARY IS CHOCK-A-BLOCK.
LOOK! WEDNESDAY, A SEA JOURNEY TO
TAKE CARE OF A LITTLE MERMAID.
FRIDAY... OH, THE UGLY
DUCKLING'S DUE TO HATCH.
WELL, I HAVE TO BE
BACK FOR THAT.
OH, DO BE QUIET, HENRIETTA.
I CAN'T THINK!
NOW, WHAT'S THAT?
AH! A NEW KEY CUT
FOR PANDORA' S BOX.
WELL, IT'S ALL VERY WELL
FOR HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN
TO SAY HIS LIFE
IS A FAIRY STORY.
MINE ISN'T.
NOTHING! ONE LONG SLOG!
I CAN DO ALL MANNER OF THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT NEVER ANYTHING FOR MYSELF.
WATCH! YOU'D LIKE A BONE.
SIMPLE. THERE YOU ARE.
LET ME TRY IT FOR MYSELF.
WOULD I LIKE A CUP OF TEA?
YES, I WOULD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW WATCH THIS.
KETTLE, BOIL.
SEE? DISASTER.
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO CINDERELLA?
HOW FUNNY.
I WAS JUST WISHING--
YES. I KNOW.
DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE
A VERY RUDE COMMENT?
THESE ARE HOPELESS.
THEY'RE WORSE
THAN HOPELESS.
I'VE RUINED THEM.
I'M GOING TO GET
INTO SUCH TROUBLE.
NOW, WE DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT.
DRY YOUR TEARS
AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.
HMM. YOU LOOK
HALF-STARVED AND WORN OUT.
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING TO EAT.
I WAS TOO BUSY DOING
THOSE TO COOK ANYTHING.
WHAT'S THAT, THEN?
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?
AND WHERE DID
YOU COME FROM?
I DON' T UNDERSTAND.
NO. WELL, VERY FEW PEOPLE DO.
YOU'RE NOT MEANT
TO UNDERSTAND IT.
YOU'RE MEANT
TO ACCEPT IT GRACIOUSLY.
NOW, LOOK.
I'M A VERY BUSY WOMAN,
AND I SOMETIMES--
SOMETIMES LACK TACT.
THE FIRST THING YOU MUST LEARN IN
LIFE IS NEVER TO GO BY APPEARANCES.
THINGS ARE NEVER QUITE
WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE.
DO EAT UP; THAT'S
ONE OF MY BEST RECIPES.
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.
I'M NOT WHAT I SEEM.
MIND YOU, I DON'T
DRESS THE PART
AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON.
HUMAN NATURE--OH, WELL,
WE WON'T GO INTO WHAT
I THINK OF HUMAN NATURE,
BUT IF I WERE TO Go ABOUT MY
BUSINESS ALL SPARKLE AND GLITTER,
QUITE APART
FROM LOOKING ABSURD"
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT THEY WRITE
IN THOSE STORYBOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
IT'S A MOST UNSUITABLE
COSTUME FOR A GROWN WOMAN--
I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT
THE WORTHY FROM THE UNWORTHY.
DON' T YOU AGREE?
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I'M A... FAIRY GODMOTHER.
HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE.
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK
HOW I GOT INTO IT,
BECAUSE IT'S A LONG STORY.
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE...
AND I SOMETIMES WISH
WE'D NEVER BEEN INVENTED.
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU?
NOT ENOUGH TO GO ROUND,
JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
OF WORK I HAVE TO DO.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
DELICIOUS.
IT'S THE SAUCE, YOU KNOW.
THAT OLD WIZARD MICHELIN
GAVE ME THE SECRET
IN RETURN FOR 3 OF MY MAGIC
KNIVES AND FORKS. WHERE WAS I?
YES! WELL, I HAVE
TO PUT PEOPLE TO THE TEST.
NOW, YOU PASSED THE TEST.
THOSE-THAT UNHOLY TRIO UPSTAIRS
I SIMPLY DIDN'T BOTHER WITH.
NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.
HOWEVER, TO WORK.
BEST THAT YOU CAN DO
IS GET A GOOD NIGHTS REST.
NO'! YOU.
I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.
WM.
AH. LET ME CONCENTRATE.
WHAT ARE THEY WEARING
IN PARIS THESE DAYS?
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH FASHION.
WELL, HAVE YOU GOT
ANY IDEAS?
OH, CONCENTRATE.
CONCENTRATE.
Stepmother: OF COURSE,
IT IS NOT WHAT I AM USED TO,
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE MADE A
REASONABLE JOB OF STITCHING THIS.
Palatine: I'M MAM'SA FAVORITE,
AND SHE PROMISED ME FIRST.
GIRLS, IT IS
TIME TO LEAVE!
WE MUST NOT KEEP
THE PRINCE WAITING.
MAMA, I'VE JUST BEEN
TELLING PALATINE
THAT SHE'S NOT TO
FEEL JEALOUS
IF THE PRINCE ASKS
ME TO DANCE FIRST.
OH, MAMA!
SHH.
CINDERELLA,
STRAIGHTEN THAT HEM.
Palatine: HOW DO
I LOOK, MAMA?
DON'T I LOOK SUPERB?
YOU BOTH LOOK
RAVISHING.
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR
POOR MAMA TO OUTSHINE YOU.
WELL!
COME, LET US DEPART.
CLEAR UP THE MESS IN MY
BEDROOM, CINDERELLA.
I DO NOT WANT TO COME HOME
AND FIND IT ALL UNTIDY.
Cinderella:
HAVE A NICE TIME.
Stepmother: YOU MAY
DEPEND ON THAT!
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
WE LOOK WONDERFUL.
Isabella: WELL, I DO.
Stepmother:
COME, GIRLS.
Man: YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HER SERENE HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS MARIA OF TUSCANY.
THE GRAND DUCHESS SOFIA
ELIZABETH OF DIETRICHSTEIN.
HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
PRINCESS ALEXANDRE.
OH, WHY NOT?
I'LL JUST MAKE TIME.
YES. YES,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
SITTING ALL ALONE FEELING
SORRY FOR OURSELVES, ARE WE?
WELL, THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE, I SUPPOSE,
THOUGH I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR
THESE ROYAL OCCASIONS MYSELF--
TOO FORMAL, AND NOT
ENOUGH TO EAT OR DRINK.
STILL, I DARESAY IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS YOU'D LIKE TO GO.
GO?
ME Go TO THE BALL?
WELL, OF COURSE.
THAT WHAT YOU WERE
WISHING, ISN'T IT?
NOT WISHING,
EXACTLY,
BUT THINKING WHAT
IT MUST BE LIKE.
SAME THING.
NOW, LISTEN. I HAVEN'T GOT
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME,
BECAUSE I'M SIMPLY RUN
OFF MY FEET THESE DAYS--
WHAT A
MISERABLE FIRE.
YOU SHALL Go
TO THE BALL.
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T
STRETCHED EVERYTHING TOO FAR
AND THAT I CAN
MAKE IT WORK.
MY POWERS ARE NOT
UNLIMITED, YOU KNOW.
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.
OH, I HAVE TO
SHARE THEM OUT.
NOW, LET ME THINK.
YES, I CAN BORROW
A BIT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
RIGHT.
NOW.
YOU !
OUTSIDE.
HEY, I SHALL NEED YOU,
So OFF YOU Go.
OH, AND YOU.
TAKE THEM WITH YOU, DOG,
AND SEE IF YOU CAN ROUND UP
A FROG OR A LIZARD.
NOW, THEN, I MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK, THIS,
BUT THEN,
I HAVE BEEN LUCKY.
OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR!
MOST UNSUITABLE
FOR A BALL.
YES.
YES, IT IS.
WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO Go AS YOU ARE.
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
HOW DO YOU DO IT?
WELL, THAT'S
A TRADE SECRET,
BUT IT HELPS
IF YOU DREAM.
IF YOU DREAM...
SUDDENLY
'SUDDENLY IT HAPPENS
AND THE DREAM COMES TRUE
WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY IT HAPPENS
AND YOUR WORLD IS NEW
X MAGICALLY ﬂ
YOU'RE HOLDING
THE GOLDEN PRIZE
MYSTICALLY

SUDDENLY
DIZZILY YOU'RE SPINNING
WITH THE THRILL OF LIFE
SUDDENLY
'THIRSTILY YOU'RE DRINKING IN

K BUT SECRETS)! ﬂ
YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S TRUE
AND WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY ﬂ
SUDDENLY
IT HAPPENS TO YOU
CINDERELLA.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I JUST CAN'T
BELIEVE IT!
OH.
MY STEPMOTHER
AND MY STEPSISTERS"
THEY'LL RECOGNIZE ME.
No ONE WILL RECOGNIZE
YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE.
PEOPLE SELDOM DO.
BUT HOW
SHALL I BEHAVE?
I'M DRESSED LIKE
A PRINCESS.
OH, JUST BE
YOURSELF.
AND FOR TONIGHT,
YOU ARE A PRINCESS--
THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.
BUT I MUST
WARN YOU--
AND TAKE HEED, FOR IT
IS A SOLEMN WARNING--
THE MAGIC I HAVE CONJURED HERE
TONIGHT IS BORROWED MAGIC.
ON THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT,
YOU MUST RETURN IT.
OTHERWISE, EVERYTHING
I HAVE TRANSFORMED
WILL CHANGE BACK TO
ITS ORIGINAL STATE.
Chorus: SUDDENLY
DIZZILY YOU'RE SPINNING
WITH THE THRILL OF LIFE
SUDDENLY
THIRSTILY YOU'RE SPINNING WITH
THE THRILL OF LIFE
BUT SECRETLY
YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S TRUE
WHEN
WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY ﬂ
SUDDENLY

OFF YOU Go,
AND ENJOY YOURSELF.
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU,
FAIRY GODMOTHER.

SPLENDID. I ALWAYS
ENJOY A POLONAISE.
AHEM. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.
DOESN'T SPEAK
A WORD OF EUPHRANIAN.
JOHN?
John: MA'AM?
TAKE ME
ON THE FLOOR.
YES. YES, or COURSE.
HOW VERY
INTERESTING.
DO YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
EXCELLENT TEETH.
HA HA!
YOUR MAJESTIES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HER HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS... INCOGNITA.
WHO IS SHE?
WHO CAN SHE BE?
I'VE No IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
SHE'S NOT
ON MY LIST.
YOUR LIST,
YOUR LIST.
YOUR LIST. FIND
OUT, MAN. FIND OUT.
YES, SIR.
I DIDN'T QUITE
CATCH THE NAME.
NO, MOTHER.
NONE OF US DID.
MOST IRREGULAR.
PLAY ON.
PLAY ON.
I THINK...
I THINK I SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY
I'M HERE, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
MY EYES GIVE ME
ENOUGH REASONS.
MY NAME IS EDWARD,
AND IT IS FOR ME TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU,
EXPLAIN WHY
I SUBJECTED YOU
TO THIS
RIDICULOUS CHARADE.
I'M SURE I SEEM TO YOU
THE MASTER OF MY FATE,
BUT UNTIL
THIS MOMENT,
I'VE BEEN A PRISONER
TRAPPED BY MY BIRTHRIGHT.
TRAPPED?
YES.
IT WAS NEVER MY INCLINATION
TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS.
WHAT I MEAN IS...
AND I'M NOT SAYING
IT VERY WELL...
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT MARRIAGE...
SHOULD BEGIN WITH LOVE.
I'M SURE YOU AGREE.
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN
THE MATTER MUCH THOUGHT.
I'M AMAZED YOU EVEN ACCEPTED
THE INVITATION TO THE BALL.
YES.
I WAS A LITTLE
AMAZED MYSELF.
DIDN'T YOU
THINK IT ODD?
I SUPPOSE I DID.
BUT... YOU STILL CAME.
WHY?
MUST YOU
ASK THAT?
YES, I MUST.
I HAD HEARD
MUCH OF YOU.
GOOD OR BAD?
OH, NOTHING
BUT GOOD.
I CAN'T THINK HOW.
IF I WERE YOU, I'D HAVE
BELIEVED THE WORST.
YOU SEE,
I WAS EXPECTING--
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.
BUT WHATEVER
HAPPENS AFTERWARDS,
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER
THIS MOMENT.
AND YOU MUST TAKE MY PRESENT
HAPPINESS TO MAKE YOU HAPPIER.
TAKE IT...
WITH ALL MY HEART,
FOR I GIVE IT WITH
ALL MY HEART.
THERE'S A SECRET KINGDOM
ALL MY OWN
WITH No CASTLES AND No
VASSALS AND NO THRONE
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME
IN MY PRIVATE
MONARCHY
WHERE THE KING IS LOVE
AND LOVE ALONE
IN THAT SECRET
KINGDOM THAT YOU SEE
SHOULD THE MAKE-BELIEVE
BECOME REALITY
WITH No SCEPTER
IN YOUR HAND
No DOMINION
TO COMMAND
WOULD YOU BE CONTENT
WITH ONLY ME?
WHAT IS A SONG
THAT'S NEVER SUNG?
WHAT IS A HEART THAT'S NEVER
THRILLED TO BE YOUNG?
WHAT IS A DREAM THAT
CAN'T COME TRUE?
WHAT IS MY LIFE TO ME
WITHOUT M'! LOVE FOR YOU?
IF THAT SECRET KINGDOM'S
OURS TO SHARE
I COULD NEVER WISH FOR
MORE, FOR YOU'D BE THERE
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME
IN OUR PRIVATE
MONARCHY
ALL ALONE TOGETHER
WE WOULD LOVE FOREVER
IN OUR SECRET KINGDOM
FAR AWAY SOMEWHERE
AHEM.
YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS?
YES? WHAT IS IT?
HIS MAJESTY
REQUESTS AN AUDIENCE
WITH THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.
Edward: PLEASE
TELL MY FATHER
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO
GRANT HIS REQUEST.
YOU FRIGHTENED HER,
YOU FOOL!
WAIT !
COME BACK!
COME BACK.
RAINBOWS RACED
AROUND THE ROOM
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME
SHOOTING STARS
BEGAN TO ZOOM
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME
IN HIS ARMS
I WAS ASCENDING
MY WORLD BECAME
A MAGIC BLENDING
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME
THOUGH THIS LOVELY NIGHT WAS
ONLY A FANTASY
AND I KNOW TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE
DANCING
IN HIS ARMS FOREVER
MY HEART
WILL NEVER BE FREE
'DREAMING OF THE NIGHT

RAINBOWS RACED

AT LAST I SAW
THAT PERFECT BLENDING
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE

ONLY A FANTASY?
COULD IT BE TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE?

Stepmother:
CINDERELLA!
WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?
CINDERELLA!
YES, STEPMOTHER?
THERE YOU ARE.
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL?
I WANT A WEAK
INFUSION OF TEA.
MY HEAD IS FIT
FOR CRACKING.
GOOD MORNING,
MAMA.
MORNING, MAMA.
BRING
THE BREAKFAST.
IMMEDIATELY,
CINDERELLA.
I WASN'T ABLE
TO SLEEP.
OH, OH, THE EXCITEMENT
OF LAST NIGHT!
NOT ON THE BED,
MY PRECIOUS.
Palatine: YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN AMAZED.
YOUR STEPSISTERS
WERE A TRIUMPH.
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LATE ARRIVAL
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PRINCESS,
I FEEL SURE THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE MADE
HIS CHOICE BETWEEN MY TWO ANGELS.
WHAT PRINCESS WAS THAT?
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW.
HE SEEMED QUITE
TAKEN WITH HER,
BUT THEN, MEN ALWAYS
Go FOR THE OBVIOUS.
OH, YES.
I MEAN, SHE WAS NOT
THAT PRETTY...
STRIKING, PERHAPS.
Isobella: DON'T
FORGET M'! BREAKFAST.
Stepmother:
BREAKFAST.
THINK, MAMA--
WE WERE ACTUALLY
THERE AT THE CASTLE.
WHERE YOU BELONG,
MY DEAR.
I WONDER WHAT THE
PRINCE IS DOING TODAY?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PRINCE
IS GOING TO DO TODAY.
THE PRINCE IS GOING TO EXERCISE
HIS ROYAL PREROGATIVE FOR ONCE.
King: LEAVE US.
No, STAY. I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS.
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING
TREATED LIKE SOME VILLAGE IDIOT!
King: I'M GLAD YOU
STAYED TO HEAR THAT.
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE
HEIR TO THE THRONE.
FATHER, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TREATS ME LIKE AN IDIOT.
YOU ARRANGE A
BRIDE-FINDING BALL.
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT,
I FALL IN WITH YOUR PLANS.
I PLAY MY PART.
I GREET, I'M POLITE,
I DANCE WITH, I FLATTER,
I CONCEAL MY BOREDOM FROM HALF A DOZEN
TWITTERING MAIDENS OF BLUE BLOOD.
IN SHORT, I FULFILL MY SIDE
OF THE BARGAIN.
TRUE. I CAN 'T
FAULT HIM THERE.
AND THEN, BY SOME MIRACLE, I
FIND THE LADY OF MY CHOICE,
AND WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU FRIGHTEN HER AWAY!
A SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
IS BEING MADE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.
OUR POLICE--
OUR POLICE, FATHER, COULDN'T
FIND A MISSING HAYSTACK,
LET ALONE A NEEDLE.
HOW COULD SHE DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE?
DO WE NOT HAVE FRONTIERS,
CUSTOMS POSTS, GUARDS?
WE HAVE CUSTOMS,
OF COURSE.
VALUABLE SOURCE
OF REVENUE.
AND MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT OUR
POLICEMEN ARE WONDERFUL.
THIS IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY
CLUE WE HAVE, AND I FOUND IT.
IT'S REMARKABLY DAINTY.
EXACTLY.
IT'S UNIQUE...
LIKE ITS VANISHED OWNER.
THEREFORE, WE MUST USE IT.
WHOEVER FITS THE SLIPPER
MUST FIT THE BILL!
HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT!
WHOEVER FITS THIS SLIPPER
SHALL MARRY MY SON!
YOUR MAJESTY, YOU HAVE
SOLVED THE PROBLEM.
QUITE So.
NOW, WE MUST ACT--
UH, YOU MUST ACT.
UM, THIS SLIPPER
MUST BE TAKEN
TO EVERY STRANGER
OF NOTE IN THE LAND.
THIS REALLY IS--
IT REALLY IS
VERY DAINTY.
UM, THE YOUNG LADY
ARRIVED INCOGNITA
BUT MUST OBVIOUSLY BE
OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.
SHE CANNOT REMAIN
UNKNOWN FOREVER.
A PROCLAMATION
IS REQUIRED, SIRE.
YES. DRAFT IT
IMMEDIATELY.
BE IT KNOWN THAT IT IS
OUR ROYAL WILL
TO FIND THE OWNER OF
THIS CHARMING, UH"
HALF THE SIZE
OF YOUR MOTHER'S--
THIS GLASS SLIPPER,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.
YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT WITH YOU.
VERY DISTURBING.
HMM. I'M PROUD
OF YOU, EDWARD.
BY ROYAL COMMAND
OF HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
KNOW THIS--
THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL TRY ON
THIS SLIPPER
AND FIND IT A PERFECT FIT,
THEN, BY ROYAL DECREE,
SHE SHALL BE GIVEN
IN MARRIAGE
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE PRINCE EDWARD OF EUPHRANIA,
HEIR TO THE THRONE.
GOD SAVE THE KING!
PUSH! PUSH!
OH, I AM PUSHING, MAMA!
IT DOESN'T FIT.
LET ME TRY.
OOH...
NOW, PUSH HARD!
Edward:
HAVE YOU FOUND HER?
ANY SIGN OF HER AT ALL?
AND YOU?
AND YOU?
SIR?
HMM?
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.
I KNOW SHE EXISTS.
THE SLIPPER
WILL REMAIN THERE
AS A MONUMENT TO
MY LOST LOVE.
Edward:
HOW ABSURD LIFE IS.
DOWN THERE, EVERYTHING
IS So SIMPLE.
PEOPLE MEET,
FALL IN LOVE,
MARRY,
AND HAVE CHILDREN.
I DARESAY
THEY ENVY ME HERE.
I'M TOLD ENVY OF PRINCES
IS A COMMON ENOUGH THING.
Edward: 3 MONTHS,
6 DAYS, 10 HOURS.
THAT'S HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE LAST I SAW HER.
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS!
YES.
OH, HOW SELFISH OF ME.
FORGIVE ME, JOHN.
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR LADY CAROLINE?
OH, YES...
INFREQUENTLY.
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS.
YOU SEE, SIR, IF MY FATHER
WERE A CHANCELLOR...
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
THE LOVELY
LADY CAROLINE
WOULD BE A PROPER
WIFE, YOU SEE
BUT MY FATHER
WAS A SERVANT
AND MY MOTHER
SAME AS HE
So THE LADY
OF MY CHOOSING
IS A WORLD AWAY
FROM ME

YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,
BUT I SHALL
PROVE YOU WRONG,
FOR PRINCES,
WHEN CONVINCED,
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR POSITION.
I CAN'T THINK WHY I DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE.
John I ABOUT WHAT?
WAIT, AND ALL

KNEEL.
WHAT? ME?
I COMMAND IT.
I DUB THEE, AS IS MY

OF THE REALM,
YOU CAN NOW CLAIM THE HAND
OF THE FAIR LADY CAROLINE--
WHICH IS FORTUNATE
FOR YOU BUT WHICH, ALAS,
LEAVES ME WITHOUT
A COMPANION-AT-ARMS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
UH, WILLOUGHBY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
CAN HE NOT ANSWER
FOR HIMSELF?
IT'S NOT HIS
POSITIOH, YOU SEE.
AH, TRUE.
BUT IT WILL BE.
I SHALL ELEVATE YOU, TOO,
WILLOUGHBY.
FROM HENCEFORTH, YOU ARE MY
PERSONAL COMPANION-AT-ARMS,
WITH ALL THE PRIVILEGES
SUCH OFFICE BESTOWS.
YOU WILL NEED
A SWORD.
HERE.
TAKE MINE.
IT GOES THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.
HELP HIM, WILL YOU?
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD
MORNING'S WORK.
John: CONGRATULATIONS,
WILLOUGHBY.
AND CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, TOO, SIR JOHN.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
NOTHING.
GO AND FIND HER.
BE HAPPY.
HAPPY ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.
I MUST FETCH THE PRINCE.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOU WRETCHED GIRL? YOU...
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
OH!
OH!
I LITTLE KNEW, MADAM, THAT I WOULD
HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING
YOU AND YOUR DELIGHTFUL DAUGHTERS
AGAIN IN SUCH HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES.
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS?
YOU ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN, I
BELIEVE, OF MY WIFE TO BE.
YOUR WIFE TO BE?
WHY, YES. I AM MORE
THAN HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.
I HAVE BEEN A MOTHER TO HER.
THEN I DO RIGHT BY FORMALLY
ASKING YOUR PERMISSION
TO TAKE CINDERELLA'S
HAND IN MARRIAGE.
OH!
OH!
CONTROL YOURSELVES !
PERMISSION? WHY, OF COURSE!
GLADLY! NATURALLY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DO I--
WILL YOU BE QUIET?
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
PLEASE ALLOW ME THE HONOR OF
INVITING YOU INTO
OUR HAPPY HOME.
COME, CINDERELLA, DEAR.
WE WERE So WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
THANK YOU, BUT No, I HAVE OTHER
URGENT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.
IN MY HAPPINESS,
I FORGIVE YOU ALL.
FORGIVE ME?
HOW DARE SHE FORGIVE ME?
AND WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?
CINDERELLA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
A MOST UNUSUAL NAME.
Edward: THE NAME, MOTHER,
IS SURELY OF No IMPORTANCE.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT I'VE MADE MY
CHOICE AND WAIT FOR YOUR BLESSINGS.
YOU GAVE US A LOT OF TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE BALL.
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE. VANISHED, YOU SEE.
DID YOU Go BACK
TO YOUR OWN KINGDOM?
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. I WENT
BACK TO WHERE I LIVE.
AND WHERE IS THAT, CHILD?
WHY, HERE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
HERE? IN THE CASTLE?
No, FATHER. AS YOU'VE OFTEN
REMARKED, LOVE IS BLIND.
AND WE SOMETIMES DON'T LOOK
UNDER OUR NOSES.
CINDERELLA LIVES IN OUR OWN
EUPHRANIA, NOT 20 MILES FROM HERE.
WHO IS THIS GIRL?
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY TELL
ME WHAT IS GOING ON?
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT
EDWARD WANTS TO MARRY.
IS GOING TO
MARRY, FATHER.
I DON'T WISH TO
SEEM OFFENSIVE,
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME
THAT SHE'S MOST UNSUITABLY
DRESSED FOR SUCH A
SOLEMN OCCASION.
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, GRANDMAMA. IT'S
SOMETHING I SHALL CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.
FATHER, BY YOUR LEAVE.
King: QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT.
UNPRECEDENTED
QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENT.
MY OWN THOUGHT,
SIRE.
A MEETING, I THINK.
THE STAFF COUNCIL.
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN
CONVENED, YOUR MAJESTY.
PITY. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.
IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES...
MOST APPEALING.
WHO IS IT?
MILADY, I'M COMMANDED
BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING
TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE.
OH.
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
PLEASE ENTER.
MI LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
MILADY.
FORGIVE ME FOR
DISTURBING YOUR REST...
BUT, ALAS, THERE ARE
SOME MATTERS OF STATE
THAT CANNOT BE DELAYED.
HIS MAJESTY HAS REQUESTED ME,
AS HIS PRINCIPAL MINISTER...
TO BROACH...
A QUESTION OF
SOME DELICACY.
I...
YOU LOVE THE PRINCE EDWARD,
DO YOU NOT?
WHY, OF COURSE.
WHO WOULDN'T?
OH, QUITE SO.
UH, PLEASE. PLEASE.
AND HE HAS EXPRESSED
HIS LOVE FOR YOU
BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT.
YES.
YES, HE HAS.
VERY COMMENDABLY.
BIS MAKES...
OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR.
I'M REALLY TOO OLD
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.
FORGIVE ME,
MY DEAR CHILD, BUT...
DESPITE MY APPEARANCE
AND THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
OF MY HIGH OFFICE...
I AM NOT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUR PLIGHT.
FOR PLIGHT IT IS.
TO BE BLUNT,
BECAUSE THE HOUR IS LATE.
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIS
MAJESTY TO GIVE CONSENT
TO SUCH A MARRIAGE.
NOT POSSIBLE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HMM. WELL...
YOUR LOVE
FOR THE PRINCE
AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU,
WELL, THAT IS A FINE
AND PRIVATE THING.
WOULD THAT IT COULD
REMAIN so,
BUT THE TIMES DEMAND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
THE PRINCE MUST MAKE
A MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE
WITH A PRINCESS
OF THE BLOOD ROYAL.
AND THAT IS WHY
I AM HERE,
BURDENED WITH
THIS UNHAPPY TASK.
YOU SEE,
MY DEAR CHILD,
IN LIFE, LOVE CANNOT
ALWAYS FIND A WAY.
YOU WERE BORN HERE,
SO YOU KNOW THAT
OUR LITTLE KINGDOM,
WHILST FAR FROM PERFECT,
HAS YET ENJOYED COUNTLESS
CENTURIES OF PEACE.
NOW THAT PEACE IS
THREATENED FROM WITHOUT.
THERE ARE SOME WHO LOOK
TOWARDS OUR FRONTIERS
WITH GREEDY EYES.
YOU SEE ONLY LOVE
AND HAPPINESS
STARING YOU IN THE FACE.
I SEE NOTHING BUT WAR
AND DESTRUCTION...
UNLESS A SACRIFICE
IS MADE.
AND THE SACRIFICE...
IS TO BE ME.
YES.
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,
BUT I HAVE TO
ASK IT.
TO LEAVE HIM NOW?
TO LEAVE HIM NOW,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
BUT HE WOULD
SEARCH FOR ME AGAIN.
HE WOULD SEARCH
FOR ME AND FIND ME.
I KNOW HE WOULD.
YES. THAT, TOO,
IS TRUE,
BUT WE'VE ALLOWED
FOR THAT.
IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT WITH PROPER DOWRY
AND EVERY OTHER
CONSIDERATION
FITTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THIS MOST UNHAPPY OCCASION,
IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU BE
TAKEN FROM HERE THIS VERY NIGHT
TO A SECRET PLACE OF EXILE
FAR BEYOND OUR BORDERS.
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
NOTHING, THEN.
I THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING SUCH TIDINGS
WITH TACT
AND UNDERSTANDING.
YOU WERE WELL CHOSEN
FOR THE TASK.
YOUR LADIES-IN-WAITING
WILL BE SENT FOR.
BUT IN BOWING TO
THE ROYAL DEMANDS,
I MUST MAKE ONE
OF MY OWN.
MILADY?
IT IS NOT VERY MUCH
AND SOMETHING
WHICH...
WITH YOUR GREATER EXPERIENCE
IN THESE MATTERS,
YOU WILL NOT FIND
VERY DIFFICULT.
I WISH YOU TO TELL HIS
ROYAL HIGHNESS...
PRINCE EDWARD...
I WISH
YOU'D TELL HIM...
TELL HIM...
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE
SAY I TRIED
SAY I LIED
TELL HIM
I'M UNWORTHY OF
WHAT HE FEELS
INSIDE
TELL HIM THAT
YOU HEARD ME SAY
WHAT SEEMED RIGHT
JUST LAST NIGHT
SIMPLY SEEMED
TO FADE AWAY
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY
TELL HIM OF THE
COUNTLESS OTHER LOVERS
WHOM I TANTALIZED,
VICTIMIZED
TELL HIM OF
THE MANY OTHER TIMES
I'VE PLAYED
THIS HEARTLESS GAME
JUST TEE SAW'.
'TELL HIM
WHAT I REALLY AM
IS JUST A COLD
AND EMPTY SHAM
TELL HIM ANYTHING
BUT NOT
THAT I LOVE HIM
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE
ALL WE SHARED,
ALL WE CARED
MAKE HIM HATE
MY MEMORY
MAKE HIM GLAD HE'S FREE
PAINT ME EVIL,
PAINT ME CRUEL
SAY I BROKE EVERY RULE
MAKE HIM FEEL
THAT HE'S A FOOL
FOR HIS LOVING ME
DON'T LET HIM KNOW
WHY I MUST LEAVE HIM
WHY I MUS GO
SO FAR AWAY
FOR IF HE KNEW
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM
NO POWER ON EARTH
COULD MAKE HIM STAY
YOUR MAJESTY.
THE DEED IS DONE.
SHE CERTAINLY BEHAVED
LIKE A PRINCESS.
Edward: COME ON!
THE FRONTIER!
FATHER.
FATHER, YOU HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
THE SPOILS
ARE YOURS,
BUT IT IS
A SMALL VICTORY.
IF I COULD EXPLAIN...
SPARE ME THAT.
SPARE ME THE FINAL HYPOCRISY
OF YOUR SYMPATHY.
TAKE YOUR MAP.
REARRANGE IT TO YOUR
HEARTS CONTENT.
MAKE YOUR PRECIOUS
MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE.
YOU'VE DESTROYED WHATEVER
VESTIGE OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS
I MIGHT HAVE FOUND,
AND YOU'VE DONE IT IN
THE NAME OF PATRIOTISM.
SO... LET IT BE THUS.
CHOOSE ME A BRIDE
FROM AMONGST THE RAGBAG
OF ROYAL VIRGINS
I HAVE TWICE
REJECTED.
CHOOSE WHO YOU WILL.
I CARE NOT.
I'LL PLAY MY PUBLIC
PART TO THE ALTAR
BUT NO FURTHER.
YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
WILL LIVE WITH YOU
BUT DIE WITH ME.
DEAR CINDERELLA,
FORGIVE ME.
I HAVE NO HEART FOR WHAT
I MUST SHORTLY PERFORM.
MY HEART IS YOURS
AND YOURS ALONE.
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GRIEVE
FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE.
IT'S ONLY IN FAIRY TALES
THAT THE PRINCE...
MARRIES THE LADY
OF HIS CHOICE.
THE REAL WORLD
IS NOT SO KIND.
THERE ARE NO
PRIVATE KINGDOMS"
ONLY PUBLIC ONES.
I HAVE LOVED BUT ONCE.
I HAVE LOVED BUT YOU,
AND I HAVE LOST YOU TWICE.
I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH
THE LOVE WE SHARED
THE DREAM WE DARED
WAS JUST A PRAYER
THAT CAN'T COME TRUE
I TRY TO STOP
REMEMBERING
BUT TILL THE DAY I DIE
WITHIN MY MEMORY
WILL LIVE THE MELODY
OF THE SONG
THAT WAS YOU AND ME
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH
I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU
FOR I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY
AND WHAT, MIGHT I ASK,
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, IT'S YOU.
YOU GAVE ME
SUCH A SHOCK.
I SHOULD HOPE So.
THAT IS NOTHING TO THE SHOCK
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME.
WHY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT
HOW I PLANNED IT.
OH, REALLY!
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD RETIRE.
UNLESS I'M
ON THE SPOT
TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL,
SOMETHING
ALWAYS GOES WRONG.
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU STAYED BEYOND
THE STROKE OF
MIDNIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?
YES. OH, BUT PLEASE
DON'T SCOLD ME.
I'M UNHAPPY ENOUGH
AS IT IS.
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE UNHAPPY.
ANY GIRL
WOULD BE UNHAPPY
IF SHE WERE MISSING
HER OWN WEDDING.
WEDDING?
YES.
THE PRINCE GETS
MARRIED TODAY.
I HAD THE DATE
UNDERLINED IN MY DIARY.
WHY ELSE DO YOU SUPPOSE
I AM DRESSED LIKE THIS?
WHO...
WHO'S HE MARRYING?
WELL, AT THE MOMENT, THE
WRONG GIRL, OBVIOUSLY.
OH, IT'S
TOO IRRITATING.
I HAD IT
ALL MAPPED OUT.
WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHALL SIMPLY
HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION
AND DO SOMETHING
SPECTACULAR YET AGAIN,
AND SPECTACULARS ALWAYS
TAKE So MUCH OUT OF ME.
JUST COME DOWN
OFF THE SWING.
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH SNOW WHITE.
ALL THE SAME,
YOU YOUNG GIRLS.
NEVER DO
AS YOU'RE TOLD.
MEN ARE MUCH EASIER.
OH, MAMA.
YOUR MAJESTY.
SIRE.
AHEM.
SIR.
AHEM !
OH...
King: WHAT CAN I SAY?
THIS Is, UH--
I CAN ASSURE YOU--
Father of bride: YOUR EXCUSE
IS ABSOLUTELY INADEQUATE.
AHH.
IS THE CEREMONY
OVER?
WHAT A RELIEF!
YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS COULD LEAD TO WAR.
I KNOW, I KNOW!
WELL, THINK OF SOMETHING!
HE CANNOT
MARRY HER, SIRE.
THE CONSTITUTION
DOES NOT ALLOW IT.
WELL, DON'T TELL ME.
I WROTE IT.
YES. DON'T TELL HIM.
HE WROTE IT.
I BEG YOUR
PARDOH, MADAM?
AND IF HE WROTE IT,
HE CAN UNWRITE IT.
DON'T YOU AGREE,
YOUR MAJESTY?
HE CAN WRITE
WHAT HE LIKES,
So LONG AS
HE CLEARS THIS ROOM.
THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN IT BY FAR,
MOST OF THEM
NOT WORTH A CANDLE.
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE KING.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I AM!
AND ABSOLUTE MONARCHS
SHOULD ACT ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S VERY BECOMING.
SHE'S RIGHT
WHO IS SHE?
I'VE NO IDEA, SIRE.
SHE MUST BE
ONE OF THE VISITORS.
BUT EVEN IF YOU ALTER THE
CONSTITUTIOH, YOUR MAJESTY,
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF THE OTHER BRIDE.
No, YOU'RE RIGHT. SO WE'RE
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.
IT'S STARING YOU
IN THE FACE.
WHAT IS?
THE ANSWER.
King: WHAT SORT OF
AN ANSWER IS THAT?
Fairy Godmother:
THEY'RE IN LOVE!
THEY ARE?
IT WAS LOVE AT
FIRST SIGHT.
YOU HAVE MY WORD
FOR IT.
ASK HIM.
COUSIN...
COUSIN, IT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO MY NOTICE--
OH, YES. AND TO MINE.
ISN'T SHE RAVISHING?
BUT, UH, AM I
TO UNDERSTAND--
YES... ANYTHING.
Woman: IT REALLY
IS DISGRACEFUL.
WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO AS FATHERS
FACED WITH THIS VERY HUMAN DILEMMA?
IT'S A QUESTION
OF HONOR.
YES. WELL, IT WOULD SEEM IN ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE, UH...
AFAIT ACCOMPLI?
IT'S CERTAINLY
A FATE. HA HA.
THE YOUNGER GENERATION'S
SO FICKLE.
NOT LIKE US,
NO SENSE OF DUTY,
NO SENSE OF HISTORY.
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
I HAD A SWORD IN MY BACK.
YOU, TOO?
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
WE NEVER SHIRKED
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.
SO, WHAT'S IT TO BE?
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER WEDDING.
YES. IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT.
CAN I SPEAK
AS MAN TO MAN?
I'D WELCOME IT.
HE'S, UH, NOT WHAT
I WANTED, BUT, us...
THEN NEITHER
WAS SHE.
OH, CHARMING GIRL!
PLENTY OF SPIRIT.
I'LL ARRANGE EVERYTHING.
MY PLACE, I THINK.
THE SOONER THE BETTER.
YES, THUS CEMENTING
OUR GREAT ALLIANCE.
CONCEAL ING
OUR SHAME.
AMEN.
IN THE NAME
OF THE FATHER,
OF THE SOH, AND
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
AMEN.
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
AND OF THE SON
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
AMEN.
AMEN.

TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA
Sir, we will arrive at the ocean boundary shortly.
Prepare to submerge the submarine before we reach the ocean boundary.
Roger. Begin submersion, depth 250!
Beginning submersion, depth 250.
The scattered remains of Mechagodzilla should be found within this area.
It would be in our best interest to collect the head. Be as careful as possible.
I understand.
Depth, 250!
Switch to deep sea scanning!
Searchlight!
Begin procedures!
That's strange... Our analysis equipment is having no reaction.
There are no traces of space-titanium within a 500 meter radius.
Even if there wasn't any wreckage, we should have received some kind of reaction by now.
It's not within the radius of this area?
We show absolutely nothing.
Mechagodzilla's remains must be...
What is it?
- Blow the main tanks!
It's no use!
Base! Base! We're in trouble!
Certainly, the ocean exploration research ship was in its experimental stages.
But I cannot believe the accident was caused by a design flaw or some kind of technical error.
What has become of the wreckage?
Well, it appears that a powerful form of energy ripped the submarine to pieces.
Ripped it apart?
It wasn't an explosion?
I'm sure of it.
He's right, Boss.
Take a look at this.
A flying saucer?
That's what we've concluded.
The cinema crew that took this photo swore it was taken on the day it sank.
We cannot say what it is yet, but we need to be very cautious now.
I'm Ichinose from the Ocean
Exploration Research Institute.
Hey, Ichinose!
- Hey, old buddy!
You two know each other?
Yes, we went college together.
Really? Well, well... have a seat.
- Right.
We were waiting for you.
Thanks...
Now that we are all here...
...I want you to listen to the data from this voice recorder.
Answer us! Answer us, please!
Base! Base! Answer us!
Ah! A fish! It's coming for us!
No, it's not a fish!
It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur?
Replay that again.
No, it's not a fish!
It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur!
He definitely said "dinosaur"...
You're from the marine institute, what do you think?
I don't believe it...
Commander, sorry to keep you waiting.
How was your trip?
Earth vehicles are so horrible.
Thousands of hours of space flight could not compare to one hour in their inferior vehicles.
Incredible...
But they will soon tremble before our might.
So, this is Tokyo...
This city is the very essence of what is wrong with the Earth.
Ignoring the pollution and destruction they've created and not knowing what to do about it...
I do not understand them...
This is what will become of Tokyo...
Our city will be built once we've destroyed the old one...
And the preparations?
- They're going forward as planned.
The base on our third planet is being pulled in by the black hole.
We must relocate to the Earth.
We cannot allow failure...
Commander, it might be useful to hire some earthlings.
Earthlings?!
A science instructor, Dr. Shinzo Mafune.
He is an extraordinary earthling that may benefit our cause.
Can you trust him?
As long as we keep his daughter alive.
Besides, Dr. Mafune hates his fellow earthlings!
And why is that?
Twenty years ago, Dr. Mafune was the top scientist in his field.
His research was more advanced than the others and he was punished for it...
Dr. Mafune studied at this institute.
He was a brilliant biologist...
Thirty years ago, he published a plan about the idea of undersea exploration...
This plan caught the world's attention...
He also tested ways in which he could control animals...
But many of these tests were unsuccessful...
One day, he issued a report on the discovery a dinosaur living at the bottom of Ogasawara Bay...
The doctor named the dinosaur, Titanosaurus...
He was sure he would be able to control it...
In the end, it changed the Doctor's life...
And about 15 years ago...
...he ended his studies at the institute.
It was said that he left because he pushed himself too hard...
Mr. Oota, what did you think of Dr. Mafune's studies?
To control animals scientifically...
As a human being, I don't think we have the right to wield such power.
I will always be opposed to it...
Sir, where does Dr. Mafune live?
He used to live in Manazuru. I don't know where he is now.
Really? Thank you very much.
Mafune, huh? Oh, the lunatic that lives in the mansion!
You're right. His mansion is in the middle of that forest.
I haven't seen anyone there in a while...
And no one wants to go near that place!
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Is this Dr. Mafune's residence?
- Hey, wait!
Hello. Is this Dr. Mafune's residence?
I'd really like to see the Doctor. I'm...
He is dead.
He died?
Five years ago.
Excuse me... Excuse me, Miss!
I'm with the International
Police Organization.
He's from the Ocean
Exploration Research Institute.
I am Ichinose.
The truth is, we are interested in the Doctor's research on a dinosaur.
Do you know anything about it?
A Dinosaur?
We believe it was the cause of some attacks recently.
I'm sorry, but his office isn't here.
When father was alive, he did not speak about his work.
You don't have anything we can look at?
Did your father leave anything here from work?
I burned it all... when my father died.
Burned it?
Out of all of his notes, can you remember anything you could tell us?
Please forgive me...
I do not want to think about that incident.
That was strange... What was she so bothered about?
Congratulations, Doctor.
This deserves a toast!
A toast!
Now that Titanosaurus' control is complete...
...you've helped us make this a very happy occasion.
No, no... I could not have completed my research without your assistance.
Father, Interpol was just here.
What?
- Interpol?
They were interested in hearing about your research on dinosaurs.
Well, their interest is fifteen years too late...
Now I will make them all think!
I'll show them my theory was correct!
I'll wipe out the fools of the world who thought I was mad! I'll show them all...!
Father...
Katsura, don’t you worry about me...
Doctor, it's time to show you what you were working for.
Me?
It's for your revenge...
The perfect weapon for you to use.
What in the world is that?
Mechagodzilla...
Mechagodzilla?
Then you're...
Yes...
We are spacemen from the
Third Planet of the Black Hole.
After Godzilla had defeated
Mechagodzilla the first time...
...we pulled it from the ocean and began rebuilding it.
Doctor...
Let me introduce you to our commander, Mugal.
I've waited for this moment, Dr. Mafune...
What do you think of our science facilities?
This is a tremendous opportunity!
I am pleased that you think so.
Doctor, I have a favor to ask of you...
We would like you to give us the control device that you have invented.
With your Titanosaurus and our Mechagodzilla...
...we would achieve our goals with little opposition.
A prisoner has escaped!
What?! Alright let's go!
It's alright. We will capture him before he reaches any other humans.
Did you really think you could escape? Fire!
Attaching weapons to the sub will slow it down.
Our current sonar's range is about 500 meters.
We can try to expand it to 1 to 1.5 kilometers.
That way, we'll have an advanced warning before the dinosaur gets too close.
Originally, Titanosaurus was not considered an aggressive species.
It would not attack anything on its own.
We found this book while searching the area with Ichinose.
This is Dr. Mafune's notebook.
How about it, Wakayama...
Will one kilometer be enough?
Let me look into it.
Not particularly aggressive?
Oh, thank you.
Sorry for calling you here so urgently.
Well, thank you.
You didn't have to come.
The truth is, we've stumbled on some notes that were written by the Doctor.
Here they are.
I've noticed that the Doctor's and my own views were about the same.
Ichinose...
Please forget everything about the Titanosaurus.
Both the Doctor's and my findings are quite similar.
Who else could come to these conclusions?
But...
Katsura, we are investigating this matter.
Investigating?
Yes, we are preparing a second submarine.
You're going to investigate the dinosaur?
Yes. I was wondering if you would come along as well.
That way we could prove the Doctor's theory together.
Would you like to come along?
Stop, please! I beg of you!
I thought you would be pleased with what I was doing...
Katsura! Come with me!
Katsura, have you forgotten?
I understand what I did.
You shouldn't be saying anything to the humans you've met out there.
Father, Ichinose's and your studies are very similar.
Katsura, will you forget about it?
Your mother did not want you involved in my research.
For your own good, do not follow a single word of it! Our poor and scorned lives...
The pain drove her to her death!
Katsura, we cannot turn back from our course.
That man and his friends are going to investigate it.
This is Yamashita from Shizuoka.
Thank you.
This gentleman wanted to hand over this fragment he found at Mount Amagi.
This is space-titanium.
Analyze it to ensure there is no doubt.
Yes, sir...
But how did he get it?
I was working on the Yamagoya underground water pipe when it happened.
The man pointed at a large scar on his throat and motioned that he could not speak.
He wrote the word "Interpol" on his hand and pushed me back into the access tank.
Moments later, several men chased after him and tried to kill him.
The body looked as if it was mowed down.
Did he die at Amagi?
Begin an immediate investigation!
Yes, sir!
Could he have survived the attack?
We'll know shortly, but he gave
Yamashita the vital clue we needed!
Here.
It's nearly complete, Doctor.
With Mechagodzilla fitted with your control device...
...the greatest robot-monster will be born.
No, it needs one more thing to become a great machine.
It needs living brain cells in order for that to happen.
I see...
Just a moment Doctor... Was an investigation launched to find Titanosaurus?
Katsura knows Titanosaurus better than I ever will.
Then it will be okay?
Commander, do you...?
No, no. Don't mind me.
I'm sure Katsura wouldn't do anything wrong.
The investigation team is leaving today at 1 PM.
Yes, are you going? Why?
Is that so? I understand.
Please wait for me until we return from searching for the dinosaur.
Ah! Hello? Dr. Mafune's...
The investigation team is leaving?
Why won't you come with our investigation team? Why?
He can't go! He's in danger!
Katsura, you must keep your head clear for a little longer.
Decide... You cannot let this get under your skin.
Remember who saved you when you were dying.
I'm finished! Katsura, it's complete! I've completed it!
This is a great achievement!
Please have the honor of activating it.
Alright!
Well, let's throw the switch! Ready?
Yes!
Katsura!
Katsura! Katsura!
Katsura!
What the...? Who are you?!
Your heart is made of wires and gears.
Who would ever love someone like that?
Forget about your human friend.
You should think about this...
You are your father's remaining fountain of strength.
Would you remove such strength?
Revenge and hate...
Yes... Call out Titanosaurus. It must attack the investigation team.
Forget about your search for Titanosaurus!
Internal temperature, 18...
Hey, how's our status?
Ok...
What's wrong? What happened?
The gauge is going wild!
It's like a powerful magnetic force!
Ah, there!
Yes, that's it!
Attack!
It seems to be hurt!
Right! Lets get out of here!
Titanosaurus! Titanosaurus!
Damn earthlings!
The dinosaur slowed down suddenly?
Yes. The dinosaur's attack ended as soon as we contacted the base.
We'd switched on all of our transmitters.
The switch produced many supersonic waves.
Then you think this might be a clue?
Yes.
The sound waves may have had an affect on it.
Boss, we could create a machine that transmits a powerful sound wave.
Alright. Let's propose the countermeasure to headquarters.
You're in an awkward position.
You must be eliminated!
Buddy!
How dare you let the earthlings escape from here!
Execute these pathetic bastards!
Move it!
Father...
What's wrong, Katsura?
It's Titanosaurus...
Titanosaurus? What's wrong with it?
It chased after the submarine when something seemed to hurt it.
What?
What could hurt Titanosaurus?
Next, the sound device. We had a problem with the directional emitter.
We wanted something that could be aimed like a flashlight.
From the parabolic lens, we can concentrate the sound waves into one particular beam.
We can redirect, reinforce and increase its power dramatically.
We encountered a mysterious group that attacked us at Mount Anagi.
They shot at us with weapons that I've never seen before.
Were they spacemen?
I can't be sure of it.
Anyway, should we go on full alert?
Not until we find out their true colors first.
Notify the Self Defense
Force about them.
What do you want with me?
These are my father's research notes.
I found them at my father's house in Kanazawa.
Kanazawa? Did he live in Kanazawa?
I thought they would be a great help to you with your research at the office.
Thank you.
This new data will benefit my research.
Won't you stay for some tea?
Yes.
So, the dinosaur really exists?
Yes it does, just like your father said.
I... I think the dinosaur might be a vicious creature.
I had hoped my father was wrong about his ideas.
It's alright! The dinosaur has a weakness.
It can't stand supersonic waves.
Supersonic?
We're developing a supersonic gun that we'll be able to use soon.
Then we will return to our investigation.
A Supersonic gun?
I'd like to see that...
I'll show them Titanosaurus' true power!
Father...
Are you going to sell out mankind to the spacemen?
Don't you know anything? It will become one of the greatest destroyers of life!
Just like King Ghidorah,
Rodan and Manda!
Do you want Titanosaurus to be a monster just like them?
Katsura...
I'm not only sending Titanosaurus out just for Mugal's purpose...
I'm not bowing down to the spacemen!
Mechagodzilla is not the enemy of Titanosaurus.
I want to prove to them all that I was right!
I want to show those useless fools at the academic society!
I want them to see the proof that I was right!
Go... Titanosaurus!
That's it. Let's install it.
Right!
Units One and Two are ready to attack!
- Right!
This is horrible!
- It's pretty bad!
The wiring! The wiring is cut!
Damn!
Who could have done this?
Well, get this fixed as quickly as possible!
Yes, sir!
Wakayama!
Titanosaurus has just come ashore!
Murakoshi, it happened!
Someone sabotaged the supersonic gun!
What? The supersonic gun?
Damn! Wakayama...
Without that, we have no way to stop it!
You look over there!
- Yes, sir!
The Doctor has unleashed Titanosaurus without waiting for his instructions!
I know...
Should we send a team to stop him?
This could affect our plans!
No, wait...
Look at this...
A super giger-counter!
Who is Mechagodzilla's greatest enemy?
Godzilla.
Correct... Look!
Godzilla is heading straight for Titanosaurus now.
He will fight Titanosaurus and defeat him...
...but Godzilla won't have time to regain his strength.
This time, in a single stroke, we will attack Tokyo.
This is Mechagodzilla's revenge!
Prefect Ural wards 3 and 4, please report to your ground shelters immediately!
Father!
Katsura! Katsura!
Katsura went to find those notes just for me!
Maybe, but she was the only one besides us who knew about the supersonic gun.
If you knew that, then why don't you suspect me of the same thing?!
Katsura wasn't that type of person!
Ichinose!
Forget about it, she's dead now.
I still believe in her. What else is there to say to you?
Ichinose!
Yamamoto!
Yamamoto, you've done what you could.
Leave him alone for now...
Why didn't you wait for my instructions?
It's alright...
Now you know that we both have a common enemy.
Doctor... From now on you will follow our orders in our battle.
Alright?
This is the second time you saved my daughter's life...
I will do whatever you ask.
Will you be able to repair the equipment?
Yes, I can. But it will take two days.
Two days?
This is the first lookout point and here is the second lookout point.
Please keep someone posted at the lookouts while we evacuate the civilians.
But we still won't have any weapon capable of defeating Titanosaurus...
Please do what you can, quickly.
Wakayama, I beg of you.
Finish this in one day.
But, Boss...
No! One day! I can have anything you need here within an hour.
Boss... Can I go to Amagi?
What for?
This time, it's their base!
Alright. I understand.
Doctor... Mechagodzilla's control center is linked to Katsura.
When the earthmen finally find this base...
I'll destroy it and remove the problem.
I have arranged for it to explode as soon as Mechagodzilla leaves the base.
From then on, Katsura will be
Mechagodzilla's control center.
Not even Interpol will be able to find it.
Doctor... You told me that in your opinion...
...Mechagodzilla would be ineffective without living brain cells.
Now, Katsura's brain cells and
Mechagodzilla's mechanics are linked...
...creating a powerful cyborg.
Katsura's hate will turn Mechagodzilla's hate into a powerful explosive force.
Doctor...
When this fight is over, you will be able to live your life with your daughter.
We will build you the first building in a new Tokyo, over the ashes of the old city.
Katsura!
Forgive me, Katsura.
Forgive me...
Katsura...
I'll complete the Doctor's research for you. I will...
Katsura?!
Katsura, is that you?
And you are... the one looking for Titanosaurus?
Who are you?
Mafune...
Dr. Mafune?!
You bastards! Let me go!
If you sit still, you can witness the inevitable destruction of your city.
Bastards, What are you doing?!
We are saviors...
We will remove the weak humans from this fouled earth and replace them with saviors.
Doctor!
How could you?!
I believed in your work!
Think of your pride!
It's too late for anything.
It's out of my hands!
Doctor!
Prepare to attack.
Well, Katsura...
Call Mechagodzilla...
Katsura!
We're too late! Damn! Wait!
Help us! Help us!
It's no use! Get back!
Hey, old man!
What's going on?!
An explosion? Alright, get out of here, hurry!
Let's go!
Katsura, call Titanosaurus!
At this moment, the spacemen-controlled
Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla...
... are invading the heart of the city!
Go Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus!
Destroy the earthlings!
Those are rotation missiles.
Mechagodzilla has new weapons.
Incredible! Where is Godzilla?
Stop! Stop, Gen!
It's dangerous!
No, it's alright!
I'll go on by myself!
Okay, I'm going too.
Help us!
- Godzilla help us!
Isn't it done yet?!
I'm connecting the circuits!
We're leaving.
- Good luck!
There's nothing wrong.
Good.
Yes, that's it!
Dr. Mafune completed his invention.
That's why Titanosaurus isn't gentle...
Base! Base! This is Murakoshi!
I'm heading for Munazuru.
Send troops to Dr. Mafune's home!
That's it Titanosaurus! Stomp your foe Godzilla beneath your feet!
Katsura...
Katsura, you're not yourself.
Be silent...
Look there!
Ready to fire!
Fire!
Fight!
Fight, Titanosaurus!
What's wrong?!
Doctor!
Mechagodzilla, a little more!
Commander!
What's wrong?
The Defense Force is approaching this area!
What?
Mechagodzilla!
Damn!
Titanosaurus...
Fight, Titanosaurus!
Katsura!
You are mistaken.
Katsura, you can't!
You are mistaken!
You're not who I think you are?
No...
I'm not the human you think I am.
Katsura!
Don't move!
Ichinose, are you okay?!
Katsura...
Katsura...
Katsura!
Doctor!
Katsura!
Father!
Father!
Don't move!
It's alright. It's alright.
Even though you are a cyborg, I still love you.
It's not your fault...
It's not your fault!
You... You are a human.
You'd never lose the heart of a human being!
I beg you... Please kill me!
The mechanism that controls
Mechagodzilla is inside of me!
But... if I were... to be killed...
Idiot! I won't do it!
I won't do it... I won't do it!
Katsura!
Katsura...
Well fire!
Do you think your bullets have a chance of killing the great Mugal?
Fire!
We did it!
We did it!
We've done it!
THE FANTASTIC PLANET
She stopped moving.
Now we can't play with her any more.
Careful! It's Mr. Sihn.
Look, father.
A female Om and her baby.
Is she dead?
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.
Why does the baby make noise?
It's either frightened or hungry.
We can't leave him.
May I keep him?
Let me, father.
I'll take care of him.
All right, Tiwa, we can't let the animal die.
He was the Great Master of the Traag people.
He saved my life and took me into his home.
Mother!
Mother!
See how cute the little Om is!
His mother's dead.
I want to keep him.
He is very pretty, Tiwa.
You disturbed your mother's Meditation!
Make that animal behave or I'll take it away!
Father, he got away.
He needs a collar.
Learn to use the Watch.
Now put the animal down.
It's fun. Let me try.
No so fast.
The animal is delicate.
You might hurt it.
Did you name it?
Tiwa, like me.
That's not an Om's name.
Name it Frisky or Trusty.
Watch him wiggle, the little devil!
I'll name him Terr.
I was forgotten!
A baby Om is nothing compared to Meditation!
A weird virtual.
Traags devoted most of their time to it.
It seemed to be chief concern.
Oddly enough, the housing unit factory on our Uva at Goham... has not met production levels.
The machines show unusual wear...
This wear causes the delay.
Master Taj, can you explain?
We don't know yet.
Meanwhile we’ll use machines from our reserve... to meet the schedule.
I don't understand.
The machines worked perfectly until now.
Have you had similar problems on other Uvas?
Only machines from our space flight... to planet Antax 4 have trouble completing their program.
Master Sihn, our scientists... explain this loss as a break in the sensory compensation system.
Scientists also notice that animals brought from planet Terra... have sovibon and rather high intelligence.
I am not sure that is true.
Obviously, the animal adapts rather well.
But is that intelligence?
The little pet you stroke... between Meditations may well... surprise you some day.
Films made in Terra show many traces of organized life.
This ability to adapt, Master Kon may indicate advanced evolution.
Oms have a much shorter life span that we.
But we must not forget that they multiply much more rapidly.
If the animal is intelligent,
Master Sihn... we have not yet noticed.
What we do notice is the considerable damage... caused by Oms on the Uvas of Jext and Telez.
The numbers of tame Oms is easy to control.
But wild Oms probably exist... in much larger numbers than most of us realize.
We de-om the enclaves... of wild Oms every 3 cycles.
But I wonder if... that is often enough.
Few weapons have a long-term effect.
Drastic measures must be taken.
New ways to fight them are being researched.
I doubt if they will suffice.
Go play somewhere else.
I'm very sorry.
Imagination was so rich today too...
That Om is a pest!
Please, our children all love those animals.
I grew up fast in that slow world.
A Traag week was equal to one of my years.
I was only a live plaything.
I was sometimes rebellious.
Tiwa loved me.
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Tiwa got her learning from a headphone.
Its lessons cut directly into the brain... engraved on the memory forever.
"Our Planet Ygam has one satellite...
"the Fantastic Planet.
It is uninhabited
"and used for Meditation.
"Ygam is divided into several Uvas.
"Uvas Strop and Yot are natural and symmetrical.
"Urtana, the largest Uva, is covered
"with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range...
"is from 8 to 243 laics...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible...
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea...
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laics.
"Fixations bloc offset pontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure.
"All Uvas under go a cycle of 3 seasons of unequal length.
"The seasons of garus crystalization..."
An accident enabled me to acquire the Traags knowledge.
"When the soil peels, intense vegetation..."
"replaces all nosks with similar nosks."
I liked the lessons.
I tried to get the most out of them.
"The cliffs on the fepular sea are eroded...
"by rains that often last long."
Tiwa, bring your animal!
Jurgal has his and we'll have some fun.
I don't want him hurt.
Jurgal's animal is insane!
Once, he almost tore off his ears!
He won't damage your Om.
Come and play!
Come and see!
Let Terr fight, it will be more fun.
Terr will win, he's a real demon!
Now fight!
He sings well.
Terr can sing too.
Sing, Terr. Go on!
- He'll strangle him!
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
What a mean animal!
"It is simple to see a tark's fladed muscles...
"because the animal's easily skinned..."
Do you hear the Om?
That's Tiwa's lesson!
She loves Terr so much that he is with her always.
Can he understand what he says?
I don't think so.
Anyway, I'll forbid her to keep Terr during infos.
She must study seriously.
"The liscinian muscle of a trak's leg...
"is a fleshy, fuliform vilok...
"The molog is an enviparous animal...
"It has more than half a billion lucons.
"The entire surface of their walls...
"is made up of little cells...
"separated by leaves of thin organure."
"Some scientists...
"today believe it is not organure but only gambous amalga...
" an artificial structure... "
Have you got Terr again during you info?
I told you to stop!
Into the Omhouse!
But father, he doesn't bother me...
And he's so happy.
The infos are for you!
Get back to work!
It was time for the Traag children to have their first Meditation...
The initiation ceremony was a major step... on their road to knowledge.
After a while
I lost my intimacy with Tiwa.
As she grew up, she gave up her playthings.
Deprived of lessons,
I decided to run away.
Mother, I can't find Terr.
And my headphones are gone.
Use your bracelet!
If he's far away, it'll hurt him.
Put your bracelet on maximum, please.
No, mother...
You're pretty stupid.
Like all tame Oms!
You have a collar too.
It’s a fake, to fool the Traags.
What's that?
The Traags invented it.
What?
The Traags made it.
Listen!
"Valio, cycle, info 4...
"You will observe that Aklon research...
"in solid pernetrope...
"works the same as in plane pernetrope.
"Notice that we look for festation groups..."
Don't worry, it's not dangerous.
Where are you taking it?
- I don't know.
- Come with me!
My new friend took me to her people who lived hidden in the Big Tree. deep in an abandoned park.
As a silly tame Om, my first meeting with wild Oms was a failure.
Don't touch that case, it's a trap!
Since I brought the headphones of knowledge... the wizard opposed me at once!
We've brought 5 cases, Chief.
What? Is that all?
One of them was a trap and Speed is dead.
He knew it was a trap.
He's a tame Om.
He ran away with a Traag device.
It taught him to read Traag writing.
He knows what's in the cases?
In that one?
Color powder.
"Urtana is covered with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range is from 8 to 243 laiks...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible.
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laiks.
"Fixations blocks...
"offset ontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure..."
Why interrupt the info?
Traag knowledge is bad.
We don't need it.
We are not tame Oms.
It is great offense!
You must battle according to the Law.
Bring the combat animals!
You win. Stay with us Oms of the Big Tree.
You can be of use to us.
Tomorrow we go on an expedition.
It was my first expedition to steal Traag food.
We brought a great deal back.
Be brave, the Big Tree isn't far.
The Hollow-Bush bandits!
Look out!
Why attack us?
They're from the Hollow Bush.
Beware of them.
They are thieves from the other side of the park.
The Great Zarek
3000 cycles before Krowp...
"created the pyramidic civilization.
"From his tomb - they say he still animates...
"the ball of Life.
"Projectiles pierce him but he does not change.
"His mind travels through Ygam's skies...
"regularly ever since he led the Traags...
"to victory against the Jankos.
"This may well be how Meditation originated.
"Some believe that Zarek is immortal and...
"that from the flames of time he reappears in infinitely varied...
"whirling reality...
"to combat the Traags will to die.
"Actually
"driving out the Jankos made...
"the Traags develop a spirit of enterprise..."
The Oms are learning if only we had more headphones.
You know as much as the Traags.
I am barely learning to write.
Look.
Are you sure?
Did you read it right?
All the park walls read "de-om"!
What does it mean?
The Traags want to kill all the Oms!
Long ago...
I saw them de-om the park.
It was horrible!
But now on our tree, there's not much danger.
What will we do?
- It had to come.
- Anyway, we have time to prepare.
We'll post sentries.
They'll slaughter us... to punish us for stealing knowledge.
Let us pray to the Fantastic Planet.
Sentries will warn us when they come.
Tomorrow we shall see.
What are you doing on our land?
I came to warn you.
The Traags intend to de-om the park.
De-om!
You don't say!
How do you know?
One of us read it on the wall!
Can Big-Tree Oms read Traag writing now?
Don't listen to him!
It's a trap to get us out of the Hollow Bush!
Believe me, the Traags will de-om!
Take him away!
Someone go look at the walls!
Listen!
- Traags!
- Quiet!
I smell Oms here.
That vermin!
The Masters should... de-om more often!
It's not bad to have pet Oms...
They're fun.
But all those wild Oms...
They steal.
They're dirty and multiply appallingly fast.
Look...
A nest by the walk.
See... A whole colony.
Let's kill Them.
Chief is dead.
Stop weeping like children.
We must go where the Traags can't find us.
I know a place,
I'll take you there.
This road leads to an abandoned rocket dump.
We'll be safe there.
I regret that we de-om only every 3 cycles!
This killing proves it is not enough!
A Traag murdered!
It's unbelievable!
Are we so weak that Oms can kill us... so easily?
Wild Oms are much more numerous than we thought.
The body showed many... bites and wounds, said Traag who managed to escape slaughter.
Oms' bites were very numerous.
Every day wild Oms become bolder!
They multiply at a terrifying rate!
Master Sihn, it is disturbing to note that your Uva at Telez is not the only one that has been very difficult to de-om.
Two other Uvas...
Goham and Urtana... have had similar problems...
Near the murdered Traag we found... two surprisingly well organized lairs.
Most disturbing of all was... that in one of the lairs... cases were sorted according to contents.
But they were unopened.
How could the Oms know what they contained?
It is high time to take efficient measures!
I suggest we de-om twice a cycle.
I also request strict regulation of breeding... and selling of tame Oms.
Too often they turn wild again... and go join the throngs of Oms... living in parks and other isolated areas.
We must use the new, much-discussed de-om-ing devices at last.
We must exterminate all wild Oms.
And I ask you:
Should we keep our tame Oms?
We are wrong to believe Oms are merely vicious animals.
If we do, we may commit... an error of serious consequences.
Ygam had..
3 seasons equal to...
15 of our years.
The Traag rocket graveyard was abandoned.
There we built our city.
We planned to go to the Fantastic Planet.
Many tame and wild Oms came to join us.
Knowledge acquired from the headphones... enabled us to reduce...
Traag rockets... to our size.
"Trinur is a metal that palsifies Matwar
"top-grade reculid gives it a remarkable metallic shine."
We have succeeded, Terr.
Two rockets are for testing.
We will start with those.
- It's only a matter of work and time.
- We must hurry!
Om informers say... that a large-scale de-om-ing is near!
They may know where we are.
We must send up our two rockets at once... to see if we can live on the Fantastic Planet.
We cannot wait any longer!
Too bad. I can't go with you.
I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
I know you will build... a new world where Oms can be happy... far away from the Traags.
The Fantastic Planet will be our planet... a world for our children.
You must go!
You must hurry!
You must...
We had discovered the secret of the Traags.
The Spheres of Meditation there enabled Traags to meet... beings from other galaxies and hold strange nuptial rites.
This union gave them vital energy which they needed... and enabled them to reproduce.
We were afraid...
The statues feet might damage our rockets.
We found the only weak point of the Traags.
On Ygam, the de-om-ing was halted.
Never have the Traags been in such great danger!
Our entire civilization is threatened!
The Oms are taking revenge.
They have incredible scientific knowledge.
They must be stopped!
It may be too late.
Neither Oms nor Traags... will profit from destruction.
We must try to make peace.
"Since the Sihn era,
"the Traag civilization has undergone a remarkable evolution.
"The Oms, instructed by our philosophy and...
"technology...
"now provide the Traags with...
"dynamics and a new way of thinking.
Our planet now has two satellites, one natural and one artificial.
"The natural one, the Fantastic Planet...
"is kept for Traag Meditation.
"The artificial one was made by Oms.
They named it Terr.
"Oms live in huge cities on the various Uvas."

What on earth is that?
Good morning, General. l received your message, Mrs Hobday.

How lovely.
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.
Her late father served with me.
What does she burn in this? lt smells like sulphur.
Ridiculous! One can't make motor fuel out of sulphur!
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

Stop it this instant!
Children, this is Miss Price.
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins, all the way from London.
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?
The government are trying to evacuate children into the country.
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.
And l've had to find homes for all of them at very short notice.
These are the last three. All right, children. Pick up your things.
You're not suggesting l take these children into my house?
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.
Children and l don't get on. l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.
Be quiet.
Besides, l have important work to do.
Miss Price, you do have that entire house to yourself.
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice. l see. lf that is the case l shall take them into my house, with the understanding that you find another home as soon as possible.
Fine. Come along.
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable thing you are doing, taking in these poor unfortunates from the city.
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.
My parcel, please.
Bring your things inside.

- Yeah.
Not another house round here for miles.
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone. lt suits my purpose.
All right. Come along, everybody.
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names. l call him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with.
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.
Be very careful of everything in it.

You will wash yourselves otherwise there will be no supper. ls that clear?
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.
Please don't bother to whisper. l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.
You are planning to run back to London.
Please do your plotting elsewhere where l shan't have to listen to it. l don't know much about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as l do. ls there anything in particular that you fancy?
Sausage and mash, bubble and squeak, toad in the hole, fried fish...
Anything at all.
You won't find any fried foods in this house.

- No.
How do you keep your health?
Cabbage buds, rosehips, hyssop seed, elm bark, wattle yeast and stewed nettles.
''Dear Madam. With this shipment, the Emelius Browne

''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''
My first broom.
Time to go. Everybody up.
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.
Let's see how we fly this thing.
Here we are.
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''
Yes, of course.
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.
''A witch is always a lady unless circumstances dictate otherwise.''
''Take an easy, graceful sideways position.''
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.
There we are. How's that?
''To start up the broom, your basic formula:
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!'' l wasn't ready!
Now watch this.
Here we go. lt's going to be a little different this time.
All right. l know it's not ladylike.
What's the matter?
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.
That's the sort of thing witches do.
She don't fly good, do she?
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.
Look out!
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.
A witch she is, says you.
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.
She don't want anyone to know she's a witch, does she?
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.
And l intend to make the most of it. Come on.
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.
Very healthful, l'm sure!
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.
Lovely weather for flying last night.
Why did you say that, Charles?
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are. l see.
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.
Thank you. l should be most grateful if you didn't tell anyone.
Course there would have to be one or two little changes made round here. l mean, l'd like to see an occasional sausage on the table here.
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.
There will be no more of this wash, wash, wash, morning and night.
Anything else?
Now you mention it, l could do with a bit of lolly.
Lolly?
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.
The most accomplished of witches can't make money out of thin air.
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?
Be that as it may, you don't want us to blab, do you?
Have you considered what danger you might be in? l am a witch, you know.
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.
Very well, Charles.
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.
She can't even ride a proper broom.
Excuse me, Charles.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Oh, Charlie!
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!
Bother! l never seem to be able to manage toads.
Stop! Leave him alone!
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long. l'm just an apprentice witch.
Look out, Charlie!
You flaming brute! l'll teach you to do that to me!
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault. l'm afraid it's my fault.
Bad enough not being able to manage a broom. l can't perform a simple, basic spell.
You dared her to do it. l don't see why we can't all be friends.
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
Of course l'm not!
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.
You see, the work l'm doing is so important to the war effort.
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.
Most secret.
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.
Yeah. lf someone made it worth our while. l don't follow.
Simple. You give us something valuable to seal the pact.
Oh, Charlie, don't try to be clever again. lt's for our own protection, ain't it? lf we broke the pact, we'd have to give back the valuable object. l think it's an excellent idea. l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?
Bet that's not worth much.
Come with me.
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.
Well, l never had a rabbit.
Careful what you touch in here.
Rum sort of place, ain't it?
When l signed for my witchcraft course there was a free bonus, a marvellous travelling spell if you paid in advance. l think l'll give you that one.
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.
Poisoned dragon's liver?
You mean you poison the dragon or just the liver? lt comes prepared. lt's part of the school equipment.
Here we are. The travelling spell.
Everybody gather round.
All right now. Let's see.
Does any one of you have a bracelet or a ring?
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.
Never know when they might come in useful. Piece of blue glass.
Lovely bit of string.
Horseshoe nail.
What's that?
Knob from the bed upstairs.
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.
Yes, l think that will be all right.
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit, will you?
Hellebore, henbane, aconite... glow-worm fire, firefly light!
There. lsn't that pretty? ls that all we get?
This knob will now work the famous travelling spell.
And what's the famous travelling spell?
- How does it work?
- You take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs.
Then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left then in a firm, clear voice, tell it where you want to go and the bed will take you there.
Go on!
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the only one who can work the spell.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's right. My knob, weren't it?
That's the way the spell works.
Nice mess he'll make of things.
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.
Don't try anything with the bedknob till l get back.
''Dear Madam, it grieves me to inform you that we have been forced to close down our College of Witchcraft.''
''This means that we shall not be sending you the final lesson in which you expressed so much interest.''
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news. ls there anything we can do?
No. No, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.
Come with me, Paul.
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem to have to explain this to a six-year-old,
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead. l was expecting a very important spell in the mail from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.
What's that got to do with my knob? l must go to London immediately and see Professor Browne.
With his help, we may be able to bring this war to a successful end.
That is why l need the knob.
What is your decision?
Thank you, Paul. l brought this for your hair. lt may be windy.
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?
- Twice.
- Good.
Charles, put on something warmer.
The bed may travel quite fast. l'm not going. l'm staying right here.
But why?
All that rubbish about a travelling bed. lt won't work. That's why.
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.
We don't want to scratch the wall when we take off.
How's a ruddy big bed like that gonna get out of this room with those little windows? l don't know. There's a great many things about magic that l don't know.
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!
Just leave me out of it. l don't fancy making a fool of myself.
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.
Help me tidy up. We don't want to go to London with an unmade bed.
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve. l see. That's what my father used to call the age of not believing.
What's that supposed to be?
When you rush around
in hopeless circles
Searching everywhere
for something true
You're at the age of not believing
When all the make-believe
is through
That's Charlie to a tee.
When you set aside
your childhood heroes
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf
You're at the age of not believing
And worst of all you doubt yourself
Throw that away.
You're a castaway
where no one hears you
On a barren isle in a lonely sea
What's that? Poetry?
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
Everyone on the bed who's going.
You must face the age
of not believing
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob.
Until at last you start believing
There's something wonderful in you
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.
Repeat after me.
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...
Very good.
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.
..of Witchcraft, London.
When l say go, tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left.
- Left...
- That's it.
We'd better hold on tight.
The behaviour of the bed is something l'm not sure of.
Let me breathe a little.
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.
One... two... three...
- ls this London?
- Course it is!
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't. l don't see no Professor Browne.
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again. lt didn't work. lt was supposed to take us to Professor Browne.
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round, please.
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne. l am here to divert, to amuse, and, yes, even to help you.
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are... lt is what they seem to be. ls that not so?
That ain't the kind of professor l expected. l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.
What effect a little smoke is... with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning... and the scent of burning sulphur in the air.
And now, for my next trick, may l draw your attention to this solid piece of ordinary window glass, framed in an ordinary unprepared frame.
May l also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.
Now l shall place the framed glass in this brown, unprepared...
Unprepared, mark you...
Unprepared brown paper bag. l shall now attempt to drive the steel nail through the glass without breaking the glass.
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.
We shall see.
He ain't very good, even if he is a professor. l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.
Don't leave now and regret lost opportunities later.
You, young sir. Would you care to warble like the storied nightingale?
With this inexpensive device, you can charm the very birds down from the trees, like so.
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.
One copper coin of the realm.
Carrie, l'm very surprised at you wandering off like this.
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.
Don't work. l've been cheated! ls that Professor Browne? lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?
Would you be interested in the mating call of the Brazilian bird of love?
Very useful, eh?
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.
Professor Browne, l am one of your pupils.
My dear lady, you are indeed an ornament to the college.
- Splendid.
- Not at all. l was shocked when you closed down the college without that most important last lesson. l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.
But l must have the spell that comes with the last lesson!
The matter is closed. l bid you good day. l have an appointment at my club.
The matter is not closed!
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!
Here we are.
Will you get this child off my leg?
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Now l trust you'll behave more like a gentleman.
Look out!
There goes another rabbit.
What was all that about? l changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells.
My spell? From my school?
Not one of your best spells. lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.
But l don't understand. My spell?
They were just nonsense words from an old book.
They worked perfectly well for me.
They work for you?
Good woman! Some kind of destiny has brought us together.
You got these spells out of some old book, you say? l changed them round a bit. l gave them a bit of my own style, as it were.
The old sorcerers did have a bit of a tendency to waffle on.
But dear lady, l never thought l'd meet somebody like you.
What a treasure.
Mr Browne, will you please stick to the point. l would like to see this book immediately.
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.
Would you care to join me for luncheon?
We can discuss my ideas at the same time.
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.
You go round the other side. l always travel on the left.
Will you give the address to Paul, please?
May l ask how we are going to get there on this bed? Fly?
My dear Professor, with your own travelling spell.
The one you gave with the course as a bonus.
My travelling spell?
That works as well?
Just give the address, please.
8 Winchfield Road.
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.
Madam, is this vehicle safe?
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps, but then most good spells are.
We're here. l would never have believed it.
You must have given us the wrong address. Do you live here? ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate. l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.
Why should they do that?
This probably has something to do with it.
Merciful heavens!
You should be terrified at the very idea of living here.
You would have thought so. l am by nature a little bit of a coward.
But then l pondered. ln the perverse nature of things, this diabolical object is probably the best friend l've ever had. lt enables me, for the first time in my life, to live like a king.
Shall we go in?
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise, but with a charming touch of innocence.
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?
Dear lady, you are relentless.
The book is in the library. We shall proceed there after our cheese and wine.
Why do you keep the curtains closed?
So that we may enjoy the gentle glow of candle light.
More likely so's a copper don't peek in and catch you hiding out here.
Why don't you have a look round the house?
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.
Remember, this house does not belong to Mr Browne.
Mr Browne, where is that book? l must have that spell on substitutiary locomotion.
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.
Would you hold this, please?
What do you think of that?
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.
Think how successful l could be with an assistant who can really do magic.
Dear lady, have you ever considered entering show business?
- The what business?
- The theatre!
Pantomimes, village fairs, the seaside.
Brighton, Blackpool, follies on the prom. l have very important work to do.
Listen to me. We could make a packet.
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift
But I can speak the jargon
That will give your gift
the needed lift
You possess the know-how
And I command the show-how
Oh, how successful you could be
With me l'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
All you need to succeed
in your plan
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
And I'm your man
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman
I sell things that nobody can
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest
I'm your man
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine
Will you stop?
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
What are you reading?
''lsle of Naboombu.''
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.
These pictures prove it, don't it?
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things. l like it.
Now where is the book?
Well? Where is it?
At last, Mr Browne!
''The Spells of Astoroth.''
Of course.
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.
Does one's nose have to twitch like this?
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.
Miss Price, a word about your tactics. l don't mind being changed into a hawk or a tiger or something with dash.
But always a fluffy white rabbit? lt's intolerable!
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.
''The ancient art of...''
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are...''
But the rest of the book is missing!
Now you see why l closed down the college.
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book? l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.
He claimed that l'd given him a dud coin. l ask you!
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.
He got one half and l got the other.
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.
But if it still exists, there's only one place to find it.
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols
Society heirlooms with genuine gems
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos
Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames
Very interesting, but where do they sell books?
There's a little place around the corner.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
What l want is the other half of this book.
All in good time, my dear.
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,
The Fishmonger's Guidebook l'm looking for the other part of this.
A Victorian novel, ''The Unwanted Son''
- You don't understand!
- The History of Potting
The Yearbook of Yachting
The leather-bound
''Life of Attila the Hun''
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Artefacts to glorify a regal abode
Are hidden in the flotsam
in Portobello Road
Who do you think you are?
Tokens and treasures,
yesterday's pleasures
Cheap imitations
and heirlooms of old
Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished
In old Portobello...
This lady is looking for the other half of this book. lt's called ''The Spells of Astoroth''. l don't keep no torn or damaged books here.
What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road
There's another bookstore along here somewhere.
You don't expect to sell a piano like that, do you?
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road
Come on, ducks!
Come on, girls!
Lovely.
Oh, yeah, play the drums.
Closing time!
Bye!
Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload...
Hey, governor. Something for the lady friend? Nylons?
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?
Now you have my undivided attention.
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.
He wants to see you. You too.
Who is the Bookman? And what right has he got to order me about? l think we'd better ask questions later.
Excuse me.
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.
Why didn't you bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne, and half the Household Cavalry as well?
What's the bed for? lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.
Except for this knob, which is mine.
Bookman, there's been bad blood between us long enough.
Let this gift begin friendship anew.
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug. lsn't that the section of the manuscript we've been looking for?
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.
A charming young woman of my acquaintance.
Miss Price, l've been looking for this other bit a long time.
Mr Swinburne told me you were in the market making enquiries.
And here we are. l don't mind saying, to see it all together at last...
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne. ls that clear? lt's all like a jolly detective story or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?
We're both after the same spell.
You have one clue, l have the other.
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing seems to be for us to cooperate. l assume you're looking for the same thing l am.
May l?
This is quite a moment for both of us.
''Substitutiary locomotion, the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.
Here we are.
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are... engraved on the star that was always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''
But where are the words of the spell? l assumed they'd be in your half of the manuscript. l thought they'd be in yours!
Once again, a dead end. l shall never know the secret. lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.
Pity it's so small you can't read the writing.
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages in search for the spells that would make them more like humans.
The legend is that finally the animals rebelled at the experiment, killed Astoroth and stole many of his powers. lncluding the star with the spell on it.
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away and were never heard of again.
However, there is a final notation in my half of the book saying that in the 1 7th century a shipwrecked lascar was taken from the sea half mad with thirst and exposure to the sun.
Before he died, he swore he had seen an island ruled by animals.
Where?
There is, l regret to say, no such island. l looked for it in every chart.
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist. lt does too! Got my own...
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!
When he don't say nothing, he mumbles. l wish the child to speak!
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Please don't annoy me.
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it? lf it's all the same to you, l'd rather use my own.
Sentiment, you know.
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.
Observe the fundamental weakness of the criminal mind.
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.
He's up to something, you know.
Before your very eyes, l shall cause this bed and the occupants on it to disappear. l should like to see a cheap-jack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.
Bed, take us to the lsland of Naboombu.
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!
Beastly climate. l never did fancy the sea.
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course. l've never seen no island like this before. l'm afraid we may have fallen into the lagoon.
That's right.
Here we are on page three.
Oi, Mr Codfish!
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.
Not too bright, is he?
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.
Mr Codfish, where is the lsland of Naboombu?
You mean the land part? Oh, that.
Straight up. You can't miss it.
None of my business, of course, but l shouldn't go there if l were you.
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.
Trouble or not, we should be getting along.
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush? lt's really rather splendid down here. For you, my dear.
Thank you.
How pleasant...
Bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants and creatures
of the deep
We glide
Far below the rolling tide
Serene
Through the bubbly blue and green
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod
Think we're rather odd?
It's fun to promenade
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Look!
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants
and creatures of the deep
It's grand
When you're dancing on the sand
Each glance
Bubbles over with romance
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along through the water
Where we get along swimmingly
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny
Beautiful briny sea
Bravo!
Most exciting, most exciting.
You've won the ruddy cup.
Help!
This time l really caught a whopper!
People! Oh, no!
What scurvy luck.
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain. l used to be a bit of a seafaring man myself.
Many's the time l've shipped out of Portsmouth.
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.
Now stow it, mate.
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading? lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.
That means l've got to throw you all back. That's what to do.
Wait it minute! lt says here that anybody can see the king.
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?
Here in my book.
So it do.
But if you people knew what was good for you, you'd get yourselves all throwed back.
The king don't like people!
Nonetheless, we must see the king on an urgent personal matter.
Please lead the way.
But just don't say l didn't warn you. See?
Follow me.
Get out of here!
Yes. What can l do for you? l caught some people down at the sea lagoon.
They want to see the king.
Really? Well, we can't be bothered with that sort of thing now, can we? l don't know that l fancy this.
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer, l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.
No, no. You don't understand.
As everyone knows,
His Majesty is the world's greatest soccer player.
But due to a technical problem, the Royal Cup match cannot take place today.
And His Majesty had so set his heart on it!
Throw these... creatures back into the sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a moment! l can help!
Do you really think so? l'd be most grateful.
Do you know soccer?
Do l know anything about soccer?
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.
Three seasons with Manchester United...
Yes, yes. You'll do.
Come this way, please.
Mr Browne, are you certain you'll be all right?
Now what?
Not an ideal person in many respects, but Mr Browne is a very brave man.
Do you think he's done for?
Do you think so? l can't tell you how l appreciate this.
For some reason we have great difficulty finding referees round here. lf there be one thing we like, it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!
What's he got round his neck?
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.
Ah, yes.
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.
The Star of Astoroth!
You're to sit in His Majesty's royal box.
No littering, no chewing, no fruit or wrappers or sweets. Please.
Rise, please.
Loyal fans, this is official.
We have a volunteer referee.
Let the match begin!
He's still wearing it!
Right, Dirty Yellows, let's have a clean game.
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.
Weird sort of game they play here.
Hurry up! Get rid of it!
Gracious!
You're doing fine, matey.
Move it around.
Get on with the match!
- Foul!
- They're only animals.
That's no excuse for dirty football.
Ref, are you blind?
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.
The king makes them up as he goes along.
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he's moving.
Steady, matey. Move it around.
He almost had it then.
Looks like he's done for this time.
Don't just stand there! Head it in!
Stop... that... ball!
Goal!
Game's over. l win.
Let me give you a hand, matey.
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.
Please, let me help you on with your robe.
Why, yes. Thank you.
Can't have you catching cold, sire, can we?
Why, no.
Have you ever heard of something called the gypsy switch?
No, can't say that l have.
Remind me to tell you about it some time. l can't tell you when we've had such a good time.
We'll carry your memory in our hearts for a long while. l think it's time to leave.
Must you go?
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
Friendly lot.
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?
Your Royal Star!
They've stolen your Royal Star!
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you think this is?
Why didn't you say so?
Paul, put the knob on the bed.
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee. l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.
Got it.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work. l shall never get used to this thing.
Will you push the bed back into place, please? l think we could all do with a nice cup of tea.
No time. l've gone to a lot of trouble to find this spell. l'm going to try it immediately.
Mr Browne, kindly let me have your shoes, please.
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for? lf you'd been paying attention l should think you'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own. l must have inanimate objects to experiment with.
Makes sense, don't it?
Stand back, everyone. l need plenty of room. l want you all to be absolutely quiet.
Mr Browne, you have the Star of Astoroth, l believe.
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky. lt's all right, Mr Browne. l should have realised that it would be impossible to take an object from one world into another. lf only l would have had the sense to remember the words on that star.
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.
Why don't you and l nip out and get something for supper?
And l might conceivably call into the pub for a pint to steady my nerves. l do know the words, Miss Price.
How can you know the words when Miss Price doesn't?
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.
The prime minister
has told the nation
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.
That was the news. l might have been able to do something about this. lt's out of your hands now, my dear. lf only l could have remembered those words. lt's maddening.
Why don't someone ask me?
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember those kind of words.
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee''?
- How do you know that?
- Easy.
Says so right here in my book.
You mean it was there in your book all the time?
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Nothing happened!
Am l doing something wrong?
Well, it does seem a bit old-fashioned.
After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Substitutiary locomotion
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see
Substitutiary locomotion come to me
Now!
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
I don't want locomotiary substitution
Or remote intransecory convolution
Only one precise solution is the key
Substitutiary locomotion it must be
Substitutiary locomotion
Lovely substitutiary locomotion
You've made substitutiary history
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee
Mr Browne, what is going on here? l haven't the foggiest.
How do you do?
Shall we?
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear? l'm not responsible for its behaviour.
Obviously not, my dear.
Paul, what on earth are you doing?
Having a jolly good time, that's what.
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.
But we must do something.
Didn't l give you my all-purpose cut-off spell?
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!
Mr Browne, will you please control your shoes?
Dear lady, l very much fear that we have nothing under control.
Do you mind?
Now, who would like some more of my lovely sausages and mash?
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie? l've already had two helpings.
- l'm full.
- Me, too.
At least somebody wants some.
Cheer up, my dear. This should be something of a celebration. l'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be much to celebrate.
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.
You just need a little more practice.
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the spirits like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice and a touch of genius.
Never happened to me before. l don't usually juggle with cats under my feet.
Look! She's laughing!
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear. l've just come by to bring you the good news.
Mr Bistlethwaite, who brings the milk, you know?
He's promised to take the children in!
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.
Put a bit of colour back in their cheeks.
Why, what's the matter? l thought you'd be pleased.
You told me yourself that you had no time to take care of children.
Circumstances have changed somewhat.
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?
Of course. You do want him to stay with us, don't you, Miss Price? l suppose l hadn't really thought about it.
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne? lt's all rather sudden! l don't quite know what to say.
Then l'll leave you two to talk it over. l'll come back in the morning!
Good night! lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going to be our father now, aren't you?
We are rather rushing things, aren't we?
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things besides you children to think about.
Yes. As a matter of fact l should have left ages ago. l must get a train back to London tonight. lt's rather an important matter. l'd like to tell you about it, but it's a little bit hush-hush.
Sort of a secret.
Well... if... lf l've been any sort of help to you, l'm pleased.
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you. l've enjoyed being with you.
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope that we shall meet again.
Some day.
When all this war business is over.
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.
Eglantine and Emelius: illusionists extraordinary!
Just think how that will look on the poster.
The children are going to miss you.
- You really think they will?
- Yes.
Well, l shall miss you. All of you. lf l don't go now you might never get rid of me.
Goodbye, Carrie.
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Do you want me to come down to the station with you?
No, no. You stay here and look after everybody.
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.
Good night.
Out you go, Cosmic.
Hello?
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy
in that house at this very moment?
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,
and a coward.
No, Fräulein, this is not the invasion, just a little exercise.
A minor raid to induce panic and to spread a little mischief.
When you English get it through your head that the German forces can land whenever and wherever we please, perhaps you will consider reasonable peace.
Not bloody likely!
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him. l must say, it's very tempting.
Colonel, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit? l said, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit?
Be quiet, please.
Filigree, apogee, epogee...
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.
Would you kindly fetch my notebook from the workroom?
Righto.
Silence!
We have work to do. l am sorry, but l must send all of you some place where you will no longer be a nuisance.
As the words sell the tune
And the moonbeams the moon
All I need to succeed in my plan
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
Eglantine!
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.
Confound it, can't women ever learn to file things properly?
Here it is.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.
Filigree... apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Come along. For once in your life, you've got to believe in something.
That's it. Good lad.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
What's the use of putting us in that draughty castle? lt's quite chilly.
The colonel believes when a British female decides to become a nuisance, she can become the greatest nuisance in the world, and l'm inclined to agree with him.
You need a lesson in manners. lf l had my notebook, l'd make certain you'd learn a few.
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!
Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.
We could strip him down and grease him with soap.
No, it's no good. We can't do it. l could have told you that in the first place. lf we can't get Paul out we'll just have to think of something else.
What about that spell that makes things move about?
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things? l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!
He's on his way to London.
Mr Browne? lf you are Mr Browne, would you get off my lap? lt is Mr Browne! lt is you!
You didn't think that l could do that spell, did you? l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?
What's wrong with the substitutiary locomotion spell?
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.
We can't let these so-and-sos get away with their beastly little raid.
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
Let's hope you haven't forgotten the spell.
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.
Probably not magic, but it might make you feel more at home.
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.
Treguna... mekoides... trecorum... satis dee.
Look!
Sound the advance!
Just in time for the kick-off.
Steady on the left.
Victory for England and St George!
Like a Lord Mayor's show!
Pikemen, hold your distance.
Treguna mekoides
and trecorum satis dee
Blimey!
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.
Come on, lads! After me.
Good shooting, bowmen!
Well caught, sir. Very good.
Knock his block off! That's it!
Mr Browne, make those children take cover!
Are you still there, Colonel? l thought you'd be on your way by now.
You see? Things may not be so easy for you after all.
Goodbye, Colonel!
Eglantine.
Dear Mr Browne.
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.
There they are, lads! l said something was afoot!
All right. Drive them into the sea.
Firing positions. Both sides.
All right, men. Hold your fire. l think we've taught the Hun a lesson.
He'll think twice before coming back here again. lt's tragic. All your spells, your equipment. All gone.
Still, l was able to perform some small service first.
That mean you ain't gonna be a witch no more? Never?
No, Paul. l realised some time ago that l could never be a proper witch.
Was it that first magic moment when you laid eyes on me?
No. lt was the day my poisoned dragon's liver arrived. l knew that anyone who felt the way l did about poisoned dragon's liver had no business being a witch.
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so. lt's much too dangerous being a civilian.
Take care of yourself, guv. l'll do that. And l'll be back before you've grown an inch taller.
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.
Well, here we go.
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.
Parade, by the right, quick march!
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.
Still got this, ain't l?

What is it like, the planet we're approaching?
Nothing but ice and snow.
A barren desert of whiteness.
Scan it with our computer waves.
The enemy's weapons may be hidden beneath its surface.
Aha!
Looks like the cops.
As Thor, chief of the imperial police,
I order you to surrender at once
Stella, you cheap smuggler
I am police robot M.
You have the right to remain silent.
Go for hyper space.
Let's hope this star-buggy stays together.
What's our chances?
40% total disintegration..
30% molecular ignition..
..20% gamma contamination.
You are very reassuring
I assume that means - we have a 10% chance of making it.
Not really!
3% structural collapse
Alright Alright!
Just keep on course and get ready to reenter normal space.
Ready when you are.
We've done it!
We've done it!
Not quite. Look!
The Nutrant star!
If it gets a hold on us, it'll crush us.
Prepare to release
Ath-Power stage.
Eject!
Eject!
Ha Ha!
We made it.
Plot us a new course, so that cop cant find us.
Even as you speak.
It's been taken care of.
There's the border of the haunted stars.
If we'd traveled one second further, we would have wound up right beside them.
What in the universe is that?
It's a spaceship.
No, its a launch.
Their power is totally down.
Maybe they're wounded, to weak to send a signal.
I'm gonna have a look.
What's the radiation level?
Normal.
The hull isn't damaged.
I'm going inside.
Is everything alright?
Yes!
Wait a minute..
There's someone here.
He looks like he's hurt pretty bad, but he's alive
I'll try to get him back to the ship.
I'll help you bring him aboard.
He's dehydrated.
Suffering from exhaustion.
But the launch was full of supplies.
Everything he could have needed.
He's also in chock.
He keeps talking about monsters..
..Red monsters
He wants us to alert someone..
Urgently.
Who?
The Emperor of the first circle of the universe.
It's the emblem of the chief officers of the imperial navy.
I'd say red hot potatoes for small time smugglers on the run like us.
We'll, what do we do?
You go to prison, Stella star.
Your leap through hyperspace didn’t fool us.
Your friction trail was easy to follow.
Hehehe..
You are completely surrounded by fighter ships.
This time you've won.
We surrender.
There won't be a next time, Stella Star!
Don't worry.
We'll get out of this.
My Lord!
Yes. What is it Ellrik?
They found one damned survivor.
Right now, the imperial shuttle ship has taken him to their medical centre.
But his brain seems to be thoroughly damaged
He will be of no help to them, to find the ship.
Mhmm..
Come to me, Golem!
I have a simple task for you.
You must not fail me.
Therefore, the great machines of the central operating system..
..of imperial justice hereby sentence you,
Akton, of ninth Vega..
..to 220 years hard labor in the prison planet of Ze-com the 3rd.
As for you, Stella Star, having considered all the arguments..
Studied all the Video-tapes, the accusations..
..we condemn you to forced labor for life..
..in the penal colony..
..of Nocturne the 2nd
This session is hereby adjourned.
Throw the radium into the furnace.
Careful now.
I said let's go, move!
Faster!
Move, Let's go!
Will you step it up!
Here! You can move faster than that!
Careful with that Radium.
Will you move!
Move down those stairs!
Throw it the furnace!
Do what I tell you!
Where do you think you are.
We haven't got all day!
Alright, 5 minutes of rest
Move quickly now!
Prisoners get back to their posts!
Let's go!
Come on quickly now!
Let's go!
I've been at this for 12 straight hours..
..the radiation will burn my skin off.
Were not slaves.
You'd better work.
If you don’t want the taste of the burning of their energy whips too.
But there must be a way to escape.
There will be a way, you know.
Blow ups happen.
If I could only succeed in overfeeding the furnace.
But overfeed it with what?
Energy!
Then a gun ray could be enough.
Planing an escape!
This is what you're gonna get, lady!
You can drop the riffle-ray.
Now turn around.
You!
I bet you never expected to see me here.
And you too.
Poor Stella.
Your escape efforts have been wasted.
OK.
I've lost again.
We were sent to free you, your sentence has been cancelled.
Have you both gone mad?
I only have logic animotion circuits.
No room for craziness.
Well, I've been assigned to a top secret imperial mission, we must now leave and set Akton free.
There, he's yours
My gift to you.
Would I lie to you?
Look, it is the imperial flagship.
Akton, you are gonna meet some real royalty.
He's here!
There is his holographic image.
His Highness; The emperor of the first circle of the universe.
I come to you because my faithful robot,
Elle, has told me..
..that you are the only one who could save us.
You know, you must be the best pilot in the whole galaxy..
..and you Akton, the best navigator.
Stella, our galaxy is split..
..into 2 waring factions.
Our own and the one ruled by the evil count..
..Zarth Arn!
From the league of the dark worlds.
Recently we've begun to receive troublesome reports from our spies among the league.
They have informed us that the count has created a weapon..
..a new, limitless weapon.
A Weapon so vast, so huge..
..that it would take a whole planet to conceal it.
That is why we sent the mission ship.
Did they find the planet?
The ship came so close..
..so close..
..to discovering the counts secret..
.. when it was suddenly attacked by a horde of unknown monsters.
We had assumed it was destroyed, we lost all hope.
Until you found the launch from that ship.
And now, with the utmost secrecy..
..you must sail to the haunted stars.
You must find that ship.
Find the counts secret planet and destroy it.
There's something else.
When you complete the mission..
.. search for the commander..
..of that missing ship.
He was my only son.
The first possibility is the Origa system.
Also know as the worlds asleep.
But this system is still within our galaxy and we should've found it by now.
The same also applies to the white sun of Ohzon so only the third possibility remains:
The heart of the haunted stars.
An unknown planet named..
Euraphas!
Well, shall we begin our search?
Lets go!
The distance we must travel is enormous.
By using hyperspace, what would normally take 2 months to reach
We should do in 2 hours.
Everything ready?
Ready! Right!
Every time I go into hyperspace
I get nervous.
Prepare for re-entry to normal space.
We've arrived!
Its not very far from here.
You can reach by using the space shuttle.
Thor and I will wait for you there.
Hidden in that canyon.
So that were ready in case of another surprise attack of the count.
That sounds fine with me.
Is there air out there?
Yeah. Yeah you can breathe.
Alright. lets go!
Follow me!
I'm sure you can operate the shuttle ship.
The controls are easy!
Now watch your step right here.
Take care.
You alright?
You bet. Lets go.
Don't you think were a little low?
I haven't been programmed to walk on water.
Ohh me. water makes me so nervous
Everything makes you nervous.
It's the launch.
Lets land.
OK! Take it in easy.
Shuttle to star-ship!
We are landing now.
Roger. Out.
My seat-belt’s stuck.
Oh Elle, come on!
Take it easy, I'm coming.
Look at that!
Amazing!
It's almost buried.
The impact was tremendous.
I doubt if anyone could have survived.
The nuclear exhaust ports have been gutted by fire.
We'd better look around.
What's that?
I don't know.
Seems to be a planetary artifact.
Well, it certainly is an antique.
Looks like some sort of Laser spear.
This planet is inhabited.
We must be very careful.
We are in the evil counts domain.
These stars are extremely far and remote, even for him.
Probably they've set up a fully independent kind of civilization.
We're wasting time. We'd better start looking for the missing crew.
Come on. Lets go this way.
Look!
Amazons on horseback.
I hope they are friendly.
We'll soon find out.
Take my revenge.
Kill 'em.
Die robot.
You'll pay for this -
All of you!
Don't make us kill you.
Come on!
Stop!
There is no escape.
Take your hands off of me.
Let me go.
Get your hands off of me.
Let me go.
Queen Querrelia. This is the spy we captured.
She came through the forbidden sea.
You're a spy.
As the men from the launch were too.
But nothing is going to stop the count anymore.
Even if you had passed by this world..
..you'd never be able to discover the counts planet.
Two packs of murdering guardians are there to watch and protect it from intruders.
..and now:
Put her into the mind probe.
No! No!
Hold it right there!
Elle!
Release her or I'll blast your queen.
I mean it.
Come on now.
Don’t you people move or you are dead.
Give me the trouble and I'm gonna clean out your sinuses real good lady
Now you stand there.
Ok, Close the door.
Don’t you follow us now.
Stop them!
Stop them!
Behind you!
Come on, lets go!
Elle you're terrific.
I didn't know you had it in you.
Where's the release mechanism?
It's jammed!
Take cover!
Here goes the last shot.
Full power!
Come on, lets go!
Hurry! Hurry!!
Guardian..
..take my revenge.
Kill them.
Look!
Whoa!
Run for your life!
There! That narrow passage in the rocks.
Come on Stella, run!
Hurry!
Oh! Elle!
We better move!
The amazon air-fighters will be here soon.
Quick, to the ship!
They're attacking.
I'll man the laser-canon.
Specter 7..Fire!
Ok, get ready.
Here they come.
Power is up to full battle speed.
You!
Why don't you come back now?
Here they come. Specter 3.
Alright.
We've got them!
Fire! Fire!
Yeah!
One more.
There's one more!
We've got 'em.
Watch out on the right.
We're down from 6 to 5.
Get ready.
More to the left.
Steady.
Then fire 5.
Then 6.
Fire the laser-canon, robot.
Fire!
Yeah! Hahaa!
We got it!
We're holding.
Now!
8 ships approaching from the right. Fire!
Alright, we've won.
We did it.
I found the positions to both the 3rd launch and the mother-ship.
The mother-ship is closest so we'll check it out first.
It's here.
On the 3rd planet of the next solar system.
I've never been there.
What's it like?
Red fogs, high winds, low gravity.
The air is breathable.
And the atmospheric conditions are stable.
However..
The entire planet is covered with ice and snow.
And you must be extremely careful when the sun sets.
The temperature drops thousands of degrees.
And in an instant, everything freezes over.
What a terrible crash.
No-one could have survived.
Do you see any signs of the emperors son?
If he's in the middle of all this
I don't even know if his own mother would recognize him.
Then it's all over.
There's no hope of ever finding the counts secret fortress.
There's still the third launch.
It's probably lost out in the stars, who knows?
Anyway, it's useless to raise false hopes.
It's been too long.
And this galaxy is wild and hostile.
Come on Elle, lets go back to the ship.
We'd better hurry.
We're running out of time and our power-packs are nearly finished.
Let's get rid of them.
It's gonna be a long walk back.
My feet are already cold.
It's times like these i'm glad to be a robot.
What's the matter with you, Akton?
Well, I'm just refining my powers.
And what's your problem, ships-computer, huh!
Is everything alright with Stella and Elle?
I'm not worried about them.
I'm just waiting.
Your waiting is over.
At last Thor.
You have some good news for me?
Yes Excellency.
I have killed the alien pathfinder..
..and taken over this ship.
What of Stella Star?
And that tin policeman.
This planet will take care of them, Excellency.
Good!
And I await your immediate arrival.
Elle, how much further?
We should be close.
Just a few more radiants.
Ships-computer!
Why aren't the main engines firing?
There is a malfunction.
A malfunction?
Where?
I am not programmed for this malfunction.
Akton!
We're here!
Akton! Thor!
Let us in. The sun is setting.
That's exactly why I'm not letting you in.
Soon you'll be dead and
I'll be gone from this planet.
Have you gone crazy? Open this hatch!
No!
Where's Akton?
Akton is dead.
And I'm leaving to join Count Zarth-Arn..
..as the prince of the League of Darkness.
Thor, a traitor?
I cannot believe it.
I cannot trust my own logic circuits anymore.
He fooled me too.
It's no use. We're gonna freeze.
Maybe not.
Maybe I can save you.
Let's stop here.
Now you lie down in the snow, face up.
Okay.
Now give me your hand so I can monitor your temperature.
I can use my energy to keep your heart working.
You'll be in a state of suspended animation.
Elle!
As an opponent, I always knew you were programmed to never give up.
Which was infuriating.
But now that quality..
..must be..
..best.
You are the most faithful companion a woman ever had.
And I too, respect you, Stella.
You are the nicest human being I've known.
Now, maybe, is a good time to use your ancient system of prayer.
And hope it works for robots, as well.
Goodbye my friend.
Goodbye for now, Stella.
You were expected here hours ago!
I've been delayed by a malfunction.
I don't tolerate malfunctions..
..or inefficiency here in my realm
How long will the delay be?
I think a very long time.
You shouldn't try taking off without asking me first.
This time I'll make sure you are dead.
I'll fix you.
Alright Akton.
This is it.
Say goodbye.
What?
Stop!
Put down the gun.
Stop!
No-one can survive these deadly rays.
Those deadly rays will be your death.
Elle?
Elle, do you read me?
This is Akton.
I've taken over the ship.
Do you read me?
Her pulse rate is 16.
She may survive if you can use your powers and bring her back slowly.
Careful now.
Close the hatch.
Look! It's working!
She's going to make it.
Come on Stella!
Whats wrong?
The main engines will not fire.
Thor must have tried everything.
What are we gonna do now?
So..We get out of one mess..
..just to find ourselves in another.
Not necessarily.
What do you mean?
We are stuck!
Even the transmitter is out of order.
We can take off immediately.
Take off?
How?
The ship is not operating, simply because I borrowed this reactor.
Then you knew about Thor.
Yes I did.
So you see into the future.
All these years you never told me.
Think of all the trouble
I might have avoided
You have tried to change the future.
Which is against the law.
So therefore, I can tell you nothing.
Let's find the 3rd launch.
Akton, you are something else!
Yes.
Time is running out.
Lets go!
We're arriving.
That's the planet Demundia.
There in barren land and wast emptiness we'll find the 3rd launch.
Somethings wrong.
Everything has stopped.
What's happening?
Power failure!
My circuits!
My circuits are failing.
We've been hit.
By an energy beam.
I am out of control.
Look!
What is it?
It must be the Counts weapon!
Oh my head, oh!
Fire, you stupid robot!
Fire!
What's happening?
Here, let me help you.
The attack is over.
You'll be alright.
I thought I was gonna go insane.
We've just survived an attack of the most powerful weapon in the entire galaxy.
If Akton's calculations are correct we should find the launch this way.
In a crater just over..
There!
Oh me!
Don't say it. Don't say
I know..
Steam makes you nervous.
No, no! Not really.
Why should I be nervous?
There is nothing to be afraid of round here.
Looks totally wrecked but it's definitely the third launch.
I'd better go down.
No, I insist.
Time for a little robot-chauvinism.
You stay here.
Be careful Elle.
You do not have to worry about me!
Release her!
Let me down!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Don't.. Don't..
Relax.
Take it easy.
I'll cut you down.
There.
You're free.
That was a little too close for comfort.
Come on.
Come on!
We rest here.
This is safe.
Who are you?
This is an energy-shield mask.
And the amount of energy is limited.
My name is Simon.
I'm the only survivor from the wreck of an imperial mission.
Are you really?
We've been searching for you all through these damned haunted stars.
Why?
The emperor's orders were to find the Count's phantom planet and to destroy it.
So you know about the monsters?
Yes I do.
But it's useless.
We did not succeed in find the planet either.
And now there's no time left.
The cavemen will waiting for us.
Alright, stay very close and very quiet.
Oh, this way looks safe.
This way.
Simon!
No!
Akton!
You alright?
Akton, thank god you got here in time.
You must've known all along.
By the way, this is Simon.
The only survivor from the imperial mission.
We owe you our lives.
Now maybe..
..with your help, we can still find the Count's phantom planet
Lets go aboard your ship and continue on at once.
There's no need to continue.
Have you gone crazy?
That's our primary mission: To find the planet and destroy it.
I know, but we've already found it.
Think about it.
Then you'll understand that this is the Count's planet.
Remember what the Amazon queen said:
A planet occupied by two packs of evil defenders.
The first we met while in space.
The red monsters.
And the second..
Right here. The Troglodytes.
And there’s no question about it.
This is the planet!
This?
That's incredible.
I was here and I didn't even realise it.
There's no way you could have.
Anyway, we proceed at once and destroy all that machinery.
Right?
Right.
There is the door that'll take us to the machinery.
This is the Counts secret domain.
The very heart of the phantom planer.
From here he plan to control the entire universe.
This is incredible.
Where is everybody?
Everything is set in our destiny.
Soon you'll know all the answers.
This will take us to operation headquarters.
After you, my dear.
Here's the nerve center of the entire operation.
This is unbelievable.
Fantastic.
Pre-programmed computers.
They could run forever.
All these power modules, what are they for?
This is the force that projected the red monsters into space.
Then this is the way they produced real monsters?
No. Not real.
The monsters never existed.
These machines discharged mental projections of monsters in our brains
There's the control-panel.
Well, destiny must take it's course.
No, we can't allow this to happen.
We must destroy it, at once.
You've been very lucky.
And clever.
You survived every trap that I'd lay for you.
Then I realized that your success would become my triumph.
How much time is left, Captain?
Half a quadrant to go, My-lord.
You hear?
In less than an hours time
All that'll be left of this planet
Will be ashes and cosmic dust.
Forever.
Then you will be among the dead.
The emperor will make you pay for this.
The Emperor?
I forgot to inform you..
..that the Emperor will be blown to pieces along with the rest of you.
Yes!
I told the emperor that we had found you on this planet.
He's on his way here now, at top speed.
He'll get here just in time..
..to join the fireworks.
I'm sorry, your highness.
You've lost.
Highness?
Forgive me Stella.
But in the beginning
I didn't know whose side you were on.
And after-wards
I didn't know how to tell you
Yes, he is Simon, son of the Emperor and heir to the throne.
You two are to prevent them from leaving this room at all cost.
You will stay with them until the end.
Kill them..
..if you have to.
Now it will be just a matter of waiting.
An hour goes by quickly.
We've got to get past those golems.
Yes, but how?
Have faith.
And never give up hope.
Look out!
We are now approaching Demundia.
All crewmen to landing stations.
All crewmen to landing stations.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
You and the prince will live.
Akton, you've got to get up.
We must get away from here.
I shall remain here.
Please get up, please.
I'm no longer useful at this time.
You're talking nonsense.
You can heal yourself in no time at all.
No.
I must obey destiny.
Akton!
We'll carry you.
Go.
It's your duty.
You must live.
I can't.
I can't leave you.
You're the only human-like friend I ever had.
I don't understand. You never die.
Stella, Stella.
I've accomplished the mission.
Yes, but I..
Others are coming.
Even as I speak they'll rescue you.
Don't worry.
I'll live forever.
Now go.
Go.
Father!
We must leave at once.
48 seconds left to the explosion.
We've got to get out of here.
It's true father.
The Count has mined the planet with nuclear charges.
We're all about to die.
You know something, my boy?
I wouldn't be emperor if I didn't have some powers at my command.
Imperial battle-ship!
Holt..
..the flow of time.
In the space of 3 minutes
Every molecule on this planet will be immobilized.
But after the third minute
The green ray loses it's power.
Time will flow once again.
And everything will explode.
Three minutes are enough, father.
Now, the Count believe that we are dead.
That our armies have dispersed.
And that we have no leader.
He is supremely confident that he can overcome us with the greatest of ease.
Well then.
Now is the time to surprise him.
We will attack his headquarters before his fleets can join him.
If we succeed in this we could save billions of lives.
Gather together all our legions.
Sir!
And order the attack.
By sunset,
I'll be the new Emperor.
And I will be the master of the whole universe.
Kill them!
Enemy arriving with torpedoes.
Prepare for attack.
Kill! Kill!
Over there.
We've got them, father.
It's working
Kill!
Kill!
Kill them!
Let's squad. Come on
Over there, quickly.
Now let's give the Emperor a great reception.
Put in use the mightiest weapon.
The doom-machine.
Send it off to towards the Emperor's capital world and destroy the emperor's imperial planet.
Zarth-Arn!!
Yeah!
It's over.
We're finished.
We've lost.
No.
No, there's still a way.
There's one solution left.
I'm afraid we're forced to use it.
What?
Starcrash!
Four dimensional attack.
Yes!
If we can re-enter space at the precise moment the impact of surprise upon the Count will be so overwhelming that he cannot halt us.
But father, there is not a weapon powerful enough.
Oh yes, there is.
The floating city.
The floating city.
Yes, yes I know.
Although we destroy it's hope, it's future..
..I'm afraid we must sacrifice it.
By setting it towards the Count's fortress.
It's our only way.
Now you must help me.
Both of you.
Go!
And direct it's course.
Zoltan!
Yes, my-lord.
Now set the doom-machine against the imperial space station itself.
How long will it take?
15 minutes.
The set it in motion.
I want to wipe out the Emperor from the whole of the universe.
Yes, my-lord.
When do we reach the floating city?
In less than 2 minutes.
Right. I'll check the docking facility.
Right!
Everything checks out OK.
Look!
The floating city.
Already evacuated.
The technicians have already set the charges and freed the atomic engines.
If everything goes smoothly
I'll try to eject myself as soon as I re-enter space.
But surely I'll come with you!
No, no, no!
It's more important that you stay here to rescue me once this is all over.
Alright.
I'll stay.
But I cannot let you go alone.
In fact our best scientists have spent the last few hours reconstructing an old friend of yours.
Elle!
You can't keep a good robot down.
This is incredible, they rebuild you.
But how?
You look marvelous.
Very carefully.
And they used the latest components.
I feel like a new machine.
Go now. Quickly!
The survival of our galaxy is in your hands.
This will take us directly to the control-room.
We have a lot to do in a very short time.
Get ready to ease out of orbit.
This doesn't make you nervous, does it?
I've never flown a city before.
Well, leave it to me.
Build up maximum energy.
We must leap through the very heart of the stars.
Prepare to transit. 8 degrees.
Ok. I'm ready.
My-lord!
Yes Ellrik?
A floating ship is about to crash into us.
What?
Zoltan!
Yes my-lord.
Destroy the floating ship approaching us.
It can't be done.
It's too close.
There it is. Dead-ahead.
Alright!
The Count's fighters.
We've got to evade them.
All systems prepare for full power.
Let's lock in these controls.
Move it out. Quick.
Right!
Let's go!
Come back, you fools.
You cowards.
Come back and fight.
My-lord?
Yes!
Come, or you'll be destroyed.
You stay here.
Go!
Let's get out of here or there won't be enough left of me to put back together.
You can bet on that!
Circuits, don't fail me now.
Zarth-Arn!! Zarth-Arn!!
It's Simon. Simon!
We're over here.
Stella. Stella!
And welcome home.
Stella!
Simon!
Ah Stella.
Simon.
Is that so.
Well..
It's done
It's happened.
The stars are clear.
The planets shine.
We've won.
Oh, some dark force no doubt
Will show it's face once more.
The wheel will always turn.
But for now it's calm.
And for a little time..
..at least..
..we can rest.
CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING
Most of the time, it started like this...
Practical Treatise of Magic
Fill this out, please...
But, the next morning...
This is yours, miss.
Thank you sir.
No, I don't drink coffee.
It's not for me.
It's for you this time.
Here Lil, for your collection
This one's from Borneo
Java?
And the last one?
Klimanjaro.
Some people have the fun
The past?
No. Past, future.
House of God, liberation from prison.
The Chariot.
New start. Conquest.
May I?
You woke up lucky today.
Oh, Death!
No. It's positive there.
Movement. Change. The end... becoming radiance, triumph.
Conquest. The Sun.
How useless!
Don't burn yourself
You do me, now.
The Past. The Hanged Man
What is below is above.
Your future is behind you.
And you plunge into the depths... of night...
My future is...
Your grandfather the hermit, protects you.
You don't move. You don't advance.
You advance, but in total immobility.
Stagnation!
Triumphant stagnation.
At least triumphant.
Consequently, my future is in the present.
Exactly.
That's fine. I like paper...
I like the smell of wax.
Another puff?
Now?
It'll be better tomorrow.
Let's hope so
Well, let's go... home.
The cigarette?
I'll keep it.
Back to literature.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you please smoke discreetly.
The children are really noisy.
Is the white elephant back?
No, he's gone to Australia.
The naive larks and the ladies of Flajolie are out.
It's like the spider.
Death with a blue ribbon.
In front of the mirror?
In front of the mirror
July 11th
Don't let your cats out.
I'm sorry. I woke you?
I thought it was the ones who are after me.
Don't you think you need a bed?
I've to wash.
A shower...Must take a shower.
You  had 3 calls while I slept.
First door on the left.
It's crazy!
My last African safari... was really crazy.
We were dying of heat.
Every day in the savannah chasing animals.
I had a hoa consquitador.
A hoa consquitador.
That quite adore me.
He wasn't dangerous,
I'd put him around my neck.
When the natives killed the tiger, the biggest one they said.. it was the tiger of Bengal!
Bengal the area of Africa we were in. You know it?
It's a blue and brown bird.
The Pigmy Emperor had invited me... but Zouha the Giantess was jealous.
She wanted to marry the emperor who'd given me the tiger skin.
But since the Pigmy king had giben it to me...
No bear skin?
Zhuba wanted my skin. My skin.
So, I escaped.
I almost croaked coming back from the jungle.
I lived through hell.
I lost my hair, all over, plucked clean.
I was scared to death.
I was traumtoed.
Tomatoed?
Yeah freaked out.
I was invited to Hong Kong.
A cool place,
I'll tell you about it.
There was a Japanese guy who did acoopuncture.
He did it to me.
I stayed for a month.
Afterwards my hair came back.
All red at first, and then normal again.
And then I came back.
Who's that?
That'^s Gregoire... alias Gýilou.
A distant cousin from the Luberon
We were childhood lovers.
We had innocent little games.
Playing doctor and all.
On sundays we'd get married in the gras behind the rectory. naked as worms, serious as popes.
Now Guilou's coming back.
He's written. I'm waiting.
But he wants us to wear white and go to churtch.
What's this relic?
A spare forget-me-not.
Forest of knots?
- The forget-me-not of the poor.
It isnt't forget-me-not it's a daisy.
It was a daisy.
We've to take care of that.
Can you take alcohol?
You can't take alcohol?
No, it's OK!
I have a first-aid certificate.
How'd you get that?
They were after me.
Or I thought it was them.
I fell down. I was afraid.
But who are they? Afraid of what?
I'd been hired to work in a house... then, 2 days ago...
-before it was fine-
2 days ago, I found in my room, a bracalet with the  name of a foreign girl,
I thought it belonged to the firl who was there before me.
So I took it to my boss.
When he saw it he turned pale.
I thought he'd hit me.
He locked himself in his office with his wife.
She was crying, he was shouting and I listened.
Then the other woman came.
So, I left.
I moved a bit away and poked around... in the drawers... and then, in one drawer,
I found... two passports with foreign names, and one was the name on the bracelet.
But the photos were ripped out.
Yesterday. when I wanted to continue... everything was locked, the drawers, the closets...
I tried to force a drawer... and they came in.
I ran away, and now they're after me.
Who are they?
My boss and the two women.
What did you do in the house?
Nanny.
There were children?
Of course!
How many?
One.
A little girl?
Yes.
How old was she?
Oh little, 7 or 8.
And the women?
Were they dark or fair?
Dark and fair.
But I don't know about them.
They were very secretive.
What did he look like?
Gloomy?
Him? Like your fish.
Black.
It's OK now.
Relax.
I'd really  like a bloody mary.
I have a headache.
Relax.
Lie down.
Take this.
Swallow it all at once.
What's the address of that house?
But, the next morning...
Hello,  Lil?
It's Julie.
No, not very well.
I don't know.
I'm not coming in today.
I'd rather no, just a vision.
I'd rather rest.
Anyway, I'll be in tomorrow.
Allright!
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
What was the address of that house?
I told you yesterday.
7 bis rue du Nadir aux Pommes
That's it.
Gregoire?
Ah, Guilou!
Yes, it is Julie.
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
You sond so close. How odd.
You're in Paris?
Since when?
This morning!
I wantr to see you.
Today, yes today!
Wait!
Three o'clock.
St. Vincent Square.
Big kiss. See you in a minute.
To my Julie.
The child has become a man.
It seems people live here...
Nestor! Small world isn't it?
Guess who?
I recognise these soft hands. the scent of this skin the rhythm of this breath.
Guilou, you haven't changed a bit!
Do you remember the Monday? when I gathered 313?
311 because there were
5 purple poisoned coichicuros.
The days of blindman's bluff,
I couldn't find you.
When I got home it was dark.
I didn't get dessert.
The day before, when we plated "Hot-Cold", you were hotter with another.
Josette chsed me.
And the Rectory?
Has thr Rectory lost non of its charm?
Nor the young girl her naivety?
It's just as I'd imagined it.
Nothing's changed!
The gossamer caressed our bare feet... they were silvery and soft...
When I pressed you against the hedge to kiss you
There was no one around. red mouth smeared.. strawberries crushed in milk... sugared kisses, four o'clock... snacks...hot.
Kisses and rhubarb jam... cigarettes stolen from Uncle Ed... we made blue smoke rings.
The forget-me-not song... white sun, dark stomachs... and the wind howled and we danced. and we loved Exstasy!
Ecstasy! Perverse and mystic sodomisation.
Homosexual spleen in the attic... disguised as Alsatians!
Sodom. Gomorrah.
Biting your teeth Burning loins
Hot lava...sleep...
Sleeping, dying of kisses, sleeping, kisses...
Sleeping... Kisses...
Sleeping... Kisses...
Give me death, my beloved!
And now, dear friend go jack-off among the roses
You have become an unspeakable monster of vulgarity
I want never to see you again.
Good-bye forever. Forever good-bye
It's from the man over there
Go thank him.
Miss Julie?
Miss Julie has gone far away.
I don't think she'll ever come back
Where to?
Rue du Calvare in Montmartre.
Tonight you're going to get it!
I'm going to get it?
You'll be suprised.
OK, go ahead. Keep it up.
I'll keep my trap shut.
Violins!
If this keeps up, I'm splitting.
I'm eating.
Shut up
I'll tell you a story because
I'm better off than you. and your hang-ups aren't worth beans
I've met this girl...
I left my boyfriends.
Shut up! Listen!
I've met this woman... an American, a real American.
With butterfly sunglasses?
A terrific young woman... she's in all the papers...
I live at her house.
Shit! Listen! I'm not joking.
She has a pink swimming pool.
I'll invite you guys to swim someday
In a pink heart.
A heart shape.
You're crazy!
She wants to make me  her pygma... shit! Her pyg...ma...lion!
And we can sunbathe
Naked!
She's super rich.
She's loaded, her name's always in the papers.
She's taking care of me because she says I've got something... she's going to make me a great... lady ýf the dance.
Introduce me to her
- No. I've got first dibs.
And then me.
Know what she wants to do to me?
- Is she attractive?
You'll think so.
I've been with her 2 days.
How old is she?
We have to place her, you know.
What color hair?
- Red
A red-head!
Pale with freckles...
She gave me a massage, you know...
Well she has a masseur and he did it.
He's got slanted eyes.
Would she do me?
- She might do guys.
I think behind her there must be... a big political boss...
I don't know about politics.
But there's money.
Not to mention names, but there reminds me of...
Yeah an American, it's the same thing he's in the papers
She's like him.
A guy you never see, a billionaire...
Except you see her It's the same degree.
What's his name?
The man, Marylin's producer.
And what's your bitch do?
My bitch!
Get lost, you're crazy!
You're not coming swimming!
- Yes.
She doesn't want slobs.
I'm sure I know her.
She's not a dyke, you know.
She's just come from America?
But she's got a flat in France. a flat that's an entire house.
Where?
Somewhere. She told me not to tell, it's a secret.
Your lady's making it all up.
You're really dumb.
She's broke.
She lies to get you to bed.
Stupid ass.
I've been to her place.
I've seen her money,
She has servants...
Don't be so agressive.
I'm not. You're just jealous.
Nobody cares about your American.
When you see her you will.
I wondered if there's any truth in your story
Listen Alice, it's really Wonderland.
You can't imagine, I'm ecstatic.
Lucrece is zero next to her.
- I say that for Alice.
I'm getting used to it.
You're so disgusting.
Don't worry,
I know how to choose.
I have good taste too.
So do I, they're really something.
Where did all this happen?
Stupid idiot. 2 days ago.
2 days...it's not true.
I'm not telling you anything.
You're too dumb.
Lay off!
Shut up!
You said that already.
Don't get mad!
What time?
- Six thirty.
Time to do make-up.
Oh, my sister.
Go ahead Miss Stuck-up.
Miss, your fare please.
Hey, this way.
Did you have a good day?
I don't remember anything.
I've to get made-up.
And now, the astonishing... the amazing... the breathtaking... the bedazzling... the most mysterious... most marvellous... mos scabrous... most sulphurous... and so much more!
She's the...
Mandrakore!
It's fake.
It's phony.
It's fake, sweetie.
What were you just telling me?
You've an ideal?
Me? An ideal?
I'd be suprised if you didn't.
Well, anyway...
It's not worth talking about.
You could take the kid out some night
I can't take these days,
I'm busy with my American.
Where?
I don't know the mvoies.
Once in a while to amuse him
Eh, Paulo?
Would you like that?
Have you seen my gloves?
Look what you've done!
May I have kleenex, please?
Is your nose alright?
Yes, but this make-up makes me break out.
I'm tired of this mask, my skin's tight.
You're not the only one.
That's our job.
I'll become a clown, I'll replace... old Julien.
A sad clown.
What do you think?
I'll do something like this.
I'll attack them now.
They won't know you?"
They wouldn't anyway. Think they come for my mug? No way, my ass!
They sleep and drink.
Did you see how they were tonight?
I like the little assholes, as long as they pay.
What are you doing?
Is tomorrow's act ready?
All ready?
OK, great.
What do you think?
Yeah, it's alright, but you should add. some feathers.
She's crazy.
In the back.
Yeah, I've some.
Do you have green? Not there!
Lay off.
She really could do it.
Feathered Myrtille.
Hello, kids.
Hello, M. Dede.
Celine, I've something to tell you.
Tell me here.
I don't have secrets.
It's good news, come on.
Wait 2 minutes for me, OK?
I like you a lot.
You're talented, full of exburance and promise.
I've got you on contract.
And how!
Well, I'm negotiating it at the moment.
What do you mean?
I lose on it, but it's for you career.
An international tour,
Ankara, Istanbul...
Bagdad, Beirut...
Well, then?
You're making fun of me.
- Not at all.
In those places, a great artist, and French too...
It's worth gold, or better... not gold, oil my dear.
I like oil better, no, shit, I mean gold.
You'll see, you'll make some.
Old Dédé told me that... that he's got a tour for me... an international tour to Ankara, Beirut...
Wow, Beirut!
It can't be true,
I don't believe it.
Is he joking?
He says I'm worth oil, no, gold. I don't know...
Do you think it's a joke?
And this one, what's this?
My cousin.
An American cousin.
With a pool?
Of course. pink...and heart-shaped.
Shit, what's got into you?
Nothing! Nothing!
I remember nothing. It's no use.
The little sleep.
Look, I don't get any of this.
You've just forgotten, that's all.
You were in shock.
I don't know.
I'm not getting anywhere.
I don't remember anything.
Look, you're just going... you're going nuts, huh?
Try...force yourself.
That's what I'm doing,
I'm not getting anywhere.
Look, let's start over again, OK?
Try to remember from the moment...
I am starting over.
It doesn't help.
OK, but start from where you happened to show up  at the club.
Where'd you catch the taxi?
Alright, we'll start all over.
This is going to be very funny.
So...
I was...
You were... pushed out of the house... propelled.
Then I was... all wobbly...
I felt dizzy...
I was pretty mixed-up.
Anyway, I managed to get to the taxi... and once in the taxi...
I took... the candy that was in my mouth... and put it in my purse.
What candy?
This one.
What's wrong?
I see it.
What do you see?
It's a dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing
But I was witness to this vow,
I am the guarantor.
If you try to disregard it,
I'll stop you.
Do you think so?
What is pretty does no harm.
But if you say so...
Do not say that word.
You choose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier.
Is that all?
You pretend to ignore the vow.
Don't go in there!
Wâs it in the right or left yesterday?
I don't remember.
You could lose, but you always win.
You know it is forbidden her.
My own kingdom, my house, my garden, my flowers, my travel books, for me it was enough.
It would have been enough for the rest of my life.
But they had to take it away.
He claims it is hereditary.
Well, the scent of these plants doesn't help things.
Look what I've drawn for you.
Madlyn...
Ties of blood must be renewed.
Must I tell this ghastly story to its end?
My dear friend, what you have begun, you must complete.
Miss Angele!
Where'd I get them from?
It's odd you know... they mean something to me... their faces are familiar.
They come from far away...
- Yes, they must.
From very far. But they don't look like they've travelled...
Where do they come from,
Zanzibar, Mozambique?
When you're finished with your z'ing, and your childishness.
Look who's talking.
I don't know if my mind went blank, or it's hazy dreams.
It's a mish-mash.
It's like... four petrified images of puppets.
Yes, puppets... but it shouts... it munches candies... it faints... it tells stories... it goes from grey to blue... and it swoons!
It takes stairs every which way!
And to thicken the sauce, a little blood!
Wonderful!
Know what?
No, not yet,
I'd rather not know.
Why? It'll be great.
You don't know the best part...
While you're sitting down..
You know the lady in white?
She's my sister.
My twin sister.
We're as  alike as 2 peas in a pod.
The one whose hands are dirty?
I'm broad-shouldered, but I won't take all the blame.
Your acquaintances are pretty weird...
You should talk, sweetie, yours aren't so clean-cut either
You make do with what you have.
What you have, you have to get.
It's clear you've never eaten shit, the day you do, I'll laugh.
To survive in this life, you need... dough.
Can't it, honey.
Don't make me cry.
But, the next morning...
What's the address of your house?
7 rue des Pommes?
It's 7 bis... rue du Nadi aux Pommes.
I should have taken my saw.
Miss?
My Poupie!
It's not true...I must be dreaming.
How you grown!
After all these years.
My little partridge, my bengali how glad I am to see you!
Do you want your tea?
You know, the other morning
When mother came to take me away...
Oh, a baker's dozen.
After being coddled by you for 6 months.
She told me that you'd been kidnapped by a playboy and taken by helicopter to the Peloponese.
Your father did well to leave.
God rest his soul.
And what's become of your mother with her problems and her men?
I never liked her.
My doll uncles...I liked them.
They were so polite.
Do you ever hear from her?
She flits around.
She sends me a card now and then, the las one was from Java.
So, she's still the same.
Poupie, do you remember?
The little girl from the house over there?
After you left, well, she was very sick...
After you left, she was very weak...
One day, everyone left.
I never saw them again
They never came back.
No news of them.
She was my age.
Remember how the house scared you?
And no one came back?
Never.
The shutter have been closed since then.
Maybe someday, an heir will come, the shutters will open. and I'll have some company.
I'd like to see my old room.
It's just the same, with all your dolls.
I haven't touched it.
Oh, five to! I've to go.
Already?
But now that I've found you
I'll come for tea.
I promise I'll come get you.
It's been too long.
It's broken.
It's in pieces.
Do I swallow them all?
Absolutely not!
You have to take them in order.
There's 5 pieces.
Well, start with the biggest, and end with the teensy weensy one.
In order.
Here goes.
The kleenex will ruin it.
If you only knew the memories the dress brings back to me.
The sea?
The mountains?
Both.
The Borromean Islands?
Yes, six in the evening, the scent of the lemon trees, the Kursaal orchestra.
She was so pale, so fragile
More than I?
Out of my sight?
Who? What? Is it?...
What, out of her sight?
The dress or the girl?
It's the same ones.
They talk strange.
It's a whole tear, era, school.
Grand tragedy! smells like mothballs.
Let's continue.
Medium big.
How is your hand?
Better. But I must be careful.
Every moment is dangerous.
Careful. They are fragile.
Miss Angele. Come quickly.
They're doing the same thing as yesterday.
They'll do the same tomorrow.
The same, every day.
They do it full time?
- They'do it perpetually.
Permanent?
- Perpetual.
They're doing a perputal day.
How about that.
What's next.
Alright, I'm going to do it.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Hello Madlyn.
Did you sleep well?
Today is a big day.
You know I hate little games.
Come, be a sport, Miss.
What a heady scent
Well?
Well what?
Don't keep me waiting.
Which hand?
Was it in the right or the left hand yesterday?
I don't remember.
You could lose but  you always win
You know it is forbidden her.
Madlyn, I've told you not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
I've already told you, the harm you do her.
I do her no harm.
Don't get involved in this, Olivier.
I know better than you how to handle her.
I've taken care of her for 8 months.
Let me act alone.
I know better that you what I do.
The child is resting.
Please lower your voices.
I don't know if I should understand you.
After all... think what you like.
Today, I'm Angéle.
Yesterday it was me.
But it's still her.
I wonder what she's up to.
And him, what's he up to?
Who's he with?
With Camille?  With Sophie?
With Camille and Sophie and Angéle.
What do those ladies want from him?
That's what we may learn in the next episode.
What did you want to say?
Nothing you don't already know, deat Camille.
I'm listening...
You can choose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier.
Is that all?
You pretended to ignore the vow he made when his wife died.
What's vow?
My sister spent her time trapping people with her vows.
Don't insult the day when you speak of her.
But, if I must repeat it all to you...
Know, that Nathalie made him swear... not to remarry, to preserver the happiness of their child.
As long as Madlyn live,
I've always known
I was there. I heard her.
"Because I don't want Madlyn to suffer what I suffered at her age".
It's a dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing.
Perhaps. but I was witness to this vow,
I am the guarantor.
If you try to disregard it,
I will stop you.
I promised Nathlie
Her wish will be respected.
Let's make a wish.
Despite my watchfulness, I lost the key to the red cupboard.
What key?
Have you seen it?
There's a running battle here.
Yes, something's going on.
I think one of them is a real slut.
And you know which? The blonde.
With here fragile airs and stuck-up ways.
She's too secretive.
Thet's a professional bias, watch out for blondes and all
It's too obvious that she's guilty for her to be.
Funny thinking.
We'll decide by the judgement of Solomon
The one who ends up with it... wins.
Alright, hang on tight.
He doesn't have any.
He's had it.
There's another.
Monsieur wouldn't consider the mountains?
A dreadful thing has happened!
Do not go in there!
Do you think it could be...
Angele?
But, the next morning...
I'm sick.
Me too.
I want to sleep.
Me too, in fact I'm sleeping.
My legs are gone.
Mine too. But who's going...
You're smart.
Who's going to go today?
I'm going.
You want to go? You're dying to go.
You're there already.
It's not worth going.
We have to be serious.
Let's leave it to fate.
Got a coin?
I'll look in my shoe.
No more money.
Be careful, and give me back my change.
I'll eat it.
It's Swiss chocolate.
Heads I win, tails you lose.
Damn!
I'm struck dumb!
Watch out!
Tails, you lost...
How odd...
I'm going to give you...
A little massage?
An artifice.
What colour?
Pink.
Mauve.
Marshmallow.
Better than red, give me your shoulder.
My little tattoo.
What are you doing?
A double number.
It stings.
Double 33.
Don't cough.
What do I do with it now?
You can go there.
Take your bicycle.
Watch out for traffic.
If I never come back... kiss Harold goodbye for me.
Would you stop staring at me, you.
Put on some make-up, your nose is shiny.
The day... is divided into 4 parts, corresponding to the 4 seasons, and the 4 weeks of the month.
Morning or spring, noon or summer, period of growth.
Afternoon autumn, period of realisation.
This is Guilou.
How are you?
I've thought a good deal.
- About what?
We're through.
What?
Since the day before yesterday...
What is this...
I've decided.
Is this really Gregoire?
I've decided.
You wanted it this way.
Decided what?
Could you let me get a word in edgeways.
How did things go after the square?
You're the one who wanted it to end badly.
Badly?
I'm becoming a Trappist.
Is this a game?
You're pulling my leg.
I'm becoming a Trappist.
We will never speak again.
You're talking to me now.
Tell me what's on your mind.
If you want to break, we will
We already have broken up.
I just want to tell you that it's your fault.
What's my fault?
We can only say goodbye.
So goodbye.
A Trappist!
Oh, shit!
Go masturbate in the daisies like a Gregorian!
"To Julie, the child has become a nun..."
He's hanging on.
Power and virtues... of baby dinasours' eyes
The favorite food of the baby dinasaur. who was a discerning gourmet, was clover. for maximum efficiency. use the minimum the word clever
Replace it with clover
Of course...
Beirut?
Mother?
Oh excuse me.
I interfered...
Celine? She's out.
What?
It's important.
I see...
Of course.
You can count on me.
I'll tell her.
Alright.
What's this?
Where's the Mandrakore?
Who are you?
Don't get excited man, it makes you twitch.
The Mandrakore is out.
She gave me the scoop.
Don't worry. I'm show people.
Who are you anyways?
Haven't you heard? of the Kamakazi?
Your men are leaving!
Do your best.
Stay cool. It's in the bag.
Excuse the delay.
Artists, you know...
The Mandrakore is pure gold!
Naive, I'm so naive
Red-headed miss, fingers of bliss.
Naive, I'm so naive!
When I see you, sirs.
If I want to make you sigh,
I light up your eyes.
If I want to do more,
I just lay it on.
Bluestocking, that's what I am.
The shady miss, a touch like a kiss.
Bluestocking, that's what I am.
When I see you, gadzooks.
I have no heart, not even for a guy.
Life's played tricks on me
When I pick up a man,
I say right away, you'll be alright with me.
But when he's through the door, old loves come back once more.
And memory reappears.
Like a dream... of a past, that is mine.
And kills me!
Excuse me, but I ...
I always allow myself to be overcome by... irrepressible waves of feeling.
When I was childish, they told me I was a real star... a shooting star... and floating star, because...
I had a big rayon tutu.
They said I was suppleness itself, because I could put my legs around my neck, and now,
I want to express my temperament, my spontaneity.
I'm very lively.
And..I can do... the candy woamn, and the headstand woman, on my little finger, and the Snake Woman.
And... lots of other things...
And you, anyway, what can you do?
Yeah, show me what you can do.
You're here oggling me.
Oggling every inch of me...
Behind refrigerated glasses...
You're not worth beans!
Bunch of...pimps!
Cosmic pimps... cosmic twilight pimps!
Voyeurs and perverts!
What is all this?
Come and get me!
Come on!
I'll show you!
Want some fun, bunch of idiots...
Are you chicken?
Come on. Let's go!
Well?
Oh, shit!
Wait! Wait!
It's a misunderstanding.
It's nothing really.
Wait, I'll take the hairs off.
OK. Both at once.
Good morning, Miss Angele.
Good morning, Madlyn.
But why this violence?
These flowers are so pretty.
I thought I'd told Mlle Camille that for children, the sweetest smels are harmful odours.
These flowers are so pretty.
I thought I'd told Mlle Camille that for children, the sweetest smell are harmful odours.
Do you think?
What is pretty does no harm.
But if you say so...
Mademoiselle takes risks.
I'll leave you the roses... because of their thorns.
Good does not always do good.
Mademoiselle takes risks.
I'll leave you the roses... because of their thorns.
Good does not always do good.
Am I disturbing you?
You never disturb me.
I was thinking... that today is..
Madlyn's first birthday since her mother died.
And since I look so like my sister...
What are you saying?
Olivier, give me the key to the trunk.
I don't want to see those dresses again.
May I please have the key to the little chest.
I understand your reticence.
But, perhaps today...
Madlyn would be so happy.
Look at me. Nathalie's dresses would so become me.
How lucky that we have the same complexion.
I don't know if I should understand you.
I thought that today...
Now, finally...
I should have those dresses.
Mother left them to the one who could marry first.
Since my sister's death, they've been kept reverently.
They lie languishing in the attic, wrapoed in mothballs and rose leaves.
The same styles return every 20 years.
I could wear them as they are.
Think of Madlyn!
How happy she'd be!
Excuse me, my dear.
It's nothing.
Did you sleep well?
Today is a big day.
You know I hate little games.
Come, be a sport Miss.
What a heady scent!
It's getting deep.
I've told you not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I've already told you, the harm you do her.
I do no harm.
Don't get involved in this, Olivier.
Will she get him?
The child is resting.
Please lower your voices.
I don't know if I should understand you.
That's what you like.
See, I told you.
But I didn't believe it.
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's inadmissible and it could be dangerous
Madlyn's still asleep, should we wake her?
He does not wish her awakened.
He has spoken to you about it?
No, it is I who am troubled.
These frequent naps...
Thiss sleepiness is abnormal.
He claims it is hereditary.
The scent of these plants certainly doesn't help.
Sophie, look what
I've drawn for you.
I didn't frighten you?
Isn't my flower pretty?
Do not say that word.
If you only knew the memories this dress brings back to me.
The sea? The mountains?
Both.
The Borromean Islands?
She's not bad, you know.
I know I've already seen it.
...the Kursaal Orchestra
She was so pale, so fragile.
More than I?
Out of my sight!
Who? What? Is it?...
That! That thing!
You know quite well.
Your whims again, Sophie.
Come with me
I must speak with you.
What did you want to say?
Nothing you don't already know, dear Camille
I'm listening.
You choose the wrong day for trying to seduce Olivier
Always the same thing.
I'm fed up.
But if I must repeat it all to you.. know that Nathalie made him swear...
Stop. I'm having fun.
It's funny.
You'll tell me later.
Good night.
"Because I don't want Madlyn to suffer what I suffered at her age."
It's dreadful vow.
It's wrong to make someone swear such a thing.
What a bitch!
Despite my watchfulness,
I lost the key to the red cupboard.
What key?
Have you seen it?
So she took a bottle.
On it was written, "drink me".
She drank it, the liquid inside it, and became tiny.
Mummy!
Help me!
Take care of her.
Don't be afraid.
Why are you hiding?
That was Camille.
It wasn't your mother.
Don't be afraid.
Do you want a candy?
I have one here.
It's over.
I'll never be able to.
She hates me.
I'll never get her to love me.
I am tired, discouraged again.
It's just as it was 10 years ago. when Nathalie and I were young.
She loved me either.
But she was so clever.
It was never Nathalie's fault
It was always mine.
Why are you so shy, Camille?
Why aren't you more like your sister?
You must get out. Let's go dancing to the theatre, to the country.
Come, Camille, come!
She was the first to say those things.
But I was silent and refused everything.
Why?
Why, they wondered.
But I knew why.
I knew what was hidden behind her kindness, her compassion. yes, her compassion
She wanted to destroy me, to make me disappear...
And she...
What a shock?
I don't see anything now.
Let's put them back in.
See what's next.
Wait. I want a smoke.
Intermission? OK?
No. I'm going on.
OK, you continue, then you can tell me about it.
Wait. I'm coming too.
Coming? Hurry?
You are very gloomy.
I don't like to see you thus.
Your concern touches me, Sophie.
But I have good reason.
Camille's appertion?
Camille is not the question.
I understand.
It's what she has awakened in you.
Don't think of the past.
Think of the present, the birthday we are celebrating.
Look.
The doll I bought for Madlyn.
I'm sure she'll love it.
You are second mother to her.
You are a second mother to her.
Everthing I've done.
I've done for you, too.
Don't forget it.
And I hoped that you could perhaps... that we could....
Alas, Sophie...
Madlyn can draw us no closer.
But you would wish it?
I wanted to be sure.
Nathalie's vow...
I respect it as much as you do.
But you won't hear of it anymore.
There's not much of what I thought.
Not at all.
How is your hand?
Better
But I must be careful.
Every moment is dangerous.
Happy birthday, Madlyn!
You know, inspiration is so fragile...
Please.
You can't refuse.
Madlyn would be so happy.
Please, for us.
You are cruel.
A sonata.
Another sonata.
How deep!
No, I don't know.
I'll begin again.
My hurt hand...
You are so beautiful with all this red.
It's said you are the best catch in New England.
I must put my glass down.
It's divine.
I'm drunk!
So beautiful...all this blue.
With this blue, really?
Hold me, Olivier!
I've lived only for you.
My heart followed your steps.
Oh the naughty girl!
The rogue.
A very high tower, an enchanted prince, and a tree with daggers.
The Blue Bird!
Yes!
What blue bird?
You don't know that story?
It's very funny.
An enchanted prince. wishes to join his beloved in her prison tower.
But a wicked witch put daggers and razor blades in the tress and the bird is wounded. and bleeds...
Oh stop! All that blood!
Blood ties must be renewed.
Must I tell this ghastly story to its end?
My dear friend, what you have begun you must complete.
Excuse me, it's time for the child's nap.
Madlyn, be good.
Don't worry, my dear.
You won't be disturbed.
I haven't often the chance to tell you how satisfied I am with your services.
I am given compensation accordingly.
Not in the way I would like.
Madlyn is very lucky... very lucky...
I finished.
Me too.
Madlyn is very lucky.
I'm so disappointed.
Listen...
It's just padding.
We don't know who did it.
We don't know anything more.
What do we do?
It's full of holes..
I don't know.
It's like swiss cheese.
We don't know the end.
I hate that.
Anyway, we're not going back.
Listen. I have an idea.
At the library...
At the library?
Take this off. I can't stand it.
Bend your head forward.
Wait.
The sun is coming up.
In a return to the source... as natural as temporal...
It's the beginning.
...of the four basic elements.
Water.
Air.
You don't think it's polluted?
No, I don't think so.
Very gently!
It's the most fragile part.
You can pour it all.
Earth.
Clover.
How much?
Two stalks.
No, two big ones.
The same size.
Wait, a little one's cheating.
Fire.
The fire will shoot out from the four cardinal points... and from it's conflagration you'll ontain... the memory potion... called "herbed wine" by the ancients.
Because of the clover.
P.S. Beware of side effects.
Take in small doses.
OK, let's go.
We'll both start at the same time.
Can Harold have some?
A little drop.
One drop.
He swallowed it.
It's good.
Very good. Some more...
It's so good.
Let's have another. It's a part-time.
But I feel funny...
I feel fine.
But, really fine.
Mademoiselle takes risks.
Compared to the candies...
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's inadmissible, and could be dangerous.
Madlyn's still asleep, should we wake her?
He does not wish her awakened.
Your whims again, Sophie.
Help me!
Take care of her!
I knew what was hidden behind her kindness her generosity.
She shone all the brighter to the point of blinding them all.
She knew how to destroy me, make me disappear. stiffle me...
I had my own kingdom.
It was enough, my house, my flowers... my picture books... my travel books... but they had to take it away.
Your sister's getting married.
Your sister's getting married.
They'll come to live here, it's logical, it's family.
And they love each other...
They must have secrets, they must be left alone.
Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille?
See the places you've dreamed of?
Borneo, Shangai,
Macao, the Sunda Islands...
With gentle words they drove me out, and with so much money...
I travelled a lot.
Around the world twice, but it was as if another were doing it.
Only at night, was it I... in my dreams...
Always the same dream, the same house...
My house
Now she's dead. I'm alive. Free.
And it's my house.
The won't drive me out again.
I'll do anything.
Anything.
The child will have to give in, don't you think?
And blood ties?
They must be more important than everything else.
They must be renewed.
Mustn't they?
Don't you think?
Why don't you ever answer?
I have to recover, give me some more.
Blood ties must be renewed.
My head aches.
Everything's spinning.
Julie, I see you here... and there...
Why are you behind my back?
Where?
-There.
Where?
- There
Harold's tipsy too.
Madlyn, be a good girl.
Don't worry my dear,
You won't be disturbed.
I haven't often the chance to tell you. how satisfied I am with your services.
I am given compensation accordingly.
Not in the way I would like.
Madlyn is so lucky to enjoy your constant care
Could Monsieur make propositions that... are more precise?
I had thought of taking Madlyn to the sea.
You could come with us.
Impossible! The more sight of a... fish...makes me amnesiac.
Monsieur wouldn't consider the  mountains?
A dreadful thing has happened!
Do not go in there!
You are quite mysterious, my dear friend.
Your concern tickles me, my sweet.
But I have reasons for this mystery.
Both our lives depend on it...
Has my coming troubled you?
Let's see...
Wait, my turn.
Your arrival awoke in me another world that slumbered.
What you've done, we've done together.
We have given birth to night.
What would I do without you?
I hope... that we might still gather the stars of the 1001 nights?
What I've done
I couldn't have undertaken... but your presence, my sweet.
This monstrous child...
Will you not reproach me for it, someday?
My sweet, nothing could bring us closer.
My darling,
I wanted to hear you say it.
Our desires will crystallise together.
I'm scared.
Me too.
I'm scared, but we have no choice.
- We've got to to do something.
Let's go.
Have to save her.
If we never came back, what would we do?
Happily, we've still got... dinasour looks and clover
We must save the kid, all the costs.
I want to get her out.
We'll...get her out.
We'll get her out, but we can still be scared.
We can sleep too, even if we are scared.
I don't want to sleep.
I might dream if I sleep.
Everything's spinning.
I can't sleep.
I laugh when I'm afraid
Me, when I'm sick.
I feel sick to my stomach.
Once upon a time.
Twice upon a time.
Thrice upon a time.
Only, this time... it won't be like that not like the other times.
We'll get her.
Stop the machines.
But, the next morning...
Shit, we got here too early.
Time for a cigaratte.
Clever.
Clover.
Clover.
Clever.
First round for us.
I can't see straight.
Where?
Don't try to be clover.
Up to the staircase.
A real mortuary.
We'll run into stuffed ghosts.
What do we do?
In there.
Let's go.
OK. You change. I'm going in.
You look like a kapo from  the country.
You think you're so clover!
I'm going to brighten up your façade.
Make oranges grow on an olive tree.
Misss...Angéle...Terr,
Mys...tery...Angéle...
What do you mean?
This woman's a drag queen.
No, a defrocked nun.
Everything's spinning...my God.
Have a drink from the flask.
Give me yours.
Time's spinning too.
I'll be late for the commomile scene.
Here, take this one.
Eye of lynx and wooden head, yeah.
I've forgotten my lines!
I thought I'd already told you, that the finest scents are the best perfumes.
That's good enough.
Alright, let's go.
I don't remember.
You could lose, but you always win.
You know it is forbidden her.
I've told you not to hide under the pillow.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
The harm you do her.
I do no harm.
Don't get involved in this, I know better than you know to handle her.
I've taken care of her for 8 months.
Let me act alone. I know better than you what I do.
May I have...the key to the red cupboard.
I don't know if I should understand you.
It's taking off.
I'm not a  bit clover.
I put the key in the silence,
I mean I mixed up 2 scenes.
We're in deep shit, they'll be on to us.
They didn't notice.
And you, Miss Ter, have you some juicy secrets to tell me?
Imagine, my dear,
I glimpsed Camille in the attic, rumaggin about in her things.
Did she say hello?
I sneezed. She didn't flinch.
They're up to their neck in this.
The 2nd act is about to begin.
See if the coast is clear.
Someone's used my syringe again.
You nuts?
It's incomprehensible and totally shocking...
Madlyn is still asleep?
Perhaps we should wake her?
But he, caught between two fires...
Let her sleep.
He has spoken to you?
Has he said something to you?
It's me...I'm...
I'm getting stuck...these.. these whiffs of...
It's hermetic.
Well, the scent of these plants doesn't help things.
Look what I've drawn for you.
Let's see.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Isn't my flower pretty?
She's the mur...der...ess!
Shit!
The bitch! Tea without sugar!
I didn't know I was so emotional.
The bastards!
They didn't even offer me champagne!
It's not funny.
Well, I've won our bet.
We'll talk about it when we're through with this.
I thought I was done for.
Whether it's Sophie or Camille, makes no difference.
We'll continue as planned.
Help me!
Take care of her.
Do not hide under the pillow.
Don't be afraid.
It wasn't youre mother it was Camille.
Do you want a candy?
I have one care for you.
Open your mouth.
You'll sleep now.
Sleep.
My house, my garden, my flowers...
My travel books...
I'm going to swoon.
It would have been enough...
I'm going to faint.
Your sister's getting married...
They'll come to live here, it's logical.
They love each other.
Lily-livered. Go drink some potion.
Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille?
See the places you've dreamed of,
Shanghai, Macao, the Sunda Islands..
They gave me gentle words, and money, lots of money
I went around the world twice...
You're later. I've been waiting for 2 minutes.
I had to answer the call of nature.
I'm not made of clover.
Anyway, don't worry.
They won't get us now.
Eye of lynx, we've got it made.
It's said you are the best catch in New England.
You are so beautiful with all this red.
You're so palid with all this black.
I must put my glass down.
It's divine. I'm drunk...
- We're not in a melo anymore
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo...
Oh great clover, it's your turn.
Madlyn's hand.
Excuse me, it's time for the child's nap.
You'd lost your charm.
Not that way, follow me.
Put your leg here.
Wait.
Together now.
It doesn't hurt to fall off the moon.
But we failed again.
The dinosaurs took back their eyes.
Someone we know!
What will we play now?
No more playing, ever!
We're going out.
We'll take you boating.
It's raining.
Got a smoke?
We'll chew it, OK?
Miss, you lost your squirrel.

{772}{854}Enjoy it! :-)
{5409}{5489}Who's there?
{5559}{5629}Polecat!
{6279}{6384}"Valerie, forgive me."
{6552}{6630}Where are her earrings ?
{6631}{6654}Speak!
{6655}{6689}I lost them, constable.
{6690}{6719}- You lie, Orlik.|- No, I don't.
{6720}{6915}You can't avoid punishment,|I will torture you with water.
{6920}{6963}Orlik!
{6964}{7006}Bend down!
{7007}{7119}I will jump on your back.
{7209}{7251}Hurry up!
{7252}{7327}Scallywag.
{10895}{10971}Grandmom, have the actors arrived ?
{10972}{11038}You should be more concerned that|the missionaries are coming.
{11039}{11096}When?
{11097}{11150}Today or tomorrow.
{11151}{11277}One of them will be living with us.
{11278}{11381}You are not playing with that earring, are you ?
{11382}{11463}I'm not a child anymore, grandmom.
{11464}{11572}Just tonight, you know.
{11699}{11811}At 13 ... as your mother.
{11908}{11985}I'm warning you!
{11986}{12081}Get rid of that ear-rings.
{12082}{12154}Your mother put them away on the day|when she entered the nunnery.
{12155}{12228}Your father was a bishop.
{12229}{12303}As you know, both are now in heaven.
{12304}{12436}Is there some secret in these earrings?
{12437}{12475}Oh no.
{12476}{12579}I got them at this house's auction from some constable.
{12580}{12672}Did you know him?
{13081}{13154}Grandmom, the actors have arrived.
{13155}{13228}But it's just a weding.
{13229}{13329}Hedvika is marrying.
{13673}{13755}Poor Hedvika.
{13772}{13815}Why?
{13816}{13948}She will be a rich farmer's wife.
{14485}{14521}Grandmom!
{14522}{14617}Grandmom, monster!
{14811}{14885}This can't be him.
{14886}{14941}He'd died already.
{14942}{15072}Who are you talking about, grandmom?
{15073}{15169}Go and repeat your piano fingering.
{15170}{15255}O.K. grandmom.
{17480}{17534}"Beautiful maiden.
{17535}{17709}It was me who stole your earrings and|brought them back in your hands again.
{17710}{17835}My uncle, the constable, desires them.
{17836}{17954}He killed my dad and mom and I'm afraid for your destiny.
{17955}{18057}Today will be in church...
{18058}{18150}...today will be in church sermon for maidens.
{18151}{18332}Please leave your dress in summer-house so that|in disguise I could exchange a few words with you.
{18333}{18397}Your unhappy Orlik."
{18398}{18468}Valerie?
{18490}{18560}Valerie?
{18576}{18629}Where are you my child?
{18630}{18700}Valerie?!
{18701}{18771}Valerie?
{18819}{18943}It's time to dress for vesper.
{18944}{19114}Grandmom, may I take with me a leaf of rosemary?
{21621}{21746}Me, God's servant, missionary.
{21776}{21950}I came between you, maidens,|to give you the knowledge and God's vow.
{21951}{22065}Oh maiden, do you know what you are?
{22066}{22154}You are an alabaster handshake.
{22155}{22278}You are an uncut pomegranate.
{22303}{22471}You are the boat of a leaf and an opening rosebud.
{22472}{22694}Rough hand touching your breast would|leave an indelible fingerprint.
{22737}{22828}But I'm with you, my maiden.
{22829}{22976}In guardian angel's place I bow to you.
{23006}{23211}And I bless with this wine, your mouth, your breast, your lap.
{23286}{23347}Amen.
{23348}{23410}Amen.
{23599}{23664}Orlik?
{23673}{23738}Orlik?
{23743}{23808}Orlik?
{24715}{24780}Orlik!
{24828}{24893}Orlik?
{25332}{25434}Valerie, is that you?
{25477}{25551}The monster tortured me hard.
{25552}{25664}Valerie, I want to give you advice.
{25665}{25733}- We are on square.|- I'm sorry.
{25734}{25811}Don't look.
{25825}{25850}Yet?
{25851}{25893}Yet!
{25894}{25946}I'm here.
{25947}{26020}Firstly :
{27538}{27679}Where is the public poor-house, dear child?
{27680}{27780}There, reverend sir.
{27802}{27896}You do act from mercy?
{27897}{27964}Or don't you like me?
{27965}{28055}No reverend sir.
{28132}{28237}Dear me! I please you.
{28334}{28424}You enter first.
{28542}{28640}Go on, don't worry.
{28743}{28811}Please.
{28828}{28925}This is my kingdom.
{29545}{29615}Valerie!
{29657}{29719}Come!
{29729}{29797}Closer.
{29818}{29898}Come closer.
{29995}{30043}Look.
{30044}{30109}Oh no!
{30200}{30326}I know that I don't appeal to you anymore, my Gracian.
{30327}{30450}Only five years ago, when you were here last time...
{30451}{30528}...but now!
{30650}{30720}Go away!
{30735}{30784}I will lash myself.
{30785}{30883}- Grandmom!|- Look!
{31286}{31381}It's only a dream.
{31403}{31545}I'm asleep and everything is a dream.
{31820}{31872}Did he hurt you ?
{31873}{31931}No.
{31982}{32052}He wants you to love him.
{32053}{32125}How could I love him when I am affraid of him?
{32126}{32213}That's just it.
{32290}{32331}Orlik?
{32332}{32366}Orlik!?
{32367}{32414}I'm waiting for you, constable.
{32415}{32485}Damned broker.
{32486}{32573}Hands up, burglar, or I will shoot!
{32574}{32659}Elsa, it's me.
{32690}{32795}Don't you remember me?
{32829}{32899}Richard.
{32930}{33063}I haven't heard my name for ages.
{33157}{33262}Why did you come Richard?
{33263}{33365}I missed you so much.
{33385}{33608}I had never loved another man from that time you seduced me and left.
{33613}{33733}I'm really sorry about that.
{33779}{33865}See how old you are, Elsa!
{33866}{33913}Then you were 17.
{33914}{33989}What would I give to become younger like you.
{33990}{34113}Richard, tell me your secret.
{34125}{34263}I will give you everyting you want.
{34376}{34499}Give me back this house, Elsa!
{34500}{34589}This means to rob Valerie!?
{34590}{34730}You are capable of much worse deeds!
{34833}{34878}Yes, I will.
{34879}{35042}Well, let's write a small business agreement.
{35063}{35151}You will be young and beautiful again.
{35152}{35274}It will happen tonight, on the stingy farmer's wedding night.
{35275}{35360}You are devil!
{35395}{35450}This pearl will save you.
{35451}{35510}Orlik, where is Valerie?
{35511}{35588}- I kidnapped her.|- Where?
{35589}{35644}To the church tower.
{35645}{35820}- Au!|- Come to me, ninny! You will take me there.
{37348}{37411}Pray.
{37674}{37754}Do you hear?
{37872}{38065}For the third time bells had tolled and went quiet again.
{38109}{38211}The food is excelent.
{38255}{38477}One enjoys any meal, especially after things|I've seen when I was with the cannibals.
{38478}{38547}There we saved a young black girl.
{38548}{38700}- She was very beautiful.|- What happened to her, reverend?
{38701}{38899}We took her to our tent and|tried to convert her to our faith.
{38900}{38963}She showed a great talent.
{38964}{39043}And did she become really a nun?
{39044}{39116}Unfortunately no.
{39117}{39236}- We lost her in a certain french port.|- Martha, where is wine?
{39237}{39324}One day I will tell you what happened to her.
{39325}{39507}She fell into bad indecency and|committed a sin against 6th commandment.
{39508}{39650}- I will give you advice in that respect, dear child.|- Thank you, reverend.
{39651}{39784}Your father bishop was a gentleman.
{39785}{39953}He fainted during bride's confession and|all the beautiful women adored him.
{39954}{40022}I will tell you more sometime.
{40023}{40072}And how many children did he have?
{40073}{40191}You and a boy called Orlik.
{40217}{40281}Orlik!?
{40282}{40345}What happened?
{40346}{40434}I've got a headache. May I go and lie down?
{40435}{40474}Dinner is still not over.
{40475}{40538}Excuse me.
{40539}{40642}Will you touch the glasses with us?
{40643}{40682}I have never drunk wine.
{40683}{40793}Make an exception today.
{40886}{41004}In a memory of dead bishop.
{41169}{41234}Orlik?
{41301}{41366}Orlik?
{42301}{42376}I want to talk to you my child.
{42377}{42429}Now reverend?
{42430}{42531}There is no better time for contemplation.
{42532}{42605}How beautiful breasts you have.
{42606}{42699}Go away reverend.
{42745}{42870}What I want from you is sweet.
{42955}{43057}You are so beautiful!
{43072}{43166}- You are so gorgeous!|- Go away.
{43167}{43242}You are so fascinating!
{43243}{43456}I will resist you, you coward.|You will responsible for my death.
{43627}{43725}What have you done?
{45104}{45172}Signed.
{45368}{45478}My house is again yours.
{45514}{45651}And now we will wait till midnight.
{45664}{45762}At the wedding bed.
{46778}{46868}Come, it's time.
{46964}{47056}Pity of my hopes.
{47237}{47327}Come, it's time.
{47588}{47665}I'm so old.
{47680}{47765}I will be too.
{48587}{48697}- Do you love me?|- Yes.
{49224}{49329}Not one drop of blood.
{49335}{49382}Don't cry.
{49383}{49498}You look old when you cry.
{49949}{50019}Valerie?
{50034}{50104}Valerie?
{50178}{50243}Orlik!
{50473}{50538}Orlik.
{50569}{50639}Valerie!
{50808}{50875}Please.
{50981}{51036}- Don't look that way.|- What way?
{51037}{51114}Kneel down!
{51162}{51239}Kneel down!
{51331}{51446}- Isn't it too cold?|- No.
{51569}{51627}I'm like blindman.
{51628}{51703}There is a free guest room in our house.
{51704}{51781}You will relax there.
{51782}{51855}He knocked me down from the tower, toad.
{51856}{51954}The bell clapper saved me.
{51955}{52049}I heard the strange toll.
{52050}{52142}I prayed for you.
{52305}{52388}Plague is our best friend.
{52389}{52472}If my uncle don't get enough fresh blood.
{52473}{52537}- He will die of a terrible death.|- You are cruel
{52538}{52600}He is 100 years overdue for death.
{52601}{52681}The monster.
{52864}{52994}It's nothing, just a hanged man.
{53226}{53268}Where are we?
{53269}{53343}Still under your house.
{53344}{53386}I'm afraid.
{53387}{53451}Be brave!
{53452}{53506}Who is in these coffins?
{53507}{53695}Victims from which the polecat sucked blood.|Look here.
{53757}{53830}Grandmom!
{53844}{53914}Valerie!
{54583}{54716}Excuse me, I was't suitably dressed.
{54717}{54812}This is your room.
{54887}{54968}I thought that the room was free.
{54969}{55050}I came on the night coach.
{55051}{55106}Do you recognize me, don't you?
{55107}{55169}I'm your remote cousin.
{55170}{55231}Call me Elsa.
{55232}{55302}Valerie.
{55304}{55404}And this is...|...this is my brother.
{55405}{55470}Orlik.
{55477}{55612}I have settled in your room as you can see.
{55613}{55659}I give it up.
{55660}{55763}No, no, you will give me another one.
{55764}{55819}I will talk to grandmother about it.
{55820}{55923}Your grandmother had left, dear child.
{55924}{55979}Without farewell?
{55980}{56107}Old people have strange habits.
{56141}{56302}- I hope you will allow me to take her room.|- With pleasure.
{56303}{56400}This room is yours.
{56471}{56538}Please.
{56861}{57021}- I'd love to ride a horse.|- I'll lend you mine.
{57022}{57157}I am very tired, I will go to bed.
{57216}{57366}- Don't you recognize me, Valerie?|- No.
{57493}{57628}You are not afraid of me, are you?
{57639}{57829}I'm just joking, my dear.|We really meet for first time.
{60453}{60533}My earrings.
{61290}{61367}Your sister hasn't returned?
{61368}{61452}Where is Valerie? Do you know?
{61453}{61643}- You are sweet when you are angry.|- Where is Valerie!?
{61652}{61762}I will tell you on one condition...
{61763}{61875}...that you will love me.
{61935}{62000}Never!
{62070}{62117}Go away sir.
{62118}{62157}No.
{62158}{62249}I'm not your guest. You go!
{62250}{62352}You will regret that!
{63549}{63624}You will have glorious death.
{63625}{63723}Die as maiden! Die!
{63754}{63862}Orlik!? Orlik!? Orlik!?
{63983}{64183}Good night my dark haired girl, good night and sweet dreams.
{64221}{64374}When you wake up don't reveal the secret.
{64490}{64556}Valerie you are saved.
{64557}{64598}I heard everything.
{64599}{64659}My cousin loves you.
{64660}{64725}- Cousin?|- I know.
{64726}{64780}It's grandmom.
{64781}{64842}She stole my earrings.
{64843}{64910}But empty.
{64911}{65019}There is their mystery.
{65031}{65097}They will save you from danger of death.
{65098}{65166}Beware of polecat!
{65167}{65209}Where is he?
{65210}{65254}He's dying.
{65255}{65314}Wretch.
{65315}{65415}You were sold on his charm.
{65416}{65462}Valerie.
{65463}{65540}I love you.
{65544}{65574}You can't!
{65575}{65618}- We are brother and sister.|- But...
{65619}{65681}- We have the same father.|- ...that's not not true.
{65682}{65745}Valerie, come back.
{65746}{65871}Valerie, my father is polecat!
{66919}{67044}Yea and nay, yea and nay, yea!
{68085}{68153}I'm dying.
{68154}{68221}I'm dying.
{68222}{68293}Now you can see what old age means.
{68294}{68359}Valerie? Valerie?
{68360}{68437}You are wasting your time.
{68438}{68504}Valerie's dying.
{68505}{68630}I sacrificed her for my youth.
{68685}{68791}You are as lost as I'm.
{68792}{68861}You will fall into the same spasms.
{68862}{68973}Only your granddaughter could save us both.
{68974}{69066}She has my blood.
{69069}{69089}How is that?
{69090}{69169}Her father was not the bishop?
{69170}{69244}I was bishop!
{69245}{69304}I'm her father.
{69305}{69350}You lie.
{69351}{69398}Drink!
{69399}{69449}- Drink!|- No!
{69450}{69638}- First tell me how to extend my youth.|- Save Valerie!
{69642}{69761}Our salvation is in her blood.
{69762}{69810}Valerie.
{69811}{69899}Damned Valerie.
{70037}{70107}It's me.
{70122}{70172}Father!
{70173}{70246}My child!
{70311}{70386}Take this.
{70516}{70596}No i detest.
{70604}{70713}I'm a human again and I have to die.
{70714}{70809}No, you won't die.
{71550}{71610}You saved me.
{71611}{71671}Dad.
{71798}{71949}- Let me go! I please you.|- I'm again the monster.
{71950}{72025}Let me go!
{72029}{72095}Leave me alone!
{72096}{72174}No! No! No!
{73688}{73749}Gracian!
{73750}{73827}My Gracian!
{73954}{74024}Gracian!
{74064}{74181}Your lover sleeps like a log.
{74182}{74252}Gracian.
{74339}{74422}Poor Gracian.
{74438}{74552}I have a certain plan, Elsa.
{74553}{74655}I need Orlik's heart.
{74663}{74708}Do you want to kill Orlik?
{74709}{74797}His heart will reanimate my daughter|and give her eternal youth.
{74798}{74891}Richard, transplant Orlik's heart into my chest.
{74892}{74999}Are you going to betray Valerie?
{75000}{75110}Richard, you will do it.
{75198}{75298}With bleeding heart.
{75424}{75463}Orlik?
{75464}{75495}Orlik?
{75496}{75596}Why did i leave you.
{76061}{76093}Help!
{76094}{76123}Help!
{76124}{76202}Why do you show your face to me, Valerie?
{76203}{76317}Don't worry, I'm not dead and you are neither.
{76318}{76460}Come on, I will show you the way out.
{76533}{76609}Parsonage is on the opposite side, reverend.
{76610}{76687}Reprobate, you tempted me to commint a sin.
{76688}{76771}You will see!
{76944}{77016}"Valerie.
{77017}{77051}Valerie.
{77052}{77110}I'm saying good bye.
{77111}{77229}You have left me and the monster had disgraced your mouth.
{77230}{77313}We could have been so happy together but it's too late now.
{77314}{77360}Believe Valerie.
{77361}{77464}Polecat is not your and mine Father.
{77465}{77547}You extened his life.
{77548}{77658}I wanted be your guardian, friend and husband but it's too late.
{77659}{77752}Farewell Valerie, your Orlik.
{77753}{77789}Valerie?
{77790}{77833}Valerie, what happend to you?
{77834}{77864}Come.
{77865}{77935}Hedvika.
{78225}{78283}Hedvika?
{78284}{78405}Hedvika, what happend to you? Hedvika?
{78406}{78478}I'm fading from wedding.
{78479}{78528}- Eat strong soups.|- No.
{78529}{78606}No. No. No.
{78611}{78744}I'm under the spell of a vampire.
{79023}{79093}Valerie?
{79097}{79187}See my shoulder.
{79260}{79299}Does it hurt?
{79300}{79348}Oh no. No.
{79349}{79397}Do you see anything on my lips?
{79398}{79494}- No, why?|- Are not they stained?
{79495}{79613}You ate fruits, didn't you?
{79723}{79840}I'm not afraid of anything when you are with me.
{79841}{79894}I'm so happy.
{79895}{80023}I have never had a real friend.
{80630}{80682}Valerie?
{80683}{80756}Valerie, I'm saved!
{80757}{80806}- Hedvika.|- See!
{80807}{80902}The stain is gone.
{80988}{81162}- Your kisses gave me back my health.|- You are so beautiful.
{81163}{81246}There lives a witch among you!
{81247}{81324}She tortured me with sinful words.
{81325}{81424}She rubbed her slick hips against me.
{81425}{81515}Whe she found that I could resist her seducements.
{81516}{81614}She threw a noose round my neck.
{81615}{81770}I thank God that I'd escaped with my life.
{81771}{81894}But the witch is hidden among you.
{81895}{81950}In name of God give her in!
{81951}{82073}- She deserves to be burned to death.|- That's lie! Don't believe him.
{82074}{82127}It's her! The witch!
{82128}{82195}Don't believe him! He is lying, I swear.
{82196}{82265}Apage satanas!
{82266}{82396}Catch her! On the pyre with her!
{82838}{82949}Plead guilty! You are a witch!
{82950}{82997}Lier, firer.
{82998}{83068}Expiate.
{83158}{83258}Moustached comedian.
{84833}{84866}Orlik.
{84867}{84979}Why have you forsaken me?
{87258}{87356}Come here, bitches!
{87435}{87550}Have you ever been beaten?
{87843}{87908}Beast!

{89587}{89664}Polecat!!!!
{91251}{91381}I wish all the spells went away.
{93296}{93369}Grandmom.
{93449}{93487}When did you come back?
{93488}{93633}Where from, my child, I was in church.
{93773}{93900}Have the missionaries gone yet?
{93950}{94028}Which missionaries?
{94029}{94144}What happend to you child?
{94207}{94302}Nothing, grandmom.
{94726}{94767}Grandmom?
{94768}{94878}There is an unknown boy.
{94893}{95058}It's only a actor,|who wander around the town.
{95595}{95654}"My dear.
{95655}{95733}Don't go to the theater.
{95734}{95792}Let
{95798}{95873}right away
{95888}{95939}harness the horses
{95940}{96050}and go to the blue lake.
{96208}{96325}Don't shoot for god's sake!
{96611}{96650}Miss!
{96651}{96774}Miss, your grandmom is dying!
{96814}{96861}Grandmom!
{96862}{96989}Dear grandmom, how do you feel?
{97042}{97114}Grandmom.
{97277}{97308}Grandmom.
{97309}{97376}Mirror.
{97751}{97885}Coach without a driver went out from court.
{97886}{97974}This is a good sign.
{97975}{98135}I never had a courage to tell you the truth.
{98238}{98386}Your mother loved certain young hunter.
{98447}{98521}And gave birth to his two children.
{98522}{98605}Boy and girl.
{98661}{98783}But, Richard, my lover told me that those children were his.
{98784}{98843}And I, from jealousy,
{98844}{98930}drove out your mother from the house.
{98931}{98994}I kept the girl.
{98995}{99044}That's you.
{99045}{99136}Orlik was kidnapped by Richard|and ended up in an unknown place.
{99137}{99208}I drove out your mother with these words.
{99209}{99263}"I will only take you in
{99264}{99334}when the horses bring you back."
{99335}{99448}My mother is still alive?
{99540}{99613}Grandmom!
{100305}{100349}Mom!
{100350}{100423}My child!
{100643}{100765}This is your father, my dear.
{100817}{100892}I know your face from somewhere, father.
{100893}{101040}You probably remember it from babyhood.
{101315}{101452}Is this all real, it's not a dream?
{101522}{101672}I wish your grandmother had forgiven me.

What did you do?
- [ Mary Whimpering ]
- Oh, I'm sorry.
[ Whimpering, Gagging ]
Well, I-I work at Lapelle's factory.
I'm...
I'm a printer.
Hen-Henry's very clever at printing.
Yes, he sounds very clever.
[ Door Hinge Squeaking ]
I thought I heard a stranger.
We've got chicken tonight.
Strangest damn things. They're man-made.
Little damn things... smaller than my fist.
They're new!
I'm Bill.
Hello. I'm Henry.
Henry's at Lapelle's factory.
Oh, printing's your business, huh?
Plumbing's mine. Thirty years.
I've seen this neighborhood change from pastures... to the hellhole it is now.
- [ Train Rumbling, Approaching ]
- I put every damn pipe in this neighborhood.
- Dad!
- Bill!
- [ Rumbling Grows Louder ]

The-The girls have heard this before... but 14 years ago...
I had an operation on my arm here.
Doctors said I wouldn't be able to use it.
"Well, what the hell do they know?" I said.
And I rubbed it for a half hour every day... and I got so as I could move it a little.
And then I got so as
I could turn a faucet.
And pretty soon, I had my arm back again.
Now I can't feel a damn thing in it.
All numb.
I-I... I-I'm afraid to cut it, you know?
Mary usually does the carving, but... maybe tonight you'll do it, Henry.
All right with you?
Of course.
I'd be happy to.
Do I just, uh... just cut them up like regular chickens?
Sure, just cut 'em up like regular chickens.

And now I want you to tell me.
Oh, I-I'm very...
I love Mary.
Henry, I asked you if you and Mary had sexual intercourse.
Well, I don't... I don't think that's any of your business.
Henry!
I'm sorry.
You're in very bad trouble if you won't cooperate.
[ Breathing Heavily ]
Well, uh, I...
Mary!
[ Crying ]
Mother!
Answer me!
I'm too nervous.
There's a baby. It's at the hospital.
Mom!
And you're the father.
But that's impossible. It's only been...
Mother, they're still not sure it is a baby.
It's premature, but there's a baby.
After the two of you are married, which should be very soon... you can pick the baby up.

- Hello.
- Hello.
Do you realize this Nigerian coffee is being packed straight back to Nigeria?
Frightening, isn't it?
- Been here long?
- Mr. Travis?
- Long enough.
- Mr. Travis!
- Oh, see you.
- Yeah.
This Hessler is our latest machine.
It gives a four-sided seal and runs 72 packs a minute.
Any fault in the plastic packing can cause a break.
The coffee is returned to our patent coffee processor.
Now, why is that? Mr. Biles?
- I've been off sick, sir.
- Eliminates waste, sir.
Absolutely correct.
Always remember, gentlemen, that you are a failure in catering...
...if you don't know what to do with your leftovers.
Right, I'll take them off your hands now, Mr. Stone.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Now, gentlemen...
...you have learned the number one truth.
That a cup of Imperial Coffee is the only proper way to finish a meal.
Be it in a palace or a prison.
But between the making and the drinking must stand the salesman.
This is where you come in.
You will be our representatives in the frontline.
Each one of you is going to have to prove himself on the battlefield of sales.
It's a hard road you'll have to travel.
There will be whole days when you won't sell a bean...
...but you will go out the very next day and hit the jackpot.
Mr. Duff, may I ask a question?
- Certainly, Mr. Travers.
- Travis.
Beg your pardon.
How much does a top salesman get paid?
Your basic salary will be low, of course,
11.50 pounds per week, before tax.
But for a good man, with commission, the sky is the limit.
Our star salesman at the moment...
...a wonderful man called Jim Oswald...
...takes home anything from 75 pounds...
...to 150 pounds a week.
Now, I have never lied to you...
...never given you false hopes...
...but I believe in you.
With a coffee pack in one hand and your sales list in the other...
...I want you to be one long line...
...of shining success.
From John O'Groat's to Land's End.
Now, selling is psychology.
A good salesman must know something about psychology.
And in that particular field,
I can think of no better authority...
...than our chief of public relations,
Mrs. Gloria Rowe.
Mr. Spalding, please.
Come here, Mr. Spalding.
Smile.
Smile, Mr. Spalding.
Imperial product is good.
But people don't buy things just because they're good.
They have to believe.
And you have to inspire that belief.
You have to believe.
Remember the words of William Blake.
"A sincere belief that anything is so, will make it so."
Sincerity. Honesty.
Mr. MacIntyre, Mr. Travis,
Mr. Greasy.
- Thank you, Mr. Spalding.
- Thank you.
Hello, Mr. MacIntyre.
Smile.
Give with all your heart.
Don't think of yourself.
Relax those cheek muscles.
Smile, Mr. MacIntyre.
Mr. Travis.
Morning, Mrs. Rowe.
Now, that is sincerity.
That is a completely sincere smile.
If I was a buyer and these were two travellers...
...I'd definitely buy from the guy I like.
I'd definitely buy from the sincere personality.
I'm definitely going to buy from you,
Mr. Travis.
Lecture hall here. Duff speaking.
Now, Mr. Travis,
I want you to smile at Mr. Greasy.
Mr. Greasy, smile back and give Mr. Travis a firm handshake.
Certainly. Right away, sir.
Mr. Greasy, don't think I'm being personal...
...but we're when dealing with food products, hygiene must be our motto.
Make sure you've got clean fingernails.
- Mrs. Rowe?
- Yes.
The chairman wants to see us immediately.
Take a break, gentlemen.
I'll see you on the shop floor in 20 minutes.
Gentlemen, I have very bad news.
Oswald has left the Northeast.
Left?
Vanished. Disappeared.
No notice. Nothing.
Just one ruddy great hole on the map.
And that's not all.
Oswald is suspected of trafficking in stolen goods under imperial's name.
- My God.
- Oh, God.
Well, I need an immediate replacement.
Mr. Duff, how are your trainees?
They're very good, sir.
But they need another two weeks.
No, no, I can't wait.
Mrs. Rowe.
Now, what's your instinct say?
Who's my man?
Can you sniff him?
Travis.
That's your man.
Travis, we're in a jam.
You heard about Oswald?
It's a case of all hands to the pumps.
I understand, sir.
Now, Mrs. Rowe has spoken highly of you...
...and I have never known her wrong...
...so I'm going to play her hunch.
I'm giving you the Northeast.
Now, that's as far north as the border...
...as far west as Lancashire...
...and as far south as the Humber.
It's a big challenge.
Do you think you're up to it?
I know I am, sir.
Normally, an opportunity like this wouldn't come your way for 10 or 20 years.
Men far more experienced than you have had their shot at it...
...and been broken by it.
But you've got guts...
...and you've got ambition...
...and that gives you a head start.
Good luck.
Now, there's your card.
Never travel without it.
Your map...
...your compass...
...and your car keys.
Now go out there and fight.
I will, sir. Every inch of the way.
You can rely on me.
Good man.
He's all yours now, Mrs. Rowe.
Oh, and Travis...
Thank you very much, sir.
Come here, Mr. Travis.
I am going to give you a simple test.
Be very careful how you answer.
I want you to taste these cups of coffee...
...and tell me what they do for you.
Sturdy...
...plebian...
...plenty of body.
A vigorous robusta?
Spicy.
Now this.
The future is in your hands, Mr. Travis.
Take it.
Now.

Commenting on the...
and much of Central Southern England,
though it probably won't reach...
... the East Midlands till after midnight.
Now for Eastern England, Central Northern
England and Northeast England.
A foggy start in most places
and a mostly dull misty day...
... with rain and drizzle at times.
The outlook for tomorrow and Thursday,
dry but cold at night...
... with frost in places
and fairly widespread fog.
And that's the end
of the weather forecast.
And finally,
overseas posting for Christmas...
... tomorrow parcels should be posted to
Argentina, Iraq via Lebanon and Trinidad...
... letters should go to Malaya
at Anzac SPO 5.
Tell my mother I'm all right.
It's her birthday.
- You the only witness?
- Yes, I saw it. I can give you a statement.
Don't bother.
No need to detain the gentleman.
Tell my mother.
~ Hold me close wherever we go ~
He's gone.
Now scarper.
But what about him?
Done for. Perforated kidneys.
It was his fault.
He was driving too fast.
Oh, we can see what happened.
We'll be witnesses.
Save you the trouble.
Oh, it's no trouble.
I can give you a statement.
As far as we're concerned, it's a private accident.
No one else involved.
Unless you give a statement.
Then our chief constable might find you're involved.
He might bring charges against you.
Using us as witnesses.
Our word against yours.
So on your way, chummy.
Unless you want booking for manslaughter.
There you are.
Fair dos.
Fair dos.
A report from our Belfast newsroom.
Two gunmen fired seven shots,
aimed it seems at the sentries on duty...
... in the grounds of the general's house
which is heavily guarded by soldiers...
... and security staff with dogs.
Soldiers fired back
and later found traces of blood...
... which lead them to believe
they hit one of the gunmen.
The Egyptian War Minister,
General Sadek, has resigned.
The move was seen as a reflection
of the dissension in Egypt...
... over the country's relationship
with the Soviet Union.
And tonight it's your line
on the subject of mental health.
It's estimated that one in six women,
and one in nine men...
... will enter a hospital at least once
in their lives because of mental illness.
What are the causes of the steady increase
in mental illness?
Can they be avoided?
Are we spending
enough care and money...
... on the mentally sick
and the mentally handicapped?
Are they better treated in hospital
or in their own homes and communities?
Mr. Travis?
Hello. Good evening.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
I was getting quite worried about you.
It can be a nasty drive over those moors.
Still, here you are safe and sound.
Bill!
Would you sign the book, please?
You've missed supper...
...but I'll do you something special.
Bill, would you show Mr. Travis to his room?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Mr. Travis...
...I'm afraid Mr. Oswald left quite a lot behind.
I put it in one of the drawers.
I didn't like to throw it out.
That's all right. I'll manage, thank you.
So you're the new rabbit?
You're the replacement, are you?
- Who are you?
- Oh, I live here.
Don't let me hold you up.
Would you like a cigarette?
Oh, sorry.
You look a bit young.
Well, you need a young man for a job like this.
Possibly.
Did you ever meet your predecessor?
- Oswald?
- Oswald.
No, I've only been with the firm five weeks.
That stuff's no good. I told him.
Why did he scarper?
Luck.
Opportunity.
He took off.
No stamina.
That's what you've gotta have in a job like this. Stamina.
You've got to have it. Providing, of course, you've got the technical know-how.
Nothing else you need?
Well, you've got to have ambition.
Mr. Travis?
Yes, Mrs. Ball.
I've got your supper ready.
It's in the parlour.
Thank you, Mrs. Ball. I'll be right down.
Watch out for her treacle tart.
There's many a fly got stuck in that.

Good morning. Mrs. Williams?
- Who?
- Mrs. Williams. Catering manageress.
She doesn't come in anymore.
It's urgent.
There's nothing urgent around here.
They're closing us down.
- Closing you down?
- Paying us off.
Why?
- Five thousand men?
- That's right.
Redundant.
Good evening.
I'd like to see the catering manager,
Mr. Faulkner.
- And it's Mr...?
- Travis.
Imperial Coffee.
I'll see if he's still on duty.
You can sit down.
It's Imperial Coffee, Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Travis.
- Lovely evening, Mr. Faulkner.
- Charlie Johnson.
Sit down.
Panatela?
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Is Mr. Faulkner off?
No, no, but I'm the manager here.
I like to keep my contacts personal.
So do I.
- You'll be replacing your previous colleague?
- Correct.
Sad business that.
Still, I take it the arrangements will be as were?
Yes, Mr. Johnson. Yes.
It's Mayor Johnson, to be precise.
I've still got three months in office.
Good. Well, I'll give you all the help I can.
Not only here, but in Leeds, Doncaster,
Wakefield and other cities...
...of major importance surrounding.
You can confirm with Faulkner that we'll be continuing our standing bulk order.
In fact, you'll find him around the back now.
You've just come at the right time.
We're having a bit of a party.
Do you like you know what?
- What, Mayor Johnson?
- A party.
Oh, yes.
- Absolutely delighted.
- Right.
Come on then.
- Good evening, mayor.
- Good evening.
Have they fixed that TV set in the Rockingham suite yet?
- They're doing it now.
- Good.
Telly Rent.
Marvellous firm.
I'm on the board, you know?
If ever you want a telly.
Very fortunate your coming on a Tuesday.
We always have a bit of a gathering on Tuesdays.
You'll make some useful contacts.
Always best to meet people when they're relaxed.
Plenty of variety. Promise you that.
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.
This is Mr. Travis, Linda.
That's Linda.
- Happy to greet you.
- Pleased to meet you too.
- Get my coat, love.
- Well, thank you.
You'll enjoy yourself here,
I can tell you.
Hey, sit down, will you?
Sit down.
- Hello, Mr. Johnson.
- Hello, Harry.
- Sit down.
- Ta. New member?
Yes. This is Mr. Travis of Imperial Coffee.
Glad you could make it tonight.
Harry Wilson, tax office.
- Great pleasure to meet you.
- Chief inspector.
Any little business problems you run up against, let me know.
- Attenborough. I edit the local rag.
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is Jackie.
- Happy to greet you.
- Pleasure.
- Wakedale Echo.
Invaluable to a man in your line.
Comes out every Thursday.
Have you met Maureen?
Maureen, Maureen.
- Say hello to Mr. Travis.
- How do you do?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Travis.
Barlow, county constabulary.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Superintendent.
At your service. And this is Mavis.
Now, you be nice to Mr. Travis, Mavis.
- But not too nice.
- Happy to greet you.
- Great pleasure.
- Come here. Come here.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the part of the show you've all been waiting for.
We have a first-class selection for you.
All your favourites...
...and one or two novelties.
And as usual, we will be starting with our request spot.
So if you'd like to signify your preference in the usual manner...
Isle of Capri.
- Whiplash.
- Aye, Whiplash.
- Whiplash. Whiplash.
- Roman Candles.
Roman Candles!
- Roman Candles. Another one?
- Chocolate Sandwich.
- Chocolate Sandwich.
- Yes, Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
All right. All right.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
You have it. You have it.
Ladies and gentlemen, by overwhelming demand...
...we start with everybody's favourite,
Chocolate Sandwich.
Come on, June, Violet, Eddie.
Come on, loves. Give them a big hand.
Travis. Imperial Coffee.
Becky. Mind if I borrow your knee?
Thank you.
Michael.
Mrs. Ball?
Mary.
Mr. Travis.
Wanted on the phone. Urgent.
Hello? Hello?
Gloria.
What? What's that?
Scotland as well?
I haven't any warm clothing.
Yes, but I'm doing well here.
Building up some fabulous contacts.
I don't wanna throw it away.
Yes, I see it's a challenge.
Tomorrow? But where?
Well, that's 200 miles away.
By 10 a.m.?
Who do I ask for?
Yeah. Who?
Who?
Hello?
Hello, Gloria? Hello?
Mr. Travis.
Did you hear that?
Do you think I ought to go?
I've got something for you.
Come on, try it on.
Arms up.
A perfect fit.
It's good.
It really is good.
You'll find it surprisingly warm.
I'll be back. I promise I will.
Try not to die like a dog.
The blessing.
Lord, on the way to goodness...
... when we stumble, hold us.
When we fall, lift us up.
When are hard-pressed by evil,
deliver us.
Soyuz 11 's braking system for re-entry into
the Earth's atmosphere was switched off.
A soft-landing engine
fired according to plan...
... and a smooth landing was made
in the arranged area.
Presumably somewhere in Kazakhstan.
A helicopter-born recovery crew...
... which landed simultaneously
with Soyuz 11...
... opened the hatch and found
the three cosmonauts dead.
Now, zazen. What does that mean?
Zazen is a way of sitting
cross-legged and with an erect back...
... practicing the art of Zen.
And Zen means?
To understand life, to be with life,
to get a feeling of life...
... so that in effect
all your days are good days...
... and every day should be looked upon
as living in the moment...
... rather than in the past or future.
And this is really what Zen is all about.
Living now.
Now, tell me how we come by
this illumination...
... this awareness that is at the heart
of the practice called zazen.
Is it very hard practice.
Nothing is acquired in a day.
And yet I understand that
this illumination does come suddenly.
It comes suddenly.
It comes in many ways.
One could be arranging
a vase of flowers...
I'm asking you not to give any trouble.
I want you on the ground before I count three.
One, two...
- I'm only trying to find out where I am.
- Don't kick or butt with your head...
...and you won't get hurt.
Okay, chaps, get him in.
Most places will have a cloudy day
and there will be rain and drizzle at times.
Now, Mr. Travis...
...you realize where you are?
You know where you are,
Mr. Travis?
Yes.
Your pass?
- What's in these packets?
- Coffee samples.
Hey, that happens to be company property.
I have to account for every single bean.
Otherwise, I'm in trouble.
You are in trouble.
Who are you working for?
- Gloria Rowe.
- Who else?
What do you mean, who else?
Who are you working for?
The Imperial Coffee Company.
Who do you know in this establishment?
I don't know anybody.
But who were you expecting to contact?
The catering manager, Mr. Woolley.
Has three children. Plays billiards.
Sign this, please.
Where the crosses are.
- What is it?
- Your confession.
I don't know what I've done.
I haven't done anything.
You'll find it easier if you sign.
I haven't done anything.
Bassett.
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please. Two sugars.
Coffee, black.
Thank you.
- Tea, Bassett?
- No, thank you, sir.
- Chocolate biscuit?
- Please.
That'll be three P for the biscuit.
- Would the young man like a cup of tea?
- Later.
There's no need to go through all this, you know?
You've only got to sign the paper.
But I'm innocent.
I haven't done anything.
There are three things you can be sure of:
The pain is not going to stop...
...you will remain conscious...
...and in the end, you will sign.
Bassett.
Now...
...let's start at the beginning.
When did you join the party?
Last year.
How much are they paying you?
- Three hundred a month.
- Three hundred what?
Pounds.
Rubles.
Was your headmaster correct to expel you from school?
Yes.
Do you believe children are the hope of the future?
Yes.
Do you believe in the fellowship of man?
- Yes.
- Think carefully.
No.
Do you rate loyalty above obedience?
Always leave everything in a mess.
I keep telling them.
recently began a project
to clear the local beach...
... a piece of woodland.
The whole school, with the help
of the Cleansing Department...
... of the local authority,
cleared five wagon-loads of rubbish.
Others planted 40 trees
with help of the Parks Department.
This is to be a manual affair.
This spring, we're building...

Let us pray.
Almighty and most merciful Father.
Almighty and most merciful Father.
We, thine unworthy servants.
We, thine unworthy servants.
Do give thee most humble and hearty thanks.
Do give thee most humble and hearty thanks.
For all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men.
For all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men.
We bless thee for our creation.
We bless thee for our creation.
No.
Not that.
That's God's food. That's for God.
You're only a boy.
Keep on there.
Go straight across the fields and through the woods.
You'll find the motorway.
Go south.
Kit. May.
The children will show you the way.
Remember, go south.
There's nothing in the north for a boy like you. Good luck.
Come on.
- Where are you making for?
- London.
In a hurry?
- Why?
- Like to pick up some spare cash?
- What for?
- Nothing much.
Scientific research. Medical.
You know the kind of thing?
We need volunteers.
- How much?
- Hundred quid.
Hundred and fifty and you're on.
I'm not authorized to vary the terms, sir...
...but if you'd like to come up to the centre, you can talk it over with the chief.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Welcome to the Millar Clinic.
Will you take a chair, please?
- Will you take a chair, please?
- Oh, thank you.
Your full name, please, sir.
Michael Arnold Travis.
- And yours, madam?
- Elizabeth Valerie Stewart.
E. V. Stewart.
- M. A. Travis.
- How much are they paying you?
Hundred and fifty pounds.
I'm getting 75 and all the food I can eat.
Professor Millar will be with you in a minute.
You must have inhaled at least
3 milligrams of Novocain.
Sir.
So that's a distinct improvement.
- Doctor Bee?
- Sir? Yes, professor?
I'll be coming into your department at 11.
I'll want Mrs. Unwin under the pathescope.
We may have to remodel her transplant.
- Certainly, professor.
- How long is it now?
- Three hundred and fifty seven days.
- Frenkel in Boston...
...kept one surviving for 14 months.
I'd like to beat him.
You will, sir.
- Professor Millar...
- one moment, Houston...
The new intake is ready, professor.
Splendid.
Oh, Professor Millar, can I borrow a heart from the organ bank for three days?
I'll have to come back to you on that one, Houston.
We may need everything we've got this week.
- Delighted to have you here.
- Very well.
- I'm Professor Millar.
- How do you do, sir.
Do sit down.
Excuse me.
Interesting.
Good.
I'm delighted to have you here.
I'll see you both later.
Sister Hallett,
Room 9 for Mr. Travis...
...and 36 for Mrs. Stewart.
I'll want a complete analysis on Travis by this afternoon.
Yes, professor.
Hughes, Keating, please.
Waterworks, okay?
Yes, fine, thank you.
No inherent madness in the family?
No, none whatsoever.
Where's she taking my suit?
Don't worry, you'll find it in your wardrobe.
- Just flex your wrist.
- Ever seen insects...
...crawling up the walls? No fits?
No, never.
- Ready when you are, Stanley.
- No typhoid, cholera, epilepsy?
Usual jabs at childhood?
All right. Here we go.
Hello. E.X. At 82 percent.
- Are you sure?
- Well, have a look.
Frontal circuit 7.4, rear lobes neutral.
Step it up a bit.
J. M. Will be happy about this.
Michael, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this...
...but you happen to belong to a very rare group of encephaloids.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Essentially, it means...
...that you are in a position to be particularly helpful to us in our research.
What kind of research?
What do you think is the most successful animal that's ever lived on this earth.
The ant?
The dinosaur.
Do you realize that the dinosaurs dominated this globe for 140 millions years...
...before they became extinct?
Man has been on this planet for only a fraction over 40,000 years...
...and yet already he faces extinction.
In fact, the species will be lucky to survive beyond the year 2010.
Mankind has only one hope.
Science.
Technology is the survival kit of the human race.
Even the politicians realize this.
What they don't, or won't, realize, is that the technical solutions...
...are already within our power.
The entire population of India could be rehoused on the moon within 10 years.
It's only a matter of learning to live in a new way.
Absolutely still.
We have almost conquered the concept of disease.
With present transplant techniques...
...there is no reason why everyone shouldn't live to be 250 or 300 years old...
...instead of our present miserable 70 or 80 years.
We're on the verge of a series of discoveries that will transform...
...our conception of human life.
What's all this got to do with me?
Michael, at this very moment...
...in laboratories throughout the world, life is being created.
It's only a matter of years, perhaps even months...
...before we can produce a whole generation of new and far more fully adapted creatures.
I have a mongrel in the experimental wing here who can't tie his own shoelaces.
By the end of the summer, he'll be a contract bridge champion.
Falling in love, making love.
We'll no longer need to depend on this inefficient way of distributing random genes.
Computers programmed to select the correctly matched...
...DNA molecules will be able to produce an entirely satisfactory human breed.
This is the future, Michael.
This is the work for which I need your help.
Yes, but what's gonna happen to me?
Will I come out the same as I went in?
Not the same...
...better.
Now, I would just like you to sign this release form.
"I hereby consent to lease the Millar Research Clinic...
...all physical experimental rights in my body...
...for one week for the sum of 100 pounds."
I'd like to help, Professor Millar...
...but 150 pounds is definitely my minimum price.
Definitely.
A figure like that is just beyond us.
One hundred and fifty pounds, and I'm not going to argue about it.
A hundred and thirty.
A hundred and forty five.
A hundred and thirty five.
A hundred and forty.
Done. Sign by the cross.
Sister Hallett?
Yes, professor?
Give Mr. Travis a sedative.
Certainly.
Sleep well, Michael.
- All quiet?
- Yes, professor.
- No fluctuations?
- Quite stable.
I'll take him first.
It'll be a long job.
Four or five hours.
Do you think it'll take, professor?
There's an even chance.
- He's in reasonably good condition.
- Oh, yes.
- Is he sterilized yet?
- Not yet, professor.
- You better send for Doctor Bee.
- Yes, professor.
We require two injections during the night.
One at 12 and one at 4.
Is that understood?
It's all right.
How much are they paying you?
How much are they paying you?
Hello, is there anybody there?
For chrissake!
You could have killed me!
- Why don't you look where you're going?
- Are you all right?
Hey, cut the conference!
Look at my bloody suit!
Are you suing us or are we suing you?
- You going to London?
- Yeah, we were.
Can you give us a lift? Okay?
Yeah, come on, get in.
Sit in the back there and keep your mouth shut.
- Mind the board.
- It's the Golden Wonder.
Come on, Streaky. Aggravate the gravel.
If you don't take that castle soon, the National Trust will.
You're shivering.
I'm wet.
Take off that jacket.
And that.
Alan, pass us the rug.
And the bottle.
Take off your trousers.
Come on, strip off.
What? Here?
Get them off. This is Patricia.
She's very intelligent.
She's making a study of us.
Thank you.
What are you? What do you do?
They're musicians.
We just trying to make some bread, that's all, mate.
Are you rich?
No, but my manager is.
Careful of those. That's gold thread.
Nylon.
Checkmate, Dave.
Never mind, at least you got it wrong.
Come over here.
Waifs and strays, she never could resist.
- How long?
- About an hour. Maybe less.
~ On and on ~
~ And on and on we go ~
~ Round the world in circles turning ~
~ Earning what we can ~
~ While others dance away ~
~ The chance to light your day ~
~ Oh, and on and on ~
~ And on and on we go ~
~ And it's round the world in circles turning ~
~ Earning what we can ~
~ While others dance away ~
~ The chance to light your day ~
- Patricia?
- She's upstairs.
Upstairs.
~ Boy, and if you have a friend
On whom you think you can rely ~
~ You are a lucky man ~
~ If you've found the reason
To live on and not to die ~
~ You are a lucky man ~
~ You know the preachers, and the poets ~
~ And the scholars don't know it
And the temples ~
~ And the statues
And the steeples don't show it ~
~ And if you've got the secret
Just try not to blow it ~
~ Stay a lucky man ~
~ Yes, yes ~
~ Now, on and on ~
~ And on and on we go ~
Morning.
- How do you feel?
- Hungry.
Could you hold this for me?
What is it?
Om.
It means infinity, or godhead.
Are you a Buddhist?
All religions are equally true.
Breakfast.
London.
The biggest money market in the world.
Did you know that?
Ten thousand million pounds a day turnover.
Ten thousand millions a day, and there's a thousand ways of making it, you know?
It's just a question of picking the right one.
Open this.
Champagne.
Of course.
Glass palaces.
Just look at them.
One day I'll own one of those.
You're very old-fashioned.
What do you mean, I'm old-fashioned?
Well, all this stuff about money and owning things.
If you want something, just take it.
I always do.
Where did you get this from?
Home.
Do you go there often?
Sometimes. When I get bored.
And where does all this other stuff come from?
That comes from home too.
Daddy's got so much he never misses anything.
You're lucky.
I've got to get there on my own.
- Get where?
- Right to the top.
How much is a building like that worth?
The ground rent is 800,000 pounds a year.
It cost 10 times that to build.
And every three months its value increases by 20 percent.
How do you know?
My father owns it.
Really?
It's beautiful.
I'd like to meet your father.
You've got lovely eyes.
Introduce us then.
I've been a top salesman.
Earned 100 pounds one week.
You're so greedy.
Tell me more about your father.
He owns half the copper mines in the world.
He's absolutely ruthless.
For every 5 million pounds he invests...
...he makes half a million pounds profit.
In Bolivia...
...he drove half a million peasants off their land.
They starved to death.
Fifty million pounds profit.
He's the most evil man you could ever hope to meet.
Are you coming or staying?
Coming.
Hey, where are you going? Don't go.
Have a good day.
Remember...
...all that glisters is not gold.
Hello, can I speak to Mr. Burgess, please?
Yes, yes, of course, sir.
Sir James, yes.
Well, it's about his daughter.
Yes, it's very urgent.
I'm sorry, but it's absolutely confidential.
It's a matter of life and death.
Well, you'll just have to interrupt him then, won't you?
Hello, Sir James?
Hello, I'm Michael Travis.
It's about Patricia. She's in trouble.
Well, she's safe at the moment but I'm not sure how long it can be guaranteed.
No, Sir James, I really cannot discuss this on the telephone.
I'm sure you understand.
Well, I do have rather a full afternoon but I could see you in say, 45 minutes.
No, Sir James, I'm not a psychiatrist.
Good. Oh, by the way, Sir James...
...which is your nearest tube station?
Thank you.
Mr. Travis?
Would you mind taking a seat and waiting a few moments?
- Sir James is still in conference.
- Thank you.
It's only a question of time.
Another six months is all I need.
Three?
No, no, no!
- You rotten bastard! You swine!
- You must calm down.
Can't you see it's a revolutionary concept?
Twenty five years of my life.
Twenty five years wasted.
Twenty five years down the drain.
- Oh, God! All wasted!
- Professor...
- Professor, you must restrain yourself.
- You bastard! You swine!
Professor.
Help me. I won't go. I'll never go.
Don't let them do it.
Miss Hunter, two Valium and a barley wine for Professor Stewart.
William, a chair for Professor Stewart.
Mr. Travis.
Sir James' time is worth
500 pounds per minute.
Please keep it short.
Mr. Michael Travis, Sir James.
Well, young man.
I won't beat about the bush, sir.
It's your...
I won't beat about the bush, sir.
It's your daughter, Patricia.
She's in bad trouble.
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, the usual.
Bad company, protests, drugs.
Oh, all that. Yes.
I think we can save her, sir.
I think she should come back to her family...
...a family background.
Do you even know where she is, sir?
It must be heart-breaking for you,
Sir James.
You amaze me.
She needs you, Sir James.
How strange.
The trouble is, I'm so frightfully busy.
No, no, no.
- I'm not gonna stand for it.
- Professor.
- Professor, please.
- I'm going back in there.
All right, if that's what you want.
But here, now, in front of your very eyes, Sir James.
- Now!
- William.
William, stop him at all costs.
- Professor, please.
- Now, now.
- Professor, for God's sake.
- Let me go!
Let me go!
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Sir James.
Ask the senior staff to come to my office.
I'm afraid I have some very grave and distressing news for you.
Professor Stewart is dead.
Professor Stewart started life 55 years ago...
...of humble parentage.
His father was a watchmaker in Glasgow.
At the age of 16, he gained a scholarship to Cambridge.
During the war his vital research into the military application of electronics...
...led to his rapid promotion to the rank of major.
After the war...
...he gave to this company the same loyalty that he had before given to the nation.
Now, Professor Stewart was not only an inventor of genius...
...but all who came in contact with him felt it a privilege to have known...
...and loved him.
Sir James, it's 10 past 5.
Your appointment with Dr. Munda.
Thank you, Miss Hunter.
Professor Stewart was too far in advance of his time...
...but his name will live long.
We will stand in silence in grateful memory for 15 seconds.
Miss Hunter, send a memo to the chief accountant.
A gratuity of 740 pound per annum to his widow.
Fix the funeral for Wednesday,
Golders Green.
And get me Vancouver.
Pity about Stewart.
Brilliant man, of course, but an academic.
Couldn't run a toffee shop.
In business there's an animal who succeeds and an animal who doesn't.
That may be my call to Vancouver.
Vancouver, Canada, Sir James.
Charles? James.
I talked to the board.
Unanimous decision, I'm afraid.
We'll have to have your resignation by midnight.
No.
Two million dollars compensation is our maximum.
Well, it's your decision of course.
But if you don't...
...things could be pretty upsetting for Kitty.
Yes.
Bye.
- Good evening, Sir James.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sir James.
- Sorry to keep you.
Had a little hold up at the office.
- My assistant, Michael...
- Travis.
- Travis.
- Morrison.
- Pleased to meet you.
- This way, sir.
Sir James, how good of you to come.
Mr. President.
My minister of finance,
Mr. Timothy Souza.
- How do you do?
- Madame Paillard.
My home secretary, Mrs. Naidu.
- How do you do?
- Colonel Steiger.
- Colonel.
- Sir.
- Mr. Oswald.
- Sir James.
And the Right Honourable Basil Keyes,
I think you know.
- Basil.
- James.
Do sit down, Sir James.
Morrison, draw the curtains.
Sir James...
...you are a man of business.
You deal in facts and figures.
Well, that is what we are here to give you today.
My colleagues and I are confident...
...that we can offer you an association with our country...
...that will be as profitable to you as to ourselves.
Film please, Brewster.
The coastline of Zingara...
...an uninterrupted stretch of golden sand, perfect for swimming, water sports...
...and all the leisure facilities demanded by holiday makers...
...from the industrial centres in Europe and the Americas.
The island already boasts one large hotel.
Visitors can take their ease in surroundings of luxury and sophistication.
- A brandy, please.
- Yes, sir.
Picturesque entertainment is provided by Zingaran natives...
...performing their age-old rituals...
...for patrons of our holiday lodges in the hill district.
Here in surroundings of peace and calm...
...staffs are being specially trained satisfy
European demands for courtesy and service.
A massive program of hotel construction is already underway.
Experienced European engineers are supervising the native labour force...
...in the construction of the Zingara Continental Hotel.
Your brandy, sir.
The completed hotel, with its splendid public facilities...
...provides 500 rooms.
Each with colour television and private bathroom.
Thank you, Brewster.
Very attractive.
But your plans for industry?
Our free export zone will offer generous advantages...
...to all concerns financed by foreign capital.
Repatriation of profits?
Mr. Souza.
Guaranteed to any country you care to nominate.
Venezuela, the Vatican,
Liechtenstein, et cetera.
Oh, thanks very much.
Labour costs?
My home secretary, Mrs. Naidu, will explain the favourable arrangements...
...we are planning for this area.
Labour conditions in Zingara offer excellent opportunities...
...for the foreign investor.
Rates of pay and working conditions are regulated by the government.
Consequently, strikes and slowdowns are a thing unknown.
Film, Brewster, please.
The efficiency and variety of our light industrial installations are a joy to behold.
The Bumangi sausage factory has a daily output of over 2000 pounds...
...prime first-quality sausages.
All 75 percent genuine meat.
Special attention is paid to cleanliness.
Experience has shown that production levels benefit considerably...
...when the sexes are segregated.
The workers' living quarters are also segregated.
Here is an ultra-modern male workers' camp on the outskirts of Bikana.
Their women are housed in a similar camp some 35 miles distant.
Male workers are paid the equivalent of 7 New-English pence per day...
...and females, at 3.
Foreign technicians are welcome in Zingara.
Life for our foreign visitors will be fully commensurate...
...with the standards of living and convenience...
...enjoyed by their colleagues in America or the European Common Market.
They will also be exempted from all personal income tax.
Thank you.
Thank you, Sir James.
Well, Sir James.
I hope we have convinced you that Zingara today presents a unique opportunity...
...for secure investment and a high rate of return.
There is just one consideration...
...that troubles me, Mr. President.
- Please.
What guarantees can you provide for the safe-guarding of investment?
I refer, of course, to the threat of insurrection.
Sir James...
...I will be completely honest.
It is true that a small element of our people...
...have been attempting to cause unrest in our northern territories.
This problem we have firmly in hand.
We're fortunate to have the services of Colonel Steiger...
...whose achievements in the Congo,
Nigeria and more recently, Bangladesh...
...must be well-known to you.
I have asked Colonel Steiger himself to report on the situation.
The rebels number roughly
2000 men and women.
Projection.
They are operating in the northern territories in two main groups.
My counter-offensive has taken the form of a two-pronged blitz...
...blanket bombardment by artillery and aircraft...
...followed by landings of airborne policing detachments...
...employing scorched-earth and random-elimination techniques.
My men are professionals, experienced in guerilla warfare.
The rebels are amateurs, inexperienced and weak in defence.
So insurgent losses are heavy.
Over 300 killed.
Four hundred and fifty captured and interned.
In view of your undoubted superiority,
Colonel Steiger...
...can you tell us why this insurrection still persists?
The terrain is unfavourable, sir.
Jungle and swamp favour the native.
That is why we need honey.
Honey?
Precisely.
Your British honey.
The substance known as PL-45.
Or in the terminology of my profession, "honey."
Let me show you some examples.
Slide, please.
This is a man who has received a light exposure to this invaluable weapon.
And again.
And again.
And again.
And again.
A beer mug full of honey can create a lethal zone...
...for all forms of terrestrial life within an area of 15 acres.
Low-flying aircraft spraying PL-45...
...can cover 100 square miles in two hours.
Thank you.
This is all I need to finish the job.
Impressive.
But you understand, Colonel Steiger...
...that granted supplies of adequate quantities of honey...
...you are prepared to guarantee the internal stability of your territory?
You have my word.
Basil, a moment.
Champagne, monsieur?
- Thank you very much, ma'am.
- Please.
Thank you.
Glad to see you made it, old boy.
Stick with the old man.
You'll run a good wicket. Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Yes
Yes.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I don't think you've met my new assistant, Travis.
Travis, this is Basil Keyes.
I could send Travis along sometime tomorrow.
We've got a night sitting, that should finish before lunch.
- So anywhere near the House of Commons.
- Right.
Mr. President, I'll take these documents home with me, if I may.
Study them thoroughly.
I shan't keep you waiting.
- Well, it must be all of 40 years.
- Thirty nine.
- I shared digs with the president's brother.
- How nice.
I shall never forget that wonderful spring morning in your room at Balliol.
You and Peter drunk on the bookshelves.
Karl Marx and Keynes on the floor.
- How is Peter?
- In detention, alas.
I was urged to hang him but for once I was weak.
"Power creates the man." Tacitus.
Cheers.
Thank you, Warner.
About half an hour.
- She never gets out of bed.
- Oh, rotten luck.
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Frank.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Mr. Travis will have a...
- A dry martini, very dry.
- Dry martini, Frank, and a large scotch.
- Thank you, sir.
I don't think you'll run into any trouble.
They've got their briefing.
They're all good chaps.
Everything's under control.
Good luck.
And don't leave any fingerprints.

Hello, there.
- There you are.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you. Travis.
- Wallis.
- Had a good run down?
- Fine, thank you. Fine.
Got the bumf, have you?
Good.
Nearly there.
Good, good, good.
We're over here.
Sergeant Beevers.
We've got the okay to take off.
Do the necessary, will you?
Yes, sir.
Ground control to pilot/navigator.
Destination Honey.
Flight AT-060 is Zingara International Airport.
Take off one-five minutes.
Roger, ground control. Will do.
- Sign by the cross, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Twelve thousand gallons of the stuff there.
You could do half East Africa with that, Mr. Travis.
And of course, it was your flag that went up and ours that came down.
And the extraordinary thing was that the duchess never even noticed.
That will be all, thank you, Jenkins.
Well, gentlemen, to business.
Sir James, we would like the first instalment.
In cash.
Travis.
This is the combination to the safe in my study.
You will find a case there.
- Bring it here.
- Sir.
- Please, darling.
- Please, Dickey.
- But you must.
- Oh, don't go on, Dickey.
I've never been very sure of myself.
Not until I found you.
You drink too much.
I know.
You're my last chance.
Oh, little Dickey.
My God.
Michael.
Patricia.
What are you doing here?
This is my home.
- Well, who was that?
- Dickey?
The Duke of Belminster.
He's an old friend of mine.
What does he want?
He wants to marry me.
Well, you can't.
I might. I haven't decided yet.
But I love you and I'm going to marry you.
Look.
Oh, Michael.
You're so hopelessly conventional.
I told you I was gonna be a success.
And I am.
I did warn you.
Wait here for me.
Thank you, Michael.
Sir James, we need a witness.
Travis.
Who?
I see.
Yes.
Of course not.
Show them up.
The fraud squad.
Now, please, everyone, keep quite calm.
Inspector Carding is a very decent fellow.
Mr. Souza, if you please.
Travis.
Put those in your pocket.
The case please. Sit down.
Hold this.
Inspector Carding.
Good evening, inspector.
Good evening, Sir James.
- I'm sorry to disturb you, Sir James.
- Not at all.
I think you know everybody here.
Except perhaps my new assistant,
Michael Travis.
He hasn't been with me very long.
It is Mr. Travis I wish to interview.
With your permission, of course.
Now, is there anyone here you recognize?
Yes.
That is the man.
Thank you, Beevers.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Travis, may I have that bag?
Just a minute.
Did you sign this, sir?
Yes.
Is this your signature, sir?
Yes.
Is this your signature, sir?
No.
Is this your signature, sir?
Oh, no.
Complete forgery.
Not worth the paper it's written on.
Bag, please.
Do you realize it's an offence to export bullion from the U.K. Without...
...the permission of the Bank of England?
- Yes.
When I came into this room, that bag was in your possession?
Yes.
Would you mind, sir?
All right, Michael.
Trust me.
I'll take that, Carding.
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you,
Sir James
Dr. Munda.
The dividing line...
...between the House of Lords and Pentonville jail is very, very thin.

Now, Travis, was given a position of great trust by his benefactor.
One of England's most eminent industrialists.
He repaid that trust...
...by seeking to export for his own gain,
10 million pounds...
...of his employer's money.
Was this the action of an innocent?
If such perfidy can be committed without fear of retribution...
...then how can the rule of law, patriotism, duty...
...the very basis of our society, hope to survive?
Well, go and consider your verdict carefully.
And take your time.
Be upstanding in court.
Be upstanding in court.
Members of the jury...
...have you arrived at a verdict on which you are all agreed?
- We have, My Lord.
- Do you find the prisoner guilty...
...or not guilty?
- Guilty, My Lord.
May I say how entirely I agree with that verdict.
The prisoner will stand to receive sentence.
Society is based on good faith...
...on a commonly accepted bond.
It is the inflamed greed of people like you,
Michael Travis...
...that has led to the present breakdown of our society.
Before I pass sentence, have you anything to say?
My Lord, I did my duty.
I only wanted to be successful.
I did my best.
And you failed.
I am innocent, My Lord.
I sentence you to five years hard labour.
Come on. There we are.
Yeah.
Come on. Come on.
Yes. Come on.
Let's have a look at you.
There we are. Be gentle, be gentle.
Let's have a look.
Oh, that's better.
Yes, there we are, hold still.
Yeah.
All right, Travis, you've done your stretch.
Now smarten up for the governor.
Well done, lad.
Well, Travis, you're free.
Free to rejoin the world of decent, ordinary men and women...
...who are content to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brows.
The brotherhood of man, Travis.
I know where I went wrong, sir.
I've been thinking.
Good lad.
I've read books...
...and I see things differently now, sir.
Well, now, tell me.
Have you...?
Have you any plans?
No plans, sir.
I just want to get out there and learn to be a proper human being, sir.
I'd like to...
I'd like to read you something.
I think it may help.
"One that never turned his back but marched breast forward...
...never doubted clouds would break...
...never dreamed that wrong would triumph...
...held we fall to rise...
...sleep to wake."
I'd like you to have this.
It belonged to my grandmother...
...but you may find it will help you through the difficult days that lie ahead.
Thank you very much, sir.
I've sensed the spark of idealism in you...
...and that can move mountains, you know that?
Oh, for a man like you, Travis...
Michael, for a boy like you, you're still young.
Everything is possible.
The world is your oyster.
I can see you stripped, building motorways.
You have eyes like Steve McQueen.
Did anyone ever tell you that?
Goodbye, Travis.
And good luck.
MacIntyre.
Biles.
Eccles.
Travis.
Goodbye.
Bye, Frank.
Goodbye, old chap.
I'll send you a postcard.
Goodbye.
- Lawrence!
- Mommy!
Thank you, Michael, for everything.
Goodbye. Best of luck.
Thank you.
On your own?
- On your own then?
- Yes.
- Anywhere to go?
- I'll manage.
Just a minute.
- Do you want a lift?
- No, thanks. I'm going the other way.
Here.
- What is it?
- Down in the East End.
Give you a start there.
Be good.
I won't be seeing you anymore.
Well, good luck.
It may not be as easy as you think.

Oh, sure I would.
Are you sure you can spare it?
Gladly.
- You're from the prison, aren't you?
- That's right.
There's no need to be ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
Glory, hallelujah!
Major! Major!
Major.
~ boundless stores of grace ~
...and he's just come out of prison too.
Brothers, today we have with us a young man...
...who has turned over a completely new leaf.
He has only just left prison...
...yet he has given generously of his meagre store.
Glory, hallelujah.
Friend, will you step up beside me and bear witness?
Bear witness? What to?
Your sins.
I don't believe in sin.
Everybody sins. We know.
Brother, be warned, you stand in great danger.
I thought like you once, sir, but now I've learned better.
People are good if you give them the chance.
Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, sorry. You all right?
- Sorry, sorry.
We've got to start with humanity.
We must try and trust one another.
People are good.
Everyone has goodness in them.
It's poverty.
That's why people commit crimes.
It's not poverty, laddie.
It's the old Adam pride, envy, gluttony, sloth.
A great philosopher once wrote something I'd like you all to hear.
"My country is the world, and my religion is to do good."
Tom Paine.
Tom Paine denied God.
He believed in mankind.
Brother, we will pray for you.
Let us all kneel together, friends.
Oh, Lord, look down in mercy on this, our misguided brother.
Guide his feet into the way of life.
Remove the blindfold from his eyes.
Lift up his gaze to the eternal hills...
...from whence cometh our only help.
Amen.

What are you trying to do, pick apples?
He thinks he's picking apples.

- No, not you. You.
Bring up that blinking bar.
- Just behind you.
- The big one behind...
- That's right.
- That's right.

- Up here.

- Bring it up here.
- Up here, hurry.
- Quick, upstairs.
- Come quick.
Mighty improvement you are.
Up here. Get this door open.
Give us your bag.
- Mrs. Richards.
- Come out of there.
Come on out.
She's put the bed against the door.
Double bolted it.
She's gonna do it this time, you mark my words.
Selfish bitch.
She's got the kids in there with her.
But she'll probably do them in and all.
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
She's gonna kill herself, that's what's wrong.
- Well, can't you stop her?
- Well, go on then, you stop her.
- Nobody's holding you back, are they?
- Mrs. Richards!
Mrs. Richards!
What you gonna do?
- It's dangerous.
- Oh, my God.
He'll never make it.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, now, don't.

Mrs. Richards, what are you doing?
Cleaning the floor, what's it look like?
What's all this about killing yourself?
I've had enough.
You've been shut up here too long.
Think of the world outside.
Mrs. Richards. Now, please stop it.
I want you to listen.
My husband has to find the place looking nice.
I'll not have him saying
I did wrong in the end.
You should meet some people.
Make some nice friends.
I haven't been out since we had Penny.
Not in six years.
- Well, take a holiday.
- Harry's off work.
- Hasn't had a job for four years.
- Well, think of the children.
- I mean, they're the only ones who matter.
- How can I keep a child clean?
How much do you think a pair of kid's shoes costs?
The cheapest? One pound twenty.
Life is a gift, Mrs. Richards.
You haven't the right to throw it away.
Look, this is the food I buy each week for ourselves and the kids:
Seven loaves of bread,
20 pounds of potatoes...
...three quarters of a pound of tea, a packet of porridge...
...two packs of cornflakes.
- There's always tomorrow.
One pack of Co-op soap powder, three or four pounds of cabbage...
...two swedes, custard powder...
...baked beans, sometimes, tinned tomatoes, sometimes...
...tinned spaghetti, sometimes, lettuce, when cheap.
Food isn't everything.
Fresh air! Sunshine...
- Penny!
- Yes, Mum.
Bring the Brasso.
Now, I want you to go over there, love.
Wash the big pan under the hot tap.
Get out every bit of tomato soup before your dad gets back.
Mrs. Richards...
Mrs. Richards...
Please listen to this, Mrs. Richards.
Now, please listen.
"Life is mostly froth and bubble, two things stand like stone.
Kindness in another's trouble, courage in your own."
Who said that?
Adam Lindsay Gordon. He was a poet.
More of a fool, if you ask me.
Well, wait then, Mrs. Richards.
Now, wait, Mrs. Richards.
Wait, Mrs. Richards.
Listen to this. Please, Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Richards.
Tell Harry to leave a note for the milkman.
Two pints.
- Penny.
- Yes, Mum?
"There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow." Hamlet.
Go on, go and sit over there.
Be a good girl.
Please listen, Mrs. Richards.
Please listen to this.
Now, this will really help, Mrs. Richards.
Please listen carefully.
"One that never turned his back but marched breast forward...
...never doubted clouds would break."
Don't do anything rash, Mrs. Richards.
Every cloud has a silver lining,
Mrs. Richards. Mrs. Richards!
Mrs. Richards!
~ Down on the corner of the street
Where I was born we used to meet ~
~ And sing the old songs
We called them dole songs ~
~ And we'd harmonize so clear
Even though it was the beer ~
~ That made the tears run
About the years gone by ~
~ And we'd go home and kiss the wife ~
~ Hoping a kiss could change your life ~
~ That's how romance is
No second chances ~

No queue jumping. Keep in line.
Remember, only one bun each.
Nice and hot.
That's a nice coat you've got.
Are you feeling better now, Arthur?
- Got black locks in my bed again.
- Oh, chin up. Better than rats.
Have some bread and butter.
- Have you got any jam?
- Yes.
Tuck in.
Hello, a new face.
Oh, don't by shy. Down on your luck?
Here, you get this inside you.
- Watch out, it's hot.
- Thank you.
Arthur, you are making a mess.
I'll do that for you.
He likes it thick.
Oh, super. Thanks awfully.
Oh, good girl, Vera. That's lovely.
- Jam?
- Thank you so much.
There.
Arthritis. Incurable.
Be dead in six months, poor old thing.
- Do you do this every night?
- Whenever I can.
Well, I have so much time in the evenings.
Do you get paid for it?
Good Lord, no. It's just that one has to do what one can to help.
Can I help?
That's extremely kind.
I can use all the help I can get.
Here, you grab hold of this.
Any more cups, please? Won't be a jiff.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Good night.
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.
They do so appreciate it.
Even I need sleep, of course.
It gets a bit of a grind on one's own.
Even the strongest stumble.
But one does what one can.
Now, do you see that bonfire over there?
That's all my regulars.
Now, you just toddle across and give them their soup.
You'll find some of them a bit touchy, but they're all real characters.
Yes, but what shall I say?
What shall I do?
Well, it's simple, just be yourself.
Don't put on an act. They don't like that.
- Well, where are you going?
- I've got the railway stations to do.
Oh, leave the impedimenta at the side of the road.
Be back about 5.
Bye.
Bye!
Hot soup?
Hot soup?
Cat's piss.
Do you have any pepper?
Do you have any pepp...?
Soup?
Hot soup, sir?
Sorry, son, I can't take solids.
Hot soup?
My God, Patricia.
Michael.
I thought you were going to marry the Duke of Belminster.
This is the Duke of Belminster.
Leave him alone.
We don't want your filthy charity!
Get back to school!
Get out of here!
- Listen, friends, comrades...
- Go back to nanny!
- Listen to me, comrades.
- Join the army!
- Listen to me, brothers.
- Brothers? We ain't your bleeding brothers.
You're men. You must realize it.
Men, mankind, brothers...
...it's the only truth.
- Truth?
This is the only truth, you bastard.
Man!
No, it's you, me, all of us.
We're all there is. Only man exists.
Man, listen to it.
What a marvellous word.
Isn't it a marvellous word?
It's fantastic. We must respect it.
We must respect each other.
Not charity, not pity, but dignity, respect.
I know, I swear it.
We must love one another.
Love!
Brothers!
Brothers, brothers, brothers!
Brothers!

Swan. He has no other name.
His past is a mystery, but his work is already a legend.
He wrote and produced his first gold record at 14.
Since then, he's won so many...
...that he tried to deposit them in Fort Knox.
He brought the blues to Britain.
He brought Liverpool to America.
He brought folk and rock together.
His band, the Juicy Fruits...
...single-handedly gave birth to the nostalgia wave in the '70s.
Now he's looking for the new sound of the spheres...
...to inaugurate his own Xanadu, his own Disneyland...
...the Paradise, the ultimate rock palace.
This film is the story of that search, of that sound...
...of the man who made it, the girl who sang it...
...and the monster who stole it.
It seems like yesterday
I found Annette in that church choir.
I got her singing lessons, taught her how to dress, got her first gig.
I paid off a columnist.
He did a beautiful story on her.
I told her who to be nice to, who to...
I fed her drugs to get through the tours, made her record a hit.
Then you made her the biggest thing in rock.
So now what does she do?
She fires us, cancels Vegas...
...and gives free concerts for gook orphans.
She was more than a piece.
She was the light of my life.
And now she's gone.
There'll be a 20-minute intermission before the next show.
We sued her. We couldn't lose.
We had an ironclad contract.
It was a lock, it was over, it was closed. I even bribed the judge.
He said we couldn't sign anyone to a life contract.
Called us a disgrace to the profession. A disgrace.
I made her the moneygrubbing whore she was, and I'm a disgrace?
- What do you want me to do?
- Break her.
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
Annette is nothing, finished, washed up.
- She's at the top of the charts.
- That's today, Philbin.
Tomorrow she'll be forgotten.
We have more important business.
- The Paradise.
- I know. We've looked everywhere...
Listen.
What?
That's it.
The music to open the Paradise.
- I've finally found it.
- That creep to open the Paradise?
No, not him. The music.
Listen to the music.
What do I do with him?
You'll think of something.
- Mr. Leach?
- Hello.
My name's Arnold Philbin.
I scout talent for Swan.
He's interested in your stuff.
- The Swan?
- That's right.
- He said your song could be big.
- Really?
I was right there.
If he produced my music, the world would listen.
The game plan exactly, but you need a lot of work, polishing.
I know. I have a long way to go.
- Do you have any tapes of your stuff?
- No, but it's all written down here.
- Give us two or three good up numbers.
- Two or three?
This cantata is 200 or 300 pages, and I haven't finished yet.
Forget the sonata.
We just want the songs.
- It's not just songs. It's much more.
- I don't get you.
It's a whole series of songs that tell a story of Faust.
- Who? What label's he on?
- He was a legendary German magician.
He sold his soul to the devil for worldly power.
What is this, kid? School time?
A song is a song.
You either dig it, or you don't.
Now, I like your stuff, kid.
It's terrific. And you know what?
I think the Juicy Fruits will dig it.
I'm not promising anything. First...
I won't let my music be mutilated by those greaseballs!
- Only I can sing Faust!
- It was just an idea.
Swan makes all these decisions, you know?
I'm sorry. It's just that
I worked so hard on this thing.
- It's okay. You sure got a temper.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know what comes over me.
- Just relax. Take it easy.
Give me the music. Swan will take a look and get right back to you.
But if you ask me, I think we're gonna produce your first album.
Really?
- Hello. I'm Winslow Leach.
- Yes?
Mr. Philbin said Mr. Swan would call about producing my record.
He said he'd get back to me.
That was a month ago.
One moment, please.
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Follow that car.
- Where did you get that song?
- From Philbin, to audition with.
- Sing it again.
- Why?
Go ahead. Sing it.
That's incredible.
How'd you know it went like that?
- I wrote the song.
- Then why aren't you with Swan?
- There must be some mix-up.
- Oh, sure.
Your name's not on the music.
Swan heard me sing this. Why's he auditioning girls for my cantata?
- I only sing it solo.
- Haven't you heard?
- He's opening the Paradise with it.
- You're kidding.
- I look like a kidder?
- He's using my cantata?
- Isn't that great?
- I wish he'd told me.
He's just auditioning girls for a backup chorus.
You're a fine singer.
You shouldn't be in a chorus.
I don't care where I sing this music.
Hey, look. Could you help me?
I can sing these songs better than anybody.
With your help,
I can get in the chorus.
- I'd love to help you.
- You're not just being nice?
Personal desire never influences my aesthetic judgment.
- What's that mean?
- It means I think you're terrific.
Do you?
Everybody get in line, gotta quick it up a bit. Move in quietly.
One, two, three, four...
Come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Wait a minute. Stop.
What's that, a boyfriend?
- I'm the composer.
- Great.
- Swan's only seeing girls.
- I must see...
If you wanna see Swan, call and make an appointment.
- I got thrown out.
- They don't wanna see you.
- But I wrote the music.
- Just get out of here!
- Winslow, I'll tell him you're here.
- I'll wait for you. Good luck.
Why won't he just let me sing?
It was awful.
- What's the matter?
- Philbin tried to... I can't do it.
- I came here to sing. Leave me alone.
- Did you tell him who I am?
- What's your name?
- Hey! Come here, buddy.
- Where's a good department store?
- We'll take you.
- When do we get to sing?
- Not much singing happens here.
I've been here 12 times, and I still haven't sung.
- What do you do here?
- You'll see.
- Can't you sing on your back?
- I've never tried.
If you can sing standing up, you can sing lying down.
- Take your slip off.
- No, I'm saving it for Swan.
- Do it now.
- You're being auditioned right now.
- What?
- The whole place is bugged.
- You're kidding.
- No, Swan's watching us right now.
- Come here.
- What are you doing?
- He likes to watch us.
- Watch us doing what?
- Doing each other.
- Really?
- It turns him on.
- Does he like blondes?
I like blondes.
Do you mind?
I hate to bother you, but...
That's right, I...
Just hold me close. I just...
I need someone to help me warm my voice up.
Swan!
Mr. Swan, you remember me.
I'm Winslow Leach.
May we rehearse?
Over here, Swan.
- Get this fag out of here.
- It's me. Winslow. Don't you remember?
I gave Mr. Philbin a copy of my cantata, Faust.
You were gonna look at it.
You're auditioning girls for my work.
I'm Winslow Leach! I wrote it!
Where are you taking me?
Telephone.
That's him.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you some kind of pervert?
- No, sir. I'm...
- I'm Winslow Leach, the composer.
- What are you doing outside Swanage?
Listen, officers, you gotta help me.
Mr. Swan's got my music.
He pretends he doesn't know me.
He had me thrown out and beaten up.
- He didn't want to buy what you had.
- He said nothing about buying.
Jack, what's that he got in his purse?
I don't know, Joe. Take a look.
- I think I will.
- Mr. Swan said he had it on him.
What do you know?
Smack, Jack.
- You know the penalty for pushing?
- Life!
But I'm innocent!
Swan stole my music and framed me!
Welcome to Sing Sing.
We're very fortunate to be included in the Dental Health Research Program.
This is a volunteer program funded by the Swan Foundation.
You are all volunteers.
All your teeth will be pulled.
Teeth are a source of infection.
It pays to be on the safe side.
Sir?
Pardon me. I'm not a volunteer.
I'm innocent. I don't want you to take my teeth out.
How many men here are innocent?
Raise your hands.
All innocent.
Good morning, everyone.
Swan can deposit another golden disk in Fort Knox.
The Juicy Fruits on the Death Label has taken the charts by storm.
Friday night, you can see them at the grand opening of the Paradise.
Swan's rock palace...
...is scheduled to open at last with this dynamite sound.
So let's hear it again. The
Juicy Fruits singing Swan's Faust.
Get away from the record press.
- Let's move this ladder now.
- What's that?
I shove the tire in his mouth.
Then he really gets mad at me, you know?
This is the last time we go through it. See Swan?
He's listening and watching, so don't make me look bad again.
All right, let's get going here, will you, please?
Let's get it going over here.
Get the car over there.
All right, girls.
Just a second, Linda.
You got a very nice body.
We want to see some skin.
- It's cold. It's just a rehearsal.
- You're not paid to be cold.
- Don't touch me.
- You wanna get paid?
- Yeah, I wanna get paid.
- Get back on the car.
Come on, let's move it out of here.
We've gotta get some thin girls here.
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get out of here.
- What sign are you?
- Leo.
You're okay. I gotta get out of here.
- Come on, I wanna show you something.
- I swear to God.
Do you see Swan up there?
He doesn't show it, but he's thinking:
"Why isn't Harold in the car?"
Do you really want me to tell him that it's not in the stars for you?
I don't feel good.
You'll feel worse if you don't do what I say.
- I hear this ticking.
- Maybe something's loose up there.
- There's something weird here.
- Take one of these.
- I can't take pills...
- Take the pills, swallow. Feel better?
- Yeah, I feel better.
- No more ticking?
Get out there. All right.
Come on, get this car out.
Girls, I want big smiles now.
Look at the audience. That's it.
Big smiles. Sing the song.
Winslow, good to see you.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Killing me won't help you.
My God, you're horrible.
Don't rush off.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself!
What's that horrible sound?
Can't you talk?
Look around you, Winslow.
You've destroyed your face, your voice.
Now you're trying to destroy the Paradise. Haven't we had enough?
I can give you the power to create.
I'll make you somebody.
We'll have to start over, only this time working together.
The time for your sound is now.
People will want to hear your music.
Tomorrow, I'll put a whole new group together who'll do your songs.
Come to the auditions.
You'll see for yourself. Trust me!
Trust me.
Next!
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Phoenix.
- Let's see what you got.
- Do I get to sing this time?
- You mean you're really a singer?
- Yes, I'm a singer.
Try to forget it. We're not looking for singers. We're looking for screamers.
I'm not a screamer. I'm a singer.
Phoenix.
Swan here.
- I want you to answer a question.
- Yes?
What would you give me to sing?
Anything you wanted.
Anything?
Would you give me your voice?
Try me.
She's good...
...isn't she?
Then let's talk.
Filters.
Dolbys.
Perfect.
- How's that? Try it.
- Phoenix.
Try it again.
And again.
At least you can talk. Plug yourself into the console to sing.
- You really think she's that good?
- Too good for you.
I'll hire her anyway.
She could be my voice now.
Could she? Really?
Stop terrorizing the Paradise and rewrite your cantata...
...for Phoenix. We'll both win.
You get your cantata sung by the right singer, I open Paradise.
We can't waste time.
Lock yourself up in here and write.
- I could write for her.
- It'll be performed here live.
- Phoenix will star.
- My cantata. For her.
I'll get fantastic musicians.
The hall has...
I don't trust you.
You ruined my music before.
Forget about the Juicy Fruits.
Who wants nostalgia anymore?
- I don't trust you.
- No need. Here's a contract.
Everything I've said and more is in it.
- I'll read it.
- At your leisure.
"The party of the first part gives the party of the second part...
...full power to do with him at their pleasure, to rule, send, fetch...
...or carry him or his, be it either body, soul, flesh or blood."
- What does that mean?
- That's a transportation clause.
"All articles...
...which are excluded shall be deemed included."
- What does that mean?
- That's a clause to protect you.
Anyway, what difference does it make?
What choice do you have?
I'll rewrite my cantata, but you'd best play what I write.
Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow.
Now sign.
Excellent.
And now we're in business together.
Forever.
I'll rewrite my cantata, but you'd best play what I write.
Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow.
Now sign.
Excellent.
And now we're in business together.
Forever.
Tasty, Winslow, tasty.
- But I thought you liked her, boss.
- I do. She's perfect.
But you know how I abhor perfection in anyone but myself.
Then Phoenix is out?
No, not out. Just a backup singer.
My cantata needs something really heavy.
No, no.
Wrong again.
Pretty, but no.
No.
There's something here like...
- How come we don't get to take photos?
- They have exclusive rights to him.
- Where's he coming in from?
- Transylvania. Swan will go anywhere...
Remember, no pictures of Swan.
Gentlemen, I want to tell you of our latest work. An opera.
A kind of pop cantata.
It was written by the late Winslow Leach.
It is about a young man who sells his soul to the devil...
...to become a pop star. It'll be the first rock version of Faust.
We'll be recording at the Paradise, Friday night.
Live on the Death Label.
- Mr. Pizer.
- Who's singing this? The Juicy Fruits?
No. They're a reflection of the past.
Gentlemen, I give you the future:
Beef.
Winslow. Good morning.
- What day is it?
- Thursday. Today is Thursday.
Breakfast.
A little pick-me-up.
How's it coming?
Don't mean to rush you.
Don't worry. It'll be finished.
How's Phoenix?
- I can't wait to hear her sing.
- Doing beautifully.
Can't wait to meet you, by the way.
Tomorrow's the big night.
Tomorrow night.
You better get a castrato.
This is a little out of my range.
- Something bothering you, Beef?
- This was scored for a chick.
- I'm not doing it in drag.
- You sing it better than any bitch.
You don't know how right you are, Goliath.
Okay, boys, from the bridge. Hit it.
- Who says I can't sing it?
- I like it. Keep working on it.
Drop an octave here, change a line there.
Make it completely yours.
Let's go.
Far out.
Doesn't that change the whole thing?
You heard him. Make it yours. If it's good, who cares what it's about?
Is that so?
- Nobody cares what it's about.
- Is that right?
- Who listens to lyrics anyway?
- Dry up, tubbo.
Seal it now.
This creep gets no comps.
My music! Swan!
- What was that?
- What was what?
I knew I shouldn't screw around with a dead man's music. This place...
...is possessed.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear that shriek?
That was something trying to get out of its premature grave.
Opening night prima donnas.
Look, iron man...
...you're uptight. Take a shower.
- My pleasure...
...Bones.
Never sing my music again. Not here, not anywhere. Do you understand?
Only Phoenix can sing my music.
Anyone else that tries, dies.
Let's see your tickets.
Everybody's got to have a ticket.
- Everybody have a ticket. You got one?
- Sure.
Get back in line.
Take care of the rest of the line.
Open the gate.
Where do you think you're going, Tinkerbell?
- Cincinnati, to see my mother.
- You're gonna miss the show.
- There ain't gonna be no show.
- What?
Listen, Philbin.
There really is a phantom.
He was just in my shower.
He threatened my life. He said his music is just for Phoenix.
Only she can sing it.
Anyone else who tries, dies.
What the hell are you talking about?
Look, Philbin, I am a professional.
I have been in this business a long time.
I don't want to do the show.
Not because I got stage fright...
...but because some creature from beyond doesn't want me to.
- Bullshit! What really happened?
- Can't you feel the vibes?
Bad, sport, real bad.
The karma's so thick, you need an Aqua Lung to breathe.
- I know what it is.
- Why don't you tell me?
- Speed, that's what it is.
- What do you know about it?
You just pass it out, I take it.
I know drug-real from real-real.
- Do me a favor and take this.
- No, that'll bring me down.
You better come down.
You better get yourself together.
You got a show to do. It's opening night. Can you still sing?
Sure, I can still sing.
The Phantom! Help!
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!
We want Beef! We want Beef!
We want Beef!
Somebody get rid of him.
- Get out there and sing.
- You're crazy.
Someone killed Beef so you could sing.
If you don't, there'll be more bodies.
- Is Beef...?
- Dead.
But let's not talk about that.
Let's talk about you.
I like your name.
We won't have to change it.
You're going to be a very big star.
We'll finish the cantata tomorrow night...
...we'll record, we'll go on tour and then...
There are no words to express what you're going to become.
I'll do anything you want.
I owe you everything.
- Just give me that crowd again.
- Tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night, they'll be yours.
- Mine.
And all I want...
...is your voice.
Is that all?
No.
We'll go to Swanage and celebrate.
I'll wait for you in the car.
He wouldn't listen to me.
- Where is she?
- Have you ever seen such a crowd?
- I never want to see another one.
- They've been entertained.
They never want the show to stop.
The Paradise is more magnificent than I dreamed.
- How often is a star fried on-stage?
- It's an attraction.
- Don't hurt me.
- I would never hurt you, Phoenix.
You know me?
I'm Winslow. Remember?
- But Winslow is dead.
- No, not quite.
Who are you?
Why do you wear that mask?
Because Swan has taken my voice, my music...
...and given me this. And now he wants you. But you're all I have left.
No one will sing in this Paradise again, no one will sing my Faust.
No one but you. Leave this place, or I'll destroy you too.
Why should I go with you? Don't you hear them? Why should I give that up?
They want much more now.
More than you could ever give.
- I'll give them whatever they want.
- No!
Get your hands off me!
With that freak, the Paradise is done.
It's beginning.
Tomorrow, Phoenix will finish Faust.
There she is.
- Beef's killer is on the roof.
- Get the police.
Don't think about it. Tonight is your night. I won't have it ruined.
Swanage.
What a foolish thing to do.
Didn't you read your contract closely?
See where it says
"terms of agreement"?
"This contract terminates with Swan."
No more suicides.
You gave up your right to rest in peace when you signed the contract.
But if you do find a loophole, forget it.
That stays sealed as long as I have the power to bind you.
If I'm destroyed, that gaping wound opens.
You might say we terminate together.
Now get back to work.
We need new love songs for Phoenix.
If you as much as say boo to anyone...
...you'll never see Phoenix again.
Oh, yes, about the love songs.
- Perhaps a duet?
- Never.
I'm under contract too.
Do we get to shoot pictures of you tonight?
Is it true you'll wear a mask on-stage?
How can we shoot you if you have a mask?
You can't, fools.
It was genius, making the end of the opera a wedding.
Faust, instead of burning in hell, he gets the girl?
And you will be the priest.
I've never been a priest before.
That's terrific.
Swan, you remember me, don't you?
You do, don't you?
- Do you know him?
- We went steady in high school.
- You're old enough to be his mother.
- This was taken 20 years ago.
My God! He doesn't look any different.
Saturday...
...November 19, 1953.
Today, I have decided to kill myself.
In being the greatest showman of my time...
...I'm recording live for the Swan Archives.
Why?
Simple.
I'm getting old.
I can't bear...
...to see this beautiful face ravaged by the forces of time.
If I can't be young forever...
...I'd rather end it all. Now.
- Why not?
- What?
Stay young forever.
I'm real. And I'll leave if you want. But you did call me.
I didn't call anybody.
You said you wanted to be young forever.
Well, here I am.
But I am stoned.
You're not real.
Then it really doesn't matter what happens, does it?
- What is going to happen?
- For openers, you'll look like me.
Forever.
This is too much. I guess you're supposed to be the devil?
- I go by many names.
- And you will make me young forever?
This image will age in your place.
This picture gets old instead of me?
Yes. And you must watch it every day, just to see how lucky you are.
- I'm crazy about pictures of myself.
- The tape from which it comes...
...must be guarded at all costs.
- Why?
When it goes, you go.
- What do I have to do?
- It's all here. Read it carefully.
Then sign at the bottom in blood.
- Blood? My blood?
- Messy, I know.
But it's the only way
I can bind you. Tradition.
What do you have to lose?
Nothing.
I was gonna use this on my wrist.
Your soul is damned either way.
What soul?
Don't waste it.
Now sign.
Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow.
Now sign.
Just sign this, and it will all be legal.
"Till death do us part"?
Mustn't be late for your own funer... Wedding.
Aren't we rushing things a little?
- Blood!
- Stop wasting it! Sign your name.
P-H-O...
She must be hit when Philbin says:
"Till death do you part."
This may not be my business, but why kill her here, tonight?
An assassination live on TV, coast-to-coast? That's entertainment.
When it goes, you go.
Do you, Phoenix, take Swan for your wedded husband?
From this day forward, for better, for worse?
- In sickness and in health?
- I do.
Do you, Swan, take Phoenix for your wedded wife?
From this day forward, for better, for worse. In sickness and in health...
...till death...
Oh, my God!
What's happened to your face?
Winslow!
I don't understand.
Your voice, remember?
You promised me your voice.
Our contract, remember?
Winslow.
Come on, boys.
Hey, Captain, why the haste?
The city will not vanish.
It is not the city of Charak he wishes to see, but someone who dwells within.
After a long voyage it's good to stretch one's legs.
The only good thing about this port is the inn of Abu Jamil.
I have been dreaming of his roasted sheep's eyes.
- And I of the eyes of his daughter.
- You're dreaming of more than her eyes.
- Captain, my mouth is dry.
- Let's sample the wines of Charak.
- My thirst is of a thousand men.
- If you drink, you'll go no further.
- Remember the last time?
- You were stripped of your possessions!
Because of that I added four more eunuchs to the population.
Allah be with you.
All the paradise I seek is here.
Who wants anything more?
I shall stay behind.
All silent, no sound, no lights...
A city of ghosts.
- Why is the gate closed?
- Curfew is not until midnight.
No sentries about.
Ho there! Captain of the watch!
Open the gate!
- Wake, wake, wake, wake!
- It's Sinbad, friend of caliph Kassim!
And a better friend to the Princess Farah!
- Captain Sinbad.
- You know me?
I am a merchant. I hope to purchase some of the cargo you'll unload tomorrow.
No one is admitted to Charak after sunset.
- But why?
- The plague. Many have died.
Every time we reach this port some misfortune strikes us!
- The caliph Kassim and his sister?
- They're well. But he's not caliph yet.
I was told in Jerash that
Kassim's father died three months ago.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
- We'd better return to the ship.
- Yes, let's sell our cargo elsewhere.
I'm not leaving Charak until I see Princess Farah and Kassim.
- Is there another way into the town?
- No.
But if you wish to take the risk you may enter at daybreak.
Until then I can offer to relieve your disappointment.
My tent has wine, food and music.
My people are your servants.
Please, be welcome.
Come.
Hassan, don't drink!
The wine is poisoned. Help Aboo-Seer.
Who are you?
Why have you tried to poison us?
From the depths of the earth,
I command you: Arise!
Destroy them!
Kill Sinbad!
Everyone back to the ship!
Captain Sinbad! ...Wait.
Princess Farah!
Quickly.
Praise to Allah that I found you.
I must talk to you.
Not here, not now.
And no going back that way.
Come with me.
Keep rowing back to the ship!
Keep rowing, keep rowing!
Make for the open sea!
- Hoist the mainsail... do it!
- But the shoals, Captain.
We will risk them, there is a full moon.
We'll lie offshore and not return until daybreak.
- You will go back?
- At dawn.
Warm yourself.
Here, take this.
Drink this.
You were searching for me. Why?
I was told of your return.
I need help desperately.
- My brother is in great danger.
- Prince Kassim? I owe him my life.
A spell has been cast upon him.
My uncle Balsora will tell you.
- Why not you?
- I beg of you, do not leave Charak!
- Trust me for my brother's sake.
- For him I would risk my life.
For you... I would give it.
- I was told there was plague.
- Not true.
Balsora rules the city by day... but by night fear rules Charak.
- People whisper of witchcraft.
- How can I help?
- You will find a way.
- Come... lie down.
- I prayed every day for your return.
- It's been almost a year.
- I was not willing to give up the sea.
- Nor I my life at court.
- Now I've decided to live on land.
- And I to live at sea.
I have returned to Charak to ask Kassim for your hand. Will you consent?
Willingly.
But only when my brother is able to stand before you and give his consent.
- When he is himself again.
- Himself?
After my father's death,
Allah protect his soul...
The astrologers had decided that the first full moon would be auspicious -
- for the coronation of my brother.
On the day of the ceremony, the procession began, -
- but even as the crown was being placed upon his head...
Lie back.
It was the last time I saw him as the Kassim I've known all my life.
Young, handsome... a true prince.
You talked of a spell...
- Or has he fallen victim to the plague?
- Worse than a thousand plagues!
Do not talk of it now.
Hassan, where is the Captain?
- What is it?
- His Excellency is here!
The Vizier Balsora.
Ask the princess to come on deck.
- Excellency.
- Captain... welcome again to Charak.
There she is... may Allah's name be exalted.
I prayed that Princess Farah might reach you safely last night.
- Has she told you?
- Yes, this morning.
But is it true, Excellency?
Let's go on board.
My beloved child.
Praise be to Allah you are safe.
Hassan, food and drink for our guests.
The rest of you, back to work.
- You have told him of our misfortune.
- But is it true, Excellency?
Tragically, horribly.
We have consulted all the wisest men and skilled doctors.
- They can do nothing.
- Come. Sit down.
You have travelled to many lands, help us.
- Perhaps there is someone somewhere.
- I will do all in my power to help.
But this requires skills far greater than mine.
It needs an understanding of the black arts, a great alchemist, a magician.
Wait... Yes, I have heard of such a man, if he still lives.
- Who?
- A Greek.
Some say the wisest man in the world.
His name is...
- Hassan, you remember.
- Melanthius! The hermit of...
- Maroof?
- Casgar.
A remote haunted island.
- Have you been there?
- No.
His deeds are legendary, but he may not even exist.
The island is ringed with deadly reefs.
- You must take us to him.
- It would be dangerous.
I cannot allow you to go.
Unless Prince Kassim is crowned before the passing of seven moons, -
- he will lose forever his right to be caliph.
- Melanthius is our only hope.
- Some say he's mad.
The island savages eat human flesh and worship him.
I will send treasure.
Gold and precious jewels for you, your crew and Melanthius, -
- if only he can restore my nephew.
Should I undertake this voyage, it would not be for gold or jewels, -
- but for a treasure far more precious.
Oh, my beloved son.
May Allah preserve you.
Keep those horses steady!
- Who is that?
- Zenobia, my stepmother. She hates me!
- She was not at court.
- My mother died when I was born.
It is said Zenobia is a witch and willed her death.
Allah protect us! Why is she here?
Be on your guard, Sinbad, she's more dangerous than a scorpion!
Queen, may Allah's blessings be on thee.
We meet at last, Captain.
What brings you back?
To deliver my cargo... and to visit my friend Kassim.
- And his sister?
- I am bound by love to them both.
I intend to ask the caliph Kassim for the hand of Princess Farah.
There's no caliph to consent to your marriage.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
Nor is he likely to be.
I have been told of the events at the coronation.
I shall help if I can.
Kassim is beyond help.
Do not be blinded by love.
Balsora must be made to understand no one can help him.
- I shall tell him.
- Do not provoke her!
Why do you interfere?
You can do nothing for Kassim.
- Captain Sinbad can help us.
- I implore you, be silent.
What can you do -
- when they've consulted all the wise men, doctors, priests, astrologers?
- There may be another.
- No one! Abandon this false hope.
- Kassim is doomed forever.
- You lie. You want him doomed.
Within the passing of seven moons, if Kassim is not crowned caliph, -
- he will lose his right forever.
You bewitched him.
You want your son Rafi to be caliph!
Let me cut the smile from her face!
Let me go!
You'll bring an eternal curse on us -
- if you draw one drop of blood from any member of the royal family.
It's only for that she hasn't murdered Kassim!
As cunning as a snake, as malicious as a shark. Rafi will never be caliph!
- There is no one to prevent it.
- Melanthius will prevent it.
Melanthius is a myth and his powers are a legend. He does not exist.
We shall soon discover if the myth and the legend exist. We sail tonight.
My beloved, may your days always be blessed.
Sail for Rhodes or Tripoli, you'll find richer cargo there.
Set sail in search for Melanthius and you'll set a course for damnation!
Aboo-seer, Hassan, Bahadin.
Prepare the ship for sea.
Order your men to bring treasure for Melanthius.
We sail for Casgar.
One thing I advise...
Set a careful watch on Zenobia.
I will have my men watch her castle by day and by night.
Zabid will be in command.
He's the best soldier I have.
My son, Sinbad has agreed to help them. We must act quickly.
He has taken them to the Isle of Casgar to consult the great sage Melanthius.
- Is the heart ready?
- Yes.
You said no one can help Kassim.
Exquisite, my son.
If Melanthius truly lives, he is the one person who could.
You promised me. I am to be caliph. You swore Kassim would never inherit Charak!
- I shall prevent it.
- How?
Sinbad has a ship, a crew.
Balsora has the palace guards.
We shall have other forces at our command.
More powerful than a palace guard and a lovesick sea Captain and his crew.
That... will be our army.
Quickly as you can.
We must be away before nightfall.
- Take that box in my cabin.
- Carefully, I implore you!
It's a baboon!
What a beautiful specimen.
Get back to work or I'll make baboons of you!
Does he do any tricks, Princess?
There, there...
They mean no harm.
O brave and proud bull -
- whose mighty heart my son has fashioned of purest gold.
Beat... with the power as only I command you.
I made it perfect in every detail.
O mighty Abu Salem... you who rule over a thousand devils, -
- by all the fires of hell and darkness, -
- give strength and life to this your creature.
Minaton... Minaton...
Perfect!
A colossus of bronze... and mine to command.
- Hear anything?
- Nothing.
Keep awake! Orders are to keep a watch on Zenobia's castle.
Or I'll slit your throat.
The wind is dying.
A baboon that can play chess?
Go away!
- He's frightened of you.
- I'm frightened of him.
He attacked me.
Baboons can turn savage, you know.
He is not savage!
I command you to go away.
Is he a gift for the wise man of Casgar to play chess with?
Go away!
Hassan, get back to your work.
- But Captain, the beast was playing...
- ...chess, he has beaten me twice.
He is not really a baboon.
He was transformed by the black arts of Queen Zenobia's witchcraft.
He is... Prince Kassim.
Can you be certain that it is not the princess -
- who has been bewitched to believe this animal is a prince?
He is my brother.
Look!
I am Kassim.
Now do you believe?
What is it?
What could it be?
A ship that moves without sails!
He seems to be rowing for six men.
Come on, let's try to get aboard.
Hurry, it's moving out to sea.
A fishing boat.
Spies of Balsora!
Minaton...
Wheel head into them.
It's Zenobia!
For the love of Allah, row!
Row, will you!
Row, you thickheads, row!
It's witchcraft!
- Save yourselves!
- Ram them, I said. Ram them!
Mercy! Save me!
Minaton... Minaton.
Wait... wait!
And now for Casgar.
North by north-east.
I see nothing.
Breaker ahead!
The rocks and the reefs will be invisible.
It'll be impossible to land.
- I have an excellent idea.
- Yes?
Let's turn back.
- Lower the rowing boat.
- Aye aye, Captain.
Hassan, keep up!
Stay close together, move!
Rest.
How can you be sure where to find Melanthius?
This is a path.
There are tracks. Signs.
Forward, men!
There!
A great pillar.
- Must be a holy place.
- Built by a people of great skill.
- What can it be?
- A temple perhaps.
It seems to be carved out of solid rock.
Could be there is treasure in it.
Could be the castle of Melanthius!
Melanthius! Melanthius!
I will see if anyone is there.
- They'll kill us!
- Run for the wall!
They will not harm you now.
Have you been shipwrecked?
No, my ship is anchored safely.
I am Captain Sinbad.
Only those who were wrecked have landed here before.
But the Casgar people always found them first.
We seek the wise man known as Melanthius.
Does he truly exist?
- Does he live on this island?
- Why do you seek him?
It is a matter of great urgency and importance.
Go!
Go, I said!
This is Princess Farah from the distant city of Charak.
I am Dione.
- Come.
- But Melanthius... does he exist?
Follow me.
Truly incredible!
A magnificent city.
But completely deserted.
Who built it all?
- The ancestors of the natives.
- What happened to them?
They became too civilised and destroyed each other.
Is that where the savages live?
Those are the tombs of their forefathers.
- And those buildings to the right?
- Tombs of kings.
There is someone there.
Is that the great Melanthius?
Yes, father... I will.
Melanthius will see you.
- How did you?
- My father taught me.
He calls it "telepathia". A Greek word for communication of the mind.
Come, follow me.
- Master Melanthius.
- You're a brave man, Captain Sinbad.
And a remarkable navigator to have landed on Casgar safely.
Only for that have I agreed to see you.
Well, thank you... but I still don't understand how you know who I am.
The mind is an extraordinary thing.
Thought is transferable.
It can travel through space, even to the stars.
But the method needs time, patience and a skilful daughter.
What have you got in there?
Tell me.
- It's a cage holding...
- Wait! Don't tell me.
It's an arboreal anthropoid of the genus papio.
- No, it's a baboon!
- That's what I said, a baboon.
- What a dear little fellow.
- Careful!
He can be savage with everyone but the princess.
As a species they are aggressive and of low intelligence.
- He trusts only me.
- He looks so unhappy, poor creature.
Careful!
- It is the baboon about whom...
...you wish to see me. Yes, I know.
I suggest we continue below in my laboratory, out of the sun.
You claim it can write and play chess?
It, my brother, was a brilliant chess player from the age of seven.
Dione, fetch me a mirror.
As a scientist and alchemist
I know that metals can be transformed, -
- but as a philosopher...
Easy, fellow, easy.
I can also believe in the possibility of
...metaphysical change.
Thank you, Dione.
Let him see his face.
Go on!
He's weeping.
By all the gods!
A true baboon would have attacked its reflection, thinking it an enemy.
It would not have recognised itself and been moved to grief.
I am very happy to meet you,
Prince Kassim.
The oars...
Rafi, what has happened?
The oars are smashed.
It will take hours to repair. Quickly!
Sinbad found a way through.
Whatever drug or elixir it was that this woman...
Zenobia.
Whatever it was she used is the most powerful black magic -
- and is beyond my knowledge.
You see, unfortunately, time is on her side.
Perhaps the prince would like some of these.
Real apes are mostly vegetarian.
- How does he like his fruit?
- He does. He likes them.
I thought he would.
- Dione, where is the mint tea?
- Coming, father.
I brought him something.
Bananas... he likes those.
I'll serve the tea.
What did you mean when you said that time was on the side of Queen Zenobia?
The longer that transformation is delayed, the more likely -
- Kassim is to lose those human qualities that remain to him.
Then there is no hope for my brother?
Now, wait...
There was a time when men knew how to combat this form of black witchcraft.
A nation with an intelligence far superior to anything we know today.
They knew the secret of transforming matter.
Dione, help me find the Arimaspi scrolls.
The Arimaspi?
Yes, Archimedes of Syracuse, a very dear friend of mine.
He based many of his inventions on principles originally developed -
- by Arimaspi mathematicians.
Here they are!
Invaluable manuscripts... Where are they?
I've found them.
Yes, these are the ones.
Clear the table.
These scrolls are more than two thousand years old.
- There we are.
- What do they say?
This first one... will be of special interest to you, Captain.
It's sailing directions.
The first written authority.
The only way to restore Kassim is to undertake a journey to their country?
A journey to Hyperborea, the land of the Arimaspi, -
- is the only possible way of restoring Prince Kassim.
These scrolls confirm the legend.
It tells of a warm and green valley at the northernmost point of the world -
- surrounded by wide seas of ice.
There in the valley of Hyperborea, the Arimaspi built a shrine.
The shrine of the four elements:
Earth, fire, air and water.
Within that shrine is the source of all their extraordinary power.
This power enabled them to preserve their valley against the glacier -
- and to change or transform the nature of matter.
I have been experimenting with a similar power.
- Is there truly such a valley?
- Beyond a doubt.
Then how soon can you be ready to sail?
The journey would be impossible!
It's the coldest region in the world!
Cold, certainly. Difficult and dangerous, perhaps, but not impossible.
We have you to interpret the scrolls.
I'm too old!
Besides there's so little time.
Come with us, Melanthius.
It can't be this noble prince shall spend the rest of his days in a cage.
The shrine is his one chance. You're the only one that can lead us there!
Please, say you will.
- Where did you find that?
- With the scrolls.
The key! The only means of opening the door to the shrine.
Hyperborea... to visit the shrine, examine the very source of life.
Archimedes would split himself with envy.
Now, everyone, stand well back!
Imagine that power a million times greater used not for evil, but for good.
That is what the Arimaspi have left us!
Yes, I will go with you.
- Thank you!
- Yes, by all the gods, I will.
No way of reading the sun.
Cloud and fog.
Hurry, hurry!
Listen!
They are leaving!
Hurry! We must follow them.
With a following wind to drive us, we should be many leagues into the...
And into the Western Ocean before the next full moon.
- Why not sooner?
- Not possible.
Time is our enemy on all counts!
At the moment Kassim is still in possession of certain human qualities.
The longer the transformation is delayed, -
- the more he'll revert to a baboon's natural behaviour.
More aggressive, savage, dangerous.
He may never be Kassim again.
We are under full sail.
I can do no more.
It is believed that there is a swift ocean current due north -
- across the Casgars.
North! They're moving north towards the Celtic Isles, but why?
We should be close to Sinbad's ship.
Keep a lookout.
I must know what advice the Greek gave them.
I must know what they mean to do.
I can't!
It was powerful enough to transform Kassim.
I must know.
Now... by Hecate -
- and all the secrets of darkness and forces of hell.
Come!
Captain Sinbad!
Is there no way of increasing our speed?
A ship can only sail as fast as the wind allows.
I'll have to consult the chart again...
Now the moon is on the wane.
No, no, no...
If you study my design, -
- you'll see there's more curve in the runners. The snow will be deep.
But I have never seen snow, Master.
Here, let me try it.
I shall join you in a few minutes.
Maroof, the chart!
Here, sharpen this.
Bahadin, more ropeties for the sledges.
The cargo nets will need to be prepared.
Everything as strong, but as light as possible.
Hassan, I told you to get that knife sharpened!
No, you must try.
You can do better, you know you can.
No, Kassim, not like that.
The other way around.
Like that.
Very well, as you're so bad-tempered, no more writing today.
Baboon!
Kassim, be quiet.
Your friend is very disobedient today.
- Please, Kassim, I'm trying to work!
- Will you be still!
Father, why is he behaving like that?
Be careful.
In the cage, in it!
Well, well, well. And what by Zeus and all the gods have we got here?
- And who?
- Zenobia.
I thought as much.
- But how?
- Never mind how.
Be careful.
Remember she's a witch, and dangerous.
Put me down! Let me go!
Don't hold me!
Don't hold me!
How dare you!
Captain... the glass jar there on the shelf.
It's like trying to hold on to a scorpion. Dione, clear the table.
Captain, put the jar down over there.
Make a space.
- No wonder Kassim was so violent.
- You should have left her to him.
No, Princess, no.
I want to interrogate her.
I suggest that whatever power she has used -
- to transport herself here and change her size -
- is similar in power and property to that which transformed Kassim.
But what is it and where is it?
Leave her in my charge.
I will try to extract it from her.
You must take every care.
A confrontation with evil could be dangerous.
Captain, take the princess and Dione up on deck.
Come with me.
Now then, mistress...
What powers have you used to shrink yourself?
- I will never tell you.
- Oh dear.
I despise brutality, -
- but at this present moment
I'm prepared to reject compassion.
The sting of this insect can be fatal to the strongest, -
- but to someone of your size...
Then answer my questions and quickly!
What are you searching for here on this ship?
These perhaps?
Or this?
How could you know of their existence?
When will you decide to return to your proper shape and size? And how?
Something of unique power.
The power that might be used to return
Prince Kassim to his human form -
- and make our journey to the Arimaspi unnecessary.
The Arimaspi!
Where is it? And in what form?
A liquid? A powder?
My locket! ...Gone!
You've dropped it, haven't you?
Now, where would it be?
Kassim... have you seen it?
Here it is.
It's mine, it's mine.
It belongs to me!
It's smashed, the liquid's evaporating.
There's not much left.
- Take care, the liquid is precious.
- Evidently.
I believe it is the very stuff you used to transform Kassim into an animal.
Perhaps there's not enough left to retransform him. I must test it.
- Yes, on our friend here.
- No, that's mine! I need it!
Will he be tempted?
There's a good fellow.
Lap it up, that's the way.
No, no, there's not enough!
Be silent!
By all the gods!
Kill! Kill the Greek!
Get away from me!
Transformed... the locket!
Get back!
- It's a mad bee!
- What is it?
It's not a bee. It's a mosquito!
What a mosquito!
The bird is getting away!
Kill the bird first.
We need the locket.
Praise be to Allah that you're unhurt.
Alas,
I underestimated the power of Zenobia.
I fear I've thrown away a chance for Kassim. I am profoundly sorry.
You were right, Princess.
We should have left her to Kassim.
Try to calm him, Dione.
He's becoming more savage. Best to keep him locked in his cage from now on.
Safe... You are safe.
Is there enough?
Yes, by all the gods of the underworld, there must be!
Not enough! Not enough!
If only I had seen more.
Memorised more, recorded it into my brain.
- A valley.
- At the end of the world.
And here: The shrine of the legends.
The healing shrine.
We must let Sinbad show us the way.
And then I shall find the means to prevent Melanthius from interfering.
Come, help me.
Ahoy!
Ice! Ice ahead!
- Where away?
- Dead ahead. Icebergs!
At last!
- Will it be soon now?
- We must sail north for four more days.
The less distance to cover on foot the better. Anything to gain time.
The fourth full moon.
Two degrees port!
Look at them.
One column of that on top of us and we'd sink like a ship of lead.
The entrance to the tunnel is somewhere there.
If we could enter safely, our journey will be all but over.
Sinbad, there!
Exactly as described in the scrolls.
Hassan, fetch me the chart.
- The tunnel leads directly to the shrine.
- It'll crack the boat like a walnut!
We must take the longer route.
There's less than three moons left.
If only we could've entered the tunnel.
We'll never make headway against this.
It's getting thicker every hour.
The hull must split if we go further.
Maroof... load up the sledge.
Throw up the ropes...
Quickly!
Keep moving, don't stop!
Pull! Keep pulling.
- It's easier to abandon it!
- Keep moving.
The ice is no match for a boat of bronze.
- And Sinbad?
- Perhaps smashed, drowned or frozen.
Bahadin!...
What could it be?
What is it?
Look, it's beginning to crack!
I'll get the others!
On your feet! Seize anything you can!
Spears, axes, anything!
Melanthius, protect Dione and the princess!
A giant walrus! We must stop it before it reaches the camp!
Hit the eye! The eye!
Attack!
Get the cargo net.
Careful, Maroof!
Protect the supplies!
Get the cargo net!
Unravel it. This way. Quickly!
Open it. Spread it out.
Push, go on, push!
He's pulling us!
Pull away from him.
He's pulling us!
Help me.
Cut me loose.
Sinbad, my foot!
Cut me loose.
Hassan, your knife!
Cut me loose, cut me loose!
Too bad you couldn't hold him.
I should've liked to examine him.
- Walrus giganticus, prehistoric!
- I'm sorry. Next time I'll try harder.
Are you hurt?
It is said a man has only one life.
Now I have two.
I owe them both to Captain Sinbad.
I've never seen a black man turn white before.
No sign of a tunnel between the cliffs.
The chart in the scroll is precise.
There is an entrance -
- and I mean to find it.
Minaton, sail on!
We've found it! We've found it!
Look, it's the aurora, see?
Hyperborea just beyond the hills.
And that strange glittering light?
The Arimaspi call it the gift of the winter Apollo.
We call it aurora borealis.
And there, directly below the aurora, -
- the Valley of the Shrine.
He's turning carnivorous.
I hope it is not too late for Kassim.
He no longer responds to human speech or contact.
Except for Dione.
Take them, Maroof.
Protect the women.
Sinbad, stand still!
All of you, don't make any sudden moves.
He's as frightened of us as we are of him.
- I'm more frightened.
- I'm twice more frightened.
Sinbad... lower your sword and step back slowly.
Do it!
What sort of evil monster is it?
It's not a monster.
It's one of man's ancestors.
They're not evil.
They're called troglodytes.
I've got the skull of one of them in my laboratory.
He's coming closer!
Dione... speak to him.
Gently...
They have no idea of language, -
- but these primates were known for their gentleness with females.
There, there...
No harm.
We mean no harm.
Friends.
We are friends.
Dione, be careful!
Kassim, he means no harm.
Perhaps he might be able to help us.
Dione, Princess...
Persuade Kassim to bring the trog over here. I've something to show him.
Bring trog.
Bring him over there.
There... to my father.
Kassim, I want the troglodyte to look at this.
The face drawn on the scrolls!
It marks the entrance to the valley, the gate to the shrine.
Where, where?
Hyperborea!
By all the gods, he's done it!
Hassan, Maroof, the weapons.
There! There it is!
The entrance to the tunnel of ice!
The way to Hyperborea.
We shall be there first!
The tunnel, Minaton.
I will light the torches.
- Farah, are you all right?
- Yes.
There! Look over there!
- The last of the Arimaspi?
- Who can say?
Minaton.
Listen!
The boat is still moving!
There's some extraordinary force pulling us like a mighty magnet, -
- drawing us to the shrine.
The face from the scrolls...
The gate to the shrine.
Come on.
Trog seems frightened of the gate.
- Frightened of what lies beyond, maybe.
- Why should he be afraid?
Like all primitives, he's afraid of the unknown.
Afraid of what he can't understand.
Help me move the bar.
It's no use. We cannot move it without blocks and ropes.
Trog will help us.
He must help.
The shrine of the four elements.
- See, it exists! A reality.
- Hope for Kassim... at last.
The arch!
The boat is stopping.
Wait.
Go on, up into the sunlight.
There it is.
Come!
At last you'll have a use for that precious key of yours, -
- if you can find a lock to fit it.
We'll find it.
The scrolls haven't been wrong yet.
We must look for an opening somewhere there among the rocks.
We must be close.
Hurry, Rafi!
Nothing... nothing.
I could not find an entrance.
We must make an entrance.
Rafi, Minaton, stay clear!
Spirits of the underworld, infuse this potion with your powers!
What was that?
- It's like an earthquake.
- There can only be one possible answer.
The witch.
Zenobia.
- He'll never break through.
- He must! He must!
He must!
Minaton, pull!
He's done it!
He's done his work.
The wall is breached!
- Look there!
- Zenobia's creation.
A bull's head, but a...
...giant's body!
Almighty God, defend us.
They shouldn't have forced an opening.
The power of the shrine is threatened!
The atmosphere inside is destroyed!
This key is useless!
Perhaps there's still time, but we must be swift!
Drawn down from the crown of Apollo itself.
The guardian of the shrine...
The ice is melting.
Look out!
- We must act at once!
- The cage... and the chains!
Just as described in the scrolls.
We must put Kassim in the cage and pass him through the column of light.
Sinbad, the chains!
See if they still operate.
- Thank all the gods.
- The gods have abandoned you!
Too late, Sinbad!
Kassim will never be caliph!
Now, Rafi, now!
Not the animal, kill Melanthius!
They are helpless without him.
Sinbad, bring Kassim.
May the gods of the Arimaspi grant us the time!
Bring him up, bring him up!
O great Apollo! All you gods and forces that work for good against evil, -
- help us now! O great mystery, come to our mortal aid!
Reveal your secret!
Lower the cage!
Your Highness.
Prince Kassim...
This way, Your Highness.
Master Melanthius, he made it all possible.
- How shall I ever thank you?
- It's an old debt repaid.
The power of the shrine is failing! We must go! There's not a moment to lose.
The temperature's changing violently.
Be swift or this'll become our tomb!
Zenobia!
She's gone!
Stand back! Get back!
- Come on, let's go!
- No, not yet.
Now, move! Move!
Take Dione and the princess back to the gate.
- We shall not leave you!
- Do as I say!
If I do not join you within an hour, then head for Charak -
- before the seventh moon is full.
Maroof is dead.
They're coming!
Where's Maroof?
Come on, we must not waste a moment.

Umph!
What a location!
Ah, si. The mighty Coliseum!
The glory of Rome!
Doesn't it stir your imagination?
HAWK: You bet it does, baby!
Do you people realize what a shopping center we could put up there?
Plenty of parking too.
MAN: Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the world's highest office building.
Hawk Plaza...
130 stories of manmade glory!
In just a few hours, Hawk Enterprises will break ground on this incredible project.
How did it happen, you ask? I give you now the man that made it all possible.
Thank you, friends. Thank you.
My heart is too full to speak.
Ah, you see.
You've brought a tear to this flinty, old eye.
So, all I can say is thank you.
Thank you for allowing me to share a moment of your precious time.
Get those deadheads out of here.
What, are they gonna stand around all day and drink my booze?
All right, ladies and gentlemen, down to my office...
-(BUZZING)
-...where a scroll awaits you.
Hello.
SECRETARY: Mr. Barnsdorf, sir.
Hello, Barnsdorf.
When are you going to be ready for us to start digging?
What are you talking about?
That building site's as clean as a...
What's that?
I thought we got rid of that crummy little firehouse months ago!
There's just one holdup. We couldn't get old lady Steinmetz to sign the papers.
Just one, beat-up old lady makes monkeys out of the most overpaid lawyers in the country!
Come on, boys. I expect a little action, and I better get it or else!
For some reason, she doesn't seem to trust us.
Of course she doesn't.
Have you looked at yourselves?
Your own mothers wouldn't trust ya!
What we need is somebody so nauseatingly innocent, and so stomach-turningly helpful and so incredibly dumb anybody would trust him.
-(BUZZING)
- HAWK: What is it?
SECRETARY:
Mr. Willoughby Whitfield to see you.
He says he's your nephew.
Whoever he is, throw him out!
Don't bother me again!
Say, wait a minute.
Is that that dumb-looking kid of my sister's from back east?
He was going to law school or something?
He just finished law school.
He says he's a full-fledged lawyer.
He's a full-fledged lawyer.
Send him in.
Mr. Hawk will see you now.
Oh.
Thank you.
Come in, boy. Come in!
Isn't he beautiful?
Uncle Alonzo, I hereby present you with the first law college
Humanitarian-of-the-Year Award.
Here.
Oh, well, well.
Humanitarian of the Year, eh?
That's right, Uncle.
Award committees give out humanitarian awards to a lot of strange ducks, but why me?
I was the award committee.
You put in the fix!
You figured to take care of your Uncle Alonzo.
You're a smart boy!
If there's one thing I admire, it's somebody who knows how to use juice properly.
Juice?
Yes, juice. How to use muscle, influence, how to bend things his own way.
Oh, no. My goodness, no.
It wasn't done dishonestly.
I thought it over, and I couldn't think of anyone any more deserving than you.
How come?
From the day I was born, my mother never tired of telling me what a great man her brother was, getting rid of dirty old buildings and building shiny new ones, sending us California fruit at Christmas.
You were her idol.
You clowns get out of here.
I'm trying to have a nice talk with my favorite nephew.
HAWK: When I look into your eyes and see the shining light of idealism aglow there, it makes me young again and ready for battle.
Battle?
Yes, battle!
It has never been easy for us idealists.
Now, I'm going to give you a chance to put that idealism into play on your very first job.
Oh.
Picture if you will, a tough, little old lady, living in a rundown, rat-infested firehouse, standing right in the way of our latest civic benefaction.
There may be city builders who might find it in their heart to be vindictive to this old lady.
They might say that she feeds on the misery of the poor in that forsaken neighborhood, that she rolls drunks, that she teaches small children to steal and make them bring most of the take to her.
Would I, Alonzo Hawk,
Humanitarian of the Year, stoop to such tactics?
On the contrary!
I would do everything in my power to help that tough, no-good, little old lady.
I would give her a large sum for that worthless property, and I would provide a special price to her alone a lifetime lease in Eternity Towers, that beautiful new haven for helpless old people such as herself.
It has a gymnasium, a sauna, an old Rudolph Valentino-
Sessue Hayakawa movie.
It has a beauty parlor, hobby center, and instead of cooking her heart out over a hot stove, there would be automatic machines in every hall to lavish her with everything from pizza to hot chili.
Now wouldn't it make just your whole being happy to be part of all that?
When can I start, Uncle?
Here's the address. Get moving.
- Here.
- Thanks, pal.
Ah, isn't it breathtaking?
DRIVER: It's a mess, all right.
That guy, Hawk, oughta be hung.
What?
WOMAN: I'm coming.
Mrs. Steinmetz? Good morning.
My name is Willoughby Whitfield.
I'd like to discuss business with you.
Come in, won't you?
I can't.
You see this car has rolled onto my foot.
Oh, dear!
I guess somebody forgot to set the brake or something.
Herbie, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Get off of Mr. Whitfield's foot.
Herbie's always trying to protect me.
Herbie?
I'm quite capable of taking care of myself.
I was about to make a nice cup of tea.
Come in. You must have one with me.
Oh, thank you.
Of course, I have to humor Herbie.
He used to be a famous racing car, but his driver went to Europe to drive foreign cars, so he's a little sensitive.
You can understand that.
Yes. Now, to get down to business, Mrs. Steinmetz.
People have been worrying about you living in this old firetrap.
I've been asked to come over and...
Firehouse, not firetrap.
Firehouse, yes. Be that as it may, the least we can do...
Stop that! That's downright rude!
Do you know what he was playing?
Do Not Trust Him, Gentle Maiden.
Nothing personal.
- No.
- He's a friend of Herbie's, of course.
Friend of Herbie's?
So is old 22.
You may as well meet all the family while you're here.
Number 22 used to be on the old Clay Street line.
Herbie found him in a vacant lot.
Someone had used him as a chicken house.
He's much happier here, of course.
I can understand that you may have some emotional attachment to this old building...
Indeed, I have.
I was married here to my late husband,
Captain Steinmetz, of the San Francisco Fire Department.
- Oh?
- One of the heroes of the great fire.
We understand your position.
That's why Mr. Hawk has authorized...
Don't tell me you're from Alonzo Hawk?
Yes.
Oh, you have such a nice face.
Thank you.
Not at all like those ruffians he usually sends.
If you would just look at the size of this check.
I don't know anything about money.
My nephew, Tennessee Steinmetz, usually takes care of me.
He used to live here.
He had to rush off to Tibet because his guru got sick.
If you would just look at this...
What's a guru?
His teacher! My nephew is a student of Oriental Philosophy.
That's how he learned that things have an inner life.
Like wind, rain, traffic lights, can openers, flowers...
And little cars.
That's how Herbie and Tennessee became such great friends.
Mrs. Steinmetz, this sum of money could take care of you for the rest of your life.
I didn't have to study Oriental
Philosophy the way Tennessee did.
I could talk to Herbie right off.
Oh?
I guess it's in the blood.
See ya tomorrow!
WILLOUGHBY: I don't like to press, but believe me,
Mr. Hawk has your interest at heart.
I have an agreement here.
If you would just glance...
Oh, Nicole!
I want you to meet a gentleman from Mr. Hawk's.
- How do you do?
- Agh!
Poor Mr. Whitfield!
Such a nice young man.
They're bothering us again?
You've hurt your hand.
On the contrary, it feels marvelous.
Are you all right, Mr. Whitfield?
What was that?
Nicole Harris, a very brave young lady.
She works for the airline.
Last week she knocked out a hijacker with a bottle of California wine.
Now, get out. If you or any more of Hawk's stooges come around, you'll get worse than that.
Please. Mr. Whitfield and I were having a nice conversation.
I'll bet. But...
Isn't it time for your nap?
Mr. Whitfield is just going.
Well, very well. Good-bye, Mr. Whitfield.
I hope I'll see you again when I come down.
Mrs. Steinmetz...
- Out! Out!
- What?
Please, have a heart. This is my first assignment. I can't afford to fail.
I said, out!
All right, all right.
Miss, you look like a sensible person.
You must know living all alone in this crummy neighborhood is no place for an elderly woman.
What do you mean "alone"?
She's got me...
And she's got Herbie.
That's another thing.
That goofy story about this car, that's a sure sign she's coming apart.
So you think it's goofy?
Of course, don't you?
How would you like to go for a little ride?
I thought you didn't like me?
I'd like to take you for a ride in Herbie.
I'd like that very much.
That's very nice of you.
I'll be ready in a minute.
All right, Herbie. Let's get going.
Miss Harris, you're obviously an intelligent young woman.
Why do you pretend to talk to this car?
People might wonder.
Don't listen to him, Herbie. Just move it.
I can understand Mrs. Steinmetz thinking of this car as a person.
Old age has many fantasies. It only proves that she needs Mr. Hawk's help.
Remember, Alonzo Hawk sent him.
You and I know better, don't we?
You stubborn bucket of bolts!
You always have to do everything your way.
Let's stop kidding ourselves.
This is just an ordinary little car, like a million other ordinary, rather unattractive... Whoa!
I don't think you should have said that.
Herbie's very sensitive about his appearance.
All right, you've had your laugh.
You ought to stop now.
You won't get Herbie to stop until you say you're sorry.
The thing that upsets me most about this thing is you trying to maintain the fiction about this... Whoa!
Please, tell Herbie you're sorry.
All right!
Herbie, I'm sorry.
What do you think now?
I think you're a skillful driver, but I don't know if I'd like to have you drive me again.
You think it's a trick?
Yes. I would say the whole thing is a trick.
Would you like to drive?
Yes.
Good.
There, you see, this car is just your ordinary, rather stupid-looking... Whoa!
What do I do now?
It's too late now. You're on your own.
I just hope Herbie hasn't lost his sense of humor.
WILLOUGHBY:
"Chicken tournament jousting today."
What? What's it up to now?
I don't know.
It's hard to figure Herbie out sometimes.
ANNOUNCER:
The gallant and chivalrous contenders
are now taking their places on the field of honor.
At the north end of the list,
the undefeated champion of the tournament,
earless, brutal, unforgiving,
the Red Knight!
Yeah!
At the south end, his stouthearted adversary,
the ever-popular Sir Lancelot!
I don't know what Herbie's up to, but I hope it's not what I think it is.
ANNOUNCER: Let the joust begin!
Give the signal, Your Majesty.
What are they doing?
Seems dangerous to me.
Hey, what are they doing?
I think this is where I get out.
Good idea. I'll join you.
ANNOUNCER: The victor, thus far, has demolished all who oppose him.
The surviving champion, your favorite and mine,
the Red Knight.
At the other end,
we have a mysterious new contender,
but the name doesn't matter.
No one lasts for long against the Red Knight.
- Let the joust begin!
-(REVVING)
No, Herbie! Wait!
I take everything back.
I apologize. I believe, Herbie!
I believe!
My brave champion, you have won me!
Take me to your kingdom.
You win the bread, man. $3.
Uh, I'm beginning to think that I owe you an apology.
Oh, no, I can't stand men who apologize.
Oh, uh, well, may I take you to lunch?
All right.
I used to live in a little apartment building opposite the firehouse.
I loved it. Then Alonzo Hawk came along to tear the place down.
And kicked me out.
I'm sure he didn't mean it personally.
Now you know why I go crazy every time
I hear the name Hawk. How's your jaw?
It's all right. It's... Ooh.
I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know it was your first assignment?
You couldn't possibly know what a no-good he is.
Miss, there's something
I should tell you...
Anyway, Mrs. Steinmetz took me in until I could find another place to live.
When I found out what Hawk was up to,
I stayed on to protect her.
I wasn't gonna let rats from Alonzo Hawk talk her out of her home.
I don't think you're being quite fair.
Fair? To Alonzo Hawk?
Yes.
Don't tell me he's conned you the way he's conned everybody else.
I think I should tell you that...
Did you know...
He put a parking garage on the lot where the DiMaggios learned to play baseball?
Please, I...
His factories are polluting all the fish in the Bay.
Look,you...
His skyscraper casts a cold, gray shadow on the children's playground all day long.
Let me tell you...
He kicked 30 old-time Chinese families off Grand Avenue to make room for his skyscraper.
Please, Miss Harris.
I can't believe Uncle Alonzo would do things like that.
Wait a minute! Uncle!
He's your uncle?
Yes...
You rotten spy!
Here's your warm milk, Grandma.
Be sure and drink it.
You know how good it is for you.
Yes, dear. I still can't understand why you hit him with a boiled lobster.
Grandma, I wish I could stop doing things like that.
I really sort of like him.
I'm glad to hear that.
After all, brilliant, eligible lawyers don't grow on trees.
What are you leading up to?
Um, nothing, dear.
I just thought that perhaps you could talk things over with that nice Mr. Whitfield.
Nice try, Grandma.
But if I want a young man,
I'll have to get him my way.
I suppose so, dear.
Stop hatching plots and go to sleep.
Yes, dear.
Good night, Grandma.
Good night, dear.
NICOLE: Good night, Herbie.
Pleasant dreams.
MRS. STEINMETZ:
He used to be a famous racing car.
He used to be a famous racing car.
He used to be a famous racing car.
Uncle Alonzo,
I dropped by to talk to you man-to-man, so I could look you squarely in the eye.
No, I'm wearing makeup because of a black eye.
A girl hit me in the face with a boiled lobster the moment I mentioned your name.
This same wonderful, intelligent, clearsighted girl was able to convince me what kind of a person you really are.
I do not hold with your scheme of cheating Mrs. Steinmetz out of her home so that you may build your concrete anthill on the spot where she has known so much happiness.
Hmm.
I think you are despicable, greedy, grasping and wholly without principle or pity.
I also believe you are not a nice person.
If you write my mother, who is also your sister, Frieda, please do not tell her that I wear makeup as a general rule.
I'm going back to Missouri now, so you may no longer use me as a cat's paw.
I bid you farewell, more in sorrow than in anger.
Please do not send us any more fruit for Christmas.
Good-bye, Grandma.
NICOLE: Hi, everybody!
Hi, Herb.
No hard feelings, okay?
I'm so glad you and Herbie decided to make up.
Oh.
I'm just going for my morning walk.
Come with me.
We could have a nice chat.
I just came to say good-bye.
I'm going home to Hawk City, Missouri.
Oh, what a pity!
Nicole was hoping to see you again.
She's a wonderful girl, even though you don't seem to agree with her.
I do agree with her now.
As a matter of fact,
I'm going straight to my uncle to tell him exactly what I think of him.
That's splendid!
He might be an important man but it's time somebody told him the real truth.
Nicole will be thrilled.
Please wait 'til she comes back.
To be honest, I'm more afraid of her than I am of my uncle.
Nonsense! Nicole is just a high-spirited young lady.
Oh, that's for sure.
Good-bye, Mrs. Steinmetz.
Don't weaken about the firehouse.
Don't you worry.
Call my nephew wherever he's staying and tell him to get right over here.
Yes, sir. And Mr. Barnsdorf is on the phone for you.
Yeah, what do you want?
You ready for us to dig yet?
My boys are gettin' itchy.
I'll tell you when to start digging.
Thought I'd remind you I got some high-priced digging equipment and crew sittin' around playin' gin rummy, waitin' for you to make up your mind.
It's costing you 80 grand a day.
Stop bugging me, Barnsdorf.
I'll give you the order to start digging any moment now.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawk. I called the motel but your nephew checked out.
What do you mean he's checked out?
When? Where?
Who told him he could check out?
How dare he disappear when he knows I'm worried sick.
I'll tear his chicken-Iivered gizzard to pieces.
I'll stomp him silly!
I'll take this letter knife and I'll stab that kid in his ungrateful breastbone.
You know me, Millicent.
Normally I'm a kindly fellow.
But when I get crossed, I go bananas.
Yes? Oh.
It's your nephew.
Willoughby?
Where are you?
Oh, hi, Uncle.
I thought I'd save time and phone you the news.
That's marvelous, great!
You're a smart boy!
That Hawk blood will tell in the end.
All ashore that's going ashore.
What's all that noise?
And what news?
The news I was leaving town.
Leaving town?
Uh, I'm on the ship-to-shore phone...
From the deck of the Swedish freighter, the Gustav Gustaffson, bound for Helsinki.
(GASPING) Helsinki!
I'm glad you're taking it like this, Uncle.
You know, you really should leave Mrs. Steinmetz alone.
Haaa!
Don't worry. You'll feel better in the morning.
Stop talking like an idiot.
I feel better right now.
Alonzo Hawk may be betrayed, but he is never defeated!
Outta my Way!
Since none of you pitiful excuses for men have enough muscle to move a feeble old lady off her property,
I'll go and do it myself, like I have to do everything around here that's important.
- Now, Mr. Hawk.
- Oh, shut up!
We'll start on number one, harassment.
And I wrote the book on harassment.
We'll shut off her phone, turn off her water.
We'll sic the health and building inspectors on her.
Steal her dog.
She doesn't have a dog.
What do you mean? A little old lady living in a place like that?
Who looks out for her?
How does she get around?
She has a little car she goes everywhere in.
You fellows go and pick it up!
Yes, Mr. Hawk.
A bunch of lamebrains. Hold it, hold it!
You fellows'll probably even foul up on a simple assignment like this.
The first team is on the job.
I'll go pick the car up myself.
Overeducated pinheads!
All right, gentlemen, start taking notes.
Learn how the grownups do it.
You gentlemen are probably unaware of it, but I began my fabulous career as a repossessor of motorcars.
At the tender age of 19,
I was the best-known repossessor of cars west of the Mississippi.
Hot-wire Hawk, they called me.
Observe, gentlemen.
Screwdriver, pliers and a piece of wire.
Check your watches, and you will see that I will return with the object of my mission in 15 minutes or less.
All right, let's go.
Madam is not at home, sir.
Thank you, Maxwell.
I won't be needing you anymore.
Very well, sir.
Once you learn something when you're young, you just never forget it.
Except a six-year-old kid could steal this one-cylinder hair dryer.
Quiet!
All right, buddy, let's get this thing outta here before I...
Oh, hello, Mr. Hawk.
What are you doing in this little car?
Just shut up and push!
Certainly, Mr. Hawk.
One tiny thing, is the car out of gear?
Of course it's out of gear, you nitwit! Just push!
All right, Mr. Hawk.
Okay, push.
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you gonna do about that cab?
Are we trying to get tough?
Don't you dare to threaten me.
All right, Mr. Hawk.
Well?
Three minutes to go.
Oh, hello, Commissioner.
Got a little problem.
We gotta tow him outta here.
Mr. Hawk, just sit quietly this time.
Don't touch the pedals or the gears, understood?
Don't order me around.
I will do as I please!
The traffic commissioner shall hear about this!
I am the commissioner.
Then what are you doing in that monkey suit?
The traffic commissioner would dress in dignified clothes.
This happens to be my dress uniform.
I was on my way to the ceremonies for "I am a Policeman" day.
Okay, let's go.
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Commissioner, call your office.
There's been an accident.
See the man. See the man.
One minute to go. He'll never make it.
Oh, if Mr. Hawk says he'll do something, he'll...
Here he is!
Get that car, dead or alive!
Right away, sir!
Mr. Hawk?
If you'll sign a few of these citations.
Compliments of the commissioner.
Well, he's got more stuff than I thought.
Yeah, I'm sorry he's going too.
All right, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Flight 38 for Las Vegas...
I tell you, Mother, you've never seen Uncle Alonzo in such a rage!
He's probably having this airport watched right now.
But he won't find me.
I'm wearing a disguise. A disguise...
A beard and a mustache.
Yes, I know, Mother. I promised I wouldn't grow a beard when I left.
Don't you understand? It isn't real.
No, I will not go back and apologize to Uncle Alonzo!
He is a greedy, unscrupulous, no-good, thieving, uh, uh, uh, coyote. Yes, thank you, miss. Oh!
No, Mother, my asthma is not coming back.
No, nothing's the matter with me.
Everything is just fine now.
This is the turning point of my life.
Uncle Alonzo used to push me around and you were always telling me what to do.
Then I met this perfectly wonderful girl.
I was even afraid of her 'til now.
I've just decided something.
I am not going to be a rabbit anymore!
Good-bye, Mother.
- Ooh.
- Ooh!
Come along, Herbie. Off to market.
Thank you, Herbie.
Let me see now.
Half a dozen tomatoes.
Um, the broccoli looked very nice yesterday.
What else was there?
We've sighted the car, Mr. Hawk.
We're moving in for the kill now.
They're moving in for the kill now.
Ooh!
What happened?
You said you were moving in for the kill!
Negative.
A little premature, I'm afraid, sir.
She's obviously a very desperate woman.
But don't worry.
She won't make it this time.
Another of your shortcuts, Herbie?
Where is she now?
She's still going up and up.
It's incredible!
She's driving like a madman.
Oh, Herbie, behave yourself.
You knocked my glasses off.
Where on Earth is she?
Don't answer it. It'll be Hawk.
Look!
No, Mr. Hawk, the phone didn't ring before.
Were you trying to reach us?
Did you grab the car?
Any moment now.
There it goes, into the Sheraton-Palace Hotel.
The Sheraton-Palace Hotel?
May I draw your attention to the superb baby shrimp?
All right, Herbie, but you'll never convince me this is a shortcut to Vern's Market.
Gentlemen, do you have a reservation?
There it is!
MAN: After her. Somebody stop her.
Don't let her get away.
Come on, let's go!
There's only one thing gives me the creeps, that's that weird little car...
What's the matter with you?
There it is!
Pull yourself together.
You're getting hysterical.
Take two aspirins and lie down.
One of us has to keep our nerve.
Come on, come on! Move it!
(CHUCKLING) Now we've got him.
Stop woolgathering, Herbie.
We really must get to the market.
Oh, oh! Wait a minute.
Look out! He's coming back!
Ooh!
Look out! Look out!
Grandma, I was worried about you.
Is everything all right?
Wonderful! Herbie took me for a nice drive on the bridge.
Let me help you.
It's Mr. Whitfield.
So nice to see you again.
This morning you were on your way to Missouri.
Nicole spoke to me.
Grandma, Mr. Whitfield's agreed to help us fight his uncle.
Wonderful! Stay for dinner.
I've already invited him.
Why don't you take those out to the kitchen?
Yeah. Thank you.
What a fine young man!
You look so right together.
Oh!
Now, if there's anything I can do...
There is one thing, Grandma.
Just let nature take its course.
Oh, yes, dear.
Oh, I wouldn't want to interfere, not for anything.
Oh.
By the way, we're going to want more broccoli for dinner.
Will you and Willoughby pick me up some, please?
Sure.
Incidentally, you ought to drive down to the beach.
Grandma!
It's the most beautiful day.
We'll just go get some broccoli.
Yes, dear, of course.
I'm not gonna say another word, Herbie.
There's nothing I can do.
Of course, I can't help it if you happen to have a mind of your own.
Can I?
I guess I should have told Mrs. Steinmetz I don't like broccoli.
Herbie, where are you going?
The young lady and gentleman have turned towards the north.
It would appear that they're not immediately returning to the firehouse.
See that they don't.
Do anything you have to, but don't let them return to that firehouse until after dark.
Do you read me?
Perfectly, sir.
Oh, Grandma put him up to this.
Where's he taking us?
I don't know, but I could make a guess.
Pardon me, sir.
Is this the only road from the beach?
Yep!
Would you care, sir, to earn $50?
Don't mind.
We wish you to obstruct the road from the beach for two hours.
My employer is preparing a surprise party...
Don't explain.
Just give me the money.
It's very romantic here, don't you think?
Do you know that's the first time I've ever heard anyone use the word "romantic" in a real conversation?
I hope I wasn't being too forward, but it is romantic.
I think that's what Grandma had in mind.
She always thought the Pacific Ocean was very romantic.
Captain Steinmetz proposed to her on the beach near the Cliff House 50 years ago.
I'm sorry I punched you the first time I met you.
That's okay.
It wasn't very ladylike to hit you with a boiled lobster.
It's okay.
You can hit me back if you want.
That isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Oh!
Herbie! Oh!
Oh, it's time we were getting back.
Herbie, come on!
Leave that sea gull alone!
Herbie!
I wish that car would learn to mind.
Herbie, please!
Herbie!
Heel, Herbie!
See? Just needs a firm hand.
You know, Willoughby, sometimes you really surprise me.
Hey, what's happening?
Sorry, sir. My rear axle's frozen.
But, how're we...
Sorry.
WILLOUGHBY: No, Herbie!
Ooh!
Whoa!
Oh.
Ahh.
Oh!
Ahh!
Oh, well, here we are.
Ah.
Nicole?
Very quietly and quickly, pull your hand back inside the car.
Why?
We've got company.
Hmm? (GASPS)
NICOLE: That's ridiculous! Why would a shark follow a Volkswagen?
WILLOUGHBY:
Because he thinks the same thing I do.
We're going to sink.
WILLOUGHBY: Uh, excuse me.
Can you tell me the way to San Francisco?
Yeah, man. Straight up the beach road, first left, second right.
Thank you.
Whoa...
Old number 22, it's gone!
What?
They came with a big truck.
Everything's gone.
Who did it?
It said on the truck,
"Alonzo Hawk Van & Storage."
Haven't you ever jimmied a lock before?
Of course not.
It isn't a hobby of mine.
Hurry. We can't just stand here.
(ENGINE REVVING,
TIRES SCREECHING)
Good for Herbie!
HAWK ON RECORDING: Halt!
You have been detected by electronic surveillance.
You are about to be surrounded
by agents of the Alonzo Hawk Security Service.
Touch nothing in this warehouse
or you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Don't you dare talk to me like that, Mr. Hawk!
I want my things back and I'm going to have them!
I think that's a recording.
I don't care what it is.
Halt! You have been...
Let's find your things before somebody gets here.
...by agents of the Alonzo Hawk Security Service.
Touch nothing in this warehouse
or you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Your things aren't here.
Maybe we better...
GUARD: All right, hold it!
Okay, get your hands up.
MRS. STEINMETZ: Don't you get fresh with me, young man.
Watch it, Smitty. She's the ring leader.
SMITTY: Come on, grandma. Move it!
Keep your hands up.
MRS. STEINMETZ:
I most certainly will not.
If you say please, I might consider it.
All right, please.
There now, you see, that wasn't so difficult after all.
If you'd mind your manners, life would be easier for all of us.
Now, would you be good enough to tell me exactly what you are doing with my furniture?
GUARD: How do we know, lady?
All I can tell you is that nothing goes out without Mr. Hawk's okay.
Look out, Smitty! Run!
There goes some more.
Out of the way!
Hey, we're out off!
How're we gonna get out of here?
You know, Smitty, I don't think
Mr. Hawk's gonna be happy about this.
(GRUNTING) Whew!
Oh, evenin', mother.
Eh, ain't you a might old to be a stewardess?
There've been a lot of changes since I come to visit this town.
Barnsdorf, will you stop worrying about your digging equipment?
You're paying me 80 grand a day.
Will you stop bothering me?
I have broken the old lady's spirit. Yeah!
I've taken every stick of furniture.
She's sitting in an empty firehouse, ready to listen to reason.
Barnsdorf, I guarantee you you can start digging first thing Monday morning.
Yeah.
What?
That's right, sir.
Yes, they got away with everything.
Call out every unit of the mobile security force!
We'll nail 'em to the wall!
Stop at the top so we can figure out how to get down the other side.
Right.
Uh, like I was sayin', little lady,
I was doin' fine 'til I got into that sheep-dip you call liquor in this town.
My name is Judson.
Got a little cow ranch a couple hundred miles north of here.
Been alone with those cows for over 40 years, so I thought
I'd get into town and stir up a little excitement.
Might be my last opportunity.
I better get a piece of rope and tie us all up together, nice and snug.
Oh, no! It looks like Uncle Alonzo!
No, Herbie! Don't do it!
Oooh!
After him!
Faster! Faster!
Oh, Herbie, now you have got us in a mess!
Now, Herbie, stop this minute!
VENDOR: Hey, watch out.
What are you tryin' to do!
You busted my machine!
Look, here comes another one.
That's not nice. Look what you've done to my "pretzellette"!
Mrs. Steinmetz!
Mrs. Steinmetz, put on the brake!
You're a fine lookin' woman.
Did you say you was married?
No, the Captain's been gone these many years.
There he is, Captain Steinmetz, hook and ladder, number 27, city of San Francisco, a fine gentleman.
Nice picture.
You carry it around with you everywhere?
Mrs. Steinmetz, use the hand brake!
- Oh! You okay?
-(GROANING) Yeah.
I declare, little lady, you're a sight to make this country boy's heart flutter.
Oh, don't be silly. I'm much too old.
Oh-oh-ho. The way I figure it, you're just about comin' into your prime.
Can't that thing play somethin' with a little more pep?
How nice to see people dressing up for parties again.
Was that anyone we know?
Looks like these cars go a lot faster than when I was a young fella.
Well, you can't stop progress!
- Look at that!
-(GASP)
Herbie, you gotta help us!
Steady, Herbie!
Come on! Come on! Move closer!
Hurry up! We're running out of street.
Closer! A little more!
Go On, Jump!
Whoa. (GROANING)
(GRUNTING) Oh!
Hmm, well, here's where I get off.
Thanks for the ride, little lady.
Appreciate it.
Sure like to cross trails with ya again sometime.
Are you all right, Grandma?
Of course.
I just met the most interesting man.
Good morning, Grandma.
Sleep well after being up so late?
Not a wink, my dear. I suddenly realized what an enormous amount of trouble Alonzo Hawk is giving me.
I'm going straight down to his office to give him a piece of my mind.
- Oh, no, you don't.
-(HONKING)
Oh, I have to go. Bye-bye, Grandma.
Please, don't do anything foolish.
Willoughby, I know Grandma and I think she's up to something.
Don't worry, I'll keep her out of mischief.
You better or else I'll get tough again.
Bye.
Bye.
Uh, where are you going,
Mrs. Steinmetz?
To see Mr. Hawk.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
You heard what Nicole said.
Nicole is a very sweet girl. But at her age she shouldn't start ordering me around.
Do you mind if I go with you?
That won't be necessary.
- No, but I think Nicole would prefer it.
-(ENGINE STARTING)
Hey, come back!
Mrs. Steinmetz! Come back!
This certainly is a nasty whiplash,
Mr. Hawk.
I'm afraid you're trying to do too much.
I know, Millicent.
But except for you, who can I depend on?
I have to do every...
Who are those clowns?
Your new lawyers.
You fired the others yesterday.
Oh, now look, fellas, I'm gonna tear down the Steinmetz firehouse.
Just a moment.
You have the necessary permit?
Of course I don't have a permit!
I don't even own the land yet!
Sorry, Mr. Hawk, such an action would jeopardize the legal status of your new building.
We can't permit you...
Will you get outta here?
I didn't hire you to tell me what I can't do!
I hired ya to tell me how I can do it!
Go!
You see, everybody lets me down.
You know me, Millicent.
I'm enthusiastic, boyishly eager.
All I get is cheap lawyer talk.
Poor Mr. Hawk. It isn't fair.
Nevertheless, I shall not falter.
I am like a sensitive, finely-tuned violin.
All I need to restore me is a few moments of peace and quiet.
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, you out there!
Hey!
Hey, turn it off!
You idiot!
What do you think you're doing?
Washin' the windows, every Wednesday, Mr. Hawk's orders.
I am Mr. Hawk. Get out of here!
Okay, cancel the windows.
And you better shut the window!
Runs up the air conditioning bill.
You're fired, get your money...
Mr. Hawk's orders!
They may harass me, but don't let them ever think they have me beaten.
That is when Alonzo Hawk is at his most dangerous.
Yes, sir.
(CHUCKLING) Millicent.
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to try and get
Fred Loostgarten on the phone for me.
He used to work with our wrecking company before I fired him.
I understand he has a little one-horse operation of his own now.
Yes, I think that's how Captain
Steinmetz would handle the situation.
Excuse me, could you tell me where Mr. Hawk's office is?
Yes, ma'am, the old buzzard hangs out
28 stories up, six windows to the left.
You can't miss it.
I'm sorry. I don't hear so good from this side.
28th floor! You can't miss it!
Thank you so much.
No! Mrs. Steinmetz! Stop!
Mrs. Steinmetz! Come back! Stop!
Mrs. Steinmetz!
(STAMMERS) Help!
Grandma! Mrs. Steinmetz!
(GRUNTING) Help!
Help!
Missus... Grandma!
Help! Mrs. Steinmetz!
Grandma! Help!
Mrs. Steinmetz! Help!
Grandma!
Is that you, Mr. Whitfield?
Where are you?
Down here!
Help me!
Oh, there you are.
Just a minute. I'm coming.
No, no, stay where you are.
Just take us down.
Of course, Mr. Whitfield.
But first you must promise to let me see Mr. Hawk.
Anything! I'll do anything you say!
Very well, Mr. Whitfield.
Hey, Loostgarten, old buddy, how are ya?
I know things haven't been going too well for ya, but that's the way life is.
Yeah, right, Mr. Hawk.
I got to thinking...
I've got to find a job for my old friend, and here it is.
You know that crummy old firehouse on the site where
I'm building Hawk's Plaza?
Yeah?
I want you to get your wrecking ball and smash it.
I want nothing left but itsy-bitsy splinters.
Don't worry, Willoughby.
I shall be perfectly polite... But firm.
What do you mean,
"send you over a permit"?
I don't get one 'til tomorrow morning.
Yeah, but, Mr. Hawk, I...
Loostgarten!
The job has gotta be done tonight!
Take it or leave it! (HANGS UP)
Millicent, my dear, will you put a check in the mail to Loostgarten?
That's Loostgarten Wrecking Company, uh, a thousand on account.
Tonight he's gonna smash that crummy firehouse to matchwood.
That'll teach that old battle ax a lesson.
No, no, Grandma, he won't like that.
MRS. STEINMETZ:
I don't care what he doesn't like!
Knock down my home, will he?
Oh, no! Uncle Alonzo, I don't believe you've met Mrs. Steinmetz.
How do you do?
Don't worry, Uncle.
Everything's under control!
Yeah, just dandy!
Now you've done it, Mr. Hawk!
You've made Herbie very angry!
HAWK: No! No! Get out!
Get out! Get out!
No! No! No! Go away!
No! Herbie! Stop!
Ooh! Wrong way!
Stay away from me!
Somebody come in here and stop this thing!
Don't you think we ought to see what all those noises are?
When Mr. Hawk says he doesn't want to be disturbed, that's it.
Herbie.
Uncle?
Now's a good time to explain. Uh...
You! (SPUTTERING)
Help!
Herbie, stop it!
Will you be going out for a while, Mr. Hawk?
Herbie!
Gotta get away from that thing.
- Good morning, Miss Millicent.
- Good morning.
Mrs. Steinmetz?
I told you Mr. Hawk was busy.
Aw, shut up! And get off my building!
There must be some way to make this car behave.
I don't like to threaten Herbie.
He has been trying to help us.
But there's one thing Herbie is afraid of.
Whoa!
Now stop, Herbie.
Don't make me do it.
Please, do it, Grandma.
Very well, Herbie.
It so happens that I know this nice used car lot.
I'd certainly hate to call Mr. Honest Al, the used car man.
(QUIETLY) Of course, you know I never would do it.
And between you and me, I don't think
Herbie believes I would either.
But it always works.
(SIGHING) What a lovely morning.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Did we get the name of the gentleman who thinks he's going to knock down my firehouse?
Hmm. It was Loostgarten, of the Loostgarten Wrecking Company.
I'm going to write that down.
We're going to need it.
Well, thanks anyway for trying Millie. Bye.
Millie's one of the stews who works for Hawk's airline.
She can't find his address either.
May I say something?
No, I'm still mad at you for not taking care of Grandma.
If we can't find out where he lives, my idea won't work.
NICOLE: We'll just have to think of something else.
WILLOUGHBY:
I am going to say something.
I've sent Uncle Alonzo a card every Christmas since I was seven years old, and here's his address.
Willoughby, oh! You're wonderful!
Right.
Loostgarten speaking.
This is Alonzo Hawk.
Right, Mr. Hawk.
Loostgarten, there's been a slight change of plan.
I don't want you to knock down that firehouse tonight.
Instead I want you to knock down
343 Oleander Heights.
You got that?
343 Oleander Heights!
Right.
Write it down!
I don't want to see you blackballed in the wrecking ball business,
If you get what I mean! (CHUCKLING)
You were wonderful!
Oh!
Yes... I know it's 3:00 in the morning, but I can't sleep.
Well, you're my doctor, aren't ya?
Sometimes the old-fashioned remedies seem to work best, Mr. Hawk.
Have you ever tried counting sheep?
Sheep!
Picture in your mind's eye a grassy green meadow, a whitewashed, three-rail fence, a flock of sweet little sheep.
They begin to jump over the fence. One sheep...
Six sheep, seven sheep, eight sheep, nine sheep, ten... (SNORING)
Yeah, what is it?
Sorry to disturb ya at this time of night, Mr. Hawk.
But a guy in my job can't afford to make mistakes.
What are you talking about?
That address you gave me on the phone.
What about it?
343 Oleander Heights.
Are you sure that's the right address?
Of course I'm sure, you idiot.
I know it as well as I know my own address.
Wait a minute.
It is my own address!
Loostgarten!
No! Not this! This is my house!
You dumb jerk!
Loostgarten!
This time you're really through. Help!
You...
MRS. STEINMETZ: We beat him!
I knew he'd cave in.
He just couldn't stand the heat.
Hello? Oh, good morning, Mr. Hawk.
Well, now that it's all over,
I just had to phone you and tell you how much I admire the plucky fight you put up for that sweet little firehouse.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Hawk.
Well, what brought about my change of heart was an accident to my own little house.
It only brought home to me how terrible it is to lose something you really love.
What happened, Mr. Hawk?
Well, a very confused man came along
and knocked down the whole side of it,
smashed it to rubble. (CHUCKLING)
Someone knocked down
Mr. Hawk's house.
Aw, what a rotten shame.
HAWK'. But it...
It did serve a purpose.
It made me realize I can't knock down any more of San Francisco's beautiful old buildings.
So I don't want you to worry that sweet, little, gray head of yours about it.
Is that clear?
Yes, Mr. Hawk. Thank you, Mr. Hawk.
All right, Mrs. Steinmetz, and I'll drop by one of these days and have a cup of tea with you.
Bye.
I always said you'd do the finer thing, Mr. Hawk.
What are you talking about, fathead?
Giving up Hawk Plaza.
Are you fooled by this phony story?
But, Mr. Hawk, you can't go back on this.
Oh yes, I can!
I can say I was misquoted!
I can say they printed the story purposefully to discredit me in the eyes of the public.
Well, it's an old gag!
It's out of my bag of tricks.
You mean we're still going after the old lady?
Right for the jugular vein, baby, right for the old jugular.
I wish Grandma would hurry up and get here.
Can't start a celebration party without her.
It gives us a chance to have a quiet talk.
We never had one before.
Something always happened.
Uh, oh, thank you.
Nicole, there's something
I've been wanting to say.
What's that, Willoughby?
Did I ever tell you that my great-grandfather Whitfield was one of the first men to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel?
Oh, well, was he all right afterward?
I don't know. They never found him.
I think I'll Call Grandma.
The giant lobster is very good tonight, sir.
Of course, no lobster.
I did mean to call, dear. But I was just sitting here thinking to myself what a fine time those two young people must be having without me in the way.
Now listen, Grandma,
I love you very much, but I've had enough of your matchmaking.
Now you get over here like you promised.
If I do marry Willoughby, I'd like the satisfaction of nailing him myself.
Do go ahead without me, dear. I think I'll just have a quiet evening at home.
(YAWNING) Good-bye, dear.
Now, do go on with your wonderful story about the cows, Mr. Judson.
I swear I never seen a handsome woman like yourself who had so much an interest in cows.
That's quite natural, Mr. Judson.
After all, a cow is not only useful, but an extremely decorative animal.
Ain't it just!
As I was saying, I got this nice little 200-acre spread up in Oregon.
What in tarnation you doin' that for?
I'm not quite sure.
I think I saw this once in a movie.
Oh, no!
Just let me get my hands on the brute responsible for this.
Now. Horse whipping's too good for him.
What on Earth?
It's Mr. Hawk!
Herbie! Don't you dare!
Oh! Every man for himself!
Herbie must have gone for help.
Hope he makes it through to the fort.
We must be cut off.
Okay, Steinmetz!
We know you're in there.
We've got you surrounded.
We'll give you 10 minutes to get your stuff together and get out
before I grind this dump to powder!
Now you hold on there, Mister!
This little lady's under my personal protection and she stays here!
Ten minutes, Steinmetz!
Uh, to get back to my great-grandfather at Niagara Falls,
I don't think I put it quite right.
What I wanted to say was, though we Whitfield men look like rabbits, we have always liked challenge, the scent of danger in our nostrils, the high road to adventure.
Yes, Willoughby?
That's why I want to go on seeing you.
Not to deprecate your physical attributes, certainly, but because there is this feeling of danger about you, of something about to happen.
NICOLE: You're right, Willoughby!
Looks like we've just picked up a friend.
HAWK: Three minutes to go, Steinmetz!
This is your last chance!
JUDSON: Make your play, Hawk.
We're standin' pat.
I think Captain Steinmetz would have liked you, Mr. Judson.
You're his kind of man.
Thank you, ma'am.
Hey!
HAWK: Attention! One minute to zero!
Gentlemen, start your engines.
Here come the hostiles.
We're ready for 'em.
I think Captain Steinmetz would have liked you to wear this.
Why, I'd be proud to, little lady.
Mighty proud.
Power shovel number one, ready?
Ready, Mr. Hawk.
Full speed ahead! Go!
Fire.
Hey. Hey!
Stop! Help!
Cease fire!
Good shooting, Mr. Judson.
Thank you. That one won't bother us for a while.
Hurry! Move in with the crawler!
All right, Mr. Hawk!
Fire!
Please, stop it! No!
(LAUGHING) Ceasefire.
There goes another one.
We got the devils on the run. Fire!
(GROANING) Oh, no!
Are you all right?
Don't worry about me, ma'am.
What we gotta worry about, we're plumb outta ammunition.
This time we all go in together!
We got nothin' to regret, little lady.
We done our best.
Ready!
Drive! Drive!
Let's get goin'! Get outta here!
Hi, Grandma! Hi, there!
Why, that rascal!
She's got a man with her.
No wonder she wouldn't come to our party.
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Wait a minute! Back!
Why don't ya look where you're goin'?
How dare you raise your voice to me, you myopic oaf.
Hey! What do you think you're... Whoa!
All right, Herbie. That's enough now.
You think you're gonna make him stop?
Fat chance.
Herbie, if you don't stop, you won't be invited to the wedding.
Ah, it's you again, Mr. Hawk.
Save me! Save me!
They're after me! They're after me!
Who's after you?
Those little cars... Hundreds of 'em!
Can't you see them, you idiot?
Mr. Hawk, I wonder, would you mind coming down to my place of business?
I would be happy to.
I would... Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!
And what happened then?
Willoughby told Herbie that if he didn't stop, he wouldn't be invited to the wedding.
Wait a minute. What wedding?
(WEDDING MARCH PLAYING)

Look, I found it!
15 years ago, - a giant gorilla was seen in small town at the Himalayas.
The villagers lived in peace for years.
Except the earthquake during that year.
If we'll find the gorilla - and sent it to Hong Kong - we will be rich and famous.
The animal is long and very strong.
It's not easy to catch.
But it's still animal.
With our intelligence  - we can win it.
And even if we don't catch it alive, we can use it for experiments.
And we'll get lots of money.
- That's right.
I know scientist named Chen Zhengfeng.
Also he want's to find the gorilla.
He's been down after he broke up with his girlfriend.
Zhengfeng...
Have you already decided after our conversation, - will you lead our expedition?
Have you thought about it?
- All right.
I'll come with you.
Let's go to look.
Let's go.
Zhengfeng.
Come here.
I'll introduce them.
Good day.
These are Mr. Chen and Mr. Lin.
Expedition team has 6 members.
Welcome.
And we hope that you find that gorilla soon.
Keep in touch.
Look.
What's going on?
Let's help at pushing!
Hurry up.
Let's continue.
We haven't seen anyone - during last days.
We have long journey still ahead.
Strange!
Why the village is abandoned?
Is anyone here?!
Elefants are coming this way!
Elefants.
Hurry, run!
They have gone already.
Get up.
Let's move on.
Let's go.
Zhengfeng, you have been quiet - since you came here.
Are you all right?
We are at the same boat.
And we are close friends.
What's wrong with you?
Tell us.
And we'll see if we can help.
It's not a big deal.
Is it about your girlfriend?
I know you broke up.
I have 2 intimate friends in Hong Kong.
One is my ex-girlfriend.
She loves singing, and other one is my brother.
He's TV-producer.
He's a real businessman.
He wants to be famous some day.
We had everything fine, - but one day when I came home -
I catched my brother and her together.
Zhengfeng.
You two.
Why? Why he?
I didn't anticipated.
I didn't know that you two...
I really didn't know.
Please believe me, I really didn't know.
Zhengfeng.
After that - you decided to lead the expedition, right?
Forget the whole thing.
There are lots of nice girls.
After we have catched the gorilla, - you'll be world famous.
You'll have many women.
Let's got to sleep, tomorrow is a long day.
It's quicksand!
Don't shoot!
Why not?
Are you okay?
Get the medikit.
Hurry.
Hurry up.
Was that necessary?
Why did you kill him?
Let go of me.
There wasn't reason to save him.
We don't have enough medicine.
I don't wat to waste anything.
- You...
That's enough,
I have had enough already.
Let's go back to Hong Kong.
There is no giant gorilla.
We got screwed!
Calm down.
I'm convinced, that we'll find that gorilla.
We have come so far already.
We can't afford to return, right?
No.
Let's go.
Straight forward.
This track looks fresh!
I believe it's not far from here.
Let's leave it die alone.
Where is everyone?
Stop it.
Wahng, don't hurt me.
Go.
Drink. Drink all.
You are...
Who are you?
I'm Chen Zhengfeng.
I'm looking for giant gorilla.
Don't worry, it's only scratch.
Who are you?
Why you are here?
I...
Where are your parents?
Mon and dad.
They are...
Where are they?
Nearby...
Can you take me to them?
Okay.
Wait a sec.
This way.
Come.
Follow me.
Look.
Dad, mom and me.
Look.
Downpour... aeroplane... accident.
I see, the gorilla has raised you - all these years, right?
Your name is Ah Wei?
Ah Wei... yes.
If you're hungry, let's eat something.
Where's the food?
Follow me.
Jiji.
Good boy.
Go.
Come here.
Let's go.
I'm thirsty.
This is good.
It hurts.
Thank you.
Mister Lu Tien.
Hi.
I'm reporter from the Daily News.
Please sit down.
About your expedition.
How did it go?
We explored all forest.
There is no giant gorilla.
It's probably just a legend.
I heard, that Chen Zhengfeng is still looking for.
Is it so?
Chen Zhengfeng...
He won't survive alone at the jungle.
He's become animal food.
Ah Wei, are you ok?
Ah Wang.
Ah Wei.
I want to take you and Ah Wang - to Hong Kong tomorrow.
We're going on cargo ship.
He listens only you.
What do you think?
Say "yes".
Yes.
Bye.
Jiji.
Come.
Bye, Jiji.
Stop.
Lay down and sleep.
I've been looking for you.
- So have I.
I found giant gorilla and brought it with me.
Let's go look it.
Excellent.
We'll look for biggest cargo ship - and transport it to Hong Kong.
No chains, please.
Let it go, please.
Don't worry, listen.
Gorilla is huge - and strong.
If it'll fly off the handle - and broke its chains, - it'll turn over ship.
It has to be chained.
Don't cry, please.
Zhengfeng,
Ah Wang got chained!
Ah Wang is too strong.
It has to be chained.
We'll release it at Hong Kong.
Come on.
Zhengfeng.
Don't cry, Ah Wei.
I have present for you.
Open it.
We are back in civilization.
You can't wear your costume anymore.
Wear this.
Try it.
Try.
Mister Lu, outrageous!
You should have knocked!
Excuse me,
I have news for you.
I got telegraph from Hong Kong.
Everything is ready.
Giant gorilla will be introduced - at Hong Kong stadium, day after tomorrow.
Tickets got sold out in 3 hours.
Isn't that great news?
Think about, we could take the gorilla - to world tour.
We will be rich.
I don't approve, that we'll - finacially exploit the gorilla.
Zhengfeng, don't forget, - that you signed contract.
You can't violate it.
Besides, contract says, - you'll get 5% of net profits.
I't lot of cash.
Drink with me.
Let's celebrate.
Come.
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.
Gorilla has brought you good luck.
You'll be rich.
Thank you.
Gentle men, champagne.
Enjoy your stay.
I offer.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Captain.
Here's weather report.
Thank you.
What's wrong, captain?
I just got message.
We'll end up to storm within 5 hours.
It's fierce.
I'm going to go through Singapore.
We well sail to Hong Kong - after storm has ended.
Singapore?
Definitely not.
I've already organized show to Hong Kong.
It's day after tomorrow.
All tickets have been sold.
Who will take responsibility over my losses?
ANd what if we shipwreck, - who's then on responsibility?
I'll take the responsibility.
Ship will be fine.
We have to get to Hong Kong on time.
I'll take all the responsibility.
We made a deal, Captain.
If we don't arrive to Hong Kong on time, - your company will make up for my losses.
Is that ok?
Ok, then to Hong Kong.
Ah Wei.
- Zhengfeng.
Ship has drifted to reef, what do we do?
I know.
I'll reverse.
Think up something soon.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wei, come here.
It is dangerous!
Come back, fast!
Ah Wang, push the ship loose!
Harder!
Mom, look.
Giant gorilla is here.
Come look.
That is Connaught Centre,
Hong Kong's tallest building.
You came back, friend?
Are you still mad at me?
You have caused quite headlines!
Totally unbelievable!
It was hard year - living in jungle.
How's it going?
Busy?
Yes.
I'm on show today.
If you have some time, come visit.
Let's see at studio.
I will.
You can meet my brother.
Taxi.
I'm looking for producer Chen Shiyua.
Wait a sec.
Zhengfeng.
You're back.
Like always!
His name is Ah Wei, from indian jungle.
My brother.
Producer, lightning is ready.
We can start.
Ok, take them to studio.
And after the show - we can talk.
Ok.
Mr. Chen,
Miss Wang wants to see you.
Thank you.
It won't take a long.
How are you?
Sit down, please.
It's been while since last time.
I don't know how to address you.
Are you now like my sister?
Please stop.
You...
I was wrong.
My arrogance blinded me then.
I was inappropriate.
I hurted you and me then.
I'm really sorry about it.
Let's not talk about past.
Waht does my brother...
What does he mean to you?
It's over between us.
My brother is still playboy.
I'll talk with him later.
It's not necessary.
Everything is over.
I suffered and felt guilty last year.
That if you had difficulties in the jungle.
I would not have ever forgiven myself.
I prayed for you every day.
Hoping that you would return in one piece.
And there you are.
Will you forgive me?
Do not dwell on it anymore.
Cheer up.
Let's have fresh start.
I'll make it up for you.
Ah Wei.
Zhengfeng.
I'll explain later.
I want to go to Hong Kong Stadium.
Can you take me?
Yes.
Thank you.
You are too proud of.
Because you do not listen to us.
Customers were not satisfied.
We got to trouble because of you, you deserve this.
Stop it.
Ah Wang.
Stop, please.
Move.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang, let's return to the jungle.
Ah Wei, don't cry.
Come with me.
Ah Wang.
Come.
Take a drink.
The giant gorilla has escaped.
Hurry and send your men.
Come.
Ah Wang...
Ah Wang.
Hurry up.
Stay where you are.
Follow me inside.
What's wrong?
Awful, there's a giant gorilla outdoors.
My wife is a gorilla.
What? Who is a gorilla ?
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang, stop!
Don't do it.
Greetings.
Mister.
I know about the giant gorilla.
I will try to lure it to
Wanchai construction site.
It is less populated area.
I'll come quickly to there.
I'm there.
Attention, all units, we need to lure the gorilla - to Wanchai construction site.
Send an armored vehicle unit and wait for my order.
Make checkpoints to largest intersections. Try to stop it.
Shoot the gorilla.
Yes.
Everybody on it.
Okay.
I have a way to control it.
What way?
Girl named Ah Wei.
Gorilla raised her.
If only we can find her, we can control the gorilla.
Where is this Ah Wei now?
- She has escaped.
He is from jungle and dressed in animal skin.
She is easy to find.
- On animal skin!
You were cooperative.
We'll find her together.
Attention, all units.
We are looking for a girl who is wearing an animal skin.
Her name is Ah Wei.
There she is!
Take her down.
They didn't control the gorilla.
We need helicopters.
Focus your all units,
I need all the help.
Blow the gorilla.
Follow it and make sure - you won't hurt citizens.
Everyone to their places.
Fire.
It must be obtained.
Attention, everyone.
It climbs to Connaught Centre.
Bullets don't stop it.
Fill in the roof water tanks with gasoline - and lay bombs.
We will blow it.
The building will be destroyed too.
Doesn't matter.
It is the only option.
Fill the tanks.
- Yes, sir.
Nö.
Don't.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wang.
What now?
Come.
Don't shoot!
Gorilla is crazy.
If we don't kill it, it will destroy Hong Kong.
This is Ah Wei.
Gorilla raised her.
She gets it to calm down.
Really?
I pray for you, do not harm it.
One condition.
Promise me you won't kill it.
I promise.
Are you sure?
I'll keep my word.
Stop shooting.
Stop the shooting now.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang, lower your hands.
Ah Wang.
Let's go back to the jungle.
Ah Wang.
Attention, all units, gorilla has calmed down.
Now is your change.
It must be killed.
We have to.
Yes, sir.
Stop it.
Well done.
It must be killed.
No!
Hurry up!
Explosives unit is ready.
Place the bombs.
And wait for my order.
Yes, sir.
You are setting bombs.
Commander promised me - you wouldn't hurt the gorilla, when it is under control.
We do only our work.
Speak to Commander.
Do not move!
It is useless to defuse.
Tanks are filled with gasoline - and there are bombs everywhere.
It'll explode soon and the gorilla dies.
Shoot it, kill it.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wei.
Let's go, the whole place will explode soon.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang.
Go away.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wang...
Ah Wei, go.
Go down, soon.
Ah Wei.
Oh, god!
It was a brilliant lecture, doctor.
Yeah. the best of the year.
Careful, all these bravos will go to an old Ph.D.'s head.
And now, if you'll take the Necronomicon and return it to the library,
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
Doctor, don't forget we're picking you up for dinner.
I'll be there.
And you take good care of that book.
You know, some of that stuff he said sort of got to me.
It's ridiculous.
No, no. I know what you mean.
Especially those creepy people and some of the things they did.
Can you lift that?
Could I see that before you put it away?
Do you always sneak up on people like that?
Oh, my, you scare easily.
I'd really like to glance through that book, the Necronomicon.
Well, that's impossible.
I've traveled a long way.
The library is closing.
Come on.
Give me 5 minutes.
Absolutely not!
Wait a minute.
I don't suppose it would do any harm.
Are you crazy?
Uh, why don't you take it in there?
Thank you.
You must be insane.
Oh, it'll be all right.
He'll take care of it.
He'll take care of it?
That book is priceless.
Oh, stop worrying about the book.
Did you notice his eyes?
He's really got great eyes.
Nancy, what do you do?
You're giving his rarest book to the first kook that comes along.
Well, uh...
I... I trust him.
"Yog-Sothoth...
"it is the gate whereby the spheres meet.
"only Them from Beyond can make it multiply and work.
"Yog-Sothoth is the key.
"and with the gate open, the Old Ones shall be...
"past, present, future... all are one.
"the Old Ones walk serene and primal...
"undimensioned and unseen...
"the Old Ones broke through of old...
"and they shall break through..."
The book, please.
The book, please.
Oh, there's no need to be upset.
I was only reading it.
Have you any idea what this volume is worth?
It's one of a kind.
Of course, a generation ago, there was another copy...
40 miles from here.
Young man, I am familiar with Dunwich.
I know.
You've read my paper on Oliver Whateley?
He was a great man.
They hanged him.
They were fools.
Who's to say?
I'm Wilbur Whateley,
Oliver's great-grandson.
Then you know who I am.
Dr. Henry Armitage.
Yes. It's a pleasure to meet a Whateley.
Thank you.
Doctor?
Oh, it's easy to see why you 2 girls were so effectively charmed.
I'm very glad to have met this young man.
We share a mutual interest.
In fact, I'd like to talk further with you.
We might learn a great deal from each other, don't you think?
About Dunwich, perhaps?
Dunwich, dr. Armitage, might appear to you as just another small town.
The people of Dunwich are just like everyone else.
They're just more honest about it.
You see man as a rather dismal creature.
Yes. Why not?
Look around.
You'll see what's there.
Fear, and frightened people who kill what they can't understand.
It's late.
I should be going.
Dr. Armitage,
I'd like permission to study the Necronomicon.
For what reason, mr. Whateley?
Well, I'm a student of the occult.
And that book is like a bible.
A rather odious comparison.
Uh, no, not really.
It's not enough to say the book is irreplaceable?
No. You're afraid.
Afraid? Possibly.
In ancient times, that book was said to unlock the gates to another dimension, to another race of beings.
I do not share those beliefs, nor do I fully understand them.
However, I know enough about strange things not to laugh at them.
I don't have to tell you
I'd take good care of it.
I'm sorry,
I couldn't possibly let the book out of my hands.
I need it in my own field of study.
Dr. Armitage, will you lend me the book?
I will not.
That's your last word?
Yes.
Let me get part of that.
Oh, nonsense.
Nancy's car is here.
I'll take you to the hotel.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Mr. Whateley.
Maybe we'll meet again.
Perhaps.
I guess I kind of put the damper on a nice evening, but I can't stand pomposity.
I think you've made your point quite clear.
Do you know how much longer he's gonna be in town?
Uh, his last lecture's next Monday.
Monday.
That's only 3 days.
I wanted to hear one of his lectures.
You won't be here that long?
No. I have to go back to Dunwich tonight.
As a matter of fact,
I should get moving, or I'll miss my bus.
What time's your bus?
You just missed it.
Dammit.
There isn't another bus until tomorrow morning.
Well, uh,
I could drive you.
Oh, it's too late.
I couldn't let you do that.
No, no, really.
I mean, I'd like to.
Oh, fine.
It's only a couple more miles, Nancy.
I hope so. We're almost out of gas.
Oh, saved.
It's past closing time.
Oh, couldn't I have a little gas?
Ok. how much? can you fill it up, please?
Service with a smile.
Say, how far is the town?
Oh, it's down that way.
But we turn off right up here.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to see Dunwich.
It's all right.
There's not much to see at night.
Besides, everything in town closes up pretty early.
$1? I asked you to fill it up.
Aren't you gonna finish the window?
Boy, I could never get used to treatment like that.
They've treated me that way since the day
I was born.
They never change.
They're still the same frightened, superstitious fools.
That's even crazier than you said.
Would you like to come in and see the inside?
Oh, no, no.
I'd like to, but really,
I should start back.
Just have a drink... or cup of tea.
I really shouldn't.
Please.
Ok.
Well?
What do you think?
Well, I don't know what to think.
I'm glad you find it interesting.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Please.
Fine.
It's been a long ride.
If you feel like freshening up, there's a bathroom right through that door.
Thank you.
Wilbur!
Wilbur!
This is my grandfather.
I want to speak to you.
We were just going to have some tea.
I'll see you when we're finished.
I'll be waiting for you.
Sorry.
Sit down, Nancy.
I thought you lived alone.
Gee, I'm sorry he frightened you.
Do you want sugar or cream?
No, thank you.
Tell you the truth, I didn't think he'd be up this late.
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that he startled me.
Wilbur, when you were in the kitchen,
I heard strange sounds.
Oh? what kind of sounds?
I'm not sure.
I mean, it sounded like wind... or the ocean.
That's what it was.
This place is so old.
When the wind blows, everything kind of creaks.
Oh, Wilbur,
I'm sorry.
I dropped something before.
Oh?
The... glass.
Oh.
That's nothing.
It's all right.
Well...
I guess I'd better start back.
Finish your tea.
No, really, no.
It's late. I must go.
I understand.
Well, you come back and visit soon, will you?
We'll see each other again.
What's wrong?
Hell, I don't know.
I wish I could help, but I don't know much about cars.
I don't think this thing's gonna start.
Maybe we ought to phone a garage.
You wouldn't believe it, but I don't have a telephone.
Well, that's great. now what am I gonna do?
I don't know.
You-you know, this is really a good idea.
I'm completely wiped out.
I... I don't even think I could drive if I had to.
I'm sure you'll feel better in the morning.
Oh, yes. yes.
I'm sorry about this room, but it hasn't been used for years and years.
Oh, no, no. don't apologize. it's fine, fine.
Uh... let's see.
Here's a nightgown you can put on if you like.
Thank you.
Wilbur...
Good night.
Good night.
Who is she?
Just a girl.
She gave me a ride home.
Does anyone know she's out here?
No.
Suppose she goes up there?
She won't.
She has no reason to.
She didn't come home last night.
She must've driven that boy home.
I could see she was attracted to him, but I don't think going out there was such a good idea.
Well, didn't you try to telephone?
I couldn't get a listing.
Oh.
It's not like her not to have called me.
Now, if he were a straight guy,
I wouldn't be worried.
I can't remember much more, except it was the weirdest dream I've ever had.
Sounds kind of sexual to me.
Ok, dr. Freud, tell me what it all means.
Well, this is our first session.
It's a little hard to tell.
Are you prepared to answer some questions?
Ask me anything.
All right. How do you feel about sex?
I think it's great.
So do I, Nancy.
Well, I mean, I think it's great if it's at the right time and the right place.
You've led a strange life here, Wilbur.
I was raised by my grandfather, and he taught me all the things he knows.
I had to work harder than most kids, but it hasn't been so bad.
Well, I come from the city and... well, I just... I don't know, I never felt so relaxed or had such peace of mind.
I think the country does that for people.
Nancy, why don't you stay the weekend? well, I'd like to, Wilbur, but I... I couldn't.
But you'd like to, though, huh?
Her car's there.
She's gotta be around somewhere.
What do you want?
Pardon us.
We're looking for our friend...
Nancy Wagner.
I'm dr. Armitage and this is
Elizabeth Hamilton.
We met your grandson
Wilbur yesterday in the university.
Armitage? what would my grandson want with you?
He came to see me about a book I own, the Necronomicon.
Look, is my girlfriend here or isn't she?
No! go away!
Go away!
Were you looking for us, doctor?
Nancy!
Are you all right?
I was worried about you.
Of course she's all right.
She's not a child.
She drove me home last night and then she decided to stay the weekend.
Didn't you, Nancy?
Yes. yes, I did.
So if that's what you came to see about, doctor,
I guess we'll be saying goodbye.
Nancy, wait a second.
Do you know what you're doing?
Of course I know what I'm doing.
I'm staying with Wilbur.
Nancy... bye, Elizabeth.
Boy, I really can't believe
She dragged dr. Armitage all the way up here.
I mean, that's something I...
I expect from my mother.
Doesn't matter.
Would you like some more tea?
Please.
You tired, or is it the company?
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't know,
I'm kinda sleepy.
Well, we did take a long walk today.
Yeah.
Maybe you could use a little nap.
You know, that's not a bad idea. um, we are going to town, aren't we?
Sure. But I think you'll enjoy yourself more if you can keep your eyes open. um, I'll be all right.
You lied to me.
Now tell me the truth!
Keep your voice down, will you?
Why is she here?
I told you, her car broke down.
What about this?
Don't be ridiculous.
And those people.
You told me no one knew she was here.
They don't matter.
That man Armitage wrote the paper on my father.
He knows all about us.
I don't have to answer to you.
I do what I want.
Come back here!
Let the book be!
You know, it happened
25 years ago.
They were a strange family.
I just hope there's something in there.
This used to be the town bank, you know.
Ah, here it is.
This is the one.
Let's get it out in the light.
Ah, here it is just like I told you.
"Mother named Lavinia, father unknown.
"Child called Wilbur."
I set that type myself
25 years ago.
Who was the delivering physician?
Same old doc that delivers all of them around here... doc Cory.
Thank you, mr. Fuller.
Elizabeth...
Dr. Armitage!
If I were you, I'd stay away from the Whateleys.
Elizabeth.
That was the original town square.
70 years ago, there was a big oak tree right there in the middle of the street.
That's where the people of Dunwich lynched my great-grandfather.
They just let him hang there for days and days and days and days.
Then they burned the tree down to the ground.
Wilbur, stop it.
It's just history.
Why did they do it?
Because he didn't believe in what they believed.
Because he wasn't afraid of their god or their devil either, for that matter.
In fact, he thought they were pretty much alike.
What did he believe in?
In another race of beings from a different dimension.
An earlier race, superior to man.
And he believed they could be brought back.
You mean they
Hanged him for that?
Yes.
They trumped up
A murder charge
To cover it up.
A girl had disappeared and...
Then without a shred of evidence,
They went after him.
They claimed he used her
In some sort of sacrifice.
You must be worried, too,
To go to all of this trouble.
Ok, the doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
I won't be long.
Dr. Cory?
Yes?
I'm Henry Armitage, doctor of philosophy.
I'm lecturing at the university in Arkham.
Oh, yes, yes, well...
What can I do for you, doctor?
I'm... not sure.
I have a rather strange request.
Well, a country doctor is used to them.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
Well, now...
Please go ahead.
I'd like to ask you some questions
About the Whateley family.
Well, that's an odd bird of an ailment,
But it flares up now and again in these parts.
Haven't you ever been there?
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't go near that place.
Why?
Oh, that place
Gives me the creeps.
But why?
Well... some say
That old Whateley and Wilbur aren't alone...
That there's something else.
What do you mean
"something else"?
I... I don't know exactly, but, uh...
When I was a little kid,
The other children and I,
We thought the old Whateley house was haunted.
Of course, I don't believe that anymore,
But I keep away
And so does everyone else.
Anyway, the old man and Wilbur, they haven't allowed anyone on the place in years.
Oh.
Well, a friend of mine is out there right now.
What?
Yeah.
She's out there with Wilbur.
Wilbur Whateley has a girlfriend?
Oh, I don't believe it!
Well, hasn't it ever happened before?
Not with any girl around here.
I saw your name on the birth records.
Well...
You have me in an awkward position, doctor.
And before
I can reveal
Anything to you,
I must know the purpose of your inquiry.
Of course. Dr. Cory, this will sound quite fantastic, but I ask your indulgence.
Please bear with me and then decide for yourself.
Where the Whateleys are concerned, there is very little that is not fantastic.
I wonder what's going on.
Look...
I don't want to worry you, but if I had a friend down at weird Wilbur's,
I'd get her out of there.
Let me put it this way, doctor.
The legend of the Necronomicon has it that long ago the earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension.
With certain chants from the book, coupled with ancient rites and sacrifices, this race, the Old Ones, can be brought back.
And mankind?
Destroyed.
And from what you've seen of young Whateley,
You think it's actually possible
That he might believe that?
The book, the girl...
I don't know what to think.
If he does believe the legend, from my impression of Wilbur, he'd be capable of anything.
If he does attempt one of those rituals, that girl is in grave danger.
Well, it's hard to accept.
But then, it wouldn't be the first time that someone else paid the penalty for Whateley fanaticism.
Oh?
Yes, you see...
It wasn't I who delivered young Whateley.
It was his grandfather.
It's been
25 years, but I'll never forget that day
As long as I live.
I was in Osborne's store,
Just chatting with a few of the locals.
Old Whateley came running in all of a sudden, all wild-eyed and crazier than ever.
But nobody ever saw much of the Whateleys in town, so it was a surprise right off.
He always took a lot of jeering from the townsfolk.
Well, they didn't waste a minute's time before they started in on him.
I don't care what you folks say.
If Lavinia's boy looked like his pa, he'd wouldn't look like nothing you expect.
You needn't think that the only folks are the folks hereabouts.
Lavinia's read some
And has seen some things that most of you can only tell about.
Some day, you folks'll hear a child of Lavinia's
Calling his
Father's name from the top of Sentinel Hill.
And then you'll know!
And you'll wish to god you didn't!
All right, fellas, that's it.
As I entered the bedroom, there were 2 elderly albino women, robed entirely in black, standing watchfully over her.
She was burning up with fever and soaking wet.
God only knows what went on out there that day.
It was plain to see she'd been out in the rain.
They told me that she'd had twins.
One of them was stillborn.
Though I never saw the body.
And since old Whateley's not allowed anyone out there since, it's possible that baby may have lived.
It's a miracle that Wilbur came through it all right.
Lavinia's insides were all torn up.
Well, I did everything
I could for her.
She was so far gone,
I was lucky to save her life.
Her mind was gone forever.
Of course, we never did find out who the father was.
And the 2 old women?
I don't know.
Never saw them around here before or since.
Where's Lavinia now?
Incredible.
It is hard to believe
That she's only
45 years old.
She's been here now for more than 20 years.
There's been no appreciable change.
Walk unseen
In lonely places...
Old Ones...
Oh, my sons,
Open the Gate, my sons!
Could I go in
And talk to her?
I'm afraid not.
She's violent.
At times, extremely so.
I'd like to try.
It wouldn't do any good.
Lavinia?
Lavinia?
I want to talk to you.
Kill them all!
Let them in!
Kill them all!
Do you think you've had enough to eat?
Oh, plenty.
Well, let's take a walk.
There's something
I want to show you.
Okay.
You all right?
Yeah. I'm just a little dizzy.
I'll help you.
It's not far.
I'll be all right.
It's not much further.
What's in the package?
Look.
It's just fantastic.
What is it?
No one knows exactly.
Legend has it that it's been here forever.
It's called the Devil's Hopyard.
Fertility rites were practiced here, so they say.
Is this an altar?
Yes.
But what was it used for?
When the seasons
And the cycles of the moon were ripe,
Then they came one by one and gathered among these stones.
And they selected a beautiful girl like you.
Do you remember what we talked about this morning?
Yes.
When you asked me that question about sex?
Yes?
I lied.
I know.
Then they placed the girl's virginal body upon the altar, naked to the elements.
And their black robes blending into the night, they lighted candles and gathered round to observe and to relish her nakedness.
And then they waited.
They waited for the moment
When she would allow the power of darkness to enter her.
The moment when the gate would open and the Old Ones would come through.
And a strange chant echoed in the night.
Yog-Sothoth...
Yog-Sothoth!
Hello! Is anybody here?
Hello!
I thought I told you to stay away from here.
I'm not staying away from anywhere.
I'm looking for my girlfriend,
And I wanna see her now.
She's not here!
Now get off my land!
I'm going inside!
No, you're...
Don't touch me!
Nancy?
Nancy, it's
Elizabeth!
Nancy?
Stop!
Nancy?
Where are you?
No!
There's a car outside. Who's here?
She came looking for her friend.
Make sense, will you?
Who's here?
She went up those stairs.
Elizabeth.
Wilbur, where's Elizabeth?
I don't know.
He knows.
Shut up, you old fool!
You're the fool!
I know your plan!
You can't succeed!
You disgust me.
You've taken their abuse, and you've given up.
They've broken you.
But the Old Ones are coming back.
I'm going to let them through.
No! I tried and I destroyed your mother.
You'll fail, too.
You'll destroy her!
Oliver had the book.
It didn't help.
He had the wrong girl.
She resisted and she died.
Now you listen to me.
I'm going to succeed where you failed.
I'll stop you!
I'll stop you!
Stop... him...
Wilbur... those birds...
What does it mean?
They were trying to capture his soul as it left his body.
But they're quiet now.
They didn't get him.
He's free.
Darkness leads unto darkness.
Let this soul transcend the bounds of earth and be delivered to the spirit of darkness.
Death shall be the carriage of this soul.
Let the cry of the birds transport the spirit.
Yog-Sothoth...
Accept this man into the death of darkness.
Hear me, Old Ones, for your time is coming.
This death shall mark the beginning of your journey.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Nyagh Yog-Sothoth.
See? I told you he was here.
He's burying the old man.
Like hell, he is!
From darkness we came...
All right, hold it!
We bury our trash at the county dump, not here!
This is a christian cemetery.
No place here for your kind.
From darkness we came...
I said hold it!
Give me that book.
Now, you get out here.
You take your garbage with you!
When I'm finished.
You're finished now!
All right, hold on!
Hold on, you two!
What in hell are you trying to do?
I was trying to bury my grandfather.
We got family buried here.
We don't want no Whateleys among them.
We own this plot, and
I have the right to use it.
No one's getting buried just yet.
There's been no death certificate issued on this body.
We'll have to take it back till it's all straightened out legally.
Come on, Nancy.
Now, Nancy, you'll wait right here, won't you?
I'll wait.
Put it back.
Pick it up.
Unh!
Hello?
Uh, Cory here.
Raskin just telephoned me from the asylum.
I thought you'd want to know.
Lavinia is dying.
From what?
What happened?
Well, I'm not sure, but it sounds as if all hell's breaking loose.
Well, can we go over there?
I'll pick you up.
No, it'll be faster if I meet you there.
Oh, do you remember the girl that was with me yesterday?
Yes.
I still haven't been able to reach her.
It just occurred to me.
She was talking with your nurse.
Well, Cora's right here,
I'll ask her.
Cora, the girl with dr. Armitage,
She didn't happen to say where she was going, did she?
Why no, doctor.
Well, I'm sorry, Armitage,
You're out of luck.
I'll see you at the asylum.
All right. Ok.
Now, Cora, I won't be back tonight,
So why don't you leave all that work till the morning?
No, I'd rather get it done this evening, doctor.
All right.
Well, suit yourself.
And be sure you...
Be sure you lock up, won't you?
Good night.
Good night.
We've done everything we can.
Blood pressure, pulse, respiration...
Everything is sky-high.
So it can't last much longer.
What caused it?
I wish i knew.
Listen.
The birds are in rhythm with her breathing.
Listen!
Yes... my son.
She's finished.
They've stopped.
What was she muttering?
The birds.
That chant.
The Necronomicon.
Dr. Cory,
I've got to get to the library right away.
Land of light... the army of darkness shall sweep down.
They are gathered like a horde of avengers, life within life, the power that summons.
Come back, Old Ones...
Princes of Darkness, and repossess the earth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
I summon you.
Come, brother of darkness.
Leave your prison and help me bring the Old Ones through.
Brother of my blood, my soul, I summon you.
The time has arrived.
Now we wait no longer.
We must act.
Upon this sacrifice, shall the journey begin.
"Yog-o-oth. Yog-o-oth.
"Join the circle, complete the chain.
"Yog-Sothoth is the gate
"whereby the spheres meet.
"And with the gate open,
"the Old Ones shall be.
"Man rules now where they ruled once.
"They wait, patient and potent,
"for here they shall reign again,
"and rule where they once walked.
"The Old Ones broke through of old,
"and they shall break through again".
Yog-Sothoth!
We thank thee, o Lord, for the food we are about to take for the nourishment of our bodies.
Amen.
Something's bothering Rusty.
Been acting strange, all right.
What's the matter, baby lamb?
Please...
Lucille?
Ah!
The gate is opening now.
We don't have long to wait.
You're one of us now.
It's time.
You saw what Wilbur did to get the book.
He's going to try to let the Old Ones through.
Whether they exist or not doesn't matter.
He's not responsible for his actions.
If you're right, how are we going to handle it?
What? Something's going on.
Well, that's the Cole place.
Harrison.
- I tried to call you, doc.
- What's happened?
All hell's busted loose.
Damn Whateleys.
No man would have mutilated the bodies that way.
I don't say the Whateleys did it,
But damn it, they're responsible.
Settle down, Reeger.
Settle down? There're dead people in there.
What do you mean settle down?
Reeger's right.
Let's go get them!
You can't do this.
You stop them,
Reeger, or I will.
Well, let's go!
My family's not gonna...
Come on, let's go!
Stop! Stop, you can't kill Wilbur Whateley.
He didn't do this,
But he may be the only man who can save us from what did.
Why should we listen to you?
Well, you all know me.
I delivered most of you.
I'm telling you to listen to this man.
He's the only one who can help us.
What do you want me to do?
Get in your cars,
And meet us at the Whateley place.
Come on.
Listen!
What in god's name is that?
I've never heard anything like that.
Henry, it's really happening, isn't it?
It's moving toward the hill.
The Devil's Hopyard.
We've got to get up there.
All right, now,
Let's all spread out,
And all of you, stay on your toes.
Hurry up, let's go.
Start up that way.
You all right, Reeger?
Yeah
Go on,
I'll catch up.
I jammed the damn rifle.
You find anything?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
My god, what's he doing?
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth.
Yog-Sothoth!
Ah!
No.
Oh, no. No.
I'm sorry, Nancy.
There were 2 children born that night
25 years ago.
Dr. Cory was told the other one died, but it didn't.
It was caught between this world and another.
Wilbur's twin took after the father.
And the father?
Not of this earth.
It's all over now.
The last of the Whateleys is dead.
Who will rescue me
Oh, who will rescue me
Who will rescue me
I'm lost at sea
Without a friend
This journey
Will it ever end
Who will
Rescue
Me
Rescue me
Rescue me
Attention, please.
The economic and social council will convene in five minutes.
G-Good day, sir.
G-Good day, Mr. Ambassador.
How do you do, madam?
Order. Order.
This emergency meeting... of the International Rescue Aid Society is now in session.
Delegates, you have been summoned from all corners of the globe... because we have reason to believe that someone is in distress.
As you know, our society has never failed to answer a call for help.

Mr. Bernard, if you please.
C-C-Coming through.
Uh, pardon me.
Have a care there.
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.
Uh-- Excuse me, sir.
- Oops.
- Egad!
Delegates, this is no time for levity.
Serious business, you know.
Serious business.
Now what?
Sir, there, uh-- there-- there are
1 3 steps on this ladder.
Oh, superstitious nonsense.
What next?
Oh, um, sorry, sir.
I'll, uh-- I'll have it-- have it out in-in a jiffy, sir.
''To Morningside Orphanage, New York.''
It's difficult to decipher.
I can't make it out.
''I am... in terrible... terrible trouble.''
Oh, oh, dear, it's all watered out.
''Hurry.
Help. Penny.''
Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please... please, may I have this assignment?
You, Miss Bianca?
Dear lady, it's absolutely without precedent.
I mean, it's not like the old days when it was a man's world.
However, I suppose there has to be a first time.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca should go. It could be dangerous.
I mean, I mean, any-- anything could-- could happen to her.
You see, dear lady, before our janitor interrupted...
I was about to suggest that you should have a co-agent go with you.
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?
Gentlemen, this is indeed a-- a most difficult decision to make.
I choose...
Mr. Bernard to be my co-agent.
M-Me? Oh, th-that's-- that's really very, uh--
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.
Oh, come on!
Bravo! Bravo!
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.
Morningside Orphanage.
Here. H-Here it is.
Three blocks down and... uh, uh, four blocks over.
Well, why don't we take the shortcut through the zoo?
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--
I-I don't know. I mean, it's-- you know, it could be risky.
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?
Through storm and rain and dark of night--
Never fail to do what's right.
All right, duty calls.
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um, maybe we'd better go back.
It's so dark in there.
Dark?
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.
Wait for me!
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks down and, uh, four blocks over?
What did you do to make him so mad?
Nothing. He's just a-- just a grumpy old lion.
Well, after all, waking him up in the middle of the night--
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?
I didn't wake him up in the middle of the night.
I was walking through the thing, and he just--
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around, see what I can find.
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.
Boy, the things kids collect.
Do you think she could be still here in the orphanage?
Well, s-she can't be. It says on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''
Well, maybe she's been adopted.
No, because she would've taken these things with her.
- Mice!
- Cat!
Now, lookee here, you two... if folks find out that mice moved in here...
I-I'll get kicked out, lose my job.
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.
I'm a mite too old to be chasin' mice.
Uh, sir, could-- could you tell us what happened to a little girl named Penny?
I sure can. But you ain't gonna find her around here.
The poor little thing ran away.
When-- When was the last time you saw Penny?
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.
Let's see now. Uh--
The last time I saw her... she was sittin' over there on her bed, all alone.
She looked awful sad, and so I asked her--
What's wrong, Penny honey?
Nothing.
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.
You tell old Rufus, huh?
Well, it was adoption day at the orphanage.
Well, what happened?
A man and a lady came and looked at me... but they choosed a little redheaded girl.
She was prettier than me.
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.
You're something extra special.
No, I'm not.
Why, someday a mama and a papa will come to the orphanage... looking for a pretty little girl just like you.
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.
But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.
Well, faith is a bluebird... you see from afar.
It's for real, and as sure as the first evening star.
You can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same... making things turn out right.
Can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same, making things turn out right.
But whoever adopts me has to adopt Teddy too.
Oh, they'll love him.
He doesn't eat much, does he?
Oh, here!
I brought you something.
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!
No! They're ginger snaps!
Well, an old codger like me could use a little ginger.
I taked two extra ones for lunch today.
We're not supposed to do that.
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.
I love you, Rufus.
Gee, we'd better hurry, or we'll be late for supper!
She seemed happy enough, but the next thing I heard...
Penny was gone.
Well, aren't-- aren't the police still looking for her?
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.
I just can't believe that Penny would run away.
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.
Well, come to think of it, there was.
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.
Get in what? W-With who?
Oh, a weird lady tried to give Penny a ride... but she wouldn't have anything to do with trashy people like them.
Trashy people? Who?
She and her partner run a sleazy pawn shop down the street.
Miss Bianca, we must go down there and investigate.
Suit yourself, but you'd be wasting your time going down there.
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?
Bernard, uh, a child's book!
It's Penny's!
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.
W-What's so funny?
Y-Your tail!
Here, here, let me help you fix it.
Who could be ringing at this time of night?
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!
You've found the diamond!
Give you time?
You bungler!
You have been down there for three months.
Bottles? What bottles?
You caught Penny sending messages in bottles?
You blundering fool!
Can't you control a little girl?
Shut up! I am taking the next flight down to Devil's Bayou!
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.
Leave him for a few weeks and--
Oh, why won't this stupid thing close?
Out of my way, you road hog!
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4.
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does have to pack a few things, you know.
Will Mr.Jenkins report to the ticket counter, please?
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4, now departing.
Flight leaves 6:45.
Oh, no, we missed the flight.
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.
You know that flights are always late.
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.
Luck? Flight 1 3?
Maybe we'd better take the train.
Wake up.!
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?
Uh, h-h-hello?
Where have you been, oh,you lazy knucklehead?
W-We-We just got here, sir.
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent insisted on packing her, uh--
Look, bud, am I clear to land?
Traffc up here is thicker than fleas on a hound dog's--
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog-- road hog-- Crazy--
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.
Well, then give him the permission to land.
Uh, Captain, you, uh-- you have our permission to land.
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!
Doesn't he fly beautifully?
And you wanted to take the train, you 'fraidy cat.
'Fraidy cat?
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.
I mean, they serve, uh, Roquefort, uh--
Pull up! Pull up!
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.
Oh, great.
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.
Play it safe.
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville, little lady.
All right, all right, uh, it's most important we get to Devil's Bayou.
Well, now, will you just keep your shirt on?
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder in five minutes.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven... twelve-- Oh, no.
There are 1 3 steps on this ramp.
Well, why don't you jump the last one?
This is your captain speaking.
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.
Just sit back and leave the driving to me.
Miss Bianca, be sure it's fastened good and tight.
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.
Say, bud, read the checklist to me.
Uh, oh, yeah.
Goggles down.
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.
''If at first you don't succeed... try, try again.''
And here we go!
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Oh, I just love takeoffs!
Captain, you fly beautifully.
It's just like being on a ''roller scoater.''
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.
Come along
Will there be sunshine shinin'
Will we find a silver linin'
Come along
Sing a song
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow
Sing a song
Is it wrong
To put all our hopes together
And wish for somethin'better
Is it wrong
To be loved
To face the future with another
Who means more than any other
Is to be loved
We'll paint the grey clouds
With pretty rainbow hues
And we'll brush the gloom away
And save it for a rainy day
Rainy day
Oh, today
If troubles cast a shadow
And shadows make the sun afraid to stay
Why, it's okay
'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
And we'll find the silver linin'
Another day
Uh, listen to this.
It says here Devil's Bayou is uncharted and hazardous.
Each day's operations...
Hmm, interesting. must be...
Good night, dear. planned with... care and--
Tomorrow is another day
Good night, Bianca.
How I hope you'll always stay
Penny!
Penny?
Penny, answer me!
Penny?
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
That little brat has escaped again.
Nero, Brutus, bring her back, boys.
Why won't it start?
Snoops! What's wrong?
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.
Oh, shut up!
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!
Well, folks, we'll be landing at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.
Your crew thanks you for flying Albatross Air--
What in the--
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!
Bail out! Bail out!
Help!
Bernard!
Mayday! Mayday!
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?
Luke! Luke, wake up!
Luke, get down here!
It's Orville!
Oh, that Orville.
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!
I'm a-comin'.
Wow-wee!
This new batch really packs a wallop!
Look out below!
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.
Say, cousin, you look like you could use a swig of this.
It's good for what ails ya.
There.
Where are you folks from, anyway?
We're--
We're from New Y-- New York.
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna hang around this creepy place long.
Clear the runway!
Great balls of fire!
Holy smoke!
Why don't you watch where you're goin'!
Bernard, it's that terrible Medusa.
I'd like to give her a few whacks with my rollin' pin.
We swamp folks would like to run her clean out of our bayou.
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.
Why did you have to go and spoil everything?
Nero, don't you dare get my teddy bear wet.
Oh, it's that poor little young 'un.
She's tryin' to run away again.
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.
Hurry! We've got to find out where they're taking her!
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's got the fastest boat around here.
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!
Send Evinrude back as soon as you need help.
I'll round up the neighbors!
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!
You stop that, Brutus.
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Oh, dear! We've lost them!
Jehoshaphat!
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!
Help me, Bernard!
Help! Bernard!
Bianca!
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.
Keep trying, Evinrude.
Poor Evinrude.
Your carburettor is all pooped out.
Bring her right on in, boys.
Come on.
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?
Put me down, Brutus!
Cranky old dragon.
Nice work. Good boys.
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!
There, there, Teddy.
I won't let them do that to you again. Don't cry.
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.
All she ever thinks about is that simple bear.
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero and Brutus have your old teddy bear.
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em... like you are, Mr. Snoops.
Oh, don't you sass me.
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty little girl to her room.
I can go by myself, thank you.
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.
Look out! Here she comes!
Where is she? Where is she?
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.
Those leather-headed lizards of yours, they're supposed to be patrolling the island.
They let her get away.
Ha! My precious pets.
We know who caught that ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?
It was your brilliant idea to use the little girl for this caper.
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.
I know, I know. She's the only one small enough to squeeze down the black hole.
Yes, but why can't she find my big diamond?
I don't know, but-- but just look at these beauties that she brought up from the cave.
Oh, they'll sell for a lot of cold cash.
Ow!
I wish you wouldn't do that.
She's insane. Utterly mad.
I want that diamond.
I've got to have the Devil's Eye!
You didn't leave the girl down in the cave long enough.
She won't take orders.
You are too soft.
But the water was rising and the tide was coming in... and all she did down there was fuss about her teddy bear getting wet.
Snoops, you don't have a way with children.
You must gain their confidence... make them like you.
Yeah? How do you do that?
You force them to like you, idiot!
At the next low tide...
I am going to put her down there myself... and keep her there... until she finds it.
And it is as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.
Yes.
Now come along, petsy-poos.
We gotta get Penny out of here tonight.
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!
Let go, you-you-you, you big bullies, you!
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!
I mean now!
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!
Oh, Snoops, kill it!
Look! There's another one!
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?
Snoops! What's wrong?
I don't--
E-E-Evinrude, over here!
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.
That-- That-- That terrible woman!
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.
Wh-What can two little mice do?
R-E-S-C-U-E
Rescue Aid Society
But, Bernard, the Society's counting on us.
We can't quit now.
Oh, and that little girl.
We've just got to rescue her.
Rescue Aid Society
Heads held high
Penny dear!
Auntie Medusa wants to talk to you!
High tide or not... that little brat is going to find me that diamond... tomorrow... or else!
Come in. Come in.
Did you want to see me, ma'am?
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.
Now, I am going to let bygones be bygones.
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?
Yes, you want me to find that diamond.
That's right, dear!
But I've tried hard as I could, honest.
Of course you have.
But we must try harder, mustn't we?
Then please will you take me back to the orphanage like you promised?
Penny, don't you like it here?
A big, beautiful boat all to yourself.
But if I don't get back to the orphanage...
I'll never get 'dopted.
Adopted?
What makes you think anyone would want... a homely little girl like you?
Be brave, little one
Make a wish
For each sad little tear
Hold your head up
Though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you
Don't cry, little one
There'll be a smile
Where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you
Always keep a little prayer
In your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll bejoy and happiness
And your little world
Will be bright
Have faith, little one
Till your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave
Little one
Someone's waiting
To love
You
Good night, Teddy.
Sleep tight.
Oh, we almost forgot to say our prayers.
Please bless Rufus and Teddy... and all the kids at the orphanage--
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.
Because running away isn't working. Amen.
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--
We'll be all right.
Penny. Penny.
Yes?
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?
We found the bottle with-- with your message, and we've come to rescue you.
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!
Didn't you bring somebody big with you... like the police?
Uh, no, there's-- there's just the-- the two of us.
But if the three of us work together, and we have a little faith--
That's what Rufus said.
Faith makes things turn out right.
Penny, I know it's late, but we have to escape tonight, right now.
But I just got caught by Brutus and Nero.
Look what they did to my pants.
Yeah, and they're-- they're still down there guarding the gangplank.
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.
See there? The elevator.
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.
Great idea.
Now, uh, wha-wha-- what can we use for bait?
Oh, they'll eat anything.
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow the scent right into the elevator.
And I'll slam the door.
And would that make Medusa mad.
Brutus! Nero!
Did you let that little brat escape again?
You're too soft.
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.
That's exactly like Medusa.
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.
And we'll be so far ahead, they'll never catch us.
Wait a minute. She-- She might catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up wh-wh-while we're starting it?
W-We're in trouble.
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.
It's just got to work.
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--
I bet those two are up to something.
Gee, I don't wanna go down that awful black hole again.
Don't worry about that, dear.
You must hurry and get dressed.
Come on.
We haven't got much time.
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.
An-And hurry!
Ya-hoo!
Are you ready to help rescue that little young 'un?
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!
Luke! On your feet, you lazy critter!
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin' for someone to holler ''charge''!
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin' and get a-goin'!
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up, his nose gets plumb out of joint.
Take it easy, Gramps.
We gotta stay here till Evinrude brings us word from them mice.
If'n that bug don't get here soon... they'll put that poor little girl down the black hole again.
All right, you little brat. Now, you are gonna go down in that hole... and you are gonna dig till you find me the diamond.
You understand that?
And no sassing me.
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops, that is no way to speak... to our little Miss Penny.
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.
Now, my dear... you are going to find the big, shiny diamond... for your Auntie Medusa.
Aren't you?
Teddy doesn't like it down there.
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?
Ah. Poor Teddy.
I'll just keep him up here with me, where he'll be safe.
Give me back my teddy bear!
He's mine! He's mine!
You get down there and find the big diamond... or you will never see that Teddy again!
All right, all right.
I'll go.
Boss, you've really got a way with kids.
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.
I'll find her old diamond.
Oh, what a dreadful, frightening place.
Yeah, it used to be a pirates' cave.
How do you know that, Penny?
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for that diamond so we can get out of here.
Oh, I looked there already.
Medusa doesn't want those little ones.
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?
That's where the water comes in.
I'm afraid to go over there.
Well, if I was a pirate... that's just where I'd hide the Devil's Eye.
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.
Uh, come-- c-come to think of it... if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.
Bernard, look!
I can see something.
Come on.
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.
You-- You stay here.
I'll see if I can find a safe way over.
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!
- Help!
- I'm coming!
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.
Well, look faster.
Wow!
P-Penny, hold-- hold your lantern up again.
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.
Penny, we found it!
We found it!
Medusa, I found it!
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!
Back! Ah, good girl.
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.
Look, it won't go through.
I can't get it out.
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.
Stuck tight?
You get that diamond, or you'll never see daylight again!
No, no, back! Back, Penny!
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.
Not until you get the diamond.
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.
Penny! Penny, help!
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!
Faster, Snoops. Faster.
Pulling as fast as I can.
At last!
The Devil's Eye!
It's worth millions!
Just look at it.
Filled with power... for its owner.
Let me-- Let me look at it.
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.
But I know that there's enough there to cut it into two equal shares.
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?
And it's mine. It's all mine.
All yours? Half of it is mine, you double-crossing crook!
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!
Land's sakes!
It's Evinrude!
Oh, well, sure is a mess.
Where in tarnation you been, boy?
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be quitting now, must we?
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!
He's plumb tuckered out.
Here, son, this'll make a new bug out of you.
Charge! Ya-hoo!
We're gonna have us a rip-snortin' fight.
Yee-hoo! Charge!
Where'd everybody go?
I don't need any help from anybody!
Charge! Ya-hoo!
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.
If either of you try to follow me... you'll get blasted!
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.
Teddy goes with me, my dear.
I've become quite attached... to him.
My diamond!
My diamond!
Charge!
Now!
Now! Now!
Look out!
Oh, please start.
Advance the spark.
Not the horn, the spark lever.
Digger, hold this.
It's that doohickey on the steering wheel.
You-- You... and your infernal fireworks!
You-- You--
Oh, you dunderhead!
We're not getting any gas.
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!
Look out! The riverboat!
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!
Bernard, you're wonderful!
- We did it!
- We got her!
We sure showed that Medusa!
There goes... my diamond!
And because of a courageous little girl named Penny... the world's largest diamond, the Devil's Eye... is now in the Smithsonian Institute.
But what's even more important, folks... this little orphan's dream has come true.
Today she's being adopted.
-And here she is with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
From Morningside Orphanage
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage
You are a darling.
Penny,you were a brave little girl to do what you did all by yourself.
Oh, I didn't do it all by myself.
Two little mice from the Rescue Aid Society helped me.
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?
Yes, they rescued me.
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!
Hi, Bernard.!
You can talk to these little mice?
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.
Didn't you know that?
Well, uh, I didn't, but I do now, Penny.
Evinrude, what are you doing here?
It's another call for help.
Here, uh, uh... you're gonna need some volunteers.
But-- B-But, B-Bianca, we just--
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills... intrigue, travel, exotic places.
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Tomorrow is another day
How I hope you'll always stay
Tomorrow is another day
oh, Father.
Father Merrin, in the valley of the shadow of death...
...be at my side. why me?
I heal the sick. why me? okay, 8:00 tomorrow.
Debbie.
Debbie, can you hear it?
No?
I'll turn it up.
Debbie, Debbie.
You can hear it?
Mother's late. She's never on time.
- Hi.
- Hi, Regan! You're right on time.
- For once.
- Yeah. what's happening?
Not much.
- Any dreams?
- No dreams. okay.
- Look, I'm just wasting your time.
- Why do you say that?
- Well, you know why I come here.
- Well, you tell me.
- To make my mom feel better.
- Explain that, would you?
- She feels guilty.
- Why?
Divorce, her career...
...away all the time.
Regan? Why don't you tell me the truth? Don't you trust me?
But I do. I do.
You keep saying you don't remember that time in washington.
I don't know if I believe you.
I remember being very sick and having nightmares, and that's all.
Those bad dreams are still inside you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Regan? Regan?
I want to show you something.
You see this? This is a machine we can use together.
It can put us in a state of hypnosis.
You'd be very relaxed and comfortable.
And then we could look at those bad dreams together and understand them.
And dissolve them.
You wouldn't be alone, Regan.
- How do you feel about that?
- I don't think you're ready for it. what does that mean?
You're the doctor. You explain it.
Follow me, please. cardinal Jaros, may I present Father
Philip Lamont, Society of Jesus? would you care to explain your refusal to accept this task?
I should be relieved from all pastoral responsibilities. I'm not worthy.
Father, I have not asked you to perform another exorcism.
I simply requested that you investigate the death of Father Merrin.
You have performed exorcisms.
You knew Father Merrin.
Furthermore, you were exposed to his teachings.
I cannot think of anyone more qualified for this assignment.
Philip, it's so good to see you.
Merrin's reputation is in jeopardy.
His writings have been impounded.
I'm not surprised. No one in the church wants to hear about the devil.
Satan has become an embarrassment to our progressive views.
Merrin was rather more extreme,
I'm afraid.
He argued that the power of evil threatens to overthrow God himself.
So they found a heresy to nail him to. well, many of the theological college believe that...
...he died at the hands of the devil...
...during that American exorcism.
Some, and they are close to the pontiff, go so far as to suggest...
...that he was a Satanist.
At the end, I mean.
Perhaps Father Merrin took a path no one could follow.
But how he inspired us, Philip!
Here. Remember, christ is hard to follow too. we were young. Today, wherever I look, I see only evil.
God has fallen silent.
I cannot move to safeguard
Merrin's testament...
...until all the facts about his last exorcism are clearly known.
You will conduct the investigation.
You will act discreetly in all confidence, reporting to me alone.
But I'm not worthy!
You are a soldier of christ.
Make yourself worthy. okay, I want you to concentrate hard on the name of this color. All right?
- Gene Tuskin, Father.
- Lamont, doctor. come on in.
- Liz, what does he want?
- How would I know, Regan?
He's here about me, isn't he? why do you say that? what about the coroner's report, the testimony? The file's that thick.
Yes, I know.
Unfortunately, it sheds very little light on Father Merrin's death.
I was hoping to question the girl.
- Why don't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Regan suffered a severe trauma by that experience.
I think the exorcism made the problem worse.
You must know that three people died.
Regan's guilt was so great, she repressed everything.
I'm sorry, Father.
I can't let you question her.
The shock of recall could result in self-punishment.
I couldn't rule out suicide.
You have a heavy responsibility: the care of her soul.
The care of her mind and her body is my responsibility, Father.
You realize what you're up against, don't you?
- What am I up against, Father?
- Evil.
Mental illness.
That's what we're up against here. or the casualties of a diseased society. Evil is not...
Evil is a spiritual being, alive and living.
Perverted and perverting, weaving its way into the very fabric of life.
- Sorry to disturb you.
- What is it?
I've changed my mind. I'd like to try that machine after all.
- Fine.
- Could we try it now?
I'm sorry. I won't intrude any longer.
It's okay, Father.
You can stay if you'd like.
Regan, this is Father Lamont.
Regan MacNeil.
- Hello.
- How do you do? well, we can do it tomorrow then, Regan. Okay?
Father, maybe you can help me.
- All right, Regan?
- Good.
These experiments confirm that thought can be transmitted across distances.
- Here he is, causing a spoon to bend.
- Sharon.
- Not on a stage...
- Look, I can do it.
...but under iaboratory controis and observed by skepticai scientists.
- It's easy.
- Good God, Regan.
...they seem to defy naturai iaws.
How can that be? oh, look, you fool.
You believe everything! oh, wait, wait.
...but is mereiy an iiiusion: a projection of the mind.
These are EEG biofeedback electrodes.
They pick up any brain frequency.
They're integrated with these strobes...
...to bring two altered states into synchronization.
- Are you ready, Regan?
- Yes. we're going to do this just the way I showed you.
Now, I want you to relax your arms.
Now, I want you to concentrate on the strobe light.
Deeply relax.
Just let yourself go and look at the light.
Now, I want you to relax and make your tone go deeper.
Listen to your tone.
Deeper.
Deeper, Regan. can you hear me, Regan?
Yes. when you hear the alarm buzzer, you will wake up and feel fine...
...but you will remember nothing that happened. Do you understand?
Yes. very good. Now, do you remember your room in washington?
Yes.
- Can you see your room?
- No.
Then I want you to go deeper.
Go deeper into your memory until you can see your room.
Make your tone go deeper, and you will see it.
Deeper.
Deeper, Regan. Deeper. can you see it now?
Yes.
I want to come down and be with you.
Do you remember how to help me?
Yes.
Good. Bring me down to where you are.
You and I will obey the commands that Liz and Father Lamont give us.
Do you understand?
Yes.
I'm going to turn my light on now.
And you will help me bring my tone down to yours. can you hear me, Gene?
Yes.
Relax, then.
And let yourself come down deeper and deeper...
...to meet my tone.
Relax.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Good.
- Doctor, can you see Regan's room?
- Yes.
Regan, do you remember the time
Father Merrin came up to you?
Yes.
Regan, you will now respond to Father Lamont.
- Regan?
- Yes?
That time in the room...
...try and remember Father Merrin just before he died.
- We're alone.
- Is his heart strong? Resolved?
He is praying.
- Is he in pain?
- Yes.
- Is he casting out the unclean spirit?
- He is praying.
And you, Regan. What are you doing?
Dr. Tuskin?
Gene?
Gene, wake up!
- What's wrong with Gene?
- Her heart, it's fibrillating!
Put that on. You've gotta go back and find her right now.
I know where she is. Help me to find and reach her. Liz, put this on.
- Liz, help me to reach Dr. Tuskin.
- All right, we'll try.
Relax deeply, watch the light.
That's good.
Let yourself go down deeper.
Listen to your tone, and make it go deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper. Deeper.
- Get thee hence!
- She's mine, always.
- No!
- Always.
- Always.
- Father, please. Bring her back.
Father, can you hear me?
Father, please. Bring her back.
In God's name!
Tell Gene she will not remember.
Gene, you will not remember.
Gene, you will not remember.
- What happened?
- Are you all right?
Your heart was fibrillating.
I don't know what went wrong.
I couldn't bring you out of it.
Father Lamont had to go into synch to contact you. He brought you out of it.
- He told you not to remember.
- Do you remember?
No.
Do you remember? come on, Regan.
I'll be right back.
I bet they're pretty drawings.
How are you? want me to draw a picture? what would you like me to draw?
- A house.
- A house? why do you want a house?
A house is dull.
How about if I draw you a face?
- How do you feel?
- All right. You? oh, I'm fine.
The psychological effects of synching with another mind last a long time.
It's very powerful.
- Did you see what you wanted to see?
- Evil is gaining.
- Father Merrin was killed.
- By Regan?
She didn't. It did.
It wasn't the mind of a child.
It was horrible. Utterly horrible.
And fascinating. we don't know all that much about synchronized hypnosis yet. what you saw could have easily been a dream, a fantasy, a hallucination.
Not a memory at all.
Names, just names. Better to see the face than hear the names.
I can't have a discussion now.
I have to do my rounds.
Doctor, what I saw...
I'm sorry.
It'll have to wait till tomorrow.
Hi, Amy.
Regan did a picture of you. what's it mean?
It's you. She draws well.
The flames.
Flames.
Doctor. Doctor, the flames.
They're getting bigger.
- We've got to put the fire out.
- Take it easy.
It's probably some post-flashing.
It's an aftereffect of hypnosis.
No, you've got to help me. we may be too late.
- Where you going?
- You've got to help me. Her picture.
- Come on, Father. Give me a break.
- No, there's a fire somewhere.
I'll get the fire department. okay.
You kids can go on in now.
Everything's okay. Go on in now.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- I got it.
Regan's picture, the flames.
She warned us.
That contact between us came about through your machine. whatever it was, it saved the children.
It took a machine. The work you're doing is incredible. Miraculous!
The machine is a device to penetrate pathological states.
No, you're talking about therapy.
You don't realize the importance!
As much as I enjoy recognition, you're overstating it.
Don't you understand that I was face to face with the evil in her?
Your machine has proved that there's an ancient demon within her! we must fight it, we must help her!
It's all okay now.
You can go on in, all right?
I was trying to help her before you came along.
You must let me synch with Regan!
In that way, you can control things. well, I just don't know.
Listen, you can go in now.
It's all clear, okay?
I know what concerns you.
That Regan will suddenly remember.
That she'll go into shock.
I believe that Regan already remembers everything.
The deaths, the possessions, the demons.
She's out there, all alone, trying to deal with this thing.
All by herself.
Come, Regan.
Come, Regan.
We're going fiying.
Far, far away. oh, good morning, Sharon. what got you up so early?
The doves woke me.
I guess they were hungry.
I may not be here when you get home. can you let yourself in?
- Will you be all right?
- Where are you going?
- Washington. I'll be back soon.
- Washington?
Some things your mother didn't do before going on location. oh, okay. wanna fly, babe? There you go, up.
I'm grateful to you for coming.
Mrs. MacNeil wants me to help you while I can.
She would do anything for Father Merrin.
She believes he gave his life for Regan.
Are they gonna make him a saint?
The world doesn't want any more saints.
This is not an official investigation. when Father Merrin arrived, how did he prepare himself?
Did he pray?
They couldn't explain it, the police, could they?
Did Father Merrin ever name the demon?
No.
It knew him, though.
- How do you know that?
- It called his name.
Did the demon seem to expect Father Merrin?
Yes.
It feared him, I think. was... was Father Merrin afraid?
You'd better see where it happened. what was her condition when Father Merrin saw her?
Hideous. That evil face.
- I couldn't bear to be near her after.
- You're with her now.
Two years I stayed away. Two haunted years, going out of my mind.
And all the time I longed to see her.
Finally, I came back and found that...
...when I'm with her is the only time I'm at peace. why would that be? I can't understand.
It frightens me.
Have you tried a psychiatrist or a priest?
- I'm talking to one now, aren't I?
- I'm not here for you.
There.
In there.
Praying. Have you tried praying?
Prayer?
I pray for the soul of Father Merrin, who died in this room.
And for Sharon, who was touched by the shadow of evil.
And for myself.
For myself.
- Next week then, Frank, okay?
- Is there any point going on?
I'll be in there fighting.
Just as long as you are.
- Hello.
- Hello. come on in.
Do you...?
- Do you have children of your own?
- Yes, I do. Two.
A boy and a girl.
I'd like to spend more time with them.
Must be difficult, with all your responsibilities.
Not to mention the complications of being divorced.
You seem to manage.
Your heart is good.
It's hard to live alone.
Don't you ever need a woman, Father?
Yes.
Telling secrets?
Do you remember dreaming of Father Merrin?
Yes. can you see him now?
Yes. where is he?
It was iong ago when I was studying the hoiy men of Africa.
This boy, this young boy...
...has very speciai powers.
They need his heip against the iocust swarm.
But perhaps this swarm comes...
...because of the boy.
Does great goodness draw evii upon itseif?
Now, Regan, Father Lamont is hypnotized too.
I want you to bring him down to you.
Tell him what to do.
Father Lamont?
Yes? call me.
Regan.
I am Pazuzu!
Pazuzu! call me by my dream name. call me.
Pazuzu.
King of the spirits of the air!
Pazuzu!
King of the evil spirits of the air!
Spirits of the air!
All-powerful God!
You gave power to your apostles to pass through dangers!
Give us strength!
Fear not! we are safe inside!
Even Pazuzu with all his legions...
...cannot transgress this holiest of places.
Get thee hence, Satan!
Be uprooted!
Be expelled from this creature of God!
I command you to the depths of hell!
- Merrin defeated you.
- No!
In his own piace of power, he gained a iittie time.
It was because the boy was a heaier that you attacked him. Now I see.
- But Merrin saved him!
- Never!
I couid ciaim Kokumo even now.
- I'ii show you power.
- He's stiii aiive!
- Where is he?
- You want me to take you to him?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Show me. come fly the teeth of the wind.
Share my wings.
- What was it?
- A leopard.
He jumped at me.
The boy's still alive.
He frightened Pazuzu.
- Do you remember anything?
- Was it in Africa? why do you say that?
It was like what I saw at the Natural History Museum.
- But you weren't supposed to remember.
- I know.
- Okay, Regan, that's all for today.
- Okay.
Pazuzu showed me that boy. He's a man now, in a strange mud city in Africa.
Perhaps I can find him.
He has a power over evil.
Regan recognized one of those places.
But she told us it was something she remembered from the museum.
Let me ask her.
Just a minute. Take it easy.
I want to take a look at you.
Hi.
Hi. Are you waiting for Dr. Tuskin?
She's very nice, isn't she? what's the matter with you?
I'm autistic.
How do you mean?
I'm withdrawn.
I can't talk.
But you're talking now.
Yes, you are. I can hear you.
- You can hear me?
- Sure! what's...
...the matter with you?
I was possessed by a demon. oh, it's okay. He's gone.
Dr. Tuskin would like Sandra to visit her voice therapy class.
Hey, Mom. You know what happened to her?
You're talking!
Talking! can you hear me, Mother?
She's talking!
- God...
- Call Gene.
Are you all right?
Mother, it's all right.
- What is it?
- Regan's got Sandra talking!
- What?
- I've got to take her right home!
Her father's got to hear before she stops!
- She's not going to stop.
- No, don't stop, baby, no!
- Keep talking!
- Come on in my office.
No! Her father would never forgive me.
I've got to take her home!
All right, take her home.
Liz, you go with them. come on. what did you do?
Nothing. I just started talking to her.
First she was talking inside, and then she started talking outside.
Gene, do you think I could start helping some of your other kids?
You know, Regan, it's very dangerous to fool with other people's heads.
Sandra seems to be all right...
...but don't try that again.
- Until...
- Until what? well, until you're older. okay. well, there's Sharon. Bye!
Don't tell Sharon because she'll just call Mom and worry her. Okay?
- I don't want to hear any speculation.
- She entered her mind!
- Let's stick to science.
- Don't hide behind science.
Listen, I'm responsible for Regan while her mother's away.
- You stay away from her! Cut it out!
- You must fight that demon inside her!
- It keeps her from spiritual power.
- Demons? we make our own, up here.
You're obsessed with the idea!
I'm not! I'm fascinated, but I know the dangers.
Father Merrin was afraid he'd slip into admiration.
How about adulation?
Hello, Father.
How did you know I was coming here? well, I didn't...
...for sure.
I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Doctor's orders.
Father?
- Do priests believe in ESP?
- Some do.
A French priest thought we'd all come together in some sort of telepathy.
A kind of "world mind" in which everybody would share. when is that supposed to happen?
I don't know.
Father Merrin believed that, with modern research, it could happen soon.
I mean the kind of research
Dr. Tuskin is doing.
But if it happens before we're ready...
...we may find ourselves pointing in the wrong direction, toward Satan.
Look, Father.
That's it!
That's where Father Merrin fought Pazuzu.
You remember Father Merrin? what else do you remember?
Everything.
Aren't you afraid?
I wish I could tell you not to be, but I can't. why wasn't that man with the leopard afraid of Pazuzu?
I don't know.
- I'll try to find out.
- His name is Kokumo.
Kokumo...
If he can teach me how he has survived Pazuzu...
...l'll come back and let you know.
I must go to Africa right away!
If I can find this man Kokumo, it will prove...
...that the exorcisms were valid.
But more than that...
...remember how Merrin prophesied that new men would arise to purge evil?
They may already be among us.
Kokumo could be one of them.
I saw him in a vision.
I saw his power over evil.
I've asked you to investigate the exorcisms of Father Merrin...
...not to step into his shoes.
You are in dire need of prayer.
- I suggest you make a retreat!
- Why not an advance?
Lamont, you are in open defiance of the church! I beg you to reconsider!
I have no choice but to relieve you of your assignment.
You will refrain from any further action. we'll speak again after your retreat.
Thank you.
I am in mortal sin...
...disobedience, pride...
...but evil overwhelms us!
I had to disobey!
I had to disobey! where is she?
She's on the roof. She's always there.
I can't lock her up.
- I wish you'd help Father Lamont.
- What do you mean?
He needs your help.
How can I help him? I don't know how.
Yes, you do.
Regan, what are you talking about? well, you know. Going into synch, trying to reach him like that.
But you told me he's in Africa. when you're in synch, it's different.
I mean, it doesn't matter where you are.
You can find them.
You know...
...help them.
Is that why you haven't been coming to see me?
- Because I won't let you go into synch?
- Yes.
I can't.
I have to do what I think is best for you.
Is there anyone who would remember
Father Merrin?
Perhaps the abbot. I can ask him.
He knew Father Merrin.
He says he was very holy.
Did he know Kokumo?
Merrin came up here once with a boy who was very sick.
There was an accident.
A wind, what do you say...?
A devil wind.
And a monk fell to his death.
The big wind raised much dust, and the body was never found.
They searched all over, everywhere.
He didn't fall there. He bounced on that ledge and fell there.
I'll show you!
Be careful! wait! Wait for me! over there!
In the cleft of that rock over there.
- How did you know the body was here?
- He was killed by the demon Pazuzu!
I flew with Pazuzu in a trance!
It's difficult to explain.
I was under hypnosis.
No, Father! Please wait!
Stop, Father, wait!
Father!
Please!
No!
Father Abbot! Listen to me!
He will not speak to a devil-worshiper!
I am not a devil-worshiper!
Please don't drug me.
Don't put me under, Gene.
I'm okay now.
- It'll make you sleep.
- But it will stop me from dreaming.
Maybe that will be good for a while.
But he needs me.
I've got to find him.
You'll be fine. You'll be just fine.
You're trying to kill my...
My soul.
A Muslim city with mud walls, golden.
Mud city with golden walls?
Sounds like Jepti.
- You know it?
- I know every holy place in Africa.
Religion's my business.
Plastic saints, icons,
Buddhas, voodoo gris-gris...
Edwards is my name.
Ecumenical Edwards, they call me.
Philip Lamont, archaeologist.
It's nice to know you, Father. what now?
Locusts!
Spraying for locusts!
This is the traditional route of the plague!
They think they can stop them with DDT!
- I've flown this route before!
- When was that?
It was...
It was on the wings of a demon!
Did he take you to Jepti?
Yes, he did.
Almighty God...
...help me.
I must find Kokumo.
I have resisted.
I have not called on Pazuzu.
Help me. call me.
Regan. call me by my dream name. call me.
Pazuzu, prince of the evil spirits of the air, take me to Kokumo.
I call upon you in the name of Father Lankester Merrin.
How did you find me?
I saw you in the mind of a girl who was possessed by Pazuzu.
- She is still in danger of dreams.
- How can I help her? which girl would you help?
The one possessed by Pazuzu or the one held by Father Merrin?
You must pluck out her evil heart...
...but Pazuzu has brushed you with his wings.
You called on Pazuzu to reach me.
You've lost faith in your God.
You do not believe.
I do believe! I'll do anything to help Regan! Anything!
Then prove your faith. Cross over.
My faith is in Jesus christ, reborn.
Prove it. Cross over!
Step out of your despair.
If Pazuzu comes for you,
I will spit a leopard. can I help you?
I fell. I failed!
The heat, perhaps. come inside, it's cooler.
- Who are you?
- My name is Kokumo.
- Did you know Father Lankester Merrin?
- Yes. when I was young, in Ethiopia. wonderful man.
He died while exorcising the demon Pazuzu from a young girl.
- Were you ever...?
- Possessed by Pazuzu?
That's what my mother used to tell me.
- Locusts?
- Yes!
Let me show you!
This is one of the main control stations in equatorial Africa.
The key factor is the brushing of the wings. when it is dry...
...the grasshoppers go their own way, happy individuals. when a heavy rain hatches them in large numbers...
...they crowd together.
Their wings brush against each other.
The agitation transforms them.
Here, you see them in their various forms.
Most importantly, the brushing of the wings changes their personality.
They become a destructive, voracious, marauding swarm, with a single mind.
A locust mind, if you will.
The evil swarm sweeps over the earth, possessing all that it touches.
Evil breeding evil by contact.
Is there no hope once the wings have brushed you? we try. with the help of science.
Look at this young female.
She has been evolved to resist the brushing of the wings.
At least, that is our hope. we like to call her the Good Locust.
Her children will be our agents in the swarm.
Breaking the chain reaction.
Remaining forever happy-go-lucky grasshoppers.
Let us pray it succeeds.
The Good Locust?
- Where do you think you're going?
- It's okay.
I can't get you out of the bath. oh, I lost the soap!
You got me all wet! call back tomorrow.
You got me all wet, look!
Hello? when?
Does Dr. Tuskin know? well, where is the doctor?
Hold on, that could be Regan.
You!
It's all your fault.
Regan's sick. You stirred it up.
She's left the hospital.
God knows where she is!
- I have to see her.
- You have some nerve!
Please. I can help her. only I can help her...
Leave us alone! we don't wanna hear about demons or God or anything!
Just get out of here!
They put you in a hospital.
Dr. Tuskin doesn't understand.
- Did you find the man with the leopard?
- I did.
Did he tell you how to fight Pazuzu?
He told me...
...good and evil are struggling within you. we must fight it.
I brought this with me.
The synchronizer? why don't you phone the police?
No.
Gary? Linda?
Get your things.
I'll drop you at Miss Billing's.
That's no fair, Mom.
- I know, but I have to.
- What are you gonna do?
Find her myself.
And him too.
- Do you remember Sandra?
- Yes.
She's still talking.
You have a great gift.
Keep it from evil.
Pazuzu will brush me with his wings.
Don't be afraid.
Father Merrin will help us.
All right, Regan.
I'm ready. Bring me down.
He is with me. come down.
Down, Father.
To meet me.
You're dying, Merrin, dying!
And your hopes die with you!
Not oniy Kokumo, but others iike him, began to appear in the worid.
I found them where I couid...
...and tried to protect them against evii.
So Satan has sent Pazuzu to destroy this goodness. why me?
I heal the sick.
Phiiip, you must take my piace.
She is precious, and I entrust her to you.
Father? what's...?
Father, wait!
Father, where are you going?
- Why would they come here?
- The synchronizer.
- It's gone! She's way ahead of us.
- I know she is.
- Any news?
- Regan's taken the synchronizer.
See me.
Please, see me.
Gene, it's her. Line two.
- Regan?
- Gene, look, I took the synchronizer.
I'm sorry, but I had to. I needed it.
I left it at the Dixie Hotel, room 27.
- Where are you?
- Penn Station.
- Is he with you?
- Yes.
He's going to Washington, isn't he?
To the house?
Regan, don't go with him.
I have to. It's my fault.
He's doing it for me.
Regan, iisten to me.
You're in terribie danger.
Gene, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Bye. where is she?
Penn Station.
Hey, stop that!
Stupid bitch!
- Where are you going?
- Washington.
- I'm going with you.
- Call my kids. I'll be in touch.
Father, tickets!
Do you have any money?
No, I'm with him! He's sick.
They... They gave him an injection.
Leave her alone. She belongs to me!
It's an accident.
Doctor!
I need a doctor!
Drive on. Someone must have called an ambulance. well, Regan can wait, I guess. wait! I'm a doctor. I'll help you.
Let me see.
Hold still.
The power.
It's getting nearer. can't you feel it?
The power is immense. It fills me.
I can do anything.
Gene...
You called Gene, didn't you?
Father, please don't be lost to me.
- Why don't you loosen your tie?
- Thank you. why are you looking at me like that?
The power.
I must take you there.
Did Kokumo tell you that?
He said...
...the Good Locust...
- We'll get a taxi. Quick, hurry!
- Yes.
Taxi! Taxi!
- There's one!
- Hey, lady!
Lady, that's my taxi!
Animals!
- Sorry about that.
- People! where to?
Give him the address.
Georgetown. 8 Prospect Street.
- 8 Prospect Street?
- Yes! Come on, let's go!
Get going! The girl has to get home! what now?
I'm gonna see about this!
- It won't do no good.
- She's a doctor.
- No difference. This is washington.
- Someone's dying.
Father, no!
Father, wait!
Driver, please hurry! come on!
This is Prospect Street now.
There's the house.
I can't control it!
It's going crazy! oh, my God!
Let me reach you.
Sharon?
Get me out of here!
Help me! we've got to help Regan!
At least help Regan!
- To do what?
- To fight this thing!
Name it.
Pazuzu.
I've got to get inside.
Let me inside!
Regan...
No! Father Lamont, help me!
Kokumo! Remember Father Merrin?
No!
He's mine. He's chosen me.
Pazuzu's Regan is the only Regan!
Be joined with us, Father.
Please.
Kill her.
The wings. The wings are brushing me!
The wings are brushing me!
I must! I must! we like to call her the Good Locust.
She was evolved to resist the brushing of the wings.
No! Once the wings have brushed you, you're mine forever!
She will break the chain reaction.
Kill her! We command you! why me? Why me?
You must tear out her evil heart.
Pazuzu!
Help!
Help! Help, somebody!
Help me, somebody! Help me!
I...
...chose...
...evil.
No.
Sharon, your hunger for belief was your truth.
The time has come.
Now we are saved and made strong.
The enemy of the human race...
...is subdued.
I'm sorry.
I understand now.
The world won't.
Not yet.
You have to go.
Take care of her.
- What happened?
- Oh, my God! How awful!
In God's name, what happened?
- Was anybody in the building?
- Gangway, please.
You witnessed what went on here? was anyone inside?
Lady, are you okay?
Okay. Hold it.
Is it all right if we get back to work now?
Thanks awfully. Sorry to be such a bore.
Not at all, Lady Charlotte.
It's rather fun.
Mr. Graham.
Hogan, your job is to look after the amphib, not lug that stuff around.
Well, one of us has to be nice to the lady, major.
Plucky little woman. Bit of a responsibility on a trip like this, though.
Didn't have a choice, Captain.
We agreed to take a reporter from the newspaper that financed us.
- They sent her.
- Be fair, Ben, she does take good pictures.
Maybe. But she's one problem
I could do without.
If the weather holds, we should reach the last known position of your friend Tyler in 3 days.
At which point, we should sight the coastline of this mysterious ice continent he describes in his log.
You sound as though you still have your doubts, Captain.
If we did, major, The Royal Navy wouldn't be helping you.
No, it was the specimens that Tyler included in this canister.
And when Dr. Norfolk here, confirmed that they were genuine...
Why do you think
I went to the top man in Europe?
Oh, now, hardly, Ben.
Dr. Schenkelman in Vienna...
Oh, come on, doctor.
If it hadn't been for your word,
The London Times would never have agreed to back this expedition, and you know it.
I don't think I'll ever forget the day when Major Ben McBride walked into my room at the Natural
History Museum with that canister.
- Almost spilled your hot milk, didn't you?
- It was quite a moment, Ben.
Tyler makes it sound a very dangerous place.
A continent full of cavemen and dinosaurs?
Do you really believe there's a chance that Tyler may still be alive?
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
Doc knows where I stand.
- I don't give a damn about dinosaurs.
- I'm still hoping to convert him.
Boy, I'm sure glad we're going in by air, major.
Me, too, Hogan.
I'd hate to have to climb that.
I'd say it was almost impossible.
And I'm quite good at this sort of thing.
- Did I ever tell you about the Matterhorn?
- Once or twice.
- Just how long have we got, Captain?
- 3 to 4 weeks. Half what we planned, but we hadn't expected so much pack ice.
If it closes in on us...
Come on, Captain. This ship is built like the rock of Gibraltar.
It may be, Mr. Hogan, but that ice could crush this hull like a matchbox.
- And if that happened...
- There'll be no trip home for any of us.
Okay, Hogan, let's winch the amphibian into the water.
The sooner we get airborne, the better.
- Hogan!
- Okay, let's go.
McBride to Polar Queen, flying southwest. Altitude 3,000 feet.
Still no breaks in the ice.
Turning southeast, and climbing at 5,000 feet. Over.
Roger. Polar Queen listening. Over.
McBride to Polar Queen, still no break in the ice wall.
Course south by southwest. Over.
Polar Queen to McBride, your signal is badly distorted.
What is your present course? Over.
Can't give you...
Polar Queen to McBride, Say again. Over.
Mainly static for the last 2 hours, sir, but they're still transmitting, and I think they're still airborne.
At least they're alive.
And they've flown over 200 miles.
Must be well over the ice wall by now.
Hey, what the...
It's a pterodactyl!
Absolutely magnificent!
Coming in on the starboard, major!
Here he comes. Look at the size!
Look out! He's close!
Hogan!
Right.
Coming in at port, major.
Hold on! This may be a little rough.
- I'll try to smooth out the bumps next time.
- Nonsense. You did extremely well.
- Still in one piece?
- Just. How about the plane?
- Hogan?
- Yeah.
- What kind of shape we in?
- Well, not good. But it's fixable.
McBride to Polar Queen, can you read me? Over.
Polar Queen to McBride, your signal's very faint. Go ahead.
We have been attacked by a giant pterodactyl.
Good Lord!
Damage to amphib... had to make forced landing...
Polar Queen to McBride, this is Captain Lawton.
How bad is damage to plane?
McBride to Polar Queen, acknowledge my message. Over.
I say again, how bad is damage to plane?
- No dice?
- It's hard to tell.
- Not much they could do anyway.
- Well, if they sail away, we're sunk.
Nobody's gonna sail away, Hogan.
There's plenty of time for everything.
- Any luck, Mr. Graham?
- No, sir. They've stopped transmitting.
Will they get that plane back into the air?
There's no way we can send a rescue party in over those cliffs.
- What the devil are we going to do, sir?
- We're going to wait, Mr. Whitby.
We shall chart this section of the coastline, and we shall stay here as long as we can.
- Mount a 24-hour listening watch, Mr. Graham?
- Aye, aye, sir.
But supposing the ice closes in, sir.
Let me worry about that, will you,
Mr. Whitby? Start work on the charts, please.
Aye, aye, sir!
Ready... heave!
Ready... heave!
Okay. Let's take 5.
What we really need is a winch.
- Yeah, well, we haven't got one.
- You know, what we really need is a winch.
Yeah.
We must remember to bring one next time.
Go easy on that stuff, Hogan.
It's just a little "nerve tonic," major.
The war, remember?
- Well, this isn't the western front.
- You're absolutely right. It's worse.
No, no, believe me. I was there.
Pterodactyls are far more interesting than Germans.
Interesting?
Doc, you professor types are all the same.
Pterodactyls?
You give me the Red Baron any day.
Anyway, all I want to do Is fix up that amphibian and get us the hell out of here.
What are you talking about?
We just started.
We came here to get Tyler, and that's what we're going to do.
You better call in the Navy, because we are going to need some reinforcements.
You worry too much, Hogan.
Get that prop fixed and check out the tail.
- How's it going?
- Oh, quite well, thank you.
Oh, could I have a photograph of you?
Well, yeah.
Where do you want me?
That rock will do fine.
Makes a good background.
Right.
Okay.
Hold it.
I think McBride's found something you might like to look at.
Really?
You're a real barrel of laughs, you know it?
A fully grown stegosaurus.
Now, isn't that absolutely beautiful?
I hope you appreciate this moment, Ben.
Aren't they supposed to be very docile and very stupid?
- Well, in theory, yes.
- Especially the female of the species.
You know, I've got a feeling we've just found our winch.
Why don't we use him to tow the amphib out?
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
It looks big enough.
But suppose he doesn't want to.
All we've got to do is tie a rope to his tail and make him run away.
- They should make a good anchor point.
- Yeah.
- Is he going to feel this?
- No, not yet.
His nervous system works about 100 times slower than ours.
I hope you're right.
Hogan!
- Ready?
- Hold onto your hat.
Hey! Charly!
Get the hell out of the way, goddamn it!
Keep your shirt on.
Go on! Go on!
Go on!
Go!
She's clear!
Now, how are we going to stop it?
Major!
Attaboy, major!
Come on, major!
I'm going for the rocks!
Major!
Oh, boy.
Isn't it marvelous? It worked!
You almost got yourself killed.
Listen, your family's newspaper may be paying for this trip, but from now on, just quit clowning around. Understand?
Come on. Now, don't get sore at the major.
Look, I was with him for three years in France. He's all right.
He's just a little worried about what he's got us into, you being a lady and all.
You promised to forget that, remember?
As for McBride, don't worry,
I can look after myself.
I'm going to have to cut about 10 inches off each of those blades to balance them off.
Then we're going to lose a lot of thrust.
Will it get us in the air?
If none of us has too big a breakfast, yes.
How long do you figure it'll take?
Well, with the rudder and all the other items, it's going to be... it's going to be about 3 or 4 days.
Can't afford to lose that much time.
- You two game to go in on foot?
- Yes!
- Yes.
- You're crazy!
For all we know, Tyler could be sitting just on the other side of these hills.
We get up to that ridge, we may be able to see some of those peaks he described.
We'll be heading due south.
In 3 days time, I'll send up a flare, at 9:00 in the morning and 3:00 in the afternoon.
We could be back before you're through here.
- What about the goddamn monsters?
- Trust me.
I looked after you in France, didn't I?
The way I remember it,
I was the one who saved your life.
That's what I mean, Hogan.
I owe you one, right?
Right.
Well, let's get started.
You still annoyed at having to bring me along?
No, not really. It's just that certain kinds of girls are hard to take.
Oh, you mean my kind?
Well, the world's a changing place, McBride.
You know what the real problem is?
You just can't stand competition.
Lady, I believe in a man doing a man's work, that's all.
- What is it, doc?
- It can only be one thing... prehistoric.
Definitely prehistoric.
That's human.
Ben!
- You hurt?
- No. Thanks.
A genuine cavegirl.
She'll suit you perfectly.
She's all yours, doc. You're the expert.
In fossils, perhaps.
This is a little outside my field.
Don't touch!
She speaks English.
- That's crazy.
- No, it doesn't make sense.
Ben. See this knife she's carrying?
It's a Bowie knife.
I don't know how the hell she got it.
Well, yes, she must have been in contact with Tyler.
- Tyler.
- Good God! She knows the name.
What is your name?
Ajor.
Ajor, listen, did Tyler teach you to speak our language?
Yes. He teach you, too?
No. Tyler and me learned together.
Grow up together.
Tyler is a friend of mine.
I guess he's a friend of yours, too?
Was good man... all gone.
Gone now.
Ajor has no friends.
- No people.
- Pull that photograph of Tyler.
Ajor...
Look.
Go on... take it.
Your friend Tyler seems to have made quite an impression.
Why don't you... go and light a fire or something?
Right, I've got the whole story.
She comes from a race of people called the Galu.
It's a Stone Age tribe, or at least it was when Tyler and a girl called Lisa stumbled into one of their settlements.
Lisa, wasn't that the girl that Tyler rescued?
That's right. The only other survivor of the original party.
Go on.
Well, it appears that Tyler and the girl were welcomed by the Galu
- and lived with them for more than 2 years.
- I'm glad somebody's friendly.
During that time, they taught the Galu farming skills, generally helped them advance from the Stone Age into the Iron Age.
Why is she so upset over Tyler's picture?
Because another more advanced race, called the Naga, didn't like the competition.
They massacred every Galu they could lay their hands on.
Is... Tyler dead?
Well, there's a chance that Tyler and Lisa may have been captured.
The Nagas usually sacrifice their prisoners to appease their volcano god.
Well, in this case, it would make more sense to keep them alive.
Their knowledge would help the advance of the Nagas.
Well, I hope not.
They sound a pretty vile bunch.
Ajor was one of the few Galus to escape.
And she's been on the run ever since.
- When did all this happen?
- About 4 months ago.
Then there's a good chance that Tyler may still be alive.
Can Ajor take us to where the Nagas live?
Goddamn it, another one. I told you...
I told you what I was going to do.
I told you.
Don't these things ever sleep?
The island never sleeps.
Here.
Take it away! Take it away! Take it away!
Oh, God!
- That's a big one.
- Oh, that's a beauty!
That's a Poecilotheria fasciata.
It's not funny!
I don't believe it, Charly.
I thought nothing could faze you.
Hairy plane ride, Ajor's friend in the forest, you took them on without blinking an eye.
- And along comes this little spider...
- Little?
It was cute.
It was kind of cuddly, too, wasn't it?
Now, stop it.
You're making my flesh creep.
At least it proves you're human.
Well, everyone has their breaking point, McBride.
With me, it's spiders.
With you... it's me.
- What is it?
- Band-lu.
- A hunting party?
- I hope they're not hunting us.
In that case,
I shall try and get a picture.
Hold it.
Galu! Galu!
Flare pistol.
Ajor, no!
His name is Mikay.
He was good friend of Tyler.
Did he have time to say anything about Tyler?
He was taken with many others to mountain of skulls, the city where the Nagas live.
- Can you take us there?
- Yes. But it's hopeless.
Even if you can get in, you can never escape Nagoramata.
- Who's he?
- The volcano god of the Nagas.
He rules the land.
No one can go against his will and live.
- Where's Ajor going?
- She's looking for the entrance to a cave.
If she finds it, it'll make life a lot easier.
We'd be crazy to go over the top if there's a shortcut.
Ben!
Get out of here!
You bounder!
Leave me! Leave me!
He's awake.
Ben? Ben, can you hear me?
Norfolk, Charly, you all right?
We thought you were dead.
Where are we?
At the entrance of the Band-lu camp, behind you, up the slope.
Any idea what they plan to do with us?
I think we're some sort of offering.
These stakes were in the ground when we got here.
You mean a sacrificial offering?
No.
No, not religious.
Something more practical.
Somebody's dinner then?
Sorry, Charly.
You're okay, you know that?
I think it's better not to talk.
Some of them hunt by sound, rather than smell.
Oh, good girl, my notes.
I get for you. Band-lu not see.
Great. No gun, no ammunition.
God knows what we'll do if they follow us.
They won't. They're afraid to cross over the boundary.
Hogan to Polar Queen.
Hogan to Polar Queen.
Look, I can't hear you. I just hope you're still out there, all right?
Our repairs to the plane are just about finished. I still have to test-fly the ship.
If she checks out all right, then I'm going to look out for the major.
From what I've seen of this place, there's going to be a problem in trying to find somewhere to land.
Anyway, the deal is, if they're not back after 3 weeks, I fly out on my own.
So don't you go on off without me, you hear?
Some deal.
Anyway, it's nice talking to you.
This is Hogan. Out.
What do you think of it, Norfolk?
Absolutely remarkable!
Do you think it's safe?
There's only one way to find out...
Keep moving.
Charly.
Come on! That's it, that's it!
Okay, baby, don't you let me down!
Okay, let her go! Move it up!
This is the country of the Nagas.
- Looks pretty grim.
- So are the Nagas.
It's 9:00. Time to put up a flare.
Nagas!
Welcome.
You are surprised I speak your tongue.
Your friend Tyler, he has taught us much already.
- We heard he was a prisoner.
- And you came to rescue him?
Did that creature fill you with these lies?
Tyler's a man of great power who honors us with his presence.
It is he who sent me to welcome you. Come with me.
I can't believe Tyler talking these guys around.
- Well, you always said he was a survivor.
- Yeah, but how did he know we were coming?
Good question. Unfortunately, we have to visit the mountain of skulls to learn the answer.
Goddamn it! When I put you together, you stay together!
Oh, no!
No, no, I haven't heard from the major yet.
Should be back any day now.
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?
Okay, Hogan. Over and out.
Hogan? Yeah?
If I don't get out of here, you're gonna go bananas.
Yeah.
- I thought you were going to see Tyler.
- So did I.
Hold your tongue! Only Sabbala speaks.
Take your hands off me!
Let me go.
Let me go!
Nagoramata.
Good fortune smiles upon you.
Soon you will become brides of Nagoramata.
Ben?
- Ben McBride!
- Bowen!
No... it's not possible!
Yes, it's me.
- It's Tyler, he's right next door.
- Wonderful!
You son of a gun, we'd almost given up hope of finding you.
Yes, we had a rough time getting here.
Anyway, thank goodness we found you.
- You mean, you came here to find me?
- Sure. We got the message from the canister.
Yeah, it was picked up off the coast of Scotland at the end of 1917.
Oh, my name is Edwin Norfolk, by the way.
Good to meet you, sir.
Ben.
Sabbala say,
"soon your bodies will feel warmth
"of Nagoramata's love.
Your heads will help build new temple
"in his honor."
Did he say when?
At the rising of his sister... the sun.
Ben.
I...
- I'd given up hope.
- Yeah, I know. Me, too.
My folks, Ben, how are they?
Your ma and pa are both fine.
In fact, it was your pa that got me into this thing.
He hasn't changed much, has he?
It didn't take much persuading.
Ben... the war?
It's over, Bo. There'll be plenty of time to talk about that.
Right now, the girls who came with us are in trouble.
Girls?
- Sabbala?
- Yeah, and he looks like bad news.
He is.
Well, in that case, we haven't got a moment to waste.
One of the girls is a friend of yours... Ajor.
Ajor, the Galu?
Yeah. I'll explain later.
Where have they got Lisa?
She's dead.
Sabbala killed her.
We wouldn't cooperate with the Nagas.
Looks as though they gave you a pretty rough time.
They smashed 2 years of hard work.
Wiped out a whole race of people.
Sacrificed Lisa to the volcano.
No!
Ben, my stick.
Barricade the door.
Nagoramata! When he speaks, all die!
Ben, we gotta go down here.
It's the only way.
- My camera!
- Forget it.
No, look, it's just in there.
Along with your notes.
- Yes, yes, I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Norfolk!
Norfolk!
Hurry!
Stay where you are!
Wait till they settle down.
- Charly, this is no time for pictures.
- Shut up and help.
Okay, now, you've got to wind that up there, underneath.
And that sets it off there, but don't forget to close your eyes.
Get set to run on the count of 3.
Ben... you go on ahead. I'll slow 'em down.
Give you a chance to get through that cave.
How you gonna stop 'em? With rocks?
No dice, Bo. I didn't come all this way to leave you behind.
What the hell, Ben?
I buy it here or I buy it later.
We may get away from the Nagas, but we'll never get home.
Once we get to that amphib, we're home and dry.
The land'll stop you, Ben. It's alive.
That volcano is its heart.
It controls everything.
- How can the land be alive?
- Ask Ajor if we can get out of here.
Only wish I had something to hold them off with.
Here, take this.
And this spare magazine.
- Move! Norfolk!
- Go on.
Go on!
In! Go in!
Bo!
- Stupid, goddamn stunt.
- No!
Easy.
Remember...
- when we were kids, Ben?
- Yeah.
I always wanted to play the hero.
Easy.
Only then... arrows weren't real.
- Easy.
- Ben...
I told you... there's... there's no escape.
Goddamn it.
Where's Tyler?
Ajor!
Hogan calling Polar Queen.
Hogan calling Polar Queen!
Are you receiving me?
Come on! Get off!
Oh, no!
Come on! Steady.
Dirty old nag!
Come on!
Get out of it!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Let go! Help! Let go!
Ajor, get back! Get back!
Move!
Ben!
Get out of here! Get out of here!
Go on!
We've got to move now, sir.
If those icebergs close in...
Very well, Mr. Whitby.
Get her underway, will you?
We'll move back 5 miles. Be ready to transmit our position in case they make contact.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Engine room, prepare to get underway.
- You okay?
- Oh, just.
I didn't believe what Tyler said about this island.
- I'm beginning to think he was right.
- It's a complete and utter disaster.
Come on, it's not as bad as that.
We're doing okay.
I'm not talking about that.
I've lost my satchel in there.
All my notes and everything!
Don't worry. I've still got my camera.
Boatswain reports channel clear, sir.
- Very good, Mr. Whitby. Keep her moving.
- Very good, sir.
Band-lu. Make them go away with fire gun.
- I've run out of flares. How about you, Ben?
- Three shots left.
For heaven's sake, I'm sick and tired of running away from those dreadful people.
Get up.
Get going, Charly. Otherwise I'll kick your butt from here to the plane.
You'd never be a major in the British army.
Goddamn it, major, where the hell are you?
- Anything at all, Mr. Graham?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
Keep transmitting our position. And let them know we're moving out in the morning.
I'll be damned! Major!
Come on!
Okay, let's move it.
Come on!
- You didn't get Tyler?
- No, but I brought you a present.
- Got any of that "nerve tonic" left?
- Yeah, I sure have.
You cut it pretty fine, major.
I was worried this whole place was going to shake apart before you got back here.
It's about to.
We're being followed by a volcano.
Yeah... what?
Ajor, don't worry.
Everything'll be all right.
We've lost a lot of thrust on that cut-down prop, major.
You'll have to open her right up on the chocks or we'll never get out of here!
Hogan!
All clear! Let's go, major!
She won't climb any higher.
We have to lighten the ship.
Norfolk, throw out everything you can!
It's our only hope. Out!
My camera! My camera!
Major! We did it!
McBride to Polar Queen. McBride to
Polar Queen, how do you read me? Over.
What the devil's going on?
Any luck, major?
The ship! The ship!
Great going!
Look, sir!
It's them! The amphib!
He has no power.
By God, they've made it!
- Muster rescue party.
- Very good, sir.
"Congratulations on incredible escape.
Safe voyage home."
May I also add my congratulations to that?
And also, for...
Mr. Graham, you... and also for bringing back such a charming souvenir.
Oh, yes, sir. It's all rather fun.
Why, that's not bad.
That's not bad at all.
You know, I can't wait to walk you down the main street of North Flats, Nebraska.
Nebraska? No volcanoes?
No, but they're sure gonna explode when they see you.
You know, Hogan, this is rather like your "nerve tonic."
Professor, have some of the real thing.
Thank you.
That makes life look a lot rosier.
You know, my uncle will have a heart attack when we get back empty-handed.
In fact, he'll probably fire me.
Maybe you weren't meant to make your name in pictures.
- Got any other ideas?
- I'll think of something.
- Charly?
- Yes?
Why didn't you tell me about that gun you had stashed in your camera case?
I was keeping it in case we got into a jam.
Long ago...
... in the early years of the Second Age...
... the great Elven-smiths
forged Rings of Power.
Nine for mortal Men.
Seven for the Dwarf-lords.
Three for the tall Elf-kings.
But then, the Dark Lord learned
the craft of ring-making...
... and made the Master Ring.
The One Ring to rule them all.
With the One Ring, Middle-earth is his
and he cannot be overcome.
As the last alliance of Men and Elves
fell beneath his power...
... he did not notice the heroic shadow
who slipped in.
It was Prince Isildur...
... of the mighty kings from across the sea...
... who took the Ring.
But because he did not destroy it,
the spirit of the Dark Lord lived on...
... and began to take shape and grow again.
But the Ring had a will of its own,
and a way of slipping from one hand...
... to be found by another, so that it
might at last get back to its master.
And there the Ring lay,
at the bottom of the Great River Anduin...
... for thousands of years.
During those years...
... the Dark Lord captured the nine Rings
that were made for Men...
... and turned their owners
into the Ringwraiths:
Terrible shadows under his great shadow...
... who roamed the world,
searching for the One Ring.
In time, the Ring was found.
Two friends were fishing
in the Great River one day.
- Give us that, Déagol, my love.
- Why, Sméagol?
Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it.
I have already given you more than I could afford.
I found this, and I'm going to keep it!
Are you indeed, my love?
He used the Ring for thieving,
and to find out secrets.
His own people began to despise
the wretched creature...
... and to call him Gollum.
Tortured and driven by the Ring,
he hid in dark caves...
... under deep mountains.
But the Ring
slipped off Gollum's finger, too.
And so it was that Bilbo found it,
during his travels with the Dwarves.
Thief, Baggins. Thief!
It stole our precious, our precious...
Our birthday present.
Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!
It was Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit...
... who took the Ring back to the Shire,
his home.
Years later...
... Gandalf the Wizard, visited Bilbo
on his going-away birthday party.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
Frodo, I can see your uncle Bilbo hasn't changed much.
And though 111 years is far too short a time...
...to live among such admirable Bagginses and Boffinses, Grubbs...
...Chubbs, Brace-girdles, Goodbodies...
...Bolgers, Hornblowers and Proudfoots...
- Proudfeet!
...I regret to announce that this is the end.
I'm going away. I'm leaving. Now.
Goodbye.
Where did he go?
Oh, Gandalf.
Have you left the Ring for Frodo, as we agreed?
It's mine, I tell you! It's my own.
My precious!
It's mine now, and I shall keep it.
I won't give my precious away, I tell you.
Do not say that again!
Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.
All right, I will.
Seventeen years passed sleepily
in the Shire.
All right, just a minute!
Gandalf!
Greetings, Frodo.
Gandalf, it's really you!
Oh, it's been so long!
Seventeen years...
...since Bilbo left.
You look the same as ever, Frodo.
You look older, Gandalf.
Oh, I've been on a long journey.
It's the Ring, isn't it?
Bilbo's funny magic ring.
You always used to look like that when you talked about it.
Bilbo's "funny" ring, that makes you invisible?
- Give it to me, Frodo!
- Give you the Ring?
For a moment only.
Can you see any markings on it?
There are none.
It's quite a plain ring, really.
Well, then, look!
Wait. Do you desire it so much already?
No, but why ruin it?
Because it is altogether evil.
It will corrupt and destroy anyone who wears it...
...until he passes into the World of Shadows...
...under the power of Sauron:
The Dark Lord of Mordor!
Not Bilbo?
You are the one who has the Ring now.
- It's not even warm.
- No.
Not even a dragon's fire could harm that Ring.
"One Ring to rule them all
"One Ring to find them
"One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them"
I wish it need not have happened in my time.
So do I.
The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength of knowledge...
...to break all resistance, and cover all the lands in darkness.
He lacks the One Ring.
Maybe he doesn't know that it was found.
He knows, Frodo.
Gollum left his cave to follow the Ring himself...
...and the Dark Lord caught him in Mordor.
The Dark Lord knows what ring it was
Gollum found, and how he lost it again.
And he has heard of Hobbits at last, and of the Shire.
And he even has a name to think about...
...the name of Baggins.
Because of Gollum!
Oh, Gandalf, what am I to do?
What a pity that Bilbo didn't kill that vile creature when he had the chance!
Yes, it was pity.
Pity and mercy.
And now, Frodo, the decision lies with you.
What will you do with the One Ring?
I'll give it to you, Gandalf!
You're wise and powerful.
Well, will you not...
No! Do not tempt me.
I would wish to turn it to good, and it cannot be used so.
Meaning to be kind, I would become as terrible as the Dark Lord himself.
Do not tempt me!
I shall have such need of strength so soon.
Then I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it.
I ought to go away somewhere, alone.
But they won't bother the Shire if the Ring isn't here.
My dear Frodo...
...I am afraid you are right.
You'll have to go and leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is no longer safe.
Your new traveling name shall be:
Mr. Underhill.
What have you heard, and why did you listen?
Mr. Frodo, sir, don't let him hurt me, sir!
Don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.
Well?
Answer him, Sam.
Well, I heard a deal that I didn't rightly understand...
...about an enemy and rings, and about Elves, sir.
Why, I would dearly love to see Elves,
Mr. Frodo.
And so you shall, Sam.
So you shall. Indeed, you should go to the Elves first, to Rivendell.
Tell everyone you are moving away...
...to live in Buckleberry, with those cousins of yours, Pippin and Merry.
However you manage it, do it soon, by your birthday at the latest.
I should be back by then.
I must go south, to consult with the Wizard Saruman...
...the head of my order. Be careful, Frodo.
Me, go, sir? Me, go and see the Elves?
Oh, my! Hooray!
I have come for your aid,
Saruman the White, in troubled times.
The Nine are abroad.
Darkness approaches, the Black Riders!
Is that all the news you have for me then?
Is that not enough?
Sauron is moving at last!
We can deal with Sauron ourselves.
You and I, one way or another.
What talk is this?
What are you saying, Saruman?
It is time for us to choose.
A new age is upon us.
A new power is rising.
Nothing that Men or Elves or Wizards can do will avail against it.
Its enemies are utterly doomed, but its friends...
You are saying that we should join with Mordor?
With him?
Does that displease you?
Where is the Ring, Gandalf?
Why do the Black Riders search for it in the Shire?
Have you hidden it there?
Would you rather see the Dark Lord have it...
...or Saruman of many colors?
Neither of you will have it.
There is a third choice.
It is to remain here...
...until you tell me where the Ring may be found.
Saruman, if you do this...
...if you delay me here,
Sauron will surely get it then.
Then he will know his good servants...
...and his enemies.
Saruman!
Saruman!
I don't feel right going off without Gandalf,
Mr. Frodo.
I wish we could've waited, that I do.
So do I, Sam, but he said to leave as soon as we could.
And Merry and Pippin insisted on coming with us, as far as Bree, for the fun of it.
There's someone coming up ahead,
Mr. Frodo. I can hear a horse.
Good. I'm tired of looking at my cousins all day.
I think we should get off the road.
I don't want to be seen leaving the Shire.
But it might be Gandalf.
Then we'll surprise him. Hurry!
We're going with you, Frodo.
With me?
But how do you... Sam.
- But you gave your word.
- They already knew so much, Mr. Frodo.
Sam didn't tell us about the Ring, Frodo.
I saw Bilbo use it once, before he left, to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses.
And after that,
Pippin and I kept on the lookout...
...and we followed you.
We asked questions everywhere.
And we even wormed a few things out of Gandalf.
And you spied on me.
And Sam helped you.
And we spied on you.
But we meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo.
Don't you remember what Mr. Gandalf said?
"Take someone you can trust," he said.
- It doesn't seem that I can trust anyone.
- It all depends on what you want.
You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin, to the bitter end.
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone...
...and go off without a word.
We're your friends, Frodo.
Bless you, you deceitful scoundrels.
Hooray!
Will we be stopping at Bree tonight,
Mr. Frodo?
I think so, Sam.
We all need a fireside and a bath, and a proper night's sleep in a real bed.
I do wish Gandalf were with us.
Maybe he'll be at the inn when we get there.
Maybe.
I think I'll go out for a sniff of air.
Mind yourselves. Don't forget:
You're supposed to be escaping in secret.
Oh, mind yourself! Don't get lost.
Be careful, Merry.
Quiet!
Quiet, all!
We have some visitors with us tonight, all the way from the Shire.
What was your name again, sir?
Mr. Underhill.
Mr. Underhill and his party.
Yes, Mr. Underhill, sing us a Shire song!
Well, a short one, then.
"There is an inn, a merry old inn
Beneath an old gray hill
"And there they brew a beer so brown
"With a fol-de-doo and a fol-de-da
"Hobbits all of the Shire are we"
Who's there?
Who's there?
"With a ping and a pang
The fiddle-strings broke
"The cow jumped over the Moon"
Where did he go?
What's going on here?
Take your magic tricks back to the Shire!
What's this place coming to,
I'd like to know?
Well, Mr. Underhill...
...frightening my customers and breaking my crocks with your acrobatics!
Very sorry, it's quite unintentional, a most unfortunate accident.
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.
Who are you?
I am called Strider.
- Everyone knows me here.
- Well, we don't!
You've been very careless so far,
Mr. Frodo Baggins.
My name is Mr. Underhill.
After your performance tonight, it won't matter what you're called.
The Black Riders will know who you are by morning.
They already know what you bear.
Who are you really?
I am Gandalf's friend.
He asked me to watch out for you.
Gandalf? Have you seen him?
Where is he?
I do not know.
We were supposed to meet him here, but I've had no word, no message.
It is the first time that I've ever feared for him.
Then we will have to go on by ourselves tomorrow.
To Rivendell?
You'd never get there. The Black Riders are watching the road night and day.
They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place, where there's no help.
I know the wild country.
I can take you to Rivendell by paths that are seldom trodden.
Will you have me?
With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no.
This Strider, he says be more careful,
I say, let's start with him.
How do we know he's from Gandalf?
More likely, he's a playacting spy, working for...
- For them.
- I don't know, Sam.
I think one of the Enemy's servants would, well...
...seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.
While I look foul and feel fair, is that it?
Well, no, I meant...
Frodo!
Frodo, I've seen them!
I've seen them, Frodo!
I've seen them! Black Riders!
My men found him lying in the street.
There were two of them.
They were hissing to each other.
I seemed to be drawn towards them.
Well, you do need looking after, all of you.
There's been strange folk about for days.
That Ranger...
...Strider coming and going and... Strider!
- They've come from Mordor.
- Save us!
They won't trouble you once I am gone.
Strider came to offer me his help.
You know your own business, maybe...
...but in your place, I wouldn't take up with a ranger out of the wild.
They have no choice.
There is no one else for them except a fat innkeeper...
...who only remembers his name because people shout it at him all day!
I'll do what I can to help, Mr. Baggins.
Mr. Underhill.
I'm no hero, but I'll do what I can.
Keep watch tonight, you and your folk.
There is a hill called Weathertop...
...about half way between here and Rivendell.
We will make for it tomorrow.
So will Gandalf, if he can.
I still don't know if we can trust him,
Mr. Frodo.
I said, you have no choice, Sam.
Because, if I wanted the Ring for myself...
...I could have it, now.
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
If by life or death I can save you, I will.
How long will we be in these marshes, Aragorn?
At least two days.
I'm being eaten alive!
What do these things live on when they can't get Hobbits?
Easy there, Bill, easy, slow.
That is Weathertop.
We shall be there by nightfall, if we set a good pace and don't stop for lunch.
If this continues I'll become a wraith.
Don't speak of such things.
Aragorn! Aragorn!
And Beren was a mortal man...
...but Luthien Tinúviel was the daughter of a king of Elves...
...and she was the fairest maiden that has been among all the children of this world.
Yet she chose to be mortal, for him.
And when he died, she followed him.
And so he was her doom...
...but he was her love as well.
I thought I saw something!
Or maybe just shadows in the moonlight,
I don't know.
Just stand close to the fire. Make a circle.
What's that?
The Ring, Frodo! Take off the Ring!
Cold... It's so cold.
- Like a poisoned icicle.
- It is the cold of their world, Frodo.
When you put on the Ring, you entered the world of the Black Riders.
Gandalf said not to.
Why is it so misty here?
I can't see very well.
Well, what's the matter with him?
It was only a little wound.
It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam.
I think that a piece broke off in the wound and is working inward.
If it reaches his heart...
Can you do anything?
We must get to Rivendell very soon.
He can't go no further.
He must! Do you want them to take him?
Wait, listen.
Legolas!
Yes, Sam, that's an elf.
So, there has been no word of Gandalf in Rivendell? No message at all?
None.
My Lord Elrond has sent every rider he could spare to seek for you...
...knowing that you bore a great burden without guidance.
I have been on the road for nine days.
Well, Mr. Frodo has been on the road a lot longer than that.
And he's sick and he needs a rest.
Just for a while.
No resting can help your Mr. Frodo now.
Only the hands of Elrond in Rivendell can do that.
There are five Black Riders close behind us...
...and we may well find the other four waiting at the ford.
If we lose even a little time, we lose, Frodo, the Ring...
...and Middle-earth.
Do you understand me, Sam?
There is the ford of Rivendell.
Fly! The Enemy is upon us!
Come back. To Mordor we will take you.
Gandalf!
Come back, come back.
To Mordor we'll take you.
Come back, come back.
To Mordor, we'll take you.
Go back!
Run, you fool, run!
The Ring!
The Ring!
Go back to the land of Mordor, and follow me no more.
Come back. Come back.
To Mordor we will take you.
Come back. Come back.
Go back!
The Ring.
The Ring!
By all the Shire, you shall have neither the Ring nor me!
No, never. Verily, I come.
I give it unto you.
No, never! Gandalf!
Yes.
I am here, and you are lucky to be here, too...
...after all the absurd things you've done since you left home.
Where's Sam?
And are the others all right?
They've hardly left your side for three days.
Three days?
What happened at the ford?
It all seemed so dim, somehow.
You were beginning to fade, my remarkable friend.
The knifepoint had almost worked its way to your heart.
Oh, I didn't know. Would I have...
You would have become like them.
One of the Ringwraiths...
...the servants of the Dark Lord...
...if you had not resisted to the last.
The river, it rose up against them.
It is Elrond's river.
This is his house and it was Elrond himself who healed you.
If I may say so,
I added a few touches of my own.
The white horses and so on.
If you noticed.
Then that is the end of the Black Riders?
Not so long as the Ring itself exists.
They will fly back to their master in Mordor, empty and crippled...
...until they find new shapes to wear and new beasts to ride.
We have beaten them, just for a while, Frodo.
That's sort of a relief.
I wish that were the truth, Frodo.
I'm afraid we have a new and closer problem at hand.
You have not asked me why I was late getting back to the Shire.
I forgot.
When I was certain that yours was indeed the Master Ring...
... I rode at once to Isengard,
and I thought...
... that if anyone could know
what was best to do with the One Ring...
... it would surely be Saruman the White.
The great eagle, Gwaihir...
... came in answer to my call,
and bore me away.
Saruman has never paid enough
attention to animals.
- But if he should seize the Ring...
- He will become master of all Middle-earth.
The War of the Ring has begun, Frodo.
You will hear the rest in Council when you are well enough. Rest now.
"The leaves were long, the grass was green
"But the hemlock-umbels tall and fair
"And in the glade a light was seen
"Of stars in shadow, shimmering
"Tinúviel was dancing there"
Bilbo!
Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Where have you been?
Why haven't I seen you before?
I've seen a good deal of you, sitting by your side with Sam each day.
Bilbo, have you been here all the time?
All these years?
There didn't seem much reason to be anywhere else, after all.
The food's very good, and I listen, and I think.
A remarkable place altogether.
Yes.
And now, of course, there's all this bustle about that ring of mine.
Fancy the little thing causing such a disturbance. Have you got it here?
Yes, I have.
I'd very much like just to peep at it again, just for a moment.
Put it away.
I understand now.
I'm sorry.
Sorry about everything.
Don't adventures...
...ever have an end?
The Council of Elrond is beginning.
Come with me.
Both of you.
All that morning, the Council of Elrond
debated the history of the One Ring...
... and its master, Sauron.
Gandalf also told all present of Saruman...
... the traitor, and his desire
for the power of the Ring.
Elves and Dwarves, in their turn,
told what they knew of Sauron's...
... preparations for conquest,
and so did Boromir of Gondor.
In Gondor, we are already under attack by the forces of Mordor.
I am Boromir. In a dream...
...I heard a voice crying to me, saying:
"Seek for the sword that was broken."
Here is the sword of Elendil of Gondor...
...who fought the Dark Lord long ago and was slain.
So, Frodo learned at last...
... the true heritage of Aragorn,
the son of Arathorn...
... descendent of Isildur,
who cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.
Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all?
Bring out the Ring, Frodo.
The time has come.
Isildur's Bane.
The Halfling.
What shall we do with it then, this mightiest of all weapons?
We cannot keep it, we cannot destroy it.
Sauron, who forged it looks for his Ring...
...and Saruman who envies it, searches for its power, too.
I see no other road for us but the most fearful:
The road into Mordor.
We must send the Ring to the fire where it was made:
To Mount Doom.
What foolishness is this?
Why do you speak of hiding and destroying?
The Ring could save all Middle-earth.
Have you heard nothing?
It is Sauron's Ring. To wield it...
...you would have to become Sauron.
I will not touch it!
Nor I.
Our one hope lies in foolishness, Boromir.
The Dark Lord cannot conceive of anyone wishing to destroy his Ring.
He will wait until one of us tries to use it...
...follow every move we make.
And it is just possible that he may not notice...
...the small, quiet feet, walking into peril...
...into Mordor.
Very well. It's plain enough what you're pointing at.
Bilbo, the silly Hobbit, started this affair, and had better finish it, or himself.
When ought I to start?
It has passed beyond you, Bilbo.
This last journey must be for others to make.
Who are they to be?
That is what they're trying to decide here.
I will take the Ring...
...though I do not know the way.
I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo.
This is the hour of the Shire-folk, at last.
But you won't send him off alone, surely?
You, at least, shall go with him,
Master Samwise.
It is impossible to separate you, even when he is summoned to a Council...
...and you are not.
A nice pickle we've landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo.
I thought perhaps you might care to have these.
Bilbo, I don't think I should look right.
You can wear the shirt under your clothes.
It's as light as anything.
But I fancy it might turn...
...even the knives of the Black Riders.
I named the sword Sting, long ago.
It's silly, but there you are.
It shines when there are enemies about.
Orcs and things.
There. Now you look just a plain Hobbit on the surface...
Well, take care.
Bring back any old songs and tales you hear.
"I sit beside the fire
"And think of all that I have seen"
Our only hope is in speed and secrecy.
The Company of the Ring shall be nine.
Nine walkers against
the nine Riders of Mordor.
With Sam and Frodo, Gandalf will go.
For the other Free Peoples...
... Legolas shall be for the Elves,
and Gimli, son of Glóin, for the Dwarves.
For Men shall go the valiant...
... Boromir of Gondor,
and Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
And for the last two places,
we will trust to friendship...
... rather than to great wisdom,
Peregrin Took...
... and Meriadoc Brandybuck may also go.
When did you ever know such a storm, so far south?
The Dark Lord's arm has grown long if he can hurl snow at us...
...all the way from Mordor.
His arm has grown long.
No, Gandalf, not that dark way, I beg you!
And what would you suggest?
Returning to Rivendell to wait there for the end? We have no choice, Aragorn!
We might go by way of the Gap of Rohan.
That'd take the Ring too close to Isengard and Saruman. We dare not risk it.
Yet you would risk the mines of Moria.
Where both you and I have walked before and come out again alive.
The memory is very evil.
I do not wish to enter Moria a second time.
And I don't wish to enter it even once.
Nor me.
The question is not who wishes to go, but who will?
There is no other way to pass the mountains.
I will go with you.
My cousin Balin led a company of Dwarves there, many years ago.
There has been no word of them in all that time.
Elves do not walk in the dark earth.
I will go, but I fear for you, Gandalf.
I will not go, not unless the vote of the whole company is against me.
What does the Ring-bearer say?
I do not wish to go.
But I will go, if Gandalf advises it.
Steady, easy, Bill. Old Gandalf will have that gate open in a minute.
- What if he can't?
- I've never seen anything he couldn't do.
Sam!
Fireworks are all very nice, but this is elf magic.
What a people you Dwarves are for hiding things.
On the gates of your most wondrous, ancient kingdom you write:
"Speak, friend, and enter," and no spell in any language can open the door.
Why do you keep looking at the lake, Frodo?
I'm afraid of it.
And there sits our quest.
If we had to bring a wizard at all...
...it should have been Saruman.
Be still, Boromir.
Why? There are other ways to turn, if our Wizard's balked.
I said, from the beginning...
Gandalf, you old fool!
So, all you had to do was say, "friend," and enter.
Those were happier times.
Let us go.
I'm coming, Mr. Frodo! I'm coming!
Into the gateway! All of you!
Poor old Bill!
Gandalf, what was the thing in the water?
I do not know.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.
Whatever it was, it grabbed Frodo first, out of all of us.
Be quiet, Pippin!
We have gone far enough for today.
Let us stop here for the night.
Seems to have been a guardroom.
Yes, there's even a well.
We had better rest here.
It's hard to believe that even Dwarves...
...could have lived in this half-drowned dungeon!
It was a great realm once.
Be still! Both of you!
Which way do we take tomorrow, Gandalf?
I have not decided.
The path to the left smells foul, and I am too weary to choose.
The way ahead feels wrong, somehow.
At least the middle way goes up.
It's time we began to climb again.
Perhaps. I cannot remember.
What's that?
- Pippin!
- Just a stone.
I dropped a stone.
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time! Be quiet!
Fool of a Pippin!
Yes, this way.
We should find our way down to the Great Gates by tonight.
I shall be glad.
I doubt now that Dwarves ever came back here.
Why should they have come back?
What was left for them to mine?
Mithril silver!
The most precious metal in the world.
"Balin, son of Fundin...
"...Lord of Moria."
They did come back.
It seems to be a record of the colony.
Orc swords. There was a great battle here.
Yes.
"Balin is now Lord of Moria."
Here it says, "We found Mithril."
Now it says:
"Yesterday, Balin, Lord of Moria, fell.
"An Orc shot him from behind a stone.
"We slew the Orc, but many more..."
Then it says, "We have barred the gates."
And something about,
"The Watcher in the Water."
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.
But I feel.
It is grim reading.
"They have taken the bridge.
They are coming!
"We cannot get out!
Drums, drums in the deep!"
There is nothing more.
Gandalf? I don't want to stay here.
We are going now, Pippin.
There is nothing more.
They are coming.
Slam the doors and wedge them.
Keep the east door ajar.
We must not get shut in.
Orcs and something else.
A great Cave-troll, I think.
Out this way!
The Shire!
For the Shire!
Now is the last chance! Run for it!
I'm all right. I can walk.
I thought you were dead.
All of you, down the stairs!
Lead the way, Gimli!
Pippin and Merry next.
Come no closer! I warn you!
Balrog!
Fly, all of you!
Fly, up the stairs and straight on.
Fly! You cannot help me.
You cannot pass.
I am a servant of the Secret Fire.
You cannot pass.
Go back to the shadow.
You cannot pass.
Fly, you fools!
Come. Follow me.
Obey him!
- There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.
- I don't care.
Now it is your turn, Frodo.
I'm all right. What does it matter now?
It matters. We still have a long road, and much to do.
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.
Mithril shirt!
That's what saved you.
I have never seen one so beautiful.
- There!
- What is it?
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.
The Orcs will not come after us until dark.
It never sounds like an orc.
They're bare feet and they flap.
Whatever creature it is, it won't follow us where we're going.
Nothing evil passes through Lothlorien.
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?
I would almost rather face the Balrog again, than the Lady.
Lothlorien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it, unless a man...
...brings evil there with him.
- Welcome to Lothlorien.
I am Galadriel and this is my lord, Celeborn.
The forests have told us of your loss.
We sorrow for you, and for all of Middle-earth.
Rest here now for a little, until you are healed.
Your quest is known to us.
We will do what we can to aid you.
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?
"Let the night never cease to call you
"Let the day never more be the same"
It is a song about Gandalf, isn't it?
Yes, Mithrandir was the Elves' name for him.
It means, Grey Pilgrim.
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.
We never knew he had so many names.
I think he was fondest of Gandalf.
"We're still guided by your light
"You're walking beside us
"A prayer in the night
"With the fear rushing through the shadows
"Like a star shining deep in his heart
"You will know in your hearts forever
"Never more
"Will we stand
"Alone"
This is the mirror of Galadriel.
It shows things that were, and things that are...
...and things that yet may be.
Do you wish to look?
I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home.
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.
Come then, you shall look...
...and see what you may.
I got to go home!
They've dug up Bagshot Row...
...and thrown my poor old Gaffer out in the street.
I've got to go home.
The mirror shows many things, Sam, and not all have yet come to pass.
Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions...
...turn aside from their path to prevent them.
Do you wish to leave Frodo now, and go home?
No.
Gandalf?
No, it must be Saruman.
Do not touch the water.
He is looking for you.
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.
The door is closed.
"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky."
Yes.
We hid those three from him, and he has never touched them.
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand...
...against him and we are defenseless.
Yet, if you succeed, if the One Ring is destroyed...
...all we built with the three will fade.
Time will come here, and Lothlorien will fade.
You are the footstep of doom to us, Frodo.
Lady Galadriel, I will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it.
It's too great a matter for me.
And I came to test your heart.
You will give me the Great Ring freely...
...and in place of the Dark Lord you will set up a queen.
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...
...and terrible as the morning and the night.
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.
All shall love me and despair!
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west...
...and remain Galadriel.
And you must depart in the morning.
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.
In a few days, we will have to choose:
Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor...
...or turn east to Mordor and its Dark Lord?
Or shall we break our fellowship?
I'm going with Mr. Frodo.
I know that, Sam.
What a place. What a horrible place!
Behold the Argonath, the pillars of the kings.
They are Isildur and Anarion, my fathers of old.
If Gandalf were here...
The day has come at last, the day of choice, which we have long delayed.
What shall now become of our company?
I am not Gandalf.
I have tried to guide you as he would've done, but...
...if he had any plan for this moment, he never told me.
Even if he had, if he had lived...
...I think the burden would still have fallen on you, Frodo.
You alone can choose your way now.
The burden is heavy.
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.
Let me be alone!
You shall have your hour.
And you shall be alone.
Who's there?
Boromir.
I was afraid for you, Frodo.
The Orcs may be on this side of the river by now.
May I stay and talk to you, just for a while?
You're kind, but there's nothing to be said.
I know what I should do, but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?
I know what your advice would be:
To go with you to Gondor and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.
And is that such ill counsel?
Why should we fear to use the Ring in a just cause?
Whatever is done with the Ring turns to evil.
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it, and Galadriel herself...
Yes, I know all that.
And for themselves, they may be right, these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!
But truehearted Men will not be corrupted.
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.
Only the strength to defend ourselves.
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?
You cannot answer me, none of them can.
It's folly not using the Enemy's power against him.
Think what Aragorn could do with the Ring in this hour.
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, until I stood face to face with Sauron.
And they tell us to throw it away!
Come with me, Frodo.
My city is not far.
You can go to Mordor from there, if you must.
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.
Lend me the Ring.
No, Boromir. No!
Fool, obstinate fool!
It is only yours by chance.
It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me!
Miserable trickster!
You'll sell us all to Sauron.
Traitor!
Curse you to death and darkness, all you Halflings!
What have I done?
Frodo, come back!
A madness took me, but it has passed.
Come back!
This waiting's horrible.
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?
I tried to convince him to come to Minas Tirith.
I grew angry and he vanished.
Is that all you have to say?
He put the Ring on.
But where did he go? Where is he?
Mr. Frodo!
Gimli, Legolas, stop them!
I don't know what part you've played in this mischief, but help now!
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them, even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.
Sam Gamgee, your legs are too short, so use your head.
The boats.
Coming, Mr. Frodo.
Coming!
It's only water, now.
I'm here, Sam.
Save me, Mr. Frodo.
Help, I'm drowning!
- Take my hand.
- Where's your hand?
Here. Here it is.
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.
Mr. Frodo, that's hard.
If I hadn't guessed right, where would you be now?
Safely on my way.
"Safely"?
All alone and without me to help you?
But I am going to Mordor.
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.
It's no good trying to escape you.
I'm glad, Sam.
May the others find a safe road.
Aragorn will look after them.
I don't suppose we shall see them again.
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.
- This way!
- Frodo!
Halfling.
Boromir.
Boromir.
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.
I'm sorry. I have paid.
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.
Save my people.
Aragorn...
I will go...
...I promise you.
The Halflings, Orcs took them.
I think they are not dead.
Either we take the last boat and follow
Frodo, or we follow the Orcs on foot.
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.
We cannot forsake them.
The fate of the Ring-bearer is in my hands no longer.
The Company of the Ring has played its part. We follow the Orcs.
Filth!
Maggots!
Can't run.
Hello, Pippin.
So you've come on this expedition, too?
When do we get bed and breakfast?
Bed and breakfast in Isengard, understand?
They are alive.
One of them, anyway.
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.
How far ahead of us are they, Aragorn?
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night, or go on while our strength holds?
Do you think the Orcs will rest?
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail, or miss a sign, like that brooch.
There will be no more signs.
I cannot run all the way to Isengard.
Thank goodness for that rope the Elves gave you.
We'd never have gotten down that last cliff without it.
There's Mount Doom again, Mr. Frodo.
See it?
What a fix!
The one place that we don't want to see any closer...
...and that's the one place we're trying to get to.
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.
Cautious, my precious.
Don't turn!
It's him.
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?
He's been following us since Moria.
My precious! More haste, less speed.
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.
Be careful!
He's much more dangerous than he looks.
Where is it, my precious?
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.
Got you, you spying...
Let go, Gollum!
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!
Don't hurt us!
Don't let them hurt us, precious.
Cruel little Hobbitses.
Jumps on us like cats on poor mices, Gollum.
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice to us, won't we, precious?
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature when he had the chance.
I will not touch him.
Now that I see him, I do pity him.
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us, not Hobbits, huh?
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.
You will have to come with us and help us, if you can.
Yes, indeed!
Nice Hobbits!
And where are they going in these cold, hard lands, we wonder?
We are going to Mordor. You know that.
Lead us to the gates of his land.
No, precious.
Hobbits mustn't go there.
Gollum! Leave us alone!
Gotcha!
I think your rope might prove useful again.
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.
Don't hurt us! No!
It burns! It bites!
It freezes!
Take it off us. It hurts us.
Don't you do it!
It hurts us.
What promise can you give me that I can trust?
Sméagol will be very good.
Sméagol will swear never to let him have it.
Sméagol will save it.
The precious is before you, Sméagol.
Speak your promise!
We promises, yes, I promise...
...I will serve the master of the precious.
- Good master.
- Good Sméagol.
Take the rope off, Sam.
Off we go. Follow Sméagol.
Sméagol knows a secret way, he does, across the marshes.
Follow Sméagol.
I said, "No shooting."
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine!
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.
Bind their legs.
White-skins break through. Understand?
You and your stinking Wizard.
You got us into this.
When I tell them in Mordor...
They are far, far away.
If stinking Wizard doesn't get you, the white-skins will.
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.
Get it? Get what?
Nothing, my precious.
It's no good groping in the dark.
Ugluk will be back any minute.
Nothing for Mordor.
Nothing for poor Grishnakh and Gollum.
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet!
Wait. You can't find it without our help.
You help me.
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.
You should have studied maps more and played less in Rivendell.
This is Fangorn Forest.
Then we're no safer than we were with the Orcs.
We've no blankets and almost no food.
It looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.
We don't even know where we're trying to go.
Let's climb up there.
Maybe we can find out where we are, at least.
It's nice here.
The forest looks so different in the sunlight.
I know.
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.
Almost felt you liked the forest?
That's uncommonly kind of you.
The Orcs made us run here, and when we tired...
...they carried us, cut our ropes and ran into the forest and we came to your hill...
"Hill?"
A hasty word...
...for something that has stood here since the world was shaped.
You may call me Treebeard.
We thought you were a tree, standing there.
Not a tree, a tree herder.
Please, Treebeard...
...now that you know our story...
...whose side are you on?
I am not altogether on anybody's side...
...because nobody is altogether on my side.
But I am no friend of these...
...tree-killing Orcs and their masters.
They were here, no doubt of it.
- But where they went...
- I don't understand these other marks.
Look!
Your bow, Legolas! It's Saruman.
- Shoot before he puts a spell on us, fast!
- Elf...
...Man and Dwarf together?
A rare sight in these times.
Stop him, Legolas!
Gandalf?
Beyond all hope.
Gandalf!
Yes.
That was my name.
But where have you... Gandalf!
What happened?
A long time I fell.
Long I fell and he fell with me.
His fire was about me.
I was burned.
Ever he clutched me, and ever
I hewed him, far under the living earth...
... until at last, he fled back up
the secret ways of Moria.
There we fought,
above the mists of the world...
... and the mountain was wreathed
with lightning.
I threw down my enemy
and his fall broke the mountainside.
Then darkness took me...
... and I wandered far,
on roads that I will not tell.
Naked, I was sent back for a brief time...
...until my task was done.
And it is time I was about it.
You come with me to Edoras, my friends, to the city of the Riders?
To Edoras, now?
But to leave Merry and Pippin?
They are in no danger, believe me.
The great danger is to Edoras.
Saruman's Orcs will attack there within
two days, and Theoden has need of us.
Theoden has grown old.
He shivers by his fire now...
... and leaves everything in the hands
of his new minister:
Grima Wormtongue.
Those Riders you followed,
who rescued Merry and Pippin...
... they were led by Theoden's nephew,
Eomer.
He is all but an outlaw
in Rohan these days.
He hunts the Orcs
wherever he finds them...
... defying Wormtongue's orders
to let them pass.
So Wormtongue calls him traitor
and renegade...
... and Theoden believes...
Gandalf, the Riders of Rohan
are the bravest fighters...
... but they were never many.
If Saruman strikes now,
he'll overrun Edoras in a single night.
Our time is at hand.
Theoden's hundreds will face your tens of thousands.
When all of Rohan, your ancient oppressor, lies vanquished...
...then shall we fly eastward...
...and sweep all of Middle-earth beneath our feet.
We cannot be defeated!
Halfway between Edoras and Isengard,
there lies a fortress called Helm's Deep.
If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...
... the fortress will stop them longer
than the wooden halls of Edoras.
We are buying time, Aragorn.
Time? Time for what?
Perhaps for a miracle.
Perhaps only for Frodo to get a little further on his way...
...while the armies that should be hunting for the Ring...
...waste their own time destroying us.
I have returned.
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time for all friends to gather together.
And...
...do you...
...expect me...
...to welcome you here...
...Master Gandalf?
Troubles follow you like crows.
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?
Justly spoken, Lord.
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring...
...in Lorien, the Sorceress of the Golden Wood weaves deceit.
And such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return.
It is I...
...who counsel the King now.
He hears you no longer.
No, Grima Wormtongue.
He hears nothing but your voice telling him that he rules here...
...only because Saruman is kind to old men...
...and that the best thing for a sickly, feeble king...
...is to let Wizards and Orcs do as they will in Rohan.
I am my own man, Gandalf...
...as I was.
It is true that...
...Grima advises me often to leave
Saruman in peace...
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.
You are still unwell.
And he does remind me that it would be safest for Rohan...
...to seek their friendship...
...no matter how I may feel!
Dear Lord, let me deal with these troublesome guests.
How long has it been, Grima Wormtongue?
How long since Saruman bought you?
For I saw you at Isengard.
Did I not counsel your doorkeeper to forbid his staff?
Down, snake.
Down on your belly.
Grima is often...
...at Isengard.
I sent him there with messages.
And he returns with poison...
...Saruman's poison in your ears, Theoden.
Chilling your heart, making you old.
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!
Grima...
...is this so?
I will not harm you, Grima.
Is it so?
Let him go!
My sister-daughter, Eowyn.
My only loyal kin...
...since her brother has disobeyed my commands.
Wormtongue's command, Theoden.
If Eomer had not defied him...
...their cause might be already lost.
- Tell me, Gandalf...
...what I must do now.
We cannot wait here for Saruman's attack.
Every man that can ride must be sent immediately...
...to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.
When Saruman learns that we have gone there, and he will...
...we will have the Riders of Rohan.
I will find Eomer and his Riders.
My armor!
Look for me at Helm's Deep.
That's all, Theoden.
And he's gone again...
...like a wind in the grass.
Stormcrow.
- Aragorn?
- My Lord?
Is there any hope for us?
Sam, you simpleminded...
You fell asleep.
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.
- Sméagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.
He won't leave his precious, anyway.
Are we rested?
Ready to go on?
Nice Hobbitses.
Trust Sméagol now?
Stop!
Shivery light.
Nasty.
Look!
Wraiths.
Wraiths on wings!
The precious is calling them!
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up!
Slow down, I tell you.
No time, no time.
The precious is heavy, yes.
Very heavy, Sméagol knows.
If it's too heavy for nice Master...
...little Sméagol will carry it.
Sméagol doesn't mind.
Give it to Sméagol.
Do not say that again.
Do not think it.
Before you touched the precious again,
Sméagol...
...I would put it on and have you leap off a cliff, or into a fire...
...and you would do it, Sméagol.
Nice, Master.
Nice, Master.
Gollum!
Sméagol promised.
Yes, we promised to save our precious...
...never to let him have it, but it's...
...going to him, my precious is nearer every step.
I can't help it.
Sméagol promised to help nice Hobbit.
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.
We hates Bagginses.
Must have the precious. Must have it.
We wants it.
But there's two of them.
Yes.
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.
She might help us...
...but Sméagol promised nice Hobbit.
Nice Hobbit.
Hey, you...
...what are you pawing at him for?
Where've you been anyway, sneaking off and sneaking back?
"Sneaking"?
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.
Tired, thirsty Sméagol, he finds a secret way through the mountain...
...a tunnel with no Orcses anywhere, and they say "sneak."
"Sneak"?
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.
Hello, Sméagol.
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking!
I like this place.
There is good rock here.
This country has tough bones.
Up on the ridge! They're coming!
There they are!
Fire of Isengard!
We're breached. Retreat to the caves.
The caves!
Theoden King.
I will not end here...
...taken like an old badger in a trap.
When dawn comes...
...I will bid men sound Helm's horn...
...and I will ride forth.
Will you ride with me then, son of Arathorn?
At least, we may make such an end...
...as will be worth a song.
I will ride with you.
We're there, Sam.
Another day, maybe two.
When light comes tomorrow, the mountains will be near.
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo, because we're running awful low on food.
I reckon we've got enough left to see us to this Mount Doom.
After that...
...I don't know.
Samwise Gamgee.
My dearest Hobbit, friend of friends...
..."after that," if the Ring goes into the fire, and we are at hand?
"After that," dear Sam.
I wouldn't worry.
Just to get there.
Just to get there.
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.
We must go.
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.
Orcs find us. Ringwraiths find us.
Must go on to safe, secret place.
Sméagol's secret way!
The straight stair...
...and the winding stair. Up, up...
...through black, sharp mountains.
Follow good Sméagol.
Straight stair, winding stair...
...what comes after that?
We shall see, yes...
...we shall see.
Gandalf!
The forces of darkness were driven
forever from the face of Middle-earth...
... by the valiant friends of Frodo.
As their gallant battle ended...
... so too ends the first great tale of...
...The Lord of the Rings.
Guards
Yes
I want to see chen Lie and Yan Lebu
Yes, I'll call them
An order from the emperor... asking for chen Lie and Yan Lebu to see him, chen Li and Yan Lebu are here,
Your Majesty
Long live, Your Majesty chen Lie
I'm here
Yan Lebu
I'm here
I've already read about your letters
You two are still pleading
... for the poorly educated Han people
I just don't understand
... why you're doing this!
Your Majesty
About the case of Jiang Nan Words,
... too many people were involved
The scholar, Lui Liuliang, chief Secretary, cha Zhiting and
Wang Jingqi, the staff of General Liang;
They were punished because of the words they used
That was in accordance with my decree
They were trying to oppose the government
They deserved to die
However, the people in southern china
... are very angry
If we don't tackle the situation in time,
... the consequences could be drastic!
What a great Government Officer!
Yan Lebu
Yes, your Majesty
You're a Manchu
How can you plead for them?
Don't you still want your head?
I'll take the risk to tell you the truth
It's for the sake of ching Dynasty's welfare
I hope that you'll consider our suggestion
I don't care if I lose my life
The Emperor's order is the law
It cannot be changed all the time
How dare you disrespect the emperor!
Don't think that you're from the White Flags
... and I cannot kill you
We're really loyal to your Majesty
Please reconsider our suggestions
Get out!
Please excuse us
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
Pass on my word
Have those two traitors executed
Yes, your Majesty
Your Majesty
I have something to inform you, but I'm not sure if I should
Stop mumbling. Tell me now
Yes, your Majesty. There's a saying... that an Emperor doesn't kill the consultants
If you have them eliminated...
I'm afraid it could arouse trouble!
From what I see...
What is your good opinion?
For the sake of your Majesty's reputation,
I think... we should do it secretly
Yes
Xin Kang
Yes, your majesty
I'll leave it to you
Do a clean job. Got it?
Yes, your Majesty
If there're any mistakes,
... you'll lose your head
Yes, your Majesty
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
How goes the task I gave you?
Your Majesty, chen and Yan are important officers
We have to be very careful
I'm still waiting for the right chance
I wouldn't be kept waiting forever,
I hope?
Sorry, your Majesty
Your Majesty
I have one weapon that can... behead a man 1 00 paces away
The victim will never know what him
What is it called?
The Flying Guillotine
Your Majesty
This is the Flying Guillotine
How can this weapon... take a man's head 1 00 steps away?
This can kill the enemy at the speed of light
Just control this chain
If it catches the enemy's head, a hood will drop down. Pull the chain
... and 3 sharp blades will be triggered
Victims will be beheaded and killed instantly
The Flying Guillotine is really powerful!
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
I want to see how it really works
Yes, your Majesty
Your Majesty
For the Flying Guillotine,
I still can't control it well enough
So I can only shoot it within 4 steps
After I've mastered it,
I can do it beyond 1 00 steps
This weapon is powerful indeed
Once you've mastered it,
I'm afraid even I won't dare sleep at night
This slave wouldn't dare...
I doubt if you'll have the guts
Yes, your majesty
Xin Kang, listen...
At your service
Let Xin Kang be promoted to join the Yellow Flags
From the special agents, choose the 1 2 best imperial guards... and train them to use the Flying Guillotine
Those 1 2 agents have to be loyal to me or I'll kill everybody related to them
For just one traitor, many will be killed
Yes, your Majesty
The Emperor is leaving...
With the spirit of God, we promise to be loyal to your Majesty and be at your service forever;
Even if it means risking our lives
The mountain can be torn down, but our will won't change
If we have second thoughts, we shall kill ourselves
...with no regrets
This oath we take willingly
Xin Kang
Ma Teng
Xu Shuangkun
Xie Tianfu
Luo Peng cha Zhiliang chen Xinyi cheng Ziping
Wang Xiaoliang
Yu Weixiao
Zhao Xueli
Sun Jian
Zhou Zhizhong
Guys, consider yourselves lucky to be the chosen ones
From now on, we must practise the Flying Guillotine hard
With your levels of basic Kung Fu, you will master the weapon in 6 months
Let's start
Release
Practise again
Pull
You're good
That's great!
You have some good moves
You two seem to be the best
But the distance is still too short
Practise again
Yes
An imperial decree from the Emperor
Please listen
By the order of the emperor,
Ma and Xu are awarded with
1 00 taels of gold for doing well with the Flying Guillotine
It's an encouragement for them
Thank the Emperor for his kindness
Mr. Zhang
Mr. Zhang, we just started to practise today
How does the Emperor know about it?
Had he been some ordinary person... how could he be the Emperor?
Xin Kang, be very careful
Brother Xu,
The emperor knows everything
He's like God continue practicing
Hey, everybody!
I think you're all tired
Take a bath and rest for a while
We'll practise again at night
Okay
Let's go
Brother Ma, are you tired?
I'm okay.
Looks like I'm getting used to it
I don't understand why the emperor asks us to learn the Flying Guillotine
That's needless to say
Of course it's for killing the traitors
Who? Who'd dare to betray?
The emperor just needs to give the order
He can kill whomever he wants
Why waste all this effort... to kill people with the Flying Guillotine?
Well, I don't understand either
Reckon, the emperor must have his reasons
Ever since we started practicing,
... we haven't left the palace once
I can' stand it anymore
You little kid, already thinking about women?
What so funny about it?
Oh, come on! I'm not a eunuch
More than a month without ' it ' kills me!
Good...
Keep going...
Quickly...
Keep going...
Quickly...
Good...
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Oh, I understand
You're like me who can't stand the loneliness of the palace, right?
But I haven't met you before!
How can we...
Who are you?
My name is Wanzhu
The emperor sent me to you as a present
The emperor remarked... you're not a eunuch
So instead of sending you gold etc; K he just asked me to wait upon you well
Brother Ma,
... the emperor really knows everything
What did you say?
Tonight, I'll sleep here with you,
I want to talk to you till dawn
Ma Teng
Yes
You do it
Yes
Release
Good...
The Emperor is here...
Rise
Ma Teng
At your service
You're young and capable. Good!
You can aim perfectly in just 4 months
Keep it up. You'll have a bright future
Thank you, your Majesty
Xin Kang
Yes, your Majesty
There's still something
I don't understand
The Flying Guillotine spins in the air
Say if someone gets defensive in advance... the Flying Guillotine won't work, right?
Your Majesty, the Flying Guillotine spins at a very high speed
Anything that hits it... will be driven away by the spinning force
Show me again
Yes, your Majesty
Ma Teng
Yes
Your Majesty,
Even if the enemies use weapons for defence, their Kung Fu can't save them from death
Even if the enemies lie on the floor, the Flying Guillotine can still take their lives
Very good
This thing really seems invincible
You all just keep up the good work & practice
I will give everybody rewards
Thank you, your majesty
Xie Tianfu
Yes, your majesty
So, how was the gift
I sent you last night?
It's my fault. Sorry
How can you be that useless?
Are you really a eunuch, or what?
When I gave you such a good reward, you should enjoy it to its fullest
Don't worry. It's not your fault
Thank you, your Majesty
The Emperor is leaving...
Brother, what happened?
Nothing much
Brother Xu, sorry
Are you blind?
Shit! You wanted to kill me?
No... I didn't do it on purpose
Stop it
Stop fighting... Stop!
Ma Teng, why are you fighting?
My mother gave me this Jade Buddha
He stepped on it;
... which means he disrespects my mom
That's why I have to beat him up
Ah Kun, go back
Who? Who?
Mr. Xin. It's me
Ah Kun, it's you?
I thought it's someone else
What are you doing here at midnight?
My... my purse has gone missing
Maybe you dropped it in the training hall
I'll have a look there come back quickly
Yes, Mr. Xin
You should rest earlier
What are you doing?
I want to meet His Majesty
Search him
Yes
Go in
Your Majesty
Xu Shuangkun is here to see your Majesty
Xu Shuangkun
Why are you here this late?
It's my fault
I met Mr. Xin when I got out
He almost knew the secret
I got myself out with a little trick
What do you have to report to me?
Your Majesty,
I've found Ma Teng having second thoughts
He is planning a rebellion
Ma Teng?
He practiced a lot and improved quickly
How can you tell he's having a second thought?
Well, I've been observing him
He's been acting mysteriously
So I think he must have something in mind
Today, why were you fighting with him?
He almost killed me with the Guillotine
Therefore... you want to take revenge here, right?
This slave wouldn't dare...
I really appreciate Ma Teng's Kung Fu
He will become somebody great later
I'm planning to make good use of him, unless you can prove what you've said
Yes, your Majesty
Go away
Yes
Success!
They've succeeded
A secret decree from the Emperor
Xin Kang shall receive it
Yes.
-Ma Teng
-Yes
-Xie Tianfu
-Yes
-Luo Bong
-Yes
-Xu Tianfu
-Yes
The Emperor ordered... that you commence your mission at once
Yes
Master, please have some Ginseng tea
Put it on the table
That is Officer chen
Are you sure, Mr. Xin?
I'm sure. Do it
Do it, quickly
Master...
Oh no...somebody is coming!
The lord's head is gone!
Lord Yen, please don't bother
I'll walk you till here
Master...
Somebody come quickly...
Master...
We've killed two government officers chen Lie and Yan Lebu
Those two officials were loyal and honest
Of course
The whole world knows about it
These two people are brave enough to tell emperor the truth
They saved a lot of scholars
I don't understand... why would the emperor have them killed
I heard that at Mr. Yan's funeral... weeping people lined the streets
They all think these mysterious beheadings... are something unbelievable
Okay. Let's do it like this
You take us as your godsons
We'll be at your service from now on
No. How can l?
Please sit down
We must pay our respects
Kowtow to our godfather
Alright...
Everyone, rise
It's Officer Shi's house
Yes. He's also a good government officer
Why the emperor wants him dead?
Brother Ma, what happened to me?
My hands can't stop shaking
I can't do this
We'll climb up to the top of the wall there
We'll get for sure from the top, let's go
Where's Tianfu?
Xie Tianfu, are you ok? come here come here quickly
Mr. Xin
Tianfu. You do it
I...
Do it...
I can't...I can't do it
I can't kill anymore
I can't be the killer for the emperor
I can't kill anymore
I can't be the killer for the emperor
I can't...
Tianfu, calm down
It's okay. Let's go
I can't kill anymore. I...
Master...
Somebody come quickly
Master was assassinated
Xie was scolding over there
... and insulting the emperor
Godfather
Ah Kun. come over here
Godfather, you look worried
I just got a secret decree from the Emperor
Who is it today?
You read it yourself
Xie Tianfu
I'm afraid...
What's the matter with you?
I had a nightmare
You're just too tired.
I'll get you some tea
Tianfu
Who did it?
Who killed Xie Tianfu and Wanzhu?
Who? Who...
I did
It's you?
You killed Xie Tianfu and Wanzhu
I did
I killed Wanzhu
You're all crazy. All of you
You've lost your mind and soul
Xie Tianfu has been through a lot with us
He's our brother
What actually did he do?
How can you do this to him?
It's the emperor's order. We can't refuse
He asked us to learn the Flying Guillotine
... in order to eliminate betraying officers
I can't believe, our brother
... was killed by the Flying Guillotine
Maybe someday it'll be my turn
... or your turn!
We have taken an oath on our lives
We'll forever be loyal to the emperor
Our heads don't belong to us anymore
So it doesn't matter about our family
Yes, we've lost our mind and family
We're not human
We're just killing tools for the emperor
Killers for the emperor

Everybody talks about Feng Yang
Feng Yang used to be a great place
But since we had a emperor from this place
We had 9 bad years out of 1 0
The rich ones sold their land
Master, you're here. This way, please...
What do you want to eat?
A bottle of wine and a big bowl of noodle
Yes
Everybody talks about Feng Yang
There're disasters every year
The dam was broken and this resulted in floods
Acres of fields have gone under water
Welcome
Please go in, there're seats
Master, here's your noodle
Good...
Master, please spare me a few coins
Master, be kind, spare me a few coins
Thank you
Mister...here is your food and wine
Get out...
Go away chase
Have you seen anyone suspicious?
No
Ma Teng. Follow us back
You can't escape come down
Take him away
Left hand with a gong and right with a drum,
We carry the gong and drum and sing a song
I don't think I can sing other songs,
I just know the tune of Feng Yang Song
Feng Yang Song
Our life is tough. It's really tough
I can't get a good husband in my life
Other's husbands all have a wonderful job
My wife at home has a pair of big feet
It's longer than a foot...
Good...
You're injured!
There's an old temple there.
Let's rest there
Miss, I'm cold. can you start a fire, please?
You lie down here. I'll get you a doctor
Miss
You can't get a doctor here, you can't
But look at you...
I'd rather die here than call a doctor
I understand
Miss, don't go
You've saved me, how can I pay you back?
I wanted to. You don't have repay me
Why were you caught?
Sorry, I can't tell you
See you
Miss
May I know your name?
Sorry, I can't tell you
My surname is Ma. Ma Teng
I know
You know?
Your pictures are everywhere in the city
Everybody knows you
But you're not scared of me...
I'm not. The Emperor nabs people everyday
He only killed the innocent and good folk
Let's go now
This is not a safe place
There're guards everywhere
I'm also injured
Where can I go?
Do you live around here?
I lost my family and I have no home
We can run together
We'll go through this together
I'm not worried about living, wait...
I have a lot of gold
It belongs to the emperor
This is useless
If you expose identity, you still have to die
Don't worry. I know farming
I know how to keep pigs
This gold is useless
- Ivy!
- Hi, Mom.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, Mom, two tests again, both in math.
They popped one on us.
Can you believe it?
You're kidding? No warning at all?
No, they didn't.
Come on, sweetie.
Hello, George.
No, Paris. Well, at least that's what Jennifer told Peter.
By the way, dear Jill O'Connor says she's started to... you know what.
- No, what?
- Menstruate.
- She's only nine. Do you believe it?
- No, I think she's a fibber.
- She's a liar.
- I didn't say that.
Girls like Jill just like to fantasise.
Hey.
- How about a Coke?
- I'll have it later.
OK.
Oh, Ivy, don't forget to hang your coat on a chair.
Oh, all right.
- Open up.
- Bill...
Oh!
- Hey, what is it? You're shaking.
- It's just the weather.
You're home early. Well,
I'll get a glass chilling for your martini.
- Oh, don't mention that word, please.
- Another one of those days?
- Yeah, another one of those lunches.
- Oh...
- I gotta lie down, Janice.
- You've got an hour.
Carole and Russ are coming for dinner.
With their aunt.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry.
No, no.
- Hiya, princess.
- Hi, Daddy.
- I found out.
- What?
Mom...
- Mom likes cameras, right?
- Right.
I was walking with her past a camera store and I saw her looking at this real long lens.
It's so neat.
It's got all these little dinkies on it.
- Little dinkies like that.
- Yeah?
When can we buy it?
- Well, it's an awful long way to Christmas.
- Yeah.
But your birthday's next week.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Yeah, but I'm not gonna tell you.
- All right...
- Surprise me.
The Hotel des Artistes, built by artistes for artistes.
What the hell are we doing here?
I don't know about you, but I have hidden depths.
Mezzo, mezzo.
Excuse me.
We've got to go, Bill. Come along, Aunt.
Ivy. Ivy.
Ivy. Sweetie.
It's Mommy.
- Oh, Mom, it was awful.
- What was awful?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Well, it was just a dream.
- Yeah, a dream.
- Mm-hm.
Mom, I don't feel well.
- You don't seem to have a fever.
- Darn.
But I think we'll keep you home from school tomorrow anyway.
I love you.
Oh, I love you too.
Bill...
Something strange happened today.
There was a man outside school.
Bill?
He has reddish-brown hair, pale blue eyes, he's about 5'8, 5'9.
A beard, rather a full beard. Kind of a weird, spaced-out look about him.
Well, when did you first notice him?
A couple of weeks ago. I spotted him on the bus. I was going home.
He looked rather familiar, like I'd seen him somewhere before.
The next day, he was in the elevator where I work.
Where's that?
386 Madison Avenue. I'm a partner in Simmons Templeton Advertising.
- Well, maybe he works there too.
- No.
Now I see him every morning when I take my daughter to school.
- Has this person ever battered you?
- Battered me?
Has he come into purposeful bodily contact with you?
Has he hit you? Has he pushed you?
No, nothing like that.
Unless there's evidence of assault and battery, there's very little we can do here.
What do I do? What? Do I shove him, push him, provoke him?
Get the son of a bitch to hit me? What does it take to get you to do something?
Look, Mr Templeton, I'm sorry, but there's no law that says that people can't be on the city streets wherever and whenever they'd like to be.
- I got one.
- OK.
Look, Mom, "slaughter".
- Oh! That's good.
Be right back. No peeking at my pieces.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Is she all right?
- Bill?
- I didn't see Ivy at school this morning.
Is she all right?
- 89, 90. Ten. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You've gotta give me another ten.
- What do you mean?
- You gave me a $10 bill.
- I gave you $20.
- You just gave me a ten. Look.
- Mister, I only had a $20 bill in my wallet.
You probably misread the bill.
Can you see the register?
Hey. What's the matter with you?
It's so beautiful.
It's fantastic. I love it.
- Thank you.
- Hey. What?
What's so fantastic? Well, now.
- Where did you find this?
- On top of the worktops, where you put it.
- What's going on?
- Daddy bought me a purse.
I found the package in the groceries with my name on it.
- Oh, it's gorgeous, Bill.
- Yeah.
It's the first grown-up present
I've ever gotten.
And the colours are just like the paintings in the ceiling. I love it.
- You didn't buy the purse.
- No.
He did. That man.
- How long have you known about him?
- Oh, my God, Bill. It's Ivy he's after.
- Why do you say that?
- Well, the way he looks at her.
And this morning he called just to see how she was. And now the purse.
Oh, Bill, please, let's call the police.
I went to them already.
Honey, there's nothing they can do unless he draws blood.
- Morning.
- Morning, Mrs Templeton.
It's a clipping from Who's Who.
Hoover, Elliot Suggens.
PhD. Metallurgist.
Born London, England. Educated
King's College, University of London,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Wife, Sylvia Flora.
Daughter, Audrey Rose.
Vice president, Unified Steel Corporation,
Pittsburgh. Writer. Lecturer.
- Published numerous articles.
- Take it to the police.
It's not enough.
All it is is a couple of facts about his life.
We can't even that prove he sent it.
- Then what are we going to do?
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Next time I see him, I'll grab him and find out what it's all about.
- Be very careful.
- Honey, you be careful.
If he bothers you at school today, just call a cop.
OK.
Right, take it easy or I'll run you both in.
The ambulance will be here soon, ma'am.
You'll be all right. I've got your bag.
Come on, keep moving.
Give her some air. Come on.
Oh, my God, Ivy! What time is it?
- I have to go.
- Take it easy.
- I have to go. I have to get my daughter.
Ivy!
Ivy!
Ivy!
Ivy!
Ivy!
Ivy is at home, Mrs Templeton.
I helped her across the street.
She's waiting in the lobby for you.
Here, you dropped your purse on the sidewalk.
We must talk. I'm certain now. Please.
Who are you? What do you want?
Tell your husband
I'll phone him this evening. Please.
You wait right there, young lady.
You are never, never, to leave school without me. Do you understand me?
Under no circumstances are you to go away with strangers.
You sit in that school office, and if you have to, you just wait and wait and wait.
- Do you understand me, Ivy?
- Mommy, you're hurting me.
I'm sorry.
- Mr Templeton?
- What is it you want?
- Why are you bothering us?
- My name is Elliot Hoover.
Now, look, I must see you and your wife.
It's very important.
Um... We could meet around the corner at Severino's Restaurant. It's quiet there.
That's impossible.
We can't leave our child alone.
Well, Carole Rothman might be willing to sit with Ivy for an hour or so, surely?
- Mr Templeton?
- I'll see.
Let's say 9.30.
If that's convenient, of course.
I'll see.
Call the police.
Not until I find out what the hell this is all about, babe.
Mr Templeton!
Mrs Templeton.
It's very quiet in here.
I... I've reserved a table.
Look, I want to thank you both very much for seeing me.
Good evening.
Would you like something, Mrs Templeton?
- Well, not for me, thank you.
- Scotch, Maria.
Ah, yes, I'll have tea.
Do you have any Chinese gunpowder?
I'll see if we have some.
For two weeks a man with a beard has been bugging my family. Is that man you?
Yes.
I apologise for that.
But all the subterfuge, the disguise, were absolutely necessary before this meeting could take place.
- I had to be sure.
- Of what?
Well, things had to be right before we met.
Let me explain.
It's taken me a very long time, seven years, in fact, seven years of travel, investigation and study, calling for a total reconditioning of all my spiritual...
What the hell are you talking about?
I'll try and make things as clear as I'm able to, Mr Templeton.
But first there are some things that you must know. Some very complex things.
So I'll begin at the beginning.
11 years ago, I was a very happy man.
I had a family.
A wonderful wife and a lovely daughter.
My daughter's name was Audrey Rose.
She was five when she died.
Everything that was good seemed to shine from her eyes, you know?
Anyway, there was an automobile accident and...
It happened just outside Pittsburgh.
There was a storm and their car just went off the road.
It was very quick, very sudden.
Thank you.
Naturally, the loss of my wife and my daughter was quite unbearable.
I don't know how I existed. One day I had a feeling that Audrey Rose was near me.
We didn't have any Chinese gunpowder, sir, so I brought you Formosa oolong.
Thank you, Maria.
I still don't understand what you're saying and why you're saying it to us.
All right.
About a year after the accident, a friend took me to a dinner party.
One of the guests was a psychic.
A clairvoyant.
She told me everything I had done since I was a boy, and then she began to talk about my daughter, Audrey Rose, describing her as if she were alive.
I asked her to stop, but she wouldn't.
I remember I began to cry, because I couldn't help it, and she leaned over and she asked me why I was crying.
So I told her that my wife and my daughter were dead.
But she said no.
No, my wife was at peace, but my daughter was alive.
I thought it was a poor joke. I couldn't believe that anybody could be that cruel.
Then a few months later I happened to be here in New York City on a business trip.
One night I was passing the Town Hall and I saw advertised on the marquee outside,
"Eric Lloyd, clairvoyant."
Anyway, after the lecture, or the demonstration, whatever,
I went back and saw Mr Lloyd in his dressing room and, like the woman at the party, he told me very accurate things.
Very accurate things indeed.
Things about my daughter, Audrey Rose.
Again, describing her as if she were alive, but this time giving me details of the home she lived in.
It was an apartment here in New York City that had a lovely ceiling with classic paintings set into it.
And even the room in which she slept, with the yellow and white curtains.
The matching canopy bed.
The...
The giant panda and the aquarium in the corner.
She had come back, he said.
Audrey Rose had come back...
I'm terribly sorry.
I'm sorry, Mrs Templeton, this must be a shock to you.
I can understand what a blow your daughter's death must've been, how hard it was for you to accept.
But what you're saying now...
Reincarnation, is that what you're saying?
There's no mistake, Mr Templeton.
The very moment I saw Ivy,
I could recognise all the subtle qualities that once belonged to Audrey Rose.
Mr Hoover, you can believe what you want, but please don't involve my family.
- You're wanted on the phone.
- Excuse me.
- Mrs Templeton, can we talk?
- No, excuse me. I have to go see...
All right, we'll be right up.
- What is it?
- Ivy.
- Ivy? What's the matter?
- I don't know.
- Mr Templeton, we haven't finished.
- Yes, Mr Hoover, we have finished.
We have listened to your story.
We're very sorry for you.
But leave us alone.
Don't follow us. Don't phone us.
Your problem is not our problem.
Sweetie. Ivy.
- Sweetie.
- Daddy... Daddy...
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...
Shh. Wake up, honey.
Shh. Hi.
Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi, Daddy. What are you doing here?
I just came to kiss my princess good night.
- I'm glad you're here.
- I'll always be here, darling.
It's all right. Do call.
I'll be home all morning.
OK. Good night.
Oh, Bill, those nightmares twice in one week.
Honey, come on. Don't panic, babe.
You know the pattern.
They come and they go.
Take her to see Dr Kaplan tomorrow, huh?
OK.
- What about Elliot Hoover?
- Oh, honey, he's a fanatic, a weirdo.
The city's full of 'em.
- What if he isn't?
- You believe his story?
Well, he believes it. He sincerely believes everything he's saying.
I know it's crazy, but there's something about the way he looked.
- Heavens.
- Don't worry.
- Hello?
- Mr Templeton? It's Elliot Hoover.
Hoover, I've had enough of you.
Leave us alone or I'll take steps to see that you do. Understand?
I don't know if he's an extortionist, or a nut, as you say, or a man who believes this to be so.
We're talking about an area that a lot of people don't know anything about.
When I was a boy, every Shabbos we used to sit around and listen to my grandfather tell stories about the dybbuk, an evil spirit who could come and invade bodies.
- What's that got to do with this?
- That every religion has its mysteries.
- Come on, Russ.
- OK, scoff.
But on Friday nights, when the candles were lit and he spoke of the dybbuk, he scared the hell out of us.
Question. Did this Hoover make any demands upon you?
No, but there's no saying he won't.
Russ, we are being primed for some kind of a shakedown.
- Is it possible to contact him?
- It's impossible to avoid him!
- He's been calling the office all morning.
- Good. Invite him to your home.
Are you crazy?
I won't let that lunatic into my house.
I'm your lawyer.
I need to know what he's after.
Extortion. Blackmail. Ivy.
You sit him down and drag this out very specifically from him.
I'll write out the questions, you memorise them and ask them.
Bill, I'll be there.
I'll be your witness.
It's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.
You know, it's exactly as Eric Lloyd described it.
Ceiling paintings.
Oh, my...
The huge windows.
And the carved fireplace.
It's unbelievable.
- Would you have a seat, Mr Hoover?
- Certainly.
A couple of psychics told you your daughter had come back to life.
- Is that right?
- Yes, that is correct.
Do you know the whereabouts of these psychics?
No. You see,
I never did know the woman's name, and Eric Lloyd died three years ago.
Too bad. So there's nobody around who could remember having said this to you?
No.
Well, why didn't you contact us back then?
Well, at the time, Mr Templeton, to be quite honest,
I was a scoffer and a disbeliever.
As you are now.
I must admit, it took me many years of seeking and searching in order to be convinced of the truth.
You see, Mrs Templeton, I went to India, where I learned of a way of life that was totally alien to mine.
But in time, with the help and the wisdom of simple people,
I came to know the reality of their religious convictions and to know the truth of reincarnation.
There are over 12 million people in this city.
How did we become the beneficiaries of your search?
Well, now, that was a process of elimination.
According to Eric Lloyd, she lived somewhere in New York City in a lovely apartment exactly like this one.
Her age would now be 11.
Let me put it this way,
Mr and Mrs Templeton.
Audrey Rose died October 3rd, 1965.
- That's Ivy's birthday.
- Yeah...
Audrey Rose died at approximately 8.20 in the morning.
Ivy was born at 8.22.
So... just like that, huh?
Dead one minute, back to life the next.
Don't you think that's a little unusual?
No, not really.
You see, there are many of schools of thought as to the precise moment that the soul unites with the body, Mr Templeton.
In Tibet, for example, it is generally believed that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated at the very instant of his death.
What is it you want?
Nothing more nor less than you and your good wife are prepared to give me.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Well, I'd just like the chance to see Ivy occasionally, to watch her grow, to be of help if needed.
She would never have to know about Audrey Rose.
Oh, my God.
Don't shock her.
Remember what the doctor said.
- Ivy!
- Oh, my God!
Bill, she can't seem to hear us.
Ivy, baby, it's Mommy and Daddy.
Honey, wake up.
Ivy... Sweetheart. Ivy! Ivy!
Ivy... Oh, Bill, be careful.
Ivy... Oh, my God.
Baby. Bill, be careful with her.
Oh, my God.
- Be careful, Bill.
- Ivy!
Ivy, it's Daddy. Wake up.
Audrey Rose!
Audrey... Audrey Rose...
Audrey...
Audrey... Audrey Rose...
Audrey! Audrey! Audrey Rose!
Audrey Rose...
Audrey, Audrey...
Audrey, it's me, it's Daddy.
Audrey... Audrey Rose... Audrey, it's me, it's Daddy. It's Daddy, it's me.
It's Daddy here. It's Daddy, Audrey.
Audrey, it's Daddy, it's me.
It's Dada. Dada. Come on, darling.
Come on, it's me.
- Daddy?
- It's Daddy.
It's Daddy. Yes, it's Daddy. Come on.
Yes, come on, come on, it's all right.
It's Dada. Daddy. Come on, it's Daddy.
It's all right. It's Daddy. Come on.
Come on, come on, it's Daddy, it's Dada.
- Yes, come on. Come on, darling.
- Daddy?
It's gonna be all right. Yeah, it's me.
It's Daddy. It's Dada. It's all right.
Audrey...
Audrey Rose...
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Templeton,
Mrs Templeton...
You see...
Sorry. You see, it was the accident.
There was a fire.
The car windows were closed.
The car windows were closed and she couldn't get out.
She couldn't get out of the car and I'm told it lasted for several minutes.
Forgive me.
The windows were closed. She couldn't...
Sorry.
My God.
I had no idea this was happening.
- I think she'll be all right now.
- You bastard!
- Bill, enough!
- Damn you, Hoover! Damn you!
You better get out of here.
Damn you, Hoover!
- Get going.
- I'm sorry. Please. I'll go.
I'll go. I'll go.
My God.
Bill.
- Bill.
- Honey.
Oh, honey.
It was the radiator. She burned them on the radiator, honey. Call Dr Kaplan.
Right.
- Dad... Daddy?
- Yes, princess, Daddy's here.
Daddy's here.
- Get some sleep.
- He's crazy. He's crazy, isn't he?
Just relax. I'll go to court tomorrow and get an injunction. We'll put a stop to this.
Russ, thanks.
What is going on?
What's happening to Ivy?
She had a nightmare, honey.
She's had them before.
Yes, and always around her birthday.
Two years ago they happened in October.
When she was six, they happened at exactly the same time.
Janice, please.
- How did she burn her hands?
- On the radiator.
The radiator was nowhere near the window.
What are you building? The room was dark. It was confusing and chaotic.
I saw her burn her hands on a cold window.
You think you saw that.
You only think you saw that.
Russ saw it too.
I could tell by the look on his face.
Honey, it didn't happen.
Bill, she burned her hands on a cold window.
Janice.
Honey, please listen to me.
What you're building here is not for me.
I can't accept it. I don't believe it.
When I die, it's gonna be the end of me.
- No.
- No wings, no harps, no pitchforks.
Nothing.
It's done, it's the end, it's finished.
No floating around some maternity ward waiting to sneak into the body of some unsuspecting infant.
He'd resent it and I'd feel very horrified.
Don't laugh, Janice. I'm not kidding.
- Janice?
- Oh, Bill.
Look, darling, I'm gonna be delayed here.
I'm locked up with a client.
Will you be home for dinner?
No, it's the full treatment.
It could be late.
- How's Ivy?
- OK.
Dr Kaplan just left.
He redressed her hands.
Did he say anything?
He thinks we should take her to a psychiatrist.
OK. Any calls?
No.
Good. Look, I'll be home as soon as I can break away from this thing, all right?
- OK.
- OK, bye.
Bye.
What's that for?
There's a draught coming through the panes. Ow! Damn screen.
Watch your language, Mother.
There are children present.
- That's the house phone.
- Thank you very much!
Hello?
There's a Mr Hoover on the line,
Mrs Templeton.
- Tell him I'm not at home.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr Kaplan's service.
- Yes, Dr Kaplan, please.
- Name?
- This is Mrs Templeton. Where is he?
Oh... Oh...
- Dr Kaplan?
- Mrs Templeton.
There's a Mr Hoover down here in the lobby.
- Send him up.
- Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
- Hurry, please.
- Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy... Daddy!
Audrey Rose. Audrey Rose.
Audrey Rose.
Audrey... Audrey... Audrey Rose.
- Daddy...
- Audrey... Audrey...
It's Daddy. It's Daddy.
It's Daddy.
Audrey, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.
It's Daddy. Come on, it's Daddy.
It's Daddy. Dada. Yeah.
It's Daddy. It's your daddy.
It's Dada. Dada.
- Daddy?
- Yes, come on.
Audrey, yeah, it's Daddy.
Come on. Come on.
All right. All right.
Shh. It's OK, it's all right. Yes.
It's all right.
It's all right. It's Daddy.
Yes, it's all right.
Daddy...
Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all because they offend thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve now, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
Mea culpa. Mea culpa.
Mea maxima culpa.
Mrs Templeton.
It's all right.
Why don't you sit down?
Sit down. Try and relax.
This might sting a little.
Mrs Templeton.
Please try and understand, and believe me, I know you don't take the responsibilities of your child lightly, but we are dealing here with something else, something greater than your daughter's physical being or physical welfare.
We're dealing with a soul that is indestructible and yet it is struggling to get free because it is in terrible pain and torment, a pain and torment as real and tangible as the actual physical terror experienced by Audrey Rose at the moment her body was consumed by that terrible fire of 11 years ago.
It's... just... a... nightmare.
Come on, Mrs Templeton, please.
Listen, your daughter is in mortal danger.
Do you know that?
She could possibly die if you don't listen to what I'm telling you.
Now, try to understand.
As long as a soul is unprepared to accept the laws and responsibilities of its karma, it cannot exist in this earth life, it cannot exist on this earth plane. It has to go back.
I don't understand a word you are saying.
It's quite simple, Mrs Templeton.
My daughter's soul returned too soon.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, your daughter?
Her soul? This is my daughter we're talking about, my child.
- It's all right, you don't understand.
- I don't want to understand.
Why, you... You are crazy. You're nuts.
My husband said so and I want you out of here.
- It's just your fear talking.
- No, it is me talking.
I am telling you that my daughter is not possessed.
I'm not talking about possession, but reincarnation.
- Please listen to me. Come here.
- No! No!
I'm not gonna hurt you. Look at me.
What is it you really fear, eh?
Listen to me. Two people, two strangers, came into my life and changed it.
Eric Lloyd was one of them.
He told me a story that was so incredible it took complete hold of me and made my heart search for the very truth of existence itself.
All right, I know, it sounds bizarre.
But I went to India, where I found a way of life that was indescribable.
I found brutalising poverty, starvation, death, pestilence.
But I also found something else.
With all the misery that those people had to face, there was still a great spiritual peace and joy in their lives because they believe... they believe that this life is not the end.
Life and death are not the end.
And I believe that now without a shadow of doubt.
This life, the end? No.
This is one act in a vast cosmic drama, that's all.
Oh, yes, our bodies die, our aged vessels crack, releasing the ensnared soul yet again on its vast journey homewards, through many lifetimes, many lifetimes, improving with each new life.
Not only do I believe this beyond a shadow of doubt, Mrs Templeton, but 700 million other people also believe it.
Please.
Please, won't you open your heart and try to understand what I'm telling you?
Please. Please say you will try.
Please.
What is it you want from me?
I want your trust and your help.
That's all I want.
The soul of a child is crying out for help and we must form a bond, a bond so tight, so filled with all the love that you have, all the love that I have, that we can mend her.
Mend her soul?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Together we can try.
I... I just want to be close to her, to pray for her, to do good for her, that's all I want.
You see, Audrey Rose was only five when she died.
In her brief time on earth, she was just coming to an awareness of the spiritual beauties of life.
I believe if God is willing... only if God is willing... that we can bring her soul back to that awareness.
But I need your help in this.
Look.
We are both a part of this child,
Mrs Templeton.
We both had to do with the making of her.
You and I.
Now, don't turn your back on me now.
Because if you do, you turn your back on Ivy.
Hello?
This is Dr Kaplan, Janice.
You called me?
Oh, yes, Dr Kaplan, I did.
- What seems to be the matter?
- No, no, nothing is the matter.
I'll call you in the morning.
- I'll be at home if you should need me.
- Yes.
- OK?
- Fine.
- Good night.
- Goodbye.
Try and get some sleep.
We'll talk again tomorrow.
Good night.
Thank you.
You let him in, Janice.
You let him in. Why?
- Ivy went crazy, Bill. I needed help.
- Help?
Why didn't you call the office and find out where I'd taken the client?
Or call the elevator man or Russ. Why did you let somebody like that in here?
Bill, Ivy went crazy. She was hurting herself and he was there.
What are you talking about? He's a nut.
He was in the building, and he helped her before.
A nut, that's what he is. He's some kind of a magician. He's got you hypnotised.
He's taken you in. You let him.
Sure I let him. You saw the living room... the furniture overturned, the curtain torn.
What do you think did that, a cyclone?
Our daughter did that. Ivy.
She was out of control, she was crazy, hurting herself, and I couldn't stop her.
You're crazy.
He's gotten you crazy, Janice.
That's right, yes.
He also scares me and he panics me.
But he comes in here and he calls her that name and she hears him.
She listens and goes to him, and just falls asleep in his arms.
- Bullshit!
- Don't you ever say that to me.
Don't ever speak to me that way again.
Where were you when I needed you?
Out drinking with some goddamn client.
- Stop it, Janice.
- Don't you... Don't you touch me.
Stay away from me. You saw her hands.
Why did that happen, Bill?
Why does she scream and cry and yell?
Do you think what's happening to her is normal, for God's sake?
No, it's not normal. Honey, she is sick.
- Baby, we're gonna get help for her.
- He was here. He took care of her.
We'll take her to see the psychiatrist.
- We'll find out what's wrong with her.
- He was here and you weren't.
Oh, baby, honey, I'll be here, from now on I'll be here.
Look, I'll take time off, whatever time is necessary.
Baby, I'll be with you and Ivy. Honey,
I'll be with both of you. I love you.
I love my family very much, honey.
- Here, let's try one more.
- OK.
Mom.
Look, no hands.
If I burned them on the radiator going to the bathroom, how come I didn't wake up?
Because we put ointment on them very quickly and burns only hurt later on.
Oh, yeah, like the time I got sunburnt on the beach last summer.
It took hours to hurt.
My birthday's tomorrow.
Did you pick something nice for me?
Yep, it's all picked, wrapped, ribboned and waiting to be opened.
- How about a pizza and going home?
- With cream soda?
- The works.
- Mom, let's go home.
Come on, Mom, I'm hungry.
Let's go home. We're gonna buy a pizza.
Ivy!
Damn it. Ivy! Ivy!
Janice, help me. Ivy!
It's Kaplan, honey.
Stay with her. Stay with her.
Ivy. Ivy.
- Ah, Mr Templeton.
- How the hell did you get up here?
Please let me explain.
Please, Mr Templeton!
Come on. Please. I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you, you son of a...
- Please. Please.
Please, Mr...
Hurry, call the police.
Stop it! Stop it!
Audrey Rose! Audrey, I'm coming.
Bill!
Oh, my God. Bill, the door. The door.
Get a cop.
The son of a bitch has got my kid.
They're on the way.
- Open the door, you son of a bitch.
- Bill!
Will somebody ring for the elevator and get a pass key?
The guy's a kook, he's a psycho.
Will you hurry?
Bill. Bill, it's all right.
He won't hurt her.
Will you keep out of this?
I've had enough of this bullshit. Hoover!
Dominick, bring me the pass key, come on.
Open up. Hurry.
Hoover!
Hoover!
- Hoover!
- What's the trouble?
A man is in my house with my child.
He assaulted me and he's locked us out.
- Do you know this man?
- His name is Elliot Hoover.
Wait, wait, wait, the service entrance. Of course.
My God, he's taken her. Hoover!
- Stand back here.
- Hoover!
Ivy!
Hoover!
Ivy!
They're gone.
He's kidnapped Ivy.
Just today, Mr Hoover sublet a suite on the eighth floor. Number 802.
This way. Come on.
Hoover!
We'll handle this, sir.
Mr Hoover, I'm a police officer.
Open the door.
Mr Hoover, I will ask you once again to open the door.
- No.
- Open the door, you bastard.
That will do, sir.
Mr Hoover, please open the door.
No. There has been enough insanity for one night.
Is there a child on your premises?
Yes. She's sleeping peacefully.
Does this child belong to this person?
- No, she's mine.
- He has no child.
He's a nut. Now break it down.
Mr Hoover, I will give you
30 seconds to open the door.
Daddy...
My name is Michael Noonan. Police officer first class, badge number 1433.
You're under arrest on suspicion of the felony of kidnapping.
You have the right to remain silent, the right to legal counsel.
If you give up these rights, anything you say will be used against you in a court of law.
Do you understand these rights?
There is nothing more I can do than to ask you to listen to your own heartbeat.
Just feel what you're feeling right now.
Think what you're thinking right now.
You're watching me trying to convince you of things that you don't care about, you don't believe.
But I'm telling you there are lives at stake right now and I tell you from the bottom of my heart this child lives.
She lives!
Audrey Rose lives!
Her soul has crossed over that veil of darkness into a new earth life and now resides in the body of the child who is called Ivy Templeton.
And so, four months after his arrest, and after five hard weeks of jury selection and the presentation of the prosecution's case, the defence of Elliot Hoover finally gets underway.
Among the first witnesses will be Gupta Pradesh, the holy man from Benares, India, the maharishi, whose task it will be to convince 12 American jurors of the truth of reincarnation, which will form the basis of the defence's case... a case unique in the annals of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, a case that has riveted the attention of the entire world.
Many of you look upon death as the ending to life, a leap into an eternal nothingness from which there is no return.
Because of this, you are filled with dread and despair, even rage, at the injustice of death.
We in India are not afraid of death.
Our bodies, because they are material, can die, but the soul, which is spirit, can never die.
That is the difference between matter and spirit.
In India, our belief in reincarnation inspires us to love all people.
For in the course of our numerous rebirths, we have been parents, children and friends to one another.
For us, death is not the end to life, but a momentary separation, a fragile respite in the astral cosmos, where the soul must wait and through meditation seek to clothe itself in the higher spiritual garments before attempting rebirth in the next earth life.
Now, please understand me.
When a person dies in my country and we set flame to the body and watch as it is consumed, we do not grieve for the body that is lost, for the Bhagavad-Gita assures us that as a man casts off worn-out garments and takes new ones, so the soul casts off old bodies and enters into others that are new, and so our minds are freed from the fear of death and we are able to live each earth life in a spiritually productive manner, for we are certain that the end is good and all are blessed, even to the final atom in the scale of being.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!
Freak!
We found it on one of the girls and now it's all over the school.
In spite of everything we tried to do to shield Ivy, we failed.
I'm sorry, Mrs Templeton.
Ivy seems to love it here so.
Her nightmares have lessened and she's been so happy.
Until this.
Will you speak with Ivy and explain to her the truth of the matter?
She doesn't understand and is frightened.
Yes, of course I will. May I keep her with me overnight at the motel?
Certainly.
- Then I am a freak. The girls are right.
- No.
No, no, Ivy, it does not mean that you are a freak.
Now, let me see.
Well, you see, this man, he's a very lonely man.
And he sees something in you that reminds him of his daughter, who he loved very much, but he lost her.
But you can't believe that.
There's no way.
It's just not possible.
Is it possible or not?
Ivy.
Mr Hoover seems to think so.
But...
It can't be true. I'm my own self and I'm not somebody else.
- No wonder the girls are being so mean.
- Oh, Ivy.
I'm so sorry about all of this.
Listen, I'm taking you home with me.
But Sylvester will be crowned day after tomorrow. Can't I stay for that at least?
We've all worked so hard on him.
Well...
You want to?
OK.
I love you.
And yet it'd be really wonderful, wouldn't it, Mom?
It'd be fantastic.
What would be fantastic, babe?
To live for ever and ever and never die.
Wouldn't it be wonderful, Mom?
Yeah.
Yep, it would be wonderful.
It'd be really terrific.
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
Audrey...
Hey, Audrey.
Audrey Rose. Audrey Rose.
Hey, Audrey Rose.
Audrey Rose.
Hey, Audrey Rose.
Audrey.
Audrey Rose.
Audrey. Audrey Rose.
Audrey Rose.
Hey, Audrey.
Audrey.
Audrey Rose.
Hey, Audrey.
Audrey.
Audrey.
Call Janice Templeton.
She knows the truth.
She knows in her heart that I'm her only hope, if her child is to live.
So, please, do as I say and put her on the stand.
Her aim is to put you in jail, Mr Hoover.
Quiet in the courtroom. Rise, please.
Be seated.
Mr Mack, call your next witness.
The defence calls Mary Lou Sides.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in the case now appearing before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
11 years ago, Miss Sides,
1965, October 3rd, you were driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, correct?
Yes.
You were involved in an accident with another car.
Yes.
An accident that left you paralysed.
Yes.
Who was in the other car?
A woman named Sylvia Flora Hoover.
And her daughter...
Audrey Rose.
Now, Miss Sides, I want you to tell the jury exactly what happened that morning, as you saw it.
I was on my way to work, travelling east.
It was stormy.
Sheets of rain and hail.
I couldn't see.
I tried to slow the car down, but it began to skid.
I tried to control the car, but I couldn't, the wheel just twisted around in my hand.
And then there was this car coming toward me.
And we hit each other.
We crashed.
We crashed.
The other car went over the guard rail and down this steep embankment and landed in a gully.
And then I saw...
I saw the face of a girl.
A little girl.
She was looking out of the window of the car.
She was screaming.
Screaming and crying.
"Daddy! Daddy!"
"Daddy! Daddy!"
And all at once the car went up in flames. It was horrible.
And I can see the girl, screaming and beating her hands against the window, and screaming,
"Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!"
Old Man Winter, disappear
Stay away for one more year
Old Man Winter, cold and done
Leave us be, we matter none
Old Man Winter, go away
Stop her! Stop her!
Sister!
Stop her! Stop her!
The child! Stop her!
Stop her!
The child! Stop her!
Stop her! Stop her!
Stop her! The child!
The child! Stop her!
Lucky she was so well bundled and there was all that snow around.
Her body was completely untouched.
Her face took some heat. However, there's no indication of respiratory-tract damage.
Nothing like this has ever happened at St Luke's.
And it needn't have happened this time.
What I'm saying is it was no accident.
Your daughter literally walked then crawled into that fire.
I'd like a muffin.
- Baby.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Please don't touch her.
- Hello, angel.
They said
I walked into the fire on purpose.
- I don't remember anything about it.
- Who said you did that, honey?
- Mother did.
- She's wrong.
What do you build fires for?
What business has that in a convent?
We send our children to you for peace and protection, and you build fires.
- What's happening to me, Daddy?
- It was an accident, honey.
But what made me do it?
Why? Why did I do it, Daddy? Why?
It's all right now, princess.
It's all over, honey.
Janice?
- And you had a visitor that night?
- Yes.
Er... Mr Hoover arrived at the apartment house... er... some time around eleven.
- Did you ask him up?
- Yes.
- Why did you ask him up?
- Well, I needed help.
- But wasn't the doctor coming?
- I needed Mr Hoover's help.
Now, Your Honour, if it please the court.
It has come to my attention that Mrs
Templeton suffered a trauma yesterday, brought about by the injury of her daughter in an accident.
Mrs Templeton is in a highly emotional state.
She should be spared the burden of testifying.
This is a device by the prosecution to prevent the witness from testifying.
He knows that this witness's testimony will destroy the prosecution's case.
Mrs Templeton, do you feel able to continue?
- Yes, I do. I want to continue.
- Proceed, Mr Mack.
Thank you, Your Honour.
And did Mr Hoover help you?
Yes, almost at once.
Ivy seemed to recognise him and rushed into his arms and, as he was comforting her, she fell asleep.
Mrs Templeton... do you believe in reincarnation?
I do now.
Mrs Templeton, do you believe that your daughter Ivy is the reincarnation of Mr Hoover's daughter Audrey Rose?
Yes.
Order!
Mrs Templeton, do you believe that Mr Hoover kidnapped your daughter?
No, I do not.
I believe that the only help my daughter will ever receive on this earth is through Mr Hoover.
The only chance she has of living is if this man is released from jail.
Order!
Order! Order!
Order!
Your Honour, that's our case.
Mr Velie, you may cross-examine.
Your Honour.
In view of Mrs Templeton's testimony, and because of her overwrought condition,
I request a recess until tomorrow morning.
Very well. Court will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9.00am.
Ruth, place a call to Doctors' Hospital in Porchester.
I'd like to speak to the physician in charge of Ivy Templeton's case.
This whole thing is outlandish.
A test like that could not possibly be conclusive and it could prove dangerous to the child.
How about that, Mr Velie?
There is an element of danger here.
Well, the father has granted his permission.
I've been assured by the doctor that she is physically able to withstand the test.
He foresees no problems from such an experiment.
He's even willing to provide the facilities to conduct it.
- Any precedents for such an experiment?
- Yes.
In Wyler vs Fairchild, the court permitted a witness to testify after undergoing hypnosis and did not consider it an abuse of discretion.
He is trying to stampede the jury, a circus show for the sole purpose of ridiculing my client and his beliefs.
All right, let's drop the formalities, boys.
Now, I've given you a hell of a wide latitude in presenting your case.
And now you want me to restrict the prosecution's right to pursue its own path to the truth on rebuttal?
Scott, I don't know about this test of yours.
If I'm gonna permit it,
I want to know the specifications... who's going to conduct it, what his qualifications are, and if there is any possibility of it being harmful to the child.
I think I can satisfy your doubts,
Your Honour.
I'll reserve my decision until you do.
Hello?
Judge Langley's office. Court will convene this morning at Doctors' Hospital.
- The hospital? When?
It's a hypnotic test on your daughter.
- Has my husband given permission?
- Mr Templeton has agreed to the test...
Dr Dorman, you are wanted in emergency.
Judge Langley!
Judge Langley, I object to this test.
I won't have my child submit to it.
Mrs Templeton, I have been personally assured by the psychiatrist that no possible harm can come to your child as a result of the test.
Please, try to understand.
Your husband, who has equal rights of consent in this matter, agrees to the test.
Now, I realise this is a very unusual matter.
When it's ajar.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, sweetheart. Could I have a few moments alone with my daughter?
Why, certainly.
They're going to hypnotise me to find out why I do these things.
You're not going through with it.
I'm not gonna let them do it.
But I want to. I want to know what's wrong with me. I want to know who I am.
Who you are?
You are Ivy Templeton, my daughter.
- But Mr Hoover says I'm his daughter.
- Ivy, you are my child.
I'm not sure any more who I am, Mom.
And I want to know. I've gotta know.
- I am taking you home with me.
- No, I wanna stay.
Janice.
I wanna talk to you outside.
You mustn't let them do this to her.
I know what you want.
To turn my child over to Elliot Hoover.
No, I want what's best for her.
I am doing what's best for her.
Now, if you don't mind, they're ready.
No, please, Bill.
For God's sake, please don't do this.
Don't do what? Destroy the man who's robbing me of my family?
Don't destroy our child.
What we're attempting is unique in the annals of psychiatry.
To regress a subject hypnotically into a former lifetime has never, to my knowledge, fallen with the purview of serious psychiatric inquiry.
True, there are hypnotists who have had subjects claim, under hypnosis, that they've lived before, and that while in the hypnotic state had spoken languages that they did not know in the awakened state.
While I have never participated in nor witnessed such an event,
I am here at the behest of the court to perform a function for which I have been trained and am licensed to perform.
I will be hypnotising the subject who will be brought to me while you watch.
But as observers it is important you stay totally alert and awake, completely alert and awake.
Before I bring in the subject, let me warn you that regression will frequently arouse memories of a traumatic nature.
The subject may even cry out or display bizarre personality changes.
This is normal and to be expected, but will not prove harmful to the child in any permanent way.
We'll now bring her in.
Hello, Ivy. Come over here.
Sit right here, hm?
Thank you.
Now, relax, Ivy.
Relax and allow every muscle in your body to become loose and limp.
Now, as we discussed this morning, you will not be harmed in any way, but would simply begin to feel very relaxed.
Very relaxed.
Very comfortable.
So that you will wish to go to sleep for a while.
You will not mind going to sleep for a while?
- No, I won't mind.
- Good.
Soon you will begin to feel relaxed.
And more comfortable.
More and more comfortable.
Watch the light, Ivy. Keep watching it.
Now, as you're watching it, you're beginning to feel your eyes grow heavy.
Your eyelids are getting heavier, so heavy that you want to close them.
Your eyelids are getting heavier.
And you're finding it harder and harder to keep them open.
Your eyelids are getting so heavy... so heavy... so heavy... that you cannot keep them open.
So heavy... that you must close them.
Must close them... close them... close them.
There.
You cannot open your eyes.
They're so heavy that they simply must stay closed.
You're safe and snug and fully asleep now.
Fully asleep.
When I wish to awaken you,
I will count to five.
I will say "Awaken, Ivy" and you will awaken promptly. Do you understand?
- Yes.
- Good.
Now that you're deeply asleep and completely relaxed, you're gradually moving back in time.
Back, back, Ivy.
Back in time.
You're moving back to your eighth birthday.
When I count to three, you will be back at your eighth birthday party.
You will open your eyes, but will remain deeply relaxed.
Ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
You're now at your party amongst your friends.
Do you see your friends, Ivy?
Tell me about them. Who's at the party?
There's Bettina.
And Carrie.
Mary-Ellen.
The twins.
Peter.
Do you love your presents, Ivy?
Oh, yes, especially my Terry Doll with travel wardrobe.
And my flute game Bettina bought me.
Let's leave this party now and go back to an earlier birthday.
I want you to go back in time to your fourth birthday party.
I will count to three, then you will be at your fourth birthday party.
Just relax, now.
Ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
Did your parents buy you this nice birthday cake with four lovely candles?
No, they didn't buy it.
Too expensive.
Mommy made it from a magazine.
Well, what are you feeling? Let it go.
He broke it.
This little boy broke my monkey.
It's all right, Ivy.
It's all right. We'll leave this party now and we'll move farther back in time.
Farther back. Way back.
I want you to go back to a time when you can see and hear and feel and think... but you cannot say any words.
You're just a little baby in Mummy's arms now.
And maybe she's putting you into your carriage.
Ah, very good, Ivy.
Very good.
Now we're going to go even farther back in time.
Way back.
Way back.
To a time before you were born.
Before you were born.
Before you were born.
Before you were born.
Before you were born.
Before you were born.
Very good, Ivy.
Back. Back, Ivy, back in time.
At a time before you existed as yourself.
The time before you were Ivy.
When you were not Ivy... but you were another person.
To the time just before you were Ivy.
Not Ivy, but somebody else.
Somebody else.
To the last moment you can remember in your previous life.
When you were not Ivy... but somebody else.
Somebody else.
Who are you?
I'm...
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
M...
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy? Mommy?
Mommy? Mommy?
Mommy? Mommy?
Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!
- Mommy! Mommy!
- It's all right.
It's all right, Ivy.
You will leave this memory now.
It's all right. You can go back in time even farther, away from this memory.
- Mommy!
- Ivy!
When I count to three, you will be even farther back in time.
One, two, three.
- Mommy!
- One, two, three.
Can you hear me, Ivy? Can you hear me?
Ivy, can you hear me?
One, two...
Ivy!
Ivy.
Can you hear me, Ivy?
Ivy? Ivy?
Can you hear me?
Ivy?
Can you hear me, Ivy?
She's not Ivy.
Ivy?
She'll be all right, Your Honour.
She'll come out of it.
You will now awaken, Ivy.
When I count to five, you will awaken promptly and feel rested and well.
Rested and well.
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five.
Awaken, Ivy.
Ivy! You will awaken.
Four. Five. Awaken, Ivy.
- She's not Ivy.
- Awaken, Ivy.
Ivy. Awaken, Ivy.
- Daddy, help.
- Four, five.
Awaken, Ivy.
Ivy, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Ivy?
- Audrey Rose!
- One. Two.
Three. Four. Five.
- Two... Ivy!
- I want this test stopped immediately.
When I count to five,
I order you to awaken. One. Two.
Damn it, I want it stopped.
Can you hear me, Ivy?
- Audrey Rose!
- Can you hear me?
- Audrey Rose!
- Ivy!
- Judge Langley, stop the test!
- Audrey Rose!
- Audrey Rose, it's Daddy! It's Daddy!
- Oh, my God!
- One. Two.
- Audrey Rose, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.
- Ivy.
- Do something.
Stop it.
Look, this is the child's mother.
It's all right now.
It's all right. Her soul is set free.
Her soul is set free.
It's all right now.
Her soul is set free.
- No.
- Yes, her soul is set free.
Her soul is free.
Her soul is free.
It is free.
It is free.
Dear Mr Hoover, it is good to know that you are in India doing all the things you must for the peace of our daughter's soul.
I include Bill in my thanks, even though he still cannot accept the idea that while Ivy's body is gone, her soul continues to exist.
Yet I know in my heart it is true and that you are right.
And that is what sustains me.
In permitting you to take Ivy's ashes to India,
I believe that Bill has taken the first step toward understanding that we are all immortal.
Know that I add my prayers to yours for our daughter's soul to mend itself and find the peace and fulfilment in heaven that it was denied in its earth life, and that the day will come when her soul will feel free and able to seek a new rebirth, and that when it does she will find parents who are, oh, generous, understanding, and who will love her as we all loved her.
John Dee.
Some pretty distractions, which you call angels... call forth to forget our cares.
Some aquavit to pass this hard night for our pleasure... and this our gentlewoman.
Your Majesty, as-- as once a virgin, fashioned the whole earth... so by a virgin it shall have rebirth.
So says the old sage, wisdom.
Dear Doctor John... our triumphant antimony... our kingdom's eyes.
This me pleaseth to see and have discourse with angels.
Your Majesty, the spell we cast forth... in the name of Christ Jesus and his angelic hosts... calling forth the fiery, spiritual creature... our angel Ariel.
Metrotron... angel commander of the ten hosts...
I cast for Ariel, pearl of fire... my only star.
God's moonbeam, send forth my flower.
The smoke and ashes of ages past... which hangs like morning mist in veils across the universe... parts in swirls and eddies...
and through them, the shooting star, my angel Ariel...
flies with mirrored eyes, leaving a sparkling phosphorescent trail... across the universe.
Down.
Down he plummets towards Earth... through the great vacuum... on the curve of infinity.
And like a fiery rose, he descends... to Mortlake.
All hail, great master.
Grave sir, hail.
I come to answer thy best pleasure... be it to fly, to swim... to dive into the fire, to ride upon the curled clouds... to thy strong bidding.
Ariel... and all his quality.
This vision exceedeth all expectation.
Such an abstract never before I spied.
An angel, Your Majesty, is the sun's true shadow.
Spirit Ariel...
Her Majesty wishes to have knowledge... to swim in those pure waters... which are the essence of that which bind all creation.
By me... this task shall be performed.
For I am that pure and clarified spirit... by which thou mayest turn all metals... to the most pure gold.
Sweet Majesty, pluck up thy heart... and be merry... for I will reveal to thee... the shadow of this time.
Break it up, kids. 
Get against the wall.
All right. Move.
Right up there. Come on.
Come on!
Quickly!
Run! Come on! Run!
All right, girls.
We are now proud to welcome...
Miss Amyl Nitrate...
England's glory... who's going to tell us the exciting story... of her misspent life.
The world is no longer interested in heroes.
So sad.
We now know too much about them, don't we?
Do you know any real heroes?
No. 
I don't.
Anyway, let me introduce you to... 
Amyl Nitrate.
She's our heroine.
Our school motto is 
Faites vos désirs réalité.
Make your desires reality.
I myself prefer the song,
"Don't Dream It, Be It."
"In those days, desires weren't allowed to become reality.
"So fantasy was substituted for them--
"films, books, pictures.
"They called it 'art.'
"But when your desires become reality... you don't need fantasy any longer, or art."
"I always remembered the school motto.
"As a child, my heroine was Myra Hindley.
"Do you remember her?
"Myra's crimes were, they said, beyond belief.
"That was because no one had any imagination then.
"They really didn't know how to make their desires reality.
"They were not artists like Myra.
"One can smile now at their naïveté.
"When, on my 15th birthday...
"law and order were finally abolished...
"all those statistics that were a substitute for reality...
"disappeared.
"The crime rate dropped to zero.
"Who believed in statistics then?
"Only the vital ones.
"In any case, I started to dance.
I wanted to defy... gravity?"
I haven't danced for a long time.
No one is interested in the ballet anymore.
But history still fascinates me.
It's so intangible.
You can weave facts anywhere you like.
Good guys can swap places with bad guys.
You might think Richard III of England was bad, but you'd be wrong.
What separates Hitler from Napoleon...
or even Alexander?
The size of the destruction, or is he nearer to us in time?
Was Churchill a hero?
Did he alter history for the better?
Now, my friend Mad, on the sofa, is a pyromaniac.
But she thinks she's a revolutionary out to better the world.
I'm not so sure.
The boys in the bed are Sphinx and Angel.
They're from Deptford and brothers.
Their relationship is quite peculiar...
but they're nice enough.
And over there at the wash basin is Chaos, our French au pair.
Life in England these days is inflationary...
but we're carrying on regardless...
coping with misgovernment and idiocy on every side.
Oh, Carnation from Floris.
Not all the good things have disappeared.
Shit! Piss!
- What's up, Amyl? 
- I've broken my Winston Churchill mug.
- Oh, look.
- Oh, Winston!
- Oh. 
- Oh, don't worry. We'll stick him together.
- Got a bit of glue. Don't worry.
- Oh, look.
- You got any glue? Got any glue?
- Yeah, yeah.
"Teach Yourself History, by Amyl Nitrate"
"Number one: 
'The History of England."'
"It all began with William the Conqueror...
"who screwed the Anglo-Saxons into the ground...
"carving the land into theirs and ours.
"They lived in mansions and ate beef at fat tables...
"whilst the poor lived in houses, minding the cows on a bowl of porridge--
"whilst they pushed them around with their arrogant foreign accents.
- There were two languages in the land--" 
- What two languages?
Chinese and Liverpudlian. 
How do I know?
- What about Norman? 
- Norman who?
Oh, fuck off.
"There were two languages in the land, and the seeds of war were sown.
"At first the two sides coexisted...
"meeting only on the racetrack and the battlefield... whilst they fought the rest of the world--"
That's you, Chaos-- 
"who they despised more than each other.
"Now one day, when there was no one left to fight...
"it dawned on them that the real enemy was at home...
and that they should fight themselves.
"Having grown greedy on the booty they had looted from the rest of the world...
"they decided to fight with money.
"But by now this was made with paper, so it was pretty worthless.
"So, when they discovered this... they took to fighting with guns."
"The rest of the world sighed a sigh of relief to be rid of them...
"and got on with their own business... and England slowly sank into the sea."
Who you writing this crap for, Amyl?
Myself.
It's a hobby.
When I'm not making history,
I write it.
I try to compress it.
It'd be great if all history could be written on a Mandrax.
This is how to compress it. 
You forget it!
What are you doing that for?
I'll compress you, you--
Whoo-hoo! 
Oh!
- Ow!
- Fuck off, Mad!
Help me, Sphinx. Amyl's a raving lunatic. 
I'm a damsel in distress.
You clammy slag.
You've sat in the K-Y with your fat arse!
Oh, fuck off!
You get it, Angel. 
The exercise will do you good.
I'm gonna show your brother the real thing.
- Fuck off.
- Oh, fuck off yourself.
Who is it?
It's Bod. 
Shut your eyes, all of you.
Shut your eyes, Angel.
Where'd you get it from?
I captured it in Deptford.
It's high fashion.
Now shall one king rise up against another...
and there shall be bloodshed throughout the whole world.
Fighting between the devil... his kingdom and the kingdom of light.
What'd you say your name was again?
Kid.
- You want some more eggs? 
- No, thank you.
- Want a cigarette? 
- No, thanks.
What do you do?
Nothing. I'm a musician.
You're gorgeous.
I could get you a job with Borgia Ginz.
He's always looking for new talent.
He owns the media.
My name is Crabs, by the way.
I'm an actress.
- Ever see War and Peace?
- No.
- Tea, please.
- Hi, Crabs.
Hello, Viv.
Where have you been all my life?
Now, now, Crabs. 
Don't worry.
She won't take him from you.
She's got me.
I like a girl with talent.
- So where's Amyl? 
- Burning the midnight oil.
Working on her decline and fall.
- Who's that?
- That's Bod.
She's royalty.
Don't like the way she looks. 
My dad had a suit like that.
Um, I think it's kind of nice.
She liberated it from a Russian diplomat...
she fucked at the Dorchester.
After he came, she put his clothes on in the dark.
She found a thousand pounds in the jacket.
Wears it for luck now.
You're a sucker for sex. 
Why don't you keep up with the times, Crabs!
You're an antique, like this place.
- What's the postcard, Mad? 
- It's New York.
And you can forget it.
It just had the bread to con the rest of the world.
America's dead; it's never been alive.
Montelimart.
It had better be.
Why don't you read the label, Bod?
All these ruins.
All this concrete, brick and glass... and the people who made them are utterly forgotten.
The prisons we live in today... might have taken more than a day to build... but it doesn't take long to destroy them.
You cow! 
Get out of my place!
- Oh, cor, cor.
- Oh, look at this!
Come on, Viv. 
Let's split.
Come on, Angel, before she burns the place down.
No one's gonna help you, so help yourselves.
No! Oh, no!
Disgusting.
No. No. Ah.
If your house is ugly, then burn it.
If the street you live in depresses you, then bulldoze 'em down.
And if the cook can't cook, then you kill her. All right?
Ah. 
For a moment, I thought you were gonna kill her.
Just dress rehearsal.
Oh, I was glad to get away. 
Mad's so crazy.
- Not to worry. 
- Well, I know she's right.
- That's what upsets me. 
- Bit bare in here, isn't it?
Well, she's got a bed, doesn't she?
- What you do in here all day? 
- I'm a painter.
An artist.
Very good.
Didn't know there was any artists anymore.
Yeah, there aren't. 
Painting's extinct.
Art isn't.
It's just a habit.
I started painting when I was eight... copying dinosaurs from a picture book.
It was prophetic.
- I'm alive. 
- So am I.
Artists steal the world's energy.
Bet they never get caught.
Always.
They become blood donors.
Their lifeblood drips away... until they're bled dry.
And the people who control the world...
make it as inaccessible as possible...
by driving the artists into corners.
You see, it's dangerous.
Our only hope is to recreate ourselves... as artists or anarchists, if you like... and release the energy for all.
My brother's an artist. 
A piss artist.
Love in a void it's so numb
Avoid in love it's so dumb
Love in a void
- Jaded reputation on which you're staking
- Rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds
Diamonds
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
- De da de da
- What a fucking awful day.
Da dum
Quite New Wave, don't you think?
Oh, give us a break.
I'm gonna make it into a crash helmet.
- That'd give it some use. 
- Mmm.
That would be distinctive. 
Why didn't you steal the pearls as well?
I never liked pearls.
- Or oysters. 
- Yeah.
Pearls are for the pure.
And the world's your oyster, so swallow it.
De dum dum da dum
De da dum de da da da
Diamonds
Diamonds
What's that?
- It's Top of the Pops. 
- What, again?
Yeah, they believe in overkill.
Mmm, he's cute. 
Who is it?
Waiting for our caviar.
Listen
- How should I know?
- I don't take trash to rot
Now come on, you morons.
We have the right to work
- What are we gonna do this evening? 
- We have the right to work
- We have the right to work
- Only thing that's open after 11:00... in this fucking country are the police cells.
Right on, Bod. If you're bored, join the National Front.
Mmm. Why don't you take up embroidery, doll?
There's so little electricity in this country.
Maybe it's fused!
Da da da da dum de da--
Ah, real help at last.
- We'll try the fox-trot
- Hello?
- I'll eat a mango 
- Who?
- You drink a straight scotch
- What?
Most people would hang up.
She's hanging on for dear life.
Oh, yes, I'd love to come.
- Who is it?
- God. Borgia Ginz.
The impresario.
He wants my opinion on his latest find.
- Are you going? 
- Of course.
Oh, how the mighty are... fallen.
She's got no principles.
I thought you were gonna introduce me to Borgia Ginz.
Ah. I don't give away my connections that easily.
You gotta convince me you're worth it first.
And she doesn't need much convincing, dear.
Anyway, I'm going.
Well... she's in for a surprise.
You wanna know my story, babe.
It's easy.
This is the generation who grew up... and forgot to lead their lives.
They were so busy... watching my endless movie.
It's power, babe. Power.
I don't create it.
I own it.
I sucked and sucked and I sucked.
The media became their only reality... and I own their world of flickering shadows.
BBC. TUC. ITV.
ABC. ATV.
MGM.
KGB.
C. of E.
You name it.
I bought them all... and rearranged the alphabet.
Without me... they don't exist.
My God!
It's Amyl Nitrate!
Sieg heil!
She's England's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.
She's my number one.

To you, Elizabeth of England, is granted the greater vision... that man perceives but little and rarely.
Beyond this labyrinth... and the serpent of memory... is the still point of the world... that gateway which men seek.
It is everywhere and nowhere.
It is here and now.
Rounded time turns in a circle throughout infinity.
In you is the beginning and the end... and the forgetfulness beyond.
He who murders will swim in blood... lapping against the bounds of time.
But he who sings with joy... will be continuously greeted with joyfulness.
Every deed you accomplish accompanies you throughout time.
Consider the world's diversity... and worship it.
By denying it's multiplicity... you deny your own true nature.
Equality prevails not for the gods' sake... but for man's.
Men are weak... and cannot endure their manifold nature.
Yes.
He's great, isn't he? 
I picked him up at the roadblock.
- What's your name?
- Happy Days.
Where are you from?
World's end.
Why do you encourage them, Crabs?
You'll only get the clap.
Tough shit, you virgin queen.
Where were you last night?
Anyway, I like him. 
He's got a great arse.
Yeah, he's a real sex object.
A real cute sex object.
Uh! Back to work!
No tea breaks!
For Christ's sake, Crabs, leave off!
What do you see in these damn studs anyway?
Hey, you.
Why don't you push off!
- Oh, leave the guy alone. 
- Fuck off!
He's better than a vibrator and bigger.
You are. 
Don't worry about her.
Her parents were Christians. 
She was born with a hang-up.
Ah! 
- I'm coming! 
- Hang on!
Oh, another hit-and-run merchant!
Just hold it, mate, or it's curtains for you! 
Don't you spurt.
We'll pound you.
They all want to cream as quick as a flash of zipper.
It's a lower form of life.
Christ. Blue movies for breakfast is more than I can stomach.
Oh, I like to watch.
- Fuckin' hell. 
- Oh, neat.
Just right, man. 
Hold it.
You fucking bitch! 
Look at this!
Get off, you--
Oh, neat, neat, neat. 
Perfect. That's it.
Do you think he's dead?
Dial 9-9-9.
Right.
One, two, three.
- And-- 
- Wait. Hold on. Wait. Christ.
- Heave-- 
- Heave ho!
- Makes me rather sad. 
- Oh, cut it out, Crabs.
Mm. Just for a moment, 
I thought he was the one.
Go on. Laugh. 
I really did.
Shit, your mind's really blown, Crabs.
- Why are you all against me? 
- We're not.
We're just trying to save you... from yourself!
Yeah, your mind's like a faded collage... of Penthouse and true romance.
Just for a moment 
I fell in love with him.
Love snuffed it with the hippies.
Sex is for geriatrics.
The mindless.
O, my love is like
A red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June
O, my love
Is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
So fair art thou my bonnie lass
So deep in love am I
And
I will love thee still, my dear
Till all the seas gang dry
Well, Viv, it's your turn now.
We're steppin' back.
Us boys, we've been in the limelight now... five thousand years.
Great, isn't it?
He hands over to you just as time's running out.
- Oof.
- When there's no chance.
That's what I call friendship.
Well, I mean, the end's inevitable.
It's either now or later.
It's what makes the present so vital.
Take your partners for the last waltz.
I love you.
And I Iove you, Angel.
I love you both.
Both of you.
You seem to have got things sorted out.
Well, why look for anything else?
Life's too short.
All that desperate search for one place... that's better than the next.
And I will come again
My dear
Tho' it were
Ten thousand mile
My brother's great, isn't he?
- Ha!
- Perfect.
It's a nice day.
Let's go out.
Piss off.
It's the biggest studio in the world, Kid.
Borgia bought it from the liquidator.
Christ, it's huge!
Borgia does everything with style.
You didn't believe me, did you?
S-Sir... that was W-Wall Street.
They say the dollar's crashing since you withdrew your support.
I'm not interested... in peanuts economy, Schmeitzer.
Now, let's get down to the real business.
Committing a murder in the overcrowded cage
Well, sir, we've sold 50 million copies of "Paranoia Paradise"... in Moscow alone in the last three days.
Lounge Lizard's number one.
As long as the music's loud enough... we won't hear the world falling apart.
Black is black white is white
Life is life, baby nine to five
Oh, excuse me, sir.
There was a message earlier from M-Madame Mao.
She said she wanted to be in a film.
She won't be in this one.
I can assure you.
The alien way to every word you say
Is an inspiration to an uninspired day
Black is black white is white
E-Excuse me, Mr. Ginz... but it's Miss Crabs to see you.
Hi there, Borgia.
I hope I'm not interrupting, but, uh, this is strictly business.
I've been doing a little talent scouting for you.
He's called The Kid, but he's pure sex.
I'm gonna be his manager.
- Mmm. 
- Well.
What can I do for you?
Or rather... what can you do for me?
Hello, Mr. Gi-Ginz.
Oh! You see?
He's a natural!
He's gonna be the new Garbo!
Garbo is very p-profitable.
I'll take him into the theater... and audition him.
Just for you, Crabs.
I'll call Bod.
She'll be so jealous.
I don't care about the money.
- I just don't wanna get ripped off.
- Oh! Shh.
Please let me see the light of day
Turn it on an island in my you don't understand
They don't care
They don't see
There's a light in the nigh for people like me
Oh, you useless prat.
I know where there's some lovely flowers.
Really?
- Where?
- Max's.
It's a bit far, isn't it?
We can go by car.
Good old Max.
You'll love him.
- Hello, Max.
- Hi, Max.
This is Viv.
She's a friend.
- Hello, girl.
- Hi.
Okay. Come in.
We're round the back.
- Watch your foot, son.
- Praying for rain, eh?
- Hello, Bod.
- Hello.
- What a crazy garden, Max.
- Yeah.
I had a bad case of weeds, so I sprayed it all with poison.
It looked a bit sad then, so I planted all these plastic petunias.
Max has been telling me about his adventures as a mercenary, since he left the army.
Aw, the army was a fucking con.
It was a way of solving the unemployment problem... before they gave up entirely.
You're more likely to die of red tape in the Guards than a bullet.
I ran a sideline, sellin' the boys to the local punters in the pub.
The army sees more action in bed these days.
Ah, no.
Damn it.
This carnation's got mildew.
Yeah, we never got a chance to kill anyone in the army... so I used to kill the weeds in the garden of an evening instead.
- Yeah, it must have been frustrating in the army.
- You're not kiddin'.
Just think. We're sittin' on enough megatons to blast a sunrise into the west... and no one's prepared to press the fuckin' button.
It's a bleedin' waste. I mean, think what it all cost. I pay my taxes.
The're probably so bored...
- they haven't got the energy.
- Yeah.
War got so big... it lost all contact with people.
Yeah, well, the reaction's set in. 
It's moved back onto the streets.
Politicians helped, though.
They demoralized everyone so much talkin' about devalued money... as if it was all most of us cared about.
Their popularity died with the pound.
It's funny how, when you try for one thing, you end up with another.
Personally, though,
I prefer the world dead.
I mean, it's cleaner.
My idea of a perfect garden... is a remembrance poppy field.
There's a caterpillar.
There's a fucking caterpillar in the tulips.
Ew!
What the hell.
It's full of protein.
Hey, come down to the bingo parlor tonight.
You might win a prize..
- Right.
- Ta-ra!
- See you down there. Ta-ra! Ta-ra!
- Ta-ra!
Fuckin' kids.
Little ears will be much better
When you are a r-r-real go-getter
Gonna take you down all the way
Ooh ooh ooh
Plastic surgery
- It's so
- Plastic
Plastic surgery it's fantastic
You better take me away, yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah
So don't go sitting in the sun
Your new face might start to run
Just forget your makeup scheme
Clean your face with Mr. Sheen
Ooh, I'm gonna
Take you down to Harley Street
Plastic surgery
It's so plastic
Oh, yeah 
Plastic surgery
- It's fantastic
- Fantastic
I'm gonna take you down 
I'm gonna take you down
Take you, take you down 
Oh, I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down to
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ooh, la-la-la
You're signed up!
Now... what are we going to call you?
S-S-Scum!
That's it! That's it.
Scum.
That's commercial.
It's all they deserve.
- You're great.
- Uh, plastic surgery.
Really, you're great.
Now take my advice.
Keep away from her.
She'd sell her soul for a couple of inches.
Look. 
The music industry's dead.
You're better off on the streets.
It's not worth it.
He'll steal your voice... and sell it.
He doesn't care if the mindless public hears your words or not.
He just wants to package you.
When he's through with you, you'll just be another face on another cover. Hey.
Why don't you come along and sing to me, huh?
And the devil came unto him... and took him to a very high place.
And he showed him all the boroughs of London.
And then the devil said...
"I'll give you all this... if you'll go down on your knees."
And he answered, knowing full well... it was built by the 
Department of the Environment... and was a rip-off...
"Fuck off, Satan."
And Satan left...
- and an angel came...
- Yeah? and ministered unto him.
Oh!
That's where Angel and I was born.
I never lived below the 14th floor... till I was old enough to run away.
Never saw the ground till I was four.
Just locked alone with the telly all day.
First time I saw flowers,
I freaked.
I was frightened of dandelions.
Me old gran picked one once.
I had hysterics.
Everything in that tower block was regulated.
Planned by the social planners... to the lowest common denominator.
Sight: concrete.
Sound: the telly.
Touch: plastic.
Taste: plastic.
Seasons regulated by thermostat.
Once a year, me mum and dad... dusted down the plastic Christmas tree... and exchanged pathetic presents.
Didn't know I was dead till I was 15.
Never experienced love or hate.
My generation's the blank generation.
Hmm, two.
Home and dry.
It's my lucky day.
And you threw a double.
Hmm. I've won a beauty contest.
Second prize.
- Oh.
- You'd only win second.
- First.
- Collect £10 from each player.
And quick.
I'll trade Whitehall for Piccadilly.
- Don't do it, Crabs.
- Oh, shut up.
I'll give you Piccadilly...
£200 cash-- ahhh-- a deal under the table...
- and... all of British Rail.
- Ah!
What's a nice girl like you doing trading Piccadilly?
You'd be lost without it.
I'm spaced.
Let's call a halt.
- Amyl will win in any case.
- Win what?
Anyone who can afford to build hotels on the Old Kent Road's bound to.
I'm gonna make some tea.
Anybody want any?
- Uh-uh.
- Mm-mmm.
Go get the black book, Amyl.
Let's plan the future.
Good-bye, baby, and amen!
Couples. 
What could be better than that?
Singles.
Must be something pretty in here somewhere.
There you are.
What about meeting him on a dark night?
Fuck. There's no one left.
They're all dead.
Success!
Who's that?
Lounge Lizard.
You think he's still alive?
Never heard of him.
Ew. He looks like death.
Kiss of death.
The world won't miss his missing... chromosome.
You're crazy, Bod.
I love you!
Let's go!
Come on, Chaos.
Let's get Lounge Lizard.
Go on, Crabs.
- Whoo!
- Let's go, Crabs!
Oh, I'm on TV again?
Oh, my big hit.
This earned me millions.
Late last night after I went to bed
I got a demonic feeling in my head
Yes, I did.
And you know--
Something pulled my legs apart
And I felt it right up to my heart
- Paranoia
- Paranoia
- Paradise
- Paradise
It's sure gonna be the death of me
- Ask Adam and Eve
- Ask Adam and Eve
Now, Eve didn't think that the devil was bad
No, the naughty boy.
But to her he was an angel that just turned bad
No, red. Red is the word. 
But what about communism?
Part of God's heaven is what the devil had
God.
God kicked the devil out
It doesn't matter.
I'm so rich. I'm filthy rich.
- I could eat my own glasses.
- Paranoia
Ooh, that was a no-no.
- Paradise

Oh, yes. Uhh.
A star shines forever.
Stars never go out.
The galaxy is full of stars.
True stars.
Remember the days.
Good evening, backstage.
This is Miss Slaughter here... bringing you the very latest and important world events.
And tonight we have...
Lounge Lizard... who's granted us an exclusive interview... from the privacy of his own home!
First of all, Lounge... tell me what it's like... to be dead.
Boring!
I'm gonna vomit.
I bet you're loving it!
Oh, I love it.
Fucking great!
I am sorry.
However, we do allow you to take... seven records with you... of your own choice.
What a taste.
What a buzz.
Amyl, give us a Coke.
Give us a Coke, Amyl.
A great chill embraceth this place.
Your Majesty, by our leave.
'Tis a true marvel.
What signifieth this corpse?
A dark parable it is... to my understanding.
Light and dark, hot or cold... living... or dead... mankind is attracted by the polarities.
Seeing or not seeing.
Sweet angel... little I thought to be thus transported from my dear England.
Spirit Ariel... we would have knowledge of God.
Please Your Majesty.
Gaze deep into the crystal.
We...
Elizabeth of England... a feather in the wind of time... pray for knowledge of God... from the deep whirlwind of shadows...
on the edge of the abyss.
Where is God?
Is God dead?
Save your souls, ladies and gentlemen.
The greatest live show on Earth.
Save your soul. Welcome to the palace of heavenly delights.
And did those feet
In ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green
And was the Holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills
And was Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Builded here
Among these dark satanic mills
And here's the man who made it all possible.
Cardinal Borgia Ginz.
The man who picked up the 30 pieces of silver...
and made the movie you saw on TV.
This is your last chance, folks.
So come on in.
Borgia Ginz is giving up the theater and going into the car park business.
Without progress... life would be unbearable.
Progress has taken the place of heaven.
It's like pornography:
Better than the real thing.
They prefer the shadows.
The light's too cruel for them.
They're all working for me... and they follow blindly... under life insurance.
Sent me
To give you
A little
Bit of sympathy
Ooh, I'm gonna
Hey, Mad, do you wanna hear my new chapter, "Civilization"?
What, are you gonna serialize it?
Hold it everybody. Another Mandrax history lesson from Amyl!
Oh, fuck off. 
Here goes any case.
"On human rights:
Human beings have no rights...
"but some dumb fuck's told them they have them.
"First political rights-- freedom of speech and things like that.
"And if that wasn't enough, they were told they had material rights too.
"They forgot about the political rights soon enough...
"but they got hooked on the material ones.
"One desolate suburban acre and a car...
"then a TV, fridge...
"and another car.
"That was by right, mind you, but the habit demanded more and more.
"The day came when the expectations couldn't be fulfilled any longer...
"and everyone felt cheated.
"So here we are in the present-- fucking great--
"with civilization destroyed by resentment.
"But since civilization itself was always fucking awfully boring for everyone...
"who gives a shit?
We can do without it."
Plastic surgery
It's fantastic
You better take me away
Yeah
- Oh, yeah
- Get the salt, Mad.
All right.
Hmm, it's a really neat job, isn't it?
A bit permanent.
- I can't find any salt.
- Oh, it's on the shelf.
- Is it behind the HP?
- Go and show her where it is, Viv.
- She's as blind as a bat. 
- They're all the same.
Oh, that live show was fucking awful.
- Where's that Borgia Ginz at?
- Nowhere.
- Yeah, where do they get those guys from?
- Oh, they dope them.
- Plastic surgery
- I saw them in the vestry.
- It showered Librium.
- Yeah, it was a real rip-off.
- It's for wankers.
- Yeah.
Oh, they're gonna take you down
Gonna take you down to oooh
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, ah, ah, ah
It's all fucking nostalgia.
It's the only way they can get through the day-- avoiding pure action.
It's the entertainment business, isn't it?
Easy come, easy go.
Yeah, well. I'm going bingo.
I promised Max.
I'm staying in.
I've got better things to do.
I'm gonna get zapped.
I really like TV when I'm stoned.
Yeah, well, I'm going bingo.
Come on, Kid.
Come on, Angel.
- You coming, Viv?
- No, I think I'll stay here.
Come on.
There's nothing here for you.
Come and have some fun.
- Okay.
- Whoo!
Come on. 
See ya!
Ta-ra.
Come on.
Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to Max's 
Bingo Palace. It's a laugh a minute.
Okay, now. 
Eyes down for the full house.
Lots of lovely prizes tonight.
First prize donated by General Idi Amin.
One of the privates got a chop last week.
We're not prejudiced here, you know. 
Second prize: tin of baked beans.
Offer definitely not to be repeated.
Okay. Let me get me balls untwisted and away we go.
And the first one's a white.
Five and six-- 56.
And a white again.
Four and nine-- 49.
And a white.
Five and four-- 54.
And a red.
On its own, number eight.
And a red. 
Legs 11.
And a white. 
Four and eight.
And a green.
One and nine-- 19.
And a white.
Five and nine-- 59.
And a blue.
Three and one-- 31.
And a white.
Four and four-- 44.
God rest Jayne Mansfield. 
And a blue. Three and five--
'Ere. They got Maureen.
I know. 
She had the look.
You can tell, you know.
Oh, ain't it a shame?
Oh, don't be so sentimental, Joyce.
I know, but she was so young.
I know, but what did you expect?
She never carried a gun.
- Not even a knife.
- I know. She couldn't get used to it.
I told her last week in Sainsbury's,
"At least a hatpin, Maureen."
They threw the toaster in the bath, and she was electrocuted.
Oh, my God!
What do you expect with millions unemployed?
- Nothing. 
- Fuck all!
And it's white.
Five and five-- 55
And it's white.
'Ere, I won one of them inflatables last week for Fred.
Funny, three of us in the bed.
You ought to give it to Ted.
He'll be lonely without Maureen.
- Yeah.
- And it's white again.
Oh, my God! 
I've won! House!
The lovely lady in the white hat.
Three months' supply of jubilee knickers. 
Red, white and blue.
- What the 'ell do I do with them?
- Well, worth a quid.
Special Branch.
What the hell's going on?
- Special Branch. Nobody move.
- Come on. Give us a kiss.
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.
Yours.
This'll put an end to your history lessons.
- Hysterectomy touché. 
- Ow. Ooh, fuckin' hell.
Do you want any help, Amy!?
I got through life with brains... and a pair of fists.
Fists?
I just have to look.
- Okay. You're on.
- Come on then.
You rubber Medusa.
On my right we have...
Miss Amyl Nitrate.
And on my left...
Mad Medusa.
And may the best man win.
Oh, my fucking jaw!
Oh!
What are you doing in my chair?
The bingo--
They just--
They just killed the boys.
Like your charm, princess.
Yes, we are.
I need a piss.
Here you are, Viv. 
A toast for Angel.
And another one for Sphinx.
Come on. Don't cry.
Crying won't change anything. 
It's a negative reaction.
Help me make these firebombs instead.
It'll make you feel better.
We'll show those bastards.
You wait and see.
Fuck you, Mad!
Do you wanna kill us?
Britannia
Britannia rules the--
Oh, this'll put us in the mood.
Burn, burn, oblivion. R.I.P.
We'll get those bastards.
We'll corner 'em.
It's party time.
Let's liberate the zoo.
Where's the razor? 
Where's the razor?
I'm gonna castrate him!
Bastard!
I'll kill him!
Crawl! Crawl!
Crawl!
We'll kill you now!
Crawl!
Crawl!
Watch him crawl!
Crawl!
Bastard!
You fucking bastard!
Of course they've discovered the, uh-- the new chocolate substitute.
Sir, would you mind if put my stuff in with yours?
I haven't got much.
You know, I'd hate to waste a machine.
- Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.
Hoopla.
Where'd you get the T-shirt?
Oh, T-shirt I pinched at, uh, Seditionaries.
Mmm.
So do you always take your clothes off in the launderette too?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm. Très chic.
Must have cost a bomb.
Did you get it in the King's Road?
Mmm. So what are you doing after the spin dry?
Nothing.
I just love a man without his uniform.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm, sure is the special branch.
Let's get married.
Yeah. 
Could have kids.
Lots of boys like you.
I want to settle down.
I think I've fallen in love.
What do you do?
- I'm an actress.
- Mm-hmm.
In between jobs at the moment.
Did you ever see Rock Follies?
No.
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Shit. I'll get it.
No future!
Oh, li la. La, la.
The wheel turns.
In his hands... the roses of ecstasy burn.
The ashes are upon his brow.
Waters of Leith steal upon the golden-eyed.
He dances into silence.
Oh, li la. La, la.
Color deserts the world.
I am... the mirror-- the fire that consumes all that is created.
I bring the winter of thy flowers... and the frost that secretly destroys the temple.
Halt! Halt! Halt!
Blacks, homosexuals and Jews are banned in Dorset.
Section one. Passport.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Any seditious literature, records, tapes?
Hey, hold it.
That's my Elvis album.
That's on the blasphemous list too.
Right. On your way.
My God, the English Customs are deplorable.
It used to be just the color of your skin.
They have to be tough to keep the riffraff out.
Dorset's the only safe place to live now.
It's tragedy that socialism and freedom weren't compatible.
It's wonderful, Borgia.
Is it all yours?
It used to belong to some aristocratic family.
I requisitioned it.
Oh, well. 
Carnation from Floris.
Not all the good things have disappeared.
Sieg heil. Sieg heil.
Borgia, darling, can I have a tank?
It would be just perfect for a Saturday afternoon stroll down the King's Road.
Of course, darling.
You're my number one.
I'll make millions out of you.
This is my first trip to the country.
It's really exciting.
I mean, all those trees... and the animals!
I have a passion for fur.
They all sign up in the end, one way or another.
We lost Lounge Lizard... and gained the Daughters of God.
Crabs...
Amyl...
Maddie!
Oh, my heart rejoiceth... in the roar of the surf on the shingles.
Marvelous, sweet music it is to my ears.
Oh, what joy there is in the embrace of water and earth.
Yea, a great elixir is the seashore.
Here one can dream of--
of lands far distant and the-- the earth's treasure.
The sea remindeth me of youth.
Oh, John Dee, do you remember those days?
The whispered secrets at Oxford... like the sweet sea breeze?
Codes and counter-codes.
The secret language of flowers.
I assigned myself with rosemary... a true alexipharmic against your enemies.
And I with celandine... true gold of the new spring of learning.
You were my eyes then as now with your celestial geometry.
You laid a path through treachery... and opened my prison so that my heart flew like a swallow.
Sweet Majesty... to me you are the celandine now as then before... balm against all melancholy.
Hmm. Ah... but I was young then.
There and back.
There and back.
The waves break on the shores of England.
The white cliffs stand against the void.
We gaze seaward...
contemplating the night journey.
The sun sinks lower.
The moon waits to make her entrance.
In the south at Tilly Whim...
a picture of wind on the sea.
In the west...
a vision of silver dew falling into a chalice...
flowing on a sea of pure gold.
In the east...
a black hoarfrost--
the sun eclipsed by the wings of the phoenix.
In the north...
a howling chaos into which a black rain falls without ceasing.
Now... is the time of departure.
The last streamer that ties us to what is known... parts.
We drift into a sea of storms.
And now Elizabeth and Dee go along...
the same great highway...
and the light of the air about them seemed somewhat dark...
like evening or twilight.
And as they walked...
the phoenix spoke...
and cried with a loud voice:
"Come away."
THE MAGIC FLUTE
OVERTURE
ACT I
Oh, help me, ye gods, will my prayers never reach you?
Deliver me now from this beast, I beseech you
Ye gods, show me mercy
It's drawing so near
So terribly near...
Oh, help me now
Oh help and protect me now
Die, vicious beast, die by the spear
Oh joy!
No wall his fear can disappear
He is released
Our valor saved him from the beast
This is indeed a youth most fair
Such beauty in a man is rare
Indeed, he has a graceful air
Could I by love enchanted be this youth alone could capture me
Now to the Queen.
We must not linger
This joyful message we must bring her
Would that this youth a way could find to give her back her peace of mind
So hasten now, you two.
I'll guard him hereforyou
No,you go. I must say it's better that I stay
What is this all about?
I'll do the watching out
I'll guard him here fo ryou
- It's better that I stay
- I'll do the watching out
- I'll guard him
- I'm staying
I'll watch him
Is that so?
I am to go?
Oh no!
Oh no - ah, that is so?
I am to go?
She would thus be rid of us
Oh no!
Oh no, I shall not go
To have him formy very own now if we were only left alone now if they would leave him here with me
But no -alas.
It shall not be
And if that's so I'd better go
I'll go, I'll go
Adonis, keeper of my heart
Now fare thee well forwe must part
Farewell,we'll meet again
Farewell
We two will meet a new
A fowler gay in me you see
There are not many more like me
I am a well-known person here belov'd wherever I appear
I play my pipe and at the sound all kinds of birds do flock around
By catching birds I earned my fame and Papageno is my name
Of course I'm happy in my trade but I get lonesome for a maid
Alone I wander all day long and only birds can hear my song
No girls come flocking
'round my feet although my melody is sweet
I want a maiden of my own to have and keep for me alone
Now you frightened him. I catch birds for the Queen of the Night
So this is her territory?
Have you ever seen her?
You must be mad. She wouldn't show herself to just anybody
-Whatareyou staring at?
-Ofcourse
You saved mefrom the dragon
Dragon, indeed
Well,the main thing is someone killed it
- But how? You're unarmed
- I've gota strong fist
Papageno!
Now in today.
Only water...
And no cake.
Butyou may have a stone
No sweet figs either. But pray, accept this padlock for your lips
Prince Tamino, be still
Our Queen sends you this locket with her daughter's picture
If you are not indifferent to her features then bliss, honor, and fame await you
The beauty of this wondrous face divine in all its tenderg race a feeling is aroused in me
A hope of bliss and ecstasy
I can'tcomprehend this wistfuly earning
Butmy bewildered heart is burning
Can it be love, this mystery?
It is
I know that itmust be
I know it, I know it
What else but love could it be?
Where does she dwell, my heart's desire?
How might I best her love inspire?
If only now my dream came true
What is mydream?
Thatshewere here so I could face her
And with a lover's gentle arms embrace her
Then she would beforevermine then she would be forever mine
-The path to fortune lies open
-Our Queen has heard every word
She has read your heart
At last, she feels certain her daughter can be rescued
Pamina was abducted bya mighty sorcerer
She lay asleep under the cypresses one day when Sarastro crept up to her
Yes, he is a devilishly cunning man with many different guises
And he lured Pamina away
I shall rescue her,
I swear by my love
Listen,Tamino - Do you hear a distant thunder?
- Nightfalls over the mountain
- Our Queen is coming
No need tofear, mydearestfriend
Your heart is gentle daring pure
And you alone have the strength and power to aid a mother in her darkest hour
Life holds for me but grief and sorrow since my dear child was lured away
Now gray and cloudy dawns each morrow
A want on deed destroyed my peace of yesterday
The memory still daunts me
Forever it haunts me
Her vain protestation her sad lamentation
I heard her crying in the distance
Oh, help!
In vain she had to plead
I could not come to her assistance
I failed her in her hour of need
My power failed me in her hour of need
You must go through hell and through high water
Perilous land you must explore
Yes, perilous land you must explore
But if you bring me back my daughter then she is yours forever more
Then she is yours... forever more
Do I sleep or do I wake?
Is this a dream or reality?
Your punishment was prompt indeed but I think they were too hard on you
It's hardly pity that you need but alas, there's nothing I can do
Our Queen, so merciful and wise now pardons you fortelling lies
- Hey listen - Papageno'stalking
- Now do beware of telling lies
- I'll never tell another lie
-The padlock is your reason why the padlock is my reason why
Oh that the lips of every liar could thus be sealed and locked forgood
Instead of malice, hate, and ire we would have love and brotherhood
My Prince, accept this giftfrom me, a present from Her Majesty
A magic flute she now has sent you foryour protection on this venture
Just play, and you may take for granted your listeners will be enchanted
The sad will feel the joy of life
The bachelor will seek a wife
Such a magicflute is a treasure of tremendous worth
For by its sound man is inspired to live in peace with all on earth
It is time for me to go now
- Ladies. Now good bye to you.
- Notsofast
We'll let you know now what our Queen wants you to do
With the Prince, go on your way now to Sarastro. No delay now
No, indeed, I must decline.
That's not really in my line
To Sarastro...Thank you, no.
If our venture should miscarry he would have me plucked and roasted and then feed me to the crow
Why feel alarm? -The Prince will keep you safe from harm
Oh that the Prince would goto blazes - My life is dear to me
I do not trust their pretty phrases.
They are no guarantee
-A small advance is onlyfair
-Well, well, what is in there?
These little bells that sweetly tingle
And could I also make them jingle?
But of course - yes, certainly!
Flute of magic, bells of vision keep us safe upon our mission
Now good luck, you fearless men
Now farewell, we'll meet again
But we don't know the way.
Pray tells. where does this vile Sarastro dwell?
We are three spirits to attend you
Our help and counsel we will lend you
Just keep in mind that you'd bewise always to do as we advise
They are three spirits to attend us
Their help and counsel they will lend us
Just keep in mind that you'd be wise always to do as we advise
It's time that we went on our way
Farewell, we'll meet another day
We'll meet again
We'll meet again
- Now, Pamina. Caught at last
-Oh, my heart, don't beat so fast
- Don't think you'll ever leave
- It's not for myself I grieve
But my poor mother'll die, I fear from losing one she held so dear
Pamina, you will be locked in so that you can't escape us
I'd rather have you kill me
Barbarian!
Now strike me down
Away, away!
Now let us be alone
This puzzles me - whose house is this?
But look- there is Pamina.
This is too good to miss
Good evening, my dear girl
Say, what is going on here?
This surely isthefiend himself
Yes,this must bethefiend himself
- Have mercy!
- Me? Mercy?
- Please spare me now!
- I? Spare you now?
Go
-Who are you?
-The Queen ofthe Night sent me
- My mother...What's your name?
- Papageno. But let me check first
"Beautiful eyes"...yes
Though a little red
"Fair hair"... it is fair
"Red lips"...your lips are red
Everything's right
Except the feet. ccording to this picture, you don't have feet
Where did you get that?
A long story. I'm keeping it for the Prince
-What Prince?
- I'm notsure
But here is his picture
Your mother took to him at once and asked him to free you from Sarastro
I've come before him
Tamino is in love with you
Tamino, in love with me?
Then why is he not here?
We've been looking separately.
A bird showed metheway
What time is it? Sarastro will be home any minute now. Come
-Sarastro? Was he the cad?
- No. His servant, Monostatos
- If you knew
- I can imagine. He looked a real -
So he is.
Come, we must hurry
How do I know you're no tone of Sarastro's evil spirits?
Me? Why, I'm the best spirit in the world
-You do look good-hearted
-That's for sure. But hurry now
Anyway, what do I want with a heart?
When I think that Papageno still has no Papagena...
Not even a girlfriend to share my merry moments with
-You'll soon find a sweetheart
- I'll tell you one thing, though
A man by gentle love inspired will have a heart that's kind and good to listen to his heart's desires
How sweet the lot of womanhood
For love will warm us day and night
Love is the source of true delight
Love brings relief in pain and sorrow
It soothes a soul in misery
Love holds the key to each tomorrow
In it is born Eternity
For love's sweet sake the world began
Woman and man, thus love began
Love is pure and love is bright
Lovers are each other's light
Heaven doth them both unite
This path will lead you to your goal
If you pay heed to this expedient
Here are the rules: don't lose control
Be stead fast silent and obedient
But listen, tell me first, you three
When will Pamina be set free?
We must not tell, no use to plead
Be stead fast, silenta nd obedient
Obey the rules and you will succeed if you make use of this expedient
I strongly feel it would bewise for me to do as they advise
Where am I now?
Which path is right?
And could this be a godly site?
The gates and the columns, their towering beauty would point to a reign of art, wisdom and duty
Where art is protected and beauty may dwell the people are happy, the master rules well
Alone I shall venture to open the door
My purpose is noble, my motives are pure
Sarastro, mark these words, you scum
To save Pamina
I have come
Stand back
Stand back?
I'll try another door
Stand back
The same words as before
One single entrance is left
Now shall I be dismissed once more?
Bold stranger, pray,what do you want?
What brings you to this sanctuary?
I seek the mistress of my heart
A worthy cause, it would appear
And yet you will not be admitted
It isn't love that brings you here
To evil powers you have submitted
Revenge on the barbarian!
In our company you won't find him
Sarastro, is he not your leader?
Oh yes, Sarastro rules these parts
But surely not the Temple here?
Oh yes, he rules the Temple here
Then all must be hypocrisy
So you would leave us now?
I want to leave. -Yes, begone, gone from deceit and fraud
What do you mean byt hat?
Will you explain yourself?.
Sarastro rules here.
That is enough forme
If life is dear to you, then speak now. Tell me all
-Sarastro you abhor?
- I loathe his very name
- He is a great and holyman
- He is a tyrantand a brute
You sufferfrom a misconception
The victim of his vile deception told me Sarastro stole her child
That woman would have you beguiled
Her venom poisons every word
And you believe what you have heard?
If Sarastro now were here then he could make his purpose clear
Well, it's obvious to me
Am I erroneously instructed?
Pamina, was she not abducted?
That's correct, yes I agree
Where is she?
Still alive and well?
Or is she dead?
What have they done?
Be patient yet a while, my son
I am instructed not to tell
Explain this puzzle.
Tell me now
I'm still obliged to keep my vow
But when am I to know the answer?
As soon as it is understood that you shall join our brotherhood
Oh endless night you never lighten
When will the darkness ever brighten?
Soon or never evermore...
Soon or never, did they notsay?
You hidden spirits, answer me if yet Pamina lives
Pa -mi - na is alive
Yet alive?
I thank you forthatword
Oh that my voice injubilation could sing your praise and exaltation,
Almighty Ones, I'd thus impart the feeling of relief in my heart
What power in your gentlev oice sweet flute ofmagic
For you rtones so soft and tender a heaven here on earth engender
What power in your gentle sound
Your voice isfull of magic splendor
For your tones so soft engender on earth a blissful heaven...
But-my Pamina my Pamina does not hear
My Pamina is not here
Pamina!
Pamina!
Hear me, hear me now
In vain...
Where?
Where? Pray tell, where can you be?
Ah,that is Papageno's flute
Perhaps she's coming here with him
Yes, she has heard my melody
She heard my flute
My darling will be free
The flute will bring her here to me
Fearless hearta nd nimble feet make for a discreet retreat
Oh, Tamino, hurry now, or they'll get us any how
Oh Tamino, hurry, hurry now
Or they'll get us, get us, get us any how
Come, Tamino
Wait a minute, maybe we should take a chance here
Oh what joy to hear him answer.
He has heard us, he is near
And his flute is pure and clear
Could this be the end of worry?
Better hurry better hurry
Ha! Seems like you both are caught!
Bring me manacles and fetters - you have lost out to your betters
Now I'll teach you to deceive me.
You will smart forth is, believe me
Hurry upw ith chains and rope
-Shall we really give up hope?
- Hurry up with chains and rope
Faint hearts never won a single thing
Little bells, let's hear you ring.
We must really take a chance
Let us risk a song and dance
How sweet is their tinkle, how tenderand gay
If only forever the music would play
Sweetly chiming bells, your worth is beyond all measure
Would that every man on earth owned so dear a treasure
Then to your harmonious sound love would flourish all around
It would mean the end of strife, fear and violations
Man would lead a peaceful life
Love would heal the nations
We praise thee, Sarastro.
Long live our master
What now will befall us?
What awful disaster?
My friend, this is the end, I fear
We soon shall have Sarastro here
Oh, if I were a mouse
I'd find a hole to hide in
Or if a snail, I'd glide into my little house
Oh dear
What ever shall we say?
Be honest and truthful
Honest, come wha tmay
Long life to Sarastro.
We praise his decisions
We hail our master, his heavenly visions
He wisely decides and we gladly obey he is our prophet, he shows us the way
Sir...
I confess, I disobeyed, escaped, because I was afraid
The blame,though, should not rest with me
The wicked Moor sought to abuse me and that is why I tried to flee
Arise, you have no need to fea rme
I do not ask for a confession a reason why you would depart
I know the secret of your heart yes,the secret of your heart
You acted under love's impression and yet I cannot set you free
You acted under love's impression and... and yet I cannot set you free
My mother grieves for losing me
Oh, my poor mother
She is within my power
Your life is wasted from the hour that you are left to her devices
She is my mother, that suffices
I love her
She is proud and weak
It is a manyou need to guide you
Advice from me you now must seek
With counsel fair I can provide you
My proud youngster, come this way, our lord Sarastroto obey
-'Tis he
-'Tis she
Yes, it is he
Oh, can it be
My arms must reach out to you and if I die for what I do...
-This is peculiar
- Have you no shame at all?
This is indecent, let go at once!
See your servant kneel before you
Formy reward I now implore you to punish the audacious lad
You must know the plans he had?
To snatch her was his foul intention until I made my intervention
- I beg you, hear me now, o Lord
-Yes,you deserve a just reward
- Fo rthis good man I will allow
-Accep my gratitude, o Lord
Forty lashes now
Oh no
Spare me your thanks,
'tis but my task
Long life to Sarastro.
We praise his decisions
We hail ourmaster his heavenly visions
Now for probation lead these two into the Temple to be tried
And let their eyes beveiled from sight until their hearts are purified
Where virtue and benevolence are given such preeminence this heavenly affinity yes, heavenly affinity does grantto man divinity
ACT Il
Friends and brothers
I solemnly declare this assembly to be of the utmost importance
Tamino is waiting bythe north gate
He intensely desires to find a goal and purpose in life and aspires to become a member of our brotherhood
- Is he virtuous?
- He is
- Is he fearless?
- He is
Is he reticent?
You deem him worthy, do you not?
Yes
For Tamino, I have destined mydaughter Pamina
Therefore I took her away from her mother,the arrogant creature
She would have our
Temple reduced to ashes and destroy the holy writ o fwisdom!
Her ultimate purpose is to control the world.
Pamina and Tamino shall protect our holy principles
You want them to rule together over our alliance and our kingdom?
In true love you shall find the origin of wisdom
That is why I shall resign my power to Pamina and Tamino if they show themselves worthy and endure their appointed trials
Brothers, doyou approve of my decision?
Yes
Ye gods oflight for your assistance to this young pair we now appeal
Lend them your wisdom and persistence
Thus guidet hem through their harsh ordeal
For their pains richly requite them
(Guide) Watch your step.
Watch your step, please.
Hispanic Tours, this way, please.
Follow my hand.
- No, no, no.
- The usual postcards! (Laughs)
- Photos, photos.
- No, thanks. I'll take my own.
Follow me.
This way. This way, please!
All right.
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
Keeping close, please.
Come along, move in close, please.
Here we have, ladies and gentlemen, a unique example of Medieval Christian art.
This representation of the devil carrying off the dead, goes far beyond the formalized art of its day.
Look closely.
The face of Satan expresses a quality, which reflects the very soul of pleasure in evil.
The devil seems a presence so strong and overpowering, that this painting has led to a local superstition.
The people of this region believe that it is only the power of the devil himself, which has kept this fresco from ruin.
- Listen, I'll be right back, OK?
- Lisa, where are you going?
- Wait for me there, all right?
- Yeah, well, hurry back.
(Guide) ...balanced between the figures of the living and of the dead.
(Man) Hm, the eyes, Maestro.
(Shopkeeper) Sí, señor?
(Man) I would add a few wrinkles and age them a bit more, hm?
- His attire, Maestro.
- Hm?
A bit severe, isn't it?
Well, I think this black here would be better, you know, because then you could use it on all occasions - for funerals, weddings, whenever you like.
- Hm, you have a point.
- Oh, I'll trim the mustache a little.
(clears throat) Excuse me, but how much are you asking for this?
It's not for sale.
It belongs to the gentleman here.
Oh.
(Man) Do you think black is too severe, Miss?
(Man) Strange, how strange.
You'd think the girl had seen the devil!
Excuse me, sir, could you tell me...
No, wait!
Sir, the main square...
Señora!
Excuse me, señora, but I'm Lost.
Can you tell me where the main square is? brain and mouth agape.
You're a dummy, is what you are.
Ah, is she the Lady we met in the shop?
- Hello, Miss.
- Excuse me, I... I... I'm Lost.
Can you... Can you tell me where the main square is?
- (Gasps)
- Come back here! (Chuckles)
Excuse me.
The square, what square?
Well, the one...
Well, the one where the painting is, the, er, fresco of the devil carrying away the dead.
Ah!
That way.
Good day, Miss.
Good day.
Darling!
- Elena.
- (Whimpers softy)
Why do you Look at me like that?
- No...
- You knew that I'd come back to you,
- that someday we'd find each other again.
- No, don't...
You must have known that I would have come back.
- No! No!
- No, Elena!
- Let me go! No!
- (Screams)
Help!
He... help!
Hey!
(Man) What is it now?
(Driver) I don't know, sir.
(Man) You're a chauffeur...
(Driver) Yes, sir.
I'm not a mechanical engineer.
(Woman) Must you use that tone?
(Man) please!
- please, open! please!
- (Man) What's the matter?
Excuse me, but I'm a tourist, and I've Lost my way.
(Man) All right...
- (Man) George!
- Yes?
(Man) We'll give this young Lady a lift.
(George) We will if we can get started.
(Man) May I know what's wrong with the car?
It's the upper hose. It's Losing water, sir.
It should be repaired.
Let's go on.
(Man) Why are you slowing down?
(George) It's not me, it's the car, sir.
(Man) Listen, George, do you have to stop right here in the middle of nowhere?
It's not up to me, sir.
If it's boiling over, we can't go much further, not without burning out the motor.
(Woman) You and your foreign cars.
What do we do now? Wait for parts to come in from the factory?
(Man) Stop that, will you?
How do you open these?
George?
- (George) Madam.
- Next time, listen to me.
(Woman) Thank you, George.
(George) Madam.
(Woman) How Long will it take?
(George) If we had a hose, a few minutes.
(Woman) Can't you fix it?
(George) I could try.
(Woman) please, George.
(Man) Oh, er, good evening. I, er...
I'm very sorry to bother you but we've had some trouble with the car.
The water hose is Leaking and we'll need a mechanic.
(Woman) Leandro!
(Man) I reallse it's Late, but if we could use your phone and get in touch with a garage...
(Woman) Leandro!
I'm sorry, there is no telephone here.
We have so little use for it, you see.
- (Woman) Send them away!
- Yes, my Lady, certainty!
(Man) Is there a hotel nearby?
No, not in the immediate vicinity.
Oh, there are a few roadside inns, but their accommodations would hardy meet with your approval.
(Man) I see.
(Leandro) Coming, my Lady!
(Woman) Oh, this is awful.
(Man) Yes, it's a dreadful night.
Please stay.
Don't go away.
(Man) Where could we find one of these roadside inns?
No, no, no, please, don't go away.
My mother's not used to visitors.
We live atone.
But please, please come in.
(Woman) Maximilian, what's keeping you?
Excuse me, I'll... only be a moment.
Mother.
Tell them to go,
Maximilian, dear, listen to me.
W... we're always so atone.
It'll only be for one night.
Mother, please.
She...
They've no place to go.
Only for one night.
- Very well, if you wish.
- Oh, thank you, Mother.
Max... not in here.
Show them to the cottage.
It's just ahead.
A few more strides...
- Thank goodness for that!
- Sophia!
Well, we could at Least tell George where we're going.
Would you care for a Lollipop?
You know, the villa’s a bit run-down, but I'm sure the cottage will be suitable.
Besides, even the Countess would prefer it. Miss...
- Erm, you and I earller this evening, yes?
- I...
I mean, you were lost and asked for directions.
- You do remember, don't you?
- No.
I do most of the shopping for the Countess and I'm often in town.
And very llttle escapes me, if you know what I mean.
(Woman) Well, are we supposed to stand here all night?
- (Man) Listen there, where is this place?
- Excuse me.
Come, please. Come this way.
(Woman) Oh, it's so sllppery.
(Leandro) There's a bit of moss here... and there... and everywhere. (Laughs)
(Woman) What's the matter with him?
(Leandro) Come, Miss!
This way.
Here we go.
Straight on.
That's it. Excellent!
Excellent!
- (Gasps)
- (Clock chimes)
- Now, where's your husband?
- Guess!
Oh!
Taking his bath.
The first thing he did was to go look for a tub. (Chuckles)
No need to worry.
He knows about us.
He's not bllnd.
It's just that he doesn't care.
Don't look llke that.
Hm?
(Man whispers) I love you.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
What frightened you so?
That's only Leandro.
(Leandro) Messy... dummy!
(Woman) No, no, no, it...
(Woman) It wasn't Leandro, it was...
(Maximllian) Oh, he was carrying a dummy.
- Oh, it was awful!
- The vllla's full of them. They're harmless.
Don't cry.
Don't!
This is such a gloomy house.
We're so alone.
You can't imagine how... how happy I am now that you're back.
Back?
This is the last rose of the season.
It llngered on and waited for you.
If only you would stay!
Don't go away.
(Woman) I... I don't even know you.
(Maximllian) Everything's so different with you here.
I feel allve and happy.
(Woman) But...
(Maximllian) Don't say no. please!
(Woman) Maximllian!
Is that you there?
Yes, Mother!
Excuse me, I have to go now.
I'll see you at dinner.
Good evening,
Mr Rabbit, or is it Mr Hare?
Would you care for a radish? No?
They're very good. (Hums)
(Max) I'm very pleased you decided to accept our invitation. Thank you.
(Sophia) Thank you.
(Man) Yes, thank you.
(Man) Our intrusion wasn't very timely.
(Max) Oh, no, no, no.
You're most welcome.
Our mother's not used to visitors.
She was a bit frightened, that's all.
It was all so unexpected.
You understand.
- Yes, of course.
- (Max) So thrllllng.
(Sophia) Thrllllng?
(Max) You must be tired.
Was it a long trip?
That depends on the starting point,
I wouldn't know how to answer that.
- (Max) Oh?
- I never plan things that far ahead.
I certainly envy you.
A new horizon emerges for you each day.
My world, instead, is the very configuration of this vllla. I...
(Max) Mother! Oh, excuse me.
I'm so glad you came down.
Thank you, Mother.
Good evening.
Leandro, I would llke to be introduced to our guests.
I'm Francis Lehar.
My wife Sophia and I wish to thank you for your kind assistance.
(Leandro) That wlll suffice, thank you.
Your Ladyship, may I present Mr and Mrs Francis Lehar.
And may I also present Miss, er...
Miss, er...
Lisa. Lisa Reiner.
Miss Lisa Reiner.
- please be seated.
- Thank you, Your Ladyship.
Our guest Mr Lehar was telling us just before you arrived, Mother, of his journeys. He has the world in the palm of his hand, it would seem.
- (Francis chuckles)
- Where's the other person?
Other person?
You must mean the chauffeur.
- He's outside.
- No, not the chauffeur, dear.
I mean the fifth person who came here this evening.
Mother, belleve me...
Maximllian, dear, you haven't forgotten him, have you?
It's so easy to imagine a mysterious visitor in this house.
Yes, thank you.
- Rare! Very rare!
- Mm-hmm!
The entire setting is so right for a tall tale of gloom and perdition.
We could make one up as we go along.
We have the right ingredients.
The dark night.
This house.
It's all so... so spooky.
Don't you find, Your Ladyship?
I prefer ghosts to vampires, though.
They're so much more human.
They have a tradition to llve up to.
Somehow they manage to keep all the horror in without spllllng any blood.
(Max) Mother, please!
Mother, llsten to me, please.
You're tired.
(Woman) What's wrong, Maximllian?
(Max) Nothing. Don't worry.
- I told you he'd be back.
- Mother...
I...
I was not introduced to the fifth guest, Maximllian.
- (Smashing)
- (Sophia gasps) please! Excuse me, but I...
I'll only be a moment.
Do continue, please.
I have to...
Leandro, the cake.
- It's with chocolate sprinkles.
- Thank you.
Leandro, perhaps our guests would llke some cake also. It's quite good.
Please continue.
I... I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
I brought you some cake.
It's your favourite.
With chocolate sprinkles.
Did you know he was back?
You mustn't see him.
You must send him away.
I wlll not let him come between us again.
He's caused enough anguish.
He'll never enter this room!
You've nothing to say?
- You're not asleep.
- (Moaning)
You can pretend if you llke.
But you'll never leave this room!
Do you hear me?
Never! Never.
- That should do it.
- (Leandro) You'll be leaving at once?
Uh-huh.
(Leandro) Quite adept with these mechanical toys, aren't you?
So-so.
Thanks for the...
Oh!
You're over there.
Thanks for the tape.
Could you tell the others to get ready?
I'll be through here in a minute.
- Of course.
- Thanks.
That didn't take much, did it?
(George) No, just a lot of tape.
Most things aren't that easy to mend.
How could you come back?
After what you've done to us!
Mother...
Mother was certain that you'd return.
She was certain.
But I never thought you'd have the courage.
Why did you have to come back now?
Just when I found happiness.
I won't let you destroy everything.
You can't take her away again!
Where are you?
How can I stop you... when I can't even see you?
Where are you, you coward?
Show yourself!
Oh, finally!
This is so nerve-wracking.
Lisa, we're leaving as soon as the car is ready but we'd be glad to take you if...
Oh, erm... I don't think our young lady wlll be going with you.
Master Maximllian has asked her to stay.
Come.
Come closer, girl.
The eyes, Leandro.
What colour are the eyes?
Changeable, my lady.
But by candlellght... blue.
She's bllnd.
My God!
And the hair, Leandro?
Tell me of it.
Tell me of the hair.
Light, my lady, and gently flowing.
Golden llke a field of wheat?
No, my lady, brighter stlll.
And haloing an equally beautiful countenance.
Oh, she's a very lovely creature, my lady.
You wouldn't llsten when I told you to stay away.
Now it's too late.
Frank, this is ridiculous.
I'm going out of my mind, Frank.
These people are all crazy.
What's happened to George?
What's going on?
Where's George gone, dear?
To fix the car!
Calm down, wlll you?
Calm down!
All right. I'll go out and take a look.
And you calm down!
Oh, it's about time!
Hm?
I find that invariably, Miss Lisa... there's a very simple explanation for almost everything.
Don't you agree?
It's cold...
- ...you're trembllng, darllng.
- Oh, Carlos.
When I saw you, I...
I had to come back and help you in some way.
To give you llfe and happiness.
Oh, Carlos, my love!
I love you, Carlos!
Carlos, I love you.
Carlos, oh...
Don't leave me, please.
The thought of losing you fllls me with such sadness.
I don't dare think of it.
Oh, my love, you're back!
I've waited so long for you.
No!
George?
George!
Where are you?
George?
George!
Oh, where did he go?
George!
- (Francis) What's the matter?
- Oh, Geor...
- Where have you been? Did you find him?
- Obviously not.
Your concern for our chauffeur is almost touching.
Where are you going?
If this is your way of being a man,
Frank...
- ...I'm very unimpressed.
- You slut.
Let go of me!
Why?
Oh...
We must go to notify the pollce.
No, we don't want anyone coming now.
It's all so horrible.
To think Mother predicted it...
We mustn't call them.
They'll pry into our llves, and...
And I'll be gullty.
It's not always wise to stir up the past.
We all have some unforgivable secret.
Sarah, let us leave well enough alone.
Careful!
Your mother imagined there being someone else in the house.
If we haven't seen them, there must be a reason, don't you think?
If you would take my humble advice,
Mr Lehar, it wlll be best to leave at once.
Oh, yes. I understand.
Would you say my chauffeur discovered something he wasn't supposed to?
Who knows?
We all have enemies, Mr Lehar.
And what better place to get rid of someone undesirable?
Undesirable?
Why?
- What enemies are there in here?
- Hm.
But not to worry.
All you have to do is go and leave the corpse to us.
Now, Mr Lehar, can I trouble you for a cigarette?
- Oh, yes.
- Hm.
- Leandro!
- (Leandro coughs)
Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting out those cigarettes?
The smoke bothers the Contessa.
- You called, my lady?
- Where is my son?
Is he with the girl?
I don't know.
Get rid of her.
We must send her away.
Oh, Lisa.
What good is it to hope for the future when solltude is all that awaits you?
What else is there to llve for?
What else matters after having felt the joy of your presence?
- When I...
- Hm?
When I think of my llfe and on what poor stuff my dreams were fed!
I feel such futllity in growing old.
If you were to leave me, I'd...
No. No, it is I who shall never leave you.
Oh, Maximllian.
What evll spirit forces you to utter such words?
- Have you no pride?
- No.
I have no pride when it comes to words, what things I do.
I only have the greatest regrets for what I have not done.
Mother, please.
Try to understand.
If you knew how desperate I feel...
We both know how it wlll end, Maximllian.
No, you're wrong.
You're wrong this time, Mother.
(Contessa) No, my son.
(Max) It wlll be different.
You can't stop me, Mother.
(Contessa) Oh, my poor chlld!
(Max) I'm no longer a chlld.
Let me llve my llfe.
Come, Maximllian, come...
No, don't shout.
Be quiet! Don't make a sound!
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet, my love!
You must belleve me.
I want to help you.
For years I've waited for this moment, trust me.
We must flee from here.
Wait for me here.
I'll go and see what he's doing.
Wait for me, my love.
♪ Should old acquaintance be... ♪
♪ Say it with flowers... ♪
Hm.
- Sorry.
- (Bones crunch)
Elena, what's the matter?
- I heard you scream.
- (Screams)
No, wait. I want to help you!
Come back!
Elena!
No, wait!
- Elena.
- (Screams)
Why did you run away from me?
I told you I want to help you.
I love you.
If you're through mourning your lover we can leave.
Let's go!
Come on!
Go on, get in!
Frank, I'm not coming with you.
- I'm staying here untll George is buried.
- Get in the car.
We can do without the chauffeur.
Don't be afraid, my love.
Elena!
We've suffered so much, but it's over now, my love.
I've come for you.
It's all ending.
Elena!
(Screams) No! Help!
Help!
HELP!
No! No!
Hurry, Leandro!
Yes, my lady.
The ceremony's about to begin.
The ceremony's about to begin.
The ceremony's always about to begin.
Oh, hurry, Leandro. (Chuckles)
That's easier said than done.
Excuse me.
Look at that head.
Newly moulded this morning and already it's spllt!
Must be that synthetic glue.
Mm, that's what it is.
Hm.
Neither glue nor spllntered heads can stop the funeral.
The ceremony must go on.
The Countess is waiting.
Waiting... to bury the dead.
The poor Countess isn't so wrong, really.
Wanting to get rid of him.
He's not... a very pleasant memory.
A man...
Iosing his head.
(Laughs) That's pretty good.
A man losing his head.
Hm.
A husband.
A husband losing his head... over a woman?
Shame on you. But stlll, the Countess wants his body repaired.
She wants it put in working order for the burial.
Tradition, she says.
More work, I say!
All this tradition.
I wouldn't mind if I had any.
But what does tradition mean to a poor devll llke me?
Work and fatigue, that's my inheritance.
They break, they snap, they pop, they crackle, and I'm the one who puts their tradition back together again.
Hm!
And now I've got another puppet to make.
Lucky for me, you look just llke her.
Because... you won't be around tomorrow, that's for sure.
I knew you'd be back.
Everything's been ready.
We were only waiting.
But you didn't come back here for me, your wife.
You came back for her.
You saw her.
She was in that body.
And you came back for her.
(Leandro) Gently.
Ever so gently.
Ah!
Oh, blast!
The irresponsibllity.
Such devllish acts.
Hm.
Hmm.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Is this the face that launched so many deaths?
A modern-day Helen?
Cleopatra?
Sleeping Beauty?
And I'm Prince Charming.
Oop!
Didn't work.
- (Lisa groans softly)
- Hm.
Sleeping Beauty awakens.
How do you feel?
Did you sleep well?
- It isn't...
- That's good. (Hums)
But... but it... isn't possible.
Oh, be careful. please don't touch.
The glue is stlll wet.
- Size... six and a half.
- But he can't be! He spoke to me!
Hm? Well, that's no reason to faint dead away.
It's quite possible that he spoke to you.
I mean, this is Señor Carlos.
That's the Countess's husband.
Maximllian's step-father.
I mean, why shouldn't you have seen him?
He was here. (Chuckles)
No, don't you see? It can't be.
I... I know he's dead.
I saw him in his casket in the chapel!
In the chapel?
No, no, no, no.
You saw this dummy in the coffin.
You see, it's a dress rehearsal for the funeral ceremony.
Oh, by the way, I dropped it and it broke on the way here, but please don't tell the Countess.
I mean, I fixed it.
You can hardly tell, can you?
Hm?
Then Carlos is... is allve.
Isn't he?
Oh, no.
Señor Carlos... is dead.
Hm.
Max! Max!
Leandro. Leandro!
- Yes, my lady?
- I heard her running, calling for my son.
Hurry, Leandro, there is no time to lose.
Tell me, does she really look...
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, my lady.
She is Miss Elena in person.
- We must find her.
- Yes, my lady.
Maximllian!
Your mother is after me.
We'll go away... the two of us.
I'll help you escape.
We'll start a new llfe together.
My mother is jealous beyond reason.
I don't want to spend the rest of my llfe in this nightmare.
No. No.
Help me.
Please, help me to leave.
(Contessa) That room.
Find her, Leandro! You must find her.
(Max) Shh! Quiet, don't move.
Are you searching, Leandro?
Answer me.
We must find her before Maximllian does.
(Contessa) Leandro!
You're so beautiful.
I didn't think there could ever be a girl as beautiful as you.
You're even more beautiful than Elena.
Elena?
Come.
- Come.
- Where are we...?
No, I don't want to think about her now.
She brings back so many sad memories.
I loved her deeply, yet she deceived me.
- Come, I'll show her to you.
- Maximllian, I...
- Don't worry.
- I...
Come, it's all right.
Come, my love.
This is Elena.
- (Lisa whimpers)
- No, don't, Lisa!
No, Lisa. No, my love, you mustn't do that. please!
I told you, she means nothing to me now.
Belleve me, my love.
She means nothing.
I love you. only you.
Belleve me.
She could have helped me.
I begged her to.
- But she wouldn't.
- (Lisa sobs)
She wouldn't do it.
It's true, she wouldn't.
She wouldn't.
- Here.
- (Muffled screams)
Forgive me, my love.
My only love.
Now, we'll always be together.
You and I.
Always.
It wlll be different with you.
I know it wlll.
It has to be different.
It has to be.
- Leave me.
- (Woman laughs)
- Leave!
- (Woman laughs)
- I can't with you here!
- (Woman laughs)
- Why don't you leave me?
- (Woman laughs)
- Why?
- (Woman's laughter fades)
I hate this smell of death!
We don't want funeral trimmings!
This is a wedding ceremony!
Do you understand?
A wedding ceremony!
What wlll that change?
It's all my fault.
- I should have stopped you.
- No!
- I should never have let you meet her.
- Quiet.
After what you did to Elena.
After what I did to Elena?
- Maximllian, please.
- And what about what she did to me?
- She ran away with your husband.
- Maximllian, I forbid you to talk that...
Your husband!
Yet Carlos never knew why she didn't join him.
I avenged myself and you at the same time.
No, it's not as simple as you think,
Maximllian.
Now they'll come looking for all those people.
Why did you do it, my chlld?
Why?
- They were going to take my Lisa away.
- That would've been better for all of us.
That stupid driver.
I had to stop them!
That girl wlll be the end of us.
You must get rid of her.
No. No!
If we cover every trace of what happened here, there'll stlll be a chance.
Otherwise they'll take you away, and you wlll be punished, my love.
I can't go on llke this!
I can't llve llke this in your shrine of death!
- It's all around me!
- Maximllian.
I want to llve.
I want to be free.
I want to be with people!
- I understand, poor chlld.
- Don't call me that!
I'm your mother.
No-one can understand you as I do, or protect you as I do.
Listen to me.
You wlll be saved only if Lisa disappears.
- Lisa.
- Listen to me, my chlld.
Lisa.
Go.
- Get out.
- Don't talk that way to your mother.
You are very cruel with me today, but I forgive you.
I know you don't mean what you say.
Do you, my darllng?
Say that you love me.
Leandro!
Leandro!
Where are you?
Leandro!
Answer me!
Leandro!
(Gasps) No...
No!
Mother!
No, please, no!
No.
No!
Mother, please! I... I...
No.
No!
They just never stay put.
Oh, it sllpped.
(Max) Lisa!
Lisa!
You shall never leave me.
We'll always be together.
Don't go...
Don't go!
(Chlldren chanting) One... two...
Hey, come back!
She's a ghost.
Everyone knows that.
No one's llved there for a hundred years.
- She's a ghost.
- A ghost!
- Let's run!
- Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Hm...
Here you are, Mr Leandro.
It's the best I could do.
I had such a short notice.
I do hope you think it's all right, sir.
Oh?
I'm afraid it's all too late, my friend.
All too late.
The airport, right away, please.

'and keep your seats in an upright position.
'Kindly refrain from smoking.
'Thank you.'

'We're flying at an altitude of

BOYS: Merry Christmas.
- Get away from me, you scavengers.
Blimey. Who's he?
That's Father Christmas.
A plague on Father Christmas.
And he sends his best to you too, guv'nor.
[BOYS LAUGHING]
BOY 4: Regards, Father Christmas.
- Humbug.
Insolent young ruffians.
Coming here with their Christmas nonsense.
Beware, Cratchit.
You have a dangerous sense of humor.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hell fire and damnation.
Don't they know that I'm trying to run a business here?
Uncle Ebenezer,
I cannot tell you what a joy it is to see your happy, smiling face.
- Hmm, it's you.
- A Merry Christmas, Uncle Ebenezer.
God save you.
God save me from Christmas.
It's a lot of humbug.
Christmas a humbug? Come now,
I'm sure you don't mean that.
And I'm sure that I do mean that.
Merry Christmas indeed.
What reason have you got to be merry? You're poor enough.
What reason have you got to be miserable? You're rich enough.
There is no such thing as rich enough.
Only poor enough.
Don't be so dismal, Uncle Ebenezer.
What else can I be when I live in a world full of fools babbling Merry Christmas at one another?
What's Christmas but a time for finding yourself a year older and not a day richer?
There's nothing merry in that.
If I could work my will, nephew, every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
Oh, God forbid, uncle.
You keep Christmas in your way and let me keep it in mine.
But you don't keep it.
Then let me... Get off my ledger.
You'll ruin my binding.
Then let me leave it alone, sir.
And be good enough to leave me alone during business hours.
Seven o'clock on Christmas eve?
That's not business hours.
That's drudgery for the sake of it.
And an insult to all men of good will.
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you, Bob Cratchit.
Another word from you, Cratchit, and you will celebrate Christmas by losing your position.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge.
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
I wonder you don't go into politics.
You're fool enough.
[CHUCKLES]
Come now.
Don't be angry.
Dine with me wife and me tomorrow.
As though you hadn't got enough problems, you went and got yourself married.
Now why in God's name did you ever do that?
Because I fell in love with the lady.
If there's one thing in the world more nauseating than a Merry Christmas, it's the hypocrisy of a happy marriage with some idiot lovesick female.
Good afternoon, sir.
My offer stands.
You are always welcome, uncle.
Just like Christmas itself.
I said good afternoon.
Merry Christmas, uncle.
You too, Bob Cratchit. And your family.
Thank you, sir.
And to your good lady.
Oh, and uncle, happy New Year.
Good afternoon.
[CLOCK CHIMING]
Excuse me, sir.
But, well, it's 7:00, sir.
Correct, Cratchit.
Well, I don't wish to be impertinent,
Mr. Scrooge, but, uh, would it be too much trouble for me to have my, uh, wages, sir?
The trouble with you, Cratchit, is that all you think of is pleasure.
Pleasure and squandering money.
You'll, uh...
You'll be wanting the whole day off tomorrow, I suppose.
- If it's convenient, sir.
- No, sir.
It is not convenient.
And it is not fair.
Yet if I stopped your wages for it, you'd think yourself ill-used no doubt.
And yet you don't think me ill used when I pay a day's wages for no work.
Well, it is Christmas day,
Mr. Scrooge.
And it is only once a year, sir.
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December.
I don't pay good money for you to be forever on holiday.
I appreciate your kindness,
Mr. Scrooge.
That's my weakness.
I'm a martyr to my own generosity.
I give you one Christmas day off and you expect them all.
Very well, take the day.
Thank you, sir.
But be here all the earlier the next morning.
Yes, sir. I will, sir.
Thank you very much.
Oh, and, uh, Merry Christmas,
Mr. Scrooge.
Be gone from here and take your infernal Merry Christmas with you.
I beg your pardon, sir.
No offense, sir.
There's another one.
Fifteen shillings a week.
A wife and five children.
Still talks of a Merry Christmas.
[MERCHANT SHOUTING
AND CROWD MURMURING]
Boo. Kathy, my dear.
Tim. Oh.
Oh, you're both frozen.
I'm sorry I'm late.
But Mr. Scrooge and I had a lot of last-minute business to attend to.
Well, my loves, which one do you like best, eh?
I like that dolly in the corner.
I like all of them.
Ha, ha. Good boy.
And why not one in particular?
Well, you said
I can't have none of them, so I might as well like them all.
Tim, you are a philosopher and a gentleman.
And I've got 15 shillings in my pocket.
BOTH:
Fifteen shillings?
Fifteen shillings.
Which says that the Cratchit family are gonna have as good a Christmas as the lord mayor of London himself.
Oh, I do like that dolly in the corner.

Tied with pretty bows

What delights they hide
But 'til Christmas morning

You with five children, Bob.
Five for a shilling.
Thank you, John.

Won't it be exciting if it snows?
I suppose that children everywhere

[MERCHANT SHOUTING

Quite right, Mr. Cratchit.
With your lot to feed, apples at six a penny are the best bet.
I'd rather have the dolly in the corner.
I'd rather have the oranges.
And 1846 is the best vintage in 20 years.
At that price it should be.
- Your change, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Bissett.
- And a happy Christmas to you.
BISSETT: Happy Christmas to you, sir.
This will make the finest quality punch,
Mr. C.
And only tuppence a pint.
Christmas punch, it's a Cratchit specialty.
[KIDS LAUGH]

Four pence for a Christmas pudding.
Scandalous.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
JOHN: It's Papa.
- Where is he?
Here we are, my loves.
Look what we've brought for you.
And about time too, Bob Cratchit.
We were beginning to think you'd all gone away for Christmas.
[SINGING] Christmas children
Hunger for Christmas morning
Thank you.
Christmas day's a wonder to behold
Young ones' dreams come true
Not so young ones too
I believe that story we've been told
You're not the only ones who have been busy.
Come and see what we've been up to.
Christmas is for children
Young and old
MAN 1: Uh, good evening.
MAN 2: Good evening, sir.
Have we the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?
It's no pleasure to me, sir, to be addressed by either of you.
And Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years.
Seven years ago this very night he died.
We've no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner.
[MAN 1 CHUCKLES]
Uh, Mr. Scrooge.
Uh, sir, at this festive season of the year, sir, it is more than usually desirable, uh, that we should make some slight provision for the poor and the destitute.
Excellent. Then I suggest you do so.
You miss our point, sir.
The poor suffer greatly at the present time.
Many thousands are in want of common necessaries.
- Are there no prisons?
- Oh, indeed there are, sir.
That's something there's no shortage of.
And the workhouses, are they still in operation?
They are, sir.
I wish I could say they were not.
I'm very glad to hear it.
For a moment I was afraid that something had occurred to stop them in their useful purpose.
MAN 1:
Oh, but, sir.
A few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth.
We choose this time, sir, because it is a time when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices.
- What may we put you down for, sir?
- Nothing, sir.
MAN 1:
Ah, you wish to be anonymous.
I wish to be left alone, sir.
That is what I wish.
I don't make myself merry at Christmas and I cannot afford to make idle people merry.
I have been forced to support the establishments I have mentioned through taxation.
And God knows they cost more than they are worth.
Those who are badly off must go there.
Many would rather die than go there.
If they would rather die then they had better do it and decrease the surplus population.
Good night, gentlemen.
Humbug.
Poppycock. Balderdash. Bah.

Scavengers and sycophants

Reaping rich rewards
Contaminating everything they see
Corrupting honest men

I hate people
People are despicable creatures.
Loathsome, inexplicable creatures
Good for nothing, kickable creatures
I hate people
I abhor them

I hate people
I detest them
I deplore them

MERCHANT 1:
Knives, scissors or razors to grind.
Two pounds, 5 shillings, ladies.
Due before Christmas.
That means today.
But you see, Mr. Scrooge, sir, we've been giving more credit than usual.
That's your business, madam.
Mine is to collect
2 pounds, 5 shillings now.
We sell things for children, sir.
At this time of the year people can't afford to pay.
Neither can I afford it, madam.
However, I will allow you an extra week's credit.
BOTH:
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.
Which will only cost you a further 12 shillings.
Twelve. Oh, but, Mr. Scrooge.
But we scarcely make that much in a week.
If you would prefer me to confiscate your store and its contents, which is my legal right, I will do so.
- But we will pay, sir.
- We will pay, sir.
You'll both sign this.
MERCHANT 1:
Knives, scissors or razors to grind.
- And you can give me a pair of these.
WOMAN 1: Certainly, Mr. Scrooge.
Oh, look, there's that lovable
Father Christmas again.

A penny for the baby, sir.

I hate people
I loathe people
I despise and abominate people
Move over.

Little wonder
I hate people
And I don't care if they hate me

- But I'm performing.
- You're always performing.
- Where's my money?
- Tomorrow for sure, Mr. Scrooge.
After the Christmas morning show.
It's my best day of the year.
Tomorrow it will be 2 pounds 10 or I confiscate your puppets.
All right, Mr. Scrooge.
Two pounds 10.

Oh, what a pity. What a pity.

One week.
- Ten days?
- One week.

- And put a lid on that stuff.
I'll take it home.

What do you want with me?
MARLEY:

Who are you?
In life, I was your partner,
Jacob Marley.
Can you sit down?
Of course I can sit down.
SCROOGE:
Do so then.
[SCROOGE SCOFFS]
You don't believe in me, do you?
No, I don't.
Why do you doubt the evidence of your own eyes?
Because I've had a slight stomach disorder.
It's undoubtedly affected my vision.
You're an hallucination.
Probably brought on by an undigested bit of beef or a blob of mustard, or a crumb of cheese or an old potato.
Yes, that's what you are.
You are an old potato.
You do not exist, Jacob Marley.
It's humbug I tell you.
It's a lot of...
[WAILS]
No! I beseech you!
Stop!
Now do you believe in me?
I believe in you absolutely.
But why do you walk the earth?
Why do you come to persecute me?
And what is that great chain you wear?
I wear the chain I forged in life.
I made it link by link and yard by yard while on Earth.
And now I'll never be rid of it any more than you will ever be rid of yours.
Mine?
It was as heavy and long as this seven Christmases ago.
It's a terrible ponderous chain you are making, Scrooge.
Tell me more, Marley, but speak comfort to me.
- I have none to give.
- None?
Comfort comes from other sources,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
And is given by other ministers than I to other kinds of men than you.
When I lived, my spirit, like yours, never walked beyond the narrow limits of our counting house.
But you were always a good man of business.
Mankind should be our business,
Ebenezer.
But we seldom attend to it, as you shall see.
Marley!
[SCROOGE WHIMPERING]
Marley. Marley.
[SINGING] See the phantoms
Filling the sky around you
They astound you I can tell
These inhabitants of hell
Poor wretches
Whom the hand of heaven ignores
Beware
Beware
Beware
Lest their dreadful fate be yours
It was a dream.
[CHUCKLES]
Yes, that's what it was. A dream.
It's not a dream, Ebenezer.
For pity's sake, Marley.
Leave me in peace.
It was for pity's sake I came here.
Pity for you.
I leave you with just the tiniest chance of escaping my fate.
You were always a good friend to me, Jacob. Thank you.
You will be visited by three ghosts.
I... I think I'd rather not.
The first will appear tonight when the bell tolls 1.
Couldn't I take them all at once, and get it over with, Jacob?
The second at 2:00.
And the third when the bell tolls 3.
- I must go now.
- Marley, wait.
I'm doomed to wander through the world in everlasting repentance.
Remember what has passed between us.
Farewell, Scrooge.
Three ghosts? Ha.
Three humbugs.

May I enquire more precisely who or what you are?
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
- Long past?
- No, your past.
- What business brings you here?
- Your welfare.
To be woken by a ghost at 1:00 in the morning is hardly conducive to my welfare.
Your redemption, then.
Rise and walk with me.
Where are we going?
We are going to look at your childhood.

All the joy and beauty

Fran!
Why doesn't she wave back?
She cannot see you.
These are but shadows of the things that have been.

The school is not quite empty, is it?
A solitary boy neglected by his family is left there still.
Poor boy.

What is it you wish?
There were some boys singing a Christmas carol outside my door last night.
I should have given them something, that's all.
Let us look at another Christmas.
Ebby. Dear, dear brother.
- I've come to bring you home.
- Home with you, Fran?
Father is so much kinder than he used to be.
He sent me in a coach to bring you home, Ebby.
We're to be together all Christmas long.
Go and fetch your things.

Hi-de-hi, it's Christmas Eve, Dick.
It's Christmas, Ebenezer.

Happiness is whatever
You want it to be
Happiness is a high hill
Will I find it? Yes, I will
Happiness is a tall tree
Can I climb it?
Watch and see
They say happiness
Is the folly of fools
Pity poor me, one of the fools
Happiness is smiling upon me
Walking my way, sharing my day
Happiness is whatever
You want it to be
Happiness is a bright star
Are we happy? Yes, we are
Happiness is a clear sky
Give me wings and let me fly
Let me fly
[HORSE NEIGHS]
For happiness
Is whatever you want it to be
SCROOGE [SINGING]:
You, you were good for me
You were my day
Did all you could for me
I let you go away
I did love her, you know.
- Did you?
- Oh, yes, I loved her.
Then why did you let her go?
I've never been quite sure.
Then let us go and see.
- Ebenezer?
- Yeah?
I've come to say goodbye.
I am going away, Ebenezer.
You will not see me again.
But you were gonna marry me.
No.
You have found another love to replace me.
She's much more desirable than I am.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
This lady here.
How shall I ever understand this world?
There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and yet, there is nothing it condemns with such severity as the pursuit of wealth.
You fear the world too much,
Ebenezer.
All your nobler dreams that I loved
I've seen die off one by one until only the desire for gain is left.
I'm not changed towards you, am I?
Yes, you are.
Your promise to me was made when you were poor and content to be so.
- You were someone else then.
- I was a boy.
You see?
Your own feelings tell you that you are not what you were.
I see that all too clearly.
And so I can release you.
Have I ever asked to be released?
In words, no.
But in a changed nature, yes.
In everything that made my love of value to you, yes.
If you met me today, you would not love me.
- I would, I do.
- Shh.
- I still do.
- I'm trying to listen.
Isabel, I find it impossible to discuss personal affairs during business hours.
Now, please.
ISABEL:
You see?
If you weigh me by gain,
I weigh very little.
And so I am not enough for you.
And I release you with a full heart for the love of him you once were.
Say something, you fool.
Say something.
You may, for a little while, have pain in this, but it will pass.
And you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke.
OLD SCROOGE:
Don't go, it's a mistake. Don't go.
Be happy in the life you have chosen.
OLD SCROOGE:
Isabel.
Isabel?
Isabel.
[DOOR CLOSES]
You fool.
[SINGING]
You fool
I let you go away
And now I can see
Now you're a dream gone by
Oh, how could there be
Such a fool as I?
I who must travel on
What hope for me?
Dream where my past has gone
Live with a memory
You, my only hope
You, my only love
You, you
You
Spirit, remove me from this place.
I can bear it no more.
[CLOCK TICKING]
[SOBBING]
Stupid old fool.
Getting yourself all upset over nothing.
It's all in your imagination.
[CLOCK CHIMING]
The first at 1, the second at 2.
I'm ready for you, wherever you are.
Nothing.
[LAUGHTER]
GHOST:
Ebenezer Scrooge.
Come here, Scrooge.
I'm waiting for you.
Or shall I come in there and get you?
I'm coming.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
GHOST:
Welcome, Scrooge.
Is it too bright for you?
Come over here, you weird little man.
I am the Spirit of Christmas Present.
Now look upon me.
You have never seen the like of me before.
Never.
Yet, how many of my brothers have you rejected in your miserable lifetime?
I have never met any of your brothers, sir.
You have never looked for them.
Well, how many of them are there?
What year is this?
Then I have 1, 859 brothers.
Each year at this time, one of us visits this puny little planet to spread some happiness, and to remove as many as we can of the causes of human misery.
Which is why I have come to see you,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
[SCROOGE YELLS]
You're a funny-looking little creature.
I must admit, I found it hard to believe you'd be as horrible as my brothers said you'd be.
But now that I look at you, I can see they were understating the truth.
Let me assure you that I am a man of the highest principles and the most generous spirit.
Generous spirit? You?
You don't know the meaning of the phrase.
But you're about to find out.
Now, drink this.
- What is it?
- Taste it.
SCROOGE:
Mm.
Mm.
Do you like it?
It's wonderful.
I've never tasted anything like it.
Of course you haven't.
- What is it?
- The milk of human kindness.
There are more good things in this life, Scrooge, than you can possibly imagine.
I'm sure there are.
Can I have some more?
[SINGING] Ebenezer Scrooge
The sins of man are huge
A never-ending symphony
Of villainy and infamy
Duplicity, deceit and subterfuge
And no one's worse
Than Ebenezer Scrooge
Though man's a handy candidate
For hell
I must admit, life sometimes
Has its brighter side as well
I like life, life likes me
Life and I fairly fully agree
Life is fine, life is good
Especially mine
Which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
Life's a pleasure that I deny not
I like life here and now
Life and I made a mutual vow
Till I die, life and I
We'll both try to be better somehow
And if life were a woman
She would be my wife
- Why?
- Why?
Because I like life
That's all very well for you, but not for me.
I hate life.
Nonsense, man. Why?
Because life hates me, that's why.
Scrooge, you're an even bigger fool than I took you for.
I've never heard such a lot of self-pitying drivel.
You don't even know how to live.
Now you listen to me.
I like life
Well, go on.
[SINGING]
I like life
That's better.
[SINGING]
Life likes me
Life likes me
Good, good.
I make life a perpetual spree
A perpetual spree
Eating food
Drinking wine
Thinking who'd like the privilege
To dine me
I like drinking the drink I'm drinking
That's better, Scrooge.
I like thinking the thoughts
I'm thinking
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music and I'm in a trance
- Tra-la-la
- Oom-pa-pa
Chances are we shall get up
And prance
[SCROOGE LAUGHS]
Where there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
- Why?
- Why?
Because I like life
[SCROOGE LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY]
BOTH [SINGING]:
Where there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
Why? Because I like life
See how much we like life
[GHOST GRUNTS]
[GHOST CHUCKLING
AND SCROOGE GRUNTING]
What happened? What's happened?
What the devil am I doing in a pile of snow in the middle of the night?
That's what I'd like to know.
Where are we?
Now, Scrooge, over there lies the lavish home of Robert Cratchit, esquire, who owes both the opulence of his surroundings and the magnificence of his Christmas celebrations to the high principles and generous spirit of his employer.
Here. I want to look in the window.
It will cost you nothing, which I'm sure will be good news for you.
Will they be able to see me?
No, which I feel sure will be good news for them.
I could do with another of them drinks.
Later.
For the time being, I think it better you see things as they really are.
Oh, nectar. Pure nectar.
And at only tuppence a pint, you can't really grumble.
What a tragedy it is that Her Majesty and His Worship the Lord Mayor couldn't be with us tonight.
They don't know what they're missing.
Now you try that, my love.
Mm. Bob Cratchit, you're a genius.
JOY:
The stuffing's ready, father.
The marriage of roast goose and sage and onion stuffing à la Cratchit is one of the culinary miracles of our day.
[MRS. CRATCHIT CHUCKLES]
And a living legend throughout the length and breadth of Camden Town.
Now, the only remaining problem, my dear, is whether to put the stuffing inside the goose or the goose inside the stuffing.
[KIDS LAUGH]
But since the ultimate intention is to put them both inside ourselves,
I don't suppose it very much matters.
And here they are, the one and only carol-singing Cratchits.
Newly returned from their triumphant musical tour.
How did you do, Tiny Tim?
- Ten pence ha'penny.
- Ooh. Well done.
Another fantastic coup by young Timothy Cratchit.
The financial wizard.
At only 7 years of age, the youngest millionaire in the vast Cratchit empire.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may steal a moment of your valuable time,
I would ask you to drink a toast to the sparkling good health of the two gentlemen whose industry and generosity have provided our sumptuous Christmas repast.
- Master Timothy Cratchit.
MRS. CRATCHIT: Tim.
And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
MRS. CRATCHIT: What are you trying to do, ruin our Christmas?
But his money paid for the goose, my dear.
No, your money paid for the goose, my dear.
But he paid me the money.
Because you earned it, my love.
Fifteen shillings a week at three pence an hour.
And not a penny rise in eight years.
Believe me, you earned it.
Oh, Mr. Scrooge assures me that times are hard.
He's right. For you they are.
But not for himself.
Well, nonetheless, he is the founder of our feast and we shall drink to him.
Quite right.
You, listen to this.
The founder of our feast indeed.
I wish I had him here.
I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon.
He'd have indigestion for a month.
CRATCHIT: Ethel, my dear, the children. It's Christmas.
It needs to be Christmas, Bob, to drink to a rotten, hard, stingy old miser like Scrooge.
- But, Ethel...
- You know he is, Bob.
Nobody knows it better than you, my poor love.
To Christmas, my dear.
Children, we shall drink to your father, for all the love and happiness he gives us.
And to Tiny Tim for the health we wish him.
And for the sake of your father,
I'll even drink to that old miser,
Mr. Scrooge.
Long life to him and to us all.
A Merry Christmas to us all.
Merry Christmas.
CRATCHIT:
God bless us.
God bless us, everyone.
As I said to the Lord Mayor, if Her Most Gracious Majesty is feeling bored, I said, you wheel her over to Camden town,
I said.
A glass of Bob Cratchit's hot punch and a song from Tiny Tim and we'll have her back on her regal feet in no time.
[KIDS LAUGH]
Well, there's your punch.
Now where's our song, my Tiny Tim?
KIDS: Tiny Tim.
- Come on, Tim.
- Song, song now.
- Come on, Tim.
[SINGING] On a beautiful day
That I dream about
In a world I would love to see
Is a beautiful place
Where the sun comes out
And it shines in the sky for me
On this beautiful winter's morning
If my wish could come true somehow
Then the beautiful day
That I dream about
Would be here and now
On this beautiful winter's morning
If my wish could come true somehow
Then the beautiful day
That I dream about
Would be here
And now
[ALL CLAPPING]
CRATCHIT:
Good boy.
MRS. CRATCHIT:
Well done, Tiny Tim, well done.
GHOST:
What an unpleasant child.
You know, Scrooge, there are few things more nauseating to see than a happy family enjoying themselves at Christmas.
Do you not agree?
I think Bob Cratchit's really rather fond of me.
Ho-ho-ho. And so is his wife.
Couldn't you tell?
She doesn't really know me.
That is one of the few things wherein fate has blessed her.
And, uh, what will become of Tiny Tim?
What's this?
Concern over a sick child?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Don't mock me, spirit.
Is the child very sick?
Not that it's of any great importance to me whether he is or not, but is he?
Well, of course he's sick.
You mean he's seriously ill?
Will he live? Well, will he?
What does it matter to you,
Ebenezer Scrooge?
If he's going to die, then he'd better do it and decrease the surplus population.
We have one more call to make.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please honor me with your undivided attention?
The time has come that I know you all look forward to in this house every Christmas Eve, when I ask you to drink to the good health and long life of my celebrated Uncle Ebenezer.
[DISCONTENTED CLAMOR]
Sounds to me as if he knows I'm here.
Of course he doesn't.
He can't see you.
Harry, I've visited you every Christmas for the past five years, and to this day I can never understand this extraordinary ritual of toasting the health of your old Uncle Ebenezer.
I mean, everybody knows he's the most miserable old skinflint that ever walked God's earth.
- Who's he?
- Oh, just a friend.
My dear Tom, it's very simple.
He is indeed the most despicable old miser, worse than you could ever possibly imagine.
[ALL LAUGH]
- You find this amusing?
- Believe it or not, he likes you.
HARRY:
You see, I look at it this way:
If I can wish a Merry Christmas to him, who is beyond dispute the most obnoxious and parsimonious of all living creatures...
ALL:
Hear.
HARRY: Then I know in my heart that I am truly a man of goodwill.
- Scoundrel.
- Wait, there's more to come.
And besides, I like old Scrooge.
- What did I tell you?
HARRY: Truly I do.
I can't help feeling that hidden somewhere deep inside that loathsome old carcass of his there's a different man fighting to get out.
Be careful, he may be worse than the one you know.
HARRY:
Oh, God forbid, Tom.
Anyway, that's the reason I ask him to come here every Christmas.
In the forlorn hope that one day he might pick up enough goodwill to raise his clerk's wages by five shillings a week.
MAN:
Hear, hear.
HARRY:
God knows it's high time he did.
He's playing with other people's money.
HARRY'S WIFE:
All right, Harry, that's enough.
I refuse to have Christmas haunted by Uncle Ebenezer.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
We'll have some dancing and some music.
Then we'll play some splendid party games.
There's a charming new game called The Minister's Cat.
It's very funny.
You'll all end up getting very angry when you lose.
And as for you, nephew, if you were in my will, I'd disinherit you.
Scrooge. Come over here.
You need some more of this.
Hmph. Raise my clerk's wages.
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
Mm. Mm.
[SCROOGE CHUCKLES]
[CHATTERING AND LAUGHING]
[CLAPPING]
I know that tune.
I used to sing it when I was a lad.
KEN:
The minister's cat is a lonely cat
GRAHAM:
The minister's cat is a languid cat
GORDON:
The minister's cat is a lordly cat
MARY:
The minister's cat is a lazy cat
GUY:
The minister's cat is a ludicrous cat
HARRY'S WIFE:
The minister's cat is a lascivious cat
JAMES:
The minister's cat is a...
- Too late, you're out.
- Oh, no.
He's out, he's out.
He's out.
You see, they get furious when they lose. It's lovely.
He's out, next M. Come on, M, M, M.
Now M.
The minister's cat is a marvelous cat
The minister's cat is a marmalade cat
- Marmalade.
- The minister's cat is a miserable cat
- Miserable.
- The minister's cat is a merciful cat
- Merciful.
- The minister's cat is a... Uh...
Merry, say merry.
[ALL LAUGHING]
- Oh, damn it.
- I told you to say merry.
Why are you so stupid?
He's always been stupid.
- Stop yawning when I'm talking to you.
- What next?
- N, N.
- N.
- The minister's cat is a naughty cat
- Quickly, quickly.
- The minister's cat is a noble cat
- Noble cat.
- The minister's cat is a nebulous cat
- Nebulous.
- The minister's cat is a...
- Nasty cat.
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, I'm not out.
- I was just about to say nasty.
- You fool, it's too late.
You could have said neglectful, nervous, nauseating.
You're out, you're out, you're out.
The minister's cat is an orange cat
- The minister's cat is an old cat
- Yes.
SCROOGE: Look, I was rather good at it but I... But I didn't...
Oh, thank you, my boy.
What a wonderful evening.
That Minister's Cat game, splendid.
I thought I was rather good at it.
Good night, good night. Thank you.
I can honestly say that I haven't enjoyed a Christmas as much as this since I was a young apprentice at old Fezziwig's so, so many years ago.
Yes.
What Christmases we used to have in those days.
Fantastic they were.
He had this daughter.
Reminded me a little bit of your mother, she did.
Her name was Isabel.
Oh.
Oh, Isabel.
WOMAN [SINGING]:
They say happiness
Is the folly of fools
Pity poor me, one of the fools
- Happiness
- Happiness...
Was standing beside me.
I could see her
She could see me
Happiness is whatever
You want it to be
Yes, Scrooge.
I have brought you home.
You're not going?
My time upon this little planet is very brief.
I must leave you now.
But we still have so much to talk about, haven't we?
There is never enough time to do or say all the things that we would wish.
The thing is to try to do as much as you can in the time that you have.
- Yes, but...
- Remember, Scrooge, time is short.
And suddenly, you're not there anymore.
SCROOGE:
No, wait. Don't go.
Don't leave me.
Where are you?
Why is it so dark?
I can't see.
I can't see, I can't see.
I can't see, I can't...
[PANTING]
Oh, my God. What am I doing here?
Oh, I'm in bed.
That's what I'm doing here.
This is where I'm supposed to be in the middle of the night.
Was I dreaming again?
I must have been.
That giant.
[CLOCK CHIMING NEARBY]
I must be mad. There are no giants.
[CLOCK BELL CHIMES]
There are no ghosts.
[GASPS]
Am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?
And you are to show me shadows of the things that will happen in the time before?
Is that so, spirit?
Ghost of the Future, I fear you more than any apparition I have seen.
But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to be another man from what I was,
I am prepared to bear you company.
Will you speak to me?
The night is waning fast and I know that time is precious to me.
Lead on, spirit. Lead on.
[THUNDER CRASHES]
There you are, me friends.
Shining as bright as the happy thoughts the mere mention of the name
Scrooge brings to our minds.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today because we are united by a common bond.
ALL:
Yeah!
Namely our feelings of gratitude to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
[CROWD CHEERS]
TOM: I don't think any of us can ever hope to find the words to describe the true depth of our feelings towards him.
[CHEERING AND CHATTERING]
Is this the future?
All right, my friends, all right.
I understand your excitement.
That's Tom Jenkins, the hot soup man.
TOM: We are all overjoyed...
- He owes me 6 pounds.
I must say he looks uncommonly happy for someone so deep in debt.
All these people owe me money.
They love me and I never knew.
Kindly hold down your emotions, if you please.
- Now, we are all deeply moved.
ALL: Yes.
And those of us what has been in debt to Mr. S over all these years will never forget what a rare and beautiful thing he has just done for us all.
- Right?
ALL: Right.
Three cheers for Mr. Scrooge.
- Hip, hip, hooray!
ALL: Hooray!
What did I do? What did I do?
Whatever it was, it has made them truly happy, and I am the cause.
My friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I shall remember this moment until my dying day.
[CROWD CHEERS]
ALL [SINGING]:
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
[CROWD CHEERS]
May I say in all humility
[ALL CHEER]
I have labored unceasingly all my life.
[ALL CHEER]
To be worthy of this moving demonstration of your feelings towards me.
[ALL CHEER]
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all the people who have assembled here
- I would merely like to mention if I may
ALL: You may.
[SINGING]
That our unanimous attitude
Is one of lasting gratitude
For what our friend
Has done for us today
[ALL LAUGH]
And therefore
I would simply like to say
ALL:
You may.
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
I may sound double Dutch
But my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war
Has been won for me
And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out
To add a sort of final victory touch
But since I left me flag at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very, much
[ALL LAUGHING]
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It sounds a bit bizarre
But things the way they are
I feel as if another life's
Begun for me
And if I had a cannon I would fire it
To add a sort of celebration touch
But since I left me cannon at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It isn't every day
Good fortune comes me way
I never thought
The future would be fun for me
- And if I...
- Hey.
You've woken my baby.
Will you keep quiet?
Beg your pardon, lady.
[SINGING QUIETLY]
And if I had a bugle I would blow it
Shh.
[SINGING LOUDER] To add
A sort of how's your father touch
But since I left my bugle at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much
No, no, dear friends.
It is I who should thank you.
- Thank you very much
- Thank you very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
The future looks all right
In fact it looks so bright
I feel as if they're polishing
The sun for me
- And if I had a drum I'd have to...
- If I had a drum I'd have to bang it
To add a sort of
Humpty Dumpty touch
But since I left me drummer at home
I'll simply have to say...
The color hurts my eyes.
I mustn't show weak eyes to your father when he gets home.
- It must be near his time.
- Past it.
But I think he's walked a little slower these last few evenings.
MRS. CRATCHIT: I've known him walk with Tiny Tim on his shoulder very fast indeed.
But he was light to carry for it was no trouble, no trouble.
Where is Tiny Tim?
Take me to him.
TINY TIM [SINGING FAINTLY]:
On this beautiful winter's morning
If my wish could come true somehow
Then the beautiful day
That I dream about
Would be here
And now
I must go now, my little fellow.
I promised your mother
I'd help her with the Christmas dinner.
I'll come and see you again tomorrow.
Same time.
All right?
[SOBBING]
Oh, Tim.
Poor Tiny Tim.
Spirit, you've shown me a Christmas yet to come that mingles great happiness with great sadness.
But what is to become of me?
No, no. Please, I beg you.
I've seen the error of my ways.
I will repent.
Truly, I will repent!
[SCREAMING]
Help! Help!
Help, help!
[RUMBLING]
[SNIFFS]
[MUTTERS]
[GRUNTS]
[SIZZLES]
VOICE:
Ah.
So there you are.
Marley.
Where am I?
I should have thought it was obvious.
I heard you were coming down today, so I thought I'd come to greet you.
Show you to your quarters.
[SCREAMING NEARBY]
Nobody else wanted to.
[SCROOGE WHIMPERING]
That's very civil of you, Marley.
- I am dead, aren't I?
- As a coffin nail.
[CLANKING]
- I'd rather hoped I'd end up in heaven.
- Did you indeed?
You may find your office here rather small, but not, I trust, unfamiliar.
Office?
Your activities in life were so pleasing to Lucifer, that he has appointed you to be his personal clerk.
A singular honor.
You will be to him, so to speak, what Bob Cratchit was to you.
That's not fair. Aah! It's...
- It's...
- Diabolical.
I must confess
I find it not altogether unamusing.
Here we are, my dear Ebenezer.
[BELL RINGS]
Your office.
It's freezing cold in here.
Lucifer turned the heat off.
He thought it might make you drowsy.
You'll be the only man in hell who's chilly.
Watch out for the rats.
They nibble things.
Rats?
[WHIMPERING]
MARLEY:
Oh.
I almost forgot.
I knew there was something.
They apologize that your
[CLANKING NEARBY]
Chain wasn't ready for your arrival.
It's so big, they had to take on extra devils at the foundry to finish it.
It's even bigger than I thought it would be.
Oh.
[SNICKERS]
Here it is now.
Don't let them do this to me, Marley.
I beg you.
That's quite a chain, isn't it?
Help me. Help me.
Bah, humbug.
Merry Christmas.
Don't leave me, Marley.
Help!
Help, help!
Help, help, help!
Help!
[GASPING]
Where am I?
I'm in my own room.
I'm not in hell at all.
I haven't got any chains.
Perhaps it didn't happen after all.
Perhaps it did.
But I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I've got a chance to change and I will not be the man I was.
I'll begin again.
I will build my life.
I will live to know that I've fulfilled my life.
I'll begin today.
Throw away the past, and the future I build will be something that will last.
I will take the time I have left to live and I will give it all that I have left to give.
[SINGING]
I will live my days for my fellow men
And I'll live in praise
Of that moment when
I was able to begin again
I will start anew
I will make amends
And I'll make quite certain
That the story ends
On a note of hope
On a strong amen
And I'll thank the world
And remember when
I was able to
Begin again
[LAUGHING]
I don't know what to do.
Yes, begin again.
I'm as light as a feather.
I'm as happy as an angel.
I'm as giddy as a drunken man.
A Merry Christmas, everybody.
Oh, Jacob Marley, wherever you are, you shall see a change in me, Jacob.
I swear it.
[LAUGHING AND YELLING]
Boy. Boy, boy, what day is it?
- Today?
- Today.
Why, Christmas day, of course.
It's Christmas day.
I haven't missed it.
The spirits have done it all in one night.
Well, they can do what they like, you see.
Of course they can.
Of course they can. Ha, ha.
- Hello, my fine young fellow.
- Hello.
Do you know the butcher's in the next street but one?
I should hope so.
What a remarkable boy.
An intelligent boy.
Do you happen to know if they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up in the window?
Not the big one, the enormous one.
What, you mean the one as big as me?
Ha, ha. What a wonderful boy.
So witty. It's a pleasure to talk to him.
- Yes, that's the one.
- It's still there.
It is? Go and buy it.
- What's that?
- Here's two sovereigns.
Go and wake up the butcher and tell him to open his shop.
Meet me there in ten minutes.
Be holding that turkey and I'll give you a half a crown.
Go on, run. Run, run.
Run, run.
Oh, what a lovely boy.
I think I'm gonna like children.
Now, that's what I call a turkey.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.
Come on, dear boy.
Let's go and open the toy shop.
Thank you. Merry Christmas.
And I'll have that and some of those.
And the hobby horse, and then some flutes and...
And some trumpets.
And that doll.
- And some bows and arrows.
- Bow and arrows.
Yes and... Oh, yes, and I...
- I must have a cricket bat.
- Ha, ha.
And these, and these.
And a horse and a spinning top.
And a piano.
And... And all those dolls.
- All of them?
- Yes.
I like that one.
Oh, and this beautiful coach.
- And several kites and the horse.
- Yes, yes.
- And these boats.
- Yes.
And some of these.
Oh!
I'll have that.
Now, how much is all this?
- Oh. Uh... Oh.
- Well, never mind.
Here are some sovereigns and you can keep the change.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Scrooge.
And I shall require the services of several small boys to help to transport these delightful objects to their destination.
And each boy shall receive a half a crown.
Half a crown, yes, Mr. Scrooge.
Mr. Scrooge, what has happened?
What happened is perfectly simple,
Pringle.
I've discovered that I like life.
[KIDS LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
I like life
Life likes me
Life and I fairly fully agree
Life is fine
Life is good
Especially mine
Which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
Life's a pleasure that I deny not
I like life, here and now
Life and I made a mutual vow
Till I die, life and I
We'll both try to be better somehow
And if life were a woman
She would be my wife
[KIDS LAUGH]
Why?
Because I like life
[KIDS CHEER]
SCROOGE:
Oh, look, a slide.
No, let me. Let me, let me.
[YELLS THEN GRUNTS]
[ALL LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
I like life
Life likes me
I'll make life a perpetual spree
Eating food, drinking wine
Thinking who'll have the privilege
To dine me
I like living the life of pleasure
Pausing only to take my leisure
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music and I'm in a trance
[PLAYING PLEASANT MELODY]
Tra-la-la, oom-pa-pa
Chances are I shall get up and prance
[SCROOGE HUMMING]
Where's there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
KIDS: Why?
- Why?
Because I like life
Uncle Ebenezer.
Oh, Merry Christmas to you, my dear nephew.
And to your enchanting wife.
We were just on our way to your house with some presents.
These are for you.
From an old fool who deeply regrets the Christmases gone by that he might have shared with you, and...
This is for you, my dear.
A sort of belated wedding present.
Oh, Uncle Ebenezer, thank you.
Christmas lunch is sharp at 3.
May we expect you?
You may.
I'll be there. Oh, you are a pretty girl.
[ALL SINGING]
I like songs, I like dance
I hear music and I'm in a trance
Tra-la-la, oom-pa-pa
Chances are
I shall get up and prance
Where there's music and laughter
Happiness is rife
Why?
Because I like life
Father Christmas
He's the greatest man
In the whole wide world
In the whole wide world
And he knows it
Every Christmas, Father Christmas
Puts a great big sack
On his dear old back
Because he loves us all
And he knows it
And he goes for a sleigh ride
If it snows, then he may ride all night
But that's all right
[LAUGHING]
KIDS:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
SCROOGE:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
KIDS: In the morning
SCROOGE: In the morning
KIDS: Christmas morning
SCROOGE: Christmas morning
If you lift your eyes
There's a big surprise
On your bed you'll see
There's a gift from Father Christmas
From Father Christmas
- That's how Christmas ought to be
- Ha, ha. Hey!
Merry Christmas.
A Merry Christmas to you, sir, from Father Christmas himself.
MRS. CRATCHIT:
Oh, dear.
Don't worry about your goose,
Mrs. Cratchit.
You can use it as stuffing for this.
Now, where are the other presents?
This dolly is for you, my dear.
And this one is for you.
And this pretty little dolly is for you.
It's the dolly in the corner.
[SCROOGE CHUCKLES]
- And those are for you, my boy.
- Thank you.
And these, Bob Cratchit, are for you and your good lady.
I must leave you now.
As you can imagine, it's a very busy day for me.
And I have many more calls to make.
Ah! I almost forgot.
[KIDS CHATTERING]
This is for you.
You didn't steal it, did you?
Ha, ha. No, I didn't steal it.
It's a present for you to keep.
A Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim.
You still don't recognize me, do you, Bob Cratchit?
Yes. Uh, no.
- You're Father Christmas?
- No.
[SHRIEKS]
It's Mr. Scrooge. He's gone mad.
It's all right, my dear.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
No, I haven't gone mad.
And on Monday when your salary will be doubled...
Doubled? He has gone mad.
- We'll sit together and discuss how I can help your family.
To start with, we'll find the right doctors to get Tiny Tim well.
And we will get him well, you know, Bob.
Yes, I believe you.
I'll believe anything.
And may this be the merriest
Christmas of all our lives.
[CHEERING]
Tom Jenkins, Tom Jenkins.
About that 6 pounds you owe me.
You agreed to give me a few more days, I just need...
You can keep it.
It's my Christmas present to you.
God bless you this Christmas day,
Mr. Scrooge.
Thank you very much.
[SINGING]
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It sounds a bit bizarre
But things the way they are
I feel as if another life's begun for me
And that goes for anyone else who owes me money, you can keep it.
As of this day, all my debts are ended.
[ALL SINGING] And if I had a drum
I'd have to bang it
To add a sort of
Humpty Dumpty touch
But since I left my drummer at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much
PUPPETS [SINGING]:
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
It isn't every day
Good fortune comes my way
I never thought
The future would be fun for me
And if I had a bugle I would blow it
To add a sort of
How's your father touch
But since I left my bugle at home
I'll simply have to say
Gentlemen, Merry Christmas.
ALL:
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.
Come to my office on Monday morning and I will give you a hundred guineas for your most worthy cause.
And the same every Christmas.
Thank you very, very much,
Mr. Scrooge.
[ALL SINGING]
Thank you very, very, very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
The future looks all right
In fact it looks so bright
I feel as if they're polishing
The sun for me
- Sing a Christmas carol
- Sing a Christmas carol
Sing a Christmas carol
Like the children do
And if I had a cannon I would fire it
To add a sort of celebration touch
And enjoy the beauty
All the joy and beauty
That a Merry Christmas...
And since I left my cannon at home
- I'll simply have to say
- Christmas is here
Thank you very, very, very much
Thank you very much
That's the nicest thing
That anyone's ever done for me
I may sound double Dutch
But my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war
- Has been won for me
- Come along, boys.
And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out
To add a sort of final victory touch
But since I left me flag at home
I'll simply have to say
[PANTING]
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very, very, very much
Merry Christmas.
[HUMMING]
CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHING]
Hello.
I don't know whether you can hear me, old Jacob Marley.
And I don't know whether or not
I imagined the things I saw.
But between the pair of us we...
We finally made a Merry Christmas, didn't we?
I have to leave you now.
Must go and get ready.
I'm going to have Christmas dinner with my family.
Well, here we are!
You're Tony and you're Tia.
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs. Grindley.
Oh, such fine-looking children.
I know you're anxious to see your rooms, but first we have some forms to fill out.
Then we'll join the others for dinner, all right?
Tia, what a pretty case!
Well.
It ain't nothing writing out those entry forms.
Wait'll she lays one of those enlightened punishments on you.
"After you watch the 5:00 news, you can write a 500-word composition."
Brother!
Tony, what should I put after sports?
Hmm, put "spectator."
Dumb pen's out of ink.
I'm finished. You can use mine.
Hey, I lost one just like this when I was coming in this barn.
- Tia's had that since Christmas.
- Sure she has.
Give it back!
Take it.
Now, children, that wasn't so difficult, was it?
No, ma'am.
Now, then.
Truck, I want you to wait for me in my office.
We'll read this together.
I keep forgetting what it feels like to sit down.
Now then, I know how both of you must feel.
Your foster parents are the only parents you remember.
Now that they've passed away, you're just a little bit scared.
We loved them very much.
Yes, ma'am, we miss them.
You only remember your adoptive name? Malone?
Tia was around three and I was five when the Malones adopted us.
Did either of you ever receive a birthday card from a relative?
Or perhaps a phone call at Christmas?
Something you may have forgotten.
Oft times the most trivial thing is important.
Tia?
What is it, dear? You look as though you're remembering something.
No. No, Mrs. Grindley. I'm sorry.
Why, there's nothing to be sorry about, dear.
You're out, Truck.
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something.
- Great catch!
- How'd you do it anyhow?
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.
Safe. There's something funny about this. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
Tony...
Cut it out, all right?
Ow!
Tony, why'd you do that?
You don't think we're gonna get away with it, do you?
You see?
Tony, you promised me and I promised you.
We wouldn't... You know, do the kind of stuff you did with Truck.
You remember how it used to be, when we thought it was all funny.
Like a game.
All the other kids thought we were some kind of freaks or witches.
I know, Tia.
We lost all of our friends until we quit doing all the spooky stuff.
You should've let Truck beat up on you.
Are you kidding? He's got five inches and 50 pounds on me.
Then you should've made it look like he was winning.
I suppose.
Tony?
Do you hear the dogs?
No. How far?
Oh, about 20 miles.
Big dogs, six or seven.
Yeah. I can hear them now.
That's awful far. Even for us.
Why are we hearing them, Tony?
I think it means that we're gonna see 'em someday.
If the bus is any later, Mrs. Grindley, we'll miss the beginning of the picture.
- Yeah.
- I'll see what's keeping them.
All right, Truck.
You guys, wanna see something really neat?
That's my star case, Truck.
And you're his sister.
Tony, please, not another fight.
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.
Give it back to Tia now.
I'll fight you with one hand.
I'll fight you with none.
Come on!
The bus is here.
Nice going, Winkie.
Hey, Tony and Tia, come on!
What's taking you? Come on!
Hurry up!
Tony, across the street!
Big car? What about it?
Something's going to happen to it.
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car.
There he is!
Come on!
Please, sir, don't get in that car.
It's no joke, sir.
See, my sister gets these feelings.
- So, you mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir.
Children, you know the rules about leaving the group.
No. I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- That's all right.
- Excuse us, please.
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.
The moon is moving into Aries.
Friday it will near the middle of the transit.
The bottom line, Mr. Michael-John.
The bottom line, Mr. Bolt, shows considerable indications of some advance toward your goals.
What about the house guru?
Do you concur, Ali?
There are profound vibrations, Mr. Bolt.
Are there indeed?
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.
Mysterious words and phrases have not added one red cent to my fortune.
Wealth, gentlemen, is like flesh.
It has to be nurtured and coddled.
Ah, Mr. Deranian.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bolt, but when you've heard my report,
I think you'll understand.
I have found what you're looking for.
Wait here a minute.
I haven't had a chance to thank you.
- Was the man in front all right?
- The chauffeur, yes. He's fine.
But then you knew he would be or you'd have had him get out of the car, too.
I suppose this sort of thing happens to you all the time, hmm, young lady?
Knowing about things before they really happen?
The lunch bell. We have to go.
Excuse me.
Those two children that just left.
I've been trying to think of their names.
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos.
Suppose somebody else had walked in?
Everybody knocks. Pine Woods' rules.
Look.
Must've happened when Winkie knocked it out of Truck's hands.
Can you fix it?
It's a map, isn't it?
"Stony Creek"?
"Misty Valley"?
It's funny, Tia, but every once and a while you get that look on your face.
Like you're remembering something.
I kind of do, but then I forget again.
It's not someplace big, like a state or a country.
But more like a road map.
I just don't know where.
When I can figure out where this place is, we'll go there.
Tony, what were you drawing?
It's the place where those dogs are.
They're barking now.
Yeah, I know. I was listening to them before you butted in.
I began to visualize this castle...
Tony, you can only visualize places we know something about.
Or places we're gonna be at.
I must've been drawing someplace we're going to.
Soon, Tony.
We're going there soon, and I'm afraid.
Since the Malones lived in a very small village,
I had little difficulty finding people who knew the children.
These insights, these sixth-sense incidents...
The postman, the schoolteacher, the woman who lost her parakeet, how do I know these aren't the result of your desperation?
Figments of your very fine imagination?
I have sworn affidavits.
People lie very easily. The very young can deceive the very wise.
I'm not lying.
If I'm in any way disappointed in this Tony and Tia, you are through here, Deranian.
Yes. I understand.
Then bring them here.
You say they have no family.
Well, now they do.
You are their family, Deranian.
You are their uncle, do you understand?
Perfectly.
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.
Whatever it takes. I will back you with every means at my disposal.
Just bring me the children.
I think there's no question, considering these documents your uncle has produced, that he has custody of you.
The judge signed those papers just today.
Mr. Deranian...
Uncle Lucas, Tony. Better get used to it.
Uncle Lucas, did you tell Mrs. Grindley about the first time we ever saw you?
Yes, he did.
The day the tow truck ran into your uncle's car.
That was a lucky day for all of us.
You see, Tia, you bear such a remarkable resemblance to Mr. Deranian's sister that he's convinced you both are her children.
My sister, your mother, died six years ago.
Now, if you have any doubts,
I'd be happy to show you these documents that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.
I won't have to leave Winkie, will I?
He's very smart and he knows how to deal with dogs.
Did I mention dogs?
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Grindley.
I'll see you out, Mr. Deranian.
Children, don't forget your coats.
Do you have any feelings about this Mr. Deranian?
Only that he isn't our uncle.
Must we leave, Tony?
That's what these papers mean.
We haven't got a choice.
It's all right, Lorko,
I'm just bringing through the children.
I'm sorry, but I'm allergic to cats.
Let us through.
Those are the dogs we heard.
There's the mansion.
Just the way you drew it, Tony.
Uncle Lucas, what's "Xzanthus"?
It's "Xanthus," Tony.
Mr. Bolt calls his house "Xanthus."
Who's Mr. Bolt?
Mr. Bolt is my employer.
And your host.
I have spacious apartments here.
And thanks to Mr. Bolt's generosity, they've been enlarged and redecorated to accommodate the two of you.
So, this is your long lost family?
You have a very beautiful niece, Deranian.
And a most attractive nephew.
You're Tony and you are Tia.
Here.
Our favorite flavors, vanilla and strawberry.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
After that long drive,
I'm sure you youngsters would like to see your quarters. Come with me.
Wow! It's beautiful.
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming.
Tony, look at that!
Hey, look!
Oh, wow!
Look at these dolls and stuffed animals.
Whoa!
Hey, Tony!
- When all this is completed...
- There's more?
Oh, yes!
We haven't had time yet to install the carousel or the gymnasium.
The tennis court's being resurfaced.
You can start your riding lessons first thing in the morning.
Oh, wow!
- We love horses.
- Oh, I forgot!
Winkie's private quarters.
Look, I think he likes it.
They're really great.
Of course, you still have your schoolwork.
Your tutors arrive the first of the week.
Mr. Bolt, where are the others?
- Other kids?
- Neighbors, I mean.
There are no neighbors.
Look out the window, go on.
Look as far as you can see.
Mr. Bolt owns everything in sight.
Well, I can see the sky.
I saddle him myself because this is your first time out, but one thing to remember, always mount a horse on his left side because...
Tia? You better pay attention or you'll be sorry.
Mr. Duncan, that horse over there.
That's old Thunderhead.
He's never been broke.
I don't envy the cowboy who'll try it.
I know it should be "ladies first," but I think if you show Tia how easy it is...
A little filly the size of your sister, sometimes they get scared.
Thunderhead, that's not nice.
My name's Tia.
And I want to be your friend.
All right, Thunderhead?
Tia! Stay away from him!
Hold on, now!
Good boy.
You know, I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
Tia! Come here.
Hey, Tony, why don't you try it without your harmonica?
I forget how.
Come to think of it, you can do a lot of things I can't.
Like working locks and the way you can talk to me without moving your mouth.
Maybe it's because you're a girl.
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.
Thank you, but we've a long way to go.
I'm having more hidden cameras installed and as soon as I have enough evidence,
I'm going to show the tapes to the children.
Good. If that doesn't put them on my team, then we'll have to resort to cruder methods of persuasion.
Tia?
Tia?
Tia, what's the matter?
Oh, everything and nothing.
I mean, maybe it's because we've gotten everything we've ever wanted.
More, even.
It's... I don't know.
It just doesn't leave us anything to wish for. Is that it?
I think so.
Tony, we've got to get out of here before it's too late, please.
- What do you see?
- Mr. Bolt, and he's mean.
He's never gonna let us go, Tony.
You're not always right about things like this.
I think this time...
This time...
You're right.
I've enjoyed this.
You should ask Uncle Lucas to arrange it so you can dine with me more often.
Thank you, Mr. Bolt.
We had some fine, stimulating conversation.
However...
Let us dispense with the kid gloves, and acknowledge the fact that we're dealing with two remarkable children.
Mr. Bolt, I really don't think you...
It doesn't matter what you think, Deranian.
If these youngsters are psychic, it's obvious they've begun to see through us by now.
- Don't lay all...
- You have power. I've seen it.
Now, I don't mean to ridicule those gifts of yours, as others might.
I revere them. Do you believe that?
What power do you mean, Mr. Bolt?
He knows. He knows all about us.
I don't think we know what you mean, Mr. Bolt.
What you did with Thunderhead and the marionettes.
And the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.
I want to know. I want to be able to understand these powers.
But that's impossible without your help.
You can make it possible.
You could walk across a field and tell where there's oil far beneath it.
You could foresee a revolution.
A natural disaster.
Please, Mr. Bolt, you're too excited.
You're going to make yourself sick.
You should go right to bed, sir.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
Anything.
Anything in this world you ask me for,
I'll bring you. Just never leave me.
Not another word. Into bed.
Uncle Lucas, you look like you could use some extra sleep yourself.
You heard what he said. He wants to learn all the things we know.
We couldn't teach him, even if we wanted to.
We... We don't know why we do all these things.
We don't know how it all started.
Tony, we've got to get out of here, please.
But to what, Tia?
Where do we go? Not to mention how.
The map.
- Mr. Bolt...
- Listen a second.
Don't lay all your cards on the table now.
They're very cunning.
I don't know the full extent of their powers.
Here they could escape.
But the chalet is an island in a sea of blinding snow.
They'll never escape from there.
Nutty as a fruitcake.
You see, we have to get out of here.
I know, but there's all that high fence
- and the guards...
- Children.
Finish up your ice creams and I'll show you to your bedrooms.
He's coming.
Come on.
So far, so good.
Come on!
Those dogs have ruined all my plans.
What do you mean, it's too late?
- Now!
- Dogs, stay.
Stay!
Good dogs.
There are some very bad men after us.
Go get 'em!
There's still the main gate.
They're not going to stop chasing us, even if we get past this gate.
Call Thunderhead.
Thunderhead, remember what I told you?
We're at the gate now.
- Lorko's on that lever.
- I'll help.
Winkie! Winkie!
Winkie!
Find them! I don't care how you do it.
Chase them on a magic carpet if you have to, but I want those kids back!
They rode out of here!
They're... They're quite a challenge.
I will not rest until I get those children back and neither will you.
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats.
Find them!
- You'll be all right here, big fella.
- Thank you, Thunderhead.
We'll miss you, Thunderhead.
Those sirens are for us.
We've got to keep moving. Come on.
They're getting closer.
Looks like you're taking a mighty long trip, friend.
Yeah, I figured I'd drive all over these United States.
Well, sir, a covered wagon pulling out of St. Joe didn't take near as much supplies as you got yourself here, Mr. O'Day.
You're sure one well-informed man, aren't you?
Now, do you think you could hand me that carton without straining yourself, or are you just tuckered out from sticking your nose in my affairs?
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.
Mister, if I did see 'em
I'd just as soon let 'em keep running.
As long as they're going opposite to where I'm headed.
Well.
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?
Hey, you're a friendly little fellow, aren't you?
Hey, I've got some canned tuna for you.
Hey, what are you doing here in my...
Uh, yesterday when I was loading supplies, they were looking for two kids.
Ah, a boy and a girl! You two.
Well, let's get one thing straight right here and now. I ain't no bus line.
And I ain't partial to hitchhikers.
And I don't like kids.
And what's more,
I'm a mean, impatient, selfish man, so come out of here and get on your way. Out! Out! Out!
Come on, out. On your way.
Wait a minute.
It ain't right for no human being to go hungry.
I'll make you some breakfast before you go.
Now don't get any ideas.
I got no patience with kids.
Especially runaways.
But it's just the opposite, sir.
We're trying to find where home is.
Excuse me, but did you see a black cat?
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?
Well, she's around somewhere.
Go on down to the water and clean yourselves off.
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.
You've got to be kidding.
Sorry, Mr. Deranian. No sign of them.
A grocer reported loading up one of these big campers, about the time they got away.
- They could have hidden in there.
- Any one of you spot a camper?
I let one go through.
The driver was alone.
Big fellow? Older guy?
A zip-up jacket with fair-colored hair?
That's the one. He was in a recreation vehicle heading north on highway L-38.
All right, north on highway L-38.
Now get out an APB on an RV heading north on L-38.
You see, Mr. O'Day, we don't expect to find our real parents, but maybe someone who knew them.
And can explain things to us.
We've got to make sure
Mr. Bolt and Deranian don't catch us.
Well, maybe that's the truth, and maybe it ain't.
But I'm not going to complicate things.
I'm gonna be on my way.
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had them in my...
I must have lost them out there.
You should have a spare key, sir.
I know that, young lady.
I am not a losing man.
Least not till you showed up.
Sir? Do you know a place called Stony Creek?
Stony Creek? Yes. Good fishing there.
- If we get the motor started...
- And clean up the back section...
Will you take us there?
Ah.
So that's it!
You're nothing but a conniving pair of undersized land pirates!
You swiped my keys to make sure you'd get a ride!
- Give me my keys.
- Sir?
The engine will start now.
All right.
You go back there and you clean up.
Make everything shipshape.
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.
You just remembered something.
It has something to do with the ocean.
Come on.
Go on back, clean up.
Let's get on the way.
Sure is a nice day.
Not with the prices you charge for gas.
Keep real still.
This fellow's acting mighty peculiar.
Nobody can know we're with you.
Maybe not. At least you'll be out of my hair by tomorrow.
We should make it to Stony Creek by then.
- How much?
- $10 even.
There you are.
Mr. O'Day? I think you bought too much.
Yeah, Winkie can't drink four quarts of milk between now and tomorrow!
Well, if you two weren't joshing me about Aristotle Bolt being after you, we might be together longer than we'd planned.
He's a powerful man, too po...
Motorcycle cop.
That attendant at the gas station.
You won't get in trouble, will you, Mr. O'Day?
It's not me he's after.
On second thought,
I might not drop you off too soon.
I might be able to squeeze an honest day's work out of you.
Take you fishing.
Deep-sea fishing, maybe.
Pit you two against half a ton of blue marlin.
Tia, what are you thinking about?
About before. It had to do with fishing.
- With Daddy Malone?
- No. No.
But we were on a boat.
A trawler.
Like Daddy Malone had.
That's all I remember.
Every law man in the county is probably looking for this camper.
There you are. Some hot chocolate?
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.
- What's that you have there?
- My star case.
Here. Let me show you what we found in the secret compartment.
- See where Stony Creek is, Mr. O'Day?
- Yes.
Well, there's a path that leads away from it. Up into some mountains.
We think that's where we may come from.
Somewhere in those mountains.
No, I don't think it was that way.
Not exactly.
There was an accident.
Well, go on!
I... It's gone.
What kind of an accident?
I don't know.
- In a car?
- No.
At... On the ocean!
Someone helped me save my star case.
Well, who?
Whoever put the map in the star case hid it so well, it took you all these years to find it.
That's right, Mr. O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe waiting for you to get old enough to do something about it.
Like now!
Very peculiar, huh?
I wonder...
I wonder how I'd handle you kids if you were mine.
Well...
Maybe that's why I never married, huh?
But, Mr. O'Day...
You were married.
What?
A long, long time ago.
And she was so pretty.
And you had a little house.
Yeah, I can see it.
It was white, with yellow shutters.
And there was a big elm branch over the whole roof.
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.
- What else?
- Well, your wife died.
Only a few months after you were married. And you were so sad.
You took an oath that you'd never give your love to another woman, or to anyone.
And you never have.
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Day.
The name's Jason.
If you know so dang much about me, you might as well use it.
- Jason, you understand?
- I like the name Jason.
We didn't mean to make you sad, Jason.
Come on. Are we going to dawdle here all night? Let's clean up here.
Get some sack time in.
We'll pull out of here a couple of hours before sunup.
They're headed towards Longview.
Do you understand that, Sheriff?
Mr. Deranian, $1,000 reward speaks mighty clear in these parts.
You can count on me.
- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- It's been a pleasure, a real...
A real pleasure.
Hey, Ubermann. Over there.
This time no mistake.
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.
My brother's house is about two miles outside of town up the north road.
His name is Hiram O'Day.
There's a car behind us, Jason.
Somewhere in Longview I'll find a place to make a fast turn and a quick stop.
You two jump out the side door and hide, you got that?
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie, now.
Yeah.
I'll keep going. If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.
You wait till he gets past.
Then we'll head for your brother's house, right?
Hiram O'Day.
Don't lose him.
Well, now! Welcome to Longview.
6:10 a.m. Okay, let's have your names.
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...
Castaway? That's no name, it's a word.
Your legal name is Malone, and don't go kidding me about that.
I think I'll let you see what lying to the law gets you.
Hmm.
In you go.
Tony, I've been thinking about why we would have said our name is "Castaway."
I think it might have something to do with us speaking another language.
- When the Malones took us in.
- Another language?
That's why we didn't talk for so long.
You mean we had to learn English?
We spoke a funny kind of language.
Uncle Bene spoke it to us.
Who's Uncle Bene?
I...
I think he died. Drowned.
What did he look like?
He had white hair...
I'll tell you, we don't want no panic around here, Sheriff.
Well, I've been in touch with Mr. Deranian and he's on his way.
I'll be home if you need me, Sheriff.
Tia, we've gotta think of something fast.
Hey, Tony, look.
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy.
Tia, we need my harmonica.
Now open the cell door.
When I get the star case, you run out to the edge of the woods.
As soon as I free the bear, I'll be there.
Tia, how do you expect us to get anyplace with a great big bear?
He's counting on me.
But this is an emergency.
Come off it, will you?
We still have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you start thinking about that?
Hey. Hey, what?
Get that thing off of me!
I just hope we don't have to pass a zoo before we get where we're going.
Look, I know what I saw!
And I say there's only one explanation!
Those two kids are witches!
And they're from Witch Mountain.
I want every available townsman to arm themselves, and we'll divvy up into hunting groups.
Hey, Sheriff. Whatcha gonna do, chase them all the way to Witch Mountain?
Yeah!
We'll stop them before they get there!
Now you listen close and I'll give you the areas to cover.
Those look like hunting parties.
They got away, Mr. Deranian, but we know what they are.
Evil itself. We got to catch them.
He's right. They're from Witch Mountain.
Sheriff, we need some more ammunition.
All right.
We'll get them, Mr. Deranian.
They've really got blood in their eyes.
There's no use trying to reason with them now, sir.
Security? This is Deranian.
I want a complete check on a Jason O'Day.
Tia, I know how you feel about the bear, and I think he's real neat too, but...
Well, a lot of people are gonna be looking for us, and he'll be safer on his own.
Anyway, they might shoot him.
Just for the sport of it.
Look.
He'll be safe there until tonight.
Then he can move on when it's dark.
Maybe you're right. I'll talk to him.
You be a good bear and wait in that cave.
We don't want anything to happen to you.
Tony, his feelings were hurt.
Watch it!
Jason!
Oh!
These woods are full of hunters looking for you. They think you're witches.
Brother Hiram ain't home, but I'll get you some food.
You'll have a good rest.
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day.
244 Cahill, just north of Longview.
Fifteen minutes.
We can be there in 15 minutes.
But I still can't figure out why we both came up with a name like "Castaway."
I noticed that you two are very smart for your years.
You really know what a "castaway" is?
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked and left on a desert island.
- Ah.
- Tony, I just remembered!
"Castaway." That's the name of someone we're supposed to see.
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing.
But suppose you two are castaways?
Then it would sure fit things Tia's been remembering.
Uh-huh.
We were in some kind of wreck, Jason.
And we were in the sea.
You mean like a boat sinking?
I guess. But if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.
We had an uncle.
Uncle Bene.
He kept us afloat. And then he drowned.
Oh.
For a long time we didn't understand anything anyone would say.
You must have come from some other country.
But we won't know all the truth until we get to the mountains above Stony Creek.
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.
My brother Hiram mentioned that place to me in his letters.
He said some strangers came and settled there, kept pretty much to themselves, and nobody ever knew where they came from.
You think they might be your people?
They must be!
Security? Have you notified Mr. Bolt of our destination?
Then do so.
We've just received communication from Mr. Deranian, sir.
He's on his way to a Mr. Hiram O'Day's cabin in the hills north of Longview.
- Don't just sit here, get going!
- Yes, sir.
Well, when Hiram gets home he's gonna find his cupboard is bare.
Gotta get going.
Come on, camper's out in back.
Tia!
Can you hear me?
We need another favor.
- Tia, come on.
- Come on, Tia.
There's no way we can get by them without their seeing us.
I remember more.
It wasn't just Uncle Bene who died in the ocean when our ship went down, a lot of other people died too.
And those people, the people that live here in these mountains, well, all of us came from the same country, but on different ships.
Why then now, you mean yours sank, and the others made it to port?
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place.
Yeah, a place that isn't there anymore.
Castaways?
That's why my people called themselves that, and...
And this was the emblem for where we used to live.
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.
It wasn't called that.
No. Two stars...
Because our world had two suns!
- Double stars!
- Another planet!
A whole other solar system!
Well, then... It wasn't a boat.
It was a spaceship!
Our planet was dying.
The only industry left was the manufacturing of spaceships.
Like ours.
And we had to find another planet to live on.
Then the other ships in your cluster landed here in these mountains, and yours didn't make it.
I think we might have been the only ones on our spaceship to have survived.
We lost them again.
We're going to go south on highway
211. Why don't you search the north?
Not too many people around, are there?
"Misty Valley Cooperative." This is it.
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.
We'll wait.
Are you the Longview bunch chasing after those two witch kids?
That's right, mister.
My name's Cort. You the guy's putting up the reward or what?
Yes, that's right.
Except that it's now $5,000.
- Five thousand, huh?
- But there's a catch.
I want those two children alive. I don't care what happens to the old man.
They were last seen in a camper headed this way.
Those words got a mighty good sound, friend.
Any idea where to look for them?
Well, they're not around here.
That's for sure.
Maybe the next town up the line.
Stony Creek?
Stony Creek?
We're changing course now.
They sure had time enough for a lunch break.
There's something to do with the phone book.
Let me have another look at that map.
Misty Valley Cooperative.
I was calling the Castaway family and I was wondering if...
It's all right.
Were you looking for Mr. Castaway?
Yes!
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!
- Is this Tony?
- Yes.
- Is Tia with you?
- Yes. Who is this?
Thank the blessed stars!
We've been searching for you for years.
Now listen carefully.
Everything must time out.
Take the back door and go to Mr. O'Day's camper.
Children, we want to make sure
Mr. Deranian doesn't lose you.
We have a plan that should discourage them from ever pursuing you again.
Come on! Come on!
Everything's all right, Jason.
You've got a funny idea of what's "all right."
Maybe Bolt can spot the RV from the helicopter.
Hey, men, come on!
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon. Headed north.
There's no way he can lose us in that monster he's driving.
Close in on them.
He's not exactly crawling.
They're getting closer, Tony.
Good driving, Al.
- How'd we wind up here?
- Another fine mess you...
- Come on, let's get out...
- Look out. The door!
Guys, let's go.
Very ingenious, Tony.
But don't forget, we want Deranian to see what's coming up.
I don't understand, sir.
Well, we have something planned that will convince Deranian and Bolt that you're both out of their reach forever.
Deranian, listen to me.
I spotted a route that lets you cut in ahead of them.
It's the second turn on the left.
Now signal the others not to follow you.
Repeat. Not.
Understood.
I don't believe it.
- It's what you call levitation.
- That ain't what I call it.
You two got powers beyond belief.
We're not doing this.
This is something too powerful for us to do.
Somebody else is making this happen.
Whoee!
That thing's flying upside down.
That's impossible.
That kind of vehicle can't fly upside down.
It's not supposed to fly at all.
They're not upside down. We are.
The voice says we should get out here and wait.
We'll never forget you, Jason.
Would you take care of Winkie?
Oh, no. Winkie's your cat.
It wouldn't be right for her to be with anybody else.
It would make us happy.
It sure would.
And I think Winkie would like it too.
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie how she feels about that.
Winkie, how do you feel about going around now with a crusty old man?
Look, if you don't mind...
I'd like to plan on, uh, remembering you two as if you were my kids.
The kids I never had.
Uncle Bene! Uncle Bene!
Uncle Bene!
Oh, you all did so well.
Congratulations, Jason O'Day.
You're a man of courage and compassion.
Uncle Bene, we thought you'd drowned.
Well, now if you know exactly what to say to a shark, he can be very accommodating.
Ah, Tia.
You never forgot.
You didn't lose the star case.
We only found the map a few days ago.
Well, I knew when you were old enough to understand it, you'd find it.
It's good to know that there are
Earth men such as you, Mr. O'Day.
If the stars are willing, perhaps some of the other children who survived will find men equally as kind.
- There are more?
- Yes.
All with star cases and maps.
So far, only Tia and Tony have found the way.
Well, now that I know what to keep my eyes peeled for, perhaps I could spot these surviving kids and bring them here.
Deranian's car.
I'll have to tend to Bolt's helicopter.
Stay and watch.
You'll see how we came into this world of yours.
What!
Stop this thing!
I'm all right! Where are the children?
I should've known there was more than ESP with those two.
Well, they're home now.
Have I intrud...
No, I didn't.
I didn't.
How dare you?!
I loved that gold watch!
All right, all right!
It wasn't a gold watch!
Yeah?
What... she looks like?
Hair?
Blond, stringy.
It's dirty probably.
Never washes it.
Eyes... blue.
Big blue eyes.
I think she's really very stupid, yes.
She looks stupid.
Stupid girl, yes.
Her nose has no character.
A punk nose.
Mouth is too tiny.
Narrow mouth.
Legs are alright.
Bosom?
She has no bosom.
No bosom at all.
Stop that!
You're very rude.
She has a very vivid imagination.
You know, she hears things.
Names... machine guns...
God knows what.
She thinks there's a war going on.
That's not all.
A little while ago...
...she thought she saw an unicorn.
Yes, I tell you.
Unicorn.
Of course it doesn't exists.
Anyway, it's a very insipid animal.
Oh God, she's moving about again.
Very curious.
What can I do?
She ran away...
The lady upstairs... she's dead.
But you don't hear me.
She's very dead.
No, you don't understand.
My name is Lily.
I see. Lily is your name too.
Funny. You spell it differently.
Who is he?
I'm sorry.
Your sister.
Yes, of course.
Your sister Lily.
But your mother is dead.
She passed away, I tell you.
She is dead! And I want you to know that it was not my fault!
Let me out!
Open the door!
Open it!
You! It's all your fault!
I'm not gonna stay on top here for very long. Do you understand?
If you think that you can keep me here forever, you're wrong!
Let me get out right away!
Right away! Let me out!
Help!
Someone!
You're really awful!
I hate you!
You stupid old bitch!
All right! If that what you want, don't let me out!
Don't! I don't care!
I hate you!
That...
- Hope.
- Hope.
Night of love... around us.
Eyes, days, stars shines for all remembered... in one slow breath.
- Merged.
- Merged... in one slow breath.
- But...
- The day hailed away... with all his gleam.
Mighty death.
- Magical.
- Magical death... threatening my life.
- How could my love die...
How could the endlessly living perish?
Yearning eternal blindness, where forever love and rapture await.
Heart on heart.
Mouth on mouth.
All is illusion.
Set us free of this world.
Dream of fire endless promise.
Our hearts wonder wish,
As full death, men named it evermore, beautiful delusion.
Sweet awaited desire.
Never waking.
Never fearing, nameless there.
Each to each, belonging.
With love alone, all life source.
Would you please tell me what's going on around here?
What?
They've taken the city.
Oh wooden horse, my God.
And Brian? Brian is dead you say?
What about Helen?
Hello?
Hello?
That radio gotta be fixed.
The girl.
She just lost her bloomers and now she's eating the cheese.
Of course, there was Christmas cheese.
I know what you think about.
I don't like it.
She'll find out about the greeks.
Come here dear!
Come, come, my little one.
I'll explain everything to you now.
Every single thing you want to know.
Don't! Don't!
There's nothing to see over there.
Oh no.
Please don't go near the window.
It's not safe!
She's looking out, the silly little bitch!
Damnit! I told you this would happen!
She's a conniving little slut!
I always knew it...
She's making a dash for the door.
Of course it's closed!
She's trying to open it, she's kicking it.
Now she's coming back, the little...
She just fell...
Now she's off the window...
Have you seen a unicorn?
Have you seen a unicorn?
Have you seen a unicorn?
Where is that unicorn?
Answer me!
Out, out, brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow.
Stupid, stupid tree.
Did you say something?
I said you're mean.
What do you mean 'mean'?
Why are you keep running after me?
I find it rather tedious.
What is it you want exactly?
I don't know really, but I'm not mean.
You're not?
What about those poor children...
I just saw you beating up?
- I'm not...
- Shut up, let me speak!
I saw how you kick that tree... and trampled those innocent flowers to death.
And you dare to say you're not mean?
You should practice what you preach!
You're eating the flowers.
Suppose we change the subject?
I don't mean to be rude, but you're not very graceful.
In my books, unicorns are slim and white.
The most beautiful things in the world are the most useless.
Peacocks and lillies, for instance.
You know, the old lady upstairs.
She doesn't want me to see you.
Oh Lord, you mean that babbling-beady-on-the-while upstairs.
Don't pay any attention to her.
She's not even real.
What do you mean she's not real?
I touched her, I spoked her, I even saw her die.
I mean what I mean.
Little one, I could give you some precious information... concerning that old hag.
Lunatic driving baddie.
I'm leaving right away.
And I won't be back in 154 years.
Hey, come back!
I like talking to you.
Nobody talks to me here.
Humphrey.
What's the matter?
What's the matter now?
Who's Humphrey?
- You mean the rat?
- Yes, I mean the rat.
Did you had a fight?
Yes, but that's nothing new.
He's so opinionated and stubborn.
I love him, you understand my sweet thing?
We went in so many roads together.
So many seasons I've seen us passed.
So many hopes...
I see the waves in the ocean.
Hungry, hungry.
Just a minute, please.
Just a minute.
I'm afraid I don't have much milk.
Hey! Your friend is back.
Willy boy, Willy boy,
Where are you going?
I'll go with you, if I may.
I'm going to the meadow to see them...
I'm going to help them make the hay.
I'm going to help them fill the barn,
with summer hay to lay upon.
Nobody home
No bread, no drink, no money how we none
yet we shall be bliss.
Nobody home.
No bread, no drink, no money how we none.
yet we shall be bliss.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Is nobody's there?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Anybody hear me?
Just a minute, please.
All right, what's it going to be?
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.
A Sizzler for June Marie.
And listen!
- Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?
This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?
Do you ask a fish how it swims?
Or a bird how it flies?
No, you don't.
They were born to do it.
Just like Willy Wonka was born to be a candy man...
...and you were born to be a Wonkerer.
Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two
The Candy Man!
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
Who can take a rainbow
Wrap it in a sigh
Soak it in the sun
And make the strawberry-lemon pie
The Candy Man?
The Candy Man!
The Candy Man can!
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world...
...taste good
Willy Wonka makes
Everything he bakes
Satisfying and delicious
Talk about your childhood wishes
You can even eat the dishes
Who can take tomorrow
Dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream
- The Candy Man
- Willy Wonka can
The Candy Man can
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
And the world tastes good
'Cause the Candy Man thinks it should
Hi, Mr. Jopeck.
Come along, Charlie.
You're late.
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.
You're right.
- There you are.
- Thanks.
Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
Up the airy mountain...
...down the rushing glen.
We dare not go a-hunting...
...for fear...
...of little men.
You see...
...nobody ever goes in...
...nobody ever comes out.
Charlie's late.
He works too hard for a little boy.
He should have some time to play.
Not enough hours in the day.
With you four bedridden for 20 years...
...it takes work to keep this family going.
If only his father were alive.
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.
In all the years you've been saying that...
...I've yet to see you set foot on the floor.
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...
Hi, everybody!
Wake up, Charlie's home!
Grandpa George.
Grandma Georgina.
Grandma Josephine.
Grandpa Joe!
Is this your supper, Grandpa?
It's yours, too.
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!
It's all we have!
What are you saying?
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?
What difference does it make where? He got it.
My first payday.
Good for you.
We'll have a real banquet.
Mom?
Here's what's left.
You keep it.
Except for this.
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.
When bread looks like a banquet,
I've no right to tobacco.
Go on, Grandpa.
Please take it.
After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.
There was this strange man there.
I think he was a tinker.
He was standing behind me looking up at the factory.
Just before he left he said...
"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out. "
And right he was, Charlie!
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka locked it.
Why did he?
Because all the other chocolate makers were sending spies...
...dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.
Especially Slugworth.
That Slugworth was the worst!
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!"
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.
He locked the gates and vanished completely.
And then, suddenly, about three years later...
...the most amazing thing happened.
The factory started again, full blast!
And more delicious candies were coming out than ever.
But the gates stayed locked.
So that no one...
...not even Slugworth, could steal them.
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.
Thousands must be.
But who?
Who are they?
That is the biggest mystery of them all.
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?
I need an assistant.
Give me a hand.
We have nitric acid, glycerin...
...and a special mixture of my own.
Together it's dangerous stuff, blows you up.
But mixed together right, as only I know how, what's it make?
- I don't know.
- Of course not!
Because only I know.
If you knew, you'd be teaching me instead of me teaching you.
And for a student to teach his teacher is presumptuous. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Mixed together in the right way, these dangerous ingredients...
...make the finest wart remover.
The trick is to pour equal amounts.
Charlie, you take the nitric acid and glycerin...
...and I'll take my special mixture.
Ready?
Good lad. Pour.
Did we do it wrong?
Certainly not.
This is for big warts.
What's going on out there?
Come here! What's happening?
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!
Are you sure?
He's giving lots of chocolate away!
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for 5 people!
Class un-dismissed.
He hid 5 Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.
- Where'd he hide them?
- Inside 5 Wonka Bars, you must buy them.
Class re-dismissed!
Now, details of the announcement...
...that has captured the world's attention.
Hidden among the billions of Wonka Bars...
...are 5 Gold Tickets.
And to the 5 people who find them will come the most fabulous prize.
A lifetime supply of chocolate.
If this were not enough, each winner, before receiving his prize...
...will be personally escorted...
They're all crazy!
The man's a genius!
He'll sell a million bars.
Do you think I've got a chance to find one?
One?! I'm counting on you to find all five!
One's enough for me.
We have reports...
...the response is phenomenal!
Wonka Bars...
...are disappearing...
...at a rate to boggle the mind.
It is incredible...
...the way Wonkamania has descended upon the globe.
While the world searches, we watch and wait, wondering...
...where it will lead, and how long the spirit will hold up...
...under the strain.
I still have these dreams, Doctor,
And I still can't stop believing them.
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder...
...to believe in dreams is a manifestation of insanity.
The sooner you accept this, the sooner you'll get well.
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.
What did he say?
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.
- You said...
- Shut up and tell me where's the ticket!
We begin with 5 Golden Tickets.
Like 5 lucky bolts of lightning ready to strike at any point on the map.
No one knew where or when the first one would hit.
But last night we got our answer.
While America slept, the first Golden Ticket was found...
...in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.
We've been waiting for the story, and we're ready with a live report.
Proud we are, for the attention of the world...
...focuses today here in Duselheim.
A community thrust into prominence...
...by the discovery of the first Wonka Golden Ticket.
Its finder is the son of a prominent butcher.
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!
The pride of Duselheim, the fame of Western Germany.
An example for the whole world.
How does it feel to be the first Golden Ticket finder?
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...
Mrs. Gloop, would you say a few words to the audience?
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.
He wouldn't do it unless he needed the nourishment.
Happy birthday, Charlie!
Here you are, Charlie.
Thank you.
It's terrific!
We each knitted, Grandmas
Georgina, Josephine and me.
I did the end pieces with the tassels.
And here's a little gift from Grandpa George and me.
I think I know what this is.
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.
Let's see that Golden Ticket.
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- Don't raise his hopes.
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!
Stop it!
- I've got the same chance as anybody!
- You've got more.
You want it more.
Go on, open it!
Here goes!
- I got it!
- Where?
Let's see!
Fooled you, didn't I?
You thought I really had it.
Never mind, Charlie.
You'll find one.
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!
I wanted to find the first
Golden ticket, Daddy!
I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.
I've got every girl on staff hunting for you.
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!
Give me time!
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?
For five days now, the entire factory's been on the job!
They haven't shelled a peanut since Monday!
They've been shelling chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!
Work nights!
Come along, you girls!
Put a jerk in it, or you'll be out on your ears!
And listen: The first girl...
...that finds a Golden Ticket gets a bonus in their pay packet!
What do you think of that?!
They're not even trying!
They don't want to find it!
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.
19,000 bars an hour they're shelling!
760,000 they've done so far!
You promised!
You promised I'd have it the first day!
You're going to be very unpopular if you don't deliver soon.
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.
I won't talk to you!
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!
I won't go to school!
Veruca! Sweetheart! Angel!
There are only 4 tickets left in the world...
...and the whole world's hunting for them!
What can I do?
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!
About time, too! I want it!
Give me my ticket! It's mine!
I found the Golden Ticket!
Thank God!
Happiness is what counts with children.
Happiness and harmony.
This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...
...the mad craze that's sweeping the world.
Whatever corner of the globe we are in, whichever continent we're on...
...the great Wonka Bar search continues.
We're near the end...
...of our 43rd day in the Golden Ticket hunt.
Everywhere, are signs of anxiety.
Every hour...
...new shipments are sent around the globe.
But they're not moving fast enough.
And as time passes the men who seek them become more and more desperate.
Gentlemen, I know how anxious you've been during these last few days.
But now I think I can safely say...
...that your time and money have been well spent.
We're about to witness the greatest miracle of the machine age.
Based on the revolutionary law of probability, this machine...
...will tell us the precise location of the three remaining...
...Golden Tickets.
It says...
..."I won't tell.
That would be cheating. "
I am now telling the computer...
...if it will tell me the correct answer
I will gladly share with it...
...the grand prize.
He says...
..."What would a computer do with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"
I am now telling the computer exactly what he can do with the chocolate.
It can happen here, too, unbelievable as it sounds...
...right here in America.
Where even in the smallest town, the happiest dreams can come true.
Here she is...
...Violet Beauregarde, finder of Golden Ticket number 3.
From Miles City, Montana.
And the proud parents.
Mr. Beauregarde, a local politician, civic leader...
Sam Beauregarde,
Square Deal Sam to you...
...with great giveaway bargains.
The finest values in the entire country!
- Here's a sedan...
- Dad, they don't want you!
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure!
Here is Golden Ticket number 3, and it's all mine!
I'm a gum chewer, but when I heard about the tickets...
...I laid off gum and switched to candy.
Now, of course, I'm back on gum.
I chew it all day, except at mealtimes when I stick it behind my ear.
- Violet!
- Cool it, Mother!
This piece of gum I've been chewing for three months. A world record!
It beat the record held by my friend, Cornelia...
...and was she mad!
Hi Cornelia, sweetie!
Let me just say, if any of you folks watching...
- What are you doing here?
- I'll walk you home.
I'm not ready.
I'm going to be here late.
Then I guess I'll be going.
Why not stay a minute.
Pull up a pile of clothes and sit down.
School all right?
Yep.
Good.
Go on your newspaper route?
Just finished.
Good.
I wanted to tell you something.
They found the third ticket.
Did they?
I guess I'll be going now.
That's all?
I thought you'd like to know.
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.
There are only two tickets left, you know. Just two.
Pretty soon, just one.
I wonder who'll be the lucky ones.
If you're wondering, it won't be me.
If you're wondering, you can count me out.
There are 100 billion people...
...and only 5 will find Golden Tickets.
Even with a sack of money, you probably wouldn't find one.
When this is over you'll be no different from billions of others who didn't.
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.
When? When will they change?
Probably when you least expect it.
See you later.
You get blue like everyone
But me and Grandpa Joe
Can make your troubles go away
Blow away
There they go
Cheer up, Charlie
Give me a smile
What happened to that smile I used to know
Don't you know your grin
Has always been my sunshine
Let that sunshine show
Come on, Charlie
No need to frown
Deep down you know
The world is still your toy
When the world gets heavy
Never pit-a-pat 'em
Up and at 'em, boy
Some day...
...sweet as a song
Charlie's lucky day will come along
Till that day you've got to stay strong, Charlie
Up on top is right where you belong
Look up, Charlie
You'll see a star
Just follow it
And keep your dream in view
Pretty soon the sky is going to clear up, Charlie
Cheer up, Charlie, do
Cheer up, Charlie
Just be glad you're you
While the world searches...
...here it has actually happened.
There's only one Golden Ticket left in the entire world.
Because right here, in Marble Falls, Arizona...
...is lucky winner number four!
The name to be heard around the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee!
Can we shut that off?
- Are you crazy?
- He won't answer till station break.
The country wants to hear from you!
Can't you shut up?
I'm busy.
What a show!
I serve all his dinners here.
He's never been to the table.
- You love TV?
- You bet!
About that Golden ticket...
I want to catch this!
- Like killings?
- What do you think life's all about?
Mike, would you tell us if...
Wait till I get a real one.
Colt 45.
Pop won't let me have one yet, will you?
Not till you're 12, son.
Four down, one to go.
And somewhere out there another lucky person is moving closer...
...to finding the last of the most sought-after prizes in history.
Though we can envy him, whoever he is...
...and might be tempted to be bitter at our losing...
...we must remember there are more important things.
Many more important things!
Offhand, I can't think of what they are but I'm sure there's something.
Now for weather and...
Why did you wake me up?
Is something wrong?
Grandpa!
That money was for tobacco.
I've told you, I've given it up.
Go on, open it!
One ticket left.
Let's see that gold.
No, you do it. I can't.
We're going to be lucky this time.
I've got a funny feeling inside.
Which end shall I open first?
That end. Just a tiny bit.
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.
- You finish it! I can't.
- No, Grandpa! You do it.
All right.
Here goes.
You know...
...I bet those Golden Tickets make the chocolate taste terrible.
Lot 403.
I can personally guarantee...
...that this is the absolutely last case of Wonka Bars...
...left in the United Kingdom.
Shall we start the bidding at
1,000 pounds? Do I hear 1,000?
1,500 pounds?
I have 2,500.
4,500 pounds?
Your Majesty!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.
There isn't anything to give us a clue.
They kidnapped my husband
12 hours ago.
When will we hear?
What do they want?
Stay calm. They want ransom.
We wait to hear their demands.
I'll give them anything they want.
All I want is Harold back!
Go ahead, we're listening.
Whatever they asked for they can have it.
They want your case of Wonka Bars.
Did you hear me?
It's your husband's life or your Wonka Bars.
How long do I have to think it over?
That's it!
The Wonka contest is all over.
The final ticket has been found...
...we've got a live report in from
Paraguay, South America.
It is finished.
The end has come.
The last Golden Ticket has been found...
...right here in Paraguay.
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta...
...the millionaire owner of South America gambling casinos.
Here is the most recent picture of the happy finder.
Turn it off!
Well, that's that.
No more Golden Tickets.
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.
A boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?
Who's going to tell him?
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.
Yeah, let him sleep.
Let him have one last dream.
I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.
Which means Friday's test on what we learned during the week...
...will now be Monday before we've learned it.
Since today's Tuesday, it doesn't matter.
Pencils ready!
Today, we are going to learn about...
...percentages.
For example, let's take the recent unpleasantness.
Suppose there are
1,000 Wonka Bars in the world...
...and you each opened a certain number of them.
That number is...
...a percent. Understand?
Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?
About 100.
There are ten 100's in 1,000, therefore, you opened 10 percent.
Peter Goff, how many did you open?
10% half over again, which makes
15 percent. Charlie Bucket!
- How many did you open?
- Two.
That's easy. 200 is twice...
Not 200.
Just 2.
What do you mean, you only opened 2?
I don't care much for chocolate.
I can't figure out just 2!
Let's pretend you opened 200.
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars, apart from being dreadfully sick...
...you'd use 20% of 1,000...
...which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent...
I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.
Why, sure.
What kind?
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious?
- Whichever's biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious.
Now that the tickets are found,
I don't have to hide them.
Take it easy!
You'll get a stomach ache.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, now.
I think I'll buy just one more, for my Grandpa Joe.
Sure.
Try a regular Wonka Bar.
Fine.
- Take it easy! One at a time!
- Did you hear the news?
That gambler from Paraguay made a phony ticket.
There's one Golden Ticket still floating around.
The nerve of that guy!
Trying to fool the world!
He was a crook! This means the contest goes on forever.
You got the last Golden Ticket!
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!
Stand back!
Leave the boy alone!
Break it up!
Charlie! Hold onto that ticket!
Run for it! Run straight home!
Don't stop till you get there!
I congratulate you.
Well done.
You've found the fifth Golden Ticket.
May I introduce myself?
Arthur Slugworth.
President of Slugworth Chocolates.
Listen carefully, because
I'm going to make you very rich.
Mr. Wonka is working on a fantastic invention.
The Everlasting Gobstopper.
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.
I want you to get just one
Everlasting Gobstopper...
...and bring it to me so I can find the secret formula.
Your reward will be...
...10,000 of these.
Think it over, will you?
A new house for your family...
...food and comfort for the rest of their lives.
And don't forget the name...
...Everlasting Gobstopper.
I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.
The last one's fake!
It's in the paper!
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar and the ticket was in it!
Look at it! See for yourself!
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket...
"... from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present this ticket at the factory gates...
"... at 10 o'clock in the morning,
October 1st, and do not be late!"
"You may bring with you one member of your own family, but no one else.
"In your wildest dreams you could not imagine...
"... the marvelous surprises that await you!"
You've done it!
It says I can take somebody with me.
I wish you could go.
Charlie!
That's good, Charlie.
Now help me up.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, Charlie.
Watch it, Joe!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Up and about!
I haven't done this in 20 years!
I never thought my life could be
Anything but catastrophe
But suddenly I begin to see
A bit of good luck for me
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a golden twinkle...
...in my eye
I never had a chance to shine
Never a happy song to sing
But suddenly half the world is mine
What an amazing thing
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
It's ours, Charlie!
I've got a golden sun up in the sky
Slippers, Charlie!
I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say
Good morning
Look at the sun
I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done
But it can be done
The cane, Charlie!
Here I go!
Watch my speed!
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But nevertheless it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a golden chance to make my way
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day
Good morning! Look at the sun!
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done
But it can be done
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But, nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a Golden Ticket
I've got a golden chance to make my way
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day
Stop! It says the first of October.
That's tomorrow.
We've got a lot to do! Comb your hair, wash your face, polish your shoes...
- I'll take care of everything.
- We don't have much time.
Grandpa... on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!
How do I look?
- You guys ready?
- You're on.
This is the big day.
The day Willy Wonka will open his gates and shower gifts on the 5 lucky winners.
From over the globe, people have gathered, waiting for the hour...
...to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.
Hi, friends! Don't forget to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...
Cut it out, Dad!
This is my show!
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?
I want to go in first, before anybody.
Anything you say.
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.
To see the greatest of them all,
Mr. Willy Wonka!
Thank you.
Welcome, my friends.
Welcome to my chocolate factory.
Would you come forward?
Get back!
Come on, Veruca!
That's Slugworth, the man I told you about.
Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.
I'm so glad you could come.
This is going to be such an exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.
I think you will.
Please show me your Golden tickets.
I'm Veruca Salt.
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!
You look pretty in that mink coat!
I've got three others.
Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?
Augustus Gloop.
Augustus, my dear boy!
Good to see you, and in such fine shape!
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.
What kind of gum you got?
Charming!
Sam Beauregarde here!
What a genuine pleasure.
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"
I'm Mike Teevee.
Wham, you're dead!
Wonderful to meet you!
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.
Charlie Bucket.
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who's this?
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.
Delighted.
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.
Are we ready?
Yes! Good!
In with you!
Hats, coats, galoshes over here.
Hurry, we have so much time and so little to see.
Wait a minute! Strike that.
Reverse it. Thank you.
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.
Boy, what weird coat hangers!
Surprises around every corner, but nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.
As soon as your outer vestments are in hand...
...we'll begin.
Now...
...will the children kindly step up here.
Accidents? What kind of accidents?
I didn't know we had to sign anything.
I can't read the bottom.
Violet, you first.
Sign here.
Hold it!
Let me through.
Don't sign anything.
What's this about?
Standard form of contract.
Don't talk contracts, I use them myself.
They're for suckers.
You wouldn't begrudge me a little protection? A drop?
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.
I'm sorry. House rules.
- I want to go in. Don't try to stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.
Nicely handled! She's a girl who knows where she's going.
What's all that small print?
Any problems? Dial Information.
Thanks for calling.
I assume there's an accident indemnity clause?
Never between friends.
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed his wife's insurance policy.
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.
What about me, Grandpa?
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.
Let's go in! Come on!
Patience.
Everything has to be in order.
Everyone signed? Yes?
Good. On we go!
Ninety-nine...
...forty-four...
...one hundred percent pure.
Just through the other door, please.
There's some mistake here.
There is no other door.
There's no way out!
I know there's a door here someplace.
I don't like this, Wonka!
Is this a trick?
Mr. Wonka, help!
I'm getting squashed!
Save me!
Is it my soul that calls my name?
Let me out or I'll scream!
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!
Question time will come at the end of the session. We must press on.
- Here we are.
- Don't be a fool.
That's the way we came in.
It is? Are you sure?
We've just come through there.
How do you like that?
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka?
A funhouse?
Why? Having fun?
I'm not going in there.
We're getting out of here.
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.
Better press on.
- The room is getting smaller.
- No, it's not!
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.
You can't squeeze me through that door.
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.
My dear friends...
...you are now about to enter the nerve center...
...to the entire Wonka factory.
Inside this room, all of my dreams become realities.
And some of my realities become dreams.
And almost everything you'll see is eatable... edible.
I mean, you can eat almost everything.
Let me in, I'm starving!
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.
We wouldn't want to lose that.
Yet.
Now, the combination.
This is a musical lock.
Rachmaninoff.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...boys and girls...
...the Chocolate Room.
Hold your breath. Make a wish.
Count to three.
Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look
And you'll see into your imagination
We'll begin
With a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world
There's nothing to it
Hurry, Violet!
This way, Grandpa!
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there
You'll be free
If you truly wish to be
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world
There's nothing...
...to it
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there
You'll be free
If you truly...
...wish to be
What a disgusting, dirty river!
It's industrial waste.
A ruined watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.
It's chocolate.
That's chocolate?
That's chocolate.
A chocolate river.
The most fantastic thing I've ever seen.
10,000 gallons an hour.
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.
No other factory in the world mixes chocolate by waterfall.
But it's the only way if you want it just right.
Grandpa, look over across the river!
Little men!
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!
Now we know who makes it.
I never saw anybody with an orange face before.
Funny looking people.
What are they doing?
Creaming and sugaring time.
- They can't be real people.
- Of course, they're real people.
Nonsense!
No, Oompa Loompas.
From Loompaland.
Loompaland?
There's no such place!
Excuse me, dear lady...
I teach geography.
Then you know all about it.
And what a terrible country it is.
Nothing but desolate wastes and fierce beasts.
The poor little Oompa Loompas were so small and helpless...
...they would get gobbled up.
A Wangdoodle would eat ten of them for breakfast.
And so I said...
"Come and live with me in peace and safety...
"... away from all the Wangdoodles and Hornswogglers...
"... and Snozzwangers and rotten Vermicious Knids. "
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?
I'm sorry, questions must be submitted in writing.
So, in the greatest of secrecy...
...I transported the entire population of Oompa Loompas here.
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!
All right, I'll get you one before the day's out.
I want an Oompa Loompa now!
Can it, you nit!
This is terrific.
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.
Augustus, sweetheart, save some room for later.
Don't do that! My chocolate must never be touched by human hands.
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!
Please, I beg you!
Augustus!
My chocolate!
Help!
My chocolate!
My beautiful chocolate!
Don't just stand there!
Do something!
Help. Police. Murder.
Grab this!
What's happening to him?
- Looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!
- Save him!
- It's too late.
- Too late?
- He's had it now.
- The suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back!
Where is he?
Watch the pipe.
How long is he going to stay down?
- He can't swim!
- No better time to learn.
His coat's going up the pipe!
Call a plumber!
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?
It's his stomach.
- He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.
I wonder how long it's going to take?
The suspense is terrible.
I hope it'll last.
He'll never get out.
Yes, he will.
Remember you once asked me how a bullet comes out of a gun?
He'll be marshmallows in 5 seconds!
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?
Because that pipe goes to the Fudge Room.
You terrible man!
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room, but look sharp...
...or her boy will get in the boiler.
You boiled him up!
Nil desperandum. Across the desert lies the promised land.
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got a perfect puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
What do you get when you guzzle down sweets?
Eating as much as an elephant eats
What are you at getting terribly fat?
What do you think will come of that?
I don't like the look of it
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
If you're not greedy, you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do
What kind of place you running here?
What's he talking about?
Wow, what a boat!
Looks good enough to eat!
That's a nice little canoe.
"All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. "
All aboard!
Ladies first.
That means Veruca.
If she's a lady,
I'm a Vermicious Knid.
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.
She's très jolie, but is she seaworthy?
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.
- You took good care of that August kid.
- Everybody aboard!
You're going to love this.
Just love it.
I want a boat like this. A beautiful paddle boat, that's what I want.
What she wants is a kick in the pants.
I'm going to be seasick.
- Try one of these.
- What are they?
Rainbow drops.
You can spit in 7 colors.
Spitting's a dirty habit.
I know a worse one.
- What business are you in?
- Nuts.
Where are we going?
I don't like that tunnel.
I want off!
Around the world and home again.
That's the sailor's way!
I don't like this ride, Daddy!
We're going too fast!
We're going to sink!
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?!
- Faster!
Close your eyes and hang on tight!
- What is this, a freak-out?!
- This isn't funny!
You can't possibly see where you're going!
You're right. I can't.
This would make a great series!
- This is kind of strange.
- Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun!
I want to get off the boat, Wonka!
I may get sick!
This is going too far!
Tell that little guy to turn us around!
Now I am going to be sick!
There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing
Is it raining
Is it snowing
Is a hurricane a-blowing
Not a speck of light is showing, so the danger must be growing!
Are the fires of hell a-blowing?
Is the grizzly reaper mowing?
Yes!
The danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing!
And they're certainly not showing...
...any signs that they are slowing!
Make him stop, Daddy!
- This has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir.
Stop the boat!
- We're there.
- Where?
Here.
A small step for mankind, but a giant step for us.
All ashore!
Let me off this freight!
- Why don't they show that stuff on TV?
- I don't know.
What a nightmare!
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.
"Dairy cream. "
"Whipped cream. "
- "Coffee cream. "
- "Vanilla cream. "
"Hair cream?"
That's not French.
I can't take much more.
The Inventing Room.
Now remember, no messing about.
No touching, no tasting, no telling.
No telling what?
All of my most secret inventions are cooking and simmering in here.
Old Slugworth would give his false teeth to get inside for five minutes.
So don't touch a thing!
Inventing room?
Looks more like a Turkish bath.
Even if Slugworth did get in here, he couldn't find anything.
- You got a garbage strike?
- Who does cleaning?
Shouldn't you wear gloves?
You'll have health inspectors after you.
Invention, my dear friends, is 93% perspiration...
...6% electricity...
...4% evaporation...
...and 2% butterscotch ripple.
That's one hundred and five percent!
Any good?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Time is a precious thing.
Never waste it.
- He's absolutely bonkers!
- That's not bad.
In springtime
The only pretty ring time
Birds sing
Hey, ding a ding-a-ding
Sweet lovers love...
...the spring
I told you not to, silly boy.
Your teeth!
Boy, that's great stuff.
That's exploding candy, for your enemies. Great idea.
Not ready yet.
Needs more gel ignite.
What's that for?
Gives it a little kick.
Wonka!
Butterscotch? Buttergin?
Something going on inside?
"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker. "
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?
Too cold! Far too cold.
That's gourmet cooking for you.
No! Don't, please.
Forgive me, but no one must look under there.
This is the most secret machine in my factory.
- This one's going to sizzle Slugworth.
- What's it do?
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah!
What's it do?
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.
Everlasting Gobstoppers?
For children with little pocket money.
You can suck them forever.
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!
- Me, too!
- And me!
Fantastic. Revolutionize the industry.
You suck them and they'll never get smaller. Never...
...I think.
- Few more tests.
- How do you make them?
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! Me! I do!
I can only give them to you if you swear to keep them for yourselves.
And never show them to another soul as long as you live.
Agreed?
Agreed!
Good. One for you, and one for you, and one for you.
What about Charlie?
And one for Charlie.
Hey, she's got two!
I want another!
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has one.
And one is enough for anybody.
Now, come along.
If you'll follow me...
...I have something special to show you.
It's special, all right.
I only hope Veruca doesn't want one.
What a contraption!
Isn't she scrumptious?
My revolutionary, non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.
Button, button, who's got the button?
It's over there.
- Here?
- Yeah.
What you are witnessing, dear friends...
...is the most enormous miracle of the Machine Age.
The creation of a confectionery giant!
- Finito!
- That's all?
Don't you know what this is?
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!
It's the most fabulous, sensational gum in the world!
What's so fab about it?
- This piece of gum is a 3-course dinner.
- Bull!
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.
If it's gum, that's for me.
Violet, don't do anything stupid.
What's it taste like?
Madness! It's tomato soup!
It's creamy. I can feel it running down my throat!
Stop. Don't.
Why doesn't she listen?
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.
Great soup!
The second course is coming.
Roast beef and a baked potato!
With sour cream?
- What's for dessert?
- Dessert? Here it comes!
Blueberry pie and cream! It's the most marvelous pie I've ever tasted!
- What's happening to your face?
- Cool it!
Let me finish.
You're face is turning blue!
- You're turning violet, Violet!
- What do you mean?
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.
Look what it's done to my kid!
It always goes wrong when we come to the desserts. Always.
What are you doing!
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?!
- You're like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.
- Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!
- They all become blueberries.
- You've done it this time!
I'll break you for this!
I'll get it right in the end.
Help!
We've got to let the air out of her!
There's no air.
- That's juice.
- Juice?
Would you roll her down to the juicing room?
- What for?
- For squeezing.
She has to be squeezed before she explodes.
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got another puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
Gum chewing's fine
When it's once in a while
It stops you from smoking
And brightens your smile
But it's repulsive
Revolting and wrong
Chewing and chewing
All day long
The way that a cow does
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
Given good manners
You will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do
I'll get even with you for this, if it's the last thing I do!
I got a blueberry for a daughter!
"Where is fancy bred?
In the heart or in the head?"
Shall we roll on?
Thank you.
Well, well, well!
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.
Three good, sweet little children left.
Hurry, please.
Long way to go yet.
Wait a minute.
Must show you this.
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.
Lick an orange or pineapple.
It tastes like them. Try it!
I got a plum!
Grandpa, this banana's fantastic!
It tastes so real!
Try some more. The strawberries taste like strawberries.
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?
We are the music makers.
And we are the dreamers of dreams.
Come along.
Something very unusual in here.
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere, but not a drop to drink.
Yet.
What's it making?
Fizzy-Lifting drinks. They fill you with gas and the gas lifts you...
...off the ground like a balloon.
Isn't it high?
But it's still too powerful.
Let us try some!
No, no. There'd be children floating all over the place!
Come along, don't hang about.
You'll be wild about this next one.
Let's take a drink.
No one's watching.
A small one won't hurt us.
Not bad.
Well?
Nothing's happening.
You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why!
I feel terribly strange.
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie!
- Mr. Wonka isn't going to like this!
- We can't stay up here all day!
- You're right, but...
- I'll try and get down.
All right, Charlie, but, please, be careful.
It's fun! It works!
Come on in! The air's fine!
- I haven't swam in 20 years.
- Give me your hand!
I don't think I ought to.
This is great!
Try this, Grandpa!
All right, Charlie.
Wait for me!
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!
This is really great!
Look, I'm a bird!
I feel light as a feather.
Look down.
We're really high now.
Watch this, Grandpa.
Wonderful, Charlie!
- Try it, Grandpa!
- I don't know!
Come on, Grandpa!
All right.
Hey, you did it, Grandpa!
I hit an air pocket.
You can fly to the moon this way!
Let's fly south for the winter.
Why not?
I'm a bird!
I'm a plane!
I'm...
...going too high!
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!
Help!
Grandpa, the fan!
It’ll chop us to bits!
We're in trouble!
I can't stop!
It's pulling me in!
I can't stop!
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something!
There's nothing to grab onto! Help!
We'll be killed!
Help! Help!
Mr. Wonka, please!
Turn off the fan!
I'm going down!
Burp! If you don't, it'll cut you to ribbons!
- I can't! Help!
- You've got to burp!
It's the only way!
That-a-boy! Burp again!
That-a-boy! Come on!
That's wonderful, Charlie!
Grab on.
We're going to be all right.
Good boy!
From now on we keep our feet on the ground.
Let's catch up to the others!
I know what you're thinking.
They can't be doing that.
But they are. They have to.
The Oompa Loompas can't do it.
The geese that lay the golden eggs!
They're larger than ordinary geese.
They're quadruple-size, which produce...
...octuple-size eggs.
They're laying overtime for Easter.
But Easter's over!
They don't know that.
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.
What if they drop an egg?
An omelet fit for a king, sir.
Are they chocolate eggs?
Golden chocolate eggs!
A great delicacy.
But don't get too close.
The geese are temperamental.
So we have the Eggdicator.
The Eggdicator tells the difference between a good egg...
...and a bad egg.
If it's good, it's shined and shipped over the world.
If it's a bad egg...
...down the chute.
An educated Eggdicator.
It's a lot of nonsense.
A little nonsense now and then...
...Is relished by the wisest men.
I want a golden goose!
Here we go again.
All right, sweetheart.
You'll get one as soon as we get home.
No, I want one of those!
How much do you want for the goose?
- Not for sale.
- Name your price.
She can't have one.
Who says I can't?
- The man with the hat.
- I want one!
I want a golden goose!
Gooses!
Geeses!
I want my geese to lay gold eggs for Easter.
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least 100 a day.
- Anything you say.
- And by the way!
I want a feast.
You ate before you came.
I want a bean-feast
One of those.
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts
- So good you could go nuts
- You'll have it when you get home.
No, now! I want a ball!
I want a party
Pink macaroons
And a million balloons
And performing baboons and...
...give it to me
Now!
I want the world
I want the whole world
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
Give it to me now
I want today
I want tomorrow
I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair
And I don't want to share them
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter
10,000 tons of ice cream
And if I don't get the things I am after
I'm going to scream
I want the works
I want the whole works
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises
Of all shapes and sizes
And now
Don't care how
I want it now
Don't care how
I want it now
She was a bad egg.
Where's she gone?
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.
The garbage chute!
Where does it lead to?
To the furnace.
The furnace?
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.
She could be stuck inside the tube.
Hold on!
Veruca! Sweetheart!
Daddy's coming!
There'll be a lot of garbage today.
Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.
Mr. Wonka, they won't really be burned in the furnace, will they?
I think that furnace is lit only every other day.
So they have a good sporting chance.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got another puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
Who do you blame
When your kid is a brat
Pampered and spoiled
Like a Siamese cat
Blaming the kids
Is a lie and a shame
You know exactly
Who's to blame
The mother and the father
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
If you're not spoiled
Then you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do
The children are disappearing like rabbits!
We still have each other.
Shall we press on?
Can't we sit down for a minute?
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.
Behold the Wonkamobile!
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever. "
Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.
Grab a seat, they're going fast!
What's that they're filling it up with?
Ginger ale, ginger pop, ginger beer, beer bubbles...
...bubble cola, double cola, double-bubble burp-a-cola...
...that carbonated stuff that tickles your nose.
Few people realize the power in one of those things.
I'm sorry I asked.
Would Slugworth pay extra to know about this?
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
Everybody set?
Will this go fast?
It should. It's got more gas than a politician!
Hold on. I'm going to open her up and see what she can do.
Swifter than eagles...
...stronger than lions.
It's getting in my eyes!
It's seeping in my shoes!
I'm soaked!
It’ll never come out!
It's sticking to my gun!
My dress! My hair! My face!
I'm sending you the cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka!
I'm dry cleaned!
Hey, Grandpa...
...what was that we just went through?
Hsaw Aknow.
- Is that Japanese?
- No, Wonka Wash spelled backwards.
That's it. The journey's over.
Finest bath I've had in twenty years!
Let's do it again!
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?
If the Lord meant for us to walk
He wouldn't have invented roller-skates.
Would you put these on?
We have to be careful.
There's dangerous stuff inside.
Wonkavision!
My very latest and greatest invention.
- It's television!
- It's Wonkavision.
You all know how ordinary television works.
I do! You photograph something...
...then it's split into millions of pieces...
...that fly through the air and arrive at your TV set in the right order.
You should open your mouth a little wider when you speak.
If they can do it with a photograph...
...why not a bar of chocolate?
I shall now send this chocolate bar from one end of the room to the other.
It has to be big, because when you transmit by television...
...it always ends up smaller.
Goggles on, please.
Lights... camera...
...action!
You can remove your goggles.
Where's the chocolate?
It's flying over our heads in a million pieces.
Now watch the screen.
Here it comes.
There it is.
Take it.
How? It's just a picture.
All right, you take it.
It's real!
Taste it!
It's just gotten smaller.
It's perfect!
Unbelievable!
A miracle!
A TV dinner!
It's Wonkavision.
It could change the world!
Can you send other things?
- Not just chocolate.
- Anything you like.
What about people?
People?
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.
But it might have messy results.
I'm going to be the first person to be sent by television!
Get away!
Stop. Don't. Come back.
Lights... camera... action!
Where are you?
He's up there, in a million pieces.
- Mike, are you there?
- No good shouting. Watch the screen.
Mike? Why is he taking so long?
A million pieces take time to put together.
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...
The little groover's getting smaller.
Look at me! I'm the first person in the world to be sent by television!
Wow, what a wild trip that was!
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened!
Am I coming in clear?
I said, am I coming in clear?
Great. He's completely unharmed.
You call that unharmed?!
Wow! That was something!
Can I do it again?
There'll be nothing!
Don't worry, Mom.
I feel fine.
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!
Wait till the kids hear!
No one will hear!
Where are you taking me?
I don't want to go in there!
Be quiet!
Well?
Fortunately, small boys are extremely springy and elastic.
So, I think we'll put him in my special taffy-pulling machine.
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.
The boy is in his mother's purse.
But be careful.
What's he saying?
No, I won't hold you responsible.
And now, my dearest lady, it's time to say good-bye.
No, no! Don't speak!
For some moments in life, there are no words. Run along now.
Adieu.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow. "
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do
I've got another puzzle for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
What do you get from a glut of TV?
A pain in the neck and an IQ of 3
Why don't you try simply reading a book?
Or could you just not bear to look?
You'll get no
You'll get no commercials
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da
If you like reading you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the...
...Oompa...
...Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do!
So much to do, so much to do.
Invoices, bills, letters.
I must answer that note from the queen.
What will happen to the others?
My dear boy...
...they'll be quite all right.
When they leave here they'll be restored to their normal, terrible old selves.
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.
Don't worry.
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.
Up the stairs. I'm busy.
A whole day wasted.
Good-bye to you both.
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?
I don't know, Charlie.
But I'm going to find out.
I am extraordinarily busy, sir.
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.
When does he get it?
- He doesn't.
- Why not?
Because he broke the rules.
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?
Wrong, sir! Wrong!
Under Section 37-B of the contract signed by him...
...it states clearly that all offers shall become null and void if...
...and you can read it for yourself in this copy:
"I, the undersigned...
"... shall forfeit all rights, privileges and licenses...
"... herein contained," et cetera...
"... fax mentis...
"... incendium gloria culpam," et cetera, et cetera.
"Memo bis punitor della cattum!"
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as crystal!
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!
You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be sterilized!
So you get nothing!
You lose!
Good day, sir!
You're a crook!
A cheat and a swindler, that's what you are!
How can you do this?!
Build up a little boy's hopes and then smash his dreams to pieces!
You're an inhuman monster!
I said, "Good day"!
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.
I'll get even, if it's the last thing I do.
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper, he'll get one.
"So shines a good deed...
"... in a weary world. "
My boy.
You've won!
You did it! You did it!
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!
Forgive me for putting you through this.
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.
And you passed the test.
You won!
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?
The chocolate, yes.
But, that's just the beginning!
We have so much time and so little to do!
Strike that. Reverse it.
This way, please!
We'll take the Wonkavator.
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.
A Wonkavator.
An elevator goes up and down.
But the Wonkavator goes sideways, slantways, backways...
And frontways?
...and any ways you can think of.
It can take you to any room by pressing one of these buttons. Any button.
Press a button and zing!
You're off.
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.
Except one.
This one.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Me?
There it goes!
Hold on tight!
I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen.
Faster! If we don't pick up speed, we won't get through.
Through what?
- You mean, we're going..?
- Up and out.
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1,000 pieces!
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.
Hold on, everybody!
Here it comes!
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.
Our town looks so pretty.
Look over here, Charlie.
I think I see our house.
It really looks beautiful.
There's my school!
How did you like the chocolate factory?
It's the most wonderful place in the world.
I'm pleased to hear you say that...
...because I'm giving it to you.
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?
- You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.
And I don't really want to try.
Who can I trust to run the factory, and take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?
Not a grown-up.
A grown-up would do everything his way, not mine.
That's why I decided long ago that I had to find a child.
A very honest...
...loving child...
...to whom I can tell all my precious candy-making secrets.
- That's why you sent the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.
- And me?
- Absolutely.
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.
I want you to bring them all.
But Charlie...
...don't forget what happened to the man who got everything he wanted.
What happened?
He lived happily ever after.
A beggar woman.
- Mad?
- Yes.
Ah yes. I remember.
She follows the rivers.
Comes from Burma.
Not Indian.
She comes from Savannakhet.
Born there.
Walking...
For ten years.
And one day, in front of her, the Ganges.
- Yes.
- She stays.
That's right.
12 children dead while she walked towards Bengal?
Yes.
She leaves them.
Sells them, forgets them.
On the way to Bengal, she goes barren
- Savannakhet, Laos?
- Yes.
At seventeen.
Pregnant... seventeen...
...thrown out by her mother, goes away...
...asks the way to get lost.
No one knows.
In Calcutta they were together.
- She and the white woman?
- Yes.
During the same years...
- He had followed her to India.
- Yes.
For her, he left everything.
Overnight.
- The night of the ball?
- yes.
Michael Richardson was engaged to a girl from S. Thala,
Lola Valerie Stein.
They were to marry in the autumn.
Then, the ball,
The ball at S. Thala.
She arrived late...
...in the middle of the night...
...in black.
That ball, such love... such desire.
That light?
The monsoon.
That dust?
Central Calcutta.
What is that scent of flowers?
Leprosy.
Where are we?
The French Embassy, in India.
- That murmur?
- The Ganges.
When she died, he left India?
Yes.
Her grave is in the English cemetery?
Yes.
- She died out there?
- On the islands.
Found dead one night.
A black Lancia...
...speeds along the road to Chandernagore.
It was there that she first tried?
Yes.
What are you afraid of?
Anne-Marie Stretter.
They would dance in the evening
They're dancing.
What are you crying about?
I love you...
...to the point of not seeing...
...not hearing...
...dying.
Lepers burst like sacks of dust, you know.
- Don't suffer?
- No, feel nothing.
She's there by the Ganges, under the trees.
She has forgotten.
- The French Vice-Consul from Lahore.
- Yes.
Sent to Calcutta in disgrace.
He's come back to the grounds?
Yes.
He comes every night.
The tennis court, deserted.
Anne-Marie Stretter's red bicycle.
Where is the one in black?
Out driving.
She comes back with the night.
The black Lancia has just entered the grounds.
She hunts at night in the depths of the Ganges.
For food.
Dead on the islands
- Her eyes pierced with light, dead.
- Yes.
Beneath that stone.
Around her, a bend in the Ganges...
Four o'clock.
Darkest night.
- No one's asleep?
- No one.
What heat!
Impossible.
Terrible.
Another storm...
...coming to Bengal...
...coming from the islands.
From the estuaries, inexhaustible...
- What's that sound?
- Her, crying.
- She isn't suffering, is she?
- No.
Leprosy.
Leprosy of the heart.
- Can't bear it?
- No, can't bear it.
India, can't bear it.
She's sleeping.
He loved her more than anything in the world.
More than that.
Michael Richardson set up a marine insurance business...
...in Bengal, to stay with her in India.
Listen...
The Ganges fishermen.
What a night!
What heat!
All-embracing...
Deathly...
From behind the plants in the bar she watches them.
Only at dawn...
...when the lovers went toward the door of the ballroom...
...did Lola Val脠rie Stein utter a cry.
Didn't hear anything else.
Didn't see anything else.
This crime in her past.
Yes.
Rain.
Yes.
Cool.
Her music, that was Venice.
A promising artist.
- Never gave up playing?
- Never.
Ana Maria Guardi.
Yes.
The first marriage?
- The first post?
- Savannakhet, Laos.
To a French colonial civil servant.
She's 18.
Oh yes, a river...
...already...
...she's sitting by a river, and she's looking.
The Mekong.
- She's silent? Crying?
- Yes.
They say:
"She won't get used to it".
"She'll have to be sent back to Europe. "
- She couldn't bear it, already?
- Already.
Caught behind gates.
The government house grounds
- Those sentries?
- The guard.
- Already couldn't bear it.
- No.
One day, a government launch stops...
...Monsieur Stretter is inspecting the Mekong posts.
- Takes her away to Savannakhet?
- Yes, takes her with him.
For 17 years, through the capitals of Asia.
You find her in Peking, again in Mandalay.
In Bangkok... you find her in Bangkok.
In Rangoon...
In Sydney.
You find her in Lahore...
17 years.
She's in Calcutta...
Calcutta...
She dies.
- Who's the other man?
- A friend passing through.
A friend of Stretter.
Whoever wants her, has her.
He gives her.
- Love.
- Yes.
Splendor.
"Anne-Marie Stretter" written on the grave?
"Ana Maria Guardi", but worn away.
Every night...
...looks at her.
- Has never spoken to her?
- Never.
Never approached any woman.
- The male virgin of Lahore.
- Yes.
- Those gleams over there?
- The burning ghats.
Burning those who died of hunger?
Yes.
It's dawn.
He had fired a gun in Lahore.
One night, from his balcony, he fired on the lepers of the Shalimar Gardens.
- Couldn't bear it?
- No.
- India, couldn't bear it?
- No.
What about India?
The idea.
There was a reception at the French embassy?
Yes.
The park stretches down to the Ganges.
The offices are on this side.
You see? Those grey buildings.
Farther away, the tennis courts, deserted during the monsoon.
Almost no one is dancing?
In this heat, how could you?
The only remedy, immobility.
Slowness...
Slow down the blood.
The smell of mud.
Insipid.
The Ganges, low tide.
The new Austrian attach脠.
Been here a month.
- He can't get used to India.
- His first time here?
Yes.
He'll come again.
- He'll go to the islands.
- How can you tell?
The anguish in his eyes.
She can't bear people who get used to India.
The Ambassador asks people to the islands for his wife.
She goes alone to the islands.
The Ambassador goes hunting in Nepal.
They say her lovers are English, don't mix with the embassies, and that the Ambassador knows.
A friend of the Stretters'.
Unknown in Calcutta.
With this humidity the pianos are detuned.
The French Vice-Consul has just entered the park.
At the last minute she sent him a card: "Come".
Just what did he do?
The worst... killed.
- In Lahore.
- The official version?
Nerves gave way.
Often happens.
- Easy to say.
- Yes.
His face... as if grafted.
Very pale.
She could have spared us his presence.
An outcast in Lahore too?
There too.
He just escaped being dismissed.
The ambassador intervened.
Closed circles in India make me think of leprosy.
- Perhaps he drank? - No. Drunkenness is the same for us all here.
We talk about going home.
No, he didn't drink.
The Ambassador asked the young attach脠 to have a word with him.
He tries.
He turns away.
Can't bear it.
Any of it.
He laughs.
As if he were suddenly mad with joy.
Look...
Perhaps he's just seen
Madame Stretter... perhaps.
- You mean...
- I wonder... perhaps.
Did he talk about Lahore?
Only to her.
Near dawn.
He fired at night, on the Shalimar Gardens...
...on lepers, dogs.
But they found bullets in the mirrors in his house in Lahore, too.
Shooting at himself...
Roses arrived every day from Nepal.
She gave them out at the end of the ball.
After lunch, people sink...
Heavy sleep.
Yet everyone waits for something like that.
Storms are expected.
Just a hole in the sky.
It fills in straight away.
How white she is!
How white they are, the women of Calcutta!
For six months, out only in the evening
Fleeing the sun.
Seems imprisoned in a kind of suffering.
No one really knows what goes on behind these walls.
What she does.
Cycling very early in the morning, in the grounds.
Playing tennis,
She reads, they say.
Parcels of books come from Venice for her.
She goes to the islands.
Appearances...
Only one person sees him.
The director of the European club.
A drunkard.
All he said to the director was repeated to the Ambassador.
- It's horrid!
- You don't understand.
He knew it would be repeated.
That's why he spoke to the director.
A way to reach her, this woman.
He said he was entitled to Madame Stretter's attentions, to her love, as much as the others...
Her lovers from Calcutta...
At night, near the tennis courts...
...this bicycle...
He says:
"A thing she had touched".
No...
...that can't be repeated.
Of this passion, she said nothing.
Nothing.
He said he regretted not making a convincing report of Lahore.
Convincing?
I remember the word.
- What's known of his background?
- Lived in Neuilly.
Father worked in a bank.
Mother left the father, then died.
Expelled from various schools...
At 15, a disciplinary school.
An aunt writes sometimes.
Look at his eyes.
He's crying.
He seems unaware of it.
He seems to be in a state... of tears.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
What about?
Your next post.
The voice is toneless, as if he was trying not to shout.
You can't get used to it either?
No. the heat, of course...
...but also the monotony.
The light...
...no colour.
But you... before Lahore...
...would you have preferred something else?
No.
Lahore was what I wanted.
Come to the bar.
What are you afraid of?
They say you'd like Bombay.
I wish to stay in Calcutta.
I don't think that's possible.
Then leave it to the Consular Service.
They can send me where they like.
Bombay is less crowded.
The climate is better.
The nearness of the sea is an advantage.
I haven't asked to see my file.
What does it say?
That Lahore...
...what you did in Lahore...
People can't understand.
No matter how hard they try.
No one.
No one?
What are you doing?
Come along.
I'm listening to "India Song".
I came to India because of "India Song".
That tune makes me want to love.
I have never loved.
I had never loved anyone.
He saw himself photographed, in a rocking chair by the Gulf of Oman.
Then, one morning...
...on the way to his office, he saw her in the park...
...by the tennis courts...
...in white.
What a story!
What passion!
He left everything for her.
Some close friends stayed after the reception.
The passion sometimes...
Those European suicides that increase with the hunger that they never suffer...
In its internal law, that culpability of the West...
It is absurd, clear.
Shanghai... Did you see the photos of the bombing?
The first attempt in Savannakhet...
...because of a dead body, abandoned by its mother, a beggar from the north, in the government house grounds...
...outside her room...
No woman in Lahore knew him enough...
...to shed any light on...
- No woman.
- How terrible!
No one has ever visited him in Lahore.
That's how he wanted to be, a virgin alone, waiting for love.
Death all around you, never quite reaching you.
What are you talking about?
The Vice-Consul who is looking for Madame Stretter.
She has been leaving receptions more and more often.
It was bound to happen.
Look...
He is going over to
Madame Stretter.
Did you see?
How subtle!
How cleverly he saved his wife...
- Where are they going?
- Into the second drawing room.
Sooner or later the Ambassador had to talk with him.
So you see...
He's asked for champagne.
If I've got it right, you'd like Bombay?
But in Bombay you couldn't have the same job as Lahore.
It's still too soon.
If you stay here for a while, people will forget.
Or I can keep you in Calcutta.
Yes.
A strange thing, a career.
If you forget Lahore, so will others.
I won't forget Lahore.
There are remedies...
...for this sort of nervousness, as it is called.
- You know.
- No!
At the beginning, everyone, myself included...
...we feel the same.
It's a question of finding, inventing...
...a way of looking at things.
I haven't.
I see nothing.
Go back to Paris.
No...
It's impossible.
The Mekong, at Savannakhet, flowing yellow between forest and rice fields.
In those days the launches were slow.
It took days...
At sunset, the mosquitoes...
We couldn't see a thing.
Black clusters on the netting.
The Ambassador wrote poetry.
- It's said she discouraged it.
- The banks can't be seen when it rains.
The sky is low.
The water, muddy.
When he met her, she was so young, and he, already...
They're great friends.
He took her away from Savannakhet?
No one knows.
She courted death in Savannakhet.
So young.
You must come with us to the islands.
The Embassy villa was built a long time ago.
It's worth seeing.
And also the islands of the delta.
I'd be pleased to come.
Perhaps what she did was music...
...behind those walls.
Prisoner of that suffering, so old.
Painless.
A leprosy of the heart.
Yet sometimes, in the grounds, those tears...
The light of the monsoon...
...so harsh...
...and her eyes so clear that tears...
Tell me about her.
Irreproachable.
Here that means...
...nothing that you can see.
After Venice, she gave no more concerts?
No, never.
Have they met?
They must have seen each other in the grounds.
What is he looking at?
Madame Stretter, dancing with the young attach脠.
Listen carefully, to her voice, the accent.
Perhaps that's what makes her seem distant.
- That origin.
- Yes, maybe that too...
I wish I were you...
...arriving here for the first time, with the rains.
You aren't bored?
What do you do in the evenings?
On Sundays?
I read, sleep.
I don't really know.
Boredom, of course, is so personal.
It's hard to give advice.
I don't think I'm bored.
Then again, it may not be as serious as they say.
Thank you for sending the parcels of books up so promptly.
A pleasure.
You know, one could say almost nothing is possible in India.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
That this general despondency...
It's neither painful nor pleasant to live in India.
Neither easy nor difficult.
It's nothing.
You see?
Nothing.
You mean it's impossible?
Well... perhaps, yes.
But then, you know it's probably an over-simplification.
The Vice-Consul is looking at you.
He's been doing so all evening.
You didn't notice?
Where is he hoping to be posted?
Here in Calcutta.
Really?
I thought you knew already.
They say you're Venetian.
My father was French.
My mother was from Venice.
I kept her name.
At first, I would have said English.
That happens.
Are there any who never get used to it?
Almost everyone does.
Did my husband mention the islands?
I'd be pleased to come.
You write, I believe?
I once thought I could.
Did someone tell you?
Yes. But I would have guessed.
Your way of being silent.
I gave it up.
Monsieur Stretter used to write?
He used to, yes. He too, and then...
And you?
I never tried.
You think it's not worth it, don't you?
Well... Yes, if you like.
You play music?
Sometimes.
Less, in the last few years.
Why?
Hard to put into words.
Tell me.
A sort of pain is linked to music...
...for some time now, for me.
In Venice, already, very young,
18 years old, music, to the point of madness.
Until a sort of suicide, already.
She says she no longer knows how to play.
What's happening?
The Vice-Consul is dancing with the Spanish ambassador's wife.
He's talking of leprosy.
Will you have to dance with him?
I don't have to do anything, but...
He was here last night...
...near the tennis courts.
He sleeps badly.
- She broke away from him...
- What happened?
Something he said, must have frightened her.
What do people fear?
Repulsion is a feeling you know nothing about.
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Horror...
Come to the bar.
I'm an old friend of Madame Stretter.
We've not met.
George Crown.
Help yourselves.
There's no one at the bar.
- His words are a diversion.
- Ready to flee.
And yet...
He's still looking at you.
Seems she doesn't dare go out in the park.
What is he talking about with that man from the club?
Childhood. And her, the French Ambassador's wife.
Why is he waiting to leave?
To be thrown out, probably.
- The mad beggar woman.
- The one who laughs.
It is said she's from Laos
It doesn't seem possible...
- A beggar woman is in the grounds.
- I Know.
The one who sings.
Don't you know her?
But no, you're new to Calcutta.
She sings, I believe, a song from Savannakhet.
In Laos.
She intrigues us.
I keep thinking it can't be possible.
We're thousands of miles from Indochina.
How could she?
I've heard her in the avenue, early in the morning.
It's a happy song.
Children sing it over there.
She must have come down the river valleys.
But how did she manage to cross the Cardamoms?
She's completely mad.
Yes. But she's alive
She comes to the islands sometimes.
How?
No one knows.
Perhaps she follows you.
Follows the whites.
That happens. For food.
- Where is he?
- By the bar.
Drinks too much.
It'll end badly.
We could see him at night through the window of his room.
Pacing...
Pacing, day and night.
Day and night.
He'd call down death on Lahore.
And fire.
He shouted too.
Disconnected words.
And laughed.
Isn't there in each of us a chance, just one...
...of being like him in Lahore?
But one knows about leprosy before coming. One knows.
Perhaps he thought the gardens were empty. In that light...
...that fog...
Look at the sky... sick.
That thickness... that dirt, throughout the night.
He said he wanted leprosy.
He is anger itself.
Against whom?
Against what?
Doesn't need a reason.
They're dancing.
Look.
She's always loved dancing.
Some months ago, in Chandernagore, they were found in a cheap hotel.
Trying to die together.
Hard to believe.
An ambulance back to Calcutta.
The truth came out in the end.
For no reason, they say.
"Indifference to life".
Or the opposite.
People confuse things.
No. There's a definite equivalence.
The same appearances.
People always talked about her...
...a great deal.
About that love.
And the islands.
The delta islands.
That's all they'll miss of India.
What would they have done without them?
About heat.
About fear.
Leprosy, and hunger.
About the Vice-Consul from Lahore...
...those dead...
About that sweetness...
We wondered:
All those books...
...those sleepless nights in the delta.
Those tears?
India Song...
On his way to the office, he whistled India Song.
He said to the club director:
"At home in Neuilly, in the drawing room, there's a black piano. "
"India Song is on the music-rest. "
"My mother played it. "
"The score has been there since she died. "
Day already.
No one speaks.
They seem to be waiting.
The tennis courts were deserted.
A bicycle was there.
I noticed they were deserted, after she'd gone.
The air was torn apart.
Her skirt, against the trees.
She looked at me.
I didn't know you existed.
Calcutta has become a form of hope for me.
I love Michael Richardson.
I'm not free of that love.
I know.
I love you like that, in that love.
It doesn't matter.
I sound odd.
Do you hear my voice?
It frightens them.
Yes.
Who is she?
I shot myself in Laos, but didn't die.
The others separate me from Lahore.
I don't.
Lahore is me.
You understand too?
Yes. Don't shout.
Yes.
You are with me, with Lahore.
I know it.
You are in me.
I'll take you away inside me.
We shall fire on the Shalimar lepers.
You can't avoid it.
I didn't need to dance with you to know you.
And you know it.
I know it.
There's no need for us to go on.
We have nothing to say to each other.
We are the same.
I believe that.
Have love affairs with others.
We don't need that.
I wanted to know the smell of your hair.
That explains why I...
After the reception, your friends will stay on.
I wish I could stay with you once.
There's no chance.
They'd throw me out.
Yes. You are someone they have to forget.
Like Lahore.
Yes.
What will become of me?
You'll be posted far from Calcutta.
That's what you want?
Yes.
Very well.
When will it end?
With your death, I believe.
What's this pain?
My pain?
Intelligence.
About you?
I'll ask them to let me stay tonight.
Do what you like.
To make something happen between you and me.
A public incident.
All I know how to do is shout.
Let them know love can be shouted.
They'll be uncomfortable.
Then start talking again.
I even know you'll tell no one you agreed.
Let me stay!
I'm going to stay here tonight! With her!
Just once, with her!
Do you hear?
- What is it?
- Better do something.
How terrible.
Bound to happen.
I'm staying!
I'm going to stay in the French Embassy!
I'm going to the islands with her!
I beg you!
I beg you!
Let me stay!
- Dreadful!
- It's terrible.
And she just stands still.
Once!
Just once!
I've never loved anyone but her!
Do go home.
You've had too much to drink.
He did it deliberately.
No sense of...
What happened?
How strange.
Indecent.
Impossible to understand.
It's terrible.
How dreadful!
They've got him.
He's not resisting.
He's outside. Locked out.
Laughing and crying.
Did you see?
He's forcing the gate.
The beggars are afraid.
He's gone.
- Now all is clear.
- What?
Lahore.
He's still shouting.
Where is she?
- In the drawing room.
- With him.
In a way, everyone should cry.
- Don't you think?
- But...
It's a manner of speaking.
Is that the Vice-Consul of France shouting?
Yes.
Still shouting.
After the trip to the islands, he drops out of sight.
He tenders his resignation.
The file ends with his resignation.
Soon after?
A few days.
What's he saying?
Her Venetian name in deserted Calcutta.
The whole night he shouted that name.
That sound of wings, of birds?
Day.
Sunrise, here.
There... and beyond.
The air smells of mud.
And leprosy.
And fire.
- Not a breath of air?
- No.
Only very small movements...
...very slow wafts...
...of odour.
The sun.
What light!
Awful!
Yes.
Exile.
She's listless.
Yes.
Deeply absent.
The heat is rust-coloured.
Above, smoke.
The factories.
This continent, suspended?
The monsoon.
Below, Bengal.
Further.
Lower.
Beneath the sky.
Look...
In a bend of the Ganges.
That whiteness.
Over there.
The English cemetery.
A car is speeding along the straight roads, by the Ganges.
They've left for the islands.
- Those junks?
- Rice.
On the slopes, those dark patches?
People.
The highest density in the world.
- Those dark mirrors, thousands of them?
- The rice fields of India.
The black Lancia has stopped.
The rain.
The roads are flooded.
They took shelter in a sala.
There, the young attach脠 said:
"I saw the Vice-Consul before I left".
He was still shouting in the streets.
He asked if I was going to the islands.
I said I was going to Nepal with the Ambassador.
Did she approve of the lie?
She hardly ever mentioned the man from Lahore.
That green colour.
It's growing larger.
The ocean.
The islands.
Which one is it?
The largest.
The central island.
They've arrived.
That white palace?
The Prince of Wales, an international hotel.
The sea is rough.
There's been a storm.
In front, the piers.
Those ships sail the South Pacific.
Behind, berths for yachts.
Through the trees, the same flat horizon.
The islands are alluvial.
The mud of the Ganges.
Where's the French Embassy villa?
Beyond the hotel, facing the ocean.
She wanted to swim when she arrived?
Yes.
It was late,
The sea rough.
It was impossible to swim,
Just let the warm waves break over her.
She bathed with him.
Those nets everywhere in the sea?
Against the delta sharks.
Where is she?
She'll come.
She's coming.
- That evening, was she the same?
- Smiling.
Dressed in white.
Who comes to the hotel?
White India.
I can't quite remember.
Didn't she go to the
Embassy villa?
She only slept there.
She dined at the Prince of Wales, when she went to the islands.
She had the villa's servants sent back to Calcutta.
- How long ago?
- A few weeks.
- India Song.
- Yes.
- There's dancing in the lounge.
- Tourists from Ceylon.
These birds?
Prisoners of the island, because of the storm.
They're in the mango trees.
They strip them.
They'll fly at dawn.
This sudden smell of death?
Incense.
He had come on the last boat?
Yes, the 7 o'clock boat.
He hadn't been home all day.
He never went back to Calcutta.
When the mist came, the wind dropped.
She had the blinds raised.
She wants to see the ocean, the sky above the estuaries.
They are very tired, after last night.
She is looking outside.
I remember...
...a wall of mist comes in toward the islands.
Yes.
She says something about Venice.
Venice in the winter.
Yes, that's right.
- Venice?
- Yes.
Perhaps certain winter evenings, in Venice, the same mist.
She's saying the name of a colour.
Violet.
The colour of the delta mist.
It was a September evening...
...during the summer monsoon...
...on the islands...
...in 1937.
In China, the war went on.
Shanghai had just been bombed.
The Japanese were still advancing.
In Spain, they were still fighting.
The Republic is strangled.
In Russia, the Revolution is betrayed.
The Congress of Nuremberg had just taken place.
Already, the beggar woman was hunting in the warm waters of the delta.
Michael Richardson and the young guest had gone across the beach to the villa.
The other two had gone sailing.
She had wanted to go back alone, along the inland paths.
Behind her, the Vice-Consul of Lahore.
He followed her to the park.
Michael Richardson and the young guest had arrived after her.
She had gone to meet them in the park.
They move toward one another.
They meet.
They seem to be talking.
They go toward the villa.
Once they had tried...
...tried to die together.
Without succeeding.
In a brothel, in Chandernagore.
They'd been discovered.
At one point in the night, she brings them champagne.
Glasses.
She serves them.
It's still night when Michael Richardson takes away the young guest.
Tears himself away from that place.
Leaves her there.
Later, music was heard around the Embassy villa.
The lovers of the Ganges had promised to let each other be free, if ever either of them decided to die.
The young guest came back to the villa during the night.
Yes.
He saw her.
She was lying in the park, leaning on one elbow.
He said:
"She stretched out her arm and put her head on it. "
"The Vice-Consul of Lahore was ten yards away. "
They didn't speak to each other. "
She must have stayed there a long time. Till daylight.
Then she must have taken the path.
On the beach they found the dressing gown.
And the heat was once more the heat of Calcutta.
