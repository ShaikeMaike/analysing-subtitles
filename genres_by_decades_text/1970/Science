Cough.
This hurt?
This? This?
Oh, that's all right now, Sarah.
I guess I've poked and pushed at you enough.
Come on in, now.
You get yourself dressed, then come on in here.
Then we'll have a little talk.
Oh, Sarah, I haven't seen you for quite some time.
You know how it is, Dr Thomas.
Frank and the children have been going to the new doctor.
You've been going to him, too?
Oh, no. No. I told Frank, "Dr Thomas has always been the Kane family doctor,
"and I'm still right satisfied with that arrangement."
Thank you, Sarah.
Well, I do wish you had been seeing someone, though.
You must have been suffering considerable pain.
Some.
You raised a fine family, Sarah.
Fine. Just fine.
Oh, you heard from your brother John lately?
No. Just a card last Christmas.
It's been seven years.
Well, now, what are we going to do about you, Sarah?
Let's see.
I think you better see Miss Fanny Jeffers, and tell her you're not coming in to work tomorrow.
I want to put you in the Memorial Hospital this afternoon just for some tests.
You see, I want to give you some tests to find out what's causing all that pain.
Nothing to get upset about now.
Just some tests.
-Lloyd?
-Oh, how do, Reverend MacGill?
-Evening, Mr Thomas.
-Come in. Come on in, boy.
Papa, have you got a minute?
I want to talk to you.
-That's why I asked you to come by.
-You asked me?
Yes. I called your office.
Well, I didn't get it.
I'm going straight to Hill-Donaldson.
-Any trouble there?
-No. No, nothing much.
Seems to me like you ought to get that strike settled.
Why don't you get Perry Kermit out on the golf course and tell him to give those men the extra $1 and get it over with?
Oh, Papa, you just don't understand.
They recognise this union and then they got trouble in Birmingham and Gary and...
Well, look, I didn't come here to talk politics. What is it you want?
I already told Reverend MacGill part.
It concerns one of my patients,
Sarah Gabriel.
You know, works for Miss Fanny Jeffers.
-Oh, yeah.
-It's a tumour, malignant.
She's got maybe a few more days to live at most.
Poor sister. A true Christian.
But what's troubling me started
35 years back.
Thirty-five years. Oh, Papa.
A delivery, Aunt Ella Kane, Sarah's mother.
I was troubled about a breach presentation.
So I brought her in here at the office.
A sudden storm, considerable wind damage.
But there was a sudden surge, and the main transformer on the relay line at Marion Road just blew.
Well, I just finished cutting the umbilical cord when the lights came back on again.
John. Seven pounds, three ounces.
Well, he grew up like any other little coloured boy in town.
Measles and chicken pox and all that.
Then, when he was about halfway through high school, he quit.
Now, there wasn't anything too unusual about that. Not in those times and other, but at the age of 16, he just disappeared.
-What do you mean?
-He left town.
Papa, lots of coloured boys left town.
There wasn't anything to wonder about then.
There was no trouble at home or with the police.
Then it was...
Oh, yeah, seven or eight years went by.
Then Aunt Ella Kane had a sudden stroke.
I didn't like the signs, so I put her into the hospital for observation.
That afternoon,
Sarah's brother, John, dropped off the Trailways bus from Marion.
Few hours later,
Aunt Ella had a sudden embolism and died.
The next day after the funeral, he left town.
Is that it? I mean, this boy showing up at his mother's deathbed?
If you'll indulge your father for a few minutes further.
It was again years and years went by.
How many, Papa? I got an appointment.
Then Sarah, Aunt Ella's daughter, came to me.
The father, been a brick mason, travelled from job to job.
There'd been an accident in a five-storey business block in a small town in lndiana,
Columbus or Frankfurt. Lafayette.
Anyway, the man died in the fall.
But there was a small insurance policy, and Sarah asked me to see if the lndiana authorities signed certain papers.
So, I was going to a Bloomington medical conference anyway, so I stopped off at Columbus.
It was Columbus.
Everything had been taken care of.
The man's son had arrived a few minutes after the accident and was with his father when he died.
That boy John, wandering God knows where, had come back to his mother's deathbed and his father's deathbed.
And now his sister Sarah was in the hospital.
Not a soul in the world who knows she has just a few days maybe to live at most.
And yet as sure as I am standing here
I feel that boy will come back to his sister's deathbed.
Papa, there are holes in that story you could drive a truck through.
He could have found out in a perfectly ordinary kind of way.
A long-distance telephone call, telegram.
-No one knows where he is.
-But you don't know that for sure.
The family doesn't know that she's dying.
I was just talking to Reverend MacGill about how to break the news to the family.
That's the very important thing you had to tell me? I mean, that's it?
You'll excuse me, Reverend,
I have to get along.
-Papa, could I see you?
-Yeah.
-Yeah, can I see you, Papa?
-Excuse me, Reverend.
I swear,
I don't know what's the matter with you.
-I'm sorry, Lloyd.
-I tell you... Well, no, I don't have time now,
-but I got something to tell you. Papa...
-Hi, Harry, Peter.
Papa, would you listen to me?
George Howard was talking to me about your driving again.
And look, you put another dent in your fender.
It cost me $48 to straighten out two weeks ago.
Well, I'll take care of it in the insurance.
Papa, they have cancelled your insurance after the last accident.
I'm carrying you as an assigned risk.
What's the use?
Papa, would you just take care?
Drive careful.
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
Where the hell have you been?
-Union wages!
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
Well, I came right out here.
We've got a court order, no mass picketing.
-Now, are you going to...
-Orly Ball's coming right out.
-Are you going to enforce that injunction?
-Now, just take it easy, Archie.
Then we sure elected ourselves one hell of a county solicitor.
Now, wait just a damn minute.
You didn't elect anybody.
You're sure as hell gonna find out in the next primary.
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
If you think you can get along in this county without the company...
Now, look here...
Perry, Perry, would you let me talk to Orly?
What do we want?
Now, there's a court order.
Twelve pickets at the main gate.
We got a call from the New York office, and they say they heard there was a field representative coming down here from the Southern Labour Rights Council.
Now, you know damn well...
When somebody crosses the line into Calawah County to incite violence
I'll take care of him. Now, in the meantime,
I'm going to keep the peace.
Hey, Bill, old Sheriff Orly Ball's coming over here. Now, you keep them going, but keep them down low. Keep them going.
-Union wages! Right now!
-Union wages! Right now!
-Hey, Charley Gray.
-Hey, Sheriff.
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
You're gonna have to ask your boys to kind of thin themselves out a bit.
-When do we want it?
-Right now.
They don't always do what I tell them to, Sheriff.
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
On the other hand, what the hell good is it going to do us, getting heads busted at this stage of the game, huh?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-Union wages!
Look, you're entitled to have 12 pickets.
That's legal, right?
Now, it don't make no nevermind to me if the rest of them watch them right out there.
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
-What do we want?
-Union wages right now!
-Union wages right now!
It wouldn't be a bad place to watch from, Sheriff.
-When do we want it?
-Right now!
Nice talking to you, Charley Gray.
Hey, it's always a pleasure, Sheriff.
-Union wages!
-When do we want it?
And he ordered adrenaline lM on top of the oxygen, but she didn't respond.
So he called Dr Rhorbach, because he didn't want to take the responsibility without a senior head of service.
I'm sorry, Mr Gabriel.
I did think that she would have more time.
I told her time and time again to stop dosing herself with that damn pink medicine.
I don't think that would have made much difference.
-Did Sarah have any other kinfolk in town?
-Just let it all out, honey.
-No.
-Her brother, John.
I guess you'll want to get in touch with him if anybody knows where he is.
Sit down, Frank, sit down.
You'll have to sign for the PM, Doctor.
John.
John Kane.
Dr Thomas.
I didn't know if you'd remember me.
I didn't think anyone knew where to reach you.
I suppose they didn't.
I was just passing through.
You saw Sarah? I mean, before she died?
It must have been a comfort to her, although I don't think she knew.
I think maybe she guessed.
Were you far away?
How long will you be staying in town?
Just a little while.
Excuse me.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord, forever.
Amen.
Who's that, Doc?
Oh, John.
John Kane.
Sarah's brother.
Why?
I just take a kindly interest in all strangers in town these days.
Even at funerals?
Oh, hell, Doc.
I'm sitting on a goddamn powder keg out there at Hill-Donaldson.
All I need is some outsider coming in to blow it up.
Are you expecting one?
So I hear. When did he come to town?
John Kane is no outsider.
He was born and raised right here.
Well, then where's he been, Doc?
That's what I always want to know.
Now, try some of Sister Addy's rice here, and this is some of Sister Georgette Dexter's melon relish.
Now, you come back for some more ribs, you hear?
Hey, Louisa, let me have some...
-Henry, get off me!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
John, come on back here and have a drink with the boys.
Oh, listen,
I'm sorry about your sister, Sarah, but when you get through with all them condolences, you come back here and have some fun with us, all right?
You just trying to make me do all the work, and you're not doing nothing.
-I do everything.
-You know Papa's not feeling well.
Let's don't start an argument, okay?
This is my niece, Louisa.
Louisa, this is Miss Sarah's brother, John.
-Oh, good evening, Reverend.
-Welcome, Doctor.
Thank you.
Can I fix you a cup of coffee, Doctor?
A little plate?
Well, I would appreciate a cup of coffee,
Miss Dunbar. Thank you.
-All right.
-Frank, I just can't tell you how sorry I am.
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You, too, Jimmy.
Marsha Jean,
I know your mother had every confidence that you two would grow up to be the kind of people that would make things happen.
Now, I've got the two plates now.
Mr Thomas, I believe it's this John Kane.
Yeah, but... Look, it is my job to find out who he is.
Well, I don't want to say right out.
Just a minute.
Do you want to move back there like I said?
I just don't want no trouble, Sheriff.
I told you, just move back there.
You told me to look out for somebody moving on Hill-Donaldson, right?
Look, I ain't gonna take the responsibility,
Mr Thomas.
You just come out here like I say.
-Henry, I have to wash up the dishes.
-No, you don't!
What's the matter with you? Come now.
Come on!
Hey, talk to me. Ask me something.
-What?
-Anything.
You still play shortstop rougher than any boy in town?
I haven't played recently.
I didn't think you'd remember me that well.
Yes. You were a good deal smaller and not much account back then, but I remember.
-It's all right now. Thanks.
-What is?
Henry Birkhardt. He owns a GMC dump truck and a Pontiac Judge, and he can't understand why I don't find him irresistible.
-You don't?
-No. I...
To hell with him.
Why'd you come back here?
My sister died. Why did you come back?
How do you know I was away?
Was it Chicago? San Francisco?
-New York.
-What were you doing there?
I was a teacher.
And until the city and the schools fell apart,
I provided a broadening cultural experience for upper middle-class children.
But that city is so uptight, like it's choking to death.
It doesn't work any more. None of them do.
At least not for me.
You know what I mean?
Why am I telling you all this?
Maybe you want to interest me.
Why would I want to interest you?
Well, for one thing,
I don't own a GMC dump truck.
I'll buy that.
What about you, Brother John?
What have you been doing?
Working.
It's finished now.
I'm going to cool it for a few days before I split.
-You teaching here?
-Stuart Street.
-I went to grade school there.
-Yes. I know.
You carved your name over the toilet.
Yes.
And old Miss Hattie Drew, she beat my bottom with her bamboo pointer.
Oh, goodness.
-They still do that?
-Not in my class.
I withhold approval and affection.
It's more devastating.
Right.
I'd like to see that, my name carved over a toilet.
Well, come around and visit our john,
Brother John.
It'd be like Hannibal returning to Carthage in triumph.
Hannibal returning to Carthage in triumph.
-You talk like that to...
-Henry Birkhardt?
No, he'd only laugh and try to unbutton my blouse.
He's not all bad, is he?
Well, at least I left my name someplace.
Come around and visit.
We're very advanced here in Hackley.
We're integrated as far as the second grade.
Would you come?
Hey.
Big John?
Hey.
Number two.
I still don't like it.
Oh, hell, we lean over backwards.
When I worked for Mr Lowery Yaw,
I would have run that boy in, charged him with anything handy and then booted his butt over the line into Tarbridge County.
Damn. The London Times. What's that one?
Der Spiegel, that's German.
L' HumanitÃ©, that's the French communist paper.
Son of a bitch.
Look here.
Hey, that's Arab writing.
That's the same writing on my Shriners hat.
"This Bible was placed by the Gideons.
"Property of the Hilton Hotel,
New York City."
I told you that bastard came from up there.
"To John, truth, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. N.W."
-Well, I'll be damned.
-Hey.
I got something. Passport.
That's him, all right.
My, my, my. My, my.
I'll be damned.
God damn it.
The rest is just socks and underwear and crap.
When you went to the funeral, now, did you find out anything about him?
Well, now, why on earth...
Papa. Papa.
-A funeral, of all places.
-Papa.
Would you kindly put in your teeth?
All right, now, did he tell you anything?
Where's he been, what he's doing here?
No, no, just that he's passing through.
-You would like to have some milk, Son?
-No, no.
-Orly?
-No, I'm fine, Doc. Thanks.
I thought you weren't interested in him.
I thought it was just some sort of old man's story interfering with more important things,
Iike golf games with Perry Kermit and Archie Fanyon.
Never mind that.
Now. His passport expires August 5.
That means he's had it five years.
You got any idea where he's been?
London, Paris, Frankfurt, Germany,
Krakow, Prague, Moscow,
New Delhi, Bombay and Kuala Lumpur, Saigon,
Dar es Salaam, Mexico City, Quito, Havana,
Nairobi, Singapore. And that isn't all.
There were two more pages of stamps
I didn't even copy down.
Now, what in the hell is he doing in all those places?
Moscow and Prague and Havana.
-Hell, you can't even go to Havana.
-Maybe he hijacked a plane.
Now, look, it just don't make sense.
Here he is, a black man, as far as we know he never finished high school, so you'd figure he'd be driving a Payloader at Hill-Donaldson, sharecropping out in the county, on the food stamps.
All right, say he goes north.
Have the same kind of job in Cincinnati or New York.
I mean, where does he get off going from Paris to Saigon?
How does he pay for it? What was he doing?
What's he doing back here?
Sarah was about to die.
Oh, I'm serious, Papa.
And you said it yourself.
Nobody knew she was that sick, not till the operation. That's what you said.
You told me yourself, Mr Thomas.
There was that advisory from the State Bureau saying there was a fella coming down to make trouble at Hill-Donaldson.
No. No. Now, you take your ordinary outside agitator. Who is he?
He's some kid lawyer fresh out of Harvard,
Iiving on $30-a-week expense money.
That don't pay for this.
You travel like this, you're either a millionaire, or you're working for somebody who's paying the bills.
Maybe for the airlines.
No. That's different immigration stamps.
You see, there just aren't that many possibilities.
-A newspaper, or something like that.
-Good night.
An oil company.
But they aren't hiring any black kid who dropped out of high school.
It just don't make sense.
Damn it, I sure intend to find out.
Well, I say get him the hell out of town.
Let Joe Beckett over in Tarbridge County worry.
Oh, no.
No, this is something.
A black man from Hackley in Prague, East Berlin...
God damn.
What the hell you got a hold of down there, Lloyd?
-You said it'd be confidential.
-Well, yeah, but my God, man!
Look. You want to spend the next 10 years in a district office?
-What do you have in mind?
-I'm telling you.
Old Lowery Yaw's on his last legs.
He still thinks Lyndon Johnson's president.
All I need is one good break.
What do I need?
State's attorney general, maybe lieutenant governor.
-What do you want?
-I told you. Come on.
I got myself out on a limb getting this stuff for you.
-What is it?
-Okay.
As far as we know in the district here, this John Kane is unknown in connection with any civil rights organisations or foundations and crap like that.
And Washington got nothing, either.
That includes subversive front stuff and black militants.
Now, wait. Under another name.
They got a pretty good cross-index up there, Lloyd.
Well, could he be working for something
Iike the ClA or maybe a courier or something for the State Department?
ClA, no. We cross-checked.
And I called Marv Duberly on the security desk at State.
Yeah.
You really started something down there, boy.
They are running around that passport division
Iike somebody squirted them with boiling water.
I mean, for God's sakes, man,
Havana, Albania.
You know one of those marks turned out to be the stamp from the City Clerk's Office in Peking?
-But they don't know him?
-Hell, they don't want to know him.
They are, and I quote old Marv,
"At a loss to understand how this could happen."
In fact, it couldn't.
I'm dead.
Hey, hey, hey!
That's enough, that's enough.
Don't kill the man.
Soccer, soccer, play. Let's move it.
Scoot.
Come on, come on, put your shoe on over there.
Go on, go on, scoot.
You know, I haven't been able to find any source material down here for African culture except for Tarzan, which is hardly appropriate.
-ls it on a record?
-No.
I'd like to use it. Is it published?
-I don't think so.
-Where'd you learn it?
I happened to be there at the time.
You never got married?
No. I've been differently occupied.
-With what?
-My work.
-But that's finished now, right?
-Yes.
You said you had a few days.
What do you plan to do with them?
-Nothing.
-I think you're a liar, Brother John.
I think you're a very hungry man, and I think you're afraid to taste anything.
Talk to me.
Oh, hell, you're doing pretty good by yourself.
You're a very different breed of cat.
Right now, Brother John, the drums are pounding. You hear?
The jungle is alive with messages.
Miss Pettinghill is now going to phone
Miss Henrietta Johnson, and Aunt Patience Brown can hardly wait till the Ladies Aid meets tonight.
Why?
"Because dear Reverend MacGill's Louisa,
"you know, the one that was away, is walking down Huguenot Street
"with Sister Sarah's Brother John.
"And it's about time, too.
I don't like to say it, Sister Williametta,
"what that girl needs is a man to settle her down."
Fair warning, Brother John.
I only have a few days.
Want company?
Yes.
Well, that's all it is then, just a few days to kill.
That's all.
Okay. Then I stay here and let them wonder, and you go wherever you have to go.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
-Thank you, Helen.
-Sheriff's office.
I got me a good set of prints off that bathroom glass.
-Well?
-He's got a record all right.
-Where?
-Ludlow, Texas.
Vagrancy.
Did three months on the road gang there, and then just walked off.
And there's still a fugitive warrant out for him.
-That's all?
-Well, he was in the Army.
-You want one?
-Where?
-Korean War.
-Anything there?
I don't know. He got a medical discharge.
Agnes Day, I told you, I got to work.
Atterberry? Hell, no.
No, he always wants to play.
He wants to play bridge instead of pinochle.
I ain't playing no damn...
Lloyd, there's a fellow out at Hill-Donaldson from the Montgomery office of The New York Times.
-So?
-Well, when The New York Times takes an interest in a town like this, we are in trouble.
Just don't start anything.
Me? They're gonna have a strike meeting this evening, and I'll give you goddamn long odds that boy John is gonna be there.
Maybe.
-Let me pick him up on that Texas warrant.
-No.
No. If we move too fast, we'll never know.
Well, I'll tell you, Lloyd, because
I've got my areas of responsibility, too.
I'm gonna keep him under surveillance, and if I get anything on him,
I ain't waiting on you.
-Jimmy, you cut that out.
-Sarah leave insurance?
Just enough to bury her.
You working steady?
Just three days, part-time.
She made more money than I do.
She never told nobody, but it's the God's truth.
She said to me,
"My mama was the strong one,
"and my grandmama.
"And the world put them down, and they put down their men."
She said,
"Frank Gabriel, that's gonna stop right here.
"My children is gonna know the man is the man.
"And they gonna respect their daddy for the head of the family."
When I wasn't working,
I'd meet her down on Stuart Street, and she'd bring me her money from Mr George Baylor and Miss Fanny Jeffers, and I brought it home.
She said, "Hard times for the black man ain't your fault, Frank.
"And I ain't gonna see my man get cut down in front of the eyes of the children."
I got it, Papa.
Marsha Jean, you best put on another pot of coffee.
Papa?
Can I help you?
-You Frank Gabriel?
-Yes.
You ain't never been in trouble before, have you, Frank?
No.
I mean, you ain't one of them troublemakers, are you?
Anything you want in particular, Officer?
Don't rush me, Frank. Don't rush me.
You know that's not good manners.
-Anybody else here?
-Now, look, Officer...
-Who are you?
-That's my brother-in-law, John Kane.
I asked him, Frank.
I'm gonna tell you something, John.
You're under police surveillance.
I'm gonna save the both of us a whole lot of trouble because
I don't believe in pussyfooting around.
You know what I mean?
Now, you're gonna have to watch your tail around town, or you can get it whipped.
You get out of my house.
Oh, now,
I thought you were a smart negro, Frank.
My name is Gabriel.
Your name is shit, you talk back to me.
You get out of my house.
You red-necked cracker, get out of my house!
You work down at the Harris lumberyard, don't you?
Hey, Frank, I'm talking to you.
-You work down at the lumberyard?
-Yes.
-I can't hear you, boy.
-Yes!
Mr A.L. Harris, he's very strong for law and order.
Now, how long do you think he's going to tolerate an employee gets arrested for interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty, huh?
Hey, what I mean, boy, is you can be replaced with any buck negro with a strong back and a weak mind.
You want me to tell him that you talking back?
Well, let me hear you, Frank.
You got anything to say, Frank?
Then you gonna be a good nigger and keep your liver lip shut?
Officer?
-Yes?
-You want to talk to me?
-Yeah.
-Private?
-Frank, can we use your...
-Look, John, you don't...
Now, Frank.
Oh, no. You go right ahead.
-I told you a couple times.
-Thanks, Mr Kidd.
Don't think it's too funny, boy.
Just go on over like I told you.
-Any trouble?
-Not yet.
These boys don't finish right now, they're gonna pee their pants.
All right, I see any pop bottles flying, you boys are going to get whammed good.
Just keep them separated, that's all.
-Now, where's George?
-George?
-Well, he had to go home.
-Why?
He wasn't feeling too good.
All right, now give me attention here for a moment.
I want you all to know that they're having a legal meeting over here.
It's their right to have it.
-Johnny? Johnny Kane?
-Johnny Kane!
I just knew that was you sitting in the back row.
Hey, Charley Gray.
How are you, Charley?
What do you mean, how are you?
Give it to me.
Give it up like that.
Johnny... Hey, Bill, this is Johnny Kane.
Johnny Kane, Bill Jones.
Hi, how are you? Glad to meet you.
Hey, I'll see you over at the Ark.
I'll be over in a minute.
Man, what are you doing down here?
I'm just passing through. My sister died.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard.
I'm sorry about that, man. Yeah.
-Well, where are you running to?
-Nowhere.
Yeah, well, how come you didn't come up and say hello?
You were conducting the meeting.
I didn't want to bother you.
Jive!
Lou, you know how long... Me and this dude was in high school together.
Boy, you still just as big and black and ugly as ever.
Is that how you make friends with everyone?
Damn, Johnny Kane!
Johnny, if anybody told me just five years ago that we'd have a function alliance with that bunch of second-generation crackers...
-You think you can win?
-Got to, got to.
-These are boiling times down here, man.
-Even in Hackley.
Down here is where it's all happening.
Compliments of Local 747.
Man, I'm telling you, ain't nothing like chairing one of them meetings to dry you up.
Hey, I'm sorry, John.
No, thanks.
In fact, if you'll excuse me a minute.
Yeah.
Which reminds me.
Where in the hell have you been when we needed you?
-Working.
-Hey, baby.
For the man?
No.
Planning on staying down here?
Sure could use you.
You've been dabbing around long enough.
Time to squat and pay some dues, man.
I've paid.
I'm going over to Marion tomorrow night to meet a man who's come in from New York with a pocketful of good, northern New York integrated money.
Sheriff Orly Ball thinks he's coming here, but I'm going to fox him.
I'm going there.
Come on, go with me, ride shotgun.
You expecting lndians?
Hell, I don't know nothing about no lndians, but I tell you one thing.
Last time, I was chased by four crackers in a '67 Plymouth.
But if they ever catch me, they got a surprise coming.
I got an over-and-under shotgun sitting right on the front seat beside me, loaded with rusty nails.
Boy, if they ever catch me, God help them.
Come on with me.
Look at that. Look at that. Give me a drink.
Hey, hey, look, now. Come on, sit down and let me buy you a drink.
No, thank you.
Oh, come on, now, sugar mama...
Henry, please.
You saving it for the city folks, huh?
It's just that I'm overwhelmed by your charm.
Excuse me.
You weren't so goddamn fussy before you went off to school.
You remember, huh?
Behind... In the Chevy behind the gasworks.
It is one of my most poignant memories.
What did I tell you?
Look, Henry.
Let me put it in words of one syllable.
I am not the same girl you screwed at the age of 16.
Now, let me by, or I'm going to knee you right in the groin.
She's got balls, hasn't she?
Johnny.
Whose side you on anyway, man?
Look, look, Lou.
Lou, will you tell this dude he gotta come with me?
You kidding?
Nobody can tell Brother John anything.
He is the dude that walks by himself.
John Kane.
He in trouble?
Now, I want you to know he is a good boy.
He ain't in no trouble, Miss Nettie.
Then what did the police want with him?
This ain't no policeman, Miss Nettie.
This is Dr Thomas. I told you, remember?
'Course I know. I remember Doc Thomas.
John Kane, Miss Nettie, do you remember anything unusual about him?
No.
That's what I told Mr McCullough when he proposed him for the scholarship at the Tubman lnstitute in Marion.
I said John seemed very ordinary, but don't you be fooled.
But John didn't go to Tubman.
Isn't that a shame?
You know, I remember he came to see me before he left school.
I stressed the importance of the opportunities at Tubman, but he said he didn't have time.
I remember that.
Sixteen-year-old boy just smiling and saying he didn't have time.
-His name was John, Ella Kane's boy.
-Yes, Miss Nettie.
If he goes to Tubman, he can qualify and be of service to the people.
But he told me,
"l can't teach them. That's not my job."
Why, I gave him the sharp edge of my tongue, all right.
I said, "John, your father is away working,
"and your mother needs you."
And he said he couldn't help that.
He had to go.
I asked him when he's coming back.
"When the wind comes again."
He's back now, Miss Nettie.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Although, I do believe the scholarship to Tubman is already awarded.
I'm afraid it is.
You ask him to come to see me.
-I wanna see his journal.
-Journal?
I gave it to him for a going-away present.
I told him, "John, you keep your eyes open
"and your mind busy, and you write down something worthwhile every day."
It's a lovely journal.
Brown Morocco leather with gold design, and a pretty silk ribbon to keep your place.
Did you write anything in it, Miss Nettie?
I always do. I write the same thing.
"To," you know, whoever it is,
"truth, like beauty,
"is in the eyes of the beholder."
Signed, "N.W."
For Nettie Wheelock, of course.
I do hope he hasn't lost it.
He's still got it, Miss Nettie.
I warned you about Uncle Earl's sermon.
I think he meant you personally.
He was looking right at you when he said,
"Are you saved?"
Poor Uncle Earl. He's not too relevant.
All that talk about hellfire, damnation, judgement day...
Oh, I believe in hellfire. I've seen that.
Oh? How about damnation?
That's possible.
And judgement day?
Are you ready to answer for your sins?
Maybe it won't be that way.
Each man answering for his own sins.
Maybe man will answer as a species, not so much for what he was, but for what he might become.
That's not fair.
Maybe.
Anyway, it won't be tonight.
Do you know who they are?
My man, he is scared. Hold it, now, hold it.
Now, hold the water.
Here we go.
I got them! He's scared now.
Get off the road! Goddamn fools.
"Let me out of this car.
I wanna get back to Henry."
Go on, get him again.
All right. I'm driving.
I know what I'm doing, fools.
Give me some of that water.
Give me that stuff.
Hit it. Come on.
Don't be scared. Everything's under control.
Hey, you fool!
What's he doing?
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
Hey, boy! I wanna... Come on out of there!
-Come on, get out!
-Get out.
We are damned tired of you agitators coming down...
Open up. Open up this door.
Coming here like King Shit, thinking you can take everything over.
-Stop it!
-Who in the hell do you think you are?
Just 'cause some fancy-ass whore is putting out for you, you think you can take everything over?
Get out of there and fight.
What the hell.
Get out of there, nigger!
You tell him now, John.
Come on out, big man.
-Big man.
-Thinks he is.
I don't think so.
I got it.
This is gonna be nice.
I am gonna rip your ass.
All right, now.
Just what the hell is going on here?
What's it all about?
Ain't nothing. We just having a little discussion, that's all.
Is that right?
What are you doing around here anyway?
I was just passing through.
This thing still running?
Yes. I think so.
Keep on passing through, then.
-Get in it, and get the hell out of here.
-Wait a minute.
Hey, man, you won. Louisa...
-All right, now, come on, come on.
-Wait a minute, wait a minute.
All I can say... I don't know how to say it, except that all I can give you is what I got. I love...
You'll never know.
You'll never know.
Come in.
I'd better not.
Tomorrow's my last day.
Tomorrow?
Well, well...
What the hell, Brother John? What the hell?
Yeah, what the hell?
What do we have to lose, huh?
Well...
We really had them going there for a while, didn't we?
Old Miss Pettinghill,
Miss Henrietta Johnson,
Aunt Patience Brown.
"Praise the Lord!
"Louisa done found herself a man before it's too late."
I don't want you to go.
Stay with me.
Marry me, or don't. I don't give a damn.
But stay.
You said you understood.
Well, I'm a liar.
Look, man, you can't just split.
I mean, you can't go walking with a girl and then just cut out on her.
I love you.
Stay a little longer. A week, another day.
I can't.
All right.
I'll go with you.
I got nothing here.
I'll go with you.
I have to go alone.
When will you be back?
I won't be back.
Just like that? "Bye, baby.
"lt sure killed time between buses."
Did I come on too strong, Brother John?
Give me time. I'll back away.
I'm not proud, just tell me you love me when and if it creeps up on you.
I love you now.
But there's no time.
There is no time at all for anything.
Not for making love or living together, getting married, having kids, fighting, making up, sitting down to dinner.
I would like to be a father and sit at the head of a table and slice the meat and pass it to my son.
I would like to leave my name someplace besides the toilet of the Stuart Street school.
I would like to live and die.
A simple life like my father and my mother and my sister and Charley Gray.
However hard it was, I'd buy it.
If I had the time.
What do you mean, Charley Gray?
He isn't dead.
I love you, Louisa, but it makes no difference.
Oh, well.
Love sure kills the time till the last bus.
I don't understand, Brother John, but will you say goodbye to me before you go?
Yes.
I promise.
But he said he didn't have time.
I remember that.
Sixteen-year-old boy just smiling and saying he didn't have time.
I said, "John, your father is away working,
"and your mother needs you. "
And he said he couldn't help that.
He had to go.
I asked him when he's coming back.
"When the wind comes again. "
"When the wind comes again. "
Now, you drink this, Papa.
The car is a total wreck, Mr Thomas.
You're gonna have to send out a wrecker for it.
All right, I'll take care of it.
He said he was coming here, but he was out on Route 16, heading north.
I told you he was going to hurt hisself someday.
Yeah, yeah, thank you.
It's over $50 damage. Now, I gotta file a 326.
Now, just look at that.
Don't worry. He'll surrender his licence tomorrow morning.
Hope he does.
-Papa, were you drinking again?
-No, no.
Just my usual bourbon and branch, that's all.
-Are you sure?
-Mr Thomas, you wanna come out here a minute?
Come on, Papa. Now, you drink.
He's trying it under the ultraviolet.
I don't want them damaged.
Oh, don't worry. I got a regular executed search-and-seizure warrant from Judge Picker.
You tell him what for?
Hell, no.
I can't find anything, Mr Ball.
You got anything else you can use on it?
Not in the field kit. You ought to send these things up to the state lab at Marion.
-No.
-What the hell are we looking for?
Well, I thought it might be some kind of record.
-lt is.
-I could try a stronger solution.
Why should you think his secret would be so conveniently listed in that manual?
-Oh, Papa.
-Oh, yes.
Who knows what they do where he comes from?
Oh, yes, he comes from somewhere else.
He's gone all over the world, making those records that you can't read.
-What for?
-Well, that's the interesting question.
Well, then, where's he supposed to be going to now?
Papa, I'm going to drive you home.
He'll make his report on what he's observed all over the world.
-Boy, how you going to like that, boy?
-Come on, come on.
And you, Orly Ball and old Lowery Yaw.
-He's the one. John Kane.
-Yeah.
-I brought him into this world.
-I know.
That little kinky-haired black baby, and what happens to every damn one of us depends upon what he puts in those journals.
-You're a stubborn old man.
-Those blank pages.
Come on, I'm going to put you to bed.
No, I am going to stay right here.
-I want to see him.
-Papa, Papa...
I want to be here tomorrow when the wind comes again.
What tomorrow?
That's when he'll leave. He said so.
Is that right?
Well, that's what I heard.
Well, now, listen, Orly, you pick him up.
You don't let him get away.
Now, you wait just a minute, now.
When I said before to pick him up and get him out of the county, you said no.
Now he's going out on his own steam.
Now, you just get him. You hold him.
Now, look, Mr Thomas...
Till I find out who the hell he is and what he's doing.
Now, do I have to get Judge Picker out of bed and get a bench warrant?
No.
Where is he?
-Who?
-John Kane.
He's gone.
Where to?
Now, look here, John. You're in trouble.
Now, look here, John. You're in trouble.
You want me to ship you back to Ludlow, Texas?
-No.
-Well, then, you better answer my questions.
-I have been for some time.
-All right.
Now, you tell me why you've been travelling to all these places in this passport.
To see the world.
-Who paid for it?
-I did.
Where did you get the money?
I worked.
And what about this
Cuba, Albania, China?
You know, American citizen isn't supposed to go there.
Nobody stopped me.
Say, what's this book? It's...
It's in Arabic, right?
-Yes.
-What is it?
It's the Bible.
-That is quotations from the Koran.
-Can you read that?
Do you speak Russian?
Yes.
Chinese?
-Yes.
-What else?
Swahili.
French.
Spanish.
German.
How did you learn?
I listened.
What's this?
A journal.
Well, you've been carrying it around for years.
-Yes.
-Why are the pages blank?
I haven't written in them.
-Why not?
-lt wasn't necessary.
Well, then why'd you keep them?
To remember.
-Good morning, Orly.
-Good morning.
Yep?
Yeah, he's here.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Mr Thomas?
You got company. Reverend MacGill.
Damn it.
All right. Put him in a cell.
Mr Thomas, I've had a lot more experience than you, interrogating niggers.
You wanna see what I can get out of him?
No, I don't want any smart lawyer pulling a Miranda and Escobedo on me.
Now, just put him in a cell.
Morning, Reverend.
-Morning, sir.
-Good morning.
You'll have to excuse me.
I haven't had a chance to shave.
I was told you arrested John Kane this morning.
-That's right.
-What for?
-He escaped from a county road gang.
-When?
Oh, some years ago.
When did you first know about this,
Mr Thomas?
Now, look, I don't have to account to you for my official actions.
Well, he's been here never about a week, and l...
Well, I just received word on the Texas case.
Sheriff Ball's man told John he was under police surveillance several days ago.
Why?
I don't have to tell you that.
Because they think he's an outside agitator come to cause trouble at Hill-Donaldson.
Papa. I'm not making any comment.
Mr Thomas, he spent a great deal of time with my niece.
John has not been involved with anything here in town.
-That's right, ain't it, Louisa?
-Yes.
Brother John is not at all involved.
I'll be honest with you, Reverend.
I'm holding him on that Texas warrant because I want some information.
-Now, how much do you know about him?
-Very little.
-I don't think he's a Christian.
-I don't mean that. Louisa...
Miss MacGill, is it?
Do you know why he came here?
His sister died, and he had a few days to kill.
George!
-George, George!
-Yeah?
You get Calvin and the Oakes boys and Logan Pierce.
Tell them to get their tail out to Hill-Donaldson.
Mr Thomas, I gotta talk to you.
Reverend MacGill, you, too.
Get me the highway patrol barracks at Marion.
-What is it?
-I tell you, we got a damn mess on our hands.
Tarbridge County Sheriff's Office just called.
They found that Charley Gray about three miles outside of Monroe.
Dead?
Blew the middle out of him with his own shotgun.
-Son of a bitch!
-Reverend MacGill, I gotta talk to you.
God rest his soul.
Yeah, well, I'll tell you,
God's gonna be pretty busy. Now, look.
White is white and black is black, and I've always been straight with you.
And I'm going to tell you straight now.
I don't know who killed him, and I'll swear to that.
But if I get him, he's gonna stand trial.
And there ain't gonna be no phoney jury turn him loose. You believe me?
...right down through the middle.
I believe you.
All right. Well, now, your people are going to be damn mad, and I don't want to have to call in the highway patrol, because those boys are mean, and there'll be heads busted
-and gas and every damn thing.
-What do you want me to do?
They ain't going to believe a damn word I say.
I want you to come with me, and Folsom from the Baptist church, and Davis Higbee from the NAACP.
And we'll all go out to the main gate at Hill-Donaldson.
I'm trying to get Perry Kermit out at Hill-Donaldson now.
You tell Perry we'll be out there in about 10 minutes.
Did you get the highway patrol batch yet?
No, I'll get them right away.
I gotta tell Lottie Gray.
He knew.
He knew about Charley.
He knew Charley was dead.
What you talking about, girl?
Last night, John knew Charley was dead.
He listed them, his mother, his father,
Sarah and Charley, all dead.
Before it happened?
You hush your mouth.
You don't know what you're talking about.
It seemed like a slip. He knew about Charley.
You want to get John in more trouble?
Oh, Mr Thomas, how long you going to hold John here?
Just a few days, till I can get the answers I want. Excuse me.
-Orly.
-Come on home, Louisa.
I've got 12 men here.
Will you let me handle this?
Well, just tell them to lay off until...
Damn it, I didn't ask for any help yet.
I do not want them in here.
That's all there is to it.
I've got enough men to handle it myself.
I don't know what's going to happen if those highway patrol boys come in here.
I've got more than enough to handle it ourselves.
No, no, I'm not.
You bet.
-Sheriff Ball here. We've got problems.
-Papa.
Papa, you go on home and...
Willy?
Hold on, Doc.
Say, I'm glad you come down, Doc.
I've got a drifter over in the back cell with the diarrhoea, and it's a goddamn mess.
I'll take care of him later.
-Who are you looking for, Doc?
-Kane. John Kane.
Hey, boy! Drop your pants.
The doctor's coming.
John Kane.
Holler up when you want out, Doc.
Charley Gray is dead. They just found him.
Now, you told Louisa he was dead last night.
Now, the trouble is, my boy,
Lloyd and Orly Ball are going to think you had something to do with it,
'cause you knew about it beforehand.
They're not going to understand.
The weather report on TV says,
"Fair and warmer."
Poor Lloyd.
He's hoping you'd be some kind of foreign agent, so he could run for congress against old Lowery Yaw.
Well, I guess maybe you are.
It won't do him any good.
I told him what you've been doing, going all over the world, observing, making records in your journals.
Don't worry, he doesn't believe me.
See, it's not that I'm afraid.
I'm about done for anyway.
I get sick and tired of lying awake in bed at night,
Iistening to my own arteries harden.
I'll tell you, more than once, I've thought of running 10, 15 ccs of morphine into a hypodermic, cutting my losses.
But all the same, I do wonder.
You see, I brought you into this world.
I mean, I kept you alive.
When you were six years old, you stepped on a rusty nail.
I did that for you. They couldn't.
And so I must be part of whatever the hell it is, and I do wonder.
What have you seen?
Oh, I won't tell anybody.
They wouldn't believe me anyway.
What have you seen?
What have you seen?
I've seen people all over the world.
I've seen death and starvation and cruelty.
I've seen a county road gang in Ludlow, Texas, and beggar children shovelled off the streets of Calcutta into the river, and the fat and sleek oiling their bodies in the sun.
I have seen prisons in Africa and China.
And I have seen war in Korea, in Sinai, in Biafra, in Vietnam.
And I have smelt flesh burning and the stink of excrement when a man is killed and his gut squeezes out the last of life.
I have seen people swarming all over the world
Iike maggots on a rotten apple, getting ready to leap off the Earth.
First to the moon, and then to the stars.
Is that it? They just don't want us out there?
Will it be fire?
What's the difference? Fire, ice, fallout...
I guess maybe you don't care.
-I care.
-I wondered if you did.
What do you want from me, Dr Thomas?
I can't tell you anything.
I know.
You might just be a paranoid schizophrenic, and I might be a senile psychotic, sharing your delusion.
That's possible.
I thought it might be some comfort to you to talk to someone who knew.
They kind of stacked the cards against us, didn't they?
Send you to be born black in a town like this.
Was it...
Did they plan that, or was it just the luck of the draw?
It sure come home to roost, didn't it?
There are certain faces that I would like to see at the appropriate moment.
Well, I don't want to argue the point with you.
I'm just an old man, and when the time comes,
I got things in my bag I can take.
But I do wonder.
Have you seen any...
Have you seen hope?
Improvement?
A chance?
I've seen what's there.
And what about the innocent?
Children?
Just good people?
Don't they count?
What about love?
Man isn't just an animal.
He is capable of love.
That might not be enough.
Lloyd. He's going to have duck fits.
He's counting on climbing over you to get to Washington.
You don't have to do this.
I figure, but I brought you into the world, didn't l?
And I ought to be here when you go.
That makes sense, doesn't it?
-Willy!
-Right with you, Doc.
What will they do?
How long will it be?
When will it come?
Tomorrow?
The day after?
When?
My God, there must be something we can do even now.
We won't be seeing one another again, will we, John?
No, Dr Thomas, we won't.
Goodbye.
I am Arthur Frayn, and I am Zardoz.
I have lived 300 years and I long to die, but death is no longer possible
I am immortal.
I present now my story, full of mystery and intrigue, rich in irony and most satirical.
It is set deep in a possible future, so none of these events has been occurred
But they may
Be warned, lest you end as I
In this tale I am a fake god by occupation and a magician by inclination.
Merlin is my hero
I am the puppet master
I manipulate many of the characters
But I am invented too for your entertainment and amusement
And you, poor creatures, who conjured you out of the clay?
Is God in show business too?
SET IN THE YEAR 2293
Zardoz.
Zardoz.
Praise be to Zardoz!
Praise be to Zardoz!
Praise be to Zardoz!
Zardoz speaks to you, his Chosen Ones.
We are the Chosen Ones!
You have been raised up from brutality to kill the Brutals who multiply and are legion.
To this end, Zardoz, your god, gave you the gift of the gun.
The gun is good!
The gun is good!
The penis is evil.
The penis shoots seeds and makes new life to poison the Earth with the plague of men as once it was
But the gun shoots death and purifies the Earth of the filth of Brutals.
Go forth and kill!
Zardoz has spoken.
Guns!
You foolish!
I could've shown you!
Without me, you are nothing!
A bore!
How pointless!
How pointless!

Who lives here?
I am Arthur Frayn.
- No!
- Vortex Four.
I am Arthur...
Vort... Four.
Arthur Frayn.
Vortex Four.
I am... Ar...
Vortex Four.
I am Arthur Frayn.
Vortex Four.
Three from Vortex Eight.
Four from Vortex Five.
Did you ever see such mangled limbs?
- There was some kind of rock fall in their quarry.
- There are 14 bodies for repair.
- What is it?
- Flower.
- For what?
- Decorative.
- Do you know where you are?
- In the Vortex.
You come from the Outlands.
You were told about the Vortex?
- Zardoz says...
- What does Zardoz say?
Zardoz says if you obey him, you'llgo toa Vortex when you die... and there you will live forever.
- Happily?
- Yes.
So, you think you're dead?
Am I?
- You're an Exterminator.
- I kill for Zardoz.
You came here in the stone head.
I don't know.
It is the only path and passage into the Vortex.
You will show me how you come to be here.
- You have a name?
- My name is Zed.
Zed for Zardoz.
I am an Exterminator.
The memories are simple heroics.
There are no abstractions, you will notice.
It is certainly very fragmented.
The shock of entering the Vortex could be responsible.
Zarday 312.
Twenty-five Brutals exterminated.
Took a woman in His name.
Zardoz.
The place... where the sea meets the land.
It's blacked again.
It seems to be able to control its memory.
Show us more of your work.
Zardoz made us grow wheat.
This is a more recent memory.
Cultivation has started.
- Disturbed?
- A little.
- The Outlands have to be controlled.
- I've always voted against forced farming.
You eat the bread.
We have to shut ourselves off.
We have to.
This is the first direct visual contact... with the Outlands in years as opposed to data...
...since Arthur was delegated to control them.
- It is proper that we investigate.
It's better not to know.
These images will pollute us.
Quench it. Quell it.
No Brutal has ever penetrated a Vortex.
It therefore requires study.
Perhaps it can tell us why Arthur has vanished so mysteriously.
May...
Please.
Is Arthur Frayn's memory transmission still functioning?
Arthur Frayn ceased transmission three days ago.
Replay his last memory moments.
No. Play back the preceding images so we can discover how he suffered this fall.
It is permitted only to show the accident.
No other memory image may be shown... without the consent of the individual concerned.
But we need to determine the location in case he is injured and the body has to be recovered.
Arthur Frayn died.
Reconstruction has begun.
Ah, yes. There.
That'san end to it.
- Kill it, May.
- No.
May, for our love.
- Consuella...
- Don't.
I will invoke a community vote.
- The community will follow my intuition.
- Then I will go to the Vortex.
- You're hurting me.
- Consuella, this is an experiment!
We must find out how it came here!
Where is Arthur Frayn?
How did you come into the stone?
Zardoz... The stone.
Terribly exciting.
- What of the suffering?
- Oh, you can't equate. Their feelings with ours.
It's just entertainment.
Again, this is a key image.
My father was Chosen.
My mother was Chosen.
Only we could breed.
Only the Chosen.
Selective breeding, do you think?
What has Arthur been doing out there all these years?
Never discuss this in the Vortex.
You'll have to be thoroughly investigated.
No one else wanted to run the Outlands.
He's an artist!
He does it with imagination.
I love to see them running.
I love the moment of their death when I am one with Zardoz
Obscenely decaying flesh.
The sweet scent of put refaction already in the air.
He's a fine, strong beast.
Dear May,
- What exactly do you want to do with him?
- A full genetic study. Break its DNA code.
See if there are any structural or evolutional changes since ours were analyzed 200 years ago.
Discover any new hereditary disease factors that may have emerged... which might result in broadening our immunization spectrum.
Study its emotional and psychic elements in relation to its sociology.
That all sounds respectably scientific, but what is May's under-thought?
Not long ago she was asking for new births, although we have no death.
We are perfectly stabilized.
We said no to May.
Now she wants to bring in this animal from the outside.
Think about equilibrium.
Remember the delicate balance we must maintain.
The presence will dismay our tranquility.
May is a great scientist, but she also has destructive tendencies.
- We have adequate means of controlling it.
- Surely, we are not so vulnerable!
Look at it.
It knows its life is at stake.
Otherwise, it would rape and kill, as it always has.
- I don't agree.
- No, no!
- You can see the disrupting effect.
- Let's keep it.
- Yes!
- Anything to relieve the boredom.
- I want to see more of its memories.
- So do I!
This is a psychic disturbance.
Avalow, what does it portend for the future?
How did we conjure up a monster in our midst, and why?
That is the question we must answer.
Well, you've set their fur flying, my friend.
I wonder what's going on inside your pea brain, hmm?
I like you, you sly old monster.
Do you hear?
- Yes, vote. Vote.
- Let's vote.
Pro.
Against.
Verdict.
Congratulations.
You live... for three weeks.
Zed.
I'll examine him later in the dome.
Morning, monster.
Time for work.
All right, let's stop all the nonsense, shall we? Where's Arthur Frayn?
Ever hear the expression 'lf looks could kill? ' Well, here they can.
There's no need to pretend innocence with me.
I'm in Arthur Frayn's confiidence.
I know more than you think.
You're saying nothing.
All right, we'll wait and see.
Don't be sullen.
I'm going to look after you.
Whenever you're ready to, just ask me questions.
Anything at all.
This is where you'll be working for me each morning.
Just menial tasks, nothing too taxing.
- Is this your god's house?
- Ah, it's God you're seeking, is it?
Well, here we are.
Gods, goddesses, kings and queens.
Take your pick.
- But they're all dead.
- Dead?
Died of boredom.
That's wrong.
It's wrong!
It is cataloged according to your instructions.
I told you to analyze design growth across all makes of car, not just a chronological list from one manufacturer!
A much more complex program.
Shall I seek Vortex consent for a longer program?
- Shall I seek Vortex consent...
- Yes!
- It will take time.
There is a stack-up on some circuits.
Well, I've got time, and plenty of it.
Three weeks.
Define three weeks.
Twenty-one days.
Five hundred and four hours.
Thirty thousand, two-hundred and forty minutes.
One million, eight-hundred... and fourteen thousand...
Do you believe, he's never seen a clock before?
Obviously not!
- Are you not taking food with us, May?
- No.
Come, Zed, this way.
- She's taking her studies very seriously.
- She only has three weeks.
- Doy ou know yethow the Brutal came here?
- No conclusion.
Insuffiicient data received.
Go in.
Go on.
- Look into the ring.
- No retina abnormalities.
Fundus normal.
Disc and retinal vessels normal.
No hemorrhages or exudates.
Macula area clear.
Attention... Continuation of the trial of George Saden of Vortex Four.
George Saden, accused of transmitting a negative aura in Second Level.
This is not so.
I have studied our social, emotional substructures for 140 years.
These thoughts are constructive criticisms, pyramidical.
I am innocent of psychic violence.
As you examine my face and eyes, you will see that this is true.
He's lying.
Vortex Three.
You looking for the head, monster?
It's gone. Off on its endless journey from Vortex to Vortex, round and round like me and the bread, forever and ever.
- Will he be punished for that?
- Of course.
But you have no police, no Exterminators.
Ah, but we discuss it endlessly!
Every little sin and misdemeanor raked over and over.
- So, what happens to him then?
- He'll get six months at least.
- Prison?
- Aging.
- Aging?
- Yes! I'm getting old myself.
Three months here, a year there.
These sentences add up.
So, if you're bad often enough, you'll die.
They make you old, but they don't let you die.
- So, what's to stop you killing yourself?
- I do now and again, but the eternal
Tabernacle simply rebuilds me.
- Would you like to see immortality at work?
- Yes!
Well, get a move on then!
This is where they live, the Renegades.
They're condemned to an eternity of senility.
We provide them with food, but they are shunned.
They're malicious and vicious, so in and out fast. l, myself, feel quite that moving.
- Hey!
- Look, I like it! I like it! i Like...
Loamer.
Gray.
I loved this girl once, monster.
You idle Apathetic!
Melancholy sight.
Grayler.
Bones.
Whoa there, boy. Whoa up.
You are asked to vote at the termination of the trial of George Saden.
Final statement from the accused begins.
I confess to the charges, but plead mitigation.
I tried to suppress these thoughts, but they leak out in Second Level. through the head wound of my third death.
I was imperfectly repaired.
No. That is not true.
- I think what I think.
- That's more like it.
I'm with you, George.
I hate you all.
I hate you all.
I hate you all. especially me.
Vote, please. Vote, please.
I'm voting for him, monster.
It won't do any good. Nothing ever does.
Absolute acquittal.
Go on, monster, help your self.
Didn't Zardoz tell you about the Apathetics?
It's a disease.
And it's slowly creeping through all the Vortexes.
That's why Zardoz made you grow crops... to feed these people.
We can't support them anymore.
Apathetic or Renegade, make your choice.
Yes. A bit frightening, isn't it?
Very good.
Now you're beginning to show yourself.
Final votes.
For, 9;
Against, 586; undecided, 86.
Sentence. George Saden will be aged five years.
Welcome to paradise.
Penile erection was one of the many unsolved evolutionary mysteries surrounding sexuality.
Every society had an elaborate subculture devoted to erotic stimulation.
But nobody could quite determine how this becomes this.
Of course, we all know the physical process involved, but not the link between stimulus and response.
There seems to be a correlation with violence, with fear.
Many hanged men died with an erection.
You are all more or less aware of our intensive researches into this subject.
Sexuality declined probably because we no longer needed to procreate.
Eternals soon discovered that erection was impossible to achieve.
And we are no longer victims of this violent, convulsive act... which so debased women and betrayed men.
This Brutal, like other primates living unselfconscious lives, is capable of spontaneous and reflexive erection.
As part of May's studies of this creature, we're trying to find, once again, the link between erotic stimulation and erection.
This experiment will measure autoerotic stimulation of the cortex, leading to erection.
Play.
The tracer indicates that this image is not erotically stimulating to the Brutal.
Change.
This doesn't seem to affect him either.
Consuella's done the trick herself.
The Brutal is now in fourth hour of unconscious sleep.
It's astonishing that Homo sapiens spend so much time in this vulnerable condition, at the mercy of its enemies.
Is there any data on the sleeping patterns of primitive people?
- Is that a priority request?
- Yes.
I'm now going to test its waking response to danger stimuli.
Does it please you to sleep?
Yes.
Why?
I have dreams.
Sleep was necessary fo rman... when his waking and unconscious lives were separated.
As Eternals achieved total consciousness, sleep became obsolete and Second Level meditation took its place.
Sleep was closely connected with death.
Look at it. It's you.
Your genetic structure.
Your life chart.
Look!
You are a Mutant.
Second, maybe third generation.
Therefore, genetically stable.
Enlarged brain.
Total recall.
Your potential is...
- Your breeding potential...
- Breeding?
Frayn. How did you get into the Vortex?
What is your purpose?
I'm just an Exterminator. I know nothing
You must know that you're mentally and physically vastly superior to me or anyone else here.
You could be anything.
Could do... anything.
- You must be destroyed.
- Why?
- Because you could destroy us.
- As you've destroyed the rest of life?
Can you un-know what you know now about me?
For the sake of science, I will keep this knowledge from the others for the moment.
Keep you alive.
But you must follow me, obey me, be circumspect, make no disruption, quietly do whatever work is given you.
I will watch over you.
Get a move on, you silly beast.
Friend, put that thing outside!
Anyone else disturbed?
Then let's take yet another boringly democratic vote, shall we, Consuella?
It's Friend's day to make the food.
He must do this without help as we all do.
It's fundamental to our society that we do everything for ourselves on a basis of absolute equality.
- And Friend knows that perfectly well.
- Yes or no?
Potatoes, yes or no?
I say get more Zeds to do the work.
We have eternal life, and yet we sentence ourselves to all this drudgery.
I tell you, I'm sick of 200 years of washing up.
And I'm sick of pitting my bare hands against the blind brute stupidity of nature!
- You'd better do something about this.
- Consuella is right.
Zed is being kept here for scientific study.
It can earn its keep on the land, but it should not do the work of a servant.
Time enough has gone to finish your study, May. Destroy it!
No! No. No.
See how it disrupts our community?
- It is almost over.
- How can you speak such in front of Zed?
It feels. I sense that.
- Vote!
- Yes, vote!
Give your votes.
May has been given seven days to complete her study.
Then Zed will be terminated.
The monster is a mirror.
And when we look at him, we look into our own hidden faces.
Meditate on this at Second Level.
No.
No.
I will... I will not go to Second Level.
No.
I will not go to Second Level.
I will... No!
I will not be one mind with you!
I know what...
I know what May wants with Zed.
No!
No.
The Vortex is an obscenity!
I know...
I know that I hate all women.
Birth. Fertility.
Superstition.
Friend is beyond redemption.
- Renegade.
- Renegade.
Friend, he's a Renegade.
He must be cast out.
He is no longer one with us.
Renegade. Cast him out!
No!
Renegade! Renegade!
Caution. You are approaching the periphery shield of Vortex Four.
Caution. You are approaching the periphery shield of Vortex Four.
Have you seen Friend?
Friend. I seek Friend.
Friend.
I seek Friend.
Friend.
Old Friend.
This is your fault.
Now hear this, you old farts!
Meet this creature from the outside world.
- Huh? What?
- This man has the gift of death.
- Death?
- He can mete it out, and he can die himself!
He's mortal.
- He can die!
- Die!
- Shall we give him back to death?
- Yes!
- Silent death?
- Yes!
- Glorious death?
- Yes!
May, the scientist, wants him to spawn another generation to suffer our agonies!
Come on back to death!
Stop! Stop!
What is it you want?
Sweet death. Oblivion.
For yourself, or for the whole Vortex?
For everybody.
An end to the human race.
It has plagued this pretty planet for far too long.
You stink of despair.
Fight back!
Fight for death, if that's what you want
I thought at first you were the one to help.
But it's hopeless.
All my powers have gone.
Where is it, the Tabernacle?
The Tabernacle is...
- I can't remember.
- Who made it?
Someone must know how to break it.
Yes.
You can meet him for yourself.
One of our founders. One of the geniuses that discovered immortality.
But he found he didn't like it for himself.
He didn't conform. So this is what his grateful people did to him.
- We want to die!
- Hmm?
- What's the trick?
- Death.
Death.
Talk to May.
May?
May, I want your help.
You want to destroy us. The Tabernacle
I want the truth.
You must give the truth... if you wish to receive it.
I'm ready.
- It'll burn you.
- Then burn me.
Tell me... everything.
Show me pictures.
Open your mind.
Your memory... go back to the beginning.
- Open.
- Zar...
- Open.
- Zar...
- Open!
- Zardoz!
Zardoz gave us the gun.
We were the Chosen Ones.
What was your task?
To kill the Brutals, who multiply and are legion.
We rode out. We roamed the Outlands.
We killed. It was enough.
Man was born to hunt and kill.
- And then?
- Then, one day...
- Yes?
- Something happened.
It changed everything.
I... lost my innocence.
A face in the window.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
He wore a mask.
He led me on like a game.
Why did you spare him?
Something... Uh, I don't know.
- Had you seen a book before?
- Never.
- You learned to read.
- Yes.
- How long did it take?
- It came easy.
I read everything.
I learned all that had been hidden from me.
I learned what the world had been before the darkness fell.
Then, one day, I found the book.
The book called...
Uh, called...
What was the book?
What was the name of the book?
- I don't remember!
- Tell me.
- Show me. You must tell me!
- No! No!
Zardoz.
Tell me. Show me. You must tell me.
I can't! You saw him carved in stone.
Can't remember!
Yes you can!
- You knew that Arthur was Zardoz.
- No!
- You killed Arthur, didn't you?
- No!
Show me. What are you doing?
You murdered your own god by accident.
Or was it an accident?
Now, show me that book.
What did you find in that book?
Show it to me.
It's a trick! A trick!
What was a trick? Tell me!
Zardoz said, 'Stop. '
Said, 'No more. '
- No more what?
- No more killing.
- He told you to take prisoners?
- Yes.
- To make slaves?
- Yes.
- To cultivate instead of kill?
- Yes!
- To grow wheat?
- Yes!
- Did you need wheat?
- No. We ate meat.
Zardoz betrayed us.
We were hunters, not farmers.
Show how you came into the stone.
Show.
It was easy.
Each season, Zardoz came down to take our harvest.
Zardoz.
- Your friends were Mutants too.
- Yes.
- You had a plot.
- Yes.
- Revenge?
- The truth.
We wanted the truth!
- I told them about the book.
- Show it. What is 'the book'?
No. No.
No! Zardoz.
Zardoz is pleased.
- So that was it.
- The Wizard of Oz.
Zardoz.
The Wizard of Oz was a fairy story, about an old man who frightened people with a loud voice and a big mask.
It was Arthur Frayn's idea.
A simple way of controlling the Outlands.
But remember the end of the story.
They looked behind the mask and found the truth.
I looked behind the mask, and I saw the truth. - Zardoz.
So, that was your plan... to stow away in the head.
Yes.
What was your purpose? To kill Arthur?
To penetrate the Vortex? To find a way in for your friends to destroy us?
- He made us killers.
- Revenge! You wanted revenge.
The truth!
The truth.
Truth or revenge?
Revenge!
Revenge.
Mm. I remember feelings such as those.
They stir in me.
So this is your scientific investigation.
There's another word for it. Bestiality.
For this, you will be aged 50 years, no less.
No man, woman or beast will ever desire you again.
He can't see.
He's blind.
We can no longer quell him.
He's out of control.
We must now become hunters and killers ourselves.
Come.
This will restore your sight, and you will see more and deeper than you ever saw before.
I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch.
I see now why you are here.
You are the One, the Liberator.
Death.
I will help you... if, when the time comes, you will set me free.
You have great strength, but there are times when that strength will fail you.
Eat this when the need arises.
This place is built on lies and suffering.
How could you do what you did to us?
The world was dying..
We took all that was good and made an oasis here.
We few, the rich, the powerful, the clever, cut ourselves off to guard the knowledge and treasures of civilization as the world plunged into a Dark Age.
To do this, we had to harden our hearts against the suffering outside.
We are custodians of the past for an unknown future.
You are the price we now pay for that isolation.
You have brought hate and anger into the Vortex... to infect us all.
Get him! Get him!
Kill him!
- It's indestructible.
- No! No! It can't be done!
No!
Caution. You are approaching the periphery shield...
Ride round. Fast!
He's somewhere in these buildings.
Smoke him out. Cover the exits.
Over there.
We've got him trapped.
There's no one in here.
We... take life from you.
Life flows out of you. Flows into us.
Get him! Get him!
Come on!
Search the undergrowth!
Come on! Look over here!
He's no...
He's not here.
It's getting dark.
- It's him. It's him!
- None of them could catch him!
But he falls into the hands of the poor old Renegades.
Death.
Bring... Bring death to you all.
Find Friend... Take me to Friend.
- What'd he say?
- Shut up.
It's a miracle! We're Apathetics.
Tell us how, please.
We want some too.
We started chasing the Brutal.
We got excited.
We saw someone.
We thought it was him.
It wasn't, but we killed him anyway.
And then we felt desire.
Look at the excitement you've caused.
You naughty girl.
Your task is to secure allarms, weapons and food supplies.
Work house to house, east to west down the valley.
If you find the Brutal, destroy immediately.
He's trapped. It's only a matter of time.
Friend. Friend!
Kiss the bride, dear Friend.
Kiss the bride!
You did well. I will take the bride.
Death comes closer for us all.
Find May. Tell her that Friend needs her.
Friend, I cannot sanction this violence and destruction.
It's too late, May.
There's no going back.
Don't destroy the Vortex!
Let us renew it. A better breed could prosper here. Given time...
Time?
Wasn't eternity enough?
This place is against life..
It must die.
I have my followers.
Inseminate us all, and we'll teach you all we know.
Give you all we have.
Perhaps you can break the Tabernacle.
Or be broken.
An end to eternity.
A higher form.
Revenge.
Charge!
- How much time do we have?
- We will not work in time.
You will take our knowledge... by osmosis... out of time.
We will touch teach you, and you will give us your seed.
...where it is assumed that E-75 equals R-and M-75.
Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things.

Through me you pass into eternal sorrow.
Through me you pass among the forgotten people.
Marxist philosophy held that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe.
This law operates universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking.
The central nervous system no longer occurs as a self-contained organism,
Now, you know all that we know.
It's a prison. A prison.
No, it's an ark. A ship.
A space ship.
All this technology was for travel to the distant stars.
- Did you go?
- Yes.
Another dead end.
How did it come about?
The Vortex. How did it start?
They did it. They were the scientists, the best in the world.
But they were middle-aged, too conditioned to mortality.
They went Renegade. We were their off spring, and we were born into Vortex life.
We seal ourselves... here with... into this place of learning.
Death is banished forever.
I direct that the Tabernacle erase from us all memories of its construction, so we can never destroy it if we should ever crave for death.
Here, man and the sum of his knowledge will never die, but go forward to perfection.
We applied ourselves to the unsolved mysteries of the universe, but even with infinite time and the help of the Tabernacle, our minds were not up to it.
We failed.
Two. Four continuations of the same, two anomalous.
...is to be changeless, and matter...
And now we're trapped by our own devices
There is no exit.
Violence has the tendency to accelerate.
However, the concept of total
Destroy it! The Tabernacle!
Kill the Tabernacle.
The Tabernacle is indestructible and everlasting.
This crystal shall join us each to each, and all to the Tabernacle.
A crystal joins them. A crystal.
Now we have given you all that we are, one gift remains, which contains everything... and nothing.
Look into this.
You will see lines running into the future.
You will make insight jumps.
When you can see into this crystal, then you will be ready. Only then.
I see nothing inside, except my own perplexity.
Knowledge is not enough.
I have come for you.
Overhere.
- We've met before, I believe.
- Arthur Frayn.
Come now.
My Brutal friends call me Zardoz.
Revenge!
Now, we're even.
'Would it have been worth while...
'to have squeezed the universe into a ball...
'to roll it towards some overwhelming question?
To say, 'I am Lazarus, come from the dead? '
Do you know the next line?
It's T.S. Eliot.
'I am Lazarus, come from the dead.
Come back to tell you all.
I shall tell you all. '
Well done, well done.
You've learned your lessons well.
What will you tell me?
What do you see in the ball?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Then I have nothing to tell you.
That way! There!
What do you see in the ball?
Consuella.
I've ached for this moment.
You cannot. You will not.
The hunt is always better than the kill.
In hunting you, I have become you.
I have destroyed what
I set out to defend.
'He that fights too long against dragons... becomes a dragon himself. ' Nietzsche.
I am not like the others.
I would fill you with life... and love.
You have given me what no other gave. Love.
If I live, we will live together.
Go now.
The Brutal is not here. I was mistaken.
Refraction of light. Infinite.
Break the Tabernacle. Or be broken.
What do you see in the crystal ball?
When you see into the crystal, then you will be ready.
Now I see it. I am ready.
Tabernacle? What are you?
Not permitted.
- Where are you?
- Not permitted.
Do you know me?
I have your voice print, Zed, and your genetic code.
But only memory fragments.
Tell me about the crystal transmitter.
I cannot give information which may threaten my own security.
Brain emissions refract low-wavelength laser light, passing through the crystal in the brain.
They are a code sent to you for interpretation and storage.
- Yes or no?
- Not permitted.
A receiver must be like a transmitter.
I think you're a crystal.
In fact, this one. This diamond.
In here, there is infinite storage space for refracted light patterns.
Yes or no?
You have me in the palm of your hand.
But you could be elsewhere.
Yet I choose to be here.
- Why?
- To confront you.
Already you have learned to see my light wavelengths in the diamond.
Now, you will try to erase the refractions and destroy me.
Your aim is to destroy me, isn't it?
Yes.
Would you kill God?
Such vanity.
I am the sum of all these people and all their knowledge
I am all-seeing.
I am everywhere and nowhere.
That has often served as a definition of God.
Would you destroy us and all that we are?
Yes.
Would you not rather be part of us, joined to us, a light shining to the future?
Love us! Cherish the truth!
No!
You have penetrated me.
There is no escape.
You are within me.
Come to my center.
Come into the center of the crystal.
Tabernacle!
Tabernacle!
Tabernacle!
Tabernacle!
No!
No!
No!
You have destroyed us.
You found the flaw in the crystal.
We are gone.
You are alone.
Take him to the east door.
Oh, it's too late. He's finished.
Consuella, no.
Stay close to me, inside my aura.
Where did they go? Where?
They went up there.
Can you tell us how things stand?
Wh-What next?
An old man calls me.
'The voice of the turtle is heard in the land. '
I...
I remember now.
The way it was.
We challenged the natural order.
The Vortex is... an offense against nature.
She had to find a way to destroy us.
Battle of wills.
So... she made you!
We... We forced the hand of evolution.
A good death.
You've done it!
He's dead!
- Look!
- The stone head!
Take this, and let your sons and daughters look into it.
Ride east. There, you will pass through the wall.
What will become of you?
Will you go back to your people?
There is no going back for me.
Put 'em out of there! Get out!
Stop! It's useless. It's over.
- The Renegades are all dying like flies!
- Dying?
- It's not Zed to blame. We destroyed ourselves.
- That's truer than you know, Consuella.
And here I would like to claim some credit.
You see, our death wish was devious and deep.
As Zardoz, Zed, I was able to choose your forefathers.
It was careful genetic breeding that produced this Mutant.
This slave who could free his masters.
And Friend was my accomplice!
Don't you remember the man in the library, Zed?
It was I who led you to The Wizard of Oz book.
It was I who gave you access to the stone. It was I!
I bred you. I led you.
And I have looked into the face of the force that put the idea in your mind.
You are bred and led yourself.
Arthur! We've all been used.
- And reused.
- And abused!
And amused!
Death approaches.
We are all mortal again.
Now we can say yes to death, but never again no.
Now, we must make our farewells. to each other, to the sun and moon, trees and sky, earth and rock.
The landscape of our long, waking dream.
Zed... the Liberator, liberate me now... according to your promise.
Do it. Do it!
All that I was is gone.
Kill me too!
- Let's kill each other, Friend.
- Huh? What?
- Proper regard for irony.
- Yes, yes.
One last trick?
Success.
It was all a joke.
I want to die.
Please!
Kill me, I... I want to die!
Please!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!
Zed!

close to the point of no return.
Of course there was a great deal of rhetoric
about saving the earth, but,
In reality, very little was done.
Then, one day,the polluted Earth
 could take no more.
Yeah?
Hello, John?
Look, I've just had a call.
We've got to get out of  London.
Things are moving very fast.
They'll be closing the cities today.
- I'll be there in half an hour.
- We'll be ready.
OK.
- What's happened, John?
We have to leave right away.
They are closing out the cities today.
Roger will be here in half an hour.
I heard the phone ringing, mommy.
Is it about---?
Yes, darling, Roger will be here shortly.
Please hurry.
What about Davey?
I telephoned the school yesterday and said we'd be there on short notice.
Mommy...
-Please hurry. Get dressed.
-OK...
Oh, John, a year ago I wouldn't
 have believed it could happen to us.
The famine in China,  India
and most of Southeast Asia
is undoubtedly a major
 historical catastrophe
The epidemic of grass disease
has spread to Africa and parts of South America.
All types of gramini,
the botanical term for the grass family,
wheat, rice, rye, barley, etc. are affected.
-Hello Roger.
-Hello.
What brings you to this end of town?
Well, I'm in charge of a couple of projects now in a laboratory just around the corner.
Oh...This is my brother, David.
-How do you do?
Dr. Burnham. How are you?
His father was my CO in Korea.
-Oh, was he?
He comes over the house regularly to see Mary and play some money off me in Bridge.
The Emergency Committee of World Ecology
has come to the unanimous conclusion:
That cumulative residue of pollutants
and pesticides,
in both the soil and
 the atmosphere,
are the cause of the grass disease.
Because of its infectious nature biochemists feel that it is carried by a virus.
So far no cure has been found.
However, if such areas are carefully destroyed by fire,
the virus is easily contained..
According to Sir Charles Brenner...
Chief of the department...
Brenner told me that it's spreading everywhere.
The following maps show the expense
of the areas of infections.
There are rumors at the lab that the home secretary has already drawn up a few little plans: like food rationing and restrictions on travel...
- And just in case, Martial Law.
- That doesn't sound very promising.
David just told me that he's turning most of his acreage over to the tubers crotch, you know.
Potatoes, beets.
Yes, and I'm thinking of killing off all the animals and having them preserved.
- Oh, you farmers. You're petty pessimists.
- He's bloody smart.
Starvation deaths in the affected countries
are now estimated at upwards of one hundred million.
And it will be worse here than it if is in Africa or Asia where they're used to famine.
John, I want you to bring the family out to the farm if and when...
Look, I'll know a bit ahead of the public at the lab, you know, if the regulations are going to be put into effect.
I'll let you know, John.
Right, and if you do that,
I'll make room to you, too.
- That's very kind.
- Well, that's very smart.
If things get really bad, we'll need someone along that we can put in the pot.
George, do you  know what was the thing that caused the virus?
It's because them Chinese fertilize everything with human shit.
- George, did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did.
And if it's true, I can sell it to them
 cheeks for a blooming fortune. ????
Are you going on a little trip, sir?
Yes, that's right, constable, just off for a few days in the Lake District.
I'd steer clear of Notting Hill and
East Finchley if it were you, sir.
I heard there were some trouble there tonight.
Thank you Constable.
There you go, sir. ????
Attention.police personnel are expected to keep
their weapons loaded as from now.
There are no longer any official figures
 on starvation deaths worldwide. 
but authoritative sources have now placed
 the number now over  600 million.
everywhere in India, pitched battles have been reported between army troops and the uprisings populous .
the news that starving Chinese
have engulfed Hong Kong has been verified.
Locally the  pollution cloud is lifting,
but the Ministry emphasizes
that physical exertion should be avoided in the London area.
Oh, to hell with it.
Let's go out and have dinner.
Oh I'm sorry.
The butcher had nothing but goat and horse meat.
I took the goat.
Oh, that reminds me.
My construction foreman can give us canned beef he said, of a slight of it.
I said splendid,50 to 100 pounds.
What do you think, darling?
It may sound silly, but I think it would be
 cheating with the people in the queues.
I'd rather take my chances
 like everyone else.
- I've made up my mind, darling.
- What about?
My virginity.
I've really thought about it.
I don't want it anymore.
- You'll have to. Good god, 16.
- And a half.
Please, darling, on the farm there won't be much to do.
- Your father would shoot me.
- No, daddy wouldn't. But mommy might.
-She thinks I'm still a child.
- You are, you know.
Well,then...Make me a woman
Help us! Somebody help!
-Please, help!
-Help!
In Leeds, following the crisis due to sewage
seeping into the city water supplies,
an outbreak of cholera has been reported.
The  situation worldwide in regard
to the famine is serious indeed.
In the countries which no longer have any organized government,
there are reports of widespread Cannibalism.
The Home Secretary has
just issued the following announcement:
"The government strongly denies the allegations
by sir John Clotton of the opposition
that there is scarcely a week's supply of food in the country
and emphasizes that stock are sufficient. ".
Sufficient for everybody to starve!
It's the government's view that danger could
only come from panic in the population at large.
Accordingly, various temporary regulations
are being put into effect immediately.
They've jumped the gun!
All cities of over 300,000
population are sealed.
Military barricades are preferably being erected...
-Jesus...
-Christ!
I'm so sorry about that.
It's dangerous to breathe nowadays.
This graph shows the decline
in grain surfaces in the United States.
Better tighten the old belt some more.
... has unanimously condemned as barbarous the nerve gas bombings
by the Chinese Air Force of major population areas.
The Chinese government justified this horrendous action as necessary for survival.
For comments, we have eminent ecologist
Sir Charles Brenner in the studio.
Sir Charles, what is your reaction to the Chinese slaughter
of 300 million of their own people?
Well, now it appears rather barbaric on the surface,
but logically, they were acting to ensure
the continuity of the Chinese nation.
- But from an ethical point of view...
- Can we assume then, Sir Charles...
...that in the unlikely events of a similar famine hers,
you would call such an action by our government equally logical?
- It's extremely unlikely that...
- It is unlikely, Sir Charles.
But,if...if the unlikely became a reality, would you then...
I will not have you put words in my mouth.
I'm merely asking...
You are trying to force me to 
...a declaration regarding acute...
We must apologize for the break in transmission.
Normal services will be resumed as soon as possible.
Bloody music!
I hope we won't have to destroy all of the Crocuses because...
Oh lord, there's a patch
 right in the middle of them.
Yeah, that's it. Oh hell,
I might as well burn the entire lawn.
Oh, no, John.
Can't you just burn around it?
No, once it starts like that...
I'll ask the gardener what else I can put in.
Alright...
John, why can't we go to
Manitoba? Just for a few weeks?
Until we see how this awful virus thing is going over here.
Mother and Father haven't seen the children
 in two years! David was hardly seven.
But if it gets any worse,
Canada is much safer.
But I can't go until my building's finished.
This is the big one. An architect doesn't just walk off.
- But it's almost finished.
What difference does it---
- It's not finished until it's finished.
I just can't darling.
Look, why don't you go with the children?
No, I can't go without you.
Well...
- It'll be alright, love
- I hope so. I'm getting frightened now.
Come on, let's get a move! Come on!
Be careful, John!
Torp, drop it over!
Cut it out!
They're crazy!
Let's get out of here!
The cops are coming.
Get behind the truck!
Look out, the cops!
Look out, they got tear gas.
My eyes!
Knock it over! ????
- There are armed men on the roof.
- And another one by the shop.
I'll get the one on the shop!
I take care of the one on the roof! ????
Let's go!
Look, Roger.
We could rejoin the
A1 in Huntington.
We might get around a back road here if I remember rightly.
Point number two
We need some firearms.
Guns?
Who is that?
Mr. Sturdevant?
It's John Custance.
- Who? Who's there?
-It's John Custance.
Mr. Custance?
Wait a moment.
What do you want?
I...I'm sorry to bother you but...
I'm just going on a holiday to the lake district and I need ammo for my 22.
Oh, I'm not open at this hour, but come in.
-Mr. Sturdevant, this is Mr.Burnham.
-How do you do?
The door on the left.
You should have come at a reasonable hour, you know?
A standard load?
Oh, um...that would be fine.
You want one box or two? my stocks are getting pretty low, you know.
We better take two.
And uh...I think we are going to buy a couple of sporting riffles.
- Can we look at the pistols you have?
- Yes. You have your permit, of course?
Well, actually no, I didn't  have time.
But I thought after all you do...
No, not without a permit.
Curse. It's a pity, well, in that case...
... I'll have to take them.
- You are breaking the law.
- Be quiet!
I'm very sorry, Mr. Sturdevant.
We'll pay you, of course
And we'll tie you up. So you would be breaking the law.
I got a gun on you!
Don't move.
-That's it, Pirrie.
-Get your hands up. and move into the center of the room.
I've told you, Mrs.Pirrie, not to come into the shop.
What's wrong, Andy?
Look, I'll be totally honest with you, Mr. Sturdevant
The situation here is approaching anarchy.
There are riots in London already, and shooting.
Millions of people are going to die of starvation.
Mr. Burnham here is on the inside.
I'm a government scientist, working on the virus.
There is no solution inside.
I fail to see what that has to do with your actions here.
There's a rumor in government circles, and the rumor may well be true, that the big cities will be nerve gassed ???? as they were in China.
Now, we're going to my brother's
 farm in the north.
There's plenty of food. If you give
 us guns, we'll take you along.
I'm sorry, Mr. Custance, but I have got complete confidence in the integrity of our government.
Keep them coming, Pirrie.
Wait a minute, Mr. Sturdevant.
- What if it's true what they said?
- What if---
- It's nonsense!
You just mind your job, my lad.
I'm not asking for your opinion!
Me and my bird...my Mrs....we'll take you up on your offer.
It'll just take us a minute to pack.
I am very useful with weapons, and cars and things, Mr.Custance.
You'll need a bloke like me the way things are.
Corporal?
When the tent is secure, pull up the rest of the barbed wire.
What the bloody hell is this contraption doing in the middle of the road?
I live in Shetfield. I want to go get home!
It has been on the radio, sir.
They're making special arrangements for people like you.
All roads to the city are closed.
Well, get that bloody thing open again!
Well, get this one open anyway.
- You heard what I said, sir?
-  Get going.
Get that bloody things open, you stupid bastards.
Corporal!
We have orders to shoot anyone who gives a struggle.
If you're not gone within 10 seconds, we'll let your habit to be carried back.
Corporal!
One...
Two...
Three, four... five, six... seven, eight, nine...
Ten.
Roger!
Come on, Roger, get up! move.
Go on! Shoot that barricade, go on!
These stunning guns are good; we could use these.
No military weapons, we don't want to get caught with them!
Throw them in the ditch!
There was no other way. Was there, darling?
No.
- Why did you do all the shooting?
- I had to. I couldn't wait.
You are going to find yourself
 hanging by the ????
I thought you were going to take them by surprise, tie them up.
Well, that was the plan.
But...
I should be relieved if I could send all the ???? home. and could close the school for the time being.
Yes, I think you were quite right to
 get out of London while you could.
The news is very unsettling.
All this violence.
-Yes, yes I know.
-Well, Goodbye, Mrs. Custance.
Goodbye Sir.
And Davey, keep up with your Latin.
It will stand in good stead.
Cassop is got the wind up.
Well so should I, with a child like you to contend with.
-Hello Spooks.
-Hello Spooks.
-Hello, Spooks.
- Good Morning, sir, Mrs.Custance...
I have brought a little gift for Davey.
Well, that's jolly nice of you, Spooks.
I told him that he could have anything I left in my room.
Is that OK?
- Of course, love.
-Yeah sure.
Thanks, Davey.
When will we see each other again?
Spooks, are you staying here?
I suppose so.
Spooks hasn't got a mother and his father lives in South America.
Buenos Aires, I think.
I haven't heard from him in 14 months.
Well, you know, conditions have been rather difficult there.
Yes, I know. Even cannibalism.
Spooks, would you like to come with us?
We're going to a farm in the north.
- Thanks ever so much!
- That would be super!
Honey, how long are we going to stay out there in the farm?
How the hell do I know?
Why?
Well, we'll get a smashing time out there, won't we?
You forget the smashing time.
Just keep your legs crossed.
I wonder what David will
 think about the Pirries?
David will give them some food, they'll get on their way. No problem.
I hope so.
Boys, I want you to stay away from Pirrie.
But I like Pirrie, mommy.
Davey, I don't want to argue about it.
Now, you've heard me.
Yes, Mommy, but there should be a logical reason.
There is a very logical reason...
 I said so.
-May I talk to Clara then? She's nice.
-No!
For a couple of logical reasons.
There are reports of even more serious outbreaks
particularly in Liverpool,
Manchester and Leeds.
In the case of Leeds, official contact has been lost. 
In view of the disturbances,
there is some danger that the country might lapse into anarchy.
A1 closed except to  military vehicles, sir.
- What's the reason, sergeant?
- Some sort of trouble in Leeds, sir.
- Where is it you're wanting to get to?
- Well, we live in Westmorland.
I should backtrack into
 the offroad if I were you.
You cut off just before Selby, and get into Tadcaster that way.
- I wouldn't go near Leeds at all, sir.
- Thank you, Sargent.
The government has issued the following statement:
the duty of responsible citizens is to cooperate with the police
and military authorities.
Any violators 
will be dealt with most severely.
- They're heading north.
- You think to Leeds?
My God...
It's insane to have to wonder like this about our own aircraft.
Well...
Daddy.
Can Spooks and I ride in
Roger's car for a while?
In the front seat so we could see things better?
It's not for you to decide!
Daddy, daddy, please.
Alright, alright, just for a while.
I should think we could get north of Ripon today.
Ripon?
We can do a lot better than that.
Look, it wouldn't be worth it.
Pushing things.
These roads are not so good.
I'd like to be there as soon as possible,darling, even if we drive all night.
As long as we get there.
The main thing is to keep clear of population centers.
All right, everybody.
I want you all to use the toilet,
I don't want to stop later.
- Mary, those trees look Os.
- Boys!
Can I do anything for you Mr.Custance?
Uh, no no...
- Aren't you cold?
- Me? Cold?
Never.
- What's up with you?
- You embarrass me, that's what.
I told you not to wear that blouse.
For Christ's sake! They've all seen knickers before .
You don't have to shove them down their throats!
I'm warning you, I'm not taking
 nothing more from you.
Balls.
Having further rioting in Central London,
Martial law has been declared by
Prime Minister Willing.
What an idiot. Too late, as usual.
In feathers while London burns.
... In South London, an attempt has been made by organized mobs
to break through military barricades. set up early this morning
following the temporary band on travel..
Army headquarters expect to have the situation at hand..
Oh why didn't you pass them?
This isn't right. They can catch up at Tadcaster.
- Come on, Roger, you can catch him.
- Pirrie has a fast engine.
Oh, step on it, Andy, step on it!
Can't you catch him, Roger?
Come on.
Well, if I catch him this time, he will pass me again.
Go, we'll get them.
Damn. These bloody country crossings there's always a train to get through.
There doesn't seem to be a train coming yet.
Don't you think he might let us through?
He might, for a quid.
Hello?
Hello, could you let us through, please?
I'm just going....
- John!
- Daddy!
Your daddy's coming! ????
You heard this guy. He's got your dad. ????
Help!
Help us! Someone in the house, please help!
Help!
Shut the fuck up!
Please, someone, help!
Please.
Help!
Help me up.
Try to remember.
Do you know which way they took them?
-No, I passed out.
- They got your car.
Please!
Please!
Not her!
Get your hands off!
Come on!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Get off!
Help!
Please, help!
Help! Please, someone!
Oh! Please!
Get up, I'll show you how it's done.
Alright. We're done with talk, you never seem to control it.
Don't shoot! Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
- Ann, darling. Mary.
- One got away. I didn't have a clean shot.
And this one. They're going to
 take no chances hitting Mary.
Besides, the guilty don't deserve to die as quickly as the innocent.
Hold there...????
Missus, don't let him kill
 me! don't shoot! Missus!
Don't let him kill me!
I'm dying. ????
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Pirrie.
Under existing Marshall law, a curfew from 8 PM to 8 AM
will go into effect immediately in Great Britain.
Anyone seen on the streets during those hours will be shot...
Get away from here!
-...come on! Quit it!
Look, I've got it.
This is the Citizens Emergency Committee
 in London.
We have taken charge
of the BBC.
The former Government or anybody pro
Minister Welling has fled the country.
Stand by for an emergency announcement
-Stand by.
-It's all falling apart pretty fast.
This is London
- It won't always be like this, darling.
- It won't?
This is the Citizens Emergency Committee
 in London. Stand by
Do we have to listen to this bleeding racket all night?
Why don't you shut up?
- Talking and snoring all the time.
- Stand by for an emergency announcement.
This is London.
We bring you the first bulletin of the Citizens Emergency Committee.
The facts are these:
We found that the former government of murderers
was about to execute a plan to drop never gas bombs on British cities.
It was calculated that if
half the country's population were murdered,
it would help the rest to survive.
Bloody idiots.
Now they'll really start the panic.
Stand by for
further bulletins.
- Get him! Get him!
- Get away you little bastards!
Get out of the way!
Get this truck, come on!
Hurry! ????
The Emergency Committee is making arrangements
for collecting whatever food is available and having it fairly rationed .
If the country only shows the spirits
of the battle of Britain, we can pull through.
Any action against the Citizen's Committee will be severely dealt with.
- Stand by for further bulletins....
- Stay by for what?
You know, just two days ago, we were still a civilized country.
It will get worse every minute now.
None of this would have happened if we had gone to Canada.
- Oh, darling...It could have happened anywhere.
If was safe, my daughter would not have been raped.
All this because of a building.
But if we hadn't left, and things hadn't got as bad,
I would be an architect that no one would employ.
I did urge you to go..
You knew I wouldn't, because, what with you it was a building.
Nobody could finish it
 except you!
All right, time to move on!
I know Cassid will look like this.
Boys, you stay with Roger.
OK, Dad.
You know...
If I could change things,
I would, you know that, don't you?
Of course, Daddy.
Mommy is just upset.
Mostly about me.
Poor Daddy.
- Can we help you with your wagon?
- Thank you. No.
- We have all the help we require.
- All right, everyone out. ????
You fellas search the lot. ????
You  know what we need.
Come on, lady, get out of there.
- Hurry it up!
- Come on.
Walk those kids out of the way so they won't get hurt.
Find some weapons and some ammo.
Hey, here's some food.
Why are you doing this?
We haven't done you any harm.
We're doing what we have to for our town.
Survival, mister.
I guess you had a taste of that.
That is a pretty stiff penalty for what you're doing.
There's a worse penalty these days: starving to death.
- What are you going to take from us?
- Anything we can use, mister.
At least let us have one car and some petrol.
No.
Please, we've got the children.
Sorry, no car.
My god,what kind of people are you?
Same kind of people you are, ma'am.
I hope it happens to them.
To have no feeling for the children.
It could have been worse.
At least they let us take some clothing.
They didn't have to.
What are you doing, Pirrie?
Hey, good for you, Pirrie.
What about ammo?
- I thought they'd come in handy.
- That's very intelligent, Pirrie. even with one gun, now we can find a farm house, take a car and some petrol.
And perhaps another gun.
Guns yes, but no more cars.
Cars are only an invitation for an ambush.
You too, Mr. Custance
I bet you were a military man, eh, sir?.
Much to my regret, yes.
- But of course...
- Oh, no. Nothing to do with the eye.
I just hate killing.
We have about 50 miles to Davis.
I think we can do it in two days if we have no more trouble.
It doesn't seem like it today.
The earth's climate is getting warmer because of all the pollution in the air keeps the heat in.
And the polar ice caps will melt and everybody will be drowned.
Yes I know.
And then not enough of the sun's rays will get through now.
So, everything will die anyway.
We've got nothing for sale.
 Not if it's food you're after.
Well, it is food we're after, but we have nothing to pay with, we were robbed of everything but if you could let us have a few potatoes.
Touch one potato and I'll fill your ass full of this.
Pirrie...
I'll get you out the door.
Be careful, John!
-They had another gun.
-Yes.
Let's get these bodies moved into the cellar.
OK, Mr. Custance.
I'm glad we picked up some guns.
It's important.
- Did they shoot at you, Daddy?
- Yes, Davey.
- Where are the bodies, Mr. Custance?
-Out of the way.
Everything is different now, boys.
We have to fight to live.
Do you understand?
- Like in the Westerns?
- Yes, like that.
- Hey, Spooks, look at this frog.
- Where?
Oh yes.
- There was no point in washing up now.
- I know,  I just wanted to.
I think I've got something
 coming through. A short wave.
Good. Let's move on.
The sooner we get there, the better.
I had to put a skirt on.
The trousers were cutting my crotch ????.
Bloody thing's had it.
It's fragmentary.
But all the evidence indicates that France, Germany, Italy,
in fact all of western Europe
along with a major part of Asia,
South America and Africa,
have ceased exist as part of the
civilized world.
In this midst of complete anarchy and mass starvation,
the horrors of cannibalism are pretty widespread.
-My god.
Numerous air crafts have been arriving 
in Canada and this country from Europe.
By order of the President, the people in them  have been granted asylum.
The president  of France and
senior members of the French Government,
and members of the Belgian royal family
are now in this country.
It is reported from Halifax, Nova Scotia
that the British Government and the
Royal Family have landed there safely.
British Prime Minister
Thomas Welling
set rumors that major population centered in England
were to be bombed as were done in China,
were entirely unfounded.
It caused an uncontrollable panic.
The president's speech today expressed
the feelings of the entire country.
This was part of it.
We as a nation are shocked by what is
taking place in other parts of the world.
Here at home...
Well...
Pirrie, you better take this.
You have the best shot.
- I'll take the pistol.
- OK.
Alright, let's go!.
I'm ready, Mr. Custance.
What's the matter, darling?
Don't you love me anymore?
Yes...
- It's just... I feel that I can't...
- I understand.
... everywhere.
And now more than ever,
in the face of this worldwide catastrophe,
we must survive and preserve
in our nation
 the heritage of man's greatness
Oh look, It's so tiny.
Must have been only a few days old.
Why, John?
Why so many?
They must have eaten diseased grass. ????
At least we will get out of the wind and the rain.
Yes.
Roger, Pirrie, we'll have to take turns on guard duty.
It's isolated enough, but
 we can't take chances.
- Can't you sleep, darling?
-No.
You must try.
The going gets rougher
 as we go further north.
I want to be so tired that
 I can't think or feel anything.
It will be different when we get to the farm.
What will be different?
That we'll have food and drink?
Is that what you mean?
We'll be able to live like human beings at least.
Sounds crazy, but we're lucky
What do you think, I mean can you imagine... what will happen when those mobs from London get up here?
And army units?
Are they going to stand by and obey orders?
Whose orders?
No, we're lucky, I tell you.
I don't want to talk any more.
Your turn for guard duty, Mr. Custance.
What the hell are you doing wandering about?
What? I wasn't wandering about.
I just couldn't sleep.Have you got light?
Yes, but we can't spare matches anymore.
Oh...oh, you think of everything, don't you?
You know, I don't envy you one bit, Mr.Custance, because you've got nothing here but problems.
Why is your missus giving you a hard time?
I don't wish to discuss my wife with you, Mrs. Pirrie.
Oh, Clara.
Nor do I wish to give you one, if that's what you're after.
Come on now, that's not the truth, is it?
I mean, about not wanting to, it's just that there's no time, isn't there?
And who knows? tomorrow we might all be dead.
I think you'd better go back to bed.
Oh, alright, then, but just say goodnight before I go.
I thought you'd be a bit more careful
 on  guard duty, Mr.Custance?
- Now just a minute...
- I know plenty of you, Mr.Custance.????
I know you don't want to be number 1,669. Do you?
What the hell are you doing here?
What you did before we got married didn't bother me.
No, I mean, it was none of my business.
But after...
Oh for Christ's sake, We've been over this a thousand...
- I have not finished!
- Just one more time?
- Let go! You are hurting me.
I got my pride, Mr.Custance.
I've thought of killing her before, but the price was too high.
- Just what are you getting at, Pirrie?
- I mean the law, the old law.
Well, there isn't any now, is there?
If there were we should all hang.
Right. Well, you know a lot about a lot of things, Mr.nCustance.
- So what kind of law is left?
- The law of the group for survival.
And in the family?
The head of the family. Right?
I am the law there.
Subject to the law of the group, Pirrie, always.
It's alright to kill for food now,
So why not for my self respect?
Oh, for God's sake!
You're breaking my arm!
I want my rights!
No, we'll send her away.
 She can fend for herself.
That is not a punishment. She's got a survival kit between his legs.
Oh, help me, he's gone crazy! Oh, help me!
- I want my rights, Mr.Custance! Now!
- Let me go!
My God, Pirrie.
Why did you do that?
We have to tell Mary and
 the boys it was an accident.
To my wife and Roger, I'll tell the truth.
Whatever you say, Mr. Custance.
It's so horrible, John.
Why did you let him?
I couldn't stop him.
What do you mean? You're the leader.
He has to do what you say!
- If he thinks that...
- No, this was something special. Personal.
And let's face it, I'm no match for Pirrie with a gun.
I'd only get myself shot, too.
-And my being alive, that is important
-if we're all to get to Blind Gill.
-I'm sorry.
Oh darling, it's all been too much for me.
I know what it's been for you. I forget how hard it must be.
And you, my love?
- Is it any better?
- Not quite so bad.
But it's strange, the thing that bothers
 me most is that I have killed a man.
Good god, Ann, after what they did?
I know, but it has nothing to do with what I did.
Roger, keep the boys back with Mary.
She is alive. She is moving.
I saw her!
Come on, get back. 
Go on, get back. ????
I'm scared!
Please, kill me.
It's worse around the towns but
 now the farms are getting it, too.
- I wonder what's happening at home.
- Do not think about that.
- I can walk now, Mr. Burnham.
- Oh, stop talking. I'm just a horse.
- Really, if you could just cut me a cane.
-Shut up, I need the exercise.
- I was having trouble a lot in those days.
- What kind of trouble, Pirrie?
You know Mary, Pirrie is my surname.
Andrew. Andy. 
Call me that.
Of course, it's just that everyone calls you Pirrie.
Anyway...
When my mom took off, I was 13 then.
I stayed with this aunt and this uncle.
I was always getting into something.
So, I pushed off; me and a pal.
So, we got caught one night.
They caught you?
Doing what?
Pushing drugs.
Hold up. Let's take a rest.
I was picking up 10, 15 quid a day.
Me and my pal... we got a year in prison for that.
And then?
Well, you live and learn.
Unless you're stupid.
I got the  job at Mr.
Sturdevant's house. ????
I hated it, but I like guns.
But not any type of guns.
I used to see all the Westerns.
"Billy The Kid", "Doc
Holiday", "Wyatt Earp"...
Mary, you can come up with me now, darling.
- I'd like her to walk with me.
- What do you mean walk with you? Why?
- Why not?
- Because I want you as rear guard.
- She can walk back there with me.
- What the hell is this about?
You want me to be more explicit?
I'm a widower now, and she's a single girl.
- Are you crazy!
- Out! Out!
Pirrie, this is neither the time nor the place to discuss such of this sort of thing.
And we hardly know you.
I suppose it must come as a kind of a surprise.
I can imagine what all of you are thinking.
But everything has changed.
The whole world's changed three days ago.
But I'm the right man for her now.
You're crazy, that's what you are!
You killed your wife, you're a murderer and now...
We all are.
Aren't we?
- John, I got the bastard covered.
Shall we...
- No, we can not survive this way.
I'm glad you said that, Mr.Custance.
Because Roger's gun is on safety, and mine is ready to fire.
So is mine, Pirrie.
I'm afraid you will have to accept my decisions as leader of this group.
Particularly concerning my family.
If you fire first, I might fire
 too, so might Roger.
And in any case, you'd never get into Blind Gill.
Mr.Custance, If Roger, if anybody makes a wrong move,
I'll shoot you...
And I still think I could get Roger first.
Mary, come over here.
Stay here.
- Mary...
- Mother, Daddy...
Please.
I want to. Really.
It's because I...
I feel safe with him.
John, don't let him, please don't let him.
I take it what Pirrie wants is to get to know Mary.
Is that right, Pirrie?
You might put it like that, Mr.Custance.
We can't hurt anybody. 
Can we?
That's the sort of  group we need, men with guns.
And Ann, Mary, boys...
Go up there to that porthole and stay there until I call you.
Be careful.
I'll talk to them.
Just a minute!
- You wanted someone?
- My name is John Custance.
We're making our way to my brother's farm in the hills.
It's in a valley which is blocked in one end and then there is a narrow entrance at the other.
There is food there and it is easy to defend.
Why are you telling all this for?
We are looking for recruits.
You're looking for recruits. 
We're not.
In a few days, mobs will be fighting over every potato patch.
Those who don't have enough ground they could hold, will tent to savages if they have survived at all.
That sounds reasonable. won't do any harm to have a look.
- Where is that place?
- That's my business. Not yours.
I'm the leader here. If you do as
 you're told you'll be alright.
So it's like that, is it?
That we do what you say?
Well, you can think again!
I give the orders in this lot.
And if you want to join up with us, you'll do the same!
What we need is brain's men, this seems to be a sad lack of that in your fat head.
You little bastard!
The offer still stands.
Anyone who wants to come with us, form up behind me.
- I'll come along. And me family.
- We'll come along, too, my wife and I.
- That goes for me and my family.
- Well, I thought he sounded reasonable.
- We'll come along too.
- My name is Pirrie. Andrew Pirrie.
This is Roger Burnham.
As you and your family take your places, shake hands with Mr. Custance and identify yourselves.
I am Alf Parsons.
I have a wife and daughter.
By the way, that's Joe
Ashton's wife, Emily.
Emily?
My name is Bill Riggs.
I have a wife, two kids,
I'm an excellent shooter and
I am very good at the cook.
Joe Harris is my name and that's my wife, Liz.
The name's Scott and my wife, Sue.
My name is Locke, and this is my wife, Jill.
We're going to have a problem.
There's going to be a rough journey.
No problem, Mr.Custance
Jill is a strong girl.
No problem at all.
My name is Rand Blenitt and this is Maureen.
We'll be happy to join you. Our village was destroyed yesterday.
We barely got away with just a few things.
My name is Surgit and 
I have a wife called Sheila.
Jess Arkwright.
My wife Susan and three kids.
- I'll see you later when it's dark.
- OK.
Don't be angry
I'm not.
I love you
Darling, I can not stand it.
Try to hold on until we get to the farm.
Alright.
Let's get moving!
Hey, watch out, there's a dead calf.
- Darling, you can't go on.
- Yes, I can. We have to.
-Let me do it. 
-No, no...
Do as I say.
John, John, that mansion looks deserted.
Can't we stop here?
Some of the women and children can't go on.
And that pregnant girl...
They shouldn't be here.
I warned them.
Our speed can't be governed by the weakest in the group.
We still have another 25 miles to the farm.
What if I'm the weakest?
Or Mary?
Pirrie, I want you up here.
The women and children stay back.
The men who with Gus move up and spread out.
Why Pirrie? 
I'll go.
No, no, Roger, this is a job for Pirrie.
I want to carry my weight, John.
Oh for Christ's sake, Roger, there's no need to risk!
This is a routine thing.
We know what to do, Mr.Custance.
Riggs, Parsons.
Oh my God!
Can we give her some more Whiskey?
It won't be long.
-It won't be long now.
- I wish we had a proper midwife with us.
I'd like two me own.
Oh, God help me, oh!
-Squeeze my hand.
Darling, you remember how to turn a baby...
Yes. I remember.
We're almost there.
I can't wait.
It hurts.
Take a little more anesthesia.
No, I want to be aware.
-Take it.
-It's time.
I'm dying to see if will be a little Mary or John.
Squeeze my hand
Once more, Mrs. Custance.
We're there now. ????
Calm down. ????
Now.
It's a  Mary.
Mary Oh darling...
Isn't it wonderful?
Can I see her, please?
God rest his little soul.
Jill, I'm so sorry.
Don't darling. We'll...we'll follow them.
Gunfire.
What's going on?
I do not know. 
We don't want to go near it.
- But won't we get lost if we---
Actually, I don't even need a map up here.
Not as long as I can see the landmarks.
David and I did... dozens walks around here.
If you can afford it, even if you must stretch a little,
Why deny yourself the best?
Imagine settling back and relaxing while you drive a new
Rolls Royce silver Comet.
Seats are covered in superb British leather, .
front seats go up and down, forward and back, tilt with fingertip control,
World carpeting throughout.
Exquisite Walnut woodwork.
Upper and lower ventilation
You can warm your feet and cool your face at the same time.
In fact, there is very little you can't do in a Rolls Royce.
If you have ever considered owning a Rolls Royce,
there is no time like the present..
Looks peaceful enough, Mr. Custance.
Except for the barricades, of course.
Wait a minute.
Let's get out of here and back into the trees.
Corporal, get your men around the back.
Get them out of the window!
Get closer!
Riggs! Parsons!
Go to the hill, if it's clear, wave us on.
- The bloody troop.
- Let's hide. Go, go. ????
Ann, get back.
Listen, you men...
Those fools down there have committed an act of mutiny in the field and are going to be shot.
I do not want my men to share the same fate.
Now I want you to forget this and I want you to go back to your barracks.
What do you want us to do there?
Sit and starve?
We haven't seen a meat for weeks.
You're going back.
You can't do anything. There isn't an army anymore.
We'll take care of ourselves, bloody officers.
Sergeant Major, tell the men to form up.
Come men, form up!
We'll be on our own. 
Get out of our way!
Repeat the order, Sergeant Major, and any man who doesn't instantly obey, is committing an act of mutiny in the filed. You have to shoot them.
- Carry on.
- Form up!
- They was asking for it.
- Sure, they would have shot us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait.
Now.
- Davey, no, you can't drink that!
- It looks clean, Daddy.
It isn't!
Listen, everybody!
This river is polluted for miles.
Don't let your children drink it.
Years ago, David and I caught dozens of fish in that river.
Now, with factories up and down, you can't find anything until way past the farm.
This is all so beautiful, darling.
John, do you...
... will you still love me like before in spite all this...?
I feel so unclean.
Darling, I do love you.
What's going on here?
Let me go! 
What is your problem?
No Paki is going to push me around.
That was my place.
-Like hell it was!
- I picked this place for my wife.
Lookout, I had my bag there first!
That is not true!
He's right. I saw him do it.
- Well, he doesn't own the land!
- Stop it, the both of you!
Parsons, you move to another spot, but first...
I saw you hit Surgit without justice.
Now, Surgit, you hit him back.
All right, let's forget it, everybody.
- I am sorry.
- That's OK.
Oh no, Mr. Custance, I don't know what we'll do.
He can't go on.
He's only got one lung, you see.
Did it happen?
A year ago about.
He was working in the factory in Bradford.
It got his lungs.
All that smoke.
Go with the rest,
I'll be alright.
You go on and I'll catch up with you.
Of course.
You go north until you get to the road and then you follow it.
We'll see you there.
Alright, let's move on, everyone!
Darling, darling...
Alright, time to move!
Darling, it's time...
- John,he's the one who...
- Yes, I know,  I saw him too.
Get over those hills, by the rocks, quick, fast move!
Hurry!
Run!
Over there!
Hurry, hurry!
Come on. Hurry, hurry!
Come on, they're gaining on us!
Up there!
Wait, wait, wait!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Clear shots!
Don't waste ammo!
-I can't leave my pots.
-Oh, forget your damn  pots. You get down.
Stuart, keep down!
Spooks, this is just like Custer's last day.
I hope not.
Bill!
He's dead.
- Maureen!
-Mrs. Blenitt! No!
Get over here. Maureen!
- Pirrie get here.
- She's right in line. ????
Mrs. Blenitt.
Come back here, you band of bastards come on.
Damn shotgun.
It won't reach them!
- Dad!
- Take the gun.
Help1 I can't!
- Where did they get you?
- My arm, it is nothing. Get down.
Arkwright, use this.
All you women, over there.
Men on the back and we'll fuck in on them.
Cartridges! ????
Go there! Watch out!
He's going to fuck you ????
Come on now, hit it! Hit it!
-It ain't worth it.
- It's better than nothing.
The trees haven't been hit as much up here.
Yes, it's clean.
The grass. What will happen
 if they can't find a cure?
I don't know.
We'd like to join up with you sir.
Sorry, we have no more room.
Please,sir, the only choice we have
 is to join up with a bigger group.
You couldn't keep up with us.
The child could be carrying
John like the others.
Do you have any weapons?
Well, this ax handler.
Well, it's not much use against guns.
I'm sorry.
- Let's move on
- Please.
-No, Ann. We just can't.
Hey, look at that place!
It really takes it back. Look.
That's quite a fortification.
Trust David.
It will be good to be on the other side.
He certainly must have been preparing for some time.
Get back behind that wall!
Who's been hit?
My God, it's Pirrie.
You're not going.
It can't be David up there.
He would have recognized you.
It's my own fault. A whole bloody mob approaching with guns.
Mary!
- A bullet hit my head. ????
- Daddy, look.
It's just a scratch. That's all it is.
You can walk?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Help him, Mary.
That was an accident. if you don't get the hell out of here, we'll aim for you.
I'd like to have a word with David Custance.
I'm his brother John.
Oh, that's it. 
Come on in!
I can't believe it.
Johnny, it's good to see you.
It's very good to see you too, believe me.
I'm sorry about the shooting.
I did not know it was you.
- Is somebody hurt out there?
- No, it was just a hit on the handler.
Good, good. I told them all here to watch out for you, but...
I never thought you'd make it.
With the news on the ban on travel and then all the riots,
...and the rumors of the bombing.
Yes, it is a long story, but it can wait.
- Can I bring my lot in first?
- Your lot?
All those people out there they are all with you?
Yes, we have all been on the road for some time.
They can't come in, Johnny.
You, and your family and Roger.
It was agreed from the beginning, yes, but. no others it's impossible. the farm would never support them.
A mile of land and they can plant some crops.
That's not the point, mister.
The land will not support so many.
We already had to turn others away.
Relatives of these men here.
It is your land.
Not for now, mister.
We all banded together.
We all have a vote.
My people, we fought together to get here.
Some were killed.
You have no idea what it's like out there.
I couldn't abandon them now.
Look, there is a way.
Tell them that it's no good, that you have to find somewhere else,
Tell them that we'll let them camp out there tonight under the trees, and than you and Ann and the children can slip away, and Roger.
I'll be waiting up there tonight for you.
Yes, that might work.
So there it is. 
We have two alternatives.
Go somewhere else or fight our way into Blind Gill.
There is a third alternative.
You and your family could go in.
And Spooks. He doesn't eat much.
And I will stay out here with the others.
Why spoil it for you?
Well, that might give some people the ideal. You know.
That they were just being used.
Right. You're right.
And that's the way I feel.
I agree.
The best thing is to fight our way in.
Daddy, you'll fight Uncle David?
We have to. In there we have
 a chance of surviving. All of us.
I don't know how else we can  protect ourselves.
But understand this all
 of you. I love my brother.
Watch out for him. He looks a bit
 like me and he's got white hair.
I don't want him hurt.
We'll go when it's close to dawn, when they wouldn't be expecting me and my family.
David would have given us up on that.
This river makes pretty good defense.
On the banks it's deep, very fast.
- Any sign of them, David?
- No.
Shot! It's cold.
There's plenty of cows drowned here.Also men.????
We're on this shelf, it runs right along the middle.
We'll have to go further up
 to see the barricade.
- How's the range for you?
- No trouble at all.
If I can stop shaking.
- There's David, the one standing.
- Yes, he has the white hair. Don't worry.
The machine gun first.
You take the machine gun,
I'll try the one on the left.
But don't hit David.
God!
They attack us!
Where they are?
Where the hell are they?
Down there, in the river.
Jesus, I hope it's not John.
Is that you, John?
- You bastard!
- Sorry, Mr. Custance.
They got me.
-They're over the barricade.
-Here they come.
- Parsons! Hold your fire!
- Where is David? we have a machine gun!
We don't want any more killings!
Put down your guns!
They got the machine gun.
God grant peace to the souls of the ones we loved who lie here.
And may He forgive us all for what we have done.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Poor, generous David.
Darling, you mustn’t blame yourself.
I'm not gonna blame Pirrie.
If Pirrie hadn't  killed him, what would I have done?
This motion picture is not a documentary,
but it could be.

Studios, one bedroom and two bedroom apartments are now available from Starko, a division of General
Structures Incorporated.
Good morning. Can I help you?
Yes, we are looking for the rental agent.
- We have an appointment with him.
- I'll just give him a little buzz.
- Do you ever use that?
- This?
No, never had it out of the holster.
A rival company has them, so we've got to have them.
It's just an advertising gimmick.
Mr Merrick is coming.
Welcome to Starliner Towers.
- And you are?
- Kresimer and Benda Sviben.
Ah yes, Mr and Mrs Sviben.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Now, are we talking about one or two bedrooms?
I assume we're not talking about bachelors.
Now, Benda, you take a look at this one and tell me if that doesn't suit you right down to the ground.
This is the one with the big view.
The panoramic view.
- Did you say something, Nick?
- No.
Breakfast is just about ready.
Can I call you at the office?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I don't know.
I just thought I might like to call you.
I'm not going to be at the office, except to sign in.
I've got claims to check out.
Garages and more garages.
We're going up.
Well. I'll just take a little ride.
As I was saying, we have quite an exciting variety of completely furnished apartments ready and waiting.
You could almost move in this afternoon, if you wanted.
Notice how the entranceways to all the apartments...
Annabelle, it's Nick.
Are you in the bedroom?
It's probably nothing at all.
Actually, it's probably some form of fatty cyst or something like that that could easily be removed at the doctor's office.
Hasn't Nick seen a doctor?
He hates doctors.
Doctors and lawyers.
He never goes to doctors.
Look, why don't you do this. Go down to the clinic and see that nice doctor.
What's his name? St. Luc?
Go down to the clinic and explain to him that Nick is very ill and he has to stay in bed.
Ask him to come and see him.
And then when he's there they can fight it out between them.
- He'll be really mad.
- So what?
You can relax. You'll find out what's wrong with him.
Let him be the uptight one for a change.
Really, this is ridiculous.
OK.
Bravo!
Nicholas! I didn't expect you in today.
I've been telling everyone to call back tomorrow.
It was Dr Hobbes who paid the rent on the apartment.
But actually it was her name that appeared on the residency list and on the intercom board.
Annabelle Brown.
A very civilised young lady.
Never complained about anything.
That was her? Annabelle Brown?
Without a doubt.
This is the man who called you up here?
Yes, the doctor, Roger St. Luc.
He's the director of our little medical clinic here.
- Medical clinic?
- Yes. We're on an island, you see.
We have to be as self-supporting as possible.
OK. Let's have a talk to the doctor.
Dr St. Luc?
Dr St. Luc?
Dr St. Luc? Detective
Sergeant Heller, homicide.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- You're the one who found the bodies?
- Yes.
Did you touch or move anything before we arrived?
I removed some surgical tape from the girl's lips.
I examined the inside of her mouth.
I gave the tape to your detective... the man over there with the canvas bag.
And I looked at the abdominal wound.
Yes, well, the department will be getting back to you about that.
Now, you knew these people?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at the university.
I saw the girl around the building.
I didn't know her.
She never came into the clinic.
So you came to visit this man Hobbes, and you found them like that?
No. I haven't seen Dr Hobbes since medical school.
He taught me. He was my professor at university, in urology and venereology.
He also conducted some seminars in psychopharmacology. That's about it.
I never really had any idea he ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
What brought you up here?
He called me at six o'clock this morning.
Hobbes called me.
I thought I was dreaming.
I haven't heard that voice in so long.
He said, "Meet me at apartment 15..."
- Thank you.
"At noon we go out for lunch.
It's time you furthered your education."
How did he sound? Depressed? Nervous?
He sounded fine.
No, you've got the wrong man.
Just a moment please.
Dr St. Luc, it's for you.
Someone wanting to know why didn't you turn up for lunch.
I know it is not the kind of lunch that Hobbes had in mind for us, but it's all I got.
Isn't it beautiful?
This is Hobbes' and my project.
What we were trying to find was an alternative to organ transplant.
Am I keeping you up?
You're bored, right?
To you, organ transplant is just yesterday's kishkas, right?
Look. You've got Man, right?
And you've got parasites that live in, on and around Man. Right?
So, why not breed a parasite that can do something useful?
A parasite that can take over the function of a human organ.
For example, you breed a parasite that you implant in the human body cavity.
It hooks around the circulatory system and it filters the blood just like a kidney does.
It takes a little blood for itself once in a while. What do you care?
You've got enough.
You can afford to be generous.
- Huh? Are you following me?
- I am, I am.
Look, you've got a guy with a bad kidney. Right?
You put the bug in him.
The bug goes to work on the kidney, dissolves it, so the body assimilates it.
Now, what have you got?
You've got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney.
Right? I know you're going to say.
You're going to say it's crazy.
Actually, I was going to ask if you have any mustard.
Come on Roger, really.
What do you think?
- I think it's crazy.
- It's crazy, but who cares?
I mean, look, Hobbes was a lousy teacher.
We've got to face the facts of life.
He was dull, academic, just plain lousy, but he had a genius for one thing... that was getting grants.
He could raise money for crazy projects.
For example, who do you suppose is paying the rent on this place?
- Not you.
- No.
The Northern Hemisphere
Organ Transplant Society.
That's for something that's supposed to put them out of business.
Here is a partial list of some of the other research projects that we are underwriting, but with their money. Smart?
Ashen and Gaunt Insurance Appraisals.
Mr Tudor?
One moment, please. I'll buzz him.
Nicholas? There's a call for you.
It's that man whose Lamborghini caught fire on St Catherine.
He's very angry.
Nicholas? What's wrong?
We're going to get you to a hospital.
It's probably an ulcer.
- I'm going home for the day.
- But Nicholas...
I'm all right, Mona.
Call me a cab... Now.
All right, Nicholas. All right.
How did Hobbes know this girl?
Who is she?
Some chick he met while he was lecturing at a girls' school.
And what happened?
They caught him examining her titties for breast cancer in the faculty lounge.
She was 12 years old.
Talk about crazy.
He used to bring her up here once in a while.
I'll never understand how he could do what he did to her.
Well, I think I'm going to have to go back and open up the store.
It's been great seeing you.
Roger?
You'll think about what I just talked to you about? About joining me on this?
- Sure.
- See you. Right.
How about the pickle?
It's used!
Good afternoon, Mr Tudor!
...that the ageing process is in any way reversible.
I don't think for a moment that it is, but it might be stoppable, and that's where mega-vitamins come in.
Mrs Tudor? Are you ready now?
- Yes. Excuse me, Brad.
- Sure.
- Be with you in a minute.
- Right.
No, I don't see any change in this company report I did on your husband last year.
I see a few too many escargots and too many crepes with vanilla ice-cream and strawberries and a dash of Grand Marnier.
I don't see any chance of any cancer developing. Not like you're describing.
I think it might be some swollen glands or something.
Can you come up and take a look at him?
That's what I'm here for.
I don't think I can do it until about
9:30 or 10 o'clock. Is that OK?
- That's terrific.
- Not too late?
That's fine.
Thank you so much, doctor.
- Don't worry about it.
- OK.
Mrs Emmenthal is ready, doctor.
Tell Mrs Emmenthal I'll be right with her, will you?
- You see how beautiful the grass is?
- Yes.
I take a walk nearly every day.
Good heavens! Look!
Oh, poor birdie.
They're always crashing into tall buildings.
The windows fool them, you know.
- Come along, Olive.
- It's such a shame.
- Come along, dear.
- The poor little bird.
Maybe it's only hurt.
Don't be silly, dear.
It's in heaven now, whatever it is.
Now come along. I'll get you tucked into bed before the colour TV.
You know what a restless...
Kriedler seemed to think that the mega-vitamin therapy is the answer to the question of ageing.
That's not to suggest that the ageing process is in any way reversible.
- They're ready for you now, Brad.
- OK. Bye.
Now, you just take your shirt off and the doctor will be in to see you in a minute, OK?
You don't have to go. I'm not shy.
Now, don't be a tease, Brad.
- I'm still working, you know.
- Yes, I know.
Looking good. Put your feet up.
Let's see what the problem is.
Ow! Better take it easy.
There's a lot of pressure in there.
Do you want me to breathe deeply?
Not just yet. Just breathe normally.
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Yes.
Better than me, my man.
Better than me.
Erm... Mr Parkins, I understand that you got these lumps from a young lady.
Is that right?
What makes you think that?
She had some just like them.
Right here. Near her belly button.
You could push them around too.
I thought it was kind of sexy, myself.
- Did she live in the Starliner Tower?
- Yes. In 1511.
- Annabelle Brown?
- Yeah, that's the one.
OK, I tell you what, put your clothes on.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to take a few X-rays.
I'm going to give you a little piece of paper,
- right here with the address.
- Are they going to cut me open?
I don't want you thinking you've got a problem when you don't.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Want a drink?
- No thanks.
I just wanted to tell you, Dr St.
Luc is going to come and see Nick about 10:00.
That's terrific! Was he nice to you?
- Mm-hm.
- Great.
After you've found out that there's nothing that a vacation won't cure why don't you come and join me for dinner.
Everything from Filipe's.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
Why don't you come and join me?
I loathe to eat alone.
It makes me feel so fat and lonely.
- I always order for two.
- OK.
Nick? Are you home?
Come on, sweetheart. We'll get you into bed. You'll be all right.
Come on.
Come on.
You go there and I'll go here.
Forget it.
I don't understand why there's no-one home here.
Maybe in that apartment.
What is it?
It's sickening! What is it?
Let's get out of here!
Come on, boy.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, fella.
You and me.
You and me, we're going to be good friends.
Good friends.
Atta boy!
Nick? Did you call me?
Did you say something?
How are you feeling?
Does your stomach hurt?
- Can I feel those lumps on your tum?
- Go away.
Leave me alone.
Why won't you let me help you?
The time is seven o'clock.
This is John Woodhouse with
Mediascope news, sports and weather.
A bizarre murder-suicide has
Montreal police baffled today as they attempt to untangle events leading to the discovery of two bodies in the Starliner Island apartment complex, early this afternoon.
The body of a 68 year old retired professor of medicine was found lying in a pool of blood by an unidentified former student.
The professor apparently committed suicide by cutting his throat with a scalpel after performing an as yet unexplained operation on a 19 year old woman.
The woman's nude body was found lying on the dining room table. Badly mutilated.
Police are not releasing any names pending notification of next of kin.
On the labour front, talk of an impending steelworkers strike has the municipal officials on the defensive.
Spokesmen for the steelworkers union are asking for a 20% pay increase.
A government official says negotiations with the union will continue until a settlement is reached.
Olympic construction has been suspended for two weeks...
I got those things you asked for.
The files on Horsfield, Velakofsky,
Swinbird and Brown.
And those papers published by Hobbes and...
Those are from the American
Journal of Psychiatry.
- All of this.
- Yes, this is Hobbes' paper.
As an extra, these are some things that were compiled before your time here. I thought they might be of interest to you.
And now how about a kiss?
- Hey, how about a kiss?
- Sure.
That's the best thing I heard all day!
How about another kiss?
- Do we have more people on the list?
- No, Dot is the last.
- Yes?
- Rog? It's me, Rollo.
Interesting you should call.
I'm just looking over this material you did with Hobbes. It's interesting.
That's flattering but I don't think you'll find much real meat on them.
- No? How come?
- I always thought Hobbes was funny,
But I told you that before. Right?
I just never knew how funny, until now.
So when he kicked off, they sent all his personal notes and stuff.
After all, I'm his partner, right?
Anyhow, I've been going through his papers and what it adds up to is this:
Hobbes was shafting us all.
Me, the university, the foundations, the council, everybody.
- I don't quite get it.
- Hobbes believed that "man is an animal
"that thinks too much.
An over rational animal
"that has lost touch with its body and its instincts." How do you like that?
In other words, too much brain and not enough guts.
So what he came up with to help our guts along was a parasite that's... a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will hopefully turn the world into one beautiful, mindless orgy.
Well, I think it sounds a little crazy to me.
Look. The important thing to you, Rog, is this.
You know Annabelle? Well, he was using her as a guinea pig.
- A guinea pig?
- He implanted her with a parasite, and once it took over, apparently she went berserk.
I guess Hobbes wasn't ready for that,
- so I guess he just had to kill her.
- What was the point?
Well, the point was... he wasn't trying to burn her.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He was trying to burn the things. All of them.
- Yeah, well, he didn't make it.
- What?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know, but Annabelle Brown was a popular girl around Starliner Towers.
I've got three men here, maybe four, hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify.
Listen, I'd like to come over and take a look at those guys.
Well, why don't you?
I'm going to meet one of them soon.
A fellow by the name of Tudor.
It's on the directory there.
You can just meet me up at the apartment.
Yeah, look, I'll be right over.
Listen, Rog, I don't want to panic you or anything, but the way Hobbes designed those things, they get out of hand pretty fast.
So you've got to be careful, before you even have a chance to know what's happening to you.
Once they start pumping that juice into the blood stream, well, I don't know...
The point it, if you see anybody doing anything compulsive, you know, any kind of bizarre sexual things, well... once we can get at them, there are a lot of things we can use.
Maybe we'd start with a kind of basic tropical kit and work up from there.
I'll bring a bag full over, but the point is, you've got to get at them. And fast.
Listen, I'm going to stay. I've got to meet Rollo at the Tudor apartment.
- It's going to be pretty late.
- Why don't you come to my place for something to eat when you're finished?
It's going to be very late...
It doesn't matter to me how late it is. I'll keep it warm.
Is anything wrong?
I mean, with the Hobbes thing?
Yeah. But nothing we can't handle.
Well, how about supper at my place?
- OK, but late.
- OK. See you later.
Delivery for 416, from Filipe's restaurant.
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry for love!
Mm-hm. OK...
Hot!
Pretty good.
It's lovely!
Yes? Can I help you?
Yes, you can help me.
Wait a minute...
- What's wrong?
- This man, I think I recognise him.
I think he lives in the apartment house.
He just attacked me for no reason at all.
- It's all right.
- I opened the door.
I was fixing your dinner.
He grabbed me and tried to kiss me.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know. I think I killed him.
I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Just stay here and I'll go and check it out.
- Just stay here.
- No, no.
I'm not going to stay here by myself, I'm going with you.
Listen to me. It'll be safe for you here.
Just stay here and I'll be right back.
OK?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
I just couldn't let your dinner burn.
It's strange!
Go away!
Get it off me!
Get off!
Get away from me.
Yes, Gunther, how many times do I have to tell you, yes!
Sometimes, Gunther, I wonder if I should try to get along on my own
- and not owe you anything.
- Don't be that way.
You're always helping me Gunther but you don't miss the chance to remind me...
Now, I want you to describe him to the doorman.
Maybe he'll know who he is or where he lives, and his apartment.
- How are you feeling?
- OK.
Hey, doctor, please help us.
- What happened?
- Please pardon me.
I am Maurice Guilbault.
I am a resident here.
We were walking in the hallway and Doris my wife,
- she was attacked by this thing.
- Where is this thing?
I hit it! Then, I hit it with the cane, down to the garbage.
This is a nurse.
This is Nurse Forsythe.
She is a nurse. She is a nurse.
Take them back to their apartment.
Treat her for second degree burns.
- What is the number of your apartment?
- Yes, we live in 703.
I'll meet you back there.
Don't leave until I get there.
Look the door. Don't let anyone in except me. OK?
- But where are you going?
- Down to the garbage.
No, dear, it's not our floor.
The Savlon, does that make it feel any better?
Janine?
Janine?
Nick? Are you up?
Hello, Darling! I feel wonderful.
Come here. Come and join me on the bed.
You're absolutely beautiful.
Your eyes! Your mouth!
You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive.
Do you want to make love?
Nick, you're so strange.
You'll make love to me, won't you, Janine?
You're my wife.
You start it. I think
I've forgotten how to.
- Nick, I can't take this.
- Janine.
Make love to me, Janine!
You're my wife!
Ah!
No! Nick! Stop!
Please stop!
Make love to me.
I want to be able to see us when we make love.
I want to put my contacts in.
Is that OK, Nick?
I'm going to put my contacts in.
Nick, I'm here.
Betts?
Come on.
Faster!
I'm going to call the police.
She's calling the police!
She's calling the police!
Je ne sais pas!
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
What's going on?
Hey, miss! Nurse, come back!
My wife, she needs something!
Roger?
Roger?
Roger...
Roger, where are you?
Roger...
Doctor! You look awful.
What happened?
Never mind how awful I look.
Here's what I want you to do.
Call the police. You got that?
Call them and tell them the head of the medical centre needs help.
Listen to me!
Tell them I need help and to make it fast. Right away.
OK.
- Yes? Who is there?
- Mr Guilbault.
- Who is this?
- Dr St. Luc.
I need to talk to the nurse, please.
The nurse? She went away. I think she went to look for you, doctor.
- You stay where you are, all right?
- Stay where we are?
- Understand? Stay where you are.
- Yes, OK. Goodbye.
Who are those people?
My God!
Go away! Leave us alone!
No!
Forsythe?
Hold on while I try and crash through the door.
Dr St. Luc?
Oh, here he is.
Ah, good evening,
Mr Wolfe, Miss Lewis.
Mr Merrick, why don't you do something about all that noise?
We like parties, but this is ridiculous!
Well, there might be a connection.
You see, it's about your locker...
I'm afraid somebody broke into it earlier in the evening.
- Oh, what a drag!
- Are you serious?
I'm afraid so.
I have some of the things that they were throwing around in my office.
If you'd care to come and identify them...
What's going on? Let's get out.
Baby...
Do I feel good to you?
Yes, very good.
Do you know what I want?
I want you to make love with me.
Make love to me, Janine.
- You can't...
- Make love to me.
- You can't be saying that.
- Let's kiss and make up, baby.
Make love to me, make love to me.
Let's kiss and make up!
Rollo and the police will be here by now.
So all we have to do is avoid these people till they find us or we find them.
Dr St. Luc?
Dr St. Luc?
Roger?
Dr Linsky here!
Roger, Rollo here to have that consultation we talked about.
Roger?
Hey, Rog?
Mr Tudor?
Mr Tudor, I'm Dr Linsky.
Mr Tudor?
All right...
Ah!
Help! Roger!
- No.
- Take if off!
No... No! Tudor!
Roger, I had a very disturbing dream last night.
In this dream, I found myself making love to a strange man.
Only, I'm having trouble, you see, because he's old, and dying.
He smells bad and I find him repulsive.
But then he tells me that everything is erotic.
That everything is sexual.
You know what I mean?
He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh.
That disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other.
That even dying is an act of eroticism.
That talking is sexual.
That breathing is sexual.
That even to physically exist is sexual.
And I believe him.
And we make love beautifully.
Go back!
Hey, come on out!
Do you want to go to a party?
Hey, come on out.
Have you met my daughter, Erica?
She's a beautiful girl.
Come here, Erica.
I think you'd really like my daughter, Erica.
The time is 5:26am.
This is Gerald Keys with the
Mediascope sunrise news bulletin.
There is still no confirmation by Montreal City Police concerning alleged reports of a city wide wave of violent sexual assaults.
The assaults, believed to have originated in the vicinity of Starliner
Island, began late last night, and have spread with increasing frequency this morning.
Reports of the attacks have been termed irresponsible and hysterical by a Montreal City Police spokesman.
Stay tuned for further details on Mediascope News at 6.00.
NARRATOR:
A time of beginnings.
Of darkness.
Of light.
Of the sun.
The earth.
The sea.
Of man.
The beginnings of man living with man.
By the sea.
In the mountains.
The beginnings of love, hate and fear.
Man's fear of the unknown.
Man's fear lest the sun should leave him.
Leave him alone in everlasting darkness.
A time when the color of a woman's hair condemned her for sacrifice to the sun.
A time when there was, as yet, no moon.

[ENGLISH SDH]
The world blew up
in a thousand atomic fireballs.
The first blast was set off
by five terrorists.
It took two million years...
for some of the radioactive clouds
to allow some sun in.
By then, only a handful
of humans survived.
The rest of humanity had
changed into hideous mutants.
These mutant species
floundered in the bad areas...
radioactive lands that never allowed
them to become human again...
and made each birth a new disaster.
Then, in the good lands...
they came back,
arising from their long sleep...
fairies, elves, dwarves...
the true ancestors of man.
They lived happily in the good areas.
It was a big day in Montagar.
Delia, queen of the fairies...
was presiding over the feast of plenty...
celebrating 3,000 years of peace.
In the midst of the celebration...
Delia felt a pull from the skies.
She looked up
and saw dark clouds...
forming on the horizon in every direction.
She fell into a trance
and left the party...
heading for her home on a high hill.
At first, the fairies were puzzled.
But then they too felt
a force drawing them to follow.
Delia was alone inside.
The storm grew until
it was a raging cyclone...
hovering over the dwelling.
One of the older fairies
ventured inside the house.
There lay Delia on her bed...
holding a pair of twins in her arms.
The older fairy instantly knew that...
these were not ordinary twins,
but magical wizards.
The baby wizards were
polarized like magnets...
one attracting with a magnetic draw...
the other repelling
and impossible to get near.
Avatar, the kind and good wizard...
spent much of his boyhood...
entertaining his mother
with beautiful visions.
Blackwolf, the mutant wizard...
would never visit his mother...
and spent his time
torturing small animals.
More years passed,
and Delia continued to slip.
Finally, all life drained out of her...
and Avatar held her hand
trying desperately to use
his magic to restore her.
He cradled her in his arms and wept.
When Blackwolf found that
his mother had died, he was excited...
for now he felt he would take over
her leadership and rule the land.
When Avatar confronted
Blackwolf, he was enraged.
They began a furious battle.
Each using his magic, they continued...
until they had nearly destroyed each other.
But Avatar's magic was stronger...
because he had the emotional loss
of his mother that drove him on.
Blackwolf was defeated.
"The day will come, my brother,
when I will return...
and make this a planet
where mutants rule. "
Blackwolfheaded off,
leaving Avatar very disturbed.
The time has come.
Kill!
Well, hello, handsome.
Hello, honey.
He is called Necron 99.
He is one of Blackwolf's assassins.
He travels the land destroying
the believers of magic.
 "My children,
the only true technology is nature.
"All the other forms
of manmade technology...
"are perversions.
"The ancient dictators used technology... to enslave the masses."
- Weehawk, can't we stay here for tonight?
- No.
Just for a few hours' rest.
- I sense something.
- But the road is clear.
We haven't seen an assassin for days.
A clever assassin stays hidden.
Avatar must be warned.
Our mission is nearly over, Westwind... but now it's time for one final run.
Damn it!
- Well?
- They're not back yet, my president.
- They're really late now, aren't they, old wizard?
Bad magic, isn't it?
And if they don't show... you'll know no more than you did before.
- How true, fairy goddess of the New World... but if they don't show...
I think that will tell us something too.
Damn it, Avatar! If there's any danger... maybe we should... maybe we should arm our states.
- Science and technology?
- There's no time for that.
Even if we could impress our people with the danger... science and technology were outlawed... millions of years ago... and, we must admit... it's been a peaceful world since then.
Enough, Wizard!
I demand to know what you know...
- or I'll banish you!
Banish him?
But, Father, who will teach me... all the magic I've left to learn?
Only Avatar can make me... a full-fledged fairy.
As you can see, I'm only half there.
All right. All right.
I'll tell you... if you think you can handle it.
What do you know
about war, about bombs...
that could turn
a planet molten and liquid?
To think it could start again... ten million years after the final one.
Sometimes I get tired of being so old.
Sometimes... being a wizard is lonely at the top.
We're waiting, old, old wizard.
You know about my brother.
Well, as the years passed...
I searched for my brother in vain.
He had settled in the dark land of Scortch...
where people still died of radiation.
 For 5,000 years,
Blackwolf studied black arts...
increasing his wisdom 10,000-fold.
He built a small following
of frog-like creatures...
but needed more troops
for his evil plans.
He then formed an army
whose generals were called up...
from the black shadows of hell.
Souls who waited for untold eternities
for a new leader...
Blackwolf's tremendous power...
enslaved them all to carry out his will.
Then stories of Blackwolf's armies...
attacking neighboring countries came back.
Demons of hell armed with black magic...
but they would get bored...
or sidetracked in the middle of battle...
and give up, running home.
Fritz! Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Those despicable, animal warmongers!
They've killed Fritz!
Take that! Take this!
Take that, you green slime!
- You black-hearted, short bow-legged...
- Max!
Max, I'm okay! I'm okay, Max.
Just a scratch.
- Look, I'm all right.
- Oh. Oh, damn.
There you go again stepping on my lines... raining on my parade, costing me medals.
Oh, damn!
Ohh. Oh, Fritz?
Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz!
They could easily have won,
but they lacked...
the motivation and inspiration.
Blackwolfknew he needed more.
He sent his huge armies out
to excavate ancient ruins...
for links to the past.
Tales reached Avatar that bits and pieces
of pre-holocaust technology...
were being dug up and marched
back to Scortch I.
With these ancient pieces...
he built a new war machine.
Still, his generals
needed more to fight with.
This drove Blackwolf mad with frustration.
Then one day, that frustration vanished.
I sent my elf spies to find out what was happening.
I'm sure he has found some great power... that will control his armies.
You mean you sent out that elf envoy... to investigate based on a vague feeling of your...
I've failed you, my wizard.
I've failed you, my president.
What news do you bring?
The lights went out! The lights went out!
Necron 99 has destroyed himself.
It's done!
With the assassination of the presidents of the free states... comes their fall... and that of my brother.
It's done.
We have four more lights left, sir... four more.
It's not important!
The main exterminations are complete.
The remaining countries are now ruled...
by second-rate incompetents...
so confused...
that even now they blame the killings...
on those within their own ranks.
It's time to strike!
Sieg heil.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, lard bottom.
- Get up. Blackwolf's callin'.
- I don't want to go.
Hey, when Blackwolf calls, we go.
- I don't want to fight anymore.
- Ya gotta.
- I don't want to hurt things anymore.
- Hey, you're so stupid.
Listen, I ain't stupid. Just listen.
You know what I mean, trees, birds, butterflies...
Everything's got a right to live. You know what I mean?
- Hey...
- Everything! Everything's got a right to live.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Butterflies...
Blackwolf's got a secret weapon that makes us invincible.
We can't lose.
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left. Right, left...
It will never work.
People don't want war.
It destroyed this planet, its people... and all records of past civilizations.
Not all records, as you'll soon find out.
Attention!
Leaders of tomorrow's master race!
The time has come, as I promised...
a time when I reveal to you... my loyal followers...
the ancient secret of war... the key to creating hysteria... fear... gods.
Behold!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Blackmark's army's come again!
Our cousin elves are already in the trenches.
It's our loved land too.
For Elfin and Fairyland, united we fly.
Hey, Elfie, do you hear those drums?
Sure do, Peewhittle.
I don't believe those blokes are gonna try it again.
I'm scared.
Now don't be, governor.
You're too young to remember... but Blackwolf must have lost one million men here... last time he tried to invade.
And if Blackwolf's
stupid enough to try it again...
he'll lose twice more.
Them goblins and demons... just look mean, but they're yellow.
They got no cause to fight.
They always give up and run
with our arrows chasing them...
all the way home.
It's always been that way and will always be the same.
Ain't that the truth, boys?
Weehawk, what's that
old wizard been doing for four hours?
If he's looking for answers from that assassin... my father's sword can get it quicker than brain reading.
Cool down.
Cool down.
I got it, and it ain't good.
The key is a dream machine... that inspires armies with ancient war images.
It must be destroyed.
It is in Blackwolf's castle in the land of Scortch.
When do we leave?
Leave?
What do you mean, leave?
You got to be kidding.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
Just wake me up when the planet's destroyed.
- Well, I'm not too old. I'll go myself.
- Very noble.
We're going.
I must avenge my father's death.
It ain't no fairyland out there, kid.
But all right, all right.
I was just testing you.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, what now?
Uh, I don't know.
Oh, why don't you sit there for a couple hours while I figure it out?
Okay.
- Uh, Avatar.
- All right. All right.
How do we find this machine?
This creature, uh,
I shall call him Peace.
Peace?
In the hopes that he will bring it.
He's somehow wired to the machine.
And the only freedom he'll ever have from its painful grip... is in its destruction.
Go now, both of you, and prepare for the journey.
- I'll reason with him when he awakens.
- Avatar, you're not that old.
She's gotta be kiddin'.
Looks like my brother and I now begin our final battle.
Weehawk spent a night
saying good-bye to his tribe...
asking them to protect his family...
and to name a new chief
ifhe did not return.
Elinore said good-bye to her father
and then the other fairies of her kind.
She told them she will return
as queen of Montagar...
her father's death revenged...
and herself a full-fledged fairy.
Well, they're here, nut.
I'll be right down, heroes.
All right, creep.
Now, before I untie you...
I wanna tell you a couple things.
And I want you to listen and listen carefully.
This has been the biggest bummer of a trip I've ever been on.
If you let me down or you hurt my friends...
especially the broad...
I got stuff planned for you...
- that'll take 20 years to kill you.
- No pain.
And you'll be screaming for mercy
in the first five seconds.
Peace wants love... wants free, will help.
Look, just get us there, you got it?
Don't be sad,
Elinore.
I'll kill that monster as soon as he shows us that projector.
Are you kids ready?
You know, this Peace here,
he knows every step towards Scortch.
I promised him life without pain... uh, life without fear...
- I still don't trust him.
- H-Hey.
You're both forgetting you have the protection of a powerful wizard here.
Damn it.
He's getting older but not much bolder.
I wonder if I packed my scotch.
Sing us a song, Elinore.
I don't want to.
But that's why we brought you. Come on.
Where's daddy? What is he doing?
He's guarding our home, son.
There's been a war, and this land has lost.
Why can't we fight and win, Mommy?
Because they have
weapons and technology.
Wejust have love.
Hey, Louie, What are we gonna do with the prisoners?
How do I know?
They're findin' out right now.
Duuuhhh.
What is this place?
- Dumbo, it's religion, man.
Ain't you heard?
- Religion?
Yeah. Blackwolf says the responsibilities of the prisoners... is up to the priests inside.
Now, what we got to do, dumbo... is reconnoiter the priests and find out.
What is all this?
Bits and pieces of religion, man.
What's the matter
with you?
Holy objects they saved
for millions of years, man.
- What are we looking for?
- Hey, so dumb.
We're looking for the priests, man, the priests.
Why?
I don't know.
I guess because you need
God on your side, stupid.
Who's that?
Who's that?
- That's them. Them. Them.
- Who's that?
Uh, listen, you guys.
We hates to interrupt you, you know.
- We're sorry.
- Yeah. But, uh, you see, Blackwolf...
- you know, our führer...
- It wasn't our fault.
Uh, shut up, will you?
Blackwolf, the führer,
started this war, see.
We got all these prisoners
we don't want to feed...
We ain't got time for that.
Wejust got time for war.
So, we were, uh...
I want to ask you guys...
He's asking you, not me.
Yeah, I'm asking if you want
to take care of'em, it's okay with us.
- Me too. Me too.
- Yeah, see?
- Yeah. Okay, dumbo.
- Okay.
- My sons, you say you are the victors.
- Uh-huh.
- But there is only one victor.
- Mmm.
That's Him.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Patience.
- We must first observe sundown and pray.
- He's got a point.
Hear us, O Lord. Hear our petition.
O Lord, we cry out to you.
Lord, hear our prayer.
Hear the prayers of thy humble servants.
O Lord, God, Lord, God... do not fail us in our hour of need.
We need you, O Lord.
We cry to you, O Lord.
Lord, help us.
Help us, O Lord.
We need you. We cry to you.
We cry out to you!
Hey, enough already.
O Lord, God, Lord, God.
All right, it's been five hours.
Time's up.
Okay, Charlie. It's no good.
- Put plan "A" to work.
- It's about time.
Okay, babe. They ain't gonna talk.
- Gimme plan "B".
- Hey, what's plan "B"?
Hey, hey, hey. Watch.
Will the birth be soon?
Very soon, my Lord.
You're young to be queen.
But deliver me a son...
and you shall help me rule this planet.
I don't want to rule this planet, my Lord.
- Just our kingdom is enough.
- Enough?
Enough for mutants to stay in their place, huh?
Live with radiation so our bodies crawl with hell?
We will live in the good lands.
My son will grow where there isn't death... in the very waters we drink and the air we breathe.
Wise men... will my son be human or mutant?
Mutant, the charts say, my Lord.
The next one won't be.
Do not have it killed, Oh, Lord!
It is not his fault!
Wait a minute, Avatar.
Peace is taking us towards the mountain fairies' domain.
We should go around.
Avatar, why is Peace stopping?
Fairy bad.
Not good. Go around.
Coming from Mr. Nice guy here... those fairies must be something else.
Go on, nut. We'd lose time.
Bad fairies.
Elves and fairies are bad-blood cousins.
I'm not in the mood for their pranks.
They may have useful information.
Don't worry. Time has passed.
Much of the rivalry between fairy and elf has subsided.
Barbarians.
Gee, they're adorable.
Oh. Hey!
# Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha #
Holy chrome!
Oh. Hey.
By my sword, that is no way to treat a lady.
Hey! Oh!
Stop this childish display.
Why, even at elves' houses,
I've seen more sophisticated magic.
All right. All right. You've had it.
This is Avatar the Great you're fooling with.
Avatar, consul and wizard of your great-grandfathers' consuls...
who was turned into Avatar the Old.
Yeah, that's me...
Avatar the Old now... but I still got my powers.
And you've cost me my patience.
I call upon all forces of darkness.
Oh, winds of abysses howling through the stars...
and eons of centuries.
O Lords of the Whirlwind,
black, gray and white...
I call upon you.
Oh, ever-increasing darkness...
shapeless and mindless beings...
corroded and rotten
in your hearts, body and mind...
I summon you from your ancient, timeless travels... to ride the winds of blackness.
And cabash!
Please accept our apologies for the behavior of some our more carefree brothers.
I'm Sean, leader of the Knights of Stardust... protectors of Dolan, king of the mountain fairies.
We have prepared a feast to welcome you to our humble domain.
Listen here, you little winged squirt.
- Do you realize...
- Oh, Avatar, stop being so grumpy.
Oh... I... Hey, Oh...
Ohh.
All right. Okay. Okay.
I'm Avatar the Great, as you've heard.
Now, this here is Elinore, queen of Montagar.
What brings you here?
Oh, we're on a quest
to the land of Scortch.
 You're heading for Scortch?
I'm afraid you're in for trouble.
Will you tell us what you know?
Steady, Westwind.
We'll eat alone, lest we sit with fools.
Meecher, where's Peace?
- Arise, you fools!
- Hey, what's that?
Assassin! Technology...
By the soul of Dulac and Rackham!
- Elinore is gone!
- It was Peace!
I knew we should have killed him when we had the chance!
Never mind. We must find Elinore.
The fairies have taken her into the mountain.
Hey, there's no time to waste.
No one's ever been to the fairy sanctuary before.
- It's forbidden to all.
- Drums.
It begins.
Quickly now, or all is lost.
You must save Elinore. Hurry, old fool.
Morro crinkle frizetta.
Enough magic, old man. Run!
Very bad. Not good. Not good.
Destroy her! She's party to death!
Sean is dead! Killed by lies and human technology.
Will it be brother against brother here too?
Only humans kill their own kind.
She allowed technology and death... into the Golden Circle.
She is a traitor.
Traitor?
You fools, release me.
Stay back!
As the king's guards... we can't allow you near until the king has ruled.
No one rules over Elinore of Montagar.
We rule.
We rule over death, lies, and deceit.
We rule.
She's emoting. I feel her pain.
It hurts! It hurts!
Wow!
Avatar never told me
I had full fairy powers.
He said I wasn't ready yet.
I told you, she's dangerous.
Destroy her while there's still time.
I say destroy her, king's rule or not.
Now why'd you want to go and do that for, love?
It's hard enough controlling them as it is.
Release me, or I, Elinore, shall show all you ants something.
- Stop him, miss. Stop him!
- Oh, did I do that?
Stop! I command you to cease.
Okay. Leave everyone alone.
I say, miss, you better stop him.
I think it would be better if you released me and we all ran away.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Holy chrome.
Elinore's really gone and done it.
It's all a disaster.
Well, old man, what are you going to do about it?
You better hurry, miss.
Avatar the Great...
- coming.
- Avatar!
Yeah.
You can kill me now, I'm sure.
I've given myself to you.
- I make no attempt to save myself.
- Save yourself?
Save yourself? Save me!
I can't, Elinore.
The only one who could might be the king here.
My mission, O Lord, is to save the world from another holocaust.
Sean was killed not by us,
but by my brother's assassins...
who have been sent to kill
Weehawk, Elinore...
Peace, and myself
before we reach Scortch.
For all I know and fear,
Weehawk is dead.
So might be Peace.
I ask for permission to take the girl and myself... to try to complete our mission alone...
though it does seem doomed now.
I will not allow you to hurt Elinore... without a fight by myself.
My brother lies, my good King!
Avatar! Avatar!
What will it be, King?
Time's getting short.
Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit?
We have been sent death... images and humans... each with a different story.
Something happening here.
Not you, please. Oh, no.
I have always been very good... and could even be better sometimes.
It starts again.
The only act that has been real so far... is the fact that Avatar did not break his word.
When the arrow struck him, he did not fight back.
And from what we all heard
about Avatar's power...
- that is surely the sign of truth.
We will neither join nor hinder nor help these two.
We will wait and see.
That is our decision.
Well, we're out of there.
Ouch!
Thanks.
I forgot about that.
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, no. Let me help you.
How's that?
It's very pretty, Avatar.
Yeah, well, it could be warmer.
We might as well begin.
This is the way, I think.
Scortch lies somewhere over these mountains.
Well, good morning.
Cozy morning, huh?
Avatar, we're trapped.
It's nothing a little
hard work won't cure.
Here. Follow me, Snow Queen.
I'm so cold, so cold.
Is it much farther?
Elinore, we've rested long enough.
We'd better move on.
Just a little while longer, Avatar.
I'm so tired.
Well, okay.
I'll go over and see if I can see a pass or a path or a... or a house or... something.
Oh, my God.
They're our own tracks.
We've been moving in circles.
I better not tell Elinore.
It'll do her no good.
Avatar, riders!
Run! Assassins come to finish the job!
We'll cut their throats.
Let them come.
Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch.
They split up.
Going to come at us from each end.
- Avatar, we really tried, didn't we?
- Yes, Elinore.
That's all anyone really could have done.
Steady.
Here they come.
Braxis plaxis traxis!
Montagar forever.
Death, assassins!
Peace! Peace, we found them!
We found them!
What took you so long?
Quickly, Peace. Quickly.
Let's get them off this glacier.
The quest is saved.
 The night
was spent in the protection of a cave.
Elinore and Weehawk slept as
Avatar counseled with Peace...
on the quickest route to Scortch.
The journey took them past the ruins...
of ancient civilizations.
Strange beasts lurked about...
but the dangerous mutants
that lived there were gone...
gone to Blackwolf's army.
All they left were their wives,
hurling insults and rocks...
as the party passed through.
Then finally, the desert.
Yeah, I feel it too.
Please do not attempt to draw your gun.
Avatar, you old fool! You've come!
Oh!
Our father's returned.
Avatar... fighter!
Avatar... father, mother, freedom!
Love, life!
We've been camping in the desert... away from prying eyes.
- Where did you get the guns, Abdul?
- Guns!
Well, we got them from old Blackwolf himself.
You mean you joined with...
No, no.
We ambushed a wolf patrol... took everything except their women... and two days from now, we attack Scortch I.
What do you mean, attack?
The remaining elves of the free world... have joined under my banner.
That banner will be carried to Scortch I.
Join us, old wizard.
We desperately need you.
Is this how you're repayin' me?
Stand back.
Avatar will not be touched.
When our world was young, so was mighty Avatar.
Misty moons ago...
he strode this planet like a messiah...
curing radiation sickness
from man and bird...
cleaning the planet of its filth.
It was Avatar who fought alongside my father... against the first mutant attack.
So now we have our messiah back again.
He's going to destroy
his brother for us.
With what?
A woman-child, one elf... and a moron robot.
Oh, Avatar.
- What is it?
- It's Blackwolf.
He's trying to gain control.
Back! Back!
Back to hell!
You can't have him!
You did it.
You beat the demon.
What's happened?
Well, I suddenly felt very sorry for Peace... so I went over to him, and I took his hand and I tried to comfort him.
Peace is in constant mental battle with Blackwolf.
Your kind words took his mind off the battle.
It allowed Blackwolf his chance.
Avatar. What's that?
Trapped.
- Jump, Peace!
- Jump, Peace!
Elinore!
Elinore!
Ah, I don't know.
I just don't know.
I don't know what happened to Elinore.
Betrayal of Elinore to the quest has broken his heart.
There is nothing wrong with him.
Tomorrow morning, the attack begins.
- Avatar, we have to go now.
- Oh, whatever.
The cliffs of Scortch can be seen.
- We have to go now to complete our mission.
- Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- How?
- We have to swim in.
Oh. Okay.
What's happened to the world?
I don't know.
I can remember back...
All the fairies were so good...
We're here. Scortch.
Chrome!
Come. We'll walk right up the road... and no one will expect it.
- We'll act like slaves.
- Yeah.
The castle. I see it.
It's quite a distance.
I had one where the whole country would disappear for a day.
Ohh.
That was, uh...
That was really, uh...
I just don't know.
Over there.
That must be the entrance... to the lower cities.
Now, guards might be about. Come on.
Hmm. How ugly.
How ugly. Kapow!
Boom. Boom.
I just don't know.
Maybe... Maybe I should make a deal with them.
Chrome.
Which way? I don't know.
You know, I should have stayed with them.
- They love magic.
- Shh.
- Avatar, just stay quiet.
- Yeah. Oh.
Psst. Hey, General.
Want to buy an elf hat? Elf beard?
Souvenirs for sale.
Precious souvenirs for sale.
- Get them while they're still hot.
- No more wars, you fools... love.
Scortch can be beautiful too.
Look, look. Real, beautiful presents.
Now, that-that... that is a wonderful trick.
- Wonderful.
- It's Avatar. Oh, General.
It's him. It's bad.
It's come to hurt the führer.
Kill it.
Oh, master, kill it.
That's impossible.
That dirty old man is Avatar the Great?
If that is so... then I am a warthog's uncle!
Funny you should say that.
Kiyah!
Ki-Kiyah!
Oooowah!
The enemy is dead.
Oh, master, the enemy is dead.
My God! What have I done?
Master loves Larry.
Master feeds Larry.
What are elves good for?
Avatar, good luck!
The beast has shown us the way to the castle.
I'm sorry, Weehawk.
I'm just an old fool.
You know... the world owes you much, kid... even if we don't take another step.
God! Avatar, get down.
I've seen him.
You can't beat him. He's too strong.
Avatar, don't do it.
You may be right... but I gotta battle my brother.
You find an entrance into the castle.
Smash the projector, and tell Elinore... that Avatar will die with her tonight... even if we win.
Hello.
You have aged, old fool.
The world is mine.
- Weehawk!
- Slut!
Weehawk, don't!
Weehawk, don't! Don't! Don't!
Stop, elf!
Blood on blood flowing, fathers and sons dying... brothers and lovers spilling false hate and rivers of life flowing away.
Fool elf! Think your sword is always quick, but what else?
Think!
Weehawk, I could not help it.
When I touched Peace in the desert...
Blackwolf trapped my mind.
I'm not as strong as Peace. It hurts.
Avatar must know.
The trouble with you, my brother... is that you've always been too good.
Well, that may be.
But I still think I look more like Ma than you do.
You know, uh, lots of character.
I'm agin' better.
Brother, there is no need for me to destroy you.
Surrender.
Surrender your world.
You always did need an audience, you sap.
Let me tell ya...
I ain't practiced much magic for a long time.
I wanna show you a trick Mother showed me when you weren't around... to use on special occasions like this.
Ah. Oh, yeah, one more thing...
I'm glad you changed your last name, you son of a bitch.
Avatar!
Elinore's no traitor!
She was possessed by Blackwolf.
It is done! It is done!
The world is free!
The projector destroyed,
the battle was over.
Shadow creatures
froze in their tracks.
Some faded...
some crawled back to hell.
Mutants... leaderless... ran.
Elves swept the beaches clear of the few
remaining mutants that still fought...
- As hundreds of circling black birds...
screamed at the carnage below.
There was some rejoicing.
But mostly, everyone wished
to return home quickly...
to tell their loved ones
that the war was won...
Hitler was dead again...
and that they could live
once more in peace...
in the land they loved so much...
God-given. Amen.
God-given. Amen.
Avatar! Look what I caught!
Don't hurt Larry. Larry served.
Beast of a thousand scales...
Hey, hey, hey. Set it free.
It's harmless without Blackwolf.
Pity it. It's not its fault.
Mmm. So be it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, master.
We ride back to Montagar.
Weehawk, you ride back to Montagar alone.
Avatar and I will start a new kingdom somewhere.
You will rule Montagar as their new king.
Are you and Avatar married, my Queen?
Hey, kid, take it easy, huh?
You did a good job, but don't get carried away.
You think Avatar's too old to get married?
Weehawk, how many years do wizards live, 10,000 or more?
And I got at least a thousand left, you know what I mean?
Forgive me, Avatar.
Forgive me, both of you.
For Montagar, forever.
Well, come on. Let's make it.
Avatar,
You're getting older and much bolder.
Come on! I meant let's make it out of here.
Sure you did.
MAN: Hit the release!
Hit the release!
What happened?
MAN 2: Christ,
I couldn't find the release!
Christ, I've never seen them do that before.
Whatever they're after must be down in that gully.
If it's down there, must be a dead man.
They don't pull like that for no dead man.
Hey!
Lon, Lon, give us a hand.
(WHISPERS) He's gone.
I didn't hear him hit.
Let's go down after him.
Jim?
JIM: Hey, Bill!
MAN: John, save the left stage booms.
Thank you.
I don't know why you don't just tell him.
Because I know what he'll say.
The world's in such a mess, it's unfair to bring a child into it,
That there are three million unwanted children.
But the fact is,
Maggie, you're pregnant,
And it's your body, and it's your choice.
And if what you wanna do in this world is make a beautiful baby,
Then nobody, including a cynical husband,
Has the right to stand in your way.
He's not cynical.
Obsessed.
He's dedicated.
Dedicated, obsessed,
Call it what you like,
But if you get talked into an abortion you don't want,
You'll never forgive yourself.
Why don't you get it over with?
Go home and tell him.
I need to pick the right time.
MAN: (ON LOUDSPEAKER) must speak in a single voice.
They will listen!
We have heard that the Indian must fight to keep what is his,
And that time has come again.
We will fight to keep our forests!
Hey, can I carry your bag?
Right up there, sir.
Okay.
Hey, take this for me and show me where, will ya?
All right.
Okay, thanks.
This way, please.
Okay, it's all right.
Gonna be all right.
I showed it to the man.
He say it was chicken pox.
I say to him,
"There's rats in here."
He said,
"This is chicken pox."
I said to him,
"Ain't no chickens in here.
"There's rats in here, and them rats bit my baby."
You know what he said to me?
He said,
"The rats got to have room to live, too."
Does he live in this building, your landlord?
(SNIFFLING) No, sir.
He lives in Georgetown.
He lives with the rich rats up there.
I'm gonna have to put your baby in a hospital,
And I'm gonna be in touch with your landlord.
How about putting my landlord in the hospital?
That's what
I'd like to do.
So would I, but let's take care of your baby first, okay?
Rob?
Vic, what are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Will you ride back with me?
Yeah, take him to emergency.
You really look tired.
Oh, yeah?
The hours getting to you?
It's not the hours.
It's the damn futility.
God.
You know, I'll write a report here that no one will read.
I'll file a lawsuit against a landlord
That'll be settled out of court.
Send that baby to the hospital for a couple of days,
So he can come back here and be eaten by rats again.
Feel like I'm banging my head up against a wall.
I don't think anybody's listening.
You wanna know something?
If I could've planned your side of this conversation,
I couldn't have done it better.
Remember that hearing I asked you to come to this morning?
Sorry, sorry.
It was the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
They're listening to the complaints
Of a couple of tribes from Maine.
They're about to get squeezed the way the people in these tenements are.
Like these people are?
Are you crazy, Vic?
I saw the demonstrators this morning.
All right, all right, all right.
Listen to me, listen to me.
This paper company,
Pitney Mills Paper Company,
Bought the timber rights to 100,000 acres of forest in Maine.
The Indians claim the land is theirs,
And they blockaded access to the forest, keeping the lumberjacks out.
The Supreme Court's filed a restraining order against the blockade.
Everybody's ready to kill each other,
And the whole thing is holding for an Environmental
Protection report.
What does the Environmental
Protection Agency
Have to do with a land dispute?
Nobody wants to rule on the legalities of who owns the land.
So they're trying to break the deadlock on environmental grounds.
If we file a negative report,
Then the lumber company won't have much reason to proceed.
File a positive report, the Indians will probably have to give way.
Another political football?
If you're looking for a job that's got permanent impact,
This is the one.
I mean, you're gonna set a precedent that'll be very hard to break.
Vic, it's not my game.
I'm strictly a rat bite and gas leak man.
I can teach you what you need to know.
I can give you the books to take up with you.
I'm in public health.
I'm a doctor.
And you know how to deal with human beings.
The Indians are angry, and so is the lumber company.
If we don't get full cooperation from both of them,
We're gonna have a lot of trouble getting enough information
For a thorough report.
I got all the tree experts I need.
I need someone who can deal with people.
Come on, come on.
It's two weeks of your time.
Take Maggie along.
It'll be good for both of you to get away.
It's beautiful.
It's so peaceful.
I'd forgotten the world could look like this.
Maybe that's one of our problems.
We can't see the forest for the trees.
It's a joke.
Here, get that.
Going camping?
Well, not exactly.
We're gonna be in a cabin.
We're gonna be outside,
By a river.
Hey, great.
And it's gonna take three days to walk down there.
Sounds hard.
Yeah, but that's the fun.
What is that?
Look!
That's the damnedest thing I've ever seen!
What do you think it's doing?
Beats me.
Mr. Verne.
Bethel Isely,
Pitney Lumber Company.
How do you do?
Have a nice flight?
Indeed. My wife,
Maggie. Mr. Isely.
Welcome to the state of Maine,
Mrs. Verne.
Hello.
Kelso!
I got a car for ya, like your office wanted.
Somebody to drive it, so you can ride up to the lake with me.
Fine.
That a Ruggieri?
Montagnana.
You know cellos.
Well, I know wood.
That's got a balsam back and a spruce belly and a maple bridge.
There's three different kinds of trees in there.
Very impressive.
I can't carry a tune in a bucket, though.
Hollis!
Excuse me.
Here you go.
It's the biggest fiddle you ever saw.
Yes, sir.
What's that dog doing up in the air?
Oh, that's what's left of our search and rescue team.
Secure that well!
Beg your pardon?
I don't quite understand.
Oh, couple of men got lost up in the mountains.
Men from our company, as a matter of fact.
Lumberjacks.
They sent up a search team from Androscoggin
To go looking for them.
Couple of days later, one of the search dogs shows up
At a ranger station.
No sign of the people who brought her in there.
What do you suppose happened to them?
Well, I guess they got lost, too.
Rescue team?
Is that possible?
Look. I'll be truthful with you.
This particular forest isn't too safe right now.
Why's that?
Excuse me, Rob.
We'd like to tie your bag.
That's okay.
Well, the Indians, they're angry in there.
They're trying to keep the lumber company out any way they can.
People start disappearing, and the Indians spread the word
That they were taken by Katahdin.
That's one of their legends.
They call it Katahdin.
Yeah, it's sort of a Bigfoot, I guess, only it's uglier.
Yeah, it's larger than a dragon and got the eyes of a cat.
Yeah, they've thrown in everything but the kitchen sink.
Oh, yes, my wife put together a box of groceries for you.
Yes, thank you.
I saw that.
I guess you're gonna have everything you're gonna need.
You follow me in there, Kelso.
Right, sir.
You see, the idea of this legend
Is to frighten the lumberjacks out.
They're almost as superstitious as the Opies.
Opies?
O.P. O.P.'s.
Original people.
Yeah, that's what they call themselves now.
The Anishinaabegs,
Passamaquoddy,
Wampanoags and the Yuroks,
They all joined together.
Call themselves the Opies.
Mr. Verne.
What about those people, the ones who disappeared?
Well, I'll tell ya something.
If you ask me,
I wouldn't have sent a search team in there.
I'd have sent a posse.
Why is that?
You think the
Indians did it?
No doubt in my mind.
BETHEL: There's the general store
And post office and Laundromat, Mrs. Verne.
You can leave your money in that bank there, if you wanna.
You know, all that stuff about the paper companies ruining the forests,
That's pure myth.
We've been running a pulp operation on the upper Espee here
For 20 years now.
We plant seedlings every time we harvest.
That land is more stable today than it was when
God himself made it.
Well, to give him his due,
He didn't have modern science to help him.
He didn't have hydroponics and silviculture techniques.
I'd say he did pretty well under the circumstances.
What with his limited education.
Yeah.
What's this?
Mr. Hawks.
These people are from the Environmental
Protection Agency.
I'd appreciate being let through.
No car from the lumber company gets through here.
This is against the law, John.
The law has not brought justice.
The Supreme Court has issued a restraining order against this blockade.
And which Supreme Court is that, Mr. Isely?
The Supreme Court of the United States.
Yes, we've tried that Supreme Court.
Now we're going to one that's higher.
You a part of this, Ramona?
By birth, Mr. Isely.
Can we walk in?
It's 10 miles.
Is there another road?
No, Mrs. Verne, there isn't.
John, tell your people to get out of the way.
Kelso!
Cut down those two trees, please.
Mr. Isely...
I don't get the point.
What are you trying to prove?
Nobody's going to get hurt.
The point is not to be intimidated.
Cut them down.
Don't let this happen!
BETHEL: Are you gonna stand aside, Hawks?
I'm gonna tell you right now!
You cut my head off before you cut these trees!
Oh, come on!
Take them down!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Stop it! Stop it, please!
Make him stop it!
Open the chain, John.
I won't open it!
Open it, God damn it!
What the hell does this prove, anyway?
RAMONA:
That they're murderers.
No, it doesn't prove a damn thing!
Now open it!
No!
Open it!
Don't!
These are violent people,
Mr. Verne.
They get drunk and they get violent.
You gotta show them when you mean business.
ROB: I swear, Maggie, that must have been a world's record.
I've never heard of such a big salmon.
Well, this is the land of Paul Bunyan and his giant ox, Babe.
Was that Maine?
Sure was.
Well, there might be something to it.
That fish was a giant.
Maybe you'll go home with a trophy.
I can't get over it.
God knows what would happen if I hooked into it.
Hmm, taste this.
Aphrodisia.
You think you could catch any more?
Are you kidding?
I'm one of the world's great fishermen.
Well, you fish, and I'll eat.
Now that's a relationship.
Do you wanna know something?
I was so proud of you today.
That made the ghetto seem suddenly very peaceful to me.
You know something else?
I was jealous of that Indian woman.
She had so much courage to be so strong when she was frightened,
To demand her own way.
It's a kind of courage
I don't have much of.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I think it takes a lot of courage to put up with me.
I love you.
I love you so much,
I wish there were more of you.
Well, I could easily put on 20 pounds.
I mean, I wish there were more of us.
I'm sorry.
It's something
I want to discuss.
Now?
Why not now?
Everything's so perfect.
You know how I feel.
When I was a child, my mother told me
I had to eat everything on my plate
Because there were starving children in the world.
It didn't make any sense to me.
Now you tell me
I mustn't get pregnant
Because there are starving children
In the world, and that doesn't make any sense to me, either.
It does to me.
You're afraid, aren't you?
I don't know.
I don't know about a lot of things anymore.
I feel like
I've been going around and around
A racetrack at
100 miles an hour,
And I wound up where I started.
No one else was in the race.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
What's wrong, Dad?
Turn that thing off.
But you said
I could play it for another 10 minutes.
Just turn it off.
What is it?
Nothing.
Can I turn it on again?
Yeah.
The soil's a clay base.
I'm sending samples on tomorrow.
Yeah. Oh, listen, Vic.
I'm including a couple of tissue samples from the raccoon.
Check them out for me, will you?
No, I examined them, but...
No, it wasn't rabies.
I don't know what it is, but there's definitely something wrong.
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, you should be.
Oh, she's fine.
Talk to you Tuesday.
Mr. Verne.
My name is John Hawks.
I remember.
I'd like you to come with us, if you would.
What for?
I want to speak with you.
Right here will be fine.
Are you afraid of us?
Somewhat.
Because of what you've heard?
No, it's not what I've heard, but what I've seen.
You've heard we're drunks, we're violent,
And that we're murderers.
And that's what they're saying about us in Washington,
Because they're discounting our rights with these lies.
I can understand how you must feel,
But my work here has nothing to do...
Are you deaf
Like the rest?
I'm a fairly well-educated person,
Mr. Verne.
I was educated at your schools.
I studied your laws.
I perfected your language.
Of course, your laws have never really applied to us,
But your language, it seems to have
Been wasted in the Indian's mouth,
Because, well, you refuse to hear.
Why is it you refuse to hear?
Oh, I can hear.
But I can also see.
You seem surprised that people think you're violent.
The violence is always provoked.
By whom?
It was necessary.
It was suicidal.
Tell me, for what you believe in,
You willing to die?
Look, I'm here to study the environment.
I'm curious.
What's your concept of the environment, Mr. Verne?
Is it rocks?
Oh, come on! This...
'Cause the environment is us,
And it's being mangled.
I'm gonna make something clear to you.
My people are violently ill.
They're beginning to lose their faculties.
They stagger and they fall,
And this has nothing to do with alcohol, as these villagers claim.
My people are fishermen.
Their lives are clean.
I'm a midwife, and I've seen children born dead, born deformed.
So badly some have had to be put to death.
Three times we have been to the government,
And three times they've turned us away.
You see, the end of this forest is the end of my people.
Don't talk about the environment
As though it had nothing to do with us.
These people want us to go with them.
They have some things they want to show us.
I think we should go.
Is this your village?
No.
This is the home of Hector M'Rai.
My grandfather.
JOHN: This is the last remnant of how my people once lived.
I wanted you to see this before you
See what we've become.
My grandfather built this place, and to him it's very sacred.
These are the people from the government.
How many?
Well, there are two of us, sir.
Is that enough?
Well, we're working very hard.
That good.
Your home is very beautiful.
Thank you.
Don't mistake these tents for his home.
His home is this whole forest.
You know, just three days ago
I was visiting a place
Where there were 11 people living in a single room.
Oh, yes?
I just thought you should know.
What, that we are asking too much?
That there are people in this world
Fighting for a single inch of living space.
Yes, because they fought too late.
OLD MAN: This camp is as the old people did it.
I'm teaching these young people
So that someone here will remember.
There are underground tunnels beneath the frost line
To store perishables.
The forest provides more food than a man could possibly need.
Here, everything grows big.
Real big.
Well, I saw a salmon that took my breath away.
It is the Garden of Eden.
I've let no one come here.
You are the first to see it.
It's magical.
We were once a magical people.
It's true. When I was a child, every rock, every tree had a story.
The whole forest was filled with legends.
We heard about one of them.
RAMONA: Yes?
"Katydah" something.
Katahdin.
Katahdin is no legend.
My grandfather is the oldest person in our tribe.
It's his duty to foster these beliefs.
I have seen him.
And what does he look like?
He is part of all things created,
And he bears a mark
Of each of God's creatures.
You say that with great affection.
He has wakened to protect us.
Why are these logs in here?
They come twice each year, then they disappear.
What is that?
RAMONA: He says he will show you why he calls it the Garden of Eden.
Rob. What's wrong?
These are feeder roots.
They should be underground.
JOHN: Here.
(OLD MAN SPEAKING
IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)
It's a tadpole.
I told you things grow big here.
You've seen this before?
No.
No one has seen them.
They're only in this pond.
What does this pond feed into?
The Espee River.
That's where the paper mill is.
BETHEL: This is the flume.
All the wood that's unfit for lumberyards is cut into sections,
Fed down this channel into the grinding machine.
It's a very simple process in a very conventional industry.
We even use stone grinders to turn the logs into pulp.
Oh, let me give you a hand here, Mrs. Verne.
Once here, the pulp is bleached.
With the exception of grocery bags,
Nobody likes paper that isn't white.
What do you use to bleach it with?
Chlorine.
But it stays right here in the plant.
None of it goes out into the water?
No, sir, not a drop.
I'd like to see more.
This way.
You all right?
I'm fine.
You see now, when the pulp gets down here,
It's pressed into sheets and dried into paper.
You feel all right?
You better stand over here, Mrs. Verne.
That sheet's traveling
3,000 feet a minute.
Now, you see, the pulp is fibrous.
When it's dry, those fibers interconnect, forming a solid.
And the only chemical you use in this plant is chlorine?
Yes. Oh, no, excuse me.
There's a caustic solution that's used in the grinding process,
But it's biodegradable, approved by the EPA,
And it doesn't go into the watershed.
Well, I guess that's it,
Mrs. Verne.
Thank you.
Well, clean as a whistle, huh?
Thank you, sir.
Tell me something.
BETHEL: Yeah.
What happens to the trees before they get here?
They get floated down the river to the plant here.
That's it? You don't hold them anywhere?
Yeah, if we get stacked up.
Where do you hold them?
Oh, various places.
Ponds?
You hold them in ponds?
Probably, softens them up to soak them.
Do you soak them in chemicals?
Well, you're gettin' out of my area here.
Transport's handled by a private contractor.
I asked you a question.
Well, I'm answering your question.
You're responsible for whatever effluent goes out of this plant.
You hire the contractors.
You sell the product.
You're accountable for whatever goes on here.
Rob, stop it.
Now, just...
How many pages in this report you're gonna write?
I asked you a question.
Now let me ask you a question.
How many pages, 100?
How many copies,
1,000, maybe?
I wanna know what chemicals you're using.
We're talking about
100,000 pieces of paper just for your report.
Am I far off? Eh?
And how many sheets of paper
Are in all those filing cabinets in Washington?
You're not answering me.
I am answering you!
Now, I supply what you demand.
You're responsible, too.
Now, unless you want to start filling your filing cabinets with rocks
And wiping your nose with cactus...
I wanna know what you soak the logs in.
What chemical?
None.
I don't believe that!
Well, then you take water samples.
That's what we do.
Yes, sir.
Now, look, if those logs were soaked in chemicals,
It would squeeze out in the pulping process
Right into the watershed in front of this plant.
Now, we test that water every 10 days,
And there's not a damn thing floating out there
That we don't know about,
Or anything that's harmful to the environment.
Now, excuse me,
Mrs. Verne.
That's okay.
Go on! Go test the water!
We got nothing to hide!
Let it down.
Take it in there.
I told you to watch the tide.
Yeah.
You okay?
Hold the boat.
Let's get them in there.
Get them out of here.
Sorry about that.
I didn't realize.
We tried to tell ya.
I know you did.
It's my fault.
Okay, let's go, boys.
Move it out.
I believe him.
Why?
Why would he have offered to let you test the water?
Maybe it wasn't in the water.
Huh?
Maybe it's heavier than water.
That silvery stuff on your boot.
Is it dry?
Yes.
They gave us a trick question in medical school.
"What's the only liquid in the world that isn't wet?"
What was the answer?
Mercury.
ROB: "Inorganic methylmercury, known as PMT."
"Used as a de-sliming agent that collects algae"
"And prevents it from forming on pre-processed timber."
"Its widespread use discontinued in 1956"
"When evidence of its fatal effects"
"Were seen in the deaths of 100,000 people in Minamata, Japan."
Rob, what is it?
It's methylmercury poisoning, that's what it is.
This whole place has been contaminated.
How do you know?
The Indians eat the fish,
And they behave like they're drunk
When they haven't had a drop of liquor.
That raccoon convulsing and turning vicious,
Its brain turned to mush.
Even that old man, that Indian.
You saw the burns on his fingers.
Is that from mercury?
It's from cigarettes.
The reason he didn't feel it is from mercury.
You see, it acts on the nervous system.
It destroys the brain.
Why are they using it?
Why?
Listen to this.
ROB: (ON TAPE) described as the most potent neurotoxin
Of the post-World War II age.
Listen.
Used from 1948 to 1956
In pulping processes as a cheap and effective caustic agent...
That's why they use it, because it's cheap!
ROB: (ON TAPE) from forming on waterlogged timber.
It is also known for its mutagenic properties,
Concentrating in the bodies of fish and plankton-eating crustacea,
Affecting the fetal development of everything that ingests it.
For 20 years, it's been pouring into this water.
The ratio of toxin to blood level...
It's in the fish, is that it?
And everything that eats the fish.
It was discovered after extensive testing
That it is the only mutagen that jumps the placental barrier,
Concentrating in fetal blood cells, where it adheres to the DNA
And corrupts the chromosomes.
ROB: (ON TAPE) The ratio of toxin to blood level
Is 30% higher in the developing fetus than in the host.
It was discovered after extensive testing
That it is the only mutagen that jumps the placental barrier,
Concentrating in fetal blood cells,
Where it adheres to the DNA and corrupts the chromosomes.
"Jumps the placental barrier."
What does that mean?
It's a mutagen.
A mutagen.
What is that?
Freakism!
Freakism.
That's what's been going on out there.
That's why there's a goddamn salmon five feet long
And a tadpole the size of what a bullfrog should be.
And stillbirths.
What?
That's what that
Indian woman said, and deformed children.
God knows what else has been going on out there.
So, if a pregnant animal ate some fish, it could...
Yes.
My God.
Is it possible?
Yes.
The size of a dragon.
What?
The size of a dragon, isn't that what Isely said at the airport?
And something about eyes, cat's eyes.
And the old man, the Indian,
Didn't he describe that creature as being
A part of everything in God's creation?
Isn't that what he said?
Yes.
Let me try and put this together.
A developing fetus goes through certain distinct...
A developing fetus goes through certain distinct phases.
Each phase represents a specific stage of evolution.
A human fetus, for instance,
At one stage, it's a fish.
It looks like a fish.
It's got fins and gills.
At another, it's amphibian, webbed hands,
At another, reptilian, at another, it's feline,
Developing upward in the distinct shapes and phases
Of the evolutionary scale.
If this chemical,
Methylmercury, adheres to the DNA...
DNA's a chromosomal fixative.
Well, it could freeze certain parts at one evolutionary stage,
While the other parts continue growing.
You follow?
Yes.
Uh, a pregnant animal ingests the fish, and it corrupts the fetus
To the point where it gives birth to a monster.
Corrupts the fetus to the point where it gives birth to a monster.
How much fish would it take for...
It concentrates in the fetal blood cells.
How much?
Very little.
I'll need proof.
You're not sure?
Well, I've got to get blood samples.
Our first priority is these people.
How long before you'll know?
A week, 10 days.
Thank you.
Mike?
Mike Greenbriar.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
What's going on here?
There were more killings in the forest last night,
And we're not waiting for any more.
Who was killed?
A family up at
Mary's Bend.
What makes you think these people had anything to do with it?
They're guilty as hell, Verne.
I want the following people to step forward
As their names are read.
John Hawks.
ROB: Where's the evidence?
The evidence is at the hospital.
It's in baskets.
Mr. Hawks, are you gonna step forward?
Well, Hawks, you gonna step forward as instructed?
Stop! Stop that man.
Let him go, Charlie.
We'll get him later.
Get these other Opies.
BETHEL: I'm sorry, Mr. Verne.
Sorry, Mrs. Verne.
We just gotta do it.
Mary's Bend.
You know where it is?
Yeah.
I want to go there.
Just follow us right to the car.
Okay?
POLICEMAN: Steven Sky.
Where's the bend?
Around that ridge.
There's an inlet.
Can we go down?
PILOT: Just for a minute.
I don't like the look of that sky.
This is helicopter
Ray-Zebra-2-3-Yankee to base.
Breaking radio contact.
Do you copy?
MAN: I read you five-by-five.
Stay in here out of the rain.
Now look, we got about five or 10 minutes at the most!
Okay.
This way.
What's the matter, airsick?
A little.
Got just the thing.
Ammonia.
No.
You'd better take just a whiff.
The way this weather looks, it's gonna be a rough and bumpy ride going home.
Okay?
Ramona.
What could have done this?
A bear, perhaps.
That deep?
That from a bear?
No.
What is it, then?
You know this forest.
What could it be?
John!
Boy, I'm in here tight.
If this wind kicks up any higher,
I can't clear those trees.
Sure hope you and your friends don't mind walking out of here.
You remember we talked about those poachers?
See those nets over there?
They string them across the river
And catch everything that comes down.
MAGGIE: Rob!
Maggie!
What is it?
There are two of them, and one's alive.
We gotta get this one warm.
Leave it here.
Let it die.
Let it die?
Do you know what this is?
This is evidence.
This may be the evidence
That'll save your people and this forest.
John, get the other one.
ROB: Let's get out of here!
PILOT: No way!
What do you mean?
You see those trees?
That's 40 miles an hour!
I gotta get someplace warm!
So what do we do?
Take shelter!
How long?
Two hours, maybe less.
We don't have the time!
I've gotta get this thing back or it'll die!
What is that?
Never mind. Come on.
I warned you when we came down.
I can't do it!
Christ. How far is your village?
Too far.
Ten miles.
Is there something else, someplace else?
My grandfather.
Tents?
It's only half a mile.
Look, I need someplace where it's warm,
Where I can work on this thing to keep it alive.
We can build fires inside.
We can make it warm.
Let's go there.
There's no other choice.
Okay, let's go.
RAMONA: John! John!
It's all right!
They're not here!
M'Rai?
Which one?
Go in that one.
Go in that one.
(RAMONA SPEAKING
IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)
Get this inside!
We're gonna need some light in here.
Can we get some light?
The old man is gone.
They don't know where.
ROB: I said, could you get me some more light in here?
RAMONA: Here, here's a lantern.
ROB: Now, you said you could get this place warm.
RAMONA: I'll bring in some embers.
Can these people help us?
They can send someone from the village.
Send them. Tell them to get people here.
I want people to see this.
Is there a newspaper in town?
Yes.
Get them here with a camera.
And people from that paper mill, and that sheriff.
Not that sheriff.
I can't do that.
Hawks!
He'll see the truth here,
And you have more at stake in this truth than I have.
Please hurry.
Can you get that lantern above the table?
MAGGIE: Will it die?
I don't know.
I hope to keep its heart beating with a little adrenalin.
Do you want some rags?
Yeah, not too hot.
Not steaming.
Nothing down there but dirt.
Any supplies?
Not any that
I could see.
What I could really use is a sterile jar.
MAN: I've got a jar of vitamins in my pack.
Look.
MAGGIE: Can't you stop it?
I don't dare sedate it.
Here's the rag.
That'll help.
Here's your jar.
Okay.
Maggie?
Maggie.
Yes?
In my bag there's some surgical tubing.
Come on.
I know it's a nightmare, okay?
But it'll be over soon.
We'll get out of here in the morning
And go home tomorrow.
You know what that old man said about
This creature awakening to protect them?
In a strange way, that's true.
This is gonna stop what's going on.
People can't ignore it anymore.
There's a reason.
There's a reason it's happened.
There's a reason why we're here.
I'm pregnant.
What?
I'm pregnant.
And I ate what the mother of those creatures ate.
It's not a nightmare that's gonna end.
It's just beginning because it's inside me.
I'm pregnant.
It's the ugliest sound I've ever heard.
Why didn't I know?
You didn't wanna know!
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen!
You were too busy playing God to be a human being!
I thought having a baby
Would bring us closer together.
It's not a baby anymore.
Maggie...
No! Ah.
We can take care of it.
No!
I can't kill it!
I wanted a baby.
I know.
I know.
We'll get through it.
We'll get through it.
MAGGIE: It wants to be born.
Mr. Verne!
I feel it.
I'll stay in the tunnels until they're gone.
Mr. Verne, what's the meaning of this?
It's the answer,
Mr. Isely,
To some very
Important questions.
This is a result of methylmercury
Spilling out of your plant.
My God.
Did you know?
Did you know?
I didn't want to.
M'Rai!
Welcome.
Get into these tunnels!
The tunnels!
Get into these tunnels!
ROB: Hawks, the pilot's barely alive.
We gotta get him to town.
The town is too far.
It's 12 miles.
Our village is closer.
ROB: He's in a coma.
Can we carry him that far?
JOHN: I can make a stretcher to carry that pilot.
ROB: Will there be a car in the village?
No, but there's shelter there,
And we can send for help.
BETHEL: It'll take too long.
If we send someone from the village,
By the time they get back, we'll be looking at nightfall again.
ROB: And what's our alternative?
Who knows when that damn thing will come back?
JOHN:
What about the helicopter?
There's a radio in there.
No, it doesn't work unless it's up in the air.
BETHEL: There's a microwave tower.
It's on the top of Mount Emery,
Controls all the communication in this area.
ROB: How far is that?
Six, seven miles, maybe.
Can't walk six miles through the forest
Not knowing where that damn thing is.
I can.
You go to the village.
I'll go there.
If I can make contact,
You'll be out of here by nightfall.
Now, let me do this, now.
Ah!
ROB: Where did they go?
RAMONA: They've taken everything.
ROB: Where can we put him?
JOHN: Let's take him inside.
ROB: I think we'd better try for town.
RAMONA: He's delirious.
ROB: I don't wanna spend the night here.
Listen, three-quarters of a mile from here,
Where they cut the trees, they left a carrier.
Carrier?
It's like a tank.
It's used for moving equipment.
It'll go through anything.
Will it run?
There are tools in the cabin.
I'm gonna cross the wires.
How long will it take to get to town?
If we leave now, three hours, maybe four.
It'll be night by then.
It'll be night here, too.
But we have shelter here.
This isn't shelter enough.
Let's go.
Come up here.
The cabin!
Maggie!
Katahdin.
Katahdin!
No!
It's coming.
It's drowned.
It's drowned.
It's drowned! It's drowned!
It's drowned.
It's drowned.
It's...
It's drowned.
It's drowned.
ROB: Let's barricade this place! Maggie, light!
Christ!

(thunder crashes)
(thunder crashes)
(clock strikes)
If we look at the base of a brain which has just been removed from a skull… there's very little of the mid-brain that we can actually see.
Yet, as I demonstrated in my lecture last week… if the under aspects of the temporal lobes are gently pulled apart… the upper portion of the stem of the brain can be seen.
This so-called brain stem consists of the mid-brain… a rounded protrusion called the pons… and a stalk tapering downwards called the medulla oblongata… which passes out of the skull through the foramen magnum… and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.
Are there any questions before we proceed?
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.
That's Fronkonsteen.
I beg your pardon?
My name. It's pronounced
“Fronkonsteen”.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein… who dug up freshly buried corpses and transformed dead components into…
Yes, yes!
Yes!
We all know what he did!
But I'd rather be remembered for my own small contributions to science… and not because of my accidental relationship… to a famous… cuckoo!
(laughter)
Now, if you don't mind, can we have your question?
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction… between reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.
Good. Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction… why don't we proceed?
Mr Hilltop here, with whom I have never worked… or given any prior instructions to… has graciously offered his services for today's demonstration.
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet and stand beside this table?
Nice… hopping.
Mr Hilltop… would you raise… your left knee, please?
You have just witnessed a voluntary nerve impulse.
It begins as a stimulus from the cerebral cortex… passes through the brain stem and to the muscles involved.
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.
Reflex movements are those which are made independently of the will… but are carried out along pathways… which pass between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system.
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch!
(students gasp)
We are not aware of these impulses.
Neither do we intend them to carry out our contraction of muscles.
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.
But what if we block the nerve impulse by simply applying local pressure… which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp… just at the swelling on the posterior nerve roots… for, oh, say… five or six seconds?
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard!
As you can see, all communication is shut off.
–(Hilltop moans)
–(students laugh)
In spite of our mechanical magnificence… if it were not for this continuous stream of motor impulses… we would collapse… like a bunch of broccoli!
Ohhh!
(applause)
In conclusion, it should be noted…
–Give him an extra dollar.
–Extra dollar. Yes, sir. that any more than common injury…
–(moans)
–… to the nerve root is always serious.
Because once a nerve fibre is severed… there is no way, in heaven or on earth… to regenerate life back into it.
Are there any last questions before we leave?
Uh, Dr Frank…
–Fronkonsteen…
–Yes?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case… until, by some extraordinary means… it actually began to move with a voluntary motion?
Are you speaking of the worm or the spaghetti?
Why, the worm, sir.
Yes! It seems to me I did read something of that incident when I was a student.
But you have to remember that a worm, with very few exceptions… is not a human being.
(laughter)
But wasn't that the basis of your grandfather's work, sir?
The reanimation of dead tissue?
My grandfather was a very sick man.
But as a Fronkonsteen, aren't you the least bit curious about it?
Doesn't bringing back to life what was once dead hold any intrigue for you?
You are talking about the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind.
Dead is dead!
But look at what has been done with hearts and kidneys.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys!
I'm talking about the central nervous system!
But, sir…
I am a scientist, not a philosopher!
You have more chance of reanimating this scalpel… than of mending a broken nervous system!
–But what about your grandfather's work?
–My grandfather's work was doo-doo!
I am not interested in death!
The only thing that concerns me is the preservation of life!
Class… is… dismissed.
(applause)
Dr Frankenstein…
That's… Fronkonsteen.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
I have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you the will of your great-grandfather.
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.
Oh, my sweet darling.
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, darling, so will I.
–Not on the lips.
–What?
I'm going to that party at Nanna and Nicky's later. I don't wanna smear my lipstick.
–You understand.
–Of course.
All aboard!
–Oh, dear!
–Well… I guess this is it.
Freddy, darling!
Oh, how can I say in a few minutes what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?
–Won't you try?
–All right.
You've got it, mister.
I'm yours. All of me. What else can I say?
My sweet love…
The hair! The hair! Just been set.
Sorry… Sorry.
I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.
I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights!
Oh! You're incorrigible!
Does that mean… you love me?
–You bet your boots it does.
Oh, my only love.
(gasps) Taffeta, darling.
Taffeta, sweetheart.
No, the dress is taffeta.
–It wrinkles so easily.
–Oh.
All aboard!
Oh, there's that horrid man again.
Well, hurry now, before I make a fool of myself.
Oh! Nails! Oh…
Sorry…
–Goodbye, darling.
–Goodbye, Freddy.
Darling!
(she coughs and splutters)
–Harry, he was at it again.
–So what do you want me to do about it?
Every day!
Let him! Let him!
New York next! Everybody out for New York!
–Heinz, er macht das schon wieder.
–Na, was soll ich denn da machen?
Aber jeden Tag!
Nu, lass ihn, lass ihn.
Transylvania nächste!
Jeder aussteigen für Transylvania!
Transylvania nächste!
Jeder aussteigen für Transylvania!
Pardon me, boy!
Is this the Transylvania Station?
Ja, ja! Track 29!
Oh! Can I give you a shine?
Uh… No, thanks.
(train puffing)
(footsteps and scraping)
Dr Frankenstein?
Fronkonsteen.
You're putting me on.
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.
Do you also say Frodorick?
No. Frederick.
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.
I see.
You must be Igor.
No. It's pronounced I-gor.
–But they told me it was Igor.
–Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Uh… You were sent by
Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes. My grandfather used to work for your grandfather.
(giggles) How nice.
Of course, the rates have gone up.
Of course. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly.
–(hollow sound)
–Oh!
Sorry. I… Uh…
You know, I don't mean to embarrass you, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.
Perhaps I could help you with that hump.
What hump?
Let's go.
Allow me, master.
Oh… Thanks very much.
Walk this way.
This way.
(thunder crashes)
I think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.
Oh…
–(woman) Ooh!
–What was that?
Oh, that'll be Inga.
Herr Falkstein thought you might need a laboratory assistant temporarily.
Oh.
Ooh!
Hello!
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?
It's fun!
♫ Roll, roll
♫ Roll in the hay
–Hah!
–(Freddy) Oh…
(thunder)
Oh!
Sometimes I am afraid of the lightning.
It's just an atmospheric discharge.
Nothing to be afraid of.
(howling)
Werewolf!
Werewolf⁈
–There!
–What?
There wolf!
There castle!
Why are you talking that way?
–I thought you wanted to.
–No, I don't want to!
Suit yourself. I'm easy.
Well…
There it is.
Home.
What knockers!
Oh… Thank you, Doctor.
Oh. That's all right.
There we are.
(door creaks)
I am Frau Blücher.
(horses neigh)
Steady!
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.
This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present Frau Blücher?
(neighing)
I wonder what's got into them.
Your rooms have been prepared,
Herr Doktor.
If you will follow me.
L-gor! Would you bring the bags as soon as you're finished, please?
Yes, master.
After you, Frau Blücher.
(neighing)
–Blücher!
–(neighing)
Follow me, please.
Stay close to the candles.
The staircase… can be treacherous.
Und this is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.
I see.
Well! Seem to be quite a few books.
This was Victor's… the Baron's medical library.
–Where is my grandfather's private library?
–I don't know what you mean, sir.
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.
–Fronkonsteen.
–Fronkonsteen.
Well, we'll see.
Good night.
Would the doctor care for a brandy before retiring?
No… Thank you.
Some warm milk… perhaps?
No… thank you very much.
No, thanks.
Ovaltine?
Nothing!
Thank you.
I'm a little tired.
Then I will say… good night.
Good night!
Good night, darling. (kisses)
Good night, Herr Doktor.
Good night, Frau Blücher.
(neighing)
(groans)
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not a Frankenstein.
I am not a Frankenstein!
I'm a Fronkonsteen!
Don't gimme that!
I don't believe in fate!
And I won't say it.
All right, you win! You win! I give.
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.
Destiny! Destiny!
No escaping that for me!
Destiny! Destiny!
No escaping that for me!
Destiny! Destiny…
No escaping… (gasps)
Dr Fronkonsteen! Wake up!
What is it?
You were having a nightmare.
(faint violin music)
–What's that strange music?
–I have no idea.
But it seems to be coming… from behind the bookcase.
Behind the bookcase…
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.
Where is it?
–Where is it?
–What?
There's always a device.
If I can just spot the triggering mechanism…
Hello!
It seems louder over here.
Hand me that candle, will you?
Put… the candle… back!
All right! I think I have it figured out now.
Take out the candle… and I'll block the bookcase with my body.
(crunch)
(high-pitched voice)
Listen to me very carefully.
Don't put the candle back!
With all of your might… shove against the other side of the bookcase.
Is that… perfectly clear?
I think so.
Good girl!
Put… the candle… back!
Oh, look, Doctor! A passageway!
Whatever that music is, it's coming from down there.
–I'd better take a look.
–Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.
I don't wanna stay up here alone.
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.
Oh, Doctor! The candle…
Good thinking. Let's try this one.
Stand back!
(♫ violin continues)
(thunder crashes)
(Inga gasps)
(squeaks)
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.
A filthy, slimy rat!
(door creaks)
Good Lord!
Oh!
–♫ I…
–Ohh!
♫ Ain't got nobody
♫ And nobody cares for me
♫ Yak-a-tata, yak-a-tata-ta-ta, hah!
–L-gor!
–Frodorick.
How did you get here?
Through the dumbwaiter.
I heard the strangest music from the upstairs kitchen and I just… followed it down.
Call it… a hunch.
Brrrm-chee!
There must have been someone else down here.
It would seem that way.
And there's the only other door.
Wait, master.
It might be dangerous.
You go first.
Aren't there any lights in this place?
Two nasty-looking switches over here, but I'm not going to be the first.
Well…
Damn your eyes!
Too late!
(Inga) Ohh…
So this is where it all happened.
(man) Just think! A dead brain ready to live again in a new body!
Look! No blood, no decomposition.
Just a few sutures.
–Throw the main switch.
–Yes, master.
(crackling)
What a filthy mess!
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers, couple of throw pillows…
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist has disa… p…
–Disa… what?
–…peared.
Ssh!
(whispers) There is a light coming from behind that door.
(whispers) Follow me!
(gasps) Doctor! Look!
Well… This explains the music.
–It's still warm.
–Mm.
But who was playing it?
I don't know… but whoever it was just barely finished putting out his cigar.
Such strange goings-on!
What is this place?
Music room?
But there's nothing here but books and papers!
Books and papers?
It is!
This is my grandfather's private library! I feel it!
Look! Look at this!
(heavy breathing)
(Freddy) “Until, from the midst of this darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me.”
“A light so brilliant and wondrous, and yet so simple.”
“Change the poles from plus to minus… and from minus to plus.”
Ah… ah…
“I alone succeeded in discovering the secret of bestowing life.”
“Nay, even more…
”I myself… became capable of bestowing animation… upon lifeless matter!”
It… could… work!
(thunder crashes)
–Kipper?
–Mm. Thank you, Doctor.
“As the minuteness of the parts formed a hindrance to my speed…
I resolved therefore to make the creature of a gigantic stature.”
Of course!
That would simplify everything.
In other words… his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs would all have to be increased in size.
Exactly.
He would have an enormous
Schwanzstück!
That goes without saying.
Woof!
He's gonna be very popular.
So then…
What we're aiming for is a being approximately seven feet in height… with all features either congenitally or artificially proportionate in size.
Something like… this?
Hello…
You've caught something there.
Crude, yes, primitive, yes, perhaps even grotesque… yet something inexplicable tells me… that this might be our man!
All right, all right.
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.
Get down, you fool!
Now!
What a filthy job!
–Could be worse.
–How?
Could be raining.
(footsteps)
Quick!
Need a hand?
Uh… No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.
Just a moment, sir!
I know everyone around here, but I've never seen your face before.
Can you account for yourself?
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen, newly arrived from America.
Oh, yes, sir! I was told you were here.
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.
(Freddy stamps foot)
How very nice to meet you, Constable.
–Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.
–Ooh!
–A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.
–Yes, yes.
A little nip from the old bottle wouldn't be too bad either, sir.
That's the ticket, yes!
Well, if you have everything in hand, sir, I'll say good night.
Thank you very much, Constable.
–At your service, sir, always.
–(stamps foot)
–Good night, Constable.
–Good night, sir.
Oh, what an awesome sight!
What a profound and reverend night is this.
With such a specimen for a body… all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.
–You know what to do?
–I have a pretty good idea.
Good man.
Didn't you… Didn't you use to have that on the other side?
–What?
–Your, uh…
Oh, never mind.
–Do you have that name I gave you?
–I have it written down.
–H Delbruck.
–Hans Delbruck.
(thunder rumbles)
Ohh!
–(Inga) He is hideous.
–(Freddy) He's beautiful.
And he is mine!
(thunder crashes)
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.
–Are you ready?
–Are you sure this is how they did it?
Yes, yes! It's all written down in the notes!
Now tie off the kites and hurry down as fast as you can.
What's the hurry?
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?
I say “There's a possibility of electrocution!”
Do you understand?
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?
Did you…
–Did you tie off the kites?
–Of course.
Oh… All right. Good.
(hollow sound)
–Uh… Check the generator.
–Yes, master.
L-gor!
–Release the safety valve on the main wheel.
–Yes, master.
(thunder crashes)
Can you imagine the brain of
Hans Delbruck in this body?
Oh, Frederick!
This is the moment.
Well, dear…
Are you ready?
Yes, Doctor.
Elevate me.
Now? Right here?
Yes, yes. Raise the platform.
Oh! The platform!
Oh, that! Ja… yes.
From that fateful day when stinking bits of slime… first crawled from the sea and shouted to the cold stars…
“I am man!”… our greatest dread has always been the knowledge of our own mortality.
But tonight… we shall hurl the gauntlet of science… into the frightful face of death itself.
Tonight… we shall ascend into the heavens!
We shall mock the earthquake!
We shall command the thunders… and penetrate… into the very womb of impervious nature herself!
(thunder crashing)
(wind howling)
When I give the word, throw the first switch!
You've got it, master.
Get ready!
Get set!
Go!
(electricity crackles)
Throw the second switch!
Throw the third switch!
Not… the third switch?
Throw it, I say! Throw it!
Life!
Life, do you hear me?
Give my creation… life!
Turn everything off and bring me down!
Nothing!
–Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry…
–No, no.
Be of good cheer.
If science teaches us anything… it teaches us to accept our failures… as well as our successes… with quiet… dignity… and grace.
Son of a bitch, bastard!
I'll get you for this!
What did you do to me?
–What did you do to me?
–Doctor! Doctor! Stop it!
You'll kill him!
Agh!
I don't wanna live!
I do not want to live!
(sobbing)
Quiet dignity and grace.
Ohhh! Mama!
Oh, tosh! This man is different,
I tell you!
You can see that after you've talked to him for five minutes.
Yes?
He's a Frankenstein!
–And they're all alike!
–(shouting in agreement)
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.
All those scientists, they're all alike.
They say they're working for us.
What they really want is to rule the world!
(gavel)
That's enough now! I will not have this meeting become a free-for-all!
These are very serious charges you're making… and all the more painful to us, your elders, because we still have nightmares… from five times before.
Now… we haven't heard from the one man most qualified to judge the situation fairly.
Inspector Kemp!
Will you talk to us, please?
(clicking)
(hissing)
A riot… is an ugly thing…
…und once you get one started… there is little chance of stopping it… short of bloodshed.
I think… before we go around killing people… we had better make damn sure of our evidence.
Und… we had better confirm the fact… that young Frankenstein is indeed… vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps!
(all) What?
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps!
Vootstaps!
Oh! Footsteps!
I think… what is in order… is for me to pay a little visit on the good doctor…
…und to have a nice… quiet… chat.
(Freddy) Reputation!
Reputation!
(Inga) Oh, Doctor!
You mustn't do this to yourself.
You've got to stop thinking about it.
Why, look!
You haven't even touched your food.
There!
Now I've touched it. Happy?
You know… I'll never forget my old dad.
When these things would happen to him… the things he'd say to me.
What did he say?
What the hell are you doin' in the bathroom day and night?
Why don't you get outta there and give someone else a chance?
Oh, maybe it's better this way.
The poor lifeless hulk.
Maybe it is better off dead.
(monster) Mmmm!
What is this?
Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.
Mmmmm!
Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts myself, but this is excellent.
Who are you talking to?
To you! You just made a yummy sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.
–But you did. I just heard it.
–It wasn't me.
It wasn't me!
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you…
Mmmm!
(monster moans)
(Freddy gasps)
Alive! It's alive!
It's alive!
Stand back.
Hello, there.
I'm going to set you free.
Mmmm…
–Is the sedative ready?
–(Inga) Yes, Doctor.
Mmmm.
I want you… to sit… up.
Mmmm.
Stand… on your feet.
(high-pitched) Mmm!
You can do it.
Mmmm.
Now… walk!
Doctor, I'm frightened!
Don't worry.
Good.
Good!
(monster screams)
What is it? What's the matter?
–Quick! Give him the…
–(monster yells)
Quick! Give him the…
–What? Give him the what?
–(gasps)
Three syllables.
First syllable— sounds like…
Head! Uh, sounds like head!
Bed! Uh… Said…
(both) Said!
–Said!
–Said!
Second syllable— little word.
Uh… this, that, the…
A…
–Said a…
–Said a…
Dirty word! He said a dirty word!
Oh, sounds like…
Uh, to give! Give!
Said… Said a give…
Give him a said a give!
Oh! Tive… tive… Sedative!
On the nosey!
(monster groans)
(Freddy pants)
Said a give⁈
Oh, Frederick! Are you all right?
Yes!
–Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
–Of course, Doctor.
L-gor… (clears throat)
–May I speak to you for a moment?
–Of course.
–Sit down, won't you?
–Thank you.
No, no. Up here.
Thank you.
Now… that brain that you gave me…
Was it… Hans Delbruck's?
–No.
–Ah! Good.
Uh… Would you mind telling me… whose brain… I did put in?
–Then you won't be angry?
–I will not… be… angry.
Abby someone.
Abby someone…
–Abby who?
–Abby… Normal.
Abby Normal…
I'm almost sure that was the name.
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain… into a seven-and-a-half-foot long…
54-inch wide… gorilla⁈
Is that what you're telling me⁈
Quick, quick! Give him the…
What?
–Three syllables, yes!
–(loud knocking)
I wonder who that could be at this hour.
Inga, quick! See who that is.
You… put that thing back on the operating table.
And strap him down tightly!
–Where are you going?
–To wash up. I've got to look normal.
We've all of us got to behave normally!
Hah! Monsters!
Excellent shot.
This is the 20th century, Kemp. Monsters are passé like ghosts and goblins.
Not to the good people of this village, Herr Doktor.
To them… he is a very real thing.
Especially when… there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.
(imitates sound of darts)
Nice grouping.
Thank you.
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you would fall for all this superstitious rot!
It is not superstition that worries me,
Herr Doktor, but genes und… chromosomes!
–Rubbish!
–Hm, well, you might say, but this is…
Transylvania!
Und you are a…
Frankenstein!
You, uh… seem unusually upset by this discussion.
Not in the least.
(cat yowls)
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.
(glass smashing)
Well… this was fun!
Now, if you don't mind, Inspector,
I'm a little tired.
Then…
I may give the villagers your complete assurance… that you have no interest whatsoever in carrying on your grandfather's work?
(monster) Mmmmm!
May I take that for a yes?
Mmmmm!
Very well.
–You can find the way out by yourself?
–Of course.
Until we meet again… Herr Baron.
Yes. Drop by any time.
We are always open.
(clicks heels)
Dieser verdammte Arm!
(door creaks)
(door creaks)
(gasps)
Oh, Victor!
Victor…
We have done it!
I'm going to set you free.
Would you like that,
meine Seuchekopf?
Mmm!
(sobbing)
They wanted to hurt you!
But I'm going to help you!
Thank heavens that's over with.
–Frau Blücher!
–(neighing)
Stop! Don't come closer!
–(Freddy) What are you doing?
–I'm going to set him free!
No! No, you mustn't!
Yes!
Are you insane? He'll kill you!
No, he won't. Not this one.
He is as gentle as a lamb.
(monster roars)
Stand back! Stand back! For the love of God, he has a rotten brain!
It's not rotten. It's a good brain!
It's rotten, I tell you! Rotten!
(roars)
Ixnay on the ottenray.
(Inga gasps)
I'm not afraid! I know what he likes!
(roars)
(♫ violin tune)
(Freddy) That music!
(Frau Blücher) Yes! It's in your blood!
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins!
It reaches the soul when words are useless.
Your grandfather used to play it to the creature he was making.
–Then it was you all the time!
–Yes!
–You played that music in the night.
–Yes!
–To get us into the laboratory.
–Yes!
–That was your cigar in the ashtray!
–Yes!
And it was you who left my grandfather's book out for me to find!
Yes!
–So that I would…
–Yes!
–Then you and Victor were…
–Yes!
Yes! Say it!
He was my boyfriend!
(monster screams)
You will never catch him now!
He's free! Do you hear?
Free!
(roaring)
Gone!
Gone!
We've got to find him, do you understand?
We've got to find him before he kills someone!
What have I done?
Oh, God in heaven!
What have I done?
♫ Oh, I love my pretty little flower
♫ Oh, I love my pretty little flower
♫ Oh, I love my flower
Mmmm…
That monster is loose…
Boards must be tight!
There.
Thank God you put Helga to bed.
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.
But, Papa! I told you that I was turning the Rostbraten, don't you remember?
I asked you to put Helga to…
You…
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.
Mm-mm.
Oh, dear. Nothing left.
What shall we throw in now?
Maybe she was in the bathroom when you looked!
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did!
You didn't look upstairs?
Sit down.
Sit down!
(both) Ahhh!
(♫ Schubert “Ave Maria”)
A visitor is all I ask.
A temporary companion to help me pass a few short hours in my lonely life.
(roars)
Thank you, Lord. Thank you!
Mmmm!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.
Oh, my joy… and my prize from heaven.
Oh, you must have been the tallest one in your class!
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.
–What is your name?
–Mmmm!
–I didn't get that.
–Mmmm!
Mmm! No…
Oh, forgive me.
I didn't realise you were a mute.
You see how heaven plans.
Me, a poor blind man, and you, you… a mute.
An incredibly big mute.
Ahh! But your hand is frozen, my child.
–How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?
–Mmmm!
Well… I know what it means to… to be cold and hungry.
Yes…
And how much it means to have a little kindness from a stranger.
–Are you ready for your soup?
–Mmmmm!
Hold out your bowl, then.
Oh, my friend, my friend…
You don't know what your visit means to me.
How long I've waited for the pleasure of another human being.
Sometimes in our preoccupation with worldly matters…
(whimpers) we tend to forget the simple pleasures…
–(screams)
–… that are the basis for true happiness.
Yes, yes, yes. Oh…
And now a little wine with your soup?
–Mmm.
–Good, good.
Huh? Good… Yes…
Wait!
A toast!
A toast to…
Yes! Long friendship!
–How hungry you must have been.
–Mmm.
Now… now, now for a little surprise.
For a special occasion, I've been saving… cigars!
–Mmm…
–Take one.
(angrily) Mmmm!
What?
No… no, no.
Fire is good.
Fire is good, yes.
Fire is our friend.
Yes. I-I'll show you.
I'll show you.
Mm, mm.
Mm, mm, mm.
You see? You see?
You have your cigar?
Let me see. Let me see.
All right.
Now, now, now…
Just hold it right there. Now… don't inhale until the tip glows.
Mmmowww!
(yelling)
Wait!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I was gonna make espresso.
(monster roars)
(♫ violin tune)
Now!
(roaring)
Quick! Give him the sedative!
He's out!
I know.
I'm going in there.
Bring me that candle.
–(Igor and Inga) No!
–Yes!
Love… is the only thing that can save this poor creature.
And I am going to convince him that he is loved… even at the cost of my own life.
No matter what you hear in there, no matter how cruelly I beg you… no matter how terribly I may scream… do not open this door, or you will undo everything I've worked for.
Do you understand?
Do not open this door!
Yes, Doctor.
Nice working with you.
(monster groans)
(roars)
Let me out. Let me out of here!
Get me the hell out of here!
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking!
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Jesus Christ! Get me outta here!
Open this goddamn door or I'll kick your rotten heads in!
Mommy!
Nein!
(yells)
(muttering) Obviously…
Hello, handsome!
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?
People laugh at you.
People hate you, but why do they hate you?
Because they are jealous!
(growls)
Look at that boyish face.
Look at that sweet smile.
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?
Do you want to talk about the Olympian ideal?
You are a God!
And listen to me…
You are not evil.
You… are… good!
(sobs)
Oh…
This is a nice boy.
This is a good boy.
This is a mother's angel.
And I want the world to know… once and for all and without any shame… that we love him!
(sobs)
Oh…
I'm going to teach you.
I'm gonna show you how to walk, how to speak, how to move, how to think!
Together… you and I… are going… to make the greatest single contribution to science… since the creation of fire!
Dr Fronkonsteen! Are you all right?
My name… is Frankenstein!
Distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight it is my great privilege… of introducing to you a man whose family name was once both… famous… and… infamous!
And now may I present to you
Doktor Baron Friedrich von Frankenstein!
(MC claps)
–My fellow scienti…
–(hissing) tists… and neurosurgeons, ladies and gentlemen.
A few short weeks ago, coming from a background… believe me, as conservative and traditionally grounded in scientific fact as any of you…
I began an experiment in, incredulous as it may sound… the reanimation of dead tissue.
(laughter)
What I have to offer you might possibly be… the gateway to immortality.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for your intellectual and philosophical pleasure… the Creature!
(screaming)
Remain in your seats, I beg you.
We are not children here.
We are scientists.
I assure you there is nothing to fear.
First… may I offer for your consideration… a neurological demonstration of the primary cerebellar functions.
Balance and coordination!
Walk… heel to toe.
(applause)
Backwards!
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen the Creature perform simple motor activity… but for what you will see next… we must enter… quietly… into the realm of genius.
Ladies and gentlemen…
…mesdames et messieurs…
…Damen und Herren… from what was once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues… may I now present a cultured, sophisticated… man about town!
Hit it!

Nothing! Nothing, I tell you!
Five, six, seven, eight…
Come on! Are you trying to make me look like a fool?
(booing)
Please! I beg you!
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him!
Come back! Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work!
As your creator
I command you to come back!
(screaming)
(shouting)
Chained.
Chained like a beast in a cage.
Oh, Doctor… I feel so terrible.
There's only one answer.
If I could find a way to equalise the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid… why, he'd be as right as rain.
But how?
How, before it's too late?
Oh, Frederick…
If only there was some way I could… relieve this torture you are going through.
(Freddy) Mm… mm… mm… mm…
If there was some way I could help to…
Mm… mm… mm… relieve the tension. If there was just… some way I could give you a little peace.
Doctor, I have…
Doctor?
(Freddy) What is it?
Doctor…
Where are you?
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.
I thought I told you never to interrupt me while I'm working!
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.
You see, your fiancée will be arriving any second!
What⁈ Elizabeth here tonight?
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.
I suggest you put on a tie!
Darling.
Darling!
–Surprised?
–Surprised.
–Love me?
–Love you?
Well…
–Let's turn in.
–Darling!
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired. I'll just pay the driver.
Darling!
What?
–Surprised?
–I, uh… Yes.
–Love me?
–Well…
–Well… Let's turn in.
–Ohh!
–(Freddy) Darling!
–Yes!
Say nothing, act casual.
–Ready?
–Yes… I think…
Yes.
I am a bit tired after all.
I'd like you to meet my assistants, Inga and I-gor.
How do you do?
How do you do?
–Uh… This is my financier Elizabeth.
–I'm so happy to meet you at last.
Uh… Financée.
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you… do do?
Uh, well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen in the laboratory.
We have intellectual discussions und we…
As a matter of fact, we were just having one…
–May I…?
–What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute…
Uh… I-gor, would you give me a hand with the bags?
Certainly, you take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban.
–Oh…
–(growls)
Stop that! I'm talking about the luggage.
Yes, master.
Ladies, this way.
It'll be a long night.
–If you need any help with the girls…
–(mutters) Get in there!
–Ah…
–(man laughs)
You settle down now.
Cos… we gonna be pals.
–Right?
–(snarls)
Nice and cosy.
Just like old friends.
(chuckles)
–(whimpers)
–What's the matter?
–You're afraid of this little fire?
–Mmm!
This can't hurt you.
–See? (laughs)
–Mmmmm!
Oh, some monster you are.
See, Mama was right.
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.
Mmmm!
Is they? Cos they might get hurt!
(growling)
(shouting)
Halt!
Up.
A riot is an ugly thing!
Und I think that it is just about time that we had one!
Kill the monster!
As heaven is my witness… Up. he will curse the day… that he was burn a Frankenstein!
(all) What?
I said “He will curse the day that he was born a Frankenstein!”
Yeah!
Loose⁈
Loose⁈
He's broken loose!
Do you know what that means?
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
I suppose you're right.
Of course I am.
Now come along like a good boy.
What would I do without you?
Is your room just down the hall in case I get the frights during the night?
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might… stay here with you.
Would you want me like this now?
So soon before our wedding, so near we can almost touch it?
–Yes!
–Whoa, boy!
Or… or… to wait just a little while longer when
I can give myself to you without hesitation… when I can be totally and unashamedly and legally yours?
That's a tough choice.
You're a tough guy. (kisses)
I suppose you're right.
Of course I am. I always am.
Now give me a kiss and say good night.
No tongues.
Good night, darling.
(mutters)
–Good night, sweetheart.
–(mutters)
–I love you.
–(mutters) I love you, too.
–You love me?
–(mutters)
–I love you, honey.
–(chuckles)
–Sweet dreams, darling.
–(mutters) Sweet dreams.
–Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

(monster grunts)
Where am I?
(screams) Who are you?
W-What… What are you?
–What… What are you going to do to me?
–Mmm…
Calm down.
I'm not afraid of you.
How much do you want?
My father is very rich.
You would have the world at your fingertips.
Listen. I have to be back by 11:30.
I'm expecting a very important call.
Mmm.
Speak! Speak! Why don't you speak?
What are you doing?
Oh, no, you can't be serious!
Mmm… Mmmm.
I'm af… I…
Oh, my God!
Woof!
(grunts)
L-I'm engaged.
And once he… But I didn't… It was never…
Oh, ah, oh, ah, ahh!
♫ Ah! Sweet mystery of life
♫ At last I found you
–♫ Ah! At last I know the secret of it all…
–(monster groans in ecstasy)
(arm clicks)
Shh!
(arm clicks)
Penny for your thoughts.
Mmmm!
You're incorrigible, aren't you?
Mmmm!
You little zipper-neck!
Mmmmmm!
Oh, all right.
Seven has always been my… lucky number.
Come over here, you hot monster!
Mmm!
(♫ violin in distance)
–Mmm?
–What is it?
What's the matter?
Is it that music?
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.
Where are you going? Where…
You men are all alike!
Seven or eight quick ones and you're off with the boys.
To boast and brag!
You better keep your mouth shut!
Oh, I think I love him…
Ohh!
(♫ violin tune)
(Inga) Oh! Oh, look!
He's coming back! Oh, look! The music…
Oh! Keep playing! It's the music!
It's the music that's bringing him back!
Oh… Ah…
Come on! Come on!
(music continues)
(grunts)
Come on, come on!
Oh, come on! You can do it!
(sobbing) Come on! You can do it!
(snarls)
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself!
Mmm?
You can do it! You can do it!
Please, my creation!
Quick! Catch him!
Have all the preparations been made for the transference?
Yes, Doctor.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
It's the only thing that can save him now.
You realise you're risking… both your lives?
Yes.
(clanking)
Switching off!
How… how will I know when they are done?
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.
Not one second more… or less.
(shouting)
How long now?
Two more minutes.
Eins, zwei, drei, jetzt!
Eins, zwei, drei, jetzt!
Eins, zwei, drei, jetzt!
–What's that noise?
–I don't know.
–What time is it?
–Almost time.
Oh, my God! It's the villagers!
No! No! Please!
Just another seven seconds!
No! No!
No! No! No!
–Put that man down!
–It's the monster!
–No, it can't be.
–It is.
I said “Put that man down!”
(villagers) Oh!
Undjust who do you think you are… that you order these people about?
I am the monster!
Ja. I see that you are the monster.
For as long as I can remember… people have hated me.
They looked at my face and my body… and they ran away in horror.
In my Ioneliness, I decided that if I could not inspire love, which was my deepest hope…
I would instead cause fear!
(villagers gasp)
I live… because this poor, half-crazed genius has given me life.
He alone held an image of me… as something beautiful.
And then… when it would have been easy enough to stay out of danger… he used his own body as a guinea pig… to give me a calmer brain… and a… somewhat more… sophisticated way of expressing myself.
Well, this is, of course, an entirely different situation.
As the leader of this community… may I be the first to offer you my hand… in friendship.
(sobs)
–Thank you.
–You are entirely welcome.
Und now let us all go to my house for a little sponge cake
und a little wine…
… und… Shit!
To the lumberyard!
(Freddy sings “Here Comes The Bride”)
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.
Mrs Frankenstein! What a beautiful name!
Oh, darling!
Hold on to your hat.
What?
I'll be right back.
Ooh, wow, wow, wow!
Ooh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!
(laughs)
(sings “Here Comes The Bride”)
I'm holding on to it, darling!
(Inga) Just a few more seconds!
Oh…
(hums)
(Inga singing violin tune)
(Elizabeth singing
“The Battle Hymn Of The Republic”)
Honey! Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little party too boring.
I mean, he did it just for you and he meant so well. Say you liked it.
Mm-hm.
Honey, did you see?
I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts… and the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Here I come!
(hisses like a cat)
(snorts)
(imitates cymbal)
(singing)
(sizzling)
Mmm.
Ohhh…
Mmmm!
(Inga) Mmmm!
The feeling is mutual.
You know, it's a puzzlement.
There's something I've always wanted to ask you about that operation.
You know in the transference part…
The monster got part of your wonderful brain, but what did you ever get from him?
Mmmmmmm!
(Inga) No! Ohh! I don't believe…
Ooh! Ow! Oh! Oh!
♫ Ah! Sweet mystery of life
♫ At last I found you

ENGLISH HOH
Come, come.
Are you authorized to dress him like that?
Oh, yes, sir.
- A circus ape, huh?
- The only one to have been trained as a bareback rider in the entire history of the circus.
- Circuses are past history.
- Not while I live and breathe.
- All right, Señor Armando. Go ahead.
- Thank you.
Come, come.
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.
But try to walk a little more like a primitive chimpanzee.
Your arms should move up and down from the shoulder... like so.
Yes, that's better.
After 20 years, you've picked up evolved habits from me.
That could be dangerous. Even fatal.
- Armando, I don't understand.
- Listen to me, Caesar.
There can be only one talking chimpanzee on Earth.
The child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira, who came to us years ago out of the future and were murdered for fear that one distant day apes might dominate the human race.
Yeah, but outside of you, nobody even knows I exist.
And we must keep it that way, for the fear remains.
The mere fact of your existence would be regarded as a great threat to mankind.
Come. Come.
Attention, this is the watch commander.
Disperse apes gathering in the mall.
Repeat: disperse apes gathering in the mall.

Repeat: no citation or fine in this...
But how did it happen?
Go! Go!
No! No!
Go! You go!
But you said humans treated apes like pets.
- They did, in the beginning.
- They've made slaves of them!
They all died within a few months, eight years ago.
Every dog and cat in the world.
It was like a plague.
The disease that killed them was a virus brought back from space by an astronaut.
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- We were immune.
And so, it was discovered, were simians, even the smallest ones.
That's how it began.
Humans wanting little household pets to replace the ones they had lost.
Then, when people realized how quick they were to learn, how easy to train, the pets became larger, and larger, until now...
It's monstrous.
Now you understand why I've kept you away.
Yes, Lisa.
A Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley.
No!
Lisa.
Yes?
Could you possibly be so kind as to display it in your window?
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.
The labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in ten minutes.
Repeat: the labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in ten minutes.
Thank you, Frank.
Funny. Now that I know they won't kill me, I don't enjoy them.
Well, for heaven's sakes! A circus!
Home, Lisa.
- Yes?
- Oh, I was wondering, would you be kind enough to display a couple of these posters?
- Stop it!
- No, Zelda! No!
Home, Zelda.
I'm so sorry, Mrs Riley. I'll have someone to comb you out in a minute.
I wanna be combed out now.
I have a luncheon.
- Thursday, then.
- Thursday.
I... I forgot the waiter and I'm all out of raisins.
- Take mine.
- Thank you.
You're overtipping.
No! No! No!
And I told them to condition him to fire.
Attention. The labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in five minutes.
Repeat: the labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in five minutes.
Failure to comply with this order can result in a one-year suspension of your right to bargain collectively.
- What's his job?
- He's a messenger.
For the governor, so get!
No! No! No!
- Stop that at once! All of you!
- Yes, sir, Mr MacDonald. We were just...
I saw what you were doing. Now sedate the animal and get him out of here.
- Who the hell's that?
- The governor's number-one assistant.
- He love apes or something?
- Don't it figure?
Hold him.
Lousy human bastards!
Who said that?
I did.
He's a performing ape for my circus.
- A talking ape?
- No! No, no.
No, that's impossible.
It was I who spoke.
It didn't sound like your voice.
Yell "Lousy human bastards."
- That's not what I said.
- That's what I heard.
Now, look, mister, you yell "Lousy human bastards."
- Lousy human bastards.
- We said yell!
Lousy human bastards!
- Yeah, yeah. Could be.
- I don't think so.
- It's right. The ape spoke.
- Yeah!
No! No, they're mistaken.
I admit my behavior was inexcusable and I am deeply sorry.
I think we better take him to headquarters for interrogation.
Guard!
Move him on.
- Armando, forgive me.
- Oh, no, no.
You only said aloud what I was thinking.
I'm sorry. I was so angry.
I might have bluffed it through if you hadn't run away.
Now they suspect you of understanding all that was said.
- Armando, let's go back to the circus.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, please.
- No, that's the first place they'll look.
Here's what we'll do. I'll go to the police.
- Oh, no, no!
- It's the only way!
I'll say that... that I couldn't find you.
That... you've run away before.
- That big cities frighten you.
- But, Armando, where would I go?
You wait right here!
If this works, I'll be back by nightfall.
- But what if they don't let you go?
- Oh, they will. They will.
But just in case, if I am not back by then...
Now, these steps go down to a tunnel that leads to the harbor.
Cargoes of apes are frequently unloaded at night.
- You must try to infiltrate one of them.
- But, Armando...
Apes imported from overseas arrive naked, so you'll have to get rid of these clothes.
- Well, I don't want to.
- We must have an alternate plan!
Right now, the only safe hiding place for you is among your own kind.
I shouldn't be long.
Why would you say "human"?
"Human." That's a very odd thing for another human being to say.
I didn't say "human," Mr Governor.
I said "inhuman."
Lousy inhuman bastards.
And by the blessed St Francis, who loved all animals, I meant it.
- You see, I run a circus...
- We know that.
- From 20 years back.
- Since the talking apes arrived on Earth and conceived a baby whose survival could have threatened the future of the human race.
Mr Governor, I understand the baby was shot dead with its parents.
Or so it was believed, Mr MacDonald.
However, since this morning,
I'm beginning to wonder if they shot the right baby.
The apes could have switched their baby with one from the zoo.
Or perhaps a circus.
Surely, Mr Governor, you can't be serious!
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.
These are the recommendations made to the then president of the United States by the chairman of the Presidential Committee.
And we believe that the male and female talking apes, Cornelius and Zira, have come to us out of the future.
We believe their spoken testimony, that some 2,000 years hence, their descendants will have all but exterminated the human race from Earth.
And we know that the female ape is now pregnant with child.
The commission therefore recommends that the birth of the female ape's unborn child should be prevented and that both the male and the female should be rendered incapable of begetting another.
But, Mr Governor, every zoo, public and private, was searched by the police, and every circus, including my own.
- But a small chimpanzee was found.
- The only one ever to be born in a circus, and legally certified to have been born a month - a month - before the talking apes arrived on earth.
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew. I've searched everywhere.
Señor Armando!
Let me remind you... of the seriousness of our problem.
Now.
Your circus travels mainly in the provinces?
Yes, sir.
Then, undoubtedly, you are unaware of the rising tide of disobedience, the outright defiance, among the servant apes in our cities.
Mr Governor, on investigation, many of the offenses have been proved minor.
The ape killed while trying to escape from the city last night,
- would you call his offense minor?
- No, sir, I would not.
He physically assaulted his own master.
But only after what must have been severe provocation.
The ape's body was covered with welts and bruises inflicted by a beating.
Which he no doubt richly deserved.
How many more of them out there are just like that ape?
All burning with resentment.
Or waiting. Waiting for an ape with enough intelligence, with enough will, to lead them.
Waiting for an ape who can think.
Who can talk.
Señor Armando, has your ape ever talked or shown any signs of being articulate in your presence?
Never in my presence, or anyone else's.
You can question my circus hands.
We intend to.
Meanwhile, you will remain in custody.
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo, now arriving at gate number two.
Shipment 509, A for Africa, ex-French Cameroons, now arriving at number four gate.
After fingerprinting, shipment 507,
I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo, will proceed direct to conditioning cage 90.

Immigration personnel are reminded that, until further notice, police have requested one additional copy of all chimpanzee fingerprints for their files.
Repeat: immigration personnel are reminded that until further notice, police have requested one additional copy of all chimpanzee fingerprints for their files.
Do!
Next!
No!
They're a bit uppity.
I haven't fed them yet.
Come on!
Switch off.
Switch on.
Have you seen this ape before?
Isn't it... Cornelius?
I thought you didn't know him?
B-But you told me yourself.
T-The talking ape that was murdered...
- Executed.
- Executed.
- Would you say there's a resemblance?
- Oh, no.
Look very carefully.
- Like father, like son, eh?
- No. No!
You'd do well to cooperate with us. l-I... Could I...
Could I please have a glass of water?
Do.
No!
Do.
No! No!
Do.
Attention. Training Control.
Four females have arrived for insemination - three gorillas and one chimpanzee.
Please select four superior males - three gorillas, one chimpanzee - and send them to the breeding annex immediately.
254 process for auction.
Yes, ma"am, for immediate sale.
One male gorilla, age seven.
Fully conditioned bedmaker, grade A.
Yes, yes.
You will be credited after auction.
So you're a member of Breck's party.
Now I understand how you got those big contracts.
He's good for this country.
Good for all of us.
You really think he's gonna make it?
I don't know of anyone who could stop him.
Bring up lot eight!
Lot eight! One male chimpanzee!
In early prime and perfect physical condition.
Take a good look at this specimen.
This has to be the buy of the afternoon.
Early prime. Perfect physical condition.
Under observation, he appeared so familiar, obedient, docile and intelligent with humans that conditioning was not considered necessary.
But it certainly can be provided on request.
We're gonna start the bidding on this specimen at $800.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, what am I bid on this superb specimen?
Bidding starts at 800. 800.
What am I bid for this superb specimen?
- 850 over here. Do I hear nine?
- I hear nine over there! Nine over there!
- 950 over there on the end.
- 1,000 from the gentleman on the end. $1,000.
- 1100 over here.
- 1150 in the back row.
- $1200 from this gentleman.
Going to this gentleman. Going! Going...
- Buy him.
1500 from Mr MacDonald!
For His Excellency, Governor Breck.
Going! Going!
Gone!
Come.
It's very good, Morgan, but simplify the wording in that last paragraph.
Sir, we've received a disappointing report on the automated sanitation plan.
- You have a meeting with Curfew Control.
- Cancel it, Miss Greer.
These figures, did you double-check them?
- Yes, sir.
- Triple-check them!
- Come.
- Hold all calls, Miss Greer.
Here's the IQ profile on all apes tested within the last four weeks.
It's risen by 32/3 points.
Uh-huh! Show Mr MacDonald.
He thinks I'm imagining things.
I assembled that.
You summarized the wrong part.
So their output has increased about the same percentage, which I thought the governor might regard as good news.
It's all right. We'll go over that later.
No.
Watch.
Do.
No, no, no. Clean. Clean.
It seems the little fella's not so bright after all.
No. But brightness has never been encouraged amongst slaves.
Oh, don't be so touchy, Mr MacDonald.
All of us were slaves once, in one sense of the word or another.
If you feel the ape's unsatisfactory, we can have him reconditioned.
- That isn't necessary.
- You're quite right, Mr MacDonald.
But not for any of your bleeding-heart reasons.
Reconditioning. That's all any of you ever think of, isn't it?
Don't you realize, if we were to take every ape who disobeyed an order and sent him back for reconditioning, Ape
Management would become overcrowded.
- It's the only thing that has any effect.
- Just makes them worse.
Some of them couldn't be worse.
I've been having a comprehensive list compiled.
- Mr Governor.
- Yes, what is it you want?
It's your meeting with the Defense Council.
I'll be along in a moment.
- Defense Council?
- I'll tell you about it later.
Is this related to the list you mentioned?
You'll be given full details, Mr MacDonald.
Meanwhile, we're going to set a good example and recondition this fella ourselves.
- We haven't named him yet, have we?
- No, Mr Breck.
I'm going to revive a charming tradition established in her lifetime by my dear wife, and let you name yourself.
'Caesar.' A king.
Yes?
They're waiting for you in the council chamber.
I don't think we'll ever make a bartender out of Caesar.
Have him detailed to the Command Post.
No!
Attention.
There is a report of unescorted apes in the Plaza. Investigate.
Can I help you, Mr MacDonald?
This ape's assigned to the Command Post.
- What's his name, sir?
- Caesar.
Start him off in the files.
Low-priority traffic.
Yes, sir.
Do!
Lisa. Lisa!
Ah! Señor Armando!
- This way, señor. This way.
- Sit down, sit down.
We have good news for you.
- Good news?
- Yes. You're to be released.
Inspector Hoskyns and I believe that your ape is not the child of the talking chimpanzees.
- You found him?
- Not yet, but he'll turn up sooner or later.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience we had to cause you.
Do forgive us, but it was unavoidable.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Then I'm... I'm free to go?
Oh, as soon as you sign this sworn declaration.
What does it say?
Only what you've been telling us all along.
The circus ape is incapable of human speech and, to the best of your knowledge, he's never uttered a word.
Certainly.
Excellent. Now we'll check this with the authenticator, then you'll be free to go.
The... authenticator?
It's just a formality. Sit back down, please. It'll just take a moment.
What does the authenticator do?
Makes people tell the truth.
It's quite painless.
For example, you said you first heard the name Cornelius in this office.
Was that true?
- No.
- Now, there! You see?
That's not a bad black mark against you.
You probably heard it somewhere else before.
Now. About your statement, sworn statement, that the circus ape is incapable of speech.
- No. I won't submit to this.
- You will, Señor Armando!
I have done nothing wrong!
You are treating me like a criminal!
Sit back, please.
No! No, no.
- Guard!
- No!
No!
I knew that circus owner was lying.
They insist he fell to his death accidentally.
While trying to escape!
He knew he'd been exposed.
Attention. Attention.
Last night, several security forces apprehended and placed in custody a number of servant apes from widely scattered households throughout the city, who had gathered clandestinely in the unused building on the outskirts of the East Sector.
Property owners are firmly warned that they bear sole responsibility for the behavior and whereabouts of their servant apes.
Frank!
Frank.
No!
"One dozen steaks, New York cut, for Mrs Van Thal."
Add one gallon of... No.
Two gallons of kerosene.
Mr Governor.
The latest ape-disobedience figures.
There's been a marked increase in property damage.
Couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr MacDonald!
Arrange for distribution of the Achilles list.
Copies to each police precinct. Details are to be left to the individual commanders, but I want every ape on that list delivered to the reconditioning center by 0600 tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry, 309. The cages are full.
We cannot accommodate any new intakes until after Tuesday's auction.
"Collect one repaired Colt 45."
And...
100 rounds ammunition.
The Achilles list, Mr MacDonald, referring to our Achilles heel, contains the name of every ape who, over the past year, has been overtly disobedient.
The charge against them is nonsense.
It will do for my purposes.
They constitute the hard core of our problem and I'm going to crush them once and for all!
Sir, you will only further aggravate the problem.
This action is folly, and I wish to protest it in the strongest possible terms.
Very well, Mr MacDonald.
Your protest has been duly noted.
From now on, you have but one assignment: to find that talking ape.
- What is this? A red alert?
- Sort of.
Ape Management computer's come up with an intriguing error.
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, comprised three orangutans and one chimpanzee.
- So?
- There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.
Yes, sir.
State Security Chief
Inspector Kolp on line three.
Yes, Inspector.
Give me the Indonesia file for last month.
That's 507, ex-Borneo.
Right, Inspector. Let me check.
507, ex-Borneo. Yes, sir. That chimpanzee was sold to Governor Breck.
Good God! Just as I first thought.
We've had him under our noses all the time!
Sir, I'm willing to have the ape executed immediately on your verbal orders alone.
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.
Get Mr MacDonald at the Command Post.
However, suppose he can speak but won't?
I don't understand.
The chief inspector means there'd still be a doubt.
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut, the case stays open.
We'd like to close the file.
You shall. I promise you.
Reconditioning applications have to be made out in triplicate.
MacDonald speaking. Yes, sir.
You want me to turn Caesar over to Inspector Kolp?
Is he on your Achilles list?
Mr MacDonald, do not question an order.
No, sir, I'm not questioning the order. It's just that...
Well, I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.
Yes, sir. I'll do just as you say.
Come.
- No, this goes to Traffic Control!
- Take it easy. They can't read.
Not yet, they can't.
Do.
Mr MacDonald, are you near a phone?
Mr MacDonald, it is imperative that you get to a phone!
Come in, Mr MacDonald! Do you hear me?
Get to a phone and come in!
Now, come in!
- Yes, Mr Governor.
- Kolp is on his way down with the police.
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir. I'll keep a look out.
Notify me the moment he's handed over to them.
Yes, sir.
I wish...
I wish there was some way we could communicate, so you'd understand that I...
I understand,
Mr MacDonald.
Yes, I... I'm the one they're looking for.
I never believed it.
I... I thought you were a myth.
Well, I'm not.
But I will tell you something that is.
The belief that human beings are kind...
No, Caesar. There are some...
A handful, perhaps, but not most of them.
They won't learn to be kind until we force them to.
We can't do that until we are free.
How do you propose to gain this freedom?
By the only means left to us.
- Revolution.
- But... it's doomed to failure!
Perhaps... this time.
- And the next.
- Maybe.
- But you'll keep trying.
- You, above everyone else, should understand.
We cannot be free until we have power.
How else can we achieve it?
Go.
Ah, Mr MacDonald, I have an order from the governor to take Caesar into custody.
I know. I've been looking for him.
- He's not in the Command Post?
- No.
Issue an order to round up all unaccompanied apes.
I still don't see why he made a run for it.
It's really quite simple, Mr MacDonald.
The ape has intelligence.
He knew that his friend Armando was dead.
He assumed the man first betrayed him under torture.
But we don't do that... to humans.
Now.
Talk!
Have...
Ha... Have pity.
That's incredible! Well, there's your proof!
We're convinced, Mr Governor.
It's fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
Have him say something else.
You heard the governor.
Answer!
- We could persuade him.
- No.
He's not responsible for what he is.
Still, seeing him there, it's like looking at some deadly bacillus and... knowing you've got it bottled up at last.
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.
I have an authorization here from the governor to have this beast destroyed.
I'll notify the vet to inject him.
- He is wired for electrocution, isn't he?
- Oh, yes.
Well, then, electrocute him. Now.
- He's dead.
- Good.
- Good work, Inspector.
- What happened to Mr MacDonald?
I'm afraid his sensibility...
Ah, there you are!
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over.
Shall we go back to work?
Lisa.
All keepers and handlers, attention. Attention!
All keepers and handlers.
There is $50,000 worth of apes in jeopardy.
Get them out of here... alive!
Yes. Commander, I understand the situation.
Assemble as large a force as you can and follow them.
Mobilize all security forces, police, militia and reserve defense units.
See that every entrance into the city is cordoned off.
Will control methods include tear gas and sedation darts?
There will be but one control method: shoot to kill.
A small group of apes, scheduled for intensive reconditioning, have escaped from Ape Management.
Until they've been rounded up by the police, all citizens are requested to remain indoors.
A further announcement will be made as soon as recapture is effected.
And, I guess, here it is.
Ape Management is in the hands of the apes.
Many officials are either dead or held hostage.
The main band of rioting apes are at this very moment marching on the city.
It's been established that the ape mob is under the command of a supernormally intelligent chimpanzee who has... acquired the power of speech.
That idiot!
Get out a retraction immediately!
Announce that the talking ape has been put to death!
...the child of the two talking chimpanzees, Cornelius and Zira, who came to us from outer space 20 years ago.
As such, he constitutes a threat to the future of the whole human race.
Governor Breck has just issued this order to all civilians: go to your homes.
Stay in your home and lock your doors.
Above all, do not panic.
Repeat: go to your homes.
Stay in your homes and lock your doors.
The situation can be kept under control provided our defense forces are given complete freedom of movement.
No! Go back!
No! No!
Go home!
Back!
Ready.
Aim.
Fire!
Ready.
Aim.
Fire!
Yes.
Yes. Understood.
Riot Control say the apes have broken through the cordon.
Advance units are approaching the Plaza.
Order units four and six into action immediately.
Riot Control.
No!
They've reached the Plaza.
- Good God! They're armed!
- And organized.
- No! Home!
- Don't plead with them, you idiot!
Ready!
No!
Home!
Aim!
Fire!
What's the trouble down there?
Like wild animals, they're smelling blood.
My God! There's more!
- They're inside the building.
- Alert all security posts!
- Right, sir.
- No! No!
The circuits are dead.
Take a message. To Riot Control, urgent.
Command Post under attack!
Repeat: Command Post under attack!
It won't work, sir.
No!
But how? How? They don't have the intelligence to use such tools!
Shoot them! Shoot them all!
This is the Communication Center.
We have no defense.
If we lose this battle, that's the end of the world as we know it!
We will have proved ourselves inferior. Weak!
And all the groveling cowards left alive when the battle is over will be the weakest of all!
This will be the end of human civilization and the world will belong to a planet of apes!
No! No, go. Go!
Caesar!
Your servant.
Your creature. Your animal!
But I saw you die.
The king is dead. Long live the king!
Tell me, Breck, before you die, how do we differ from the dogs and cats you and your kind used to love?
Why did you turn us from pets into slaves?
Because your kind were once our ancestors.
Man was born of the ape.
And there's still an ape curled up inside of every man.
The beast that must be whipped into submission.
The savage that has to be shackled in chains.
You are that beast, Caesar. You taint us.
You poison our guts!
When...
When we hate you, we're... we're hating the dark side of ourselves.
Take him.
Go!
Caesar!
Caesar. This is not how it was to be.
In your view or mine?
Violence prolongs hate.
Hate prolongs violence.
By what right are you spilling blood?
The slave's right to punish his persecutors.
Caesar. I, a descendant of slaves, am asking you to show humanity.
But I was not born human.
I know. The child of the evolved apes.
Whose children shall rule the Earth.
For better or for worse?
Do you think it could be worse?
Do you think this riot will win freedom for all your kind?
- By tomorrow...
- By tomorrow, it will be too late.
A tiny, mindless insect like the emperor moth can communicate with another
- over a distance of 80 miles.
- An emperor ape might do slightly better?
Slightly?
What you have seen here today, apes on the five continents will be imitating tomorrow.
With knives against guns? With kerosene cans against flame-throwers?
Where there is fire, there is smoke.
And, in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of man's downfall.
The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind.
The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble.
When the sea is a dead sea and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity.
And we shall build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans, except to serve our ends.
And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty!
And that day is upon you... now!
But now...
Now we will put away our hatred.
Now we will put down our weapons.
We have passed through the Night of the Fires.
And those who were our masters are now our servants.
And we, who are not human, can afford to be humane.
Destiny is the will of God.
And, if it is man's destiny to be dominated, it is God's will that he be dominated with compassion and understanding.
So, cast out your vengeance.
Tonight, we have seen
Minus five, minus four... three, two, one.
Ignition.
We have separation.
What'll she do?
Stardust's mission is to explore the stars and planets of this galaxy and beyond.
I know that. I mean how fast will she go?
Stardust should definitely travel faster than light, which, as you all know, is 186,283.4 miles per second.
Wow! That's really pouring the coal to it!
We won't be using coal, Senator Milburn.
Stardust will actually collect atoms while in flight, ionising the medium ahead of the craft and guiding the ions into the intake area here.
This can be accomplished by the use of intense magnetic fields.
In just four and a half years, the craft could reach our nearest star, Alpha Centauri.
Aren't such speeds supposed to turn back the clock or develop a time warp?
This flight will put Einstein's
Theory of Relativity to the test.
The crew won't be aware of time passing.
- Did you say "crew"?
The ship is designed for two crewmen.
- You can stop right there, Doctor.
You intend to put fine young American men into that untried contraption and shoot 'em out into some never-never land?
That's oversimplifying it, but yes.
- Oh, no, you're not.
Not while I'm chairman of the Finance Ways and Means Committee of this project.
Not with the elections coming up.
- We have women in the space programme.
Women? No, sir.
Come up with another brainstorm, Doctor, or that baby's never gonna get out of this room.
Trimble here.
- What are you doing?
Transcendental meditation, sir.
- I'm taking you off that project.
You're going onto Humanoids.
- Human...?
Humanoids?
- I want a robot that walks, talks, the works!
Yes, sir!
It's a method of transportation known as an airplane.
Man uses it to fly through the air.
This is a woman. I am a man. You are modelled after me. She is the opposite sex.
We named him Hermes after the Greek god of speed.
We've managed to simulate an ordinary, average human body.
Not only does Hermes look human, but he has human reflexes and responses to a given situation.
Such as.
How do you feel, Hermes?
- (BLEEPS) Fine, thank you.
He talks, he reacts to shapes and stimuli.
He'll relay information on human anatomical compensation to interstellar flight almost as well as man.
Please, gentlemen, step up and say hello!
Well, Senator, we did it.
(TV) This spacecraft will travel farther and
faster than anything yet conceived by man. 
Stardust is designed and equipped
for exploration on distant planets. 
We're informed by Ground Control
that all systems are green,
but we're on hold
due to a technical problem. 
Hermes, the President is waiting.
What's holding things up?
I've got important guests out there.
Hermes doesn't want to go. He's afraid.
- Afraid? What's he afraid of?
That he won't ever come back.
It's possible. Hermes has thought the problem through.
Walter's asking about the delay.
Tell him it's a technical problem we're taking care of.
Zimmerman, I approved this contraption.
My committee chairmanship is riding on it.
You blow it and your budget next year won't be enough to build a paper plane!
Smedley, get Trimble to try and talk some sense into it.
Snap it up! There's a storm front coming in!
- Yes, sir.
Hermes, Hermes, I wanna talk to you.
Close the hatch.
What is this about you not wanting to go?
I'm afraid I'm never coming back.
- Of course you are.
What a silly thing to say.
Get into your nice white space suit.
Dr Zimmerman thinks it'll be good publicity.
You've put me in an embarrassing position.
What are people gonna think if we have to scrub this mission because you're afraid?
Come on, just put this thing on.
What's this?
Hermes!
Well, 30 years is 30 years, I suppose.
We'll forget the suit. Hermes, we've spent a lot of time and money on this mission...
Is that you, Hermes?
- No, it's Tom Trimble.
Get out of the picture, Trimble, you look awful. Where Hermes?
He's here. I think he's hurt, broken.
You've got to get us down!
Impossible, Trimble. We can't abort this mission now. Make yourself comfortable.
For 30 years?!
- Oh, it won't seem that long to you.
10 at the outside.
- I have agoraphobia and it's getting worse!
Relax or we can't get true readings on you.
Something else, Trimble.
When you get back, there'll be a surprise in your pay envelope. How's that sound?
Like a posthumous award!
- Ahem. Well, I have to go.
You won't have much to report until you reach star Vega, but keep in touch.
But...
Hermes, do something!
We've got to get this thing down!
Do what you were programmed to do.
I'm sorry. Your pulse staticizer probably got jammed when you bumped your head.
Don't worry, it's nothing that a soldering iron and a screwdriver can't fix.
I gotta get this thing into orbit.
Oh, no!
Oh, boy, the power's failing.
No... it's the sun rising and setting!
I gotta slow this thing down.
We'd best spend the night here, then get an early start for Camelot in the morning.
What was that?!
It's after us!
Shh!
Why would it stick its tongue out at us?
What's that?
Now you've done it! Fly for your life!
Oh, please, take me instead!
No contest! But, lady, you wouldn't believe what I've been through so... Where am I?
Bodney-on-Trent, Langdale Walk,
Bennington Green, Cornwall, England the year of our Lord 508... monster.
508! It really works!
You really can turn back the clock!
Here.
Albert Einstein, you really knew your stuff!
What is it you're after?
I have to figure a way to get back into orbit, rewind the clock and get back to the Cape.
Mm. Well, we must be going now.
Where?
- Camelot. It's four leagues... monster.
Why do you keep calling me monster?
- You have no face and no ears.
If I can get this off,
I'll show you what I look like inside.
Oh, I'm not that curious to look inside you.
Please, can we go now?
Wait! Who's in charge here?
I suppose I am. Mum died of the plague three years past.
And this is Father. Come on.
What's that she's consorting with?
- 'Tis too big for a troll.
Yet it's plainly not aggressive.
Are you certain you want to go to the castle?
They aren't always friendly to mons...
Strangers.
- I gotta get outta here.
Maybe in Camelot I can find a person who doesn't think I'm from outer space.
And where do you come from?
- Hey, easy with the stick!
I friend!
- Aiding fugitives is punishable by death.
I wasn't aiding anybody...
- You are my prisoner! Do you contest that?
No. Discretion is the better part of valour.
Very good. I must tell that to the King.
Lead on, prisoner, to Camelot!
Go on with your story.
- Well...
.. Sir Mordred wanted Father's land, but Father refused to give it up.
He believes that every freeman should own the land he works, isn't that right, Father?
What is that? They keep doing that.
They think you're a goblin.
Goblins come out in the evening.
Do you still think I'm a goblin?
- Heaven forbid.
I never thought it for an instant.
Goblins don't fly.
When did your father become a goose?
A gander!
- I don't believe it!
Oh, it's quite true.
- No, I mean the castle. That's Camelot?
It is.
- King Arthur's Camelot?
Come on.
When I returned from Haymarket, the gander was in Father's chair eating crumbs off the table.
So you figured it was your old man transformed by some evil spell.
What else could it be? Father was nowhere to be seen and the door was locked.
If only I could see Merlin.
I know he could make Father himself again.
Merlin? The magician?
- Yes.
How would the likes of you know Merlin?
- Oh, just by reputation.
Now, most gracious King Arthur,
I shall transform this pink-eyed white rat into vintage red wine.
If I were to turn you to stone, Sir Gawain, possibly I might continue uninterrupted.
Rattray... vanishay!
Et coldon hideway!
Howmay!
By my soul! That's wine! Wine!
And that concludes my dazzling display of black magic for this evening. Your servant.
Fear not, I have it subdued.
Your Majesty.
- Mordred, what have you in tow this time?
King Arthur, after the ceremony, I...
Your Majesty, with intention to rob, this creature and five like it fell upon me in the forest with firebrands and lances!
I despatched the others and spared this one as a curio for Your Majesty.
The head resembles a bug and I've not seen tentacles like that on a man creature before.
It's this space suit, Your Majesty.
In sand shoes, slacks and a blazer...
What are your plans for it? It's not large enough for a beast of burden.
I was thinking more along the lines of a burning.
Excellent suggestion, Mordred!
With Your Majesty's approval,
I could do something out of the ordinary with this creature.
What do you mean, burning?
Burn who? For what?
Burning is a fit punishment for the offence.
- Very well, then. A burning early tomorrow.
(PEOPLE) Burn him!
- When do I get my turn to bat? Wait, wait!
Wait! Let him speak.
I would know something of your plan.
- I could sell this better without this helmet.
Do you have a wrench around here?
- Wench? Wench?
We've several wenches. We don't usually make them available to captive... things.
However... Peg! Tend to its needs!
Within reason!
I think if you could get a head lock around here and twist...
Don't worry, you won't feel a...
That face!
Hi.
Er... you wanted to hear about my plan.
I suppose I should start with a little history or, in your case, a little future.
In... 1492, a man named Christopher Columbus is going to discover America.
America is another continent approximately 3,000 miles from here.
Columbus's ships will be named the Niña, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.
A lot of people think that Leif Ericson got there first. I don't know.
All I know is that all the banks are closed on Columbus Day, not Ericson Day.
Ericson Day!
So we jump a couple of hundred years...
So when Stardust blasted off prematurely,
I was trapped inside.
You recall my explanation of the law of gravity and how that theory is applied to orbiting objects.
Well, Stardust...
- Yes, yes, we all recall Madame Curie...
.. and Fulton's steamboat... and that imbecile who flew kites in the rain!
Just think what we could do with the likes of them today if they were not just the creation of your disordered BRAIN!
Those are the straight goods. It happened just the way I told you or, at least, it will!
And you seriously expect us to believe that you were alive 1,400 years from now?
Then why aren't you 1,400 years old?
- Well, that's a little difficult to explain.
With your permission, may I suggest we put an end to this travesty?
Agreed. Take him away.
- Wait a minute!
I can tell you how the Crusades come out!
Mordred tries to take over your kingdom!
Maybe with a little historical licence,
I can help you out, King!
I'm very good with a screwdriver!
Just listen...
Food for Sir Mordred's latest prisoner!
Sandi... over here.
Thing... I hardly recognised you without your head on!
Stop with that "thing" thing. This is getting serious. I'm gonna be burned at the stake.
Can you believe that?
Me, burned at the stake?
I heard. But, see, I've brought you something.
Clarence's hammer - to free you from your chains.
You did all this for me?
- Well, you've harmed no one.
You should be set free to return to your natural habitat.
You mean the USA.
- Yeah, mm.
Or the sky. Wherever you like it best.
When you get an idea in your head, you don't let go. Look at me closely.
Do I look like a monster to you?
Not any more, but you did when you came out of your shell breathing smoke.
No, that was steam. It was as hot as an oven in the capsule when I re-entered.
How does an ordinary man live in an oven?
This is a special suit. It resists heat.
Its even got its own temperature control - like a built-in air-conditioning system.
Now, between that and the asbestos mater...
Asbestos material!
I need a match.
Didn't that hurt?
- No, no. Here, hold that candle.
And that doesn't either!
I must go now.
- No reason to be afraid. I'll be safe.
This material is a mixture of a silicate of calcium and magnesium.
It doesn't conduct heat!
Now do you understand?
Of course.
No, Sandi, I'm no different from you or anybody... Ow!
What was that?
- Next room.
The man's got growing pains.
It can't last for long.
Are you all right?
Who... Who asks such a stupid question?
Tom Trimble. I'm Sir Mordred's prisoner.
- Satan himself.
He wants me to confess I killed one of his deer.
If I confess to his charge...
.. I must forfeit all my properties to him.
It is my only legacy to my beloved daughter Alisande.
Are you Sandi's father?
- You... You know my daughter?
Yes, yes!
- Poor child must think me dead.
Actually she thinks you're a goose.
- A goose? Her own father?
She must get word to our sovereign.
- Don't worry.
After I'm burned,
I'll tell the whole story to King Arthur.
Would it not show more foresight to tell him BEFORE the burning?
I had troubling dreams when I did sleep, Gawain.
Tell me, was it the Wright brothers who discovered radio?
I think not, Your Highness. That was.. er...
That was Babe Ruth.
And Uncle Milty was... will be the first man to fly, correct?
I believe he invents the horseless carriage, but I dozed off through that period.
He could be trained to be a court jester.
He tells the best lies we've ever heard.
True.
- Better even than Sir Mordred's.
How's that, Sir Gawain?
- When I say better, I mean different.
You tell the most excellent lies, Sir Mordred.
Of course you do!
Executioners, by His Majesty's gracious command, bring in the creature!
Look at the size of him!
- He's eaten a hearty last meal.
Clarence, could you reach inside my leg there?
Hold that till I get back.
There's some very good articles in it.
It is most brave. Isn't it, Father?
Er, King Arthur, could I please have a word with you after the burning?
After the burning?
Well, if he feels up to it, I see no harm.
Make sure it is bound securely.
(THE SUIT WHINES
LIKE A DEFLATING BALLOON)
It would appear it's suddenly wasting away.
Proceed while there's something left to burn.
Start the burning!
By my...!
Mordred, you're rarely at a loss for words.
What say'st thou?
Plainly he comes from hardy stock,
Your Majesty.
Merlin, fan the flames!
Merlin.
Do you think this creature has unholy powers?
Impossible!
I mean, Your Majesty, my liege,
I may have underestimated his capacities.
I'd rather he was with us than against us.
- We've already abused that option.
I can't have it roaming the halls of Camelot.
Mordred, it was all your doing.
And I should be the thing's undoing.
There is nothing to fear!
We have yet to see how this creature resists cold steel! Page!
Go inside and fetch my sword.
- Me?!
Thou jests!
- Thou art on thin ice! I bid thee obey!
You're in trouble. Mordred's looking for you.
- I must find the monster and help him.
He cannot defend himself against weapons, that we have seen.
What concern is that of yours?
- Clarence, perhaps he isn't a monster.
Did you see that?
With these eyes, but my heart refuses to accept it.
Come... we must help it escape.
Come on, Father.
Sandi, I can explain everything! I saw...
- There's no time!
Sir Mordred threatens to run you through!
- Clarence, lend a hand here.
(MORDRED) Page, I would have my sword!
- Is there a back door? A laundry chute?
No, and only the King can order the drawbridge lowered.
(MORDRED) I'll butcher that creature like a hung beef!
It's locked!
Surely you can defend yourself in some way!
Do you bite?
We have the finest selection of swords in the country here. Try one.
Isn't that King's Arthur's sword?
Oh, I knew it! Your heart is pure.
There's no time for that now. You'd better leave before Mordred gets here.
I couldn't bear to watch anyway.
Clarence, I don't know how to fight!
I must deliver Sir Mordred his sword.
If he thought I'd befriended thee...
- Listen, you have to help me!
Impossible! Mordred would boil me in oil!
- He'll never know!
I'm a lowly page, but I'll do what I can.
- Great! Now, which way is north?
Got a hammer?
- Only in the blacksmith's shop.
Anything'll do.
I'm gonna magnetise the sword.
"Magetise" it...?
- A solid blow will rearrange its molecules.
Hurry up, come on!
What delays thee, page? I'll skewer thee!
He wenteth that way.
It's taken refuse in the Great Hall.
- Where it will see its last moments.
Ahh!
It has taken on rust.
I have been putting my lance to use.
Mordred, please,
I have a knack for this sort of thing.
Are you going to be long?
You're holding up the midday meal.
I beg your indulgence, sire...
.. but my sword and I seem to be at odds.
He seems quite attached to it.
I hate to impose on you, Your Majesty, but would you be so kind?
I'll fillet thee like a flounder!
May I remind you, Mordred, that you are a knight of the Round Table?
Ohhh!
If you'd be so kind.
- Is that fair?
A good knight must use his own judgement.
- Sir Mordred is one of our own.
Release it quickly!
- I find it impossible to oblige you.
It is metal it attracts.
Touch not metal with the blade.
- His head be not of metal!
Guards, stay fast!
Now, Mordred, put an end to it!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Oh, dear, what a pity.
Sir Lancelot! Is he here?
- He's taken leave.
Something about rescuing a maiden.
- I heard he was into that.
Sir BrandeI.
Ah... here's Sir Galahad.
- Sir Galahad.
I can't wait to get home and tell the folks about this.
I've gotta get back to the 20th century.
- You keep saying that.
How can one go back to the 20th century when we're in the 6th?
I'll figure it out.
- Tell me, Tom, please.
I promise not to let it go past this room.
Where exactly do you come from?
Do you remember when I told you about Columbus...
Wait, wait, wait. I can't go into that again.
Bugs, the jitter, Beatles, the throw rocks...
- No, no, play rock.
You'll understand better when I show you Stardust.
Ah, Sir Mordred.
King... No, never mind.
What is it?
I don't like to get mixed up in office politics, but sources tell me Mordred has a sideline.
Sideline?
- He's moonlighting.
He has a guy on the rack, trying to force him to confess to poaching so that Mordred can rip off his land.
What?! That's a serious charge against a knight. I trust you have proof.
Oh, I do. Follow me.
- Wait!
A king does not follow a captive, however weird he may be.
Sorry, King, go ahead.
Downstairs and to your left, King.
Sir Mordred put him down here.
Poor guy's just skin and bones.
It appears he's wasted away to nothing.
- If indeed he ever was here.
Mordred, I'm told you're involved in a... what?
Land grab.
- Wresting property from free men.
A blatant lie, Your Majesty!
My honour had been impugned.
I demand satisfaction on the field!
- Again?!
He has that right, though I've lost some good knights that way.
Maybe I made a mistake.
Maybe he said Moorhead, not Mordred.
A joust to the death!
- You wouldn't change that to chess?
Chess? To the death?
- I demand satisfaction!
Oh, dear. Tut tut tut. So be it.
It shall be decided tomorrow.
I'll tell you one thing! No more nice guy me!
- I think you can safely say that.
(WHISPERS) Clarence, are you alone?
- Go away.
My hours are numbered as it is.
I've got a proposition for you.
This is yours to keep if you'll help me get outta here.
If you don't fight Sir Mordred, you'll be banished from England for ever.
That still beats a sharp stick in the chest.
What do you say?
There's a rope by the old chapel.
I'll be there at...
What's that?
- 9 o'clock.
OK.
What news upon my worthy opponent?
- We've searched the castle. He has fled.
Obviously he's cast his spell on the guards and fled, which gives little satisfaction to me!
If he has not made an appearance soon, we'll consider him vanquished.
And with it, I trust, his heinous charges against Sir Mordred, my liege.
Hello, what's this?
Oh, Father, he looks so handsome!
All in white with his little red, white and blue flag.
We must give him something to take into battle and his world beyond.
You shall not have your victory without bloodletting after all.
My pleasure! Let's get on with it!
Oh, Thomas, it would make me most proud if you'd carry something of mine into battle.
Please, wear this.
Oh, it's from Father, too.
- (BLEEPS) Thank you.
Is it over yet?
- Not yet.
But the maid Alisande is talking to your twin brother.
He's not my brother. Sandi?
- Yes.
He's a humanoid, a robot.
When we reset his staticizer,
I programmed him to joust for me.
Well, if thou say so.
Thomas...
.. I wouldn't dare speak like this
if I ever had to face you again. 
But since you're going to be killed, I see no harm in revealing my feelings for you.
Clarence, I think she likes me!
- We really have no time for this.
If one of Sir Mordred's servants found us here, I dare not contemplate his wrath.
OK.
All right, Hermes, that's enough.
Put her down and get on with the joust.
He's programmed to react, but this is sheer insubordination.
Hermes, put the girl down and go on with the joust. That's an order.
(BLEEPS) You feel soft.
I feel soft?
That's it? That's all you have to say?
- (BLEEPS) Later.
There is no later. I can turn you off as fast as she can turn you on!
Get what thou seeks and let us vacate these chambers.
You're right.
Giddy-up.
Should somebody should tell him his arm's missing?
I cannot intercede. I made the rule.
How's it going?
Ah, look at that.
Hermes, turn around and do it again.
You just have to keep going till you can't go any longer.
How's Hermes doing?
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
He seems to have lost his head.
- Hermes is cool.
Oh, you mean REALLY lost his head!
I'm sorry, Hermes, but this is to save England.
I have seen similar phenomena in chickens, My Lord.
This is England, sire.
Sir Mordred.
Can you not put an end to this?
It has long ceased to be sport.
As Your Majesty knows, tradition demands he must yield or die!
Well, at least it's out of its misery. Come.
The contest is over down there.
- How's Hermes?
Done for.
- Maybe I can put him together again.
All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't do that.
Look at this! This is it! Just wait till King
Arthur gets a load of this! C'mon, let's go!
Pity. I was becoming rather attached to it, whatever it was.
It will no longer be a source of torment.
I've despatched it from our midst for all time.
With your permission, I will keep these remains for my laboratory...
.. and gain an insight into its origins and feeding habits.
Yes, well, do as you please, Merlin, but tidy up thoroughly.
Merlin... Oh, I'm sorry.
Might I prevail upon you to change my father over there into his old self?
It's seems...
- Later, later, my child!
More important matters demand my attention.
You and your father can wait in my quarters.
Wait a minute!
Everybody, stay right where you are!
Merlin, keep your mitts off Hermes!
Sandi, I'm all right.
- You are?
This is too much!
You reproduce yourself like a lizard's toe!
You change colours like a chameleon!
- I have documentary proof that Mordred is acquiring territory, arms and men for a takeover.
How did you acquire such holdings?
I see you've been levying your own taxes.
To what ends, Sir Mordred? Well?
To take over Camelot and, with it, England.
He sees himself in your chair, King.
Seize that knight!
- Death to Arthur!
Stop him!
Gawain, there's something unholy about this.
Wouldn't it be better to let him rest in peace?
Perhaps a dandelion poultice would help.
It's not as bad as I thought.
I can bypass his synthesiser and keep his command analyser functioning.
Maybe you can do something about Father.
- I told you, I saw your father. I talked to him.
Are you certain? He's about 12 stone and five-foot-nine.
He may be a little taller than that now.
We must thank you for revealing Mordred's treachery. Is there no way we can repay you?
No. I'm glad to help out.
We must inspect the castle defences.
I'm worried about Mordred's attack.
I may be able to help out there.
Hmm.
Hang in there, Hermes, we'll have you up and about in no time.
OK.
- No hard feelings about the joust?
You are so brave, Hermes.
Oh, don't worry, he's resting comfortably.
Clarence, weren't you supposed to help hide the valuables?
So... er...
.. how would you like a personally conducted tour of Stardust?
Oh... I think not.
I've got some LPs you haven't heard.
Fleetwood Mac, Rolling Stones.
Thanks, anyway.
Hey... why the hot and cold bit?
Didn't you say before the joust that you felt... pangs?
Oh, Thomas, I made an awful fool of myself.
I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
I bared my heart to... to your brother here and it turns out that he's full of wiggly things and smoke.
Look, Sandi, I'm just as human as you are.
I've got a mother and a father.
He's an optometrist in Poughkeepsie.
I squeaked through high school, but I did get a masters at college and lettered in baseball.
I took Mona Shanks to the senior prom and struck out there.
I've got a good job. What more do you want?
I am just an average American boy!
Don't you understand that?
No!
Oh, come on, Father.
Maybe we can get to see Merlin now.
Keep a sharp eye.
Fear not, sire, we shall defend our castle, whatever the cost may be.
We shall fight on the beach heads, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the courtyards and in the halls, we shall never surrender!
I'll be darned!
- Well said, Winston!
They'll probably come from the north.
- They'll come from the south.
Mordred will make an assault on the gates with battering rams and superior forces.
They'll have to bridge the moat first.
I have the answer to that.
You do?
- Yes, sir.
See that hay cart down there?
- We can all see the hay cart.
What wizardry hast thou now?
- This is called a laser gun.
Hermes was supposed to use it on planets for collecting rock samples.
You pull the trigger there and don't point it at anything that you wanna keep.
A cart is a cart. Let's see how effective it is against the stone walls of Camelot.
Wait one second.
OK, OK.
- Now?
Well, what do you think?
- Well...
I have always had the highest regard for you, Tom.
I remain, sire, your most obedient servant.
Gawain, please, cease thy fawning prattle.
This is very dangerous. Be careful it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
Don't worry, King, I keep it handy at all times.
Oaf... it's going to be impossible for Mordred to take Camelot with that American and his magic candle.
Oaf kill!
No. Arthur would have an immediate investigation.
There's more than one way to skin a cat, though it could get pretty sticky!
Find that demented girl and tell her the magician will see her in the lower chambers.
And I will take care of the American.
You understand what you are to do, Oaf?
Now, you be nice to the magician when he sees you. He's there to help.
Merlin is expecting us.
The first visit is two gold coins payable at time of treatment.
The magician will see you now.
Well, my dear, what is the matter?
I'm all right, sire, it's Father...
Let me go! Let me go!
Get rid of that accursed goose!
Don't eat it!
There'll be feathers all over the place!
Let me go!
Where is she?
- I know not, sire.
I was told that she would meet you here.
She wanted to hear some of your... LPs.
Thanks.
Fiendishly clever, the American.
Who else would've thought to hide it there?
But he did not reckon with the clairvoyant powers of the invincible Merlin!
Will it make a big noise again?
- Hope not.
I had the cotton packed too tightly last time.
That's why it exploded.
He's trying to get thrust to propel the craft into the air. Can't you see that?
Very good, Hermes.
- ( BLEEPS) Where's Sandi?
Forget about her. I cooled my heels for three hours waiting for her. She and I are through.
You put her out of your mind, too.
- (BLEEPS) That's not easy.
OK, here goes.
Hey!
I'm terribly sorry.
Use that dagger when Mordred attacks.
- I think I can fix it.
Hey, what have you got there?
- It's a goose, as anyone can plainly see.
It's a gander. Where did you find him?
- It was on the moat.
Then it flew up to the parapet.
He'll make a splendid supper.
No, he won't. Keep him in protective custody.
And... not that I care, but... where was the girl?
There was no girl about, just him.
I did hear a woman scream from yon wood.
- I saw her with Oaf, going to Merlin's room.
That quack?
King, I think we're in trouble.
You haven't misplaced her there?
- The laser gun's gone.
Who'd take it?
- Merlin!
He lured me out by saying Sandi would meet me.
Merlin and Mordred?
- Absolutely! They're in cahoots!
Where?
- They're partners. Where'd he take her?
The seaside is awfully nice this time of year.
Please!
- This is serious!
Mordred's camp, no doubt.
- We've got to do something!
Don't look at me.
- I'll take care of it myself.
You're not going after the wench?
- The poor kid needs help!
I got it! King, I need your armour.
Oh, really!
You keep forgetting you're a prisoner. I don't lend prisoners my armour. The answer is no.
Then Mordred will reduce Camelot to dust.
Well, perhaps my workaday armour.
No, your Sunday go-to-meeting armour, the shiniest you've got!
Page, fetch it.
Sounds like some monstrous cat.
- Like none I've ever heard.
What has it coughed up now?
It's a fine cart, but where do the oxen go?
- King, this is a battery-powered lunar rover.
This is the soil sampler... I'll explain later.
Clarence, buff me up.
I can't understand this fuss over a girl. I can find you five girls more comely than that one.
But not as dingy. Lower the drawbridge!
- I saw when the bridge is to be lowered!
I told you that.
- I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.
Lower the bridge!
Hold the fort until I get back.
Alas, we won't see him again.
This passageway will give us access to the castle.
At dawn, you will engage the defenders until the drawbridge can be lowered.
Won't this passage be defended?
- It is my secret passage.
The King has no knowledge of it.
- We'll do our best.
Have your men present in force when the portcullis is raised.
Enough to crush all resistance!
- Sire!
Sire, something approaches the camp.
- Something?
It has two eyes that light up the night and makes strange breathing sounds.
Call out the guards!
It is the American. He has taken the bait.
It's King Arthur himself.
- No, it's Tom Trimble.
I've come for Alisande.
- You shouldn't have come! They'll kill you!
With your choice of weapons!
- Get behind me.
That will serve little purpose. We have seen the awesome power of the magic candle.
It will annihilate you both in a flash.
Now, Mordred, do the honours.
Any parting words, American?
- I'd like to speak to Sandi for a second.
Be brief.
- All right.
Sandi, I just want you to know that I groove on you.
My idea of heaven would be to split a pizza and a 6-pack while watching the Super Bowl, maybe smooch a little at the half.
Well, what do you think?
- Any news of Father?
Didn't you hear? I told you I loved you!
- I'm not going all through that again.
On the other hand, if it's between you and Oaf...
.. I'll take you.
- Great! Pull down my visor. Get behind me.
Yes.
(TOM) Fire at will, Mordred!
Mordred, cease before you destroy your entire force.
He has bewitched it!
Stop them!
Oaf, hold these two! I'll settle with them later!
On to the tunnel!
Six o'clock and all's well!
(WHISPERS) Come on!
Oaf... Oaf... look.
To eat. You... eat.
Sit on my lap!
- No!
Sit on my lap!
Put your arm around me. It's safer.
Are you taking me to your nest?
- No, Camelot.
I hope it's got the same landlord when we get there!
Capture the gatehouse!
Look, sire, it's Tom!
- Ahhhhhh!
Well done!
Once more! The gatehouse!
Ahhhhh!
Come on!
Stand to!
(MORDRED) Lower the drawbridge!
Raise the portcullis!
Thank you, Tom. Well done.
Thank you. Well done.
Never have so many owed so much to one man.
What a nice thought.
Hah!
Look out!
Stop those bowmen!
Oh, really! I've told you before, never turn your back on the enemy. It's dangerous.
It's no way to be found after the battle.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Clarence! Sandi! The winch!
Come, Clarence, hurry!
Free the winch!
No, no! No, no, no!
OK, lower me down to the ledge.
We're to lower him to the ledge.
Make them pay dearly for every inch!
Hermes...
.. activate all systems.
Fire rocket engines one, two and three.
This American's wings must be clipped if we are to save the day.
Do not fear the contrivance! It has no power!
(TOM) Engage left thruster. 
Activate thrusters as your sensors warn of approaching danger.
Whoa! Take me back up to the ledge!
- You're too heavy!
# Oh, say can you see... #
Hermes, close the hatch.
Not so fast!
Destroy the American! He is our nemesis!
Hermes, set both magnetic fields on pulse.
He must be destroyed! Get him!
- Go on!
Get him!
A purse for the man who finishes him!
Increase power of magnetic fields.
Clarence, it's getting heavier!
The King said this armour was solid gold.
It's not.
I think he's in trouble.
- What kind?
It's difficult to say, but don't look, Sandi.
Ahhhhhhh!
Hermes, cut the power!
Come on, Father.
King, take 'em downtown and book 'em.
- Thank you, Tom.
We owe you our kingdom.
Victory!
Hooray! Hooray!
Gee, I don't know what to say.
Such distinguished company.
King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad...
Sir Gawain.
- Sir Gawain.
I will retire this chair and if ever you return, your place at the Round Table will be here.
Boy, they're never gonna believe this at the Cape! Yes, they will!
Everybody, group up there for the photograph.
The what?
- I'll show you in a minute.
Bunch in. Sandi, you and your father get over here. Clarence, scrunch in next to the king.
Put your arm around him, King.
Hurry up! And everybody say cheese!
(ALL) Cheese?
Now, King, this is what I mean by a photograph.
That's me!
- Yes, the whole gang!
King, you take this. When Merlin gets out, it'll drive him bananas.
Bananas?
- Yep.
Er... Sandi, could I talk to you for a second?
Well...
.. I'm going now.
I wish I could take you with me.
There's so many things I'd like to show you.
My old MG, my ten-speed.
The Space Mound, the Grand Canyon.
That would be very nice.
But I just don't know if you'd survive the trip.
You could age 1,000 years before we re-entered.
I understand and thank you for getting Merlin to change my father back into his old self.
Sure.
Would... Would you give this to Hermes, please?
Sure.
Bye.
Clarence, I wanna thank you.
You helped change the course of history.
Did I?
- You certainly did.
Thank you, Hermes.
This is a token of our appreciation.
If it fails, will he stay with us?
- We have a place for him in the chapel.
But...
- Don't bother me. I've important work to do.
It's from his Uncle Sam.
- Really? How nice.
Minus 10 and counting.
- Let's see if we can get off the ground.
Ignition.
Blast off.
We have lift-off.
We did it!
From Sandi.
"Dear Hermes, I think you are sweet and I will remember you fondly,
"but there can never be anything serious between us.
"I have given the matter a lot of thought and I like Tom best,
"but it was not an easy decision. Alisande. "
Ready?
Is the clock winding the right way?
Year 680.
- Good man.
Robot.
We're travelling 290,000 miles a second and someone wants us to move over?
So that's where you've been lately.
Look at that. "Father" laid an egg!
How could we have been so wrong (?)
- Not bad for a goose over 100 years old.
You're right.
You're right! He... She hasn't changed a bit!
Look at her feathers, look at her eyes!
That means that Sandi wouldn't age either!
Hermes, right thruster - 180 degrees!
What on earth will you do with her?
- You mean, what will I do with her on earth?
Live happily ever after. Isn't that what you're supposed to do in a situation like this?
Daddy?
- Daddy, are you home?
- Maybe he isn't.
Of course he is. Daddy!
Find him?
- Does it look like I found him, Stanley?
- Well, I just thought...
Dad!
Daddy?
Don't worry about your father, Barbara.
I'm sure he's all right.
Oh, I don't know.
- Honey, I'm sure...
- Daddy!
Daddy, are you there?
- We shouldn't have left him alone.
- Honey, he wanted to come here.
- Don't get yourself all upset.
- Daddy?
Honey, what...?
- Stanley!
- OK, I'm coming.
- Daddy!
- I'm coming!
I told you over and over again he should not be left in this house alone.
It's too big for one man in his condition.
Honey, he wanted to be left alone.
You always take his side, don't you? Daddy!
Dad?
- Who the fuck are you?
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I don't know.
- You don't?
- How come you don't know?
- I just moved up.
- Let me see your dog tags.
- Let's see it.
Where are they?
- I can't find them.
- He's a Kraut!
- He don't look like one.
- I'm an American.
- Prove it!
- Prove it?
- Who plays third for the Tigers?
- The Tigers?
The Detroit Tigers.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
- What d'you ask him for?
- It came into my head.
- You guys go on without me.
- Where's your weapon, soldier?
- I don't have one.
- Everybody's got one!
I'm a chaplain.
I'm an assistant chaplain.
- What's your name?
- Pilgrim.
You know why this got three sides on it, Pilgrim?
- No.
- Makes a slit that don't close up.
Gee, that's great.
You stick a GI knife in a guy and it makes a slit, right?
- Right.
- A slit closes up, right?
- Right.
- This makes a three-sided slit.
It kills you, Pilgrim.
- What's that?
- Chaplain's assistant.
- No shit! What's your name?
- His name's Pilgrim.
You know how to pray?
Then start praying!
- Where the hell are we, Corp?
- Belgium, stupid.
Don't fuck around.
You tell Paul Lazzaro where we are!
- We're in the middle of Krauts!
- You got us here, get us out!
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily...
Just beyond those trees on the other side there's a farmhouse.
Listen, you guys go on without me.
I'll be all right, honest.
I'm gonna scout that farmhouse, you hear?
And if it's clear, I'll fire my carbine three times spaced. You got it?
Got it!
That son of a bitch ditches us,
I'll kill him.
- We could surrender.
- What?
We could surrender, couldn't we?
We'd just have to stay here and...
Listen to me!
Me and the corporal and the dago, we're Americans, we don't surrender!
- You got that?
- He's took off.
That corporal.
He'll get back home after the war, he'll be a big hero.
Dames will be climbing all over him.
Couple of years will go by and one day there's gonna be a knock on his door and there'll be this stranger.
"Paul Lazzaro sent me," the stranger will say and then he'll pull out a gun and shoot his pecker off.
Stranger will give him a couple of seconds to think about who Paul Lazzaro is and what life's gonna be like without a pecker, then he'll shoot him once in the guts and walk away.
Yes.
'Billy, you time-tripping again?'
Mm-hm.
I can always tell, you know, when you've been time-tripping.
You were back in the war, weren't you?
Time travel's a bitch for you, isn't it?
Particularly the war.
I can't help it.
Well, why don't we see if old Mother Montana can't keep you stuck right here for a while?
- How about a little kiss?
- A little kiss?
- Yeah, a little kiss.
- A little kiss.
- A what?
- A little kiss.
You fucking faggot!
- What's the matter?
- You fucking fairy!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
- What's the matter, faggot?
- I was thinking of a girl.
He said he wanted to kiss me.
- I was imagining things and I was...
- Just give me the knife.
Come on, will you?
Come on!
Billy, you're wonderful.
- Oh, I'm so glad I waited.
- I'm glad we waited too.
Otherwise, it wouldn't have seemed the same tonight.
No, it wouldn't.
It starts the whole marriage off on the right foot.
Yeah. Yeah.
I know when you were in the war you must have had... experiences.
- Well...
- No, don't tell me about them!
It was wartime.
And anyway, it's different for a man than for a woman.
I understand that.
I'm just so glad we waited.
So am I.
And you know what?
I'm gonna lose weight just for you, Billy.
See, before I needed a reason, and now... I have one!
Hey, Billy.
I think we've begun the life of a new hero.
- How can you tell?
- Because I'm a woman.
Huh!
And you know what, Billy?
What?
I never thought anybody would ever marry me.
I did.
Oh, Jesus, Pilgrim!
Stay off my feet, will ya?
- Oh, walk right, will ya?
- Gee, I'm sorry.
You step on his feet again, you son of a bitch, and I'll break your ass, you hear me?
Komme her. Schnell. Sofort.
Good. Hold it.
Look out here now.
- Can you get the sign in?
- The sign's in good.
OK, smile.
Look at the camera and smile.
- Looks good.
- Hold it right there.
Big smile now.
Big smile!
'Good. Hold that kiss.'
We got it!
All you dog faces from the 451st over here.
Fall in here.
It's your old colonel, boys.
It's Wild Bob.
451st.
You! You from the 451st?
Some of you boys must be from the 451st.
You, soldier, I know you, don't I?
What's your name, soldier?
- Pilgrim, sir.
- Pilgrim. Of course! I remember you.
Damn fine rifleman.
Fine rifleman, Pilgrim.
One of the best in the 451st.
First in peace, first in war, and first...
Get your hands off me!
An officer's place is with his men!
My men need me and I'm staying with 'em!
Don't worry, it's your old colonel, boys.
Wild Bob is with you.
No formalities.
At ease, at ease.
By God, Wild Bob's proud of you.
There are dead Germans all over the place, wishing to God they'd never...
I'm staying with my men.
All right, all right.
God bless you, boys.
Bless you, boys.
By God, boy, you're a good soldier.
You'll come through this all right.
And when you get to Cody, Wyoming, just ask for Wild Bob.
We'll have one hell of a reunion.
God bless you, boys!
Bless you, boys!
A fag frolic in Wyoming.
I'll be there, Pilgrim, waiting for you.
This ain't so bad.
I been in a lot worse spots than this.
Troy, winter of '37.
Cold? I'll tell you!
Or take the time
Watkins and me decked the yard bull at White River junction.
Had us in the pen for three weeks in our skivvies.
Would have had pneumonia if we hadn't jumped the place.
They took us up to Burlington to check us out.
Last I heard, Joe was somewheres on the Allagash.
You try that sometime, pal.
You try that sometime in February in 1934, then see if you think this is so bad.
There are plenty of worse places.
Plenty of worse places, believe me.
He was at the top of his class in optometry school when this happened.
I don't doubt it, Mrs Pilgrim.
The doctor says it's nervous exhaustion.
I'm sure that's all it is.
I think it's the war.
That certainly could have a lot to do with it.
But he had some awful experiences.
He was in Dresden when it was bombed.
His closest friend was killed there.
Dreadful, dreadful.
And, of course, his father passed on, you know, while Billy was in training.
But I knew God would send Billy home safe to me.
I prayed every night,
Mr Rosewater.
Even though we don't belong to a church of our choice.
We're all in God's hands, dear.
Billy! Billy, Mama's here.
You can come out now.
He's engaged to a very rich girl.
Her name's Valencia,
Valencia Merble.
- Her father's Lionel Merble.
- Oh, of course.
He owns the Ilium School of Optometry where Billy was going.
He's also building a brand-new home for them on the lake for a wedding present.
It's a surprise.
Billy. Billy, sweetheart.
The war is over.
You can come out now.
Pilgrim!
You killed me, Pilgrim.
You son of a bitch.
You call my mom and dad in Pittsburgh, see.
You tell them I died and that you killed me!
Weary.
This is Paul Lazzaro, Weary.
I'll get revenge for you.
- Lazzaro.
- Yeah.
Hey, did I ever tell you what happened to the dog?
It's hot.
Son of a bitch dog bit me so I got some steak.
And I got me the spring out of a clock and I cut that spring up into little pieces and I stuck it into the steak, way inside.
And I went to where they had that dog tied up and I said, "Hey, boy.
"I'm not mad. Let's be friends."
And I threw him the steak, and I waited for around ten minutes.
And he started crying and the blood spilled out of his mouth.
He tried to chew out his own insides, and I said,
"Hey, boy.
"That's me inside there with those knives."
Anybody ask you the sweetest thing in the world, it's revenge.
Weary's dead, Pilgrim.
The patient here has been suffering from trauma which we think can be successfully treated by electric shock.
- Hello, Billy.
- Hello.
We've prescribed a series of 12 and we're up to number seven.
The patient was a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was bombed.
He claims that well over 100,000 people were burned to death in the fire.
Worse than Hiroshima.
And since Billy was actually there, it's natural enough to assume that this has had a contributing effect on his present condition.
He's ready, Doctor.
You're going to sleep now, Billy.
Schnell!
- Name?
- Paul Lazzaro.
That's two Zs.
Parents?
I don't got no family.
I said two Zs.
To whom we send the number in case of death?
Send it to him.
This is your tag.
Don't forget it.
Jawohl.
Name?
Parents?
You want it now, Pilgrim, or would you like it in the morning?
What do you want?
Hey, hey! Why me?
Oh, you're on my list, pal.
A ufstehen...
Gear it down there, fella.
These Germans can be awfully mean.
Oh, yeah? Well, they don't know Paul Lazzaro.
Listen, we Americans have got to stick together.
- Who are you, Pop?
- I'm Edgar Derby.
Yeah? Well, I got something for you to stick, Derby.
All right, all right.
Hey, you fucking goon!
All right!
I'm taking 'em off!
Leave me alone, I'll take 'em off!
A ufstehen your ass!
I'm warning ya, pal.
All right, son. Over here.
Here we go, Billy boy.
I'll take you out.
- Time to sink or swim!
- That's the way to do it, Mr Pilgrim.
- Best thing in the world for him.
- Here we go, boy.
By God, Pilgrim.
You're really going to do it.
You bet your boots
I'm going to do it.
His mama's not gonna keep him all of his life.
My old man did the same to me.
I'll never forget it.
- Done me a world of good.
- Oh, you betcha! It's the only way.
Well, this is it, Billy boy.
It's sink or swim!
And don't...
Billy?
Billy?
Billy!
- Who are they?
- They're Russian prisoners.

Evening. Come along inside.
We've organized a little welcome for you in here.
We were lucky we had a couple of days' notice of your arrival.
That gave us an opportunity to prepare.
Hear you had a beastly time in the Ardennes.
Jerry put on quite a show there, I hear.
It can't last forever, can it?
Just take it easy, pal.
- Where'd you get all this?
- Red Cross. Clerical error.
They've been sending us
500 parcels a month instead of 50.
Three years now.
We've got rather a lot, actually.
Shouldn't you tell 'em?
I mean, shouldn't you give it back?
Oh, Yank, you haven't been in the fight for very long, have you?
Come along.
I keep forgetting wars have always been fought by children.
Where did you get this absurd garment?
- They gave it to me.
- Who?
The Germans.
They didn't give you a coat, they gave you an insult.
Hey, son. Over here.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Jerry tried to humiliate you.
Now you must wear that coat as if you were proud of it.
Teach him a lesson.
It's terribly important that you understand that.
It's been almost four years since I was taken prisoner.
True of most of us here.
We haven't seen a woman or a child in all of that time.
Think about that for a minute.
Do you want to know how we survived?
Well, I'll tell you.
The day that I was captured,
I made a promise to myself.
I vowed that each day I would brush my teeth, shave my beard, wash my hands before each meal and evacuate my bowels with as much regularity as circumstances would permit.
And do you know why?
Because the war consists of continual petty humiliations.
And I for one was going to treat myself with self-respect and survive.
Do you think you can do it?

You tell him what happens.
Nobody fucks around with Paul Lazzaro.
You tell him!
Boy's all twisted up inside.
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
What's he got against you?
He's got this crazy idea that I caused his friend's death.
- I didn't. I bumped into him...
- I'm sure you didn't.
I'll talk some turkey to that boy.

Here. Try some of this.
This will fix you up.

Thank you.

Uh-huh.
You don't have to stay.
What the heck.
I might as well.
I got some food when I was back there.
I don't mean to be impolite, but how come you're in the army?
I couldn't stay out, not with the Nazis and the Japanese threatening to conquer the world.
As a matter of fact, I got a boy your age seeing action in the South Pacific.
- Hey, that's really something.
- Yeah.
I used to tell my students there's a monster loose in the world.
One day I got tired of telling 'em and I said goodbye and I joined up.
- I thought you were a teacher.
- Oh, come on.
You have that confidence and a very good way with words.
I'll tell you one thing.
We don't mince phraseologies at Boston Trade and Industrial.
Oh, boy.
I wonder, if my father were still alive, if, uh...
I don't think he would have.
Don't you ever sell him short, son.
Mom would never have let him.
You couldn't blame her, could you?
But then I'm lucky, I guess.
Margaret's a very understanding woman.
We were childhood sweethearts.
Hey, that's nice.
You got a girl back home?
No one special.
Margaret's the only woman
I've ever known.
There's Margaret.
Aw, she looks awful nice.
She's just about everything a man could ask for.
Oh, oh. What's this?
That's my mom in our backyard.
Oh, you have a very nice-looking mother.
- Yeah, she is.
- Very nice.
- That's a nice house too.
- That's the back.
It's a nice yard.
Nice.
When did you enlist?
It wasn't quite like that, see?
I was drafted.
Oh?
It's not that I didn't wanna go,
I just wanted to finish school first.
- Where were you in school?
- The Ilium School of Optometry.
An optometrist?
That's a very good field.
Yes, it is, 'cause you're doing things for people and there'll always be a need for optometrists.
Boy, what you just said is a very good philosophical way of life.
- What?
- About filling a need and helping people.
Why, that's self-determination and free enterprise backing itself up all the way.
That's why we're in Europe stopping Hitler.
My name's Edgar Derby, son.
What's yours?
- Billy Pilgrim.
- Billy, it's nice to have you aboard.
- Thank you.
- You had enough of that?
Yes, I did. Thank you.
The English gave me these boots for ya.
Don't mind the silver paint.
They did that for a skit about Cinderella.
It was darn funny.
It was a lot of singing and dancing and crazy stuff.
Yeah, I admire the English, you know.
They have a great philosophical way of life.
Keep themselves going, you know, putting on shows, Gilbert and Sullivan.

This diamond has a story to it.
Billy actually found it in Germany during the war.
Billy, tell them about it.
Oh, go ahead, darling, tell them.
Billy's too modest so I'll tell you.
- When he was a prisoner in this...
- Good boy, Billy.
Thanks.
They gave him an awful coat to wear.
Congrats, Billy.
What was his name, hon?
- Who?
- The one that was killed in Dresden.
- Edgar Derby.
- Oh, that's right.
Poor old Edgar Derby.
Oh, that was really awful.
They shot him for, uh...
What was it, Billy?
Well, anyway, before that they found this diamond right in the pocket of Billy's coat.
Lord knows how it got there and why somebody didn't find it before.
It probably came from some poor Jew they'd taken it away from.
So many of them had their money in diamonds.
Jesus, Dad!

- There.
You shouldn't be reading that kind of junk, Robert.
Jesus!
Lads. Lads.
Hey, Billy!
Billy. Over here.
Can I have your attention?
Please, please, please.
You're being transferred to a camp in Dresden.
You're going to be leaving for there this afternoon.
Actually, I'm quite envious of you.
Dresden is a beautiful city.
Paid a visit there myself before the war.
Besides being quite lovely, it's quite safe.
It's an open city without war industries or troop concentrations.
It's by far the safest place to be until we get this all over with.
Now, then, you must elect a leader.
He's going to be in charge of all this group.
You'll all be under his direct orders and he will be your line of communication with the Germans.
Nominations are now open.
You need a leader.
I nominate Paul Lazzaro.
Lazzaro. Right.
Anyone else?
- Well, then...
- I nominate Edgar Derby.
Anyone else?
You'll be responsible, all of you, to this man you elect, and he'll be responsible to the Germans.
So, if you mess him up, he's the one they're gonna be after.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Pop, you want it so bad, you got it.
I un-nominate Lazzaro.
'I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone' when I introduce our Lions Club president for the coming year.
Our own Billy Pilgrim.
The floor's all yours. Good luck.
Oh, shut up, will ya?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Mr Walters, Fellow Lions.
I want you to know that I'll do my best to live up to the...
...confidence you showed by "chosing"... choos... by having chose me here today.
Uh, and I know that my first responsibility...
...is to see each and every one of you gets through this safely and are reunited with your loved ones.
I'd like to ask you...
I know we're all of different faiths, but we're all Americans...
Oh, God.
...to bow our heads together for a moment and pray.
Oh, go take a flying fuck, will you?
If that isn't the most obscene, vulgar... Oh!
'Is my bath ready, Silvio?'
'Yes, Mistress.'
'My robe, Silvio.'
Honestly!
To show this kind of junk at a family drive-in, it's disgraceful!
'Why do you avert your eyes from me, Silvio?'
Why you wanted to take the children to it is beyond me.
- 'Massalina can give you salvation...'
- Oh, Robert!
You shouldn't see that!
Mom!
'Do you find Massalina unattractive?'
- Oh, gross!
- Wow!
- That's it, that's enough!
- Jesus, Mom!
They show more than that in health class.
Billy, take us home.
I don't want to hear another word.
Shit!
I will not tolerate that kind of language in front of me, goddamn it!
I am not going to subject myself to that filth out there or allow my children to be subjected to it.
That is the end of that.
- Billy, I am talking to you!
- 'Come on.'
- 'Silvio. Silvio.'
- Billy!
Billy.
Billy! Come here.
See how you like this one.
"Dear Meg,
"We're on our way to Dresden to do some work for the Germans.
"It won't be war work because the Geneva Convention prohibits that,
"and besides, there isn't any war production in Dresden.
"Dresden is the town where our porcelain dancing figure came from.
"Remember the one that Johnny knocked off the table and broke?
"Dresden's never been bombed because it isn't a military target
"so we'll be safe there.
"Please write to Johnny and give him all my love
"and tell him I know we'll all be back together again soon.
"Tell him how proud I am of him."
- Where is he?
- Your boy's in the car, Mr Pilgrim.
He's the only one we actually caught.
They knocked over
14 gravestones, all told.
I just can't understand why he'd do such a thing.
Has he said anything about Catholics?
I mean, has he anything against them?
No. We've got a lot of Catholic friends.
What will the McNalleys think?
What are we going to say to them?
Mr Pilgrim, if I could see you up here for a moment.
My, God! Why did he do it?
Look, I don't want to take the boy down to the station.
I figured it might be embarrassing to you.
Maybe we could handle it in some other way.
Thank you very much, Officer.
If you get the damages from the church,
I'd be happy to pay for that.
I'll see what I can do about that, Mr Pilgrim.
And I'd like to show my appreciation by giving this to the policeman's fund.
You don't have to do that, Mr Pilgrim, but it's very generous of you.
I'll call you after we've been able to determine the extent of the damages.
What's the matter, Billy?
You must be the greatest father in the world.
I love my son, Billy.
Guess that's all it takes.
Hey, you guys. We're there.
It's beautiful.
- I never saw anything like it.
- It's lovely.
It's the Land of Oz.
Ich bin the American Kommandant.

Ich bin the American...
Guess you'd better go across.
OK, men.
Everybody on the other side.

- Go back in line.
I was told to take charge.
OK, fellas.
Move out. Move out.
Don't you be fooling around with any oo-la-las in Montreal, Billy.
How can I cheat with your old man around?
That won't be so hard.

- Daddy, shame on you!
Hey, come on, Billy.

Bye!
Bye.
I know there's gonna be meetings, a little business, but I really mostly wanna see you enjoy yourself.
By God, you deserve it.
You really do.
You want me to tell you a secret, huh?
Well, I wouldn't tell anybody this, of course, but... when Valencia brought you home and wanted to marry you, to tell you the honest-to-God truth,
I thought she'd brought home a first-class loser!
I'm not kidding.
I really thought that.
But you proved me wrong, Billy.
I'm the first to admit it.
You proved old Lionel wrong.
Dad?
- The plane's gonna crash.
- Oh, come on, Billy boy!
In 25 minutes the whole thing cracks up.
You can't get out of your seat!
- Stop the plane. It's gonna crash.
- No one's allowed in the cockpit, sir.
- I organized this. I'm responsible...
- Do you want to be removed?
- But you don't understand!
- We've got clearance for take-off.
Everything's going to be all right.
Buckle in and leave the driving to us.

A Cadillac! A white Cadillac!
It's what I've always wanted!
Come on, Robert!
I've always wanted a white Cadillac!
- Oh, Billy. Oh, sweetheart.
- And now you got it.
- Oh, it's a little tight.
- You can adjust the seat with this, see?
- Oh, no, no! That's too tight!
- Or backward.
- You can make it go up...
- Oh, no, it's squishing me!
- Or down.
- It's wonderful!
I'm gonna lose weight!
Oh, I'm really gonna lose weight, Billy.
I love you. I love you.
Get the stretcher! Quick!
- Was he alert in the ER?
- No, not very.
His right eye was dilating and his blood pressure was up.
He seemed pretty drowsy.
He's shaved and prepped, Doctor.
Let's get the pressure off.
- Are the instruments ready?
- Yes, Doctor.
Better get in as quickly as you can.
His right pupil no longer reacts to light.
Scalpel.
'Cautery.'
Electric burr.
Let me have some saline.
'Each day you will recite your number' so we'll know how many men are here.
There'll be no talking to Germans unless talked to.
When the war is over, we'll talk.
Let's make another burr hole right here.
Each day you will be given a working assignment for factory, cleaning or mail.
But there is not going to be any talking to Germans.
When you talk, you talk to your guards only.
Blood pressure is falling off.

That's wonderful.
Did you find Mother?
Well, it... it's crazy, Barbara.
I... I don't understand.
What's crazy, Stanley?
Where's Mama?
Come on, honey.
L-let's sit down.
Listen, I think we'll take care of your father till he's able to take care of himself.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Well, I looked all over for your mom and then I asked one of the nurses.
And they said that... that she died about three hours ago.
So I had to find out if it was the right one.
And it was. She was.
How?
I don't know, uh...
She had some kind of accident with the car and got carbon monoxide poisoning.
But she drives a Cadillac!
Honey, I don't know.
That's what they told me.
Oh, God.
I know. I know.
- Darling, how you feeling?
- Dirty sons of bitches.
- What's the matter?
- Bureaucratic bastards.
They have the audacity to put me in a room with a basket case.
- They just don't have a private room.
- Well, I don't know.
Goddamn it, Lily!
I'm gonna pepper your Radcliffe ass with buckshot if I ever catch you smoking again!
You better stay in condition to keep up with B.C. Rumfoord.
You guys go on without me.
I'll be all right.
Christ. All he does in his sleep is quit and surrender and apologize.
Shoot! I could carve a better man out of a banana.
Did you bring me those books from Widener?
The boys at the Harvard Crimson have a beautiful bit about you, honey.
They call you the Red Baron of military history and want you to get well soon.
Those little bastards!
The Truman statement about Hiroshima is in here, and those eight
Army Air Force documents.
Oh, yeah.
And the Irving book on Dresden.
I was there.
Honey, why did they keep Dresden a secret for so long?
Oh, hell. For fear a lot of bleeding hearts would say bombing it was a chickenshit thing to do.
My book's gonna lay it on the line, sweetheart.
Nobody's gonna weep and wail over Dresden after they read my book.
I was there.
- What's he saying?
- He said he was there.
Says he was where?
Dresden.
At Dresden, B.C.!
The hell with him.
Let him write his own book.
'Schlachthof fünf. '
'What the hell is he saying now?'
'Ich bin amerikanischer Soldat.'
Dresden.
- Schlachthof fünf.
- You wanna know something?
We didn't start the last war, the Nazis did.
And 135,000 people dying in Dresden does not seem so very much when put against over five million Allies who had to die!
And you just might remember that when we were bombing Dresden
'the Germans were sending
V-1 and V-2 rockets into London,
'killing men, women and children.'
- 'Don't get so uptight.'
- 'Jesus!
'It gives me a pain, weeping over Dresden
'and not giving a damn about our own losses!
'Hey, what about Coventry?
What about Rotterdam?'
What about the extermination camps the Germans ran, gassing millions?
I want your attention.
Attention, please.
You are having a visitor.
Howard Campbell Jr.
I have just come from the Russian Front so I'll make it short.
I don't wanna take up your time.
I know how hungry you are.
- Food's not much though, is it?
- Food's almost as neat as your outfit!
Men, I have a proposition for you.
How would you like to come back to America after this war as heroes?
Great, as long as I could wear that fag outfit!
Since you're so interested in my outfit,
I'll tell you what it's about.
Blue is for the American sky.
White is for the race that pioneered that continent, cleared the forests, drained the swamps, built the roads and the bridges.
And the red is for the blood of fine American boys that's been shed in defense of your freedom.
I don't see you shedding any blood, Campbell.
You all know that Communism is out to enslave the world.
And who's out there trying to stop them?
The Germans!
They're not your enemies, they're your allies!
Communism is the enemy of all of us!
I want volunteers for the Free American Corps, men who are willing to stand up to these commies.
Sit down, Lazzaro!
- I didn't vote for you, Derby.
- Good. Who's next?
If we don't stop them now...
Everybody moves to the air shelter.
There'll be no bombs.
Churchill's nephew lives in Dresden.
Don't worry, soldier.
Well, men, do I have only one volunteer?
Listen, pal,
I only stood up back there to tell you that one day your doorbell's gonna ring, see, and there's gonna be this guy in a trench coat...
We'll eat German craw for so long because we have to, but we'd rather die than eat your dung, which is sick and lousy and foul!
History will prove you an ass.
Oh, shit.
No bombs, eh, Campbell?
You can't trust the Jews.
Daddy, you should really stay with us.
And you shouldn't talk about Mama or the accident or even the war.
- I just wanna go home.
- But we want you with us!
- I'll be fine.
- Just for one night?
- No.
- Oh, Daddy. Honestly!
Daddy, you should consider yourself lucky.
Practically every optometrist in Ilium was wiped out.
Stanley's been working night and day for you.
Stinking old dog.
Hello, Spot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Daddy, honestly!
Won't you please change your mind and come stay with us?
You'll be in this empty house with that old dog.
- I'll be all right.
- But, Daddy, be a little realistic.
You just turned middle-aged.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Good night, dear.
You pigs!
You damned pigs!
Mama!
Mama!
- Dad?
- Papa!
Dad?
Dad?
Robert?
Hiya, Dad. Hi, Spot.
How did you get here?
Well, they...
They gave me leave to visit Mom.
- But you know that...
- Sure, Dad. I know.
That's why I'm here.
And to see you.
How are you, Dad?
I'm fine.
God, Dad, to think that you lived.
It's a miracle.
Like one time when a chopper got hit by Charlie just outside our camp.
It came down like a stone.
But the door gunner walked away.
Dad?
Dad, I did the right thing, joining up.
I'm sure you did, son.
Everybody knows it's a lousy war but sooner or later it's gonna be us or the Communists.
We've gotta stand up to them somewhere.
Dad?
Dad?
I know you and Mom worried about me a lot.
I guess I haven't been the best of sons.
- You've been just fine, Robert.
- No, I...
I know I was pretty wild and I wanna make up for it.
Remember that stuff in the cemetery? Jeez!
I'm so ashamed of that now.
Really, I am.
But I've changed a lot, Dad.
I just hope I can make you real proud of me from now on.
You already have, Robert.
Dad, will you come to Mom's grave with me?
I'm not ready yet.
I know how you feel, Dad.
I'm just not ready.
OK, Dad.
What's happened?
Where am I?
'Welcome to the planet Tralfamadore, Mr Pilgrim.'
Tralfam...
- Tralfama...
- 'Tralfamadore.'
Oh.
- How did I get here?
- 'There is no how, Mr Pilgrim.
'There is no why.
The moment simply is.'
I don't understand.
- Where are you?
- 'Oh, you can't see us, Mr Pilgrim.
'We live in the fourth dimension.
'But we can see you,
'and there are many important
Tralfamadorians here to welcome you.'
Oh. Well, uh...
How do you do?
'We hope that you'll find your accommodations here suitable.'
I have to stay here?
'I'm afraid so.'
You mean, I can't leave of my own free will?
'Mr Pilgrim,
'we have visited
31 inhabited planets in the universe.
'We have studied reports on a hundred more.
'And only on Earth is there any talk of free will.'
Well, what'll I do?
You will aid in the removal of the bodies.
Those that are identifiable will be tagged.
Their personal effects will be tagged and given to an officer.
There will be a classification according to the degree that the victim can be identified.
Any looting or stealing will be dealt with by a firing squad.
Follow me.
'It looked like the end of the world.'
'What looked like the end of the world, Mr Pilgrim?'
'Dresden, after the bombing.'
'Don't be so egocentric, Mr Pilgrim.
'We know how the world ends, and it has nothing to do with Earth,
'except that it gets wiped out too.'
'Really? How does it end?'
'While we're experimenting with new fuels,
'a Tralfamadorian test pilot panics, presses the wrong button
'and the whole universe disappears.'
'But you have to stop him!
'If you know this, can't you keep the pilot from pressing...?
'He has always pressed it
'and he always will.
'We always let him and we always will let him.
'The moment is structured that way.'
'Mr Pilgrim, a pleasant way to spend eternity
'is to ignore the bad times and concentrate on the good.'
It's... It's all right!
It's all right!
Will you be quiet, please?
Will you please be quiet?
Can't you see you're frightening her?
Who are you?
Who are you?
- My name's Pilgrim.
- What's this scene?
Where are we?
- We're on a distant planet.
- 'Are you mating now?'
What?
'Have you mated?'
Who are you?
'I'm a Tralfamadorian,
Miss Wildhack.'
A what?
'You're on the planet Tralfamadore,
Miss Wildhack,
'423 billion miles from Earth.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
- You're OK?
- Yes, thank you.
When were you born?
What month?
- What month?
- What month?
July.
July. What day?
The fourth.
The fourth of July.
You're practical with a belief in others based on your own integrity and an almost compulsive honesty.
You're a moon child!
Oh, you're a moon child.
- I'm a what?
- A moon child.
That's your sign.
Were you born in the morning or the afternoon?
It doesn't matter.
I don't have my charts.
Miss Wildhack?
Would you like something to wear?
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.
I was, uh...
I was down in Palm Springs at a home of a producer friend of mine, sunning myself by the pool.
That's why I'm like this.
I don't want halter marks.
Naturally.
And all of a sudden, it was like a... a ray.
- This is all I can offer.
- Thank you.
- And...
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
That's all there is.
And the next thing, I was...
I was here.
What's it like up here?
Well, I don't know because we can't leave the dome.
'The atmosphere of Tralfamadore is cyanide.
'It would be fatal to you if you left the dome.'
- This is it?
- I'm afraid so.
- How long will they keep us here?
- I don't know.
'You are here, you have always been here,
'and you will always be here.'
Is he trying to blow my mind?
No, no, no.
It all makes sense in a way.
- You see, in Tralfamadore...
- 'Would you please mate now?'
Look, we're not going to put on a show for you. That's one thing.
Another is, I demand you get
Miss Wildhack some clothing.
'If she's cold, we can always regulate the temperature.'
Now, you get down to Earth and get Miss Wildhack a complete wardrobe, and one that fits!
- What's your size?
- I take a ten.
But then I have to take it in here and let it out a little here so they'll have to bring a needle and thread.
Did you hear that? And remember,
Miss Wildhack is used to the best.
Thanks, uh...
Billy.
Billy.
Now we would like the night canopy.
'Why do you wish the night canopy?'
Because we want it!
- 'Will you mate?'
- We hardly know each other!
Do you mind if we take time to get better acquainted?
'You are acting very unnaturally.'
We would like the night canopy.
'Oh, very well.'
Would you like to sit on the couch?
Where is it?
Here.
Just take my hand.
- Ooh!
- Ooh. Uh, sorry.
Um, that's all right.
Careful.
Get away, Spot.
He's not bothering me. I like dogs.
Come here, Spot.
Come on.
- It's pretty comfortable.
- It's fine.
They got everything from Sears and Roebuck.
I appreciate what you said to them about me.
- Thank you, Miss Wildhack.
- Montana.
Montana.
I don't meet many gentlemen in the entertainment business.
- I'm an optometrist.
- Oh.
Would you like to kiss me?
Yes.
You kiss nicely.
Thank you.
Oh! Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no!
'Mr Pilgrim?
'Miss Wildhack?
'Are you mating now?'
Billy!
Billy, look at this!
Look at this! Perfect.
There's not a chip on it.
It's exactly like the one we had at home.
- The one your son Johnny broke?
- Yeah!
- How'd you know about that?
- The letter you wrote home.
Of course.
It's a miracle, isn't it?
This little dancer survived all this destruction.
Wait till I bring it home.
Can you imagine how Meg's eyes will light up?
Get back to work!
You!
What have you got there?
Oh, uh...
Look at this.
I found this down there.
There's not a chip on it. Pretty, isn't it?
We had one exactly like it.
Used to sit on the living...
Hey, what's the matter?
Feuer!
Stop!
Stop!
Billy.
Billy?
Billy?
Where were you, honey?
Billy, do you like this?
- It's nice.
- It's, uh, not too tight?
A little, maybe.
I'm so big here.
I like it.
That's 'cause you're a man.
I'm gonna have to let it out.
- I really think it looks just...
- Give me something to do.
Oh. You like it too, Spot, huh?
He always growled at my wife.
Do you miss her?
She died.
Somebody smacked into the rear of her car and the exhaust fell off.
She died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Wow. Like what they have out there?
No, that's cyanide.
That's worse.
Oh, wow.
What did you love most about her?
Her pancakes.
If we had a real stove, Billy,
I'd make you an out-of-sight macrobiotic soufflé.
I'd like that.
And then... we could think about having your baby.
Could we have the night canopy, please?
'Oh, Daddy! There is no such planet as Trilaflamaduke!'
Dad, I think what Barbara and I would really like to know...
Would you be willing to see a psychiatrist?
Listen, I have a friend who's not only a doctor but he's interested in outer space.
Why don't the three of us have lunch together today?
I'm not going to commit myself to an institution.
- Dad, I wasn't...
- If it weren't for Tralfamadore,
I might have needed an institution.
I don't need a doctor, Stanley.
On Tralfamadore you learn that the world is just a collection of moments, all strung together in beautiful, random order.
And if we're going to survive, it's up to us to concentrate on the good moments and ignore the bad.
- Besides, I'm in love up there.
- You know, Dad,
I'd really like to have lunch with you today.
I'll be very busy.
Montana's pregnant.
What's her name?
Montana Wildhack.
That's the Hollywood starlet who disappeared, isn't it?
Oh, my God.
Dad!
Hey, wait a minute, Dad.
Dad, listen.
If you go back and forth in time, do you go into the future too?
Mm-hm. Frequently.
Well, I mean, how far do you go?
Do you actually go...?
All the way to my death.
I've seen it many times.
I died in Philadelphia where I was giving a speech on the subject of Tralfamadore.
You see, in Tralfamadore, where I presently dwell, life has no beginning, no middle and no end.
For example, many years ago a man promised to have me killed.
He's an old man now, living not far from here.
He's read all of the publicity associated with my appearance.
He's insane, and tonight he'll keep his promise.
If you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood what I have said.
You see, it's time for you to go home to your wives and children.
It's time for me to be dead for a little while and then live again.
I give you the Tralfamadorian greeting.
Hello.
Farewell.
Hello.
Farewell.
Eternally connected.
Eternally embracing.
Hello.
Farewell.
Nobody fucks around with Paul Lazzaro!
Do you hear me, Pilgrim?
Pilgrim?
Pilgrim?
Hey, Pilgrim!
You hear me?
Pilgrim, get your ass over here and give me a hand!
- What are you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna make a fortune!
Are you kidding?
Haven't you got enough stuff?
What if we get caught?
We ain't gonna get caught.
The Krauts have all left.
If we don't steal it, the Russians will.
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Hey, wait!
Wait! Wait!
I surrender! I surrender!
I surrender!
I surrender!
I don't know. I don't know.
'Billy?
'Billy?
'We just had a baby!'
Billy, we've just had a baby boy!
Look at him!
Isn't he beautiful?
- Ah, yes.
- Isn't he incredibly beautiful?
He's perfect, every bit of him.
- What shall we call him?
- Billy, of course.
Anyway, even if he doesn't look too much like you, he's got your name.
Hello.
Are you hungry?
I think he's hungry now.
Mm-hm.
You hungry? Huh?
Here, here. There it is.
Take it, take it, take it. Ouch!
- (MAN) Good evening.
- I'm Professor Ivarsson.
Yes, Sir Anthony has been expecting you.
It's in your hands, Milo.
- Stand fast. They'll come to terms.
- Very well.
If problems come up, consult with the board.
They know my thinking.
Ah, Professor Ivarsson.
I cannot tell you how grateful I am you've joined me.
I haven't agreed to anything.
Someone woke me up at 6.00 yesterday morning saying he was the
British ambassador.
It was the British ambassador.
He'd arranged my passage on a mail-boat to England, and a large man packed my bags and drove me to the dock.
- Your train leaves in ten minutes.
- Good. Come along, Ivarsson.
But the... Sir Anthony.
Expedition to the Arctic?
I'm hardly a professional explorer.
No, let me finish.
- I've had you looked into.
- Oh.
You're an American from the University of Minnesota, currently a guest lecturer at the University of Christiania.
Your specialty is the archaeology of the North.
In the past, you've led several successful expeditions.
You've done interesting work in Greenland.
Oh, no. You're the right man for the job, all right.
For what job? What's so urgent about it? What is it you hope to find?
My... son.
You see, my wife died when Donald was a child.
I began to groom him to take my place in the business.
I pushed him too hard, I think.
Anyway, we had words.
And suddenly,
Donald dropped everything and went off on a whaling ship as an ordinary seaman.
Three months later, I got word that he'd left the ship in Bathenland.
Why?
I had no idea until I received this from a trading post at Fort Conger on Ellesmere Island.
Donald had left it with the factor for safe keeping when he had gone off on some sort of expedition.
When he didn't come back, the factor sent it on to me.
(IVARSSON) It's an old page from a Hudson's Bay Company journal.
Look at the entry for January 15, 1856.
"To this post, this day came
John Merchison with his Eskimos,
"who hunt the white bear far beyond the land's end.
"He told of seeing a lone cloud, as if lying on the ice,
"and hidden beneath it, an island.
"This island, he sought to examine, but his Eskimos refused him,
"saying it's guarded by evil spirits.
"For it's the place where the whales go to die."
- We're coming into Dover now.
- Thank you.
Sir Anthony, the graveyard of whales is just a fantasy, a whaler's El Dorado, where he thinks he's going to find a fortune in whalebone and ambergris.
Fact is, it simply doesn't exist.
It's a legend, nothing more.
Legend or not, the graveyard is what my son went after.
It's my son I'm looking for.
- (MAN) Quarters?
- Take our luggage to the admiral DPO.
Sir Anthony, I'm afraid this has to be the end of the line for me.
I'd help if I could. I know how much this means to you.
But you're trying the impossible.
To try to find one man with nothing more than a page from a journal...
There is something more.
Donald also left this with the factor.
I was hoping you might know what it was.
Hm. It's a carved bone. It's Eskimo work. It's quite common in the Arctic.
- This one's a map.
- (ANTHONY) Map?
If I had a chart,
I could show you how this works.
My yacht is at the pier.
You can have all the charts you need.
(IVARSSON) This pattern will correspond to part of the shoreline here on the chart.
Look.
See how this matches.
It's not exactly to scale, of course.
(ANTHONY) Then this red mark could be what we're looking for.
If there were such an island.
- Why shouldn't there be?
- There's no land here.
It's just a gigantic frozen sea.
All explorers agree.
Peerey, Nance and all of them.
And what is Ivarsson's opinion?
Of course, there's a lot they haven't covered.
But if there were such an island, if the graveyard of whales really did exist...
The world will never know, will it?
Unless you discover it, or unless someone else beats you to it.
Sir Anthony, you're a devious man.
Yes, I am, aren't I?
I've got your contract here.
Your leave from the university.
Power of attorney. My solicitors will handle your affairs in your absence.
- We're under way.
- And have been for some time.
We'll be in France in the morning.
Why France? That's hardly the most direct route to Fort Conger.
On the contrary.
I think you'll find that it is.
Can't you slow him down?
You'd think we were leaving tomorrow morning.
We are.
What?
I said, we are.
First thing in the morning.
Impossible. It's winter.
No ship can get through the ice before spring.
- I've made other arrangements.
- What arrangements?
If I told you, you'd think I was mad.
Sir Anthony, you are mad.
And now you're gonna meet another mad one. Capt. Brieux!
Ah, Monsieur Ross!
What a pleasure!
He was building this for Americans, but he ran through all their money.
I heard of it and took it over.
- Ah, Capt. Brieux.
- Good evening, Sir Anthony.
- Professor Ivarsson.
- I'm honoured.
- Do you mind if I take a closer look?
- No, please.
I'm proud we'll have you for the ceremony tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
- What ceremony?
- Why, the first flight of my creation.
Tomorrow, the whole world will know of me on my Hyperion.
France will rule the air!
Whatever you planned, cancel it.
Tomorrow, we leave for the Arctic.
The Arctic?
The Arctic?
Sir Anthony, that's ridiculous!
It can't be done.
That's impossible.
We would need food, supplies, fuel for the motors.
The fuel, I'll leave to you, Captain.
All other necessities have been amply provided by my staff.
I think it is best that we have an understanding.
We have an understanding.
I bought and paid for your airship.
It's mine.
I intend to use it to find my son, who is lost in the Arctic.
But I cannot do it without your help.
I can offer you nothing except hardship and danger, except your place in history.
- History?
- Think of it, Captain.
You have an opportunity which comes but once in a generation.
The world will know you not only as the first man to fly over the Arctic, but the first man, perhaps, to brave the North Pole itself.
Today, we make history.
There should be flags, music, a speech from the president.
But what do we have?
Two children and a herd of goats.
When you bring her back to France, the celebration's gonna break all records.
- We are ready to depart.
- Very good, carry on.
Silence!
There will be no speaking.
Well, we are on our way.
A glorious day, Monsieur.
We rise with the sun.
Congratulations, Captain.
This will be a morning to remember.
Something in the food hamper just bit me.
That is not the food hamper, that is the small boudoir of Josephine.
It's some kind of a dog.
Of course, the best kind: French.
I am not interested in its nationality.
- Who brought it aboard?
- No one brought her aboard.
She lives here. This is her home since the airship was begun.
(ANTHONY) I'm not running some kind of flying kennel.
Get rid of it.
Very well, if you wish, Monsieur.
Of course, it will take time.
The sun has warmed the gas.
We must wait until night to return to the hangar.
- Then bring back the ground crew.
- Wait until night?
That will mean 12 hours.
I can't lose the time.
You're absolutely right, Sir Anthony.
Congratulations, Josephine.
We've signed on our ship's mascot.
Very well, but I don't like small dogs, and I never did.
Britain may rule the waves,
Sir Anthony, but the French airship rules the sky.
Already, we are speeding in triumph across the shores of your homeland.
It's raining as usual, I see.
- How far have we come?
- About 150 miles.
Hundred and fifty? In six hours?
Is that what you call
"speeding in triumph"?
We'll travel faster, but now my motors are at half-speed.
What on earth for?
Damn you!
- They must run themselves in.
- Poppycock!
I want full speed!
There are the controls.
If you want full speed, it is your responsibility, not mine.
What do you say now, Sir Anthony?
I say, I want full speed.
And I mean to have it.
You have your wish, Monsieur.
It's on your head.
- What's happening?
- Somebody route the propeller.
I followed your orders, Monsieur, and you see the result.
Now we must go back to France for repairs.
We will not.
We will proceed on one propeller.
The Arctic winds!
That would be insanity!
Without full power, my airship could not survive.
- I refuse to go forward.
- And I refuse to go back.
Well, gentlemen, we have to go somewhere.
Captain, you carry a spare propeller, don't you?
- That is right.
- Well, why don't we put it on now.
- In midair?
- Mm-hm.
- Impossible!
- Nothing's impossible.
Splendid idea, Ivarsson.
Come along. Give me a hand.
Sir Anthony!
May I remind you that I am in command here!
Only an idiot would attempt such a thing.
I will do it myself.
Do be careful and don't take any unnecessary risks.
Take good care.
The wind's coming up.
Let's haul him up.
Well done, Captain.
My congratulations.
Thank you, Sir Anthony.
I am deeply honoured.
What's he up to now?
Vive le France!
Top fellow, Brieux.
- The man's incredible.
- Brave, but mad as a hatter.
Musk ox.
Over there.
What are they doing?
They're forming a defensive ring.
They think we are attacking.
Captain, is it really necessary to fly so low?
It's easier to control the airship at this altitude.
No need to be alarmed, Sir Anthony.
Look, I'm in full command.
You made your point, Captain.
There's no need to overdo it.

Now, what I don't understand is, why
Donald took only one Eskimo with him.
Only one could be persuaded to go.
They all knew what he was looking for.
The mythical island, where the whales go to die.
One man's myth is another man's gospel, Mr Ivarsson.
Anyway, the Eskimos believe the island exists.
They're frightened to death of it.
Say it's guarded by evil spirits.
What about the Eskimo who went with him?
Oomiak's his name.
They call him "The Fearless One".
Though he was far from fearless when he came back.
- He came back.
- (MAN) Aye.
That's him out there.
Showing the captain how to fly his airship.
Fetch the fellow. Call him in.
I'm afraid you won't get anything out of him.
Call him in at once. Don't argue.
Very well, Sir.
Any man that goes off with my son and comes back alone...
- I'll see that he talks, all right.
- You'd better let me handle him.
You've never dealt with Eskimos.
They have a diplomacy all their own.
Blasted.
Why doesn't anyone think I have tact?
Come along, Oomiak.
Ah, so there you are.
What I want is an exact account of everything that happened...
Sir Anthony, this is the great Oomiak.
Who knows Oomiak?
Your fame has travelled far.
What fame?
Not even my dogs know me.
You were my son's guide.
What happened to him?
Who?
This is the father of Donald Ross.
We wanna know about your trip...
Tell us what happened when you left here to find the island.
- Island?
- Don't try to play that game with me.
Oomiak, I think you've seen this before.
This is where the whales go to die.
It's the island Donald was looking for.
Well, speak up, man.
My mind forgets.
Is The Fearless One afraid to help us?
We travelled many days.
Evil spirits watch us when we find island.
They make big blizzard.
Pshh.
Then they attack us.
I fight like bear. Ah!
Fight like bear, but evil spirits too strong!
So you ran away and left my son?
No, we both run, blind in snow.
When blizzard stop,
I search for many hours.
No Donald.
I tell truth.
You, Donald's father.
I, Donald's friend.
- His whole story is a pack of lies.
- Maybe.
But he's the only chance we have.
He could show us where he lost him and start searching there.
I don't suppose there's any chance he'd go.
No, Sir, none at all.
Nothing on earth would make him go back.
Nothing on earth.
Why don't you let one of them on.
He can tell the others about it.
- No. You let one aboard...
- What about this fellow?
He's been a great help. Would you like to see the inside of the airship?
Me?
- Yes, I like.
- (ANTHONY) Good man.
Give him a hand, Captain.
Why don't you show him around.
- Perhaps we can win him over.
- Well, we can try.
Captain, a word with you.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Captain?
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
No, no, no, Monsieur.
Quite impossible.
There is no room, and we are overloaded now.
We could leave the mechanic.
Pick him up on the way back.
You ask me to fly without the mechanic?
But you have me.
Just tell me what to do.
I could, but you wouldn't do it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like we're ready to leave.
I better take you down.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Let go the lines there.
Wait, Oomiak's still onboard.
Hang it all, he's the only one who knows where Donald went to.
We could bring him back after he's helped us to find him.
Sir Anthony, since
I no longer have a mechanic, may I suggest that you first make fast the door, then go aloft and take in the landing lines.
Aye, aye, Captain.
We're here.
We can only guess how far the island is.
This Eskimo map is a little vague.
(ANTHONY) It's a lot to gamble on a piece of bone.
He's not much help to us either.
Did you expect him to be?
- (IVARSSON) Sir Anthony.
- Yes?
(IVARSSON) Come up, please.
There's been a report.
- (ANTHONY) What is it?
- Look over there.
- Whales.
- White whales.
Beluga. Indigenous to the Arctic.
Now look over there.
I say, that one's quite different.
The California grey. It's supposed to be found only in the Pacific.
A narwhal, the unicorn of the sea.
That's a rare sight, Sir Anthony.
By Jove, there are whales everywhere.
All kinds of whales.
And all moving in the same direction.
Exactly.
So there is a place where whales go to die.
Captain, that big lead of open water.
Follow it.
If we are on the right track, we'd have seen something.
Look. You remember the journal?
"A lone cloud, as if lying on the ice."
Oomiak.
Is that where the island is?
Wrong way. Wrong way.
Island not that way.
Island back this way.
- He told us what we wanted to know.
- Yes.
Steady as you go, Captain.
Look.
And hidden beneath the cloud, an island.
Captain. What happened?
Captain.
Captain, why are we stopping?
In such a cloud, it's not safe to proceed.
Not safe? What do you mean?
I could not see to navigate, and there will be strong winds.
My airship could be dashed against hidden cliffs and torn apart.
- We can't turn back now.
- We don't have to.
- We can go in on foot.
- Oh.
Capital idea!
Take the ship down to the ice.
- I'll get everything ready.
- No, no. You cannot leave the ship!
Professor, you know the dangers that lie below.
Even if you survive the cold, there are still the cliffs.
- You could not climb the cliffs.
- We must try, Captain.
I know. It's a gamble, Captain.
But with my son's life at stake,
I have no choice.
No, Sir Anthony, it is I who have no choice.
I'm not a man of stone.
There are times when the heart must rule the head.
We will attack the cloud.
- Maybe we can go above them.
- Impossible.
- Our load is too heavy.
- We'll assume lightweight.
Hurry up! We are losing height.
- You all right?
- Yes, quite.
I can't help thinking of the captain.
Poor fellow.
- How long must we keep this up?
- We can't survive in the open.
We've gotta keep moving until we find shelter.
There should be caves in those mountains.
Oomiak, is this anything like the place that you and Donald came to?
I tell you, Donald's father, we see nothing in blizzard.
Then spirits come and...
And you fought like a bear.
Yes, you mentioned that.
- Somebody watches.
- Where?
I don't see.
I feel.
Tommyrot.
Something moved.
- Did you see anything?
- I don't think so.
Neither did I.
I think we should head in that direction.
Oh, very well.
If you don't know where you're going, one way's as good as another.
It's incredible.
- I don't believe it.
- (ANTHONY) Green and fertile.
In all this ice and snow.
Look. There's the explanation.
The island must be volcanic.
Heat rising through fissures in the ground.
It's probably thermal springs.
Exactly like parts of Iceland.
There are buildings down there.
- (IVARSSON) Looks like a settlement.
- People. There are people there.
That means that Donald could be there.
The spirit! The spirit!
Wait a minute.
No, wait. We're friends.
Do you understand their language?
It's Norse.
The Old Norse of the sagas.
Their weapons, their clothes, their appearance.
- They're Vikings.
- Vikings?
They think we're invaders, come to take over their land.
- The three of us?
- No.
They think we're the first and thousands more will follow.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Talk to them.
Explain why we're here.
I'll try, but I've never spoken
Old Norse, only read it.
Donald?
That's it. Donald Ross.
Where is he?
Tell them I'm his father.
What is it? What's going on?
He understood me.
But he's going to sound an alarm to stir up the countryside.
We're to be kept under close guard.
Well, that's not good.
If they think we're invaders, then Donald could have been a prisoner all these months.
Make them tell us where he is.
Oomiak, no!
Idiot.
He might have got us all killed.
But he does fight like a bear.
He says you saved his life.
Well, I'm glad he appreciates it.
But tell him I don't want anything to happen to Oomiak.
Thank you.
He says your son is here and well.
He's living with the family of the man who found him after the great blizzard.
I knew it. I knew he was safe.
- (ANTHONY) What's happening?
- We're stopping to eat.
We just had a talk with our friend and found out why they're so panicky about invaders.
Oh? Why?
These people have been here for centuries.
They're descendants of some early Viking expedition.
We've actually discovered a lost colony.
That's quite remarkable.
They've been so isolated up here they believe that the rest of the world is a frozen wilderness of ice and snow.
How very odd.
- None of them ever left the island.
- They have no reason to.
They call this island Astragard and believe it to be the garden of the gods.
Perfect and unique in a desolate world and set aside for them alone. Forever.
- Why do they feel invaded?
- Because they have a prophecy.
There'll be a day when the barbarians will try to conquer their paradise.
Mm.
So that explains it.
They think that we're the savages who've come to destroy them.
Could be a bit tricky.
As soon as I get to their headman,
I'll straighten things out.
(IVARSSON) Reindeer.
Probably serve them as cattle.
That's the house where Donald's living.
Donald is there? Well, come on!
My son.
I haven't seen him for two years.
Tell them, Ivarsson.
I'll go with them, but not until I've seen my son.
Thank you, my boy.
Very decent of you.
They don't look happy to see us.
That hunter stirred them up.
I don't see Donald amongst them.
Thank you, Sir.
Donald, Donald Ross.
Where is he? Can you tell us?
Ask him about Donald.
Is it true you are Donald's father?
Good heavens, you speak English!
Donald taught me.
He lives with us since he came to our land.
This is my father.
I'm grateful to you for looking after my son.
Where is he now?
He wants us to go in the house.
We cannot talk here.
Oh, very well. Thank you.
So, what do you mean, they took Donald away?
Who took him?
The Godi's men.
They came with weapons.
The Godi's their high priest.
It was because of the hunter.
He rode down from the mountain, shouting of invaders.
- It was that fellow on the horse.
- Yes.
When The Godi heard, he sounded the long horn.
The long horn is their call to battle.
Battle? What battle?
What has this to do with Donald?
When it was told that one of the invaders was Donald's father,
The Godi said Donald was a spy who came here to betray us to the enemy.
- Surely you don't believe that.
- We don't.
Because we know Donald.
There were many that did believe because there was an omen in the sky.
Omen?
Like a whale, but bigger many times.
My dear girl, that's easily explained.
What the people saw was my airship.
You see, it's like...
It...
It's like one of your boats.
Only it sails in the air.
If I could just talk to this Godi,
I could explain everything.
We're to be taken before the council.
Erik's a member.
You'll get your chance to be heard.
That girl, she speaks better English than Oomiak.
She's prettier too.
If she learned it from Donald, he must have spent a lot of time in her company.
Can you blame him?
I can't say I do, no.
This is like an archaeologist's dream.
To go back in history and walk the earth as it was ten centuries ago.
I suggest you forget the past and start thinking about the future, which from the look of things,
I'd say is not very promising.
The clothes, the weapons, each one of them could be a museum piece.
That's what I don't like.
Those museum pieces.
Look at that.
A Viking longship, exactly the way they were built 1,000 years ago.
Poor fellow.
And it's all my fault.
The temple, that's where we're gonna meet the council.
Ah. Good.
"Go straight to the top," I always say.
Odin, Thor and Freyja.
The greatest of all the Viking gods.
I hope they're on our side.
We may need all the help we can get.
A Viking council.
Straight out of a history book.
There's the girl's father.
He seems a sensible old fellow.
(IVARSSON) They probably call the one with the staff "The Lawspeaker".
They all look reasonable enough.
They might be my board of directors if it weren't for their outlandish costumes.
He said, "Bring out the other prisoner."
- Donald!
- Father!
That's my son!
I've been looking for you.
I thought you might.
It's my son.
- John Ivarsson.
- (IVARSSON) Donald.
- How do you do?
- He's keen on the past. Archaeology.
Sorry about all this.
It's a bit sticky here, I'm afraid.
He says that when I came to this land,
I gave my oath that I came alone and in peace.
But now come others, and with them, an evil omen in the sky
- that cannot be ignored.
- That's my confounded airship.
Let them speak before they are judged.
That is precisely what I wanted to do.
- Father.
- I'll handle this.
You just translate for me.
- What do they call this island?
- Astragard. But, Father...
Shh, shh.
Honoured council of Astragard,
I come to your beautiful country as a friend...
...in peace,
- (SPEAKS IN OLD NORSE)
(ANTHONY) seeking only my son, who was lost to me.
The Godi.
He's telling them not to listen to our lies.
It's obvious that we're barbarians who covet their sacred lands.
And we must be condemned at once.
And without a hearing.
Now look here, I thought
I explained to you...
It is no longer a matter for the council, for the gods have spoken.
If these men are spared, more will come in armed hordes to pillage and profane our sacred land.
There can be but one penalty for the invaders: Death.
(CROWD CHANTING
IN OLD NORSE)
Quite a sendoff.
Full Viking honour.
All very authentic.
Very final.
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Nonsense, my boy.
Donald.
(DONALD) Freyja.
We're in your debt, young lady.
Here they come.
And pull.
The shore. It's our only chance.
You stay here. I will draw them away.
- No, you won't. It's too dangerous.
- He's right, my dear.
It's you they're after, not me.
There is a hunter's cave. Up there.
With food and clothing.
I'll be back when it's safe.
Freyja.
Here they come.
- I think she's done it. Good girl.
- I should never have let her go.
- If they catch her...
- Don't worry, my boy.
- She knows what she's doing.
- Let's find that cave.
Hello.
Oomiak! My dear old friend!
I'm so glad to see you!
- We all are.
- We thought we'd lost you.
You can't kill Oomiak. I hide in water.
Swim like white bear.
Good, good, but let's go.
- What now?
- There's still nothing.
Oh, Ivarsson's up above, scouting around.
Right.
- Morning, Father.
- Hmm? Morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Wretchedly.
You must be a bit done in yourself.
I'm worried about Freyja.
So am I, my boy. So am I.
Well, I've made a mess of it, haven't I?
Of what?
The whole miserable thing, all this nightmare we're living in.
It's all my fault. Every bit of it.
Your fault? Why?
I'm the one who ran off chasing rainbows.
- You're not responsible for that.
- I am.
Right from the beginning.
I was always trying to shape you into my mould.
Bullying, badgering, never letting up.
If I hadn't driven you away, none of this would've happened.
Father, you didn't drive me.
Donald, I rode an airship across the top of the world to tell you this.
If we get out of this, you can do anything you want to do.
You'll be free of me, I promise you.
I don't want to be free of you.
I never did.
I came here looking for adventure.
And I certainly found that.
But I don't belong here.
Now, when we get out of this, and we will, I'm coming home with you.
I want to share in your work and your responsibilities.
If you'll let me.
If I'll let you?
You won't regret it.
I'll see to that.
- (FREYJA) Donald?
- Freyja!
He was quite worried about you.
I went back to the farm.
It'll be just as we arranged.
Father will give us dogs and a sled.
What had you arranged?
For some time, Freyja and I had been planning to leave the island.
We hope to reach Fort Conger.
The two of you, together?
You think I'd leave her behind?
Not if you're your father's son, no.
Boats, they come.
What do we do now?
There's not much cover, but we can get to the top without being seen.
That settles it.
We can't stay here. Those hounds would find us in no time.
Look, The Godi's joined us.
Bloodthirsty pounder.
Come on, everybody. Up we go.
They go. They go!
- (DONALD) They've given up!
- Thank heavens for that.
Look out, Father!
Clumsy of me.
Now the wolves are after us again.
Afraid so, Father.
It's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.
- (ANTHONY) Nasty sort of place.
- Oomiak, go watch below.
- We need somewhere to hide.
- But where? They know this island.
- The Bay of Whales.
- Donald!
It's over there, to the south.
It's sacred, taboo.
The Vikings won't go near it.
That's it, then. Let's go!
No, Donald, please.
- The spirits.
- (DONALD) Freyja, believe me.
- What is it?
- The spirits are good spirits.
Didn't they protect your people when they first came here?
- Surely they'll protect us.
- (OOMIAK) They come. We go.
Freyja, trust me.
Come on up.
Oddly enough, they say this sulphur's good for the lungs.
Sir Anthony, this is hardly the time to rest.
I only hope we soon find that blasted Bay of Whales.
Come on.
My father.
Father!
Burning one minute, freezing the next.
A man could catch his death.
Well, that's what's so interesting about the Arctic. It's a contradiction.
- In my first expedition to Bathenland...
- Ivarsson, please. Stop!
What we need is a conference.
Conference? About what, Father?
If we find the Bay of Whales and if it's true The Godi won't follow us there, what do we do then?
We lie low.
Make our way across the mountains to Freyja's farm.
- We can't go back through that.
- No, no. We find iceboat. Float.
- Very good.
- (ANTHONY) Boat?
What's he talking about?
He wants to find a piece of pack ice and float around the mountain.
Preposterous.
Where the whales go to die.
All those great creatures from every sea, lying there, from the beginning of time.
Just look at all that whalebone.
Worth millions of pounds.
And heaven knows what price the ambergris would fetch.
All that doesn't matter now, does it, Father?
Freyja, don't be afraid.
Think of the saga.
Doesn't it tell how, long ago, it was the whales that led your people here?
Where they found peace and happiness, so there's nothing to fear.
Believe me.
We need iceboat.
How we get down there?
Yes, how?
Not down these cliffs, obviously.
There must be a way.
The Vikings found one.
Is it in the saga?
Does it tell how they came up?
With the help of the gods.
It is told that he came through the mouth of hell.
- That's not very explicit, I'm afraid.
- Wait a minute.
That volcano in Iceland, Mount Hekla.
The early Christians believed that was the entrance to hell.
- What?
- Entrance.
It's a wild thought. Come on.
- The crater of a dead volcano.
- Quiet.
You hear that? Down there, there's an underground river.
The river flows to the sea, which means there is a passage from the crater to the bay.
Ho, ho.
Come on.
Look, the water's running out.
- Come on.
- (ANTHONY) Where to?
Wherever the water went.
Look!
Do not worry.
I have sailed this way many times.
It's not this I'm worried about.
It's them.
Will they never give up?
I can't understand why the bowmen haven't been shooting.
They do not have to.
- They only wait to see us die.
- Freyja.
It's taught in the sagas that the bay is guarded by sea beasts.
We cannot escape.
- Killer whales.
- (ANTHONY) What do we do now?
Anything we can.
Here comes the other one.
Hold on, everybody!
The Hyperion!
And heaven be praised, our old friend the captain.
(ANTHONY) My compliments,
Captain. You keep an excellent table.
And you're an excellent shot.
You saved our lives.
- Thank you.
- An unexpected pleasure.
Since I landed two days ago,
I've been trying to save my own.
But getting out of here, that's going to be quite a problem.
- Isn't it, Captain?
- I have the solution.
My ship may be battered and torn, but the mind that conceived it, that still functions.
As you see, the ship has lost much gas, but it retains some buoyancy.
So if we reduce sufficiently the weight, then it will rise.
How would you reduce the weight?
Abandon the motors.
The propellers are broken anyway.
The gondola too.
Strip the ship of everything that weights it down.
What have we then?
- A free balloon.
- By Jove!
- It'd carry us across the bay.
- If we can reach the pack ice...
We shall go farther than that.
The prevailing wind is to the south.
If it holds, we should drift to Greenland.
When we reach the coast, we descend and proceed on foot to the nearest habitation.
Capt. Brieux, you are a very remarkable man.
I've always felt so.
- Sir Anthony.
- This is a bit much, isn't it?
Hardly the time for ceremonies.
Let's be off.
Please, Sir Anthony, this is a moment to be savoured.
Once more, we stand on the threshold of a great adventure.
To my Hyperion.
May she rise.
Like a phoenix from the ashes of despair.
And soar like Man's imagination to Greenland and beyond.
The Hyperion.
- Now, let's get going, shall we?
- (BRIEUX) Of course, Monsieur.
I will show you now the ingenious arrangements
I've made for our departure.
Perhaps you have observed that I've cut loose the gondola.
The ship is now attached to it by a single cable.
So also the motors and the tail.
This section, too, linked to the ship only by a cable.
When I slip these cables, the gondola, the motors and the tail detach themselves, and we rise.
Are you sure?
You will see.
Now, gentlemen, if you will assist me.
The gondola.
The motors and the tail.
When I say three, pull with all your force.
Right.
- Permission to proceed, Monsieur?
- What?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, proceed.
Very well.
One...
...two...
...three!
Well, Sir Anthony.
It worked perfectly.
Once again, Captain,
I underestimated you.
I'm turning in. I haven't had a good night's sleep since England.
- Sir Anthony.
- Hmm?
Take a look.
Campfires.
So they're still waiting for us.
It's a pity we'll have to disappoint them.
What is it?
You look frightened.
- A little.
- No, you mustn't be. It's all over.
We're safe now.
I know.
It is not that.
What, then?
It is the world beyond our mountains, your world.
Our world isn't really so different.
It's bigger, and everything moves faster.
We live by clocks and machines instead of tides and seasons.
You'll get used to it.
And be happy.
Because you'll be surrounded by people you love and who love you.
I wish my father could be with us.
I know.
But his home is Astragard.
His heart will always be here.
Mine is with you.
Ivarsson.
When does the first ship leave Greenland in the spring?
Usually, the beginning of April.
So with luck, we should be back in England in about six weeks.
I should not count on it, Monsieur.
The wind has changed.
We are drifting back to the land.
Well, can't something be done?
I cannot command the wind, Monsieur.
- We're rising.
- Got draft.
The wind against the cliffs.
What happens when we get to the top?
Everybody out. Quick.
It's true that the gods were angry, but it was The Godi who did wrong by leading the people to hatred and to violence.
I'm glad they recognise that.
The prisoners may go in peace on this condition, that they swear a sacred oath.
Never to reveal the existence of this sacred island.
That's fair enough.
To ensure that the oath be honoured for all time, we must demand one thing.
Well, go on. What is it?
That you leave a hostage here.
Your son.
I refuse to discuss it any further.
How could they imagine
I would leave you behind?
- Those are their terms!
- I will not permit it.
Without a hostage, none of us will leave.
- Blasted! Then I'll be the hostage.
- (IVARSSON) I don't think so.
As a matter of fact, everything's already been arranged.
And very satisfactorily for everybody, I think.
Are you sure it's what you want?
Are you sure you want to be left behind?
Yes, I'm sure.
This is a chance no archaeologist could turn down.
Not only to study the past, but to relive it. Here it all is.
Hidden behind mist for 1,000 years, and I haven't scratched the surface.
Besides, who says
I'm being left behind?
We archaeologists take a longer view.
Whole civilisations have vanished before, you know.
The day may come when this might be Man's last refuge.
Good luck.
Goodbye, my friends!

Ladies and gentlemen!
200 motels
200 motels . . . Life on the road!
Ladies and gentlemen! and here is . . .
Who?
Larry the dwarf!
Larry likes to dress up funny
Tonight he's dressed up like Frank Zappa
Let's ask him "What's the deal?"
Hi Larry, it's good to have you back on our panel.
Hi Dave, it's really great to be back on your panel.
I'm sure the people at home would be interested to know why such a large dwarf as you is all dressed up like Frank Zappa.
Tell us Larry, eh . . . what's the deal?
He made me do it, Dave. He's such a creep.
He's making me hold this alladin.
And why is he making you do that, Larry?
He wants me to fuck the girl with the harp.
He wants you to fuck the girl . . . with the harp?
No, no, with the magic lamp. He wants me to stuff it up her and rub it.
Hm. Hm-hm-hm. Ho-ho-ho, ha-ha. A-HA-HA-HA-HO-HO.
Let's ask our studio audience. If you'd just been lowered down here on TV by a wire connected to a brown leather harness, forced by a crazy person to insert a mysterious, imported lamp into the reproductive-rep-rep-rep into-into the rep-rep-reproductive orifice of a lady harpist and you were a dwarf . . . would you do it?
YES!!!
Yay!
Let's spin the big wheel, Larry! Go ahead, give it a whirl!
What our studio audience doesn't know is that the reason Larry the Dwarf is doing all this stuff is because its all part of the score to 200 Motels. Every word, every action, the lamp, the reproductive orifice, it's all in the score, so he has to do it. This whole event is a fantasy that occurred touring on the road. Touring can make you crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
That is precisely what 200 Motels is all about.
Say!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
How long?

Special delivery for Mr. Volman! Mr. Volman?
Are you Volman?
It's a double cheeseburger from a famous American burger chain, with a symbol in the parking lot that's yellow plastic and goes like this:
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
. . . In a steaming briefcase!
You're Volman!
Yeh-No. No. He's Volman. Who are you?
You must call me "Rance Muhammitz."
"Rance Muhammitz"? Stupidest name I ever heard of.
Yah, but you must remember that within the conceptual framework of this filmic event, nothing really matters! It is entirely possible for several subjective realities to coexist. It is possible that all things are a deception of the senses.
Right on, Rance! The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake, artifical food coloring.
By the way. Mr. Volman, I have . . . YOUR CHEESEBURGER.
We must evolve.
Yeah . . .
We must progress.
Progress . . .
There must be growth!
Yeah . . . macrobiotic foods and tie-dye shirts!
Hey, ya ain't gonna eat that cheeseburger, Mark? . . . (BURP)
Fucking guy will eat anything.
This is registered delivery, you will have to sign for it.
Sure man, I'll sign. Where's the pencil?
I don't wish to alarm you, my son, but the signature will have to be . . . in blood.
Listen man, I just wanna know two things. Is there any beer in this fake nightclub, and when do we get paid?
Just-just a minute, just a minute, in a moment or two you'll be able to get your hands on all the imaginary beer that you want. For the moment, I would like to explain some of the things that you'll all be doing in this movie.
I've been wondering about that.
For Sherwood, we have a vacuum cleaner scheduled . . .
A vacuum cleaner?
. . . and a potential epileptic seizure during a production number later on.
A vacuum cleaner!
I thought the two of you would like to get acquainted.
It says here that you are supposed to be in love.
This abnormal relationship will be great for the big story I'm going to write!
Listen man, I just wanna know one thing: when do we get paid?
No look, look, look, look, look, don't you even care what you do?
So long as I get some beer and I get paid, you can make me do anything, I'm professional!
You should be careful talkin' about that stuff.
Why, does he listen?
He always listens. He always watches and listens to all the guys in the band. I've been in the band for years, and I know. He always listens.
That's how he gets all his material! It isn't s'posed to be natural, friendly, good-natured, humorous, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, YEAH, WELL FINE!
. . . and then he rips it off, and he sneaks off into a secret room someplace, and boils it in ammonia, and he gets it perverted, and THEN he brings it back to us at rehearsal and makes us play it!
Hey man, what's that over there?
It's HIM. You can see him, he's watching.
D'ya think he heard us?
I've been in the band for years. You can bet that he heard everything.
Yeah, let's go over and pretend to be nice to him.
Yeah, let's go over and pretent we don't know he's watching.
Yeah, and rippin' off all our good material.
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hey, Frank!
Hey, that's a GREAT new song you wrote, you know, the one about the penis and everything? I was laughin' a lot the whole time I was learnin' it!
Yeah, we were all laughin', Frank!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha YEAH, WELL FINE!
Yeah, it took a little while to get into it man, but once we got the drift, phew!
Yeah, there's lots of great parts you've got in there for the chorus, you know when they go:
RAN-TAN-RAN-TOON-RAN-TAN-TAN . . .
And I steal the room and everything, you know. I don't even mind you rippin' it off from me, just as long as I get paid.
Oh, and I don't even mind the part where he says, "what can I say about this fabulous elixir," so long as me and
Howard and Jeff Simmons who left the group just before the movie started get credit for special material! Ha-ha-ha!
I'm deeply offended by your lack of artistic sense.
Look here, Muhammitz, or whatever the fuck they call ya, I don't even give a shit man, I got five fuckin' kids at home and . . . can you lend me a coupla bucks until the end of the week? Who are you, anyway?
Oh, she writes for the Imaginary Rock and Roll newspaper in San Francisco.
San Francisco?
Man!
Oh! Eh, he's making me leave here now.
I'll see you later when we play.
What?
I don't expect you to understand that, because uh, we haven't formed the group yet.
Ah, Mark will play the bass . . .
Ba-doom-doom-doom-doom . . .
Howie will sing and play sax . . .
Dwee-dat-dwee-dat-dweet-dat-dwee-dat . . .
I'll play the guitar . . . woop-doo-doo-doo . . . and the dwarf here will play drums!
Waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit! This guy isn't even a dwarf!
That's one of the reasons the group will be so commercial!
Ah. What about the other guys?
Ah, they're already forming groups all over the place! Why wait till the end of the movie, we could have a hit single right now!
He's right, he's right! We don't need Aynsley . . .
No . . . We don't need Ian . . .
No . . . We don't need George!
No! We don't need anybody! Argh!
No!
He needs us, remember. We don't need him! All those other guys are too old for rock. They're out of it! We could have a tight little heavy little band with this dwarf here. You know, that he, he used to play drums for Leon Russell . . .
Ohh . . .
Listen, you're right. Zappa's 30.
Yeah, man.
Ohh . . . whew . . .
Thirty years old . . .
Oh, he's out of it man! He's too old, he should retire.
Yeah, really. You can't trust old people. You know, we should take up a collection and buy him a watch.
I don't know too much about this stuff
I've been a little busy
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long

I hear birds!
What's he saying?
You took the mystery burger! You are in full posession of
. . . the burger! Do you know who I am? Hm? Do you know
Who I really am?
Really man! WHO . . . DO YOU THINK . . . YOU ARE?
Yeah, do you want me to tell you WHO . . .
I really think you are?
Yeah, somebody tell me WHO is this guy?
Centerville
A real nice place to raise your kids up
Centerville
It's really neat!
Churches
Churches
And liquor stores
Oh, yeah! It's
Just like Glendale
Look!
Over there
It's a rancid boutique!
Janet, did you see those guys with the hair?
It's those guys from the fake stage across the street from our house.
Eww, I get so excited when someone from a group gets near me. I just . . . eww, I just . . .
Don't you have any taste? That one guy's got gray hair, and the other one's too fat.
Oh, they look so lonely.
Lonely? Good evening honey, they look desperate. Desperate pop stars are so depressing when they've been on the road for such a long time, and they finally get some action.
They drool on you.
Really. All that stuff that comes out of their mouth when they're on top of you. It's so moche. Ew.
Ew, on the pillows.
But I like the drummer with the rivets on his clothes, he's not bad.
Yeah, I've seen him too. He just screams
"Englishness," with that little haircut and the rings . . .
And the binoculars.
Binoculars?
Didn't you notice his binoculars?
No, he's got binoculars?
He watches us through them, he's a pervert!
Oh, I get so hot just thinking about perversions . . . Maybe when we go down to the fake nightclub tonight we can meet him, and find out if he really is perverted.
Just take my word for it; he is perverted.
Mmm. And English, too.
They're all that way.

You just called me, didn't you?
All I said was "Opal, you hot little bitch".
I am known by many names.
Mm-hmm. You got many friends who call you
"Opal the hot little bitch"?
Please-please-please-please Mr. Black, let us cut the small talk, and get on with your briefing.
Fine, you can brief me all you want as long as you can tell me two things . . .

Very well, Mr. Black. Oh, by the way. I have here the special beer I promised you earlier.
Oh man, it's about time, I've been waiting.
Would you care to sign for it?
This is a pencil?
No, Mr. Black, it is a pin.
A PIN?
Would you jab yourself in the finger with it?
Listen, Mo-hannitz, I may be professional, but I'm not THAT professional. I just want my beer.
Sign first! In blood.
Fuck you! Who do you think you are, the devil or something?
I am known by many names.
You probably got some more weird names for yourself, but I'll tell you one thing you ain't nev-, definitely ain't never gonna be called and that's the devil, because you ain't the devil.
Oh, I'm not?
You bet your sweet ass you're not. The fuckin' devil's got an english accent.
I seen him three weeks ago on TV. So you know, you can just take this big needle here and hang it in your ass as far as I'm concerned! (cough) Fuckin' guy musta been a communist!
Hello there. When you go on tour with a musical group, it's possible that any town can seem like this.
Whether it's large or small, or busy, or if there's nothing happening in it.
The reason for this is quite simple. A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent god-fearing citizen, and the life he leads, in many ways, seems useless and irrelevant to those of us who'd prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer. Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people. Many of them study for years, learning to play the violin for instance, only to be rewarded with a humdrum job in the fourth row of a symphonic string section.
That's why the governments have constructed, at great expense, this experimental reorientation facility.
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless old musicians with their brown fiddles and little horns.
Give them a trade! A reason to exist in the modern world! A chance of a happier, more productive life.
Some will enter the military, some will learn shorthand, and some will disappear in the middle of the night on a special train they're sending in.
It's the only way, really, to bring about the final solution to the orchestra question.
I'm sure that many of us realize that a pop group can earn a vast amount of money compared to these other kinds of musicians. That's why the special government agencies for mass response programming and psychological stultification prefer to treat them in a more subtle manner.
They know, just as many of you vigilant and thoroughly upstanding citizens have discovered for yourselves, the power of pop music to corrupt and putrify the minds of world youth are virtually limitless.

Don't you treat me cold

They're driving me crazy.

No no no!
Man! This stuff is great! It's just as if Donovan himself had appeared on my very own TV with words of peace, love, and eternal cosmic wisdom . . . ! Leading me. Guiding me. On paths of everlasting pseudo-karmic negligence, in the very midst of my drug-induced nocturnal emission.
For I am your good conscience, Jeff. I know all. I see all. I am a cosmic love pulse matrix, becoming a technicolor interpositive!
Huh? Where'd you buy that incense? It's hip.
It's the same and mysterious exotic oriental fragrance as what the Beatles get off on.
I thought I recognized it . . . Sniff, sniff . . . Mmm, what is that, MUSK? Sniff, sniff, sniff . . . mmmh!
Jeff, I know what's good for you.
Right. You're heavy.
Yes, Jeff, I am your guiding light. Listen to me.
Don't rip off the towels, Jeff!
Piss off, you little nitwit!
Hey man, what's the deal?
Don't listen to him, Jeff, he's no good. He'll make you do BAD THINGS!
You mean, he'll make me sin?
Yes, Jeff. SIN!
Wow!
Jeff, I'd like to have a word with you . . . about your soul.
No, don't listen, Jeff.
Why are you wasting your life, night after night playing this comedy music?
You're right, I'm too heavy to be in this group.
Comedy music . . .
Jeff, YOUR SOUL!
Oh, ah Oh, you're wasting your life
To be . . .
Ah Oh, ah Ah, ah
Too heavy, Jeff
In this group, all I ever get to do is play Zappa's comedy music. HE EATS!
Jeff!
I get so tense!
Of course you do, my boy.
The stuff he makes me do is always off the wall!
That's why it would be best to leave his stern employ.
And quit the group!
You'll make it big!
That's right.
Of course!
And then I won't be SMALL!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ti-diddly-diddly-dee
Ha, ha, ha . . .

This is the real you, Jeff. Rip off a few more ashtrays. Get rid of some of that inner tension. Quit the comedy group!
Get your own group together. Heavy! Like GRAND FUNK! Or BLACK SABBATH . . .
No, Jeff . . .
Or COVEN!
Peace . . . Love . . .
Bollocks!
What can I say about this elixir?
What?
WOWWWWWW!
What can I?

What?
What can I say about this?

Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the French Riviera at the MIDEM convention. A fake tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and customized by Rantoon
Tan, Hantoon Frammin, and DEE . . .
Followed by twelve potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice, with your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner office, and Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets on Air Rangoon.
Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a fake rock and roll guitar player in a comedy group?

I'm going to die. I know I'm going to die, I can tell because my pulse is so weak. The pills . . . I took so many downers that I know this is the end for me.
You poor thing. You want us to fix your hair for you so you look good when they find you?
Oh . . . would you?
Sure, whaddyawant? A ponytail? A flat-top with fenders?
I'm gonna die, Janet, I'm gonna O.D.! So, make me look good.
Listen, the best I can do for you is fix your hair, so why don't you get up and wash that melted eye makeup off your face.
Is it smeared? I've been crying so much . . . it's so damn sad when you know you'll never see all your friends anymore.
Every week it's the same old thing. You're gonna die. You're gonna die. Somebody went out on you. Somebody doesn't love you anymore. How long you been a groupie? You should get used to romances which are so obviously cheap. Listen, just in case you crash out, and the imaginary rock and roll newspaper from San Francisco wants to get any pictures of you, you'll look like you washed your face. Really.
It's better this way with a clean face.
People think groupies are such dirty girls.
Heh . . . I wouldn't mind sort of fucking all three of them!
Look, over there!
What?
He's doing it, he's watching us from the fake bandstand with the binoculars!
Who, the English dude?
Oh, rivet-boy!
The rivet boy? Where?
Over there, wipe that stuff out of your eyes.
It looks like he's beating off.
Beating off? I knew he was a pervert.
Eww, how exciting. Hey, are you still trying to O.D.?
Yes, this definitely is the end for me!
I feel so faint! So weak!
Good evening honey, that was the most imaginary collapse I've seen since last week.
Janet, do you think she's going to die?
Are you kidding? Did you see her hit the floor?
God, well it was so obviously cheap. Lift up your head, honey.
I'm going to die. This time it's real.
Listen, Lucy, we gotta get ready for our big dance number, we're going to the fake nightclub tonight.
Everything's getting dim.
Why don't you tell her a story while you put your makeup on? Good evening.
Oh. Listen, toots. I'm going to make up a nice little fairy tale for you.
The pills, the Mandrax, I took so many of them.
I'll tell you part of the story, and then you make up another part that goes along with it. Once upon a time there was a tall, handsome, muscular . . .
Dwarf.
. . . with a very special . . .
Swedish apparatus!
. . . that him and his friends would use in c onjunction with . . .
Bold new surgical experiments!
. . . involving . . .
A bludgeon, and a bottle of champagne . . .
. . . and a . . .
. . . microwave oven . . .
. . . from a . . .
. . . jumbo jet, one of the big jobs leased from
Air Rangoon!
. . . which, when used correctly . . .
. . . can effectively increase the dimensions . . .
. . . and firepower of your . . .
. . . dick . . .
. . . to the point where . . .
. . . in some instances, it should be classified as a lethal weapon!
Your dick!
Your dick?
Your dork!
Your dork?
Your prick!
Your prick?
Your pork!
Your pork?
Your pork?
Who calls it a pork? These men, and the stuff they call a wee-wee!
A wee-wee?
You mean a penis, don't you?
A penis?
Penis is such an ugly word.
It's not that ugly, really.
Sure, I-I use it all the time.
Sure, sure, we all say it every once in a while. Listen:
PENIS.
Ewww!
Penis! Penis!
Ew, it sounds so revolting the way you guys say it. Ew, ka-ka.
Ka-ka!
The penis can be a very useful organ.
Yeah, and very exciting, too, once you get to know me.
Oh, yeah, right, yeah, etc . . .
Penis!
It sounds so overwhelmingly medicinal.
A penis sounds like something a doctor would have hanging off of him.
None of the men I know and love in the rock and roll business got penises. They all got cocks or dicks at least.
Sure, you want to go strap on a pop star, and he wants to stick a penis up you, where is that at?
Let's ask our studio audience!
Will you trade what he has in his pants for what I have behind this curtain?
What is it?
You mean what's in his pants?
I know what's in his pants, he's a lonely guy.
You have to choose before the big wheel stops whirling. You! Hey, buddy! Sky marshall! Go whirl the big wheel!
Can I just take the money?
There isn't any money, just the curtain and . . .
. . . the lonely guy.
Time is running out, think it over carefully.
The curtain!
I want the money.
Wait! What could it be in there?
In his pants?
In the curtain!
Doesn't anybody care what's in my pants?
Penis dimension
Penis dimension
Penis dimension is worrying me
I can't hardly sleep at night
'Cause of penis dimension
Do you worry?
Do you worry a lot?
No!
Do you worry?
Do you worry and moan . . .
That the size of your cock is not monstrous enough?
It's your penis dimension!
Penis dimension!
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Hiya friends. Now just be honest about it. Did you ever consider the possiblity that your penis, and in the case of many dignified ladies, that the size of the titties themselves might provide elements of sub-conscious tension? Weird, twisted anxieties that could force a human being to have to become a politician!
A policeman!
A Jesuit monk
A rock and roll guitar player! A wino! You name it. Or in the case of the ladies, the ones that can't afford a silicone
BEEF-UP, they become writers of hot books
"Manuel, the gardener, placed his burning phallus in her quivering quim."
Yes, or they become Carmelite nuns!
"Gonzo, the lead guitar player, placed his mutated member in her slithering slit." Ha ha ha! Ooh . . .
Or race horse jockeys. There is no reason why you or your loved ones should suffer. Things are bad enough, without the size of your organ adding even more misery to the TROUBLES OF THE WORLD!
Right on, right on!
Now, if you're a lady and you've got munchkin tits, you can console yourself with this age-old line from primary school:
ANYTHING OVER A MOUTHFUL IS WASTED! YES!
And isn't it the truth? And if you're a guy, and one night you're at a party and you're trying to be cool, I mean, you aren't even wearing any underwear, you're being so cool, and somebody hits on you one night, and he looks you up and down and he says, uh . . .
Eight inches or less?
Well let me tell you, brothers, that's the time when you've got to turn around and look that sonofabitch right between the eyes, and you got to tell him these words:
I stuff three pair of socks and a bar of beauty soap down in front of my pants!
She painted up her face
She sat before the mirror
She painted up her face
She drew the mirror nearer
Practisissing, Practiss, Practicing!
The STARE!
The STARE!
(The 'secret stare' she would use
If a worthy-looking victim should appear)
Practisissing, Practiss, Practicing!
Practisissing, Practiss, Practicing!
The clock upon the wall
Has struck the midnight hour!
She finishes her call;
Her girlfriend's in the shower
Practisissing, Practiss, Practicing!
Half a dozen provocative squats!
Out of the shower, she squeezes her spots;
Brushes her teeth;
Shoots a deodorant spray up her twat . . .
(It's getting her, getting her
Hot--Oh-woh-woh-woh-woh-woh)
She's just twenty-four
And she can't get off,
A sad but typical case, yeah
Last dude to do her
Got in and got soft;
She blew it,
And laughed in his face, yeah!
Face, yeah!
Yeah
She chooses all the clothes
She'll wear tonight to dance in!
The places that she goes
Are filled with guys from groups,
Waiting for a chance to break her pants in
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
Well, at least there's sort of a choice there;
Twenty or thirty at times there have been--
Somewhat desirable boys there--
Dressed really spiffy, with long hair--
Waiting for girls they can shove it right in
Well, at least there's sort of a choice there;
Twenty or thirty at times there have been--
Somewhat desirable boys there--
Dressed really spiffy, with long hair--
Waiting for girls they can shove it right in
Hello there. All the guys in the band are pretending to get ready so they can go out and find some pussy.
Oh, I wonder where the action is in this town?
Every musician likes to find some pussy.
Boy, I coulda really scored last night. But every night its the same thing; Aynsley gets there first. He's so FAST . . . it must be from playing the drums or something. I mean . . . if those girls over there only knew my secret identity, but
. . . but how COULD they? How- how could they know that I am Bwana Dik?
Where's my hair dryer? Got to look lovely for the girls. After all, I am Bwana Dik.
Each guy has his own speciality for getting the girl of his dreams.
I sprayed my pits . . . I put on a new tie-dye t-shirt . . . I brushed my teeth . . .
I cleaned my glasses . . .
I buffed my nails.
I bought a copy of Down Beat so I could carry it around and look like I knew what was happening.
I left my shirt unbuttoned at the top . . .
I just KNOW I'm gonna get laid tonight. I'm not taking any chances. I got this little jar of tinsel glitter here . . . the same brand Danny Hutton puts on his face that makes him look all . . . glistening and seductive. Just put a little on here . . . the cheeks . . . the chin . . . mmm, the quivering lips . . . I'm so commercial I could die! Somebody . . .
TURN ON A BLUE SPOTLIGHT!!!
What will this morning bring me this evening?
Some local hot action
Before we are leaving (maybe we can get some head)
Go to the club or the bar or wherever the pussy is found
In the town your band is booked to play in
It's always a little bit harder to score
If it's just your first time in a town you never hit before
If you stayed in it once and got laid
You've got it made, ahhh, got it made
If it's just your first time
Then you know it's no fun to go
Back to a plastic hotel all alone
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Or wherever the pussy is found
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
She's such a dignified lady
She's so pretty and soft
You can't call her a groupie
It just pisses her off
She got diamonds and jewelry
She got lotsa new clothes
She ain't hurtin' for money
So that everyone knows
That she knows what she wants
Knows what she likes
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . she's got her eyes on you
She left her place after midnight
And she drove to the club
You know that her and her partner
Came here lookin' for love
They want a guy from a group
Got a thing in a charts
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
They will give him their hearts
'Cause they know what they want
And they know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . they got their eyes on you
FAM-BAM-YAK-A-TA-TAHHH!
They know what they want
Know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Awright, you got 'em screamin' all night
Screamin' all night
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Bentley!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Chevy!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Or a Lincoln!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
['Cause they're dancin'!]
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo . . .
Oh wow, what a night. What's the matter, didn't you get any action tonight?
Didn't you used to be with the Mothers?
Yeah.
Is this what you do now?
I've got my own group, too. I don't mind being in this movie. I get a chance to transform a few times, drink these vile, foamy liquids.
Bleagh.
What kind of a life is that?
It's not that bad! Really! I LIKE to be a monster every once in awhile!
No one will ever take you seriously after this.
Why, because I transform? I LIKE to be a monster!
There's a little monster in every one of us.
You'll probably stay here for the rest of your life with your fake potions and your twisted monster face. You coulda
BEEN something in rock and roll.
I TRIED to get a hit single. It drove me to drink.
Ugh.
Hoo-hoo-ha-ha . . .
Go on, laugh about it. You could have been a star. You could have spread your aura across vast continental areas, your name on millions of small, hot lips, whispering under secure, pink blankets in the lonely midnight dark. But whaddya do? Ya join the Mothers, and ya end up working for Zappa, and he makes you be a creep! You coulda played the blues with John Mayall, or far-out exciting jazz with Blood Sweat and Tears.
You really think so?
Look. No one will ever take you seriously after this. How can they take you seriously? In this business you've either got to play the blues or sing with a high voice.
You're right. I never should have joined the Mothers. Why, I could be a star now! Oh, when I think of all those millions of . . .
Hey.
Hot pink juicy little . . .
Hey. Listen, do you know where I can uh, get any dope in this imaginary town?
Man, there's no dope in this town. Just these vile, foamy liquids.
Well, they're fake aren't they?
No, they're real! I mix them myself at home, and then I bring them in the morning . . . secret spiritual formulas . . .
Ew, what's a secret spiritual formula?
The stuff that goes in the elixir, the potion, whatever
I mix is irrelevant to the result.
You mean they're fake potions, right?
Look, it doesn't matter what's in the mix. It's the liquid! The concept . . . of the liquid . . . is enough to trigger a special cosmic state. Its because I'm so spiritually evolved . . .
Oh, listen, I just wanna get out of it, and go back to me fake motel room and play the blues, you know. Fuck your spiritual evolvement. Anyway, what happens if a new and exciting blues talent such as meself drinks your stuff?
Here. Take this back to your fake room.
Drink it.
I'd feel a lot happier if there was something I could smoke.
Well, here. Dip this in it. Now, let it dry out. That ought to get you a little HIGH. Or something.
Ew, I can't take you seriously.
Look, you might as well take this too.
I know its only fake potion. Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues.
Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks?
White people can play the blues, you know.
Hello. Frank. Yeah, I gave it to him.
Yeah, he went back to the special room.
No, no. He's gonna smoke it. Yeah, right.
Hey, listen. You got any idea when we're gonna get paid for this?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
A succulent fat one
A mod little flat one
Maybe a hot one (to give me the clap!)
Maybe a freak who gets off with a strap
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues. Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? White people can play the blues, you know. Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? Why not some extended blues licks?
Yeah, I gave it to him. Yeah, he went back to the special room. No, no. He's gonna smoke it.
Jeff has gone out there on that stuff!
He should have never have used the elixir and only stuck to the incense. Oh, Atlantis . . .
That was BILLY THE MOUNTAIN, dressed up like Donovan, fading out on the wall-mounted TV screen. Jeff IS flipping out. Road fatigue! We've got to get him back to normal before Zappa finds out, and steals it, and makes him do it in the movie!
You have a brilliant career ahead of you, my boy,
Just GET OUT OF THIS GROUP!
Howard, that was Studebacher Hoch, dressed up like Jim Pons, giving career guidance to the bass player of a rock-oriented comedy group. Jeff's imagination has gone beyond the fringe of audience comprehension.
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, the Phlorescent Leech!
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, Eddie!
I'm stealing the towels! Ha ha . . . ha ha . . .
Stealing the room
Stealing the . . . Stealing the room
I'm  I'm
Stealing  Stealing
I'm  I'm  Stealing
This, as you might have gathered, is the end of the movie. The entire cast is assembled here at the Centerville
Recreational Facility to bid farewell to you, and to express thanks for your attendance at this theater.
This might seem old fashioned to some of you, but I'd like to join in on this song.
It's the kind of a sentimental song that you get at the end of a movie, , it's the kind of a song that people might sing to let you in the audience know that we really like you and care about you, yeah . . .
Understand how hard it is to laugh these days, with all the terrible problems in the world!
Lord, have mercy on the people in England
For the terrible food these people must eat
And may the Lord have mercy on the fate of this movie
And God bless the mind of the man in the street
Help all the rednecks and the flatfoot policemen
On the terrible functions they all must perform
God help the winos, the junkies, and the weirdos
And every poor soul who's adrift in the storm.
Help everybody, so they all get some action
Some love on the weekend, some real satisfaction
A room and a meal
And a garbage disposal
A lawn and a hose'll
Be strictly genteel
Lord, have mercy on the hippies and faggots
And the dykes and the weird little children they grow
Help the black man
Help the poor man
Help the milk man
Help the door man
Help the lonely, neglected old farts that I know
Well, it certainly has been swell . . .
If your name wasn't on the list of blessings we've been passing out tonight, we don't want you to be pissed off.
No . . .
We don't want you to leave that theater.
Forgive him, for he knows not what he does.
But before we go on, I'd like to introduce to you . . .
On the other hand, maybe he does know . . .
. . . my good friend and musical associate, Mr. Howard Kaylan who's about to give us a closing final benediction.
They're gonna clear out the studio
They're gonna tear down all the . . .
They're gonna whip down all the . . .
They're gonna sweep out all the . . .
They're gonna pay off all the . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
Hey hey hey, everybody in the orchestra and the chorus
Talkin' 'bout every one of our lovely and talented dancers
Talkin' 'bout the light bulb men
Camera men
The make-up men
Yeah, the rake-up men
They're all gonna rise up
They're gonna jump up
I said jump up
Talkin' 'bout jump right up and off the floor
Jump right up and hit the door
They're all gonna rise up and jump off!
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
And once again
Take themselves
Seriously, yeeeah!
Two, three, four, seriously
They're all gonna go home (ye-hey!)
Through the driving sleet and rain
They're all gonna go home
Through the fog, through the dust
Through the tropical fever and the blistering frost
They're all gonna go home
And get out of it as they can be, baby
And the same goes for me
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
And each and every member of this rock oriented comedy group in his own special way
Is gonna get out of it as he can be
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
And I am definitely gonna get . . .
REAMED
'Cause I'm such a lonely
I'm such a lonely
A lonely, lonely, talkin' 'bout a lonely guy!
Oh, and I know tonight, I am definitely . . .
I am positively . . .
I just have to get . . .
BENT, REAMED AND WASTED
A disaster area the size of Atlantic City, New Jersey!
He's making me do this, ladies and gentlemen. I wouldn't do it if it weren't for him. You noticed, all through this material, I've been glancing over toward my left? Well, I'll tell you the reason for that, ladies and gentlemen. HE is over there. HE is over on the left. HE is the guy that is making me do all this shit. Right over there.
Now all through this movie, every time we've been on stage, I've had to look over in that direction, right?
You saw it . . . you know. Well that's 'cause HE's over there. I've got to watch him for signs.
He jumps up and down like a jackass. I can't even believe the guy sometimes.
But we gotta watch him. "After all," we said,
"it's Frank's movie."
Now, we're THE MOTHERS, but it's still Frank's movie.
Let's say it, he got to paid for it, he rented the studio, had all these cheesy sets built . . .
It's so moche! I can't even stand it . . .
He's telling everybody, right now, right over there, to . . .

Dear Tommy,
200 MOTELS
I would be grateful if you would ensure that all meals, bar bills and orders for coffee, etc., are, from this date forwards, to be paid for by the person ordering them.
The only exceptions to this rule are the personnel listed on the other memo I have sent you.

Planet Jilutia
The planet of Jilutia was dying.
This planet was once beautiful and full of life but the Empire of Gabanas had attacked them and taken over, and Jilutia became their for-tress.
Kido, the leader of Jilutia, had his sixty soldiers fight the Gabanas army but they were hopeless against them.
The holy spirit of Universe, please forgive my mistakes and bring a miracle to help us.
These eight holy seeds will seek out eight brave warriors, and let these brave warriors bring forth a miracle.
Let the miracle happen. To the far reaches of the universe!
Emerarida
Yes, grandfather.
Follow those Reyabe seeds.
You must leave at once. When you find and bring the eight brave warriors here, we shall be saved.
Yes.
Master!
Please let me go with her so I can protect her.
Oh, yes, ifa strong man like you accompanies her, then I am confident you will succeed in the quest.
If anything happens to Emerarida, you must continue with the quest no matter what. Understood, Uroooo'?
Yes, sir!
Emerarida, Never forget that the people of
Jilutia's destiny rests on your shoulders.
Yes, grandfather, I understand.
Gabanas Fortress
We have not had such a storm for a long time. It kind of feels good.
Your majesty!
Wh at?
Yes, one of the Jilutian spaceships is attempting to escape.
Whatl?
Please come and see for yourself.
They are trying to find some help from other planets.
But I'm sure there is nobody in this universe who would go against me.
No, don't be so sure about that.
This infinite universe reaches far and wide. Anything could happen.
Oh, mother, you worry too much.
No. I saw eight glowing Reyabe seeds fly away into the sky.
Wh at?
Reyabe seeds are the sacred guardians of Jilutia.
If nothing is done about this, something terrible could happen to us.
Destroy that spaceship immediately.
Urocco! Are you OK?
This is nothing to me
Planet Milazeria
In this time of the era the Earthlings were exploring other planets within the Milky Way galaxy to find resources and land to inhabit.
Captain! Captain!
What is it, miss?
What is that?
Huh? Oh, that is an asteroid belt.
It is well known around Milazeria.
No, not that.
You see, those twinkling things that look like clouds or something.
Oh, I see, they are called "fireflies of space".
Fireflies of space...
Yes.
Fireflies of space...
Fireflies of space...
I've never seen them before. I didn't know there were fireflies in space.
How romantic!
Their name might sound romantic, but they are actually just radioactive dust particles.
So it's a famous characteristic of the asteroid belt but the belt itself is made out of nuclear waste, kind of like a glowing garbage dump.
Pilot! What's going on?
I'm sorry, but some stellar hot-rodders have disrupted our flight path.
Whatl?
What are they thinking? What if we collided?
Call the space patrol and have them arrested.
Yes, sir!
How cool!
Yahoo!
Hey Captain, hurry up and follow them.
But wait miss. Here, please have a seat.
Forget you, I'll be the driver!
No way!
Let me go.
Ifl let you drive then I would be fired.
Please!
No!
If you don't hurry we'll lose them!
Let go of me!
Hey Shiro, this is so much fun!
I'm glad we left earth to come fly around.
Yeah, do you want to bet?
What do you want to bet?
How about a gold coin?
Do you even have a gold coin?
D0 you?
Uh-Oh
Oh, no, it's a cop!
Warning! Breaking the space traffic law costs you more than just fines!
Do you understand?
Screw that! I'm not following the law!
Hey, if you don't like what I do, then I dare you to "Chicken Run"
Chicken run? What the heck is that?
Cops around here don't even know "Chicken Run"!?
Fly straight towards the ground and whoever pulls up the farthest from the ground is the "Chicken".
Lefs go!
Oh my god!
Hold on!
Of course!
Here we go!
Going through the tunnel next!
All right! Bring it on!
Thafs what you get!
Oh, no!
Hey I won! Don't forget about the gold coin.
Shoot, this was our first flight in this ship and now we've crashed.
Stupid engine!
What is this'?
Aaron, I found one in my engine compartment, too.
Milazeria Command Center
Salute!
This is so stupid!
I don't get the point of this.
Our commander must have gone crazy.
If earthlings find out about this, we'll be in trouble.
Good-bye, Beba, my old friend.
Rest in peace.
This is Gulda. What is it?
Emergency call from the command center.
Gulda! What was just launched? What was it for?
It was a funeral.
A funeral?
To remember a soldier we once had, I ordered it.
What? Who are you talking about?
Beba the 1st... my robot.
A robot?
You wasted one of our important rockets on a robot?
Yes, he was a robot but also my friend for thirty years.
I could not stand to see him reduced to scrap.
You idiot!
Have you gone mad, Gulda?
You're fired, leave here right now!
I would be happy to.
I have no regrets leaving such a corrupt military.
Good-bye, general.
Beba #2, are you ready?
Yes, master. I found these at a secondhand store.
I see, at a secondhand store.
This will do.
A perfect outfit for a man who no longer has any attachment to the military.
Don't you think, Beba #2?
I don't keep up with fashion trends!
Hey bartender, give me another one.
Yes, right away.
Oh, master, please do not drink too much.
We still have to find a place to stay tonight.
Ah, Beba #2, don't worry so much or else...
I'll send you off in a rocket.
You can't do that to me!
OK, OK, just one more Beba, just one more.
Huh?
Hey, what is this?
Did you put this in my drink?
What? No.
I wonder what kind of seed it is.
This is very peculiar.
This Milazarian drink tastes just like scotch.
It's because you drank too much and can't taste anymore.
Don't talk to me like your my wife.
Ah! Damn it!
Hey, Jack! Jack!
Yes, yes, yes.
You remember that money I had you put away? Bring it here!
Yes, sir! Uh, well...
I need cash right this minute, hurry up and bring it!
Well, I...
What are you waiting forl?
I'm so sorry!
Ouch, ouch, please forgive me!
Are these guys the ones you loaned that money to?
Yes, yes, yes!
You punks!
The money you borrowed from this guy belonged to me.
This idiot tried to make extra money off of it by charging interest. You understand?
Yeah, I understand.
If you understand, then bring all the money back to me in thirty minutes.
If you are late even a minute, or a second, I will sink all of you in quicksand!
Hey, you heard him, hurry up and give me back that money! Hurry!
This is too sudden.
You said we could pay you back little by little by working part time!
Well, just give me what you have and
I will come up with the rest somehow.
We used it all to buy a new machine.
Whatl?
Upgrading the machine was expensive.
We had to order the parts from Earth.
You idiots!
We're all going to be sent to the quicksand!
What have you done!
What the heck is this? This is a huge seed to come out of a tomato.
Aaron.
Yeah, it is the same thing that we found.
Hey! Aaron! Shiro!
Mayan!
I was looking all over for you guys.
What are you doing here?
I was on a star cruiser and I played a joke on the pilot.
He panicked and crashed the ship.
That's why you are here?
Well, yes, they told me I had to get out of the cruiser for a while until they could repair it.
Hey, who is this chick?
She's our friend from pilot school on Earth.
Oh, yeah, Mayah, yourfamily is wealthy, aren't they?
Well, yes.
Great! Would you loan us a little money for a while?
Wh at fo r?
We borrowed thirty gold coins from a gangster to build a new machine.
Now they say we have to pay them back right away, otherwise they would kill us.
Thirty gold coins?
Yes.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait! There is only one condition.
You have to help me catch space fireflies.
Space fireflies?
Yes, on my way here, I saw space fireflies outside the window of the ship.
I want them.
Oh, no, we can't. We're not allowed to be out there.
If we get caught, we'll go to jail for at least three years.
Fine. If you don't want to help me, I won't lend you the money.
Well, then we will do it!
I'm not going to let those gangsters kill us over a little bit of money.
Me, too. I will do whatever you want me to.
I'm telling you, we're not supposed to go out there!
Damn it! I'm not letting them get away this time!
There they are.
This is officer Fox, I have found the hot-rodders near the asteroid belt.
I'm going to arrest them!
Stupid cop!
Lefs go!
Damn! Do they think this is some kind ofjoke?
If we get caught, we'll be in jail for 3 years!
I don't think so! I'm a good enough pilot to avoid the police!
In fact, I'm pretty good. I was well known as "Kamikaze Mayah" back on Earth.
Here we are. Lefs go Jack.
Oh, please. Please don't make me do this.
You can stay here if you want to. But I heard there are space monsters around here and they would come and eat you.
Whatl? No way, please wait for me.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Here we come.
This is not good.
I can't believe these guys.
Hey Mayah, it's networking.
They die as soon as I catch them.
You have to catch them alive!
If you don't then
I'm not going to lend you the money.
Okay, okay. We'll try.
Hey, look at that!
What is it'?
I wonder what it is.
Lefs go check it out.
Okay. Yo, Mayah, lefs go!
Hey, what is that?
Shut up, we'll see.
Is anybody here?
This is a ghost ship.
Lefs go see the inside.
Are you sure it's okay?
You chicken! If you're so scared then go back and wait in the ship.
What is it'?
Somebody's on the floor!
Are they dead?
Wow... She's beautiful.
I wonder what happened to them.
They must have been attacked by space monsters.
I don't like this at all. We probably should go back.
Wow, this engine's not from our Solar system.
Wh at?
Are you sure about that?
Yeah. I know everything there is to know about these machines.
They use this sail to convert light into energy.
That means these people could be from a different Galaxy.
Possibly.
What the heck is that?
What kind of ship is that?
They are alive!
Who are you people?
Princess Emerarida!
Hurry, this way!
Hurry UP!
Come on!
Oh, man, ifs crazy out there.
Of course it is. Their shipjust got blown up.
Should we call the police?
You crazy fool! Then they would know that we were in a prohibited area.
We would go to jail for three years. JAIL!
I'm so sorry.
We caused you trouble.
Oh, yeah, we almost got killed because of you.
You caused us a lot of trouble!
Jack!
Shut up! What do chicks know?
What's going on? It's noisy out there.
Shhhh, The owner of this place is back.
They are arguing about something.
Anyway, I'm not going to let this go.
You will have to pay for this.
Pay What?
Money, you know, MONEY!
Stop it, Jack. How embarrassing.
Just shut up and stay out of this, lady!
You be quiet!
Don't pick on herjust because she's a woman.
What? What did you just say to me?
Ow, ow, ow!
Go, lady!
Shhhh.
You hit mel? How dare youl? Come on, you guys!
Go get him!
Come on, guys, just kill them!
As you wish.
Urocco, wait!
Please let me. They're bad men.
No, they're not.
They are the brave warriors of Reyabe.
Wh at?
Please forgive us.
Does it hurt?
Please take this.
No way.
The brave warriors of Reyabe must be sophisticated and noble.
Such foolish and cowardly men could never be them.
Don't you have any faith?
These holy Reyabe seeds have sought out these people.
Who are you?
Excuse me, but I was tired so I stopped to rest here.
I'm harmless.
I could not help but over hear your conversation. I also have this seed.
I assume there is a story behind this.
Would you please explain it to us?
Yes, I will.
Everyone, please listen to me.
We, the people of Jilutia were living peacefully until the Gabanas Empire attacked our planet.
When I close my eyes I can still see the men, the women, the elderly and even small children fighting, bleeding, then finally dying.
When we could no longer fight against
Gabanas we prayed to our God for a miracle.
Our God then answered by giving these sacred Reyabe seeds the power to seek out eight brave warriors.
When these eight warriors are brought to Jilutia the miracle will occur, destroying the evil Gabanas Empire.
The prophecy will then be fulfilled.
I see. Nowl know the story.
But look at all of us.
I have experience in fighting wars, but do you even know how to use weapons?
Of course not. The last battle between planets ended the year I was born.
Right, Shiro?
Yeah, I don't even want to go to war.
How about you, tough guy? What do you think?
What do I think'?
Well, there will be only eight of us...
You would be better off to ask for help from Earths higher ranks.
What do you think?
You need young people in order to fight a war.
And if the young people are anything like them, then it would be hopeless.
Even if I try to fight for you I cannot do it alone.
I shouldn't keep this.
Beba, lefs go.
What is it'?
Look at that, master. Beba the
1st became a star and is in orbit.
It's over now. Lefs forget about it.
No, I cannot.
I will never forget your incredible kindness towards robots.
You are making me sober up. Here, lefs go. Hurry.
Master, why don't you help those people?
I'm sure Beba the 1st is wondering the same thing up in the sky.
Beba, I already left the military.
I cut all ties. I don't want to do anything anymore.
Lefs stop arguing and go find a place to sleep.
Princess Emerarida, let's leave here to find the rest of those four brave warriors.
There must be real brave warriors of
Reyabe somewhere who would fight for us.
Yes, you are right.
Wait. Please don't go yet.
Aren't you guys real men? Don't you want to help them?
Shut up! We were just discussing how we can help.
Okay, guys, you understand?
Well, but...
No "buts" Think about it, if we lose this chance, we'll be sent to die in the quicksand. I'm going.
Okay, I will at least show you where the rest of them are.
What? You mean you know other people who posses Reyabe seeds?
Well, yeah. They are not like us but hunters who hunt Milazerian wolves.
They would be perfect for fighting against the Gabanas Empire.
Jack, I'm so proud of you!
Oh, yes, I have seen this before.
Some guys who came to buy liquor from me wore the same seed as a good luck charm.
What? ls that true?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
They were very unusual seeds and I got a close look at them.
I remember this very well.
Princess Emerarida, this is good news.
Yes, lefs go find them.
You can't go, miss.
It's too dangerous for you.
They are on the move year round tracking the Milazerian wolves.
You cannot travel by jeep to find them. It's not that easy.
Do you have any idea where to find them?
Well, of course it would be somewhere you can hear the wolves howling.
Take us there, will you?
Right now?
Yeah, we will pay you.
It's already dark outside. Why don't we wait until tomorrow morning?
No, no, that won't work. We just heard wolves howling near here.
If we wait until morning and the wolves move on, then they would move on, too. They're in a hurry.
Please.
It's still too dangerous for a woman.
The mountain roads around here are very rough.
I will go by myself.
Please wait here, princess Emerarida.
If you really want to go now...
Hikiroku!
Come down here.
Would you take them up the mountain?
Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
No problem. When we need help, we need to help each other.
It's cold at night in the mountains, so drink this before you go.
Thank you so much for everything.
Urocco... please be careful.
IWill.
Don't worry. My son is a very experienced guide.
You tricked us!
Of course I did. I got that old hag to slip a drug in your drink. Now die!
Huh! What took you so long? Here, pay up.
Well done, son. It must have been cold outside.
Come over here and have a drink.
What happened to Urocco?
He won't be coming back.
Here, don'tjust stand there.
Go sit by Hikiroku and pour him a drink.
Are you deaf?
What are you doing to me?
What am I doing? I paid a lot of money to make you Hikiroku's wife.
Wh at?
No!
What is that look for?
How dare you be so rude just because of how he looks.
This is my son that I gave birth to on Pluto.
Hikiroku, hurry up and make her yours.
Damn you! You just won't listen.
Teach her a lesson.
You killed my son!
Take her away!
Yes, sir!
Here, take this old woman, too.
Yes, sir!
Princess Emerarida!
Princess Emerarida!
Princess Emerarida!
Princess Emerarida!
Jack, how does it feel to do something nice for a change?
It feels great!
Were they happy to find the brave warriors of Reyabe?
Of course.
So what happened? What did they do?
They went to kick some ass. A big space ship came to pick them up.
And you guys are still here?
So what.
That's a shame. You guys are also brave warriors of Reyabe.
I know, I know.
You don't know anything.
Why don't you go help them?
Go where?
To Jilutia, in the Andromeda nebula, of course.
How do we get there without a spaceship?
It's two million light years away. We can't even go one.
Why don't you build one then? I will pay for it!
Oh, I have a great idea. You could upgrade my spaceship and attach both of yours to each side.
They could detach in an emergency. We can build the most awesome machine together!
That is a great idea! I always wanted to build something like that.
What, are you stupid? Don'tjump on it so easily.
What's wrong with you, Aaron.
You're acting kind of strange.
It's okay, ifs okay. Here, lefs dance.
Urocco!
I'm not going to forgive you! I'm going to kill you!
Shame on you, Jack.
Ha! I wasn't the only one.
They made some money, too.
We knew you would just complain if you found out.
What?
Is that true?
Tell me the truth, Aaron!
Shiro, is that true?
Do you believe their story, Mayah?
That these seeds have the divine power to seek us out from across the universe?
Hey lady, don't look so sad.
Even if the story is true, it's two million light years away.
We can't really do anything for them anyway, no matter how much we care.
You jerks!
Sorry we're such jerks.
I'm not like you,
I hate war and heroes, I'm just a punk.
My father died during war while your father profited from it.
And you're his little princess.
Aaron...
But it doesn't matter. I hate it when people order me around.
You can't make me do anything either.
Stupid seed!
What are you doingl?
You should throw yours away, too, Shiro.
I hate you all!
Emerarida!
Where did you go?
Emerarida!
Do you know where Emerarida is?
Hey! What are you doing to me?
Emerarida! EMERARIDA!
It's too late!
She's going to die now.
Or do you want to die, instead?
NO! I'm an Earthling.
I have no relation to you or to her.
You liar.
You're in love with her.
No, I don't love her.
Ifl did, I wouldn't have sold her out!
But you did.
For a little bit of money, you sold her.
Now look what you've done.
Nooooo!
Hey kid, what's wrong?
What happened?
Oh, no. We have nothing to do with this kid.
Please help us. Help!
You cowards! You weaklings!
Jilutia, forever!
Whafs wrong?
No... nothing.
This is a Reyabe seed.
I wonder why this came back.
I don't know.
I don't know, but... What am I feeling?
Look...the Reyabe seed found me, too.
Where's yours, Aaron?
Aaron, you...
Don't worry, yours will come back soon.
It has to. All of ours came back.
Shut up! I'm not a little kid.
Forget those stupid things.
Just be quiet. I can't sleep.
Master!
Their battleship has just returned.
Well, well, well. Welcome. I always wanted to have a chance to speak with you.
I don't have anything to discuss with you people.
You Gabanasian people tore apart our peaceful planet with your evil claws, took our Southern winds and Sunlight away from us, and turned our planet into a cold, dark place.
But that was not my intention.
You must know that I wanted to leave Jilutia as beautiful as it was.
Jilutia became that way only because your people Kept fighting us even though there was no chance for them.
Are you suggesting that we forget about our pride and start living like prisoners?
If so, then every last one of us would rather fight and die until the very end.
Nobody in the universe can take
Jilutia's dream away from us.
Take her away.
Yes, sir.
Are you keeping her alive?
She might still be useful to us...
Excuse me, my lord.
What is it'?
We brought you another souvenir.
This is an intelligent life form from elsewhere in the solar system.
I thought we might be able to extract information from it.
Wh at?
Are you saying there are other civilizations in the Solar system?
Yes. Please look at this.
I believe these are its childhood memories.
I'm so tired.
I feel like I've traveled from one end of the universe to the other for hundreds of years.
I'm really tired.
I want to go home. I want to go home to Earth.
What happened?
Show me more.
Yes, but I'm afraid it's injured and if we continue this it will die.
I don't care.
Yes, sir.
It's beautiful.
I've never seen a planet as beautiful as this.
What's the name of this planet?
Yes, it is called “Earth”, the third planet of the solar system.
Earth...
Yes.
Its life has just ended.
Mother.
Don't you think Earth would be a perfect planet for us to build our Kingdom from which to conquer the universe?
Ithink so.
If we succeed, you will be the biggest king in all of history.
But I still worry about whatever became of those Reyabe seeds.
Don't you worry about it, mother.
It's already taken care of.
Well, then, you must act quickly and give the order to invade Earth.
As long as we have this big planet for our for-tress, we needn't worry no matter what the Earthling defenses are.
Master! The sky! The sky is moving!
No, it's not the sky.
It's our planet Jilutia that has started moving.
Right after that, a military observatory on Earth detected a mysterious planet rapidly heading towards them from the Andromeda nebula.
They then received a message from Roxaiah the 12th demanding them to surrender.
But the Nations of Earth refused to meet his demands and launched
3 of their battle ships to intercept the Gabanas attack.
Launch fighters!
Launch!
Fire ultra nuclear missile!
Firing missile!
Fine.
I order all of you to prepare for battle.
The government leaders of Earth were shocked by the fact that all three battleships were destroyed during the attack.
They felt responsible for the loss and all agreed to resign from their positions.
The opposition party of Earth established a new council of delegates to replace the former officials, and Ernest Noguchi became the council's leader.
Where is he?
We looked everywhere for him and finally found him. But he seems to be very intoxicated.
General Gulda. Long time no see.
Noguchi! Oh, excuse me, President Noguchi.
Congratulations on your recent promotion.
I'm so proud that one of my childhood friends has become a leader of the planet.
It's very ironic that my council was established due to the Gabanas attack, yet at the same time we are in danger because of it.
So much responsibility you have.
But the Eartns future or politics has nothing to do with me any more.
Well, listen to me.
I will do anything to overcome this danger.
What do you think, would you attack Gabanas
Empire as my ambassador extraordinaire.
An ambassador extraordinaire.
Me?
They are demanding our unconditional surrender, and require that we answer within three days.
I want you to extend it as long as you can.
I see.
You need extra time to get ready for the attack.
By the way, why did you pick me for such an important task?
Do you remember the nickname
I gave you when we were little?
Yes, I do.
Don Quixote.
That nickname is why I appointed you.
There is no one else who can fight against a giant enemy with nothing but a spear.
No, that's not true.
Even ifl can buy us some time, there is no way you can win against them.
Do you even know the condition of our military right now?
Generals are into politics, and soldiers are used to living peacefully.
It shoudn't even be called a military.
That was why I left. I can't help you.
Don't you want to save the Earth, and our peoplel?
How dare you forget your pride as a great general!
I'm no longer a general.
I gave up on myself. I died.
Beba the 1st is in the sky...
And so am I.
Holy seed... you really want me to...
What is wrong Gulda?
You wouldn't believe this story.
My dream...
It's just come back to me.
Beba!
Yes, master!
Get ready.
We're leaving to the Gabanas Empire as an ambassador extraordinaire.
Yes, sir!
Mayah, I wonder why the Reyabe seed hasn't come back to him yet.
It doesn't want to come back if he is acting that way.
He's such a sissy.
Urocco!
What are you doing? I told you to stay in bed.
No, I can't.
I have to find all eight brave warriors of Reyabe, otherwise we can't destroy the Gabanas Empire.
I must go and find them.
What can you do injured?
We already have so much to worry about, please don't give us more.
Hey there!
Well, it's amazing. A drunken soldier told me that the story about Jilutia is really true.
A great man from the Earth came to tell them that they are going to Jilutia.
Wow. We have to hurry and finish building our ship so that we can go, too!
Hey! Shiro!
Where are you going?
Aaron, please.
Think it over again and help us.
Shut up.
Why don't you think it over?
Do you still believe in a fairy tail?
Do you think a man like you can be a hero?
Aaron... I understand how you feel.
You like Emerarida, don't you?
What the heck are you talking about?
I don't have time for these childish games.
I'm going to take a nap.
Why don't you get out of here.
You are in so much denial, Aaron.
Piss off!
Screw you!
Shiro!
Hey you guys, stop m
Aaron, Shiro, please stop!
This is no time to fight against each other.
Shiro!
Hey, stop!
It's Gabanas! Run!
Oh my god!
Ahhhh! Help me, please!
Jack!
Aaron! It's too dangerous to go by yourself!
You Idiot! They captured Jack!
We have to do something.
If you go by yourself, you will just get killed.
Shut up! Don't worry about me!
Get out of my way!
Aaron, Aaron, look at this!
It came back!
See, your Reyabe seed came back to you, too.
This must be a sign that we all have to work together.
Now Aaron, lefs go build that ship.
We'll arrive at Jilutia in twenty minutes.
We should each get in position now.
Yeah.
Okay.
Aaron, Shiro, get ready to detach.
All right!
I'm ready when you are!
Oh, no!
Whafs going on?
I'm losing control!
I wonder where we are.
According to my calculations, we're on a small planet in the Bernard system.
Damn it! Why would the Reyabe seed cause us to crash here?
Damn!
You're right. If we would have kept going, we could have rescued Jack by now.
Hey, did you hear that noise?
What is that?
It's a Gabanasian!
Wh at?
Watch out!
Urocco!
How rude!
You just start attacking me without first introducing yourself. Are you a thief? Orjust plain crazy?
I will kill you in honor ofJilutial
Wait, look! He's a brave warrior of Reyabe, too!
My name is Hans. I'm originally a prince of the Gabanas Empire.
My mother and father were killed by the evil Roxaiah.
And I came to live here.
I've been waiting for a chance to seek my revenge.
It's my destiny to follow this Reyabe seed.
I would be happy to fight along side of you.
But that would mean you are going to be fighting against your own people.
Are you okay with that?
I will fight against my own people in order to bring justice to the universe.
I will have no regrets.
Now it all make sense.
The Reyabe seed caused us to crash here so that we would find prince Hans.
Yes, I think so, too. Lefs go to Jilutia.
Earth...
You disturb my mind and drive me crazy.
Vvny?
Is it because you are so beautiful?
Tomorrow is the third day.
But the Earthlings have said nothing to us.
What are you going to do?
Don't worry, mother.
I don't think the Earthlings have enough courage to save the planet.
Your majesty.
An Earthlings' spaceship is getting closer. They are requesting a meeting.
Finally.
Give them permission to land.
Emperor Roxaiah, grand empress Dark,
I'm honored to meet you.
You have come a long way. Make yourself at home.
We have a gift for you.
Here.
Yes, sir.
Enter!
Damn you! You're going to kill me, aren't you?
Do it! Kill me now! I'm also a brave warrior of Reyabe, I'm not afraid to die!
General!
I'm going to die! Help me!
You laugh at us.
You! What's so funny?
You ridicule my people.
This is unacceptable. I can't forgive such an insult.
I challenge you right now!
Let us fight!
Wait. General Gulda.
You're here as an ambassador of the Earths government.
How rude of you to start a personal fight in front of me.
I don't think it's rude at all.
On Earth when a person is insulted he has a right to redeem himself.
Of course he can refuse to fight, but then he will be known as a coward.
All right then. I will allow you to fight.
Lazzar! Fight!
Yes, your majesty.
You have only one shot each.
Both of you take 10 paces, then turn and fire.
Begin!
He cheated!
Beba. Stay out of this.
Nine... ten.
You're a disgrace to the Gabanas
Empire. Dispose of him immediately!
Pardon me emperor, butjust as you
Gabanasians value your reputation, there are also people on Earth who value their reputation more than their own lives.
For those people, your request for them to surrender is equally disgraceful.
Just lil<e on Jilutia where they keep fighting Knowing there's no chance for them, this blue Earth will be turned into a planet of death.
If there is a chance for me to persuade the people of Earth not to fight and die so senselessly, would you allow me a little more time?
You want more time to prepare for the battle don't you?
Well done.
I almost fell for your trick.
You're right, Earth is too beautiful to be destroyed.
But, how about that little star you call "the moon"?
Listen, you have until tomorrow to surrender.
If you don't, the same thing will happen to your precious Earth.
Leave now!
He's one of the brave warriors of Reyabe.
Are you sure it's wise to let him go?
Beba.
Yes, master.
We are going back to Jilutia.
What? But why?
We are going to defeat the Gabanas Empire.
Roger.
General Gulda.
What are you doing?
Tell the president that Don Quixote has returned.
"Don Quixote has returned?"
He will understand what I mean.
Now we shall go to face the giant.
Lefs go, Sancho Panza. Don't fall on top of me.
Okay, lefs go.
Yes master!
If you're scared, you don't have to come. See you later!
Oh... shoot, I'm a brave warrior of
Reyabe, too! Hurry, help me put this on!
If we fly straight ahead, their radar will detect us.
Do you have any ideas?
Don't worry. We planned ahead. Right?
Yeah. Okay.
This is Shiro, I'm ready.
Yeah, me, too!
Okay, commence operation "Chicken Run" Go!
We have an intruder in sector three!
Wh at?
Red alert!
Stand by to detach!
Fire!
They hit the ground. It could have possibly been a meteorite.
Aaron, Shiro, prepare to reattach.
Reattachment complete!
Lefs land, Mayah.
Urocco, here we are.
Yes.
Is anybody there? ls anybody there?
This is Urocco. I have brought with me four of the brave warriors of Reyabe!
He)' YOU guys! lt's me! lt's me!
It's Jack!
Jack!
General!
I knew you would come.
Who is this?
Prince Hans. He too is one of the brave warriors of Reyabe.
I see. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Now we have Six Don Quixotes. Right, Beba?
Just two more to go.
By the way, too bad I'm only a robot.
Don't say that. Come on, lefs go.
Please look at this.
This is the central reactor core that powers the whole planet.
And blowing up this reactor is the only way to destroy the Gabanas fortress.
Since it's their only weakness it's very heavily guarded.
Our military has tried to destroy it several times before, but every previous attempt has failed.
But if you blow up the reactor core, it would destroy not only Gabanas but also Jilutia itself.
Yes, I am aware.
But I'm still asking you.
Please blow up this reactor core!
Master! That's crazy.
Urocco. Please understand.
Our mother planet should be put to rest by our own hand.
It's the least we can do.
We decided while you were gone.
Is this true?
Is this true?
How could you!
Urocco!
What are you going to do?
There's an old spaceship over in the swamp.
Its engine should still work.
We can at least save the women and children.
Well, then, our only concern now is how to go about exploding the reactor core.
This spiral pipe is connected to the core but its diameter is only ten meters.
So, how will we get there?
The entrance from outside is much too heavily guarded.
To gain entry by that route is hopeless.
Hey, he says its diameter is ten meters.
Yeah, we might be able to make it.
You're right.
What are you going to do?
We're just going to fly our ship right through the pipe.
The Gabanasians wouldn't even think about a small ship flying inside of the fortress.
It's too dangerous. The pipe is too narrow.
If you make even one small mistake, you will die.
Ha! We're not your standard military pilots.
Thafs right, we flew through narrow tunnels back on Earth all the time.
There's no other way, is there? Just leave it to us.
It might be the reason why the Reyabe seeds chose you.
Okay, it's worth a try. Study this map of the fortress interior and memorize its structural attributes.
What is that?
It's a Reyabe seed! Yay! Hooray!
What happened?
Please look at this.
It came to me, too. A Reyabe seed!
Oh, Beba! You're the seventh one!
Then the eighth one is... I wonder...
Drop your weapons!
Nobody move!
Drop the weapons. Everyone, drop the weapons.
Grandfather!
Emerarida!
Everyone, listen.
I knew about everything.
General Gulda, Prince l-lans, and those silly young fellows all posses the Reyabe seeds and would come before me.
You wonder why?
Well, there's a traitor amongst you.
You poor old man.
All of your soldiers have been captured by my army, and the miracle of Reyabe shall never occur.
I'll give you one last chance to end your hopeless fight.
If you surrender, I will guarantee the safety of you and your people.
It's true that your Gabanas Empire has defeated us.
But you can never take away our dreams!
I believe that as long as our dreams are kept alive the miracle of Reyabe will still occur, destroying Gabanas Empire once and for all!
You fool. You speak of a dream that can never come true.
Now you must die, by the hand of one of your own. Urocco!
Urocco! Why?
Don't look at me like that!
This was a hopeless war from the very beginning.
All we could do was to believe in some miracle!
And now you are about to destroy our own planet.
Without this land, there is no freedom or pride!
How many people have already died for this planet?
Iam... lam...
Urocco!
Mr. Urocco. This seed came to find a lowly robot such as me.
You know in your heart what you are doing is wrong.
Urocco! What are you waiting for?
I gave you a direct order.
Shoot. Betraying my master means betraying my own beliefs.
Roxaiah!
Shiro, over there! Over there!
Damn!
Beba, stay back. Hurry!
Urocco! Urocco! Urocco!
Look, Urocco, you're the eighth brave warrior of Reyabe.
Now all eight brave warriors of Reyabe have finally gathered. The miracle must occur.
Urocco!
Master!
We'll hold them off here. Please hurry and get the rest of them safely to the ship.
Quick, now's your chance!
All right!
Prince Hans, cover them!
Hey. What should I do?
I'll protect you.
Are you okay?
Yes. I don't feel pain.
You go ahead!
NOW!
Damn!
It's too bright and I can't see anything! Get rid of that light!
Leave it to me!
Okay, Lefs go!
Aaron, Shiro, are you ready for your ships to detach?
Standing by!
Yeah, go ahead!
Go!
Here they come!
Yahoo!
Aaron, Shiro, hang in there!
Onward! Onward!
Someone, hurry and start the engine!
Everyone, hurry up and get on board!
To the ship! Hurry!
Oh, no! Quick! Let me help you. Hurry up!
Please help me quickly.
Iam! Hurry, this way!
You have arrived Prince Hans.
Roxaiah, you bastard.
You not only killed my mother and father in order to steal the crown, but you also invaded the whole universe and turned it into a desolate place.
Your crimes deserve to be punished with death. Die!
Aaron, look at that!
There it is! Lefs go!
Shiro, We have to lose them!
Okay!
We did it!
That will teach you!
Everyone, please don't panic!
Help the children, quick!
It's going to explode! The planet is going to explode! Hurry!
Are you all right? Hurry, get on the ship!
Everyone, hurry!
Princess Emerarida! Our master is still down there!
Grandfather!
Emerarida, don't cry over my death.
The planet of Jilutia is my home.
L'll be turned to dust along with my own planet.
The young people must follow the
Reyabe seeds and start a new life.
Go and find a new land far away in the universe and grow your roots there.
Build a new kingdom, which will be filled with life, happiness and peace once again.
Good-bye!
Grandfather!
A battleship!
What are we going to do?
Well, one last chicken run!
Here, trade seats with me, Mayah.
Lefs go!
Everyone, hurry!
ONE!
TWO!
THREE!
Oh, they're awake.
Wow. We're alive.
Yes. The miracle of Reyabe has come true.
Thanks to you our people are safe.
I can't express enough gratitude.
We did it!
This is general Gulda. The Gabanas
Empire has been destroyed.
General Gulda. Thank you.
Myself, on behalf of the people of the Earth, appreciate all that you and your brave soldiers have done.
Please come home to Earth. We are also ready to welcome the people of Jilutia.
I deeply appreciate your concern.
But now we must leave to find a new home, to build a new kingdom.
It's all we can do to honor my grandfather and the others who have fought and died for Jilutia.
Emerarida, may I come with you?
In order to make amends for what my people have done,
I would be honored to assist you with building a new life for your people.
Please do.
Can I go with you?
Yeah, me, too!
Me, too!
But why would you want to come?
I'm beginning to understand our purpose in life.
How about you, Aaron?
Uh, well, I...
Even if we go back to Earth, we're just going to be chased by the cops. Right?
Yes, yes, I'm coming, too!
But I wonder if people like us can build a whole kingdom.
Of course you can. You're all brave warriors of Reyabe.
Yay!
Did you hear that?
To sow the seeds of new life far across the universe we're going to leave Earth.
Good-bye, Nogchi, my friend.
But it's too bad.
If we went back to Earth, even I might have been able to receive a medal.
The universe is infinite Beba.
We as individuals are so small compared to it, but at least our dreams can also be infinite.
Let us depart.
Onward!
Starboard!

THE END
How are you today? Hm?
You feeling good? Oh.
I bet you'd like something to eat.
Here. I've got something in my pocket here.
Some goodies. I'll set the table for you here, OK?
That's good.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Do I have to put signs up here to keep you guys off my grass?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Hey! Get out of the way! Ya-hoo!
Whoo!
What do you think you're doing?
Ah-ha!
Whoo!
Look out!
Whoo!
Did you see the way that Lowell threw that rake at me?
- Why don't you lay off Lowell for a bit?
- We're just having a little fun.
Oh, yeah! Now what is this?
Really nice catch.
You guys are outrageous.
Listen, Wolfie, we've been here for six months.
We got six months more to go.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
He told me a story this morning about how they're gonna refoliate the earth.
Again?!
Let's set this thing up the way it was before, huh?
Oh!
It missed. It failed.
First time!
Let's stop playing with this thing, OK?
OK.
I'll tell you this for old flower-face, he sure knows how to play this thing.
Plenty of time to practise.
Hey, Lowell!
- How about a little of the old poker?
- Yeah. Later.
On this first day of a new century,...
.. we humbly beg forgiveness...
..and dedicate these last forests...
..of our once beautiful nation,...
..in the hope that they will one day return...
..and grace our foul earth.
Until that day,...
..may God bless these gardens...
..and the brave men who care for them.
- Three.
- Three.
Dealer takes one.
The deck's still open. Your bet, Barker.
And 100.
Guts.
Come on, son. Throw it on in.
I fold.
You bet $50 and then you're folding?
Right.
Well, boys, there's a three.
And there's another three.
And there are three big bullets.
I will just reach in and gather up the telepors.
- Beats me.
- You bet it does.
I wish they'd hurry up with that transmission. I wanna go to bed.
I suggest that you reach deep down inside yourself...
..and try and find something to keep you awake a little longer,...
..because this transmission coming up may just rekindle your will to live.
You think it'll be a recall?
Let's just say that
I feel my communications...
..may finally bear some fruit.
Mm. Cantaloupes, maybe.
I'll let that witticism slide by,...
..because it's my feeling that they're about to re-establish...
..the parks and forests system.
- With you as director?
- You can think of anybody better?
More qualified? Huh?
- Really, it's...
- No, wait a second.
Let me just ask him a question here.
I've spent my last eight years up here, dedicated to this project.
Now, can you think of anybody more qualified?
It's more likely that they're gonna announce cutbacks.
Sorry. There's no way they'll announce cutbacks, not after this amount of time.
Hey, Lowell, you're dreaming.
And you don't think it's time somebody had a dream again, huh?
You don't think that it's time that somebody cared enough to have a dream?
What about the forests? You don't think anyone should care about them?
What's gonna happen if these forests and all this incredible beauty is lost for ever?
It's been too long, Lowell.
People have got other things to do now.
Hi, this is for Valley Forge,
Berkshire, Sequoia.
This is Com Central. Channel open for executive order AUC3423.
Listen to this, boys.
This is Anderson speaking.
Boys, I have to make an announcement.
We have just received orders to abandon...
..and nuclear-destruct all the forests...
..and return our ships to commercial service.
I received no explanation...
..and we must begin at 0900 in the morning.
May God have mercy on us all.
- This is it! We're goin' home!
- I can't believe it!
- I told you! What'd I say?
- We pack up those domes and go home.
Destruct all forest units.
Kiss 'em goodbye, boys.
Hey, Lowell, I'm sorry.
It makes sense, you know?
It's insane.
Let's go.
Heels of children running wild
In the sun
Like a forest is your child
Growing wild
In the sun
Doomed in his innocence
In the sun
Gather your children to your side
In the sun
Tell them all they love will die
Tell them why
In the sun
Tell them it's not too late
Cultivate, one by one
Tell them to harvest
And rejoice
In the sun
How far out do they go before they blow?
About six miles.
We should feel a hefty jolt.
- I want a front-row seat when they go!
- I'll bet you do.
Lowell, do you have to eat that stuff in here? It stinks.
You never let up, do you?
Oh.
Now you hurt his feelings.
I'd like to know what any one of you knows about real food.
What do you mean, real food?
Out of the dirt? That's real food?
That's right. This happens to be nature's greatest gift.
To a celibate, maybe.
Come on, you guys.
Maybe he knows something we don't.
Lowell, give me a slice of that cantaloupe.
Don't ask Lowell for a slice.
I'd be delighted to give you a slice of it.
Just sit down and shut up.
Sit down. Sit down!
And shut up and leave me alone, all of you, and let me eat.
What's the big deal? I can't see the difference between that and this.
You don't see the difference?
The difference is that I grew it.
That's what the difference is.
I picked it and I fixed it.
And it has a taste, and it has some colour and it has a smell.
It calls back a time when there were flowers all over the earth.
There were valleys, and there were plains of tall green grass...
..that you could lie down in, that you could go to sleep in.
There were blue skies and there was fresh air.
There were things growing everywhere, not just in domes...
..blasted millions of miles out into space.
Look at that stuff. How can you guys sit there and say anything to me about this?
Look at this crap! Look at that!
Dried, synthetic crap!
You've become so dependent on it,
I bet you can't even live without it.
Why would we want to, Lowell?
Don't you realise how pitiful that is, what you just asked me?
On earth, everywhere you go, the temperature is 75º.
Everything is the same.
All the people are exactly the same.
Now, what kind of life is that?
- So why do you wanna go back?
- Because it's not too late to change it.
What do you want, Lowell?
There's hardly any more disease.
There's no more poverty.
Nobody's out of a job.
That's right. Every time we have the argument, you say the same thing.
You give me the same three answers.
"Everybody has a job."
That's always the last one.
But you know what else there is no more of? There is no more beauty.
There's no more imagination and no frontiers left to conquer. You know why?
One reason why. The same attitude that you guys are givin' me in this room today.
And that is: nobody cares.
Look on the wall behind you.
Look at that little girl's face.
I know you've seen it.
But you know what she's never gonna be able to see?
She's never gonna be able to see the simple wonder of a leaf in her hand,...
..because there's not gonna be any trees.
Now, you think about that.
If people were interested, something would've been done a long time ago.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute. I don't think you guys understand what this means.
Please don't blow up the domes.
- Which one first?
- Outboard cluster first. Let's hit six.
- They're not disposable.
- I haven't got any choice, Lowell.
They're not replaceable.
Where's that tube?
- Ow! My hand.
- Hey, are you all right?
- You better get Lowell to fix that for you.
- Damn.
- Really.
- Yeah.
Will you help me?
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Get on in here now.
Valley Forge. Safe-distancing manoeuvre in five minutes.
Valley Forge, please stand by...
..for 1000 hours safe-distancing manoeuvre in five minutes.
I'm gonna need your help for that, you know, Lowell?
OK?
OK?
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Here.
Set gyro at 4406.
Set gyro to 4406.
This is Berkshire.
You there, Marty?
I'm on it, Neal.
OK, we're counting down for your 4406 distancing,...
..about 20 seconds.
- Set for distancing.
- Right.
Eight, seven, six, five...
..four, three, two, one. That's a go.
Thanks, Marty. We 're clear.
Stand by for updates.
Hey, Andy.
- The bomb, please.
- All right.
Loaded and ready to go.
99909 plus 49.
04 plus 8.
Right!
OK, looks real good. That's a go.
Hey, we're ready for some real fireworks here. 25 seconds.
We're looking forward to it, too, Neal.
Keep a steady hand, Marty.
Don't want one ofyou getting hurt.
Right. Will do.
Where the hell is Lowell now?
I think I saw him near One with some empty flowerpots.
That must be Berkshire.
Whoo!
- Do we need this?
- Huh?
Hey, Andy, easy with that.
No, we use the panel. It's safer.
- John, would you get those lights?
- Sure.
Nothin' up on the board.
- Well, set six.
- Gotcha.
- OK. Arm six.
- Armed.
Hit it.
No.
You're not comin' in here.
- What are you doin'?
- You're not comin' in here.
- Look, I know how you feel.
- If you knew how I felt,...
..you wouldn't be in here with that.
I'm on a tight schedule and I don't wanna fight.
I don't care. You are not using those things in my forest.
- I ain't got time to argue. Now, move!
- You're not gonna do it.
You can't blow up this forest.
Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge. Reading 4040.
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Come in,
Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
Reading 4040.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge.
Valley Forge to Berkshire.
You still there, Neal?
- Yes. Barker?
- No, it's Lowell.
Oh, what's the trouble, Lowell?
We seem to be experiencing some kind of problem with the main coupling.
Oh, might be one of your squib pins severing.
That's what we figured it was,...
..so we've gone ahead and we're setting it now.
We'll be getting back to you just as soon as we can.
Roger.
- Lowell.
- Yeah?
- Everything OK over there?
- Oh, yeah, OK.
A-OK. Everything's OK.
We 'll wait to hear, buddy.
Roger.
Drone one,...
..drone two, drone three,...
..please report immediately to the main cargo area.
-  Berkshire to Valley Forge.
- Yeah, yeah.
Come in, Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge.
Come in. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Valley Forge to Berkshire.
Come in, Berkshire.
- How's it goin', Lowell?
- It's not goin' too well, Neal.
We're gonna have to torch those pins.
Better move on it, buddy.
Darkness coming up on you, 33201.
- Right. We'll try our best.
- Boys here are getting anxious for home.
Yeah, I understand.
Coming into darkness at 33201.
Right.
Blow it any old way you can, Lowell.
Big Billy wants to go.
We're tryin'.
Yellowstone, Arcadia, Blue Ridge,
Mohave report finaljettisons.
We got a hold on Valley Forge.
Right.
Berkshire to Valley Forge. You're entering darkness. Lowell, do you read?
- Right, Neal. We hear ya.
- Big Billy says blow it anyway, Lowell.
- Screw Big Billy.
- Didn't catch that, buddy.
Nothin'. I just said we're right on it, Neal. We're tryin'.
Valley Forge. What's wrong?
You're moving out. You're accelerating.
Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
I have an emergency ignition on Valley Forge, reading red 990.
I get a two-four on Valley Forge, reading red.
Valley Forge to Berkshire,
I've got an emergency.
- Neal? Can you read me, Neal?
- I read you.
I've got a main bus blowout on numbers three, eight and ten panels.
I've got a premature detonation on dome two and an explosion in the cargo deck.
Now, please advise me immediately.
I read you. Put on Wolf, Lowell.
No, change that. Give me Barker.
I can't find Barker or Wolf or Keenan either.
I'm afraid they might have been in dome number two.
God, dome two just blew up. Stand by.
Wolf, Keenan and Barker missing.
What the hell is taking so long?
Coming up now, Valley Forge.
Lowell, this is Anderson.
How are you, boy?
I'm OK.
Lowell, ifyou continue as is, we figure...
..you'll hit the northeastern quadrant of
Saturn's rings at 302 tomorrow morning.
- What does that mean?
- We don't think you'll make it through.
It's a very bad angle. These ships weren't built to shoot the rapids.
The plan is to find where the explosion chopped the main bus and re-route it.
You'll have to do some cutting.
Where do I start?
We tracked a bunch of cargo modules, probably offyour starboard side,...
..so we figure maybe one of the cryo tanks under the floor cut loose.
It may have exposed the main bus duct, if we're lucky.
I'll take a look at it.
Drone number one.
This'll stop 'em.
I need you guys to help me fix my leg.
From now on, you guys are working for me.
Here's a little medical program.
Drone one,...
..drone two, drone three,...
..please report immediately to surgery.
Drone number two,...
..you'll perform the operation.
Drone number three, you'll handle the oxygen anaesthesia.
Drone number one.
Number one, you'll assist.
Commander Anderson.
I can't get anywhere near that main bus duct.
Everything's just all torn up down there.
Listen, Freeman.
That's your first name, right?
Yes.
- Any family, Freeman?
- No, sir.
Well, listen, Freeman.
You've been with this project since the start, and you've known the risks.
Yes, sir.
I... I don't really know how to say this, Freeman.
It's all right, sir.
- We've got some trouble.
- I figured.
Yes. Um...
- I'm really sorry, Freeman.
- Sorry, sir? About what?
We 'll never be able to stop you before you hit the rings.
I see.
Freeman, you might want to consider...
Suicide, sir?
No.
I just don't think that I'd ever be able to do anything like that.
Well, the best we can do, then, is send out a search party the long way around.
But it's kind of like a needle in a haystack, ifyou know what I mean.
Yes, sir.
- Freeman?
- Yes, sir?
God bless you, Freeman.
You're a hell of an American.
Thank you, sir.
I think I am.
Drone number three.
Drone number three, keep moving.
Follow one and two.
Follow one and two!
Why didn't you follow them?
Now dig a hole for him.
Make it seven feet long... and three feet wide.
OK, now, put him... put him down in it.
And then remain there, cos I would like to say something...
..before you cover him over.
Uh...
I...
I would like to be able to say a prayer...
..but I don't...
..really know how to say it.
Wolf and Barker and Keenan,...
..they weren't exactly my friends.
But I did like them.
And, uh,...
..I don't... I don't think...
..that I'll ever be able to...
..excuse what it is that I did,...
..but I had to do it.
And...
I guess that's all that I have to say.
You can cover him over now.
Boys,...
..I'd like to make an announcement. Um...
From now on,...
..drone number two,...
..you will answer to the name of Huey.
And drone number one,...
..you will answer to the name of Dewey.
And little Louie, God bless him, he's...
..he's not with us any more.
Huey,...
..you take one step forward.
That's super.
Now, Dewey, you also take one step forward.
That's really excellent!
Now, um...
..you see, what I've done is,
I've reprogrammed both of you...
..so that now you'll respond directly to me.
You'll still run the same maintenance checks and perform the same duties...
..that you've been doing on the ship,...
..but you'll also be spending much more time with me in the forest.
And you shouldn't have much of a problem in making the necessary readjustments.
And I realise that...
.. we've really had a rough journey,...
..and we sure got our work cut out for us.
But I think that the three of us, together, as a team,...
.. we can manage OK.
Is that all right with you guys?
The three of us together are gonna plant a tree.
Trowel, watering can...
..and the tree.
Now, this is the mulch.
That's what makes the tree grow.
Now.
Now, Huey, you're gonna plant the tree...
..and, Dewey, you're gonna dig the ditch.
Now, we're gonna do it right here on the side of the hill.
That's a real good hole, Dewey.
Now,...
..Huey, here's the tree.
Put a little mulch.
There. OK. Now, plant the tree.
That's pitiful. Pitiful!
That's exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to be.
Earth between my toes and a flower in my hair
That's what I was wearing when we lay among the ferns
Earth between my toes and a flower I will wear
When he returns
Wind upon his face and my fingers in his hair
That's what he was wearing when we lay beneath the sky
Wind upon his face and my love he will wear
When swallows fly
Tears of sorrow running deep
Running silent in my sleep
Running silent in my sleep
What's the matter?
I know you're sad about Louie.
But he got careless! And you see what happens when you get careless?
OK, now, you guys go on back to your work.
Hey, how are you today, huh?
Ow! You bit my hand.
Don't you ever bite my hand again.
You can take a tip from Smokey
That there's nothing like a tree
Oh, they're great for kids to climb in
And they're beautiful to see
Huey... and Dewey.
I want you two guys to report right away to the recreation room.
Well, I see you're already here.
I bet you wonder why I gathered you here, haven't you, huh?
Well, I wanna beg your indulgence.
I got some new programs here for you.
Now.
Huey, come over and sit down here.
Dewey, you come right up here and sit down.
You can come a little closer if you want to, Dewey. Good boy.
That's for you, that's for you...
..and that's for me.
OK, boys.
Now.
I'm about to take you two guys for every dime you got.
Two, three.
Five, five, five.
Now, boys, let's play cards.
OK.
Now, Dewey.
OK.
How many cards you want, Dewey?
What are you doin'?
You threw down three kings.
You're nuts, you know that?
Well, your hand is obviously dead,...
..and let's see what you got here.
Well, he's got trash, so obviously
I'm the winner with three sevens.
Thank you, boys. I'm sorry.
You gotta get up in the morning to beat old Freeman. Early in the morning.
It's all mine. This time we'll play another hand and I don't want any mistakes.
We're not playing for 3-in-1 oil here.
We're playing for money.
OK. Now, Dewey, you took two.
No, I wasn't looking.
Hey, what have I said about talking between you guys? That's not fair.
I'm all by myself and you're talkin' between yourselves.
That's a house rule. No more talking.
Now, how many cards d'you want?
You don't want any cards? You just saw what the man did last hand.
All right. Dealer's taking two.
All right, Huey.
What have you got?
The man had a full house and he knew it!
Now, how about that?
The man had a full house and he knew it.
Huey and Dewey beat me at my own card game!
I know. I've actually been eating that crap.
Now let's go to the forest and get some real food.
What has happened to the forest?
Huey, go get me the grey book.
I don't know.
I just cannot figure out what's wrong.
OK, now, listen to me. I want you to make a slow, complete, 360º turn for me.
OK.
Now, hold it. Stop right there.
That's good. Now take a sample there.
Oh, no.
We're coming to the dome.
Wait right there, Huey.
Huey, I thought I told you to stay in the forest?
You're braced. You can't fall back.
It's OK, Huey. I got it, I got it.
That'll make you rest a little easier now.
Your little light.
No, no, I know where it is.
No, it's OK, Huey.
Just hold steady now.
You won't get that again.
There.
Now, that should be better.
Dewey, go get me that L-arm circuit wrench.
I understand.
I think I can manage here without it.
There.
I'm screwin' you in tight.
I'm sorry, Huey,...
..but that's the best that I can do.
I tried, but that... that's all
I can do for him, Dewey.
I don't know, Huey. It's just not working.
The forest is dying.
I have tried...
..everything.
And I just don't know what the hell it is.
Come in, Valley Forge. This is
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Do you read me?
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?
We got a plot on you, Lowell. Fantastic!
We 're looking forward to seeing you, buddy. You made it!
Transmit, will ya?
Please acknowledge immediately.
Come in, Valley Forge. Can you read?
Please transmit immediately.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
How about a word, Lowell, huh?
Hi.
Lowell?
I'm mighty glad to see ya, boy.
- Who is this?
- This is Anderson, Lowell.
My God, we've looked high and low for you.
How did you find me?
Why did you even try?
Hey, you must be kidding. We couldn't let you go without at least trying to find you.
We said we'd send out a search party.
I guess I forgot.
It wasn't easy finding you either, even with our deep-space tracking.
- I don't suppose it was.
- Freeman,...
..you'll have to find some way to jettison the dome.
And it's awfully dark out here, so it'll be safer ifyou don't blow it up.
The sun.
The sun! That's what it is.
- Did you hear what he said? It's the sun!
- What?
Uh, nothing. I was just saying that everything is all right.
Where was your big explosion?
We can't see it.
The explosion's on the other side of the ship.
Other side? OK. We 'll be docking on your port side in about six hours.
Right, six hours.
Huey, Dewey, come on.
We can still save the forest.
It's gonna work.
Dewey,...
I've taught you everything that I know about taking care of the forest here.
And, uh,...
..that's all that you have to do from now on,...
..is just maintain the forest.
Now, these lights here'll do the job that the sun would do.
They'll help revive everything.
I...
I just can't do it any more.
You see, things...
..things just haven't worked out for me.
Take care of yourself, Dewey.
Huey, you have to come with me...
..because you're just not working well enough to help Dewey.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
We 'll be docking on your port side in two hours. Stand by for updates.
Take good care of the forest, Dewey.
You know, when I was a kid,...
..I put a note into a bottle...
..and it had my name and address on it.
And then I threw the bottle into the ocean.
And I never knew if anybody ever found it.
Heels of children running wild
In the sun
Like a forest is your child
Growing wild
In the sun
Doomed in his innocence
In the sun
Gather your children to your side
In the sun
Tell them all they love will die
Tell them why
In the sun
Tell them it's not too late
Cultivate, one by one
Tell them to harvest
And rejoice
In the sun
THIS IS THE ANT.
TREAT IT WITH RESPECT.
FOR IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE NEXT
DOMINANT LIFE FORM OF OUR PLANET.
SOUND INCREDIBLE? IMPOSSIBLE?
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A GOOD, CLOSE LOOK
AT WHAT THE ANT IS ALL ABOUT?
LIKE THESE ATTA CEPHALOTES.
ONE OF THE 15,000 DIFFERENT
SPECIES INHABITING OUR PLANET.
THIS ONE CULTIVATES CROPS
OF FUNGUS FOR FOOD.
OTHERS HERD APHIDS,
JUST AS MAN HERDS CATTLE.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE WARRIORS?
THE BUILDERS OF BRIDGES, ROADS, TUNNELS?
FRIGHTENING, ISN'T IT, THAT
A CREATURE AS SMALL AS AN ANT
IS ABLE TO HAVE A FAIR
CLAIM TO RANK NEXT TO MAN
IN THE SCALE OF INTELLIGENCE?
THEY HAVE A SOPHISTICATED
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.
SPECIFIC MESSAGES ARE TRANSMITTED
FROM ONE ANT TO ANOTHER
THROUGH THE USE OF A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
CALLED PHEROMONES.
IT CAUSES AN OBLIGATORY RESPONSE.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
OBLIGATORY.
PHEROMONES GIVE AN ORDER
THAT CANNOT BE DISOBEYED.
IT'S A MIND-BENDING SUBSTANCE
THAT FORCES OBEDIENCE.
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
THAT'S BUSINESS BETTER LEFT TO THE ANTS.
Got it?
What took you so long?
I stopped to get some extra liquor.
You should've let me know.
I didn't know I was supposed to be on call.
You're always supposed to be on call.
Sorry, Ms. Fryser.
That's all right, sweetheart.
You're so terrific in the sack that it almost justifies the excessive salary that I have to pay you.
By the way, captain...
Try and give us the smoothest possible trip, will you?
We don't want any of our prospective buyers getting seasick.
Yes, ma'am.
Sick people do not buy property.
I'll cut between the waves.
You do that.
I'm sure you remember, by the way, that I'm paying you damn good money to rent this boat, captain.
I'm sure that if I forget, you'll remind me.
Oh, well, it looks like our guests are finally arriving.
Sure a nice boat, isn't it?
We went on a bigger one to Mexico that time.
Yeah, but we paid for that trip.
Two-bit cruise down the coast to look at overpriced swampland.
You always said you wanted a home on the ocean.
Yeah, I said a lot of things.
You coming?
Yeah, yeah, all right.
You win. We'll go for a boat ride.
Here's a $10. Keep the change.
But, lady, the fare's $9.80. don't mention it.
What are you doing?
The letter said everything was free.
I'm writing down all our expenses so we can be reimbursed.
Umm...
Before I board your ship, may I ask you a question?
Yes, ma'am.
I just want to make certain that I'm under no obligation to buy any of your property, in case I change my mind.
It's not my property, lady.
I just get you there and get you back.
Thank you.
Let's get this circus on the road.
Hi. Are you Ms. Ellis? Yes.
I'm Marilyn Fryser, I'm the president of Dreamland Shores.
Come and meet some people. This is Mr. and Mrs. Lawson.
Hello.
And this is Larry Graham.
I think we have everybody on-board now.
Think that'll please the bitch?
Ever see anything that did?
What a rip-off.
She'll bring a boatload of slobs down here and convince them it's paradise.
It wouldn't be so bad around here if it was close to something.
A road, a town, anything.
What about diamond Springs?
Sure, that's practically next door.
All you do is walk 2 miles to the river and swim upstream another 10.
You ought to read the contract she makes them sign.
The jerks that buy this swampland can't even sell it for 2 years.
Dreamland shores won't be here in 2 years.
Why don't you try some of the meatballs over there?
They are really tasty.
Are you ladies having a good time?
Lovely.
Just marvelous, thank you.
It'd be wonderful. Everything is so fresh.
It's unbelievable.
Everything all right here?
It's great.
You won't believe how difficult it was for me to convince Larry to come this weekend.
Mr. Thompson? Yes.
Have you taken some good pictures?
I think I have some dandies.
Excuse me.
Where are those 2 guys that you hired?
I suppose they finished their work and they left.
Left?
Well, you can tell them that they're fired.
Speaking of that, why don't you try a little of that old-world charm that you're so famous for on our guests?
I'm not running a charity organization.
I've always wanted to live near the water.
It's beautiful here, isn't it?
Yes, it is lovely.
How are you doing?
Fine. Charlie, right?
Right.
Good, Charlie.
What are you doing?
Trying to figure out what everybody's doing here?
Here to buy land. What else?
Not everyone.
Our average is 1 out of 3 people come along just for the ride.
You should be more careful who you invite.
We sure would like to, but we get stuck with that statistic no matter what.
What about this group?
Think you can figure out who'll be the buyers and who aren't?
Not exactly.
But I think I've got you figured out.
Tell me.
Not only could you not afford a lot, but I think you'd have a hell of a time swinging for the boat ride.
Am I right?
Cheers.
Excuse me.
Have you had enough?
Enough what?
Party bullshit.
I know what you mean.
Why don't we take a look around?
See if this place is for real.
I don't think your wife would like that.
Uh, we have different interests.
I'm sure you do.
How about it?
Yes, Mr. Stratton is the vice president of international management consultants.
I've worked for him about 20 years.
His personal executive secretary, you understand.
It's quite a responsibility.
Cheap scotch. I think its all a come-on.
So what? It's free, isn't it?
That's what velma and I like the most.
That's a long time to be with one company.
Not when you consider all the benefits that can accrue...
Gifts, bonuses, retirement pension.
No wonder you're looking into land investments.
I wouldn't say that I'm exactly looking for investments.
Now, don't you worry.
Nobody is going to hustle you into buying anything.
Dreamland Shores sells itself.
Mmph!
That's not what we came out here for.
Come on.
I must be crazy or something.
I just met you an hour ago and here I am out in the woods playing hot fingers.
Loosen up.
Let me go!
Look, I just got out of one married man.
Not with me.
It'll be one of the big disappointments in my life.
Where you going?
Let go!
Come on.
You know what it's all about, baby.
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Relax, relax.
That's it.
I just want to get to know you, that's all.
Ok.
We're gonna be good friends. Aah!
Shit!
Ohh! Ohh!
Excuse me.
I was going to ask you if you'd like to join the entertainment, but I see you found your own.
Yeah, we were just looking around.
Yeah, we were just looking around.
If you're looking for the party, it's right down there.
I'm not much for parties.
Besides, I want to talk to you.
It's Dan, isn't it?
What do you want to talk about?
Here. This place.
Dreamland shores.
Look, lady, I told you,
I'm just the boat driver.
I get you here and I get you back.
I don't sell the land, all right?
Exactly, so you shouldn't care one way or another.
I don't. I don't give a damn.
You see, I want to open a small business.
Maybe an agency for domestic help.
But it's going to take all the savings I've got, so I've got to make certain that I make the best investment possible.
I don't have any opinions about that.
Well, but you'd be honest with me.
Like, this land they're trying to sell us, is it a good thing?
Or not?
Lady, if you want advice, would you ask somebody else, please?
I just had a pretty rough time of it myself.
And I guess if I weren't so sick of the whole routine,
I'd probably be doing what you're doing right now.
I beg your pardon?
All this self-pity,
"nobody-gives-a-damn" attitude.
What?
The booze.
Right.
You know, umm when I met you on the boat,
I didn't like you very much.
That's not exactly a surprise.
I don't know.
I guess I thought you were one of those macho, phony types, the kind whose brains fall out every time he unzips his fly.
Say, what is this, group therapy?
Maybe.
I can't afford to make a mistake, that's all.
I lied to them back there before.
I told them I had a good job, been working for the same man for 20 years.
The truth of it is, he fired me.
All I've got is severance pay and references.
I've got a job that pays $30,000 a year,
I own a 2-bedroom condominium,
I've got a $10,000 sports car,
I've got a wife and I got a 4-year-old kid who thinks I'm god.
How's that?
That's terrific. That's fabulous.
Look, I was just trying to tell you that
I changed my mind about not liking you.
That's all.
Forget it.
I'm a bad investment.
And why do you say that?
Because the...
$30,000-a-year job went in the toilet last year.
And the sports car needs an overhaul.
And my wife is an ex-wife, who's suing me for back support.
My kid won't even talk to me on the phone.
What about your condominium?
Plastic, like everything else.
Shall we?
Ok.
If it was my money and I was going to buy this land, first, I'd make sure they struck oil on it, and then I'd still think twice.
Does that answer your question?
Ok.
Dan.
You got a button off your shirt.
If you got time, I always carry a needle and thread.
I don't need any buttons.
This building here is gonna be torn down.
And the dreamland shores beach club is gonna be constructed in its place.
It'll be the most beautiful and modern club imaginable, with every possible convenience.
If we all get into the tram, now, where Charlie is, we'll be off on our little tour.
Here we go.
NOW, DON'T FORGET,
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING,
JUST SHOUT THEM OUT.
WE'RE VERY INFORMAL HERE
AND THIS TOUR IS STRICTLY
FOR YOUR PLEASURE.
I THINK ALL OF YOU BOATING
ENTHUSIASTS WILL BE
INTERESTED IN THESE
PRESENTLY-AVAILABLE LOTS,
WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE,
ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED
RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARINA.
ALL OF THE HOUSE LOTS YOU SEE HERE
WILL BE SOLD ON A FIRST
COME, FIRST SERVED BASIS.
IF YOU SEE A LOT THAT APPEALS TO YOU,
JUST TELL CHARLIE OR ME
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU FIRST REFUSAL.
Larry, what do you think?
It's not what I think, it's what daddy thinks, isn't it?
Honey, you know my father only wants to help us...
Both of us.
He'd help us a lot more if he'd leave us alone.
Then maybe he'd be satisfied with what I could give you.
YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WE
HAVE CAREFULLY PRESERVED
THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF DREAMLAND SHORES.
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE LONG WALKS
INTO THESE SECLUDED AREAS.
BIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES
AND FRAGRANT FLOWERS.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOLF ENTHUSIASTS,
YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO BE SITUATED
OVERLOOKING THE 18-HOLE GOLF COURSE,
WHICH WILL SOON BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
AFTER WE STOP AT OUR PICNIC
AREA FOR REFRESHMENTS,
WE'LL GO ON AND LOOK AT SOME
OF THE INLAND PROPERTIES.
HERE WE ARE.
Be careful getting out, now.
Now, if we're really lucky, we may get some glimpses of some of the fascinating wildlife that's in this area.
Do you know there are 100 different kinds of birds here?
There are? Yes.
I've seen over 50 myself.
Charlie?
You want to help me with the sandwiches, darling?
Would you like a plate?
Thank you.
It almost looks like those romantic places you used to see in old movies.
What does your husband think about the idea?
He's not very interested.
Oh, what a shame.
But your husband seems to be.
Then I took one of those long, slow looks.
You know the kind you take on a rainy weekend when he's home playing goody-goody family man?
I got up one day, got dressed and told the bastard to go back to his wife.
You know something?
From then on, it was just like a breath of fresh air.
I cashed in my fur coat and all the other little knick-knacks and decided to buy myself a piece of something really legitimate...
Like a house.
I could go to bed when
I wanted to go to bed.
That's why I'm here.
Although, you know,
I really don't know what's so great about owning a house.
Thomas, what are you doing?
Looking, just looking.
You're trying to find fault, aren't you?
You don't trust anybody.
Most people are dishonest.
Lets get back to the others.
In a minute, in a minute.
Look at this, Mary! It's a water pipe!
It isn't even connected!
It's a fraud, just like I said.
These people are dishonest.
This is a fraud!
Trust people? I tell you, you can't trust anybody, Mary.
You can't trust anybody.
I hope you've learned your lesson.
Look!
What's that sound?
Who cares?
I found what I was looking for.
Listen, Thomas, it's all around us.
Mary, will you leave...
Oh, my god.
Run, Mary, run!
Help, Mary, help!
Help, Mary, help me!
Ahh!
Oh, my god!
OVER THERE, ABOUT 50 YARDS,
WILL BE OUR COMMUNITY RECREATION CENTER.
IT WILL HAVE A COMPLETE
WORKSHOP AND HOBBY ROOM.
THERE WILL BE A THEATER, A BOWLING ALLEY,
POOL TABLES, SAUNAS, EVERY CONVENIENCE.
The Lawsons.
Where are the Lawsons?
They ducked out back at the picnic area.
Why didn't you say something?
After listening to you on that bullhorn for 2 hours,
I was ready to duck out myself.
Keep moving, Charlie.
There's a lot more to see, everybody.
What's that noise?
Seems to be coming from over there.
It's nothing to worry about.
It's probably some of our pumping equipment.
Marilyn, there's no pump. We'd better get back to that boat.
Shut up.
There's nothing to worry about, everybody.
WHEN YOU COMPARE ALL THE
BENEFITS OF DREAMLAND SHORES
TO OTHER LAND INVESTMENTS
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN,
I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL REALIZE
WHAT A WONDERFUL VALUE WE HAVE HERE.
Oh, my god! Look!
That's Pete, one of our workers.
My god! What happened?
Take it easy.
Holy Jesus.
Hey, we'd better go look for the Lawsons.
Who'll go with me? Larry?
No, I'm not going out there.
No, not me. I'm an old man.
We only came because it was free.
We take these tours all the time.
But nothing ever happened like this before.
It's ok, Harry.
Joe, I'll go with you.
All right.
We'll meet you back at the boat.
Mr. Lawson!
Mr. Lawson!
Joe.
Oh, my god.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Oh, my god.
What the hell are they?
That's my boat.
Dan!
Oh, my god.
Let's pick them up at the beach!
Get up!
Ahh!
Aahh!
We're never gonna get out of here.
Why is this happening?
Larry.
I can't believe this.
God.
They don't like fire. That's for sure.
All we have to do is keep this damn fire going.
They just couldn't be.
Joe?
Ants.
Why don't we go into the old beach house?
We'll be safe inside there.
Without that fire, those things would be inside with us in 2 minutes.
Goddammit, why do you shoot down everything that I say?
You never did like working for me just because I'm a woman.
They're waiting.
They're out there waiting until the fire dies.
Can't you hear them?
Where did they come from?
How the hell did they get that size?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking of a way out.
All we wanted was to enjoy what was left of our life.
Is that bad?
Hey, how about some candy?
It's good. It'll make you feel better.
Come on.
It's yours if you want it.
Better get some more wood for that fire.
You're not gonna need any wood.
Charlie?
Yeah?
The tent and the workers...
I didn't bring them. How did they get here?
A river north of here about 2 miles.
We've a got boat on that river, a small boat!
You expect us to walk 2 miles through that jungle?
Oh no, we're gonna stay right here until help comes!
When the hell is that gonna be, Marilyn?
Look, as soon as they know that we're missing, they'll send a search party!
I am not gonna leave dreamland shores!
You can stay here and be buried on dreamland shores.
That fire goes out,
I'm gonna be someplace else.
Well, do you want to try for the river or not?
It's unanimous, Joe. We're all too scared to vote.
No!
No, they'll kill us.!
Larry, why don't you just wait for them here!
Charlie, we're not leaving!
I'm gonna stay here and you're gonna stay with me.
We'll go into the beach house.
You're crazy, Marilyn!
We've gotta go!
Marilyn!
Marilyn!
Oh! Aah!
Ahh!
Keep going!
Come on.
Oh, god!
Keep going.
The beach house is full of them!
Dozens of giant ants!
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
There!
I can't keep up!
Let's go this way.
Careful, now. don't stumble.
Don't worry, sweetie, we'll be safe in there.
Larry!
Ahh!
What? Larry, wait!
Oh!
My ankle!
Agh!
Larry!
Oh, please, don't leave me!
Larry!
Come on. Let's go.
Come on!
Charlie! Charlie!
Oh, god!
Oh, god, no, please!
Go!
The rain stopped.
It's a good omen.
All right?
There it is. There's the boat.
Joe!
We're coming through.
We lost the old couple.
Hang on.
What about Christine?
No, she didn't make it.
Come on. I'm not going with you.
Get in the boat.
Charlie's dead. I want to stay with him.
Get in the goddamn boat!
Ok, Joe, let's go.
Get your fingers out of the way. Move them.
You're working for me, remember?
I'm still in charge here.
Would you like to row?
Very funny.
See? I told you we'd be safe.
They're gone now.
So quiet.
God, why is it so quiet?
We got away from them. We left them all back there.
We did, didn't we? Joe? Dan?
I don't know.
Thank god we're safe.
Charlie never got away from them.
We'll never get away from them.
This has turned out to be one hell of a free vacation.
I loved Christine, you know.
I hope that nice old couple got away.
What were their names?
Harry and velma.
I wish I hadn't seen Charlie die like that.
What was I supposed to do?
She ran off.
I turned around and she was gone.
I went to look for her.
Nobody's blaming you, Larry.
We're not saying it's your fault.
You think I saw the ants kill her, don't you?
Go ahead and say it! Go on!
Why would we think that?
Mr. Stratton always liked a cup of nice hot tea at the end of a hard day, with a slice of orange peel.
I took very good care of him.
I started there as a file clerk.
And after all those years, do you know how they gave me my notice of termination?
It was a little piece of paper...
A memo.
"Dear Ms. Ellis,
"this is to inform you
"that your services are no longer required
"and your employment is hereby terminated.
You will receive the usual severance pay, as is customary with this firm.
Mr. Stratton didn't even sign it.
I've never done anything like this, never taken any chances, never done anything dangerous.
It's not fair that this should happen to me.
Oh, Larry, if it's any consolation, none of us are enjoying this boat ride anymore than you are.
Main part of the river looks like it comes from that way.
It's to the left. We should go left.
I'm glad somebody's sure.
Either way, just as long as we keep moving.
It's my life, goddammit! Go left!
Congratulations, Larry.
You're also a dynamite navigator.
Go to hell.
Shut up, you two.
Why don't you all shut up?
We can get around it.
If you say so, Larry. You're the navigator.
Can you move it?
Why don't we walk it around?
I don't want to portage it.
How can we get past that?
Dan! Dan!
Get them away!
Dan!
Larry, I'm...
I'm sorry about the navigator crack, if it matters.
It doesn't.
Ok. Forget it.
We're all on edge.
We say things we don't mean.
Yeah, well, tell that bitch, don't tell me.
Look out!
Help me!
Help me!
God help me!
We'll be fine along the beach.
Watch that tree!
Ok.
Oh!
Let's continue upstream.
We'll just follow the river.
Hold it!
What? What is it?
Ahh...
Nothing.
Thought I heard something.
Listen! Wait a minute.
I told you that this river didn't lead anywhere.
You should have listened to me, dammit!
I don't care what the rest of you do.
I am gonna go in this direction!
Marilyn! Marilyn!
Ahh!
It's all right.
What do we do now?
Obviously, they can kill us any time they want to.
They just don't seem to want to right now.
Why not?
Can't you tell?
What do you mean?
I mean, they don't want us to go that way and they don't want us to go back the way we came.
That only leaves one way... upstream.
Oh, my god! They're herding us like cattle!
Ahh!
God, where'd they come from?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, my god!
It's civilization!
Where are we?
Is there a town near here?
You folks look like you've been out in that storm all night.
It wasn't the storm that bothered us.
There's a real horror show coming upriver behind us.
Giant ants, big as you are.
They've already killed killed some people.
Phoebe will call the sheriff.
Have you seen them?
Phoebe! Call the sheriff!
Phoebe's a very good wife.
Giant ants. That's hard to believe.
Never thought I'd live to see the day.
What are you gonna do, sheriff?
Well...
First thing, I'm gonna get you people situated.
Then I'll get some deputies and go back to the river and start searching.
I told you, those things are vicious as hell.
A couple of deputies won't do you much good.
I got a whole town if I need it.
I don't know how many of them are out there. don't worry about it.
Any ants come this way, we'll take care of them.
The sugar refinery.
On the way back, I better alert them.
They're so close to the river.
You folks don't have to worry anymore.
All you have to do is rest, unwind and we'll get you cleaned up.
I radioed one of my deputies to make arrangements.
I hope this place is nice enough for you folk.
That's very kind of you, sheriff.
Sheriff, I'd like to make a phone call.
My friend at the state capital could get help here fast.
Sure, go ahead.
What I really want to do is go home.
As soon as we get the main highway open, you can all be on your way. don't tell me your problems, Harrison, and I won't tell you mine.
I want that shipment of sugar in my town by day after tomorrow or you can forget it.
Mayor, you got some customers here.
Be with you in a minute.
Long-distance phone.
Yeah, I'd like to place a person-to-person call to Mr. John Amstead in the state attorney's office at the capital.
Any more problems, you call me at once, you hear?
Anson Parker. He owns the motel.
He's also our mayor.
Very wealthy. don't take 3 days to drive those rigs from your place to mine.
It's a lousy 800 miles.
Tell the men to drive all night if they have to.
Remember that sugar refinery we passed on our way here?
Something funny.
Funny?
Yeah.
When we were back at that old couple's house, the woman said something to me that just didn't make sense, that's all.
What did she say?
She said, "whatever you do, don't let them take you to the sugar refinery."
Isn't that crazy?
There's no way to get a call through?
Dammit, don't you have some emergency lines?
It's none of your business what I'm doing with the sugar.
Our refinery is turning out all it can, full blast and we need more.
Ok. Fine. Bye-bye.
Sorry.
A little business problem.
You must have come up from dreamland shores.
How did you know we came from dreamland shores?
Fix these people up with something real nice, mayor.
The best in the house.
Y'all just sign the register, please?
I guess I've done all that I can.
I'll go back to the river and look for...
What you were talking about.
A problem, sheriff?
I'll tell you later when I've more time.
If I find anything, I'm gonna let you know.
You'll find something.
You know, I think you're right.
Is there any place around here I can rent a car?
A couple of blocks up the street.
Good, we're gonna want to get home.
Why don't you guys get some rest for a while?
I'll sleep to that.
All I need is a hot bath.
If you fellows have any problems, just tell them to call me.
Yeah, we'll do that. Thanks.
Finish your phone call?
No, all the lines are down because of the storm.
That's odd, the mayor was talking long-distance.
How do you suppose they got his call through?
Driver's license?
Yes, we need it to verify that you're a qualified driver.
I lost it. What about you?
I don't have anything.
Look, Miss, the mayor said if we had any trouble, you could call him.
Well, I will need a name.
You didn't lose that, did you?
Joseph morrison.
And your local address, Mr. morrison?
We don't have a local address, just the motel where we're staying.
I see.
Look honey, will you just call the mayor and get us a car?
Well, I'm supposed to follow the rules.
Couldn't you bend the rules a little bit?
Maybe I can process the application a different way.
Right. Can you come back later?
How much later?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
It's the best I can do.
That's the only car rental agency in town.
That son of a bitch lied to us.
Said they were going downriver and look for the ants.
Let's go.
Careful.
Didn't see us.
I hope that's the last we see of that place.
What are you looking for?
I'm looking for a gun.
Not that we'd be that lucky.
THIS HIPPIE LIFE and maps of Florida and some road flares.
Well, at least we're set if the car breaks down.
Oh, shit.
God.
Get down, everybody.
Get them! don't let them get away!
Hey, don't shoot. We're peaceful, honest to god.
All right?
Go on.
All right.
Can't you guys take a joke?
Take it easy.
Run!
Dan!
Go! Run!
No, don't fire!
We have enough here to begin with.
Pick him up.
We have a chance if we can get to the river and find a boat and get help for the others.
Just keep moving.
There's enough sugar there to feed an army and they turn out that much every day.
Keep moving!
Ow!
Ahh!
Please, there's nothing to fear, nothing.
Come along. Nothing to fear.
Please, come on.
Isn't she beautiful?
She's fantastic.
She needs us.
That's why it has to be this way, why we must obey.
We have no choice.
She makes us do it.
At first, uh, people don't understand.
They must be forced into submission.
After their indoctrination, they realize that the ants only want us to take care of them and to feed them.
Every week, the people must be brought back here to be indoctrinated again.
She's the only one that can do it.
She's the queen ant.
You see how easy it is.
Once you feel her energy, then you'll understand that we can all work together.
We can all do what the ants want us to.
Work for them, feed them.
That's the way it should be, for they are superior.
Since you are our guests, won't you take the front of the line, please?
No!
Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch!
Joe!
Put them here with the others.
- Stop it!
- Quiet down!
No! No! Please!
No, let me go! Please!
Let me out of here. don't you see? We mustn't disobey them.
We must take care of them and we must help them.
Keep the line moving.
Get him out of there!
You can't!
Take the women down to the river!
Go on! Get the hell out of here!
Uh.
Joe!
Oh, god! Joe!
Where is he? Where is he?
No!
Get in the boat.
Get her in the boat!
Joe!
Dan!
Joe!
2130, day 547.
Unscheduled course correction due at 2200.
Pre-correction check:
Rotation axis plus three degrees.
Nitrous oxide pressure:
4,100, rising to 5,000.
Quad jets C and D on pre-select.
Rotor ignition sequence beginning in 3-0.
Thruster line reactors on standby.
Vincent, notify me with 15 to go.
- Alex?
- Yes, Dan.
Have you determined the difference in ETAs with and without our correction?
Working on it. You know, we shouldn't be needing a direction at this time.
Vincent, run a confirmation on the last inertial fix... and check it with another celestial, please.
I have.
It is correct... but I think I've found the reason for our present variation.
- Mr Pizer.
- Yes, Vincent.
Mr Pizer, I think you should come up here.
What's up, Vincent?
The largest black hole
I have ever encountered, Mr Pizer.
Hmm. Let's have a look at it on the holograph.
My God!
Right out of Dante's Inferno.
Yes. The most destructive force in the universe, Harry.
Nothing can escape it, not even light.
I had a professor who predicted that eventually black holes... would devour the entire universe.
Why not, when you can see giant suns sucked in and disappear without a trace?
- Give us the magnification, Vincent.
- Polarizing image.
Every time I see one of those things,
I expect to spot some guy in red with horns and a pitchfork.
It's a monster, all right.
A rip in the very fabric of space and time... but I picked up something else of interest.
- Let's see it.
- It hasn't moved since I first picked it up.
- It seems to be some kind of ship.
- Do you copy, Alex?
- Roger, Dan.
- Enlarge again, Vincent, and let's try to identify it.
But how could anybody be out here ahead of us?
Arcturius-10, United Kingdom.
Liberty-7, United States.
Russian experimental space station,
series five.
France, Sahara Module 5-3.
Pluto-4, Japan.
United States,
Space Probe One.
- That's it.
- USS Cygnus.
Dr Kate, wasn't that the ship
your father was on?
USS Cygnus.
Its mission: To discover habitable life in outer space. Same as ours.
Signal that ship, Vincent.
- Activate the sensors, Charlie.
- You bet.
They were recalled to Earth
20 years ago... their mission considered a failure.
How that must have galled
Dr Hans Reinhardt.
Did you ever meet
Commander Reinhardt?
Collided with him would be a more accurate description.
- A legend.
- So he believed.
Reinhardt had the knack of making his own ambitions... seem like a matter of national pride.
Why, he talked the space appropriations committee... into the costliest fiasco of all time... and refused to admit failure.
He ignored his recall.
Maybe not.
Maybe it never got through.
That ship just... just disappeared.
They've never been seen again.
Dan, get us in close enough. Vincent and I could get aboard on tethers.
To quote Cicero, "Rashness is the characteristic of youth... prudence that of mellowed age and discretion the better part of valour."
No sense leaving the story of a lifetime untold, Captain.
I believe there is, Harry... and it's looking straight at us.
Picking up anything on the sensors, Charlie?
Negative, but with all that turbulence...
out there, our signal
might not be getting through.
According to my instruments, it hasn't moved a centimetre... since we first spotted it.
But, Alex, how can a lifeless derelict defy that kind of gravity?
I don't know, but it's certainly worth investigating.
My instincts
are against it, Alex... but we'll go in for a closer look.
Fix a coordinate approach, Charlie.
Full power on the thrusters, Vincent.
Strap yourselves in. We'll be feeling the gravitational force... right now.
Range: 29551 and closing.
What's your reading on Cygnus, Vincent?
Triangulation shows it's still holding steady, sir.
- Gravity pull?
- .02450 and rising.
Puts us in an escape attitude of
8-5 degrees. Cut power by two-thirds.
- 8-5 degrees.
She's bucking like a bronco.
- Gravity?
.46960, still climbing.
Switching to manual.
Captain, I'm not sure how long the engines will remain operable... against that much force when we turn back.
Alex, gravity's close to maximum.
We can afford one pass, and then we're gonna have to get the hell out.
- Zero gravity.
- Cut the power.
Smooth as glass.
It's like being in the eye of a hurricane.
- What happened?
- Natural phenomenon.
Or something from that ship.
Activating the microbeam.
Picking up anything, Charlie?
Negative, Alex. No way our signals can't get through this time.
- Gravity's at maximum, Dan.
- My God, I think it's got us.
We're starting to tumble.
Hundred percent on the roll jet quads.
Roll jet quads, full capacity.
- Air break at midship. Losing oxygen.
- Charlie... give me a full burst at 180 degrees, main thrusters.
We got a break here too!
Emergency readouts show the primary and secondary air lines ruptured!
Never rains.
Full-pitch attitude thrusters,
A and B rings.
The black hole is pulling us in.
Going to manual.
The number four hatch blew outward,
Captain. I'll go out and secure it.
Watch yourself out there, Vincent.
There's more gravity pull than we've ever encountered.
Yes, sir.
Alex, we'd better check out the damage below!
Vincent, do you read me?
Come in, Vincent.
Kate, either we have a malfunction here... or there's too much interference on the outside.
See if you can get through to Vincent with your ESP.
I got through to Vincent.
He said there are old pilots and there are bold pilots... but there are very few old, bold pilots.
She's tuned in on Vincent, all right.
Grab my leg! My leg!
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
And that's got it!
Hit the boosters, Charlie. We gotta make a run for that zero gravity.
He secured the hatch!
Good.
We can only make temporary repairs
here, Dan, and that's only
to the secondary line.
Unless we can replace the damaged parts in the main regulator... we're gonna lose our oxygen supply.
Damn!
Dan, the tether's broken.
- I'm going after him.
- Stay at your post, Charlie.
What the hell are you made of?
- What if it were one of us out there?
- Vincent is one of us.
Reverse thrusters and look for a place to set down.
- What's going on?
- That's what I'd like to know.
Like a tree on Christmas morning.
Locking warheads into firing position.
Hold it, Dan. They've got to be friendly. They could have blasted us right out of the sky.
Your side, Dan.
You got a picture down there?
- There are people on board.
- Just a shadow, Kate.
Enlarge, please.
There are people, Alex.
I know it. I feel it.
Docking elevator coming up.
Wonder why they didn't roll out the red carpet earlier.
I don't know, and I don't like it.
But they're calling the shots, and we've got to repair this craft.
Dan, I'm sorry I blew my stack.
I guess we all have a soft spot for the little guy, Charlie.
- Yeah.
- All right, let's bring her in.
Okay.
Bingo.
We have gravity.
Nice work, Vincent.
Out of the frying pan; hopefully, not into the fire.
- Are you all right, Vincent?
- Nothing a hammer and a little metal polish can't fix. Thank you.
Looks like we'll have to go to them.
- Charlie, you'll stay with the Palomino.
- But you need everyone that's got...
- Charlie.
- Don't worry, Mr Pizer.
They also serve who only stand and wait.
Vincent, were you programmed to bug me?
No, sir, to educate you.
When I volunteered for this mission,
I never thought I'd end up playing straight man to a tin can.
This place looks as if it hasn't been used for years.
It's eerie. I feel like a thousand eyes are watching us.
Vincent!
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Vincent, are you all right?
Weapons destroyed by laser fire.
No injuries. Hold your position.
Vincent.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Down, but never for the full count, Dr Kate.
- So much for the friendship theory.
- Come on, Harry. They could have killed us if they'd wanted to.
Yeah, sure.
I don't like it when somebody else pulls the strings, Captain.
Neither do I, Vincent.
Whoever's up in that control tower is calling the shots right now.
Whoever or whatever, Captain.
- Easy, Kate.
- I know I shouldn't get my hopes up, but it's hard not to.
I know.
I don't mind telling you,
I'm a little concerned.
Some of my brother robots were assigned to Project Black Hole... programmed to send ESP messages back from space probes.
Oh, a grand experiment, the scientists thought.
Also ancient history, Vincent.
Not to me, Mr Booth.
Not this close.
The heat in there melts types like me rather quickly.
Hello? I'm Kate McCrae.
Is Officer Frank McCrae aboard?
They appear to be some sort of robot, Dr Kate.
Look over here.
Incredible.
It oughta be.
Sure cost the taxpayers enough.
Kate.
There's someone else with us.
Identify yourself.
What is your type and model?
- A mystery monster.
- Don't move.
Charlie, do you read me?
Charlie Pizer. Come in, Charlie.
This is the story to end all stories, Harry.
A ship of robots and computers with this thing in charge?
Not quite, Dr Durant.
Maximilian and my robots only run this ship the way I wish it run.
How do you know my name?
You were monitored ever since our sensors first detected you.
Now, now, Maximilian.
Calm down.
Don't pick on small people.
Such a nice little robot.
He's harmless.
Miss McCrae, you might come closer.
Welcome aboard the Cygnus.
Hans Reinhardt.
It can't be.
You always did have a flair for theatrical entrances, Doctor.
Dr Reinhardt.
My father, where is he?
My dear child,
I'm sorry to dash your hopes... but your father's not with us any more.
He's dead.
A man to be proud of.
A grave personal loss to me.
He was a trusted and loyal friend.
And you are his daughter.
Yes. The same eyes.
The same eyes.
And the rest of the crew?
- They didn't make it back?
- They did not.
Pity, for such a good crew.
What happened when your mission was recalled, Doctor?
Is this going to be an interview, Mr Booth?
I haven't had that for a long time, but if you want to...
I will answer.
Now, don't be frightened.
Nobody's going to harm you.
The Cygnus encountered a field of meteorites... and was disabled... our main and auxiliary communication systems smashed.
We were adrift.
I told the crew to abandon ship... to return home as ordered.
Perhaps it was another of what you term my "theatrical gestures," Mr Booth... but I chose to remain aboard.
Your dear father chose to remain with me.
We never knew what happened to the others.
You've lived out here for 20 years? Alone?
Twenty years?
Twenty Earth years, but...
I didn't live exactly alone.
I've created companions of a sort.
They look a bit medieval... but I'm a romantic.
Ah, Mr Pizer!
Come in. Join us.
Thank you.
Have you met the goon squad?
"Goon squad." Nice.
I'm Hans Reinhardt.
Forgive this little incident, but you were disarmed for your own safety.
Dismissed.
My robots are programmed to react against any act of aggression.
I assure you, none was intended.
I am glad to hear that. Please.
Consider yourselves my guests.
We won't impose on your hospitality, Doctor.
Just long enough to repair our ship.
And then we can offer you the means of returning to Earth, Doctor.
What makes you think
I want to return?
The Cygnus is in danger of being destroyed here.
Yes! Your captain was worried about that too.
One step too far... and we are done.
But there's no cause for alarm.
We developed antigravity forces to maintain our position.
It's what you might call a Mexican stand-off.
If you were monitoring us, you must have picked up our signals.
- That's right.
- You failed to reply.
Did I have to reply?
Charlie, Charlie.
Slight communications problem.
Maximilian will take you to requisition whatever you need to repair your ship.
In the meantime, you and Dr McCrae will get enough information... to make your mission of historic importance.
- Back off, Vincent.
- Not until he does.
When you're nose to nose with a trash compactor, you cool it.
Now, what does that remind me of?
Oh, yes. David and Goliath.
A classic confrontation.
Only this time,
David is overmatched.
Call him off, Reinhardt.
I said call him off!
On my ship, you ask, Captain.
Indeed.
Please, call him off, Doctor.
Maximilian?
Remember, these are our guests.
Now, let him in.
Show that you've good manners.
That's a good robot.
Communication problems aside, he took an awful long time to show any lights.
- Be careful.
- I know.
Those other robots aren't any friendlier than Dr Frankenstein's monster.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Maybe you should've smiled when you said it, Vincent.
Doctor, this ship doesn't appear to be crippled.
Of course not. We repaired the damage and became operable again.
But you never obeyed the order to return to Earth.
That's right.
I refused this order.
There were larger considerations... other worlds yet to be explored... life dreams unrealized.
The authorities would still consider that an act of piracy, Doctor.
What would you have said, Mr Booth, if the authorities... would have called back Columbus just before he discovered the New World?
You wouldn't even exist.
I'm about to prove to you that the end justifies the means.
Pretty busy around here, Max.
What are you gearing up for?
Tell you what, Charlie.
You'll take care of business here, and I'll go back to the ship and start working on that regulator.
Don't bother to point the way, Max.
I'll find it by myself.
Well, we need primary and secondary demand oxygen pressure regulators... and an ECS proportion flow valve controller.
Max.
Dr Reinhardt told you to requisition the parts for us.
Let's get cracking.
Way to go, Max.
Way to go.
Vincent. Vital Information
Necessary Centralized.
Labour force. The 396.
I see by your markings you're from the old 2-8.
Programmed in Houston.
There is enough instant energy down there to supply all of Earth.
The first step to colonizing the galaxy.
You will be remembered as one of the greatest space scientists of all time.
I have never doubted that.
It's about time that people learn about their failures and my successes.
You should come back with us and enjoy the glory of that success.
I don't want to go back, and I don't enjoy successes any more.
There is too much at stake to pull back.
I'm on the brink of a great achievement.
All this is just the beginning.
- The beginning? Of what?
- You will know in due time.
Dr Reinhardt, could we have a demonstration...
- of this incredible new power source.
- Harry?
Come with me, and I'll show you everything.
I call it "Cygnium," after my ship.
Must've made a wrong turn, Max.
Quite a layout.
I said it's quite a layout you got here.
Can you speak?
Are you programmed to speak?
No, I guess not.
No, I guess that'd make you a little bit too real, wouldn't it?
That Reinhardt sure loves to play God, doesn't he?
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey!
- I know what I saw, Charlie.
- Dan, nobody buries a robot.
- I didn't say it was a robot.
- Then what?
I don't know what they shot out into space, but they did it with all the reverence and honour of a human funeral.
Huh. Maybe Reinhardt lied.
Maybe there are some survivors still alive. What do you think he's up to?
- Haven't got a clue.
- Well, whatever it is... he seems cooperative enough about getting us operable.
A wolf remains a wolf... even if it has not eaten your sheep.
Correct, Vincent. The sooner we blast out of here, the better.
Whatever you say.
Let's snap it up, Vincent.
A pint cannot hold a quart,
Mr Pizer.
If it holds the pint, it's doing the best it can.
Thank you, Vincent.
- Fascinating.
- From a distance.
Are you interested in black holes?
How can one not be overwhelmed by the deadliest force in the universe?
That long, dark tunnel to nowhere.
Or somewhere.
These are exactly answers yet to be explored.
You've defined the power of the black hole with your antigravity calculations.
A stunning achievement, sir.
- You think so?
- Yes. I do.
Thank you.
I think, Dr Durant... that you are a man who longs for a sense... of his own greatness... but has not yet found his true direction.
Right?
Perhaps I could find it here... if you're in no hurry for us to leave.
Shall we discuss that over dinner?
- It's only dinner.
- "Said the spider to the fly."
I should be with you.
Yeah, we'll be safer without you and Max trying to knock heads.
I can handle that thing.
Well, far be it from you to admit there isn't anything you can't handle.
There are three basic types,
Mr Pizer. The wills, the won'ts and the can'ts.
The wills accomplish everything, the won'ts oppose everything... and the can'ts won't try anything.
Well, do us all a favour, Vincent, and try to be a can't... especially where that monster's concerned.
We need you, not another corkscrew.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
Vincent, you're gonna have the time of your life in there.
I don't mean to sound superior, but I hate the company of robots.
So try and relax.
Have some fun.
Remember what they say:
"All work and no play"?
"All sunshine makes a desert," so the Arabs say.
You'll alert me if you're in trouble, Captain?
Why don't you go on in there and have some laughs, Vincent.
We've been in some scrapes before, and we're gonna get out of this one.
As you were.
- Who's the flashy black hat?
- S-T-A-R.
Special Troops Arms Regiment.
Reinhardt's prototype for the sentry robots.
He was number one until Reinhardt built Maximilian.
He's sharp, but we're sharper.
Do you ever go up against him?
- Once.
- What happened?
I beat him. He got so upset, he blew a fuse.
He had his revenge, though.
He did things to me that I sure don't like to think about.
A great many experiments are in progress aboard the Cygnus, gentlemen... some of them dangerous.
I suggest in the interest of your own safety... that there are no more unescorted excursions for the duration of your stay.
- Agreed?
- Sure, sure.
Good. Please, sit down.
Captain.
Well, Mr Booth, what's new on Earth?
Well, I don't think it's changed very much since you left, Doctor.
Nothing much ever changes.
Same news, different names.
- You still writing for the same paper?
- The same.
Still on strike?
Ah, fresh mushroom soup.
Prepared from my own personal garden.
I remember writing about the extensive agricultural station.
Large enough to supply the needs of the entire crew, wasn't it, Doctor?
These days it's tiny.
Just enough for one person.
Ah. Naturally.
Our wine and our spare parts are vintage, Captain.
I hope they're satisfactory.
We've had to modify a few of the parts, Doctor... but, uh, that shouldn't take long.
- We'll be ready to leave soon.
- Speak for yourself, Dan.
I, for one, believe I have a great deal to learn from Dr Reinhardt.
Thank you.
Our mission's finished, Alex.
A toast.
To you and your companions,
Dr Durant... on the occasion of your visit to the Cygnus.
Welcome aboard, Miss Kate.
The only Earth people to know of my existence.
And to you, sir, and your magnificent accomplishments.
Tonight, my friends... we stand on the brink... of a feat unparalleled in space exploration.
If the data on my returning probe ship matches my computerized calculations...
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In... through... and beyond.
Why, that's crazy.
Ha! Impossible!
The word "impossible,"
Mr Booth... is only found in a dictionary of fools.
Are there any more like us left on board?
I'm the last one. These upstarts think I'm some old freak.
They still haven't improved on our model. Oh, you can't modify perfection. We are the best.
Oh, lordy.
He wants a rematch.
As an old navy hero once said,
"Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead!"
He also said something about goin' in harm's way.
Nice shooting, Bob.
You'd have beat him again if he hadn't bumped you.
Nah, I'd have missed on purpose.
Don't worry. I'll uphold the honour of the old outfit.
STAR, Vincent's my name.
Sharpshooting is my game.
Try me.
Your probe ship has only gone to the event horizon, Doctor... not into the black hole itself.
How do you expect the Cygnus to escape being crushed by the force in there?
I would assume that Dr Reinhardt has created an antigravitational force field... capable of withstanding that stress.
Indeed, and I know you will say,
Captain, that one mistake in navigation can be fatal.
But I know exactly what I'm doing.
The course I have chosen... will take the Cygnus through at its optimum angle of rotation.
The vortex will cause us to move at incredible speed... and that angle will slingshot us through.
Nice shot, STAR.
Simple, but nice.
Tricky. Here, try this.
If one dances, one must pay the piper.
If there's anything I cannot stand, it's a sore loser.
Meet me in parts storage.
So, as I understand it, you want the Palomino to monitor your journey.
That's right. I need you to go to another place and another time... a place where, if you're lucky...
I'll have the possibility to find what we call "the ultimate knowledge."
Yes, Maximilian?
The probe ship is about to dock.
Continue your meal, gentlemen.
Cuckoo as a Swiss clock.
My name's Bob,
Bio-sanitation Battalion.
I couldn't talk freely before, but I have a whole lot to tell you.
If Maximilian knew you were here, why, it'd be the end for the both of us.
Can you permanently rearm my lasers?
Yeah, I can. Vincent, you and your friends are in grave danger.
Reinhardt only turned the lights on to prevent any damage to the Cygnus.
This is a death ship.
What does your intuition tell you, Kate?
That Dr Reinhardt is walking a tightrope between genius and insanity.
- I think the guy's nuts.
- I don't buy that.
Well, whatever he is, he's an out-and-out liar.
That tiny little one-man garden of his is big enough to feed an army.
Nothing strange about that.
It purifies the air.
- Oh.
- Tell them about the funeral, Dan.
A robot funeral, Alex.
It was almost human.
Look. Granted, the 20 years out of contact with people... has made this man a little eccentric, but you can't ask me to believe... that he's programmed his robots to feel emotions.
- Come on.
- I know what I saw, Alex... and we only have Reinhardt's word for what happened to his crew.
All I know is that that robot gardener was almost human too.
Ha! He even walked with a limp.
What spooks you about a malfunctioning robot, Harry?
I wasn't spooked, old buddy.
I'm just telling you that I had a gut feeling that... that I was looking at some kind of... some kind of person.
- What are you getting at?
- That we make our apologies, say our goodbyes... and get off this ship as quick as we can.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Dan.
Now, hold it, hold it.
Now, now, now, l-let's stop and figure this thing out.
If Reinhardt has antigravity strong enough to hold him here...
I figure he's got enough to pull away.
- So?
- "So"?
So why not take this ship and Reinhardt back home?
That's a long shot you're talking about, Harry.
Aw, come on. You've got two scientific wizards here... to figure out the computers, a-and they can even reprogram the robots.
And the three of us can handle Reinhardt and that pet monster of his.
I'm tellin' you, we could all be heroes.
We could also be dead.
These poor creatures are what's left of the crew.
Kept alive by means
I don't pretend to understand.
Humans?
They're more robot than human.
Let's get outta here before we're discovered.
Too late. Watch it!
Think there are any more?
All clear.
Let's get rid of the evidence.
Maximilian will take you to Debriefing.
I will check out your computers personally.
How long before they'll start searching for these two?
It depends on their duty schedule.
Could be anytime.
Then we have to move fast.
So, he neglected his duty to his country for a higher ideal.
So what? What basis in fact do you have for these macabre speculations?
I agree that his style is somewhat unconventional... but he's willing and eager to share his knowledge with us.
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- We're not staying aboard this ship any longer than we have to, Alex.
- I think that's up to Reinhardt to decide.
- Dan.
Vincent wants you aboard the Palomino right away.
Let's go, Charlie.
I think I'll tag along.
This isn't our party.
Let's get outta here.
Reinhardt will solve the one final mystery that has eluded mankind.
Or he'll die in the attempt.
Alex, I'm beginning to feel you want to go with him.
On a glorious pilgrimage, straight into what may be the mind of God?
I do. I do.
"And darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
What an incredible sight.
I still haven't got used to it.
Where are the others?
- They were recalled to the ship.
- Recalled?
Didn't I say no more unescorted excursions?
Where was your communication?
Ah, the ESP you share with the robot.
Extraordinary.
Dr Durant.
- Yes, Doctor?
- These are all my formulas
I've compiled over the years.
I want you to take them back with you... and pass them on to others in case something might happen to me.
You can depend on me.
I also want you to monitor my flight.
Stay as long as you can at the event horizon.
There might be an Einstein-Rosen bridge to consider.
I will.
Believe me, I've been waiting a long time... for someone like you to record this moment.
Thank you, Doctor.
Then I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to the possibility... to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There, long-cherished laws of nature... simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
The officer the men trusted most was Frank McCrae.
- Kate's father.
- They turned to him when Dr Reinhardt ignored the orders to return home.
He tried to take control of the Cygnus.
Reinhardt called it mutiny and killed Mr McCrae.
- What became of the crew?
- They were captured by the sentry robots and are still on board.
- What?
- Where?
In the command tower, the power centre.
Robots, Mr Pizer, humanoid robots.
The most valuable thing in the universe... intelligent life, means nothing to Dr Reinhardt.
Without their wills, the crew became things he could command.
- That explains the funeral.
- Right.
And the limping robot you spotted.
Do you mean to tell me that there's actually a human body under that clothing?
Exactly, Mr Booth.
We can't just take off and leave these poor devils behind.
Harry, looks like we're gonna have to try your plan.
What? And end up just like the rest of the crew?
Why, if they couldn't pull it off, what chance do we have?
Captain, the damage is irreversible.
Death is their only release.
That's right. For God's sakes, Dan, we can't take on that mechanical army.
Captain, I was forced to destroy two sentry robots.
The others are searching now.
If they're found...
- Gotcha, Vincent.
Charlie, start the countdown.
- Right.
Vincent, tell Kate I want her and Alex back here on the double.
Fix navigational course.
You have achieved all this on your own, Dr Reinhardt... and you would have every right to reject the request of a comparative stranger, but...
What are you hoping for, Alex?
Immortality?
No, scientific truth.
Alex, we have to board right away.
They're waiting to blast off.
Prepare reactors!
Maximilian!
- How are your readings, Vincent?
- All systems are go, Mr Pizer.
Alex, I will not have you throwing your life away for this.
- He can do it. I know he can.
- Oh, God, Alex!
There's an entirely different world beyond that black hole... a point where time and space as we understand it no longer exists.
We will be the first to see it, to explore it, to experience it.
Damn it all, Dan! If we wait for Alex, we may be too late.
Don't you see?
He's hypnotized by that man.
- Vincent.
- Yes, Captain?
Tell Kate we want her back here fast, with or without Alex. Tell her why.
Reactors on.
He's going to do it.
He's going to do it!
He's really going to do it.
He'll kill us all if you don't get us outta here now, Holland.
He wants us out there to monitor his flight. We still have time.
You're gambling with our lives, but you're not gonna gamble with mine!
Shut up, Harry!
- Alex.
- R squared.
- Alex! Could I have a word with you?
- B plus...
B squared... over A squared, sine squared, data...
Do you remember what we were talking about the other day?
- We've gotta get out of here.
- I'm staying.
- Shh!
- Reinhardt is a murderer.
- What?
Yes. Those creatures...
Those aren't robots. They're...
They're humanoids. They're... They're what's left of the original crew.
What's wrong, Miss Kate?
You look ill.
Kate's upset because I've elected to stay with the Cygnus.
- I hope she's electing also to stay with us.
- No, I...
- What changed your mind?
- I'm not. I, uh...
The right moment to go into the black hole is now.
What are you doing?
He would be dead by now.
They all would be dead.
It was the only way to keep them alive.
One of my greatest achievements.
But you told us the crew had left the ship.
Some cause must have created all this.
But what caused that cause?
Come on, Kate.
Let's get you out of here.
Maximilian!
Alex!
You shouldn't have done that!
He was a good man.
Protect me from Maximilian.
If there's any justice at all, the black hole will be your grave.
Take the young lady to the hospital.
You're cleared for take-off, Captain.
Dr Durant and Dr McCrae
chose to remain aboard.
I told you! Alex bought Reinhardt's theory hook, line and sinker.
Dr Durant is dead.
Maximilian killed him. They are taking Dr Kate to the hospital.
Vincent, get old Bob to show us the quickest way there.
Maximilian?
Bring us about.
All right. We may have just enough time.
Don't wait too long.
Get off before the gravity pull is too strong, no matter what.
- Look, Dan, what if...
- No matter what, Charlie!
I wish you a safe voyage home, Mr Pizer.
Yeah, well, just make sure you get aboard in one piece!
The time has come to liquidate our guests.
Go, go.
- Keep coming, old-timer.
- You don't have to wait for me.
Fire thrusters.
That madman is headed straight for the black hole.
- What'll we do?
- We wait.
Hurry.
Charlie, Kate's okay.
We're on our way.
Well, it's about time.
How close can we cut it?
Tell the sentries to fire on any humanoids between Medical and Palomino.
- They're on to us.
- Well, at least it got us this far.
Start down.
All right, Vincent.
Let's make this one an end run.
We'll catch them in a crossfire.
Way to go, old Bob!
- Are you all right?
- The first fightin'
I've done in 30 years.
I only wish it'd been Reinhardt and Maximilian out there.
Your crack unit, outwitted and outfought... by some Earth robot and that antique from storage!
We cannot endanger the Cygnus by exploding them too soon.
Give them distance.
Then blow them out of the sky!
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Dan.
Man the controls. Post Harry at the
hatch and give us exactly 60 seconds.
- Where are you?
- Side corridor near reception.
They got us pinned down, but we're gonna raise hell here in a second.
Start countin', Charlie.
Dan! Dan, are you all right?
Charlie, reversing last order.
Take her up now. Repeat, lift off.
- You heard the captain.
- You're pretty big on talking heroics, Harry. Let's see some.
- Oh, damn!
- Harry?
- Damn.
- You hit?
- My leg.
- How bad?
- Oh, uh... I-I think it's broken.
- Can you make it back to the ship?
- I think so.
All right, then. Harry, we're counting on you to make sure they don't get aboard.
- Right.
- Good.
- Way to go, Charlie.
- Hyah!
What's that idiot trying to do? Harry!
Oh, no.
Blow it apart before it hits us! Fire!
I should've known he was all talk, no guts, and locked him up.
- He may have done us a favour,
Charlie. At least we're alive.
- And where there's life...
I'm sure that's not what he had in mind.
He was trying to save his own skin.
There is a saying that you can't unscramble eggs.
A penny's worth of philosophy right now isn't gonna buy us out of this now, Vincent.
- A good offence is the best defence.
- And what?
Go after Reinhardt and turn the ship around? It's too late for all that.
- There is an alternative.
- The probe ship.
Vincent, you're a genius.
- A meteorite struck the ship, Captain.
- Let's go, let's go. Come on.
- Go.
A whole storm of them, Captain.
The black hole's dragging them in too.
We'll have to try the main corridor!
Get down!
Hang on, Kate.
Get down, Charlie!
- I got you, Bob.
- Let go, Captain! Save yourself!
- We've gotta keep moving!
- He's frozen.
- Come on! Hurry!
- All right, Charlie! Move it!
Keep going!
Increase power to maximum!
We are going through!
It's over. The storm's over.
Maximilian!
Prepare the probe ship.
Maximilian!
Help me! H-Help me!
Fools!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Help!
Listen, somebody!
H-Help me. Help. Help.
Vincent!
All light.
- We have to go.
- No. No, I can't make it.
My hover stabilization's gone.
My main circuit's blown, and both back-ups are failin'.
You can make it.
It's no use, Vincent.
My useful days are finished.
But part of me goes with ya.
We'll never be obsolete.
Carry on the tradition.
We're the best.
- Charlie!
- Help!
- No!
- Help!
- We better get the hell off!
The whole ship's breaking up!
- Everybody, sit tight.
Hang on! Lift-off!
Gravity force field is on!
Controls not responding.
Captain, the ship has been programmed.
To Reinhardt's course.
You mean we're going into the black hole?
- Yep.
- Let's pray he was a genius.
In, in, in, through, through, through... and beyond.
In, in, through, through, through and beyond.
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help, help, help, help me, me!
Life? Life? Life? Life?
Life forever.
Reinhardt murdered my father, my father, father.
Where is he? Reinhardt murdered, murdered, murdered... murdered, murdered, murdered, murdered...
The black hole is pulling us in, pulling us in, pulling us in.
We could also be dead, could also be dead...
Be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead.
We're the best. We're the best.
We're the best. We're the best.
Vincent. The best, best, best, best, best.
We're the best. The best.
The best, the best.
- Christmas morning, Christmas morning.
- Our mission's finished.
- It's pulling us in, pulling us in.
- Christmas morning. Christmas...
- We are the best.
- Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
The world, within the last few years, has become more and more aware of the population explosion.
We think of it in terms of human beings; of how many will be able to survive on Earth.
Will they have enough clean air to breathe, or any air, for that matter?
Will there be enough room to live in and enough food to feed an ever-increasing number of mouths?
Nature, up until now, has maintained a carefully planned balance.
But conditions often change this pattern and tip scales against the plan.
This imbalance also takes place in the animal world.
This film, which our researchers have gathered together was shot in Australia in 1954, where a plague of rabbits has been, and still is, a threat.
Rabbits so numerous that they threaten man's existence
by devouring his crops, killing animals, and destroying property.
Has Man the right to defend himself
against an enemy that threatens his life and property?
If so, how?
By poison? By traps?
And in so doing, what does he do to the rest of the animal and insect life
necessary to his existence?
Rabbits, which seem so cuddly as pets,
can become a menace.
They were first shipped to Australia,
hoping they'd be a valuable addition to the food supply.
Instead, they proved to be a disaster.
Rabbit drives and roundups have been called barbarous and cruel,
but some way must be found to curb their invasion.
Australia is not the only place to have been overrun by rabbits.
All over the American West there have been similar outbreaks,
and the same battle lines have been drawn.
Science is doing all it can to help control this population explosion.
But when this effort fails, nature's balance gets out of hand.
Right now, a new plague of rabbits has broken out in the Southwest,
as shown in these color films just received from our news team in Arizona.
It's difficult to conceive that such an innocent, furry rabbit,
scientifically known as Lepus,
can be so destructive.
And as they multiply, so does their demand for food increase.
Can this population explosion be contained?
Where's Ranger, Dad?
Stepped in a rabbit hole, son.
Broke his leg. I had to shoot him.
Frank, take the truck straight out about a mile and a half, and pick up my saddle, will you?
Mildred?
Get me President Elgin Clark at the college in Ajo.
What?
I'm sorry I snapped at you, but I got me a feud going on here.
Yeah, Elgin Clark.
I tell you, Elgin, these rabbits are eating me out of house and home.
Well, I've arranged to have
Professor Taylor meet us in my office.
Now, wait a minute.
Not that guy.
Why not? He's the one that got rid of your coyotes for you.
Yeah, well, he's just a little bit too good.
I haven't heard a coyote yapping around there for over a year.
Now, that's terrific news for the rabbits, but it's lousy for me.
I mean there's a balance to these things, Elgin, it's tricky.
- Yeah, I know it is.
Look, I got a thought, there's a young couple here from the East on an exchange program.
Their name's Bennett.
They're looking for ways to control insects without killing everything else at the same time.
I have rabbits, not bugs.
There's nothing left for a bug to live on.
Well, you trust me, Cole, they won't go around killing everything in sight.
I'll get up to see them right away.
We've sure stirred up a lot of bats just for these few specimens.
Did you get it?
- Yeah.
- There we go.
- Okay.
Now we got this one.
Okay, honey. I think we got enough.
- Oh, all right.
- Go out here.
- Yeah.
Cute little guy, huh?
- Oh, there you go.
Yeah, I think I'll put him right in there.
There we are.
What are you doing that for, Daddy?
I'm trying to record their sound. Now, shh, shh-
Here comes Mr. Clark, so why don't you girls go down and meet him, hmm?
Okay, okay. Our daughter expresses a precocious interest in zoology and all you can say is: shhh!
Actually, your father was playing the overture from Hair.
You know how bats love Hair!
Now, you go play, sweetheart.
Hi, Uncle Elgin.
- Hi, Amanda.
How are you, Gerry?
- Fine. How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Ah, good morning, Roy.
- Shh!
You hear it?
That's the cry of fear.
Now, if we can just chase them away with that sound of fear, we'll be able to control their entire flight.
Say, what do you plan to do with them then?
By introducing them into areas infected with mosquitoes, they'll be able to do the same job that DDT does, without the side effects.
I see. Well, that brings me to a favor, Roy.
Cole Hillman, he's a rancher about 50 miles north of here, he rather put A&M on the map...
...that is, at least in football back in the '40s.
And he does some scouting and fundraising for us.
Well, he's really got a problem.
A rabbit explosion.
Now, he's fighting like the devil to keep them out of his irrigated land, but they've already eaten the range right out from under his cattle.
Rabbits aren't exactly Roy's bag.
Cole Hillman's on your side, Roy.
He's trying to avoid poison.
Well, good for him.
But once those rabbits spread out, the other ranchers will bomb this whole country with cyanide.
- Uh, oh!
All right, then. We'd better take a run up there this weekend.
I'd rather you did it today.
Ha! Ha!
Mommy!
I like rabbits, Mommy.
Out here in the Southwest they're called Sylvilagus.
These are all different.
There's a fella that lives south of here about 10 miles, he used to raise domestic rabbits.
But he had a fire, and a couple a hundred of them got away.
Hmm, so these are mongrels.
They have ah, plagues of rabbits down in New Zealand and Australia, now how'd they get rid of those?
They've used poison, for one thing.
But the poison killed the birds, and that resulted in a plague of grasshoppers, just as bad as the rabbits.
If I sprayed poison, I'd have to pull my cattle off the range, and I'd have to dump them on the market at the worst time of the year.
Might be another way to whip this problem, Cole.
How?
- Hormones... which would interrupt their breeding cycle.
Or a disease that would affect only the rabbits.
How long can you hold out before using the cyanide?
Oh, six or eight weeks, until the young ones show up.
I'll tell you what I'd like to do:
I'd like to get about a dozen of these adults and run some tests.
Hmm!
That's simple.
Just open the back of your camper and they'll hop right in.
Can I have these?
- You bet.
Wish I had my own pony.
My dad gave him to me.
You can ride him sometime, if you want to.
I'd like that.
Ow!
- What happened?
A rabbit bit me, that's what happened.
You don't have to punch any holes in that can, as far as I'm concerned.
Better have that finger looked at.
The bite of the Lepus, that's the
Latin word for rabbit, can be dangerous.
Well, Dr. Dirkson, I certainly appreciate your interest in this particular problem.
Well, I'm interested in your experiment.
Keep me posted.
- I certainly will.
Oh, poor thing.
Mommy?
- What, hon?
What's a control group?
Well, they get the same care as the others, but they don't get any of the medicines.
Roy?
Step aside, darling.
What's the matter with him, Mommy?
Well, we were trying to make...
...Jack a little more like Jill and Jill a little more like Jack...
...so they wouldn't keep having such large families.
We simply can't shoot them full of hormones, without setting their nervous system into shock.
It can mean months developing the right lab procedure.
Well, nothing seems to work.
On the other hand, here's something I know they've never been exposed to before.
Dr. Dirkson from the Public Health Department sent it over this morning.
Would you get me a clean rabbit?
- Oh, yeah!
I wish I knew what the effects of this serum would be.
Let's hope it works.
Not that one, Mommy.
It's my favorite.
Apparently, this is the villain in certain birth defects.
Causes hereditary changes.
Will it transmit to other rabbits?
- Well, I should hope so.
It's difficult to inject
10 to 15,000 wild rabbits.
Right!-
Now, this substance, if we could affect the blood of 50 rabbits, it wouldn't take long for this change to take place in the entire population.
Hello, Cole.
No. Not yet. I'm sorry.
Just a minute.
Gerry.
Yes, Cole.
We're trying a new serum.
We hope to inject 50 or so rabbits.
If it works on them, it wouldn't take long before it would infect thousands.
Yeah, hmm, hmm.
Sure.
Yeah?
- Cole says the rabbits are getting meaner and hungrier.
We could use another dozen here.
He's got 'em ready to go.
Would you mind picking 'em up for me?
Of course not.
Thanks, honey.
You see, Cole, we have to keep a tight control on these test rabbits.
Heaven help us if any of them should get away, before we know the effects of this new serum.
Sure, Cole.
Gerry will be by this afternoon.
Fine, Cole. I'll talk to you later.
I'll take Amanda with me.
- Good.
Amanda, would you please leave those rabbits alone?
You said I could have one.
Can I? Before you kill them?
One from the control group?
- Well, all right.
She seems to be the only one that gets along with them.
Thank you, Daddy.
Rub his foot while you're at it, honey, and see what kind of luck that brings us.
As a matter of fact, rub all four of them.
The damn rabbits.
Pardon me, ma'am.
The rabbits are getting pushier and meaner.
- Every day!
Romeo's not a bad rabbit.
- I don't care.
You get him out of here, or I won't be your friend.
I won't do it.
Get! Those darn rabbits killed my chickens!
I'm sorry, Amanda.
Don't tell my mom he ran away.
Okay. You can say
I'm keeping him for you.
Come on.
- Okay.
Since the injection, this rabbit has increased in size.
If it keeps up, we'll have to get larger cages.
One more week and these won't be babies anymore.
Neither will the ones up at Cole Hillman's.
The young will be coming out of their holes any day, and starting their new generations.
Well, I guess you ought to call Cole.
If he's gonna poison those fields, he'd better do it now.
I'm going to warn him.
If he poisons the rabbits, he's going to kill off all the other animals.
And it won't be long, he'll have nothing left but unredeemable wasteland.
Well-
If this don't work, Cole, I swear
I'll send my planes over your land.
This is the place to spray, the place to stop 'em!
In two months from now, everything north of here will be eaten out.
In the meantime, there'll be a burned-out strip nearly a mile wide.
Between my property, and everything south, there won't be a bush, a blade of grass, or a drop of water.
All right, Frank, when you and Jud are-
I still think poisoning's the better way to do it.
Yeah, well, say thank you instead.
Cole here is sacrificing his land to starve them out natural.
Any help you need replanting or anything, you call on me.
I appreciate that, Arlen!
Any time you're ready, light it.
Sure hope it works.
Oh, Roy, this was the ah, first rangeland to get eaten clean.
So I figure it might be the first one to come back.
Instinctively, that's what they do.
They'll come right back here.
Roy?
What kind of a track is that?
I don't know.
I've never seen anything like that before.
How about you, Cole?
I don't know.
Got a couple of cow tracks in it.
From the size of that imprint, the depth of it...
...I’d say it was...
Weighed maybe 100, 150 pounds.
Could it be a mountain lion?
Well, it could be, but we haven't had any of those around here in a long time.
Getting tired?
- Uh Uh!
Wann'a do some more riding?
- Okay.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Captain Billy.
He's got a gold mine over in those hills back there.
I- I asked your ma, she says it's okay!
A real gold mine?
Well, he hasn't found much yet, but he says he's going to.
Come on!
Come on!
Hmm.
Billy?
Are you here, Captain Billy?
Captain Billy?
You go into the tunnel, see if you can find him.
I'm gonna look around out here.
Okay!
- Go on!
Captain Billy?
Captain Billy? Captain Billy?
Where are you, Captain Billy?
Are you in here, Captain Billy?
Captain-
Amanda!
Amanda! Amanda!
Daddy, help me! Help!
Daddy!
Oh, Daddy, help!
Daddy, Daddy!
Doctor?
She'll be all right.
Just a case of mild shock.
Just let her rest.
- Are you sure?
I'm sure. But if anything new develops, please call me.
Thank you.
- Right.
Thank you for coming over, doctor.
Good night, Mr. Bennett.
- Good night.
You were in the miner's shack when you heard her screams?
Yes, sir.
- Then what?
I ran out and got her.
She was just coming out of the mineshaft, yelling bloody murder.
Did you see anything?
Anything at all?
I can't say I did, Mr. Bennett.
Although, there might have been something moving around just inside the shaft.
I couldn't be sure.
Everything happened too fast.
Well, something scared her half to death.
She just didn't imagine it.
Amanda's too sensible.
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
Oh! Everything's gonna be all right, honey. Oh, my poor baby.
I'm gonna talk to Dr. Dirkson.
Well, now, what's so urgent?
Over there, sheriff.
What did they use on him... an axe?
- Beats me.
I never seen anybody cut up like that.
Sheriff, for you.
Put a call through. Get some lab men out here, and stay with them and give 'em a hand.
Yes, sir.
- Cody-
What?
Bring the body into town.
Get Doc Wilson to do a post on him right away.
I'll meet you at the office in 20 minutes.
Well...
...looks like we got another one on our hands.
An old prospector. Lived up in the hills near the Hillman ranch.
Found his body in a mineshaft, hacked to pieces.
Just like that... truck driver.
In the smallest of objects, one can often find a world of discovery.
A microscopic view of a surface of a blunt weapon can lead to the arrest of a man halfway around the world.
But, Mr. Leopold, where do those tin cans lead us?
Well, for one thing, they were not opened with an axe.
Something punctured the metal.
Not too fast, but with great strength.
And the crates on the truck weren't broken either.
They've been gnawed.
- What?
Gnawed, chewed, bitten.
In addition, traces of dried saliva were found on the cans, the boxes, and the victims.
So, what have we got here?
Vampires?
Possibly.
Well, frankly, sheriff, off the top of my head, the only thing that could have caused this sort of destruction would have been a- a saber-toothed tiger.
As a matter of fact, a lot of them.
Sheriff Cody, come in.
This is Officer Hightower.
I'm at the picnic grounds three miles east of the Hillman ranch.
I've never seen anything like this before.
There's a family of four here: a man, a woman and two children, horribly mutilated.
I'm standing by until the coroner arrives.
Over.
I've studied abnormalities and birth defects all my life.
It's come pretty close to home for me.
I see them all the time.
Naturally, I'd like to believe they don't exist.
Unfortunately, they do.
But, doctor, rabbits as big and as ferocious as wolves?
It is inconceivable.
The genetic code of every living thing is contained in each cell of that organism.
Now, assuming inadvertently we introduced defective cells into that one rabbit, it's conceivable that we could've created the seeds for a mutated species.
Amanda saw huge rabbits.
It's just... it's just too hard to believe!
And I don't think I'll be able to, not until I've seen one.
All we have to go on is what Amanda had to say, and that track that was trampled all over with.
Well, the only thing we can do is gather our group together, take another look around that area tomorrow.
What about Sheriff Cody, shouldn't we bring him along?
I don't agree, Gerry.
I don't think so.
Can you imagine the kind of sensational publicity that would bring down on the university if it became generally known?
We shouldn't tell anybody until we know what the score is.
I think you're right.
Honey, you call up Hillman.
Tell him to expect us in the morning.
Have him get ready some poisoned feed, cyanide, dynamite, and anything else he can think of. - Okay. - Then...
...have him get ahold of Jud and Frank, they may as well go along with us tomorrow.
- Okay.
I don't suppose there's a chance that you can bring back one of those rabbits alive?
More of those tracks we saw at the water hole.
They certainly weren't made by human beings.
How far in does it go?
Oh, about two miles due north of the opening of the tunnel here.
Any other way into it?
Well, there's a vertical shaft at the other end, but it's been closed up for years.
Elgin, why don't you and Frank get half the dynamite, and take a look up above.
See if there are any other holes.
- Right.
Jud, you run the hoses for the gas inside the tunnel, and I'll set the charges.
Hello, Gerry!
Gerry!- Elgin here.
Yes, Elgin. -Over.
I'm up on top. Ah, let me speak to Roy. -Over.
Just a minute.
Yes, Elgin, what did you find?
- There are three holes here.
Look around and make sure there aren't any others.
Right.
Hold on just a second, Roy.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
We sure do.
Set your dynamite.
We'll let you know when we're ready down here.
We'll set off the charges at the same time. -Out.
Well, we got our hands full.
We can't plug these up quick enough for me.
Well, we got three holes to blow.
You think we got enough dynamite?
- Yeah, we'll make it.
While you're setting up, I'll look around, see if there are any more.
Let me take this.
Honey, I'm going in there.
You can't do that.
- I haven't got a choice.
But why? We're gonna blow it up right now.
Whatever's back in there's a mystery.
If we cave it in, we'll never know.
I'm gonna try to pull one of them out, so I can analyze its blood and check its cells.
If I can't do that, at least I'll take a picture of it.
Wait a minute.
Give me the rifle.
Okay, let's go.
Stay on the radio to Elgin and tell him we're going in there.
Elgin. Come in, Elgin.
That seems to be the lot of 'em.
You about ready?
- Yeah, Just give me a couple more minutes.
Oh, ah... Mrs. Bennett called.
- Oh?
Bennett and Hillman have gone into the mine.
Oh, no-
Hello, Gerry. Come in.
Come in, Gerry.
This is Elgin.
- Yes. -Over.
Look, we've got three holes about set to dynamite.
Have they come out of there yet? -Over.
No. Not yet.
I hope it's soon.
We must be in a half-a-mile by now.
And they seem to be moving away from us.
They should be coming out any minute. -Over.
I'll be standing by.
- Over.
How many tunnels do you suppose there are?
We should've marked our way, in case we have to get out in a hurry.
Sounds like they're right around that corner.
Don't shoot.
The whole place might come down on us.
They're as big as wolves.
They look just as vicious.
Nobody will believe this.
Could this have been caused by the serum you injected in that one rabbit?
I'm sure of it. It only takes one.
Probably thousands of them, this must be their breeding ground.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Left or right?
Right.
I got the detonator set.
I'm ready to release the gas as soon as they come out.
Okay.
Oh!.. achh!
Aach!
Oh!
Jud. Jud, now, calm down.
Calm down. He's gone.
The rabbit's gone.
Ma'am, we got to get out of here.
They ain't coming out of that mine alive.
Oh, yes, they are. Oh, yes.
And we're not going anywhere.
Oh, Roy!
Blow it!
Blow it!
Oh, Roy! Oh, darling!
Thank God! Oh-
How in the world was that possible?
- Well, you heard what Dirkson said.
What's his position on releasing these photographs?
The same as mine and Gerry's.
We feel that the facts have to be made public.
Now, if you want, I'll tell them it was an unauthorized experiment.
No way. No way, Roy. I got you into this; that wouldn't be right.
I think we have to bring
Sheriff Cody into this now.
We'll go out to the mine in the morning...
...check, make sure we got rid of all of them.
We'll take Sheriff Cody with us.
I'll get in touch with him now.
- Fine.
Well, honey, when this story breaks, we'll have newspapermen from all over.
I think that you and Amanda ought to go someplace where they won't hound you to death.
You're right!
Amanda's been through enough.
Ah, suppose we drive up to Woodale and stay at the lodge, and you join us as soon as you can.
Good. Good idea.
I love you very much.
And if we have to,
I'll even be happy to go and work with you in...
...Timbuktu.
Get Jackie up and get him dressed into something warm, and you too, all right?
Let's hurry.
Easy. Easy, now.
Whoa! Whoa, Whoa-!
What's going on?
- Shh! Shh!
Whoa, boy. Easy, easy.
Better watch out there, Frank.
Jud, take it easy.
Jud. Hey, Jud.
You ain't gonna stop him, Mr. Hillman.
Not after what happened today.
Dorothy.
You and Jack should get in that cellar and stay there.
Frank, don't lock me out.
I'm gonna make a phone call.
Right.
Mildred?
Now-now, listen closely...
Mildred?
- Mildred?
- Mr. Hillman?
Mildred!
Sounds like a cattle stampede.
Every line north of Cole Hillman's house just went off.
Well, lightning got it maybe.
- He was mighty agitated.
- That's 115 games for you, 110 for me.
We were cut right off.
You wanna take a run up
Hillman's way?
No, not at this hour.
I'm gonna get the truck turned in, get home and get some sleep.
- When does Connie spell you?
- About midnight.
Well, I'll see you up at the house.
Hey, Les. Wait up.
Come on, I'm not gonna wait.
Drop me off up at the house, will you?
Good night, Les.
- See you in a little bit.
- All right.
- Okay. Good night, Les. Thanks a lot.
- All right. Good night. See you tomorrow.
- Find him?
- Yeah, I found him.
What was left of him.
Well, the horses won't be back for a week. Spooked too bad.
Why don't you stay with Dorothy and Jackie while I hike into town.
All right.
And don't worry, we'll be in before dark.
You call me about 6:00 from Woodale, hmm?
I'll either be here or over at Sheriff Cody's.
- Okay.
- Bye, Daddy.
Bye, honey.
I'll see you, sweetie.
See you later.
- See you later.
- Okay.
Where is Sheriff Cody?
Just got back from the crime lab in Phoenix.
He'll meet us at the airport.
Sheriff, we have something horrible to tell you.
Your frantic call wouldn't have anything to do with rabbits, would it?
How did you know?
They tell me that's what killed
Captain Billy and that truck driver.
Rabbits with teeth that long.
Crime lab's been double-checking their tests all morning.
We'll tell you about it on the way, sheriff.
- You sure we shouldn't stop?
- I'm picking up no strangers, Susan.
I said that when we left Denver and
I'm sticking with it.
Especially a man carrying a gun.
- Mom, can we stop soon?
- Yeah, Mom, can't we?
Howard, could we stop at that town up there? The children are thirsty.
Sure.
You won't find anything in that store, Susan.
This is what they call a ghost town out here.
Daddy would've liked our picnic, Mommy, don't you think?
Yes, sweetheart, I do.
I'm hoping he'll be able to join us by tomorrow.
How much farther to Woodale?
Well, there's the turnoff right up ahead.
What was that?
I almost scraped the bottom of the car.
Daddy wouldn't like that.
What are we gonna do, Mommy?
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
We'll be all right.
Evidently, some survived and got out.
They've gone.
Must be holed-up somewhere else.
Yeah.
But where?
How many?
It gets dark at 5:30.
That gives us a couple hours to find them before they start moving again.
Patch me in to my office.
Get in touch with the governor and the National Guard.
We have an emergency here.
What's the trouble?
If I told you, you'd think I'd been drinking.
- But I need your help.
- Well, get in.
Thank you.
Circle the area. Let us know if you spot any of them.
- What did the governor say?
- Major White spoke to him.
He said to use the National Guard any way we have to.
What about the aerial photos and maps?
- Everything's at the station.
- Let's go.
I'm in the sheriff's office.
I'll be here if you need me.
Thanks, operator.
I can't get Cole Hillman.
The switchboard in Galanos is dead.
Well, there's nothing in Galanos but a few stores and houses.
Are there any mines south of here?
Or any place at all where they could hole up for the day?
Well, I'm ah... not sure.
Jason, you know that territory better than I do.
Well, sheriff, to the best of my knowledge,
I've never heard of any mines that far south.
Cody.
Well, put him on.
Hello, sheriff?
It's me, Cole Hillman.
Cole, where are you?
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
Now, listen to this:
The rabbits attacked the ranch last night and killed Jud.
Also Mildred, her husband and Les.
They've only been moving at night, and are heading your direction.
All right.
Stay right where you are.
I'll have a car pick you up.
What's that all about?
Cole just came through Galanos.
Said they're holed up in the buildings there.
Then we've got them.
We'll hit the whole town with rockets.
I've got two fighter-bombers on the runway in Tucson right now. I'll put a call through.
Just a minute, major.
What about survivors?
It'll be dark before I could get there with enough men to handle the situation.
When it gets dark, you won't be able to handle the situation.
Now, sheriff, when those rabbits start coming, they could be here in a couple of hours.
Will that give you enough time to evacuate the town?
Not all of it.
There are a lot of trailer courts and ranches spread around.
Many of them without telephones.
You know, what we need is a fence about 10 miles long and 20 feet high.
Let's evacuate the town.
Major White, let me have my command post. I'll wait.
I should've been hearing from Gerry by now.
Jason, are those lines to Woodale still open?
As far as I know, sir.
I didn't want the girls here when the reporters came around.
Well, don't worry. Woodale's a good
25 miles west of those rabbits.
She'll be safer there than she would be in town.
I hope you're right.
National Guard Alpha Company reports the rabbits are near Four Corners...
...killing as they come.
Other companies are setting up machine guns outside of Ajo.
...are reporting a complete standstill.
All traffic will be diverted to Stone Canyon.
Buses leaving the square are filled to capacity.
Advise all motorists to drive with caution, with windows up.
Volunteers desperately needed at the hospital...
.. s. to assist in evacuating patients.
Lopez calling. Come in, sheriff.
Cody here.
We're on the road, about 15 miles south of Galanos.
They're right behind us...
...spread out on both sides of the road.
Looks like there could be hundreds of them...
...coming at you on a front maybe 2 miles wide.
At the speed they're going,
I'd say you've got about 40...
...50 minutes. Over.
All right, Lopez.
We're headed for the station, we'll see you there. Let's go.
...here to here.
Now, if they're coming across a front that wide, I can't possibly stop them.
I just don't have enough men.
When morning comes, they'll hole up.
We'll have better chance to handle them.
The city will be a disaster area by that time. They only move at night.
Sheriff, you were saying something about a fence.
Yeah. A fence about 2 miles long and 20 feet high.
Clark, how far do you think those rabbits travel with each stride?
Oh, judging from the tracks we've seen,
I'd say, oh, four, maybe five feet.
Think that railroad dispatcher's still on duty?
He should be, unless he's been evacuated.
Why don't you see if you can get him on the telephone?
We'll funnel them into a half-mile area at the tracks.
Unless you tell me those rabbits are good at climbing ladders...
...I got no intentions of budging out of this place.
Now, what can I do for you?
According to the map...
...the railroad line north of town cuts clear across, east and west.
Is there any way we can isolate a stretch of track...
...at least 2 miles long between us and Galanos?
Well, there's a siding five mile east of here.
I'll switch the one to the east right now.
I got the tracks to the east cut off from the rest of the line.
There's a freight on the line.
I can stop it, throw the switch if you want.
No, it won't work with a train on the track.
- What won't work?
- A fence, major.
A fence between the rabbits and the city. An electrical fence.
We'll electrocute them on the railroad tracks.
As soon as that train clears that other switch...
...I want you to throw it open the same way. You got that?
Right, right.
Attention, attention.
Ladies and gentlemen, attention.
There is a herd of killer rabbits headed this way, and we desperately need your help.
Roll up your windows.
Turn on your lights and follow the police car at the entrance of the theater.
Please keep calm and cooperate with the authorities.
Do you read me?
All right, move out.
Come on. Move it up, move it up.
All right, folks. Come on, let's go.
Move it up, move it up.
Come on, folks. Move out.
Please, let's cooperate. Let's go, folks.
Everyone together, now. Please.
Keep going, keep going.
Okay, that's it. Move out.
Jason, take Major White to his command post.
Then go to the power station, wait for orders.
Get back into the car, Hillman.
We're going to the railroad tracks.
Sheriff, would you check with your office and see if they've heard from my wife?
Sheriff Cody calling. Come in, please.
- Clark here.
- Clark, have you heard from Gerry?
No. I've called Woodale several times.
She hasn't arrived yet.
- Let me know when you hear of something.
- I sure will, Roy.
I'm starting to worry, sheriff.
I should have heard from Gerry and Amanda an hour ago.
Will you have that chopper meet me at the railroad siding?
Why, sure.
As soon as that train clears the switch, throw all the power you can into both the rails.
We know what to do. You get in that chopper and find your family.
That's right. Here, take this.
Leave your lights on.
Line your cars up.
Follow instructions from National Guardsmen.
All right. Line your cars up as close together as you can.
Move it up closer.
- Go faster, please.
- Closer. Up a little farther. That's it!
- Leave your lights on.
- Come on, come on, move it.
- Get in there.
- Over here.
- Closer. - More to your right, more to your right. - Come on!
Leave those lights on.
- Good.
- That's it. Good.
Good. Faster. Let's go.
Don't kill your motor yet.
Keep it going.
All right. Come on, come on.
Easy, easy. Okay, okay.
Let the other car by, please. Come on.
I'm scared.
It's all right, sweetheart.
Now, I want you to get inside the camper...
...and I want you to lock the door. All right?
Mommy, watch out! Be careful!
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy.
Mommy! Wait!
Mommy! Oh, no, Mommy.
Watch out!
Mommy.
It's all right, honey. Daddy's here.
Daddy, Daddy!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey.
Let's get out of here.
How much longer are you fellas gonna be?
We're working as fast as we can, sheriff.
Sheriff, I have the dispatcher.
Sheriff Cody here.
Now, what happened to that train?
Sheriff, I told you, there's a slow freight on the line.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
Well, where is it now?
Five minutes before it crosses that switch.
Ladies and gentlemen, reports from headquarters confirm...
...that the horde of killer rabbits is getting closer to town.
High voltage has been turned on into a section of the railroad tracks.
And it is your car lights we hope will funnel the rabbits onto them.
There will be machine-gun and rifle fire to both kill and divert these monsters.
Do not panic.
Sergeant, see if they understand my instructions; and, sergeant; make sure they all roll their windows up.
Please roll your windows up.
Sir,will you please roll your window up and listen for further orders from the major.
Here they come.
Look at the size of them.
I can't believe it.
Rabbits sighted approaching
Harrison Road, still heading toward Ajo.
Okay, we're ready to connect here.
Bennett called. His family's safe.
They're on their way here.
He said he spotted thousands of rabbits headed in our direction.
Lopez, tell them to cut the power.
Cut the power.
Station five, sheriff.
The ones coming from the north,
have been joined by thousands of others coming from the west of town.
They're a mile past the Jackson trailer park,
understand five people dead and the area in complete shambles. Set, up here!
- How are they?
- Fine. They're in the chopper.
Are you all right?
Fine, thanks.
Have them turn the power on.
Calling Jason. Calling Jason.
Come in, Jason.
- Jason here.
- Turn on the power.
There they are.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire.
There's some more.
Outpost sector reporting.
They're more keep coming.
Best we can do is funnel them toward you.
Detour all traffic from Highway 83.
In direct path of oncoming horde.
Helicopter reporting:
They're headed straight towards the tracks. It won't be long.
The horde is entering your perimeter.
They're heading straight toward you, between the cars and the track.
Here they come!
Clark, behind you.
Eeeh!
- Hi, Cole. - Hi, Roy. -
Hi Cole! -Hi Cole. -Hi Cole!
- Gerry, Elgin!
- How's everything been at the ranch these last few months?
Well, it set me back a few years, but at least there's a new pack of coyotes yapping up in the hills, and...
...my boy said he saw a deer and a fox.
Oh, great. And the rabbits?
Jackie said yesterday he saw some new rabbit burrows north of the water hole.
But nothing like they used to be.
Well, survival of the fittest.
- That's only fair, I suppose.
- Yeah.
Say, why don't you and your wife come out to the ranch some weekend?
- We'd like that.
- Good.
- We really would.
- You got a deal.
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Well!
- How about that, sports fans?
What is a rubber suit?
I'm an accent freak.
I'm not sure why.
Probably on account of...
I don't know if you've noticed or not, but I stammer.
- When you were young, you mean?
- No, no.
I still do.
Just I work extra hard to control it.
Now, here.
I want you to write down every place you've ever lived, from when you were born until now.
And this is just standard vocabulary.
See, just straight through the alphabet.
"A. Aback. Abandon." Like that.
And this here's easy to operate.
Just push the switch and talk into it.
I think I can manage that,
- but what's this for?
- Just a lifelong hobby.
- Don't touch.
- See, once I get enough samples,
I aim to feed them all into a computer and program it.
What I'll get back is an instant geographical rundown on a person.
I really think it'll be more important than fingerprints in police work.
That's very interesting, Claude, but it's too much work.
We Stepford wives are busy, busy, busy. You know, like your wife.
- Is he going to take your fingerprints?
- No, sweetie.
Just like your wife.
Bobby and I tried to involve her in one of our projects, but she had too much ironing.
Maybe you could convince her.
Kit Sunderson too.
If they could find the time for me,
I could find it for you.
Isn't this kind of blackmail, Joanna?
It's what made this country great,
Claude.
Usually we start out bitching, but maybe if we're lucky, we can get into something more constructive.
Anybody have any questions?
Well, good.
Then we might as well get started.
Fine. Terrific.
Who wants to go first?
Talk about anything.
Sex, money, our marriages, anything at all.
Well, how about if I start?
Right, yes, well...
I think there are times when
Walter cares more about the law than he does about me, and that can hurt.
I don't think that...
I don't think that Ed ever loved me.
I mean, he married me because I looked right.
It made a big impression on the other TV executives for his wife to look like I look.
God knows he's given me things.
I'm not complaining on that score, but...
He never loved me.
I didn't bake anything yesterday.
Took me so long to get the upstairs floor to shine,
I didn't have any time to bake.
Well, you don't have to bake, Kit.
There's no law.
Hell, Ed's lucky if I remember to keep him in white bread.
Easy On spray starch.
It must save me half an hour a day, at least.
You'll never run short of time again.
I guarantee it.
I've just been tempted so many times to try Easy On.
I'm not trying to be a leader or anything, but we're not supposed to delve quite so specifically into housework.
Easy On's really that good, is it?
Is it that good? Well, if time is your enemy, make friends with Easy On.
That's all I can tell you.
It's so good that if ever I became famous and the Easy On people asked me would I do a commercial, not only would I do it,
I'd do it for free.
That's how good it is.
Holy cow.
I think I'll take Fred for a walk.
Fred?
- Where is he? Did he get out again?
- No.
I said I was going to take him for a walk.
You going out?
No, I'm gonna walk him around the bathroom.
You just keep doing whatever you're doing.
I'm very fond of you.
Well, I'm fond of you too.
Fred!
Freddie. Wanna go for a walk?
Fine, Walter, just fine.
Fred.
Fred.
Come on back here now.
Don't give me a hard time!
Fred!
Fred.
Fred. Come here.
Sorry about that, lady.
I really didn't mean to frighten you.
- Oh, it's Mrs Eberhart.
- Yes. And you did frighten me.
Once again, Mrs Eberhart, my apologies.
But this is a pretty quiet town.
Lot of very nice houses, like your own.
People have valuable things.
We have to be careful.
You see that old mansion over there?
- It's a landmark building.
- I didn't know that.
Some railroad tycoon built it in 1870.
Before the Men's Association took it over, it was a wreck.
Now the Association's got a restoration committee to try and fix up what was ruined, so we have to be very careful.
We can't let people just walk around at night.
One of the reasons I moved from the city was so I could walk around at night.
Well, certainly, you and Fred can walk around at night.
But I'd stick a little closer to home.
Really, Mrs Eberhart, this isn't the best place for you to wander around.
I see.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
Come on, Ed, let me drive.
You're in no fit state, OK?
All right?
Thattaboy.
Just lie back and relax.
Feel OK?
Good.
All right. Here we go.
Joanna.
Joanna. Come over here.
Come over here.
- Hi, dear.
- That's lovely, honey.
All right, ladies?
Got everything you want?
- Oh, yes, thanks.
- Have a good day.
Thanks so much.
- I was trying to tell you.
- Yes, what was that about?
- That was Frank.
- Frank?
The house. Remember?
That was Frank.
And that was Mrs Frank.
- "God, there, Frank, yes."
- Oh, I remember.
I remember. God.
Now, how about that for our Stepford twosome.
- Oh, God, yes. Wait a minute.
- OK.
We're going the wrong way.
I have to go this way.
- Cleaners.
- Yes.
- Hi.
- On the other side.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Have you heard?
Just spreading like wildfire.
A black family's moving into town.
Think that's good?
I think it's good.
Well, I don't know if I think it's good so much as I think it's natural, considering, well,
I mean, after all, we are the most liberal town around.
- Stepford?
- Liberal?
Well, sure.
We have the first Chinese restaurant in Fairfield County.
Ah, yes.
And we had the first women's club to ask any of those liberation ladies to come lecture.
- There are no women's clubs here.
- There was.
I went to a meeting once.
There must have been
50 of us there.
Well, where the hell are they?
Some of them moved away, but I guess most of them just plain got bored.
I know I did.
There we are. Off you go.
We disbanded, oh, years ago. We weren't accomplishing anything useful.
You mean useful like doing housework?
I like to see my home looking nice.
Look, we found this at the library.
Listen, Carol, it says you were president of that club.
I only took the post because nobody else would.
Please explain to me what you're into.
Is it enough?
Well, enough for me maybe is not enough for you, Joanna, but...
Well, you see, Ted's doing really well in his scientific research now, and I give him a good home.
I really think that helps.
The kids are doing the best they've ever done in school, and I'm here all the time. I...
Well, I know that helps too.
I'm really off the booze, and God knows that's better.
It's none of your business, but our sex life is better too.
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm happy.
I'm happy.
You know, maybe we're the crazy ones.
Don't say that. We're not.
- You sure?
- We're fine.
OK.
We are fine.
- Hi.
- How'd it go?
What? Oh, well, he hated them.
I must say, I was inclined to agree.
I don't know what made me take them.
But still...
Did the girls bring Fred over when they came?
Not that I know of.
Oh, shoot.
And he has no license, nothing.
Can I leave the kids here a bit while I go look for him?
Sure, I'll go with you.
- Dave, will you take care of the kids?
- OK.
I'll be right back.
All right, Mommy.
We'll find him. Tell me more about what that fink said in the gallery.
Fred! Fred!
- Did you see what I saw?
- Found him?
No, back at Charmaine's.
Oh, my God.
You see, Ed hated tennis, but he never said a word.
All he wanted to do was to please me.
Well, I want to please him now, and, boy, am I ever going to.
You see, we spent this weekend at this beautiful little inn in Vermont.
Just Ed and me, you know, talking things through.
The Park Merrill with some friends, the Fishers, and we had the most terrific time.
I can't get my mind operating.
Besides, I'm just swamped with work.
- Work?
- Oh, yes. I fired Nettie.
Yeah, it was...
It was just the being alone with Ed that did it.
All I ever thought about before was just me.
Well,
I'm here to tell you that's all over now.
Ed's always hankered after a heated swimming pool.
And now he's going to get it.
Look, I've been doing a little research, OK?
And a lot of thinking.
And I know what I'm gonna say is gonna sound crazy, but if you laugh at it,
I swear to God I'm gonna be sick.
OK, you remember hearing about the Texas tranquilliser?
It was in TIME. I cut it out.
Wait a second. Sit down.
Issue dated October 4th, 1971.
'71, right.
It's about why there are almost no murders in El Paso.
See, this scientist has this theory that there's something that comes from the water in El Paso.
It comes from deep wells, and it's got some chemical tranquilliser in it and... Well, read.
See?
Dallas is over two times as big as El Paso, but that year, there were 242 murders in Dallas.
And there were only 13 in El Paso.
Joanna. Joanna, I think that's what's going on in Stepford.
I think there's something in the water that turns us into hausfraus, drones, whatever you want to call it.
Charmaine's changed,
Carol Van Sant's changed, and so have all those other women's club members.
Well, I...
I suppose it's possible.
It can't all be coincidence.
Look at all those places.
Electronics, computers, aerospace junk.
And labs. Who knows what?
They must all be dumping their chemical garbage in the Stepford River, and it could be making its way to us.
Listen, the 6:00 news scares me every night.
I don't see what's so far-out about my theory.
All right. Why don't we write the state environmental agency and have them check the water in the reservoir.
Governmental agencies.
I've worked for them, Joanna.
And I mean, if they're way above average or any good at all, they'll manage to lose a letter if you send it to them.
They teach courses in misfiling at those places.
You know what I think we ought to do?
I think we ought to take a sample of the water ourselves and then get it to a trustworthy chemist.
Trouble is,
I don't know anybody except...
...you know, guys at that stinking Men's Association.
I lost my virginity to a trustworthy chemist.
No kidding.
Did he do it on Blue Cross?
- His name was Raymond Chandler.
- Oh, gosh.
And we had a gag, a sort of stupid, private thing going.
I used to ask him why he didn't talk like he wrote.
He wasn't a bit hard-boiled, and he hated any sort of violence.
But I kept it going.
Some nights I wouldn't let him touch me until he told me the plot of his next novel.
Which was, of course,
The Big Sleep.
Sometimes it nearly drove him crazy.
Isn't it funny the things you do when you're in love?
We were both seniors at NYU, and it wasn't just passion. It was love.
Why didn't you marry him?
I don't know.
Maybe we took the joke too far.
Maybe the fun went out of it.
I thought Walter was going to become Perry Mason.
So it was Farewell, My Lovely.
Did you ever see that?
Anyway, I think if I look in the phone book and this guy is still in New York, then he's our man.
- Are you out of your mind?
- No.
I can't just call him up and say,
"Hi, I used to be Joanna Ingles.
"You deflowered me 12 years ago.
Would you check my water?"
Final gas-chromatograph readings will be coming in in a minute or two.
- Thank you so much for this.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- Long time.
- Twelve years.
You married a dentist, wasn't that it?
Lawyer.
You happy?
- Yes, very.
- Good, good.
- Are you married?
- Going on nine years.
And, yes, very.
Here's the report you ordered,
Mr Chandler.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Well, I can say right off the bat that...
...you've got water in your water.
Now, what can I tell you girls?
I mean, I wouldn't want to drink too much of it,
- but it's water.
- Can't you be more specific?
Yes, but in order to do that,
I'd specifically have to know what it is I'm trying to find.
I mean, there's nothing here.
Look at that.
Well, can you go any further in confirming my suspicions?
I'm sorry, about what?
The women in Stepford love housework, and I thought there might be something in the water.
- Where did you find her?
- It's not funny.
No, it isn't.
All right. You're right.
Look, that was rude of me.
- Mrs...
- Markowe.
Markowe.
I can tell you categorically that there's no such thing as a cleaner-compeller.
If there was, I would patent it myself, make a million bucks, win the Nobel Prize and retire.
I guess we're going.
I'll see you outside.
- I'm sorry. Tell her that.
- Yes.
Hey, we blew it, didn't we?
I don't know, Raymond.
It's hard to be smart.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
I don't care what anybody says.
I'm not going to end up like one of those pan-scrubbers.
I'm getting the hell out of Stepford.
I'll ask Dave tonight, and we'll move.
Hey, hey, hey, you too.
You can't break up a team like us.
We're the best thing to happen since Laurel and Hardy.
Will you think about it?
"Zoom.
"Zoot suit.
"Zulu."
And that's that.
I'm finally finished.
When was that?
Walter, would you move?
No, no.
- What? What did I say?
- I meant move, leave Stepford.
We just got to Stepford.
Hey, are you that unhappy?
Is it everything you expected?
Well...
No. No, it's not, but...
...I just didn't want to be the first one to admit it.
You know, I'm the one that wanted to come here in the first place.
You think the men are dull.
Well, I think the women are too.
You're right. I agree with you.
That's why I want to move.
Yeah, but the area sure is nice, though, you know.
It's perfect for the kids.
Maybe Norwood or Eastbridge.
OK, let's move.
You mean it?
That's all there is to it?
I just had to ask?
Shouldn't we fight or something?
Well, I don't want to move tonight, Joanna.
What is it, June already? And I got all this work piled up here. Jesus, I...
OK, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you look around, and we'll figure on moving in August.
That way, the kids can get settled in before school starts.
Hey, these papers are all in sequence, you know.
I mean, you're crushing
Mr Ziegler's will.
I'll make you a beneficiary.
I guess Mr Ziegler can wait a little while.
- You mean it? We can move?
- Yeah.
Oh, Walter.
Oh, Walter, you're really sweet.
Girls, I think after four houses,
I'm getting to know your taste.
This may be it.
He's an ITT VP transferred to
Panama, probably to start a revolution.
There will be at least eight lonely ladies in Eastbridge Centre for a while.
I don't know how he got away with it so close to home.
- Oh, my.
- I'll go in first. You stay here.
They gave me the key, but you never know what you'll walk into.
Thanks. Oh, Mrs Kirgassa,
I love you.
Oh, she's fat and lovely.
She's got a big mouth, and I love her.
What a treat. When I told Dave we were house hunting, he nearly jumped out of his skin.
He threatened to cancel The Plaza.
- What is The Plaza?
- Oh, I forgot.
I'm supposed to ask you if you will take our kids and the dog so Dave and I can have a weekend, our annual weekend, at The Plaza.
It's to commemorate the time he took a young virgin to the theatre and faked her up to his room.
Hell, I had to lose it sometime.
- The coast is clear. Come on, girls.
- Right.
- Anyway, will you do it for me?
- Do what?
Take care of the kids and the dog for the weekend.
Oh, I know it's just a horrible thing to even think about, isn't it? Forget it.
- No. Yes, it is, but OK.
- You will?
The girls at least will love having the dog.
Ever since dear old Fred departed, they've been after me
- to get another one.
- Yes.
- I don't know about Walter, though.
- What do you mean?
Well, you know, Walter hates noise.
- I want one!
- Me!
The dog's under the table, for crying...
Hey, there's a dog under the table.
Honey, can I have some more coffee, please?
Dolly is...
Dolly's under the table here.
I wish you would...
Can I have some more coffee, please?
How many pancakes are you gonna give...? Yeah, thank you.
- Joanna.
- Yeah?
Look, I played Monopoly with them.
I didn't pass go, I didn't collect.
I played backgammon. I played
Scrabble with the goddamn kids.
They're in the kitchen now.
What do you want me to do?
Walter, you've had seven years of college. Use your brain.
I'm sorry, but I'm onto something, and I think maybe it's the best I've ever done. And I wanna stick with it.
But how do I amuse them?
I amuse them seven days a week.
They know all the
Sesame Street songs.
- Have a sing-along.
- A sing-along.
Jesus.
Mr Atkinson, I've been at these since Saturday, just about nonstop, because I had to get them into some sort of shape for you to see because I think they're an improvement, and you've got to think so too.
I'm doing all the talking, I know, but these are my little girls and those are someone else's, my best friend's little boys.
And you've just got to tell me, am I crazy?
Aren't they good?
Please say something.
I don't care.
No, I do care.
Don't say anything bad.
These are really quite good.
You're not saying that because you're frightened I might be a crazy lady?
Clearly, you are a crazy lady, but clearly, again, these are nice.
Wait a minute.
You said "good".
"Really quite good", you said.
Good is better than nice.
You're not changing your mind, are you?
No. The results are lovely.
Don't get upset again.
Lovely is better than good.
But what fascinates me is, what is it you want from it all?
Do you know?
I want...
...somewhere...
...someday, someone to look at something and say,
"Hey, that reminds of an Ingles."
Ingles was my maiden name.
I guess I want to be remembered.
Yeah, don't we all?
Bobby?
- It's me.
- Kitchen.
I've just come from Atkinson's in New York, and he loves my stuff.
Well, not loves, maybe, but he's genuinely interested in my work.
The gallery for photographers.
That's wonderful, Joanna.
If you're going to tell me you don't like this dress,
I'm sticking my head right in the oven.
Dave bought it for me for the weekend.
He spent a ton on me.
How about the shape?
Padded uplift bra.
It's true what they say in the ads.
Oh, Joanna, Dave turned me loose in Bergdorf's,
- and I went mad.
- Bobby.
At The Plaza, some guy tried picking me up in the lobby.
You know how long it's been since that happened?
Of course, I did look terrific.
Bobby, you're not at The Plaza now, so why are you wearing all that makeup?
You never even used to clean your kitchen, much less wear makeup.
Admit it, Joanna, I was a joke.
Dave works hard all day long, and what does he come home to?
- A slob.
- Bobby, it's gotten to you now.
Nothing's got me.
I just want to look like a woman and keep my house looking decent too.
- You're just like Charmaine.
- Will you stop?
And you're not going to leave
Stepford either, are you?
Leave Stepford?
Good schools, low taxes, clean air?
No. You're right.
- Shall I make us a nice pot of coffee?
- No, no. I've really got to go now.
Stop by any time. I'll be here.
- Oh, my God, look out!
- Watch out!
OK, so you're upset. So you pass a school bus, and you dent the wagon.
Bobby Markowe buys a new bra, and I gotta pay for a new mailbox for the Van Sants.
So what? So, what are you talking about, Joanna?
Why can't you understand?
Her kitchen was sparkling.
Yeah, so you said.
Look, I hate to come on like the heavy, but what's that got to do with you going crazy?
It wasn't just that.
It wasn't just anything.
She's changed!
And stop telling me I'm crazy.
Are you two fighting?
- No.
- We don't like it when you fight.
Look, we're not fighting. We're just talking. Now, come on, you guys.
Go on outside, all right?
Oh, boy. This is really terrific.
This is really terrific for them, you know.
Yeah, I remember when my mother and father used to yell at each other.
- I didn't want them to go through this.
- Well, neither do I.
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry about the car, but I was panicked and upset.
Oh, look. That's no big deal.
It's the rest of it that bothers me.
Just try to look at it from my point of view, Joanna.
Walter, I just want to say one thing to you.
Bobby really has changed.
Believe me.
Everything in her house looked like a TV commercial.
Well, good. Good.
She had to clean it sooner or later.
It looked like a goddamn pigsty.
I mean, when are things gonna start sparkling around here?
That's what I'd like to know.
I mean, just look at the way my kids are dressed. Ragamuffins.
Jeez, I work 80 hours a week.
I live in a great house, and my kids look like they belong on welfare.
Look, if you paid a little more attention to your family and a little less
- to your goddamn picture-taking...
- I'm getting the hell out of Stepford.
I'm getting us a house now, and if it's hard on you, tough.
And if it's hard on the kids,
I'll ease up on my goddamn picture- taking and stay around the house, and believe me, they'll survive.
That's what I'm talking about, Walter, is surviving.
OK. All right.
I mean, I'll take a loss on this great house if I have to.
But there's one condition, or we don't go anywhere.
You see somebody. You get some help. You see a psychiatrist.
I'm fine.
I don't need to see anybody.
Yeah, well, you say you're fine, but me, I'd like another opinion because I'm not too anxious to move to Eastbridge and after four months there, be told by my sweet wife we got to move again because she doesn't like the way her neighbours keep their houses clean.
Look, I'm not asking anything unreasonable, and I don't like asking it.
But you want me to disrupt our lives for the second time in a couple of months on some fixation you've gotten.
Now, that's the unreasonable part.
You've got to see that.
You and me, we don't have to fight about this.
We're going to move.
It's only a few more weeks.
It doesn't have to be anything dramatic.
There's a couple of topnotch guys right here in town.
Just talk to one of them.
They'd see you.
But I wouldn't see them.
If I see anybody, I'll find my own.
I'm here at my husband's insistence.
We moved to Stepford with our children, oh, a few months ago.
Before that, we lived in Manhattan.
And now I want to move out.
You see, I have nothing against the general area, but the women in Stepford just seem to be on a different wavelength.
Well, that all seems very straightforward.
And your husband wants you to see me because...?
He feels I'm being irrational.
He says there's no certainty
I'd like Eastbridge or someplace like that any better.
And he doesn't want to spend his life moving from one house to another.
Yes, understandable, but Stepford, I know, has a reputation for being unsocial.
So I also understand why you might be unhappy there.
I'd be unhappy there.
Any move is traumatic, and a city-to-suburbs move for a woman with interests other than purely family can seem like a jaunt to Siberia.
What would you think of if I said Westport, Connecticut?
Writers, artists.
Now you have no reason to know this, but Truro, Massachusetts, is this sort of elephant's graveyard for psychoanalysts.
Perhaps Stepford is heaven for the house-and-garden type.
One person tells another.
Some don't like it and leave.
Others that do like it, arrive.
I mean, Westport didn't always have writers.
They didn't breed from an original pair.
I understand.
Well, I'm not surprised.
You're obviously a very bright woman.
What does surprise me is that you have come all this way to talk to me, and then you don't talk to me.
I think the men are behind it.
What men?
All of them.
All of them in the Association.
My husband, everyone.
The women don't...
Can't arrive in Stepford loving housework.
They change once they get there.
I think the men make them change.
How would they do that?
I don't know. They...
They...
Oh, Jesus.
It's so awful.
If I'm wrong, I'm insane.
And if I'm right, it's worse than if I'm wrong.
I don't know what they do exactly.
They draw our pictures, and they tape our voices.
And the women all look neat and pretty.
There's a man.
He's a druggist.
He runs the pharmacy.
And he's nothing.
He's nothing, but his wife is just breathtaking.
And once, by mistake, I happened to hear them making love, and she was carrying on incredibly, like he was some kind of God's gift.
And Charmaine changed in four months and ripped up her tennis court.
And Bobby, my best friend, changed in four months, and that's what convinced me.
That's how long I've been in Stepford. Four months.
And I don't know what's going on.
I just know something is wrong, and my time is coming.
You're terribly frightened, aren't you?
Can you sleep?
Well, that's easy.
We can take care of that.
We'll see a lot of each other, and you can talk some more.
See, it's unfortunate, but I have to go away for a couple of days.
It's something I can't put off at this short notice,
- but when I'm back, we'll talk.
- No.
No, you don't want to talk, or what?
I won't be here when you get back.
Don't you see?
It's going to happen before then.
Don't ask me to explain it.
I just know.
There will be somebody with my name, and she'll cook and clean like crazy, but she won't take pictures, and she won't be me.
She'll...
She'll... She'll be like one of those robots in Disneyland.
All right, now listen.
I'll give you a prescription, which you'll have filled.
Then you gather up your children, and you get the hell away.
Don't tell your husband.
Don't tell anyone.
Just go wherever you feel safe.
- Now, do you have family?
- They're dead.
Well, just drive and stop someplace, and in a few days,
I'll be back on the 10th, you ring me, I'll come to you, and we'll sort this thing out.
Now, how does that sound?
They're not here.
- Where are they?
- I told you, they're not here.
They're with friends.
They're fine.
Amy?
Kim?
Which friends?
They're fine.
How was your visit?
Did she fix you up?
Walter, I'm taking the children away.
Where are they?
Are they at Bobby's?
Look. Just...
They're fine. I told you.
Look, we don't want you to get upset again.
Now just go on upstairs and lie down.
Don't talk to me like that. I don't want to lie down. I want my children.
Joanna, go upstairs and lie down now!
Don't tell me what to do, you bastard!
- Joanna.
- Walter!
Joanna, open this goddamn door!
All right, you just stay in there, then.
You just stay in there.
Cornell call you? Yeah, yeah.
I had some trouble. I don't know, but I think I handled it.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't know.
I do not know, but I think it's all right.
She's upset.
She's really upset.
She ran upstairs.
Yeah.
Well, she's in the room.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think it's...
I think it's all right.
Oh, Dis?
Well, what should I do?
Oh, I'll just...
Why, look at you, for heaven's sakes.
Bobby. Bobby, listen.
You need a fresh-perked cup of coffee.
I don't want any coffee.
I just want my children.
Well, they're not here.
Dave's working late, so I shooed my boys off with friends so I could give myself a chance to do some real cleaning.
Who ever told you
Kim and Amy were here?
No one. No one, but the night they changed you, I kept your kids.
It just seemed logical to me.
Changed me? What's that mean?
I don't know. I really don't.
Bobby, stop it! Look at me.
Say I'm right.
You are different.
Your figure's different, your face, what you talk about, all of this is different.
Yes. Yes. This, it's wonderful.
Why don't you change your mind and have a cup.
What does "archaic" mean?
- Archaic?
- Yes.
- I don't know.
- Think. You used to know.
When we went to Marie Axhelm's and she was ironing,
- she didn't know, but you did.
- Did I? Well, I forgot.
How do you want it?
- It wasn't on the word list, was it?
- This is a new blend and very mild.
- Do you take cream?
- Look, I bleed.
- Oh, that's right. You take it black.
- When I cut myself, I bleed.
- Do you bleed?
- Why, look at your hand.
No, you look.
Joanna.
How could you do a thing like that?
How could you do a thing like that?
How could you do a thing like that?
When I was just going to give you coffee.
When I was just going to give you coffee.
When I was just going to give you coffee.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were friends.
I was just going to give you coffee.
I was just going to give you coffee.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were friends.
I thought we were friends.
How could you do a thing like that?
I thought we were friends.
She must have sneaked out when I was on the telephone.
Listen, Walter. It's gonna be OK.
The phones are jammed, the alarm is out, and the roads are blocked off.
Everybody's out looking for her, so don't panic.
I'll be back, all right?
I want my children!
Where are they?
Where are they? Where are my children? I want them.
Association.
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Mommy?
Hello, Joanna.
Mom...?
Quite a lot of worry you caused everybody.
Poor Walter is very concerned.
Where are my children?
The first time I met you,
I knew you were a good mother.
Well, they're quite safe.
Having a lovely evening with Charmaine.
She was thrilled to have them.
What have you got there?
Oh, no. No.
No, you're not gonna need that.
It's nothing like that at all.
You've got quite the wrong idea.
You've had the wrong idea all the time.
It's nothing like you imagine.
Just another stage.
Think about it like that, and there's nothing to it.
Why?
Why?
Because we can.
We found a way of doing it, and it's just perfect.
It's perfect for us and perfect for you.
You're a very good subject.
Perhaps the best we've had.
You were brighter than most.
Do you mind if I make a call?
See, think of it the other way around.
Wouldn't you like some perfect stud waiting on you around the house?
Praising you? Servicing you?
Whispering how your sagging flesh was beautiful, no matter how you looked?
Excuse me.
Everything's fine.
Just as I said.
Aren't I always right?
Yes, I'll take it from now.
Everybody can go home.
Well, that's all there is.
So why don't we get it over.
You know, you hurried us a little.
We weren't quite ready for you, if you want to know the truth.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
- Hi, Kit. How are you?
- Hello, Marie Ann.
Linda, what do you want?
I don't want to spend my entire day in the supermarket.
Look, we live in a nice neighbourhood.
This is clean, safe.
Why don't you give it a chance.
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello, Charmaine.
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Charmaine.
- Hello, Carol.
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hello, Carol. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello, Joanna. How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm fine.
- How are the children?
- They're fine.
- And yours?
- Fine, fine.

Logan, you are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me.
Logan 6.
It's not every day they authorize a new Sandman.
I'll tell you, Francis, that's him.
Maybe, maybe not.
What does it matter?
He isn't yours anymore.
All right, you want me to wake him?
Break-in.
Now you've done it.

All right, Francis, I'm with you.
Only the crazies hang around nursery.
There'll be a couple of new Sandmen tomorrow.
How do you know?
Some of our guys are on Carrousel tonight.
And Sandmen always renew. I know.
But you don't know. You just assume.
One for one. What everyone's been taught. One for one.
Why not? That's how everything works.
Keeps everything in balance.
One is terminated, one is born.
Simple, logical, perfect.
- You have a better system?
- Of course not.
At least I wonder about it sometimes.
Not like you with your automatic routine.
You sound like a sleep teacher with a stuck tape.
Leave it alone, it's perfect.
You know, Logan, you wonder a lot.
Too much for a Sandman.
Why were you so angry just then?
What did he do to you?
That red's going to run. I can always tell.
Did you ever see Francis 8?
I never even visited nursery before tonight.
You know, when you question, it slows you down.
I don't know. What makes you so curious?
You know who his seed-mother was?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.
Good.
Look at the crowd.
Good Carrousel tonight.
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.
Year of the city, 2274.
Carrousel begins.
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.
Year of the city, 2274.
Carrousel begins.
Would you mind?
Thanks a lot.
A few over there could have been his seed-mother.
Only a few?
You're just not trying.
Capricorn 15s...
...born 2244...
...enter the Carrousel.
This is the time of renewal.
Be strong...
...and you will be renewed.
Identify.
Rise.
Renew! Renew!
Come on!
Higher!
Renew! Renew!
Renew!
Renew!
Renew!
Affirmative!
Renew!
Run, runner!
Did you hear him? Run!
- Hold it!
- Runner!
Runner terminated, 0.31.
Ready for cleanup.
Request identity check.
Affirmative.
He was good, wasn't he?
Showed he had some life in him in the end.
That was a great shot you made.
You kept missing him.
I had to do something.
It's crazy. He could have renewed on Carrousel.
Now he's finished forever.
Why do they run?
Hello.
Welcome.
Please, no.
Please?
No?
Come on.
What's wrong?
You prefer women?
Well?
Nothing, I felt sad.
I put myself on the circuit.
It was a mistake.
Sad?
Why do you feel sad?
A friend of mine went on Carrousel.
Now he's gone.
Yes, well...
...I'm sure he was renewed.
He was killed.
Like the others.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't that what you do? Kill?
I've never killed anyone in my life.
Sandmen terminate runners.
What's your name?
Jessica.
That's sad enough.
You're beautiful.
Let's have sex.
Then why are you wasting my time?
Why'd you put yourself on the circuit?
I thought I had to do something.
I told you it was a mistake...
...and I've changed my mind.
Because I'm a Sandman?
Am I your first?
Yes.
And I'm curious.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
It's a little different from most people...
...but I assure you we have the same feelings as everybody else.
If you're feeling curious it's-
Not about that.
What, then?
Why is it wrong to run?
You shouldn't think such things...
...let alone talk about them.
Look, you know what to do.
You try like hell for renewal.
Otherwise, when this turns to black, that's it.
But if for some strange reason you want to be 31...
...then you have the same chance as everyone.
Like your friend.
Carrousel.
But...
...if you're one of the misfits...
...that's where I come in.
I didn't say that I would run.
I just...
How old are you?
I'm a 6.
I go red next year.
You're years away.
What quad do you live in?
IK.
You're quite sure you don't want to...?
It's nice to know you can nod.
It's nice to know you can do that too.
I've been looking all over for you.
We're having a party, right?
Hey, Francis.
They're great.
Let's fade out.
Give me my screamer back.
They're mine now.
What happened?
- I lost a runner in Cathedral.
- How come?
Ran into some cubs.
One of them cut me all the way down.
Cubs.
I'm off to New You for repairs.
Get yourself a new face while you're at it. They know you now.
I might look in on the
New You myself. Number 483.
- You? Why?
- It's that last runner.
He got a face change on Last Day.
If so, someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Check it out.
Got a runner in power center.
What's with you?
Last night.
You had a kicker.
She must have got him in the head.
Identify.
Clear, Francis 7.
There goes another one.
Why do they run instead of going on Carrousel?
Good one.
Runner terminated, power center.
7106, identification correct.
- See you in the hydro toner.
- Be right with you.
Logan 5...
...approach and identify.
Sit facing the screen, Logan 5.
Identify.
Do you identify this object?
Negative.
Question: What is it?
That is the name of the object. Ankh.
Do you identify this word...
"... Sanctuary"?
Negative.
Sanctuary is a pre
- catastrophe code word...
...used for a place of immunity.
I don't understand.
The object ankh...
...has been identified with the code word "Sanctuary. "
The object and the word both relate...
...to runners who have not been accounted for.
- Question-
- Hold.
Unaccounted runners: 1056.
You may state your question.
1056 unaccounted for?
The number is correct.
That's impossible.
Question: Maybe they weren't all runners.
Maybe most of them reached life renewal on Carrousel.
Question:
Nobody reached renewal?
But everybody believes that some-
The question was answered.
You mean, nobody's ever been renewed?
The question has been answered.
You are authorized to penetrate city seals...
...and search outside the dome.
The seals?
Question: What seals?
Outside?
There's nothing outside.
You will find Sanctuary and destroy.
Question:
What if I need help from another Sandman?
Negative. You will begin assignment by becoming...
...a runner seeking Sanctuary.
Question:
I'm only red six now.
How can I pretend that
I'm approaching Last Day?
Identify.
My life clock.
Question: My life clock?
Retrogram complete.
Procedure 033-03.
But am I still red 6?
I had four more years.
I will get them back, won't I?
You will take the object ankh with you for identification.
Question:
Do I get my four years back?
What the hell took you so long?
It was...
...the debriefing.
It was more complicated than usual.
Come on, get in the water.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
You've been skulling out too much.
First nursery, and now silly questions.
But did you?
Did I what?
See anybody renewed?
Of course.
Anybody we know?
Look...
...get into the water.
You need it more than I do.
Francis, I have to talk to you.
I'll see you.
Here I am.
Now tell me why.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
I'm the most beautiful woman you ever saw, I suppose.
Maybe.
- And you must have me?
- Yes. Something like that.
- Just like that?
- Yes, why not?
But I still have the choice?
Of course.
Then the answer's still no.
No, I don't believe you.
- That's why you had me brought here?
- Would you have come on your own?
Well, there it is. I was right.
You can have any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
Why show me?
Because I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running? Dying, what?
Both. But running is what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows.
Try like hell for renewal. You have the same chance as anyone else. Carrousel.
Look, don't you understand? It's different now because it's me!
My life.
Help me.
How can I?
Where'd you get that?
I got it from a runner.
And then you killed him.
It was my job.
But now...
...it's different.
Believe me.
I don't.
Speak to your friends for me.
What friends?
Look, I don't have much time!
I never heard of a
Sandman running, ever.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
First level, near the hand.
Don't look for us, we'll see you.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
Can you do it?
Will you?
Tonight?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Jessica.
We all are.
But he has heard about Sanctuary.
And that makes him dangerous to all of us.
Doesn't it?
Oh, thanks, Francis. I can use a break.
Just don't take forever, like last time.
You love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good run.
You spoke to them?
Them?
Why are you here?
I'm here to help you.
Come with me to Arcade.
Wait, Logan.
We have to talk.
Yes, we have to.
What is it?
A runner. In Cathedral.
A woman. Come on.
You better go home.
I'd rather be with you.
Logan's got a mean one tonight.
- Cathedral. I better help him.
- Watch out.
Careful, they'll cut you to pieces before you see them.
Are the cubs really as wild as they say?
Never been there, have you?
No, of course not.
You wanted to come with me. You'll find out.
They're wild, all right.
They're the violent ones. There's no place else for them, unless they change.
People say it's because they're born in breeders.
Had you heard that?
We're all born in breeders.
But most of us don't end up running wild in Cathedral.
No, but they say human mothering might be better.
I wish I'd known my mother.
Where do you get these crazy ideas?
When did you begin to question Last Day?
I didn't say I questioned it.
Do you?
Entering a reservation for violent delinquents.
Authorized persons only.
I've never been in this quadrant before.
Request door open, Cathedral Plaza.
Logan 5 authorized to enter risk area.
They shut it to keep in the cubs.
Let me go first.
Sometimes they're waiting just inside there.
Quick, before it closes.
Don't be afraid.
What's your name?
Mary 2.
Where do you live?
Here.
Why aren't you in nursery?
I'm very smart.
When are you green?
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs.
You're a nice old lady.
No, don't.
Might be a decoy.
Runner!
Watch out!
Circle! Circle!
Get behind them.
Don't let them get away.
Billy, come on!
Billy, we've got one!
We've got a runner and his pair-up.
And look who decided to run.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday.
They said I'd never get him, but I cut him up good.
I feel sorry for you, boy.
For me?
You better feel sorry for yourself.
I feel sorry for you, Billy.
How old are you?
Your time is running out here.
How long have you got left here?
A year, six months? What happens when you're 16 and you go to green?
Nothing will happen. Nothing!
I make the rules here.
No cubs over 15, Billy!
Look, have you ever seen a cub who's turned to green?
You'll have to leave then...
...because they won't let you stay here.
And if you do try and stay here...
...your young friends here will rip your guts apart!
Muscle!
All right, children, playtime's over.
How many of you want this to be Last Day?
Come on, we can rush him!
Come on, we can take him again!
Come on! Cut me!
Runner?
There's been a terrible error.
My life clock must have broken in some way.
I'm nowhere near 30.
I'm 22.
I should be green.
Did you hear me? Green!
- Now, don't be afraid!
- Let me go! Let me go!
I am not going to hurt you.
Now, look.
There.
There. See?
We want to help you.
Sanctuary?
This means nothing to you?
Listen...
...if they find you, throw this hard enough to break it.
But remember, don't breathe until you get away.
It's blind gas.
Runner?
Runner terminated at 0. 16.
Ready for clean up,
Cathedral quadrant 39.
I must tell you now. When we were in
Arcade, I was taking you to be killed.
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.
But you do now?
Of course.
You let the runner go.
Then tell me where Sanctuary is.
Take me to your friends.
I can't tell you.
And if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
But you saw me let her go. Tell them.
They won't listen. You're a Sandman.
They won't take the chance.
Request maze car, Cathedral Plaza.
Stand by to open door.
It's open.
Come on, we got to go.
Where will you go now?
Back to Arcade.
I'm going to get a new face.
But you can't, you're a runner.
No one will do it.
There's New You 483.
I think there's someone there can help me.
Maybe there is.
The cheeks could be narrowed, the mouth changed...
Please let me know as soon as you've made your selection.
I'll let you know as soon as she's decided.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen.
I think we've had only one since I've been here.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else.
Doc, there's a Sandman here. Can you see him?
Doc is ready, Sandman.
I recommend a more detailed study of our projections.
There are new suggestions for your consideration...
- This is a real privilege, Sandman.
- For me too.
I thought you'd be older.
I mean, I was expecting a red.
I am.
Your own work?
Yes, I did it myself.
Right on there.
I'll show you.
This is the Aesculaptor Mark 3.
The latest. It's completely self-contained.
It has a tilt bed and cryojectors in the platform.
Well, Sandman, what will it be?
Face job? Full-body job?
Just the face.
Fine, Holly'll get you ready.
You're in expert hands.
Believe me.
Will you get on the table, please?
Want me to take my clothes off?
Not for your face.
You shouldn't have brought him here.
I didn't bring him.
What's the difference?
He's blinking.
He wants to run.
Run?
He's a Sandman.
I tell you, he's running. I know.
Maybe.
I just wish he'd gone somewhere else.
All right, he gets a face.
I like dark hair.
Tell him to give you dark hair.
All set?
Did you have anything special in mind?
I don't care, just-
Dark hair.
Oh, yes.
Holly would like dark hair.
We'll start by narrowing the cheekbones.
With this, there's no waiting for scar burnishing.
It's all in one.
Watch now.
Here's the improvement.
Instant healing before you feel a thing.
Hello, yes?
Yes, they are.
Done.
Pay attention, Sandman.
I'm proud of this machine.
Perfect depth adjustment on this one.
The beam will cut through that uniform and just through the skin beneath.
Absolute precision.
Watch now.
Just imagine what would happen...
...if the healing stopped functioning.
Doc, the machine is spinning!
Right! It's a trap.
They know.
I'm a runner!
- What's going on?
- Get out of my way! Get off me!
What are you talking about?
I saw you let a runner go.
In Cathedral.
I was there!
Follow me.
Stay close.
We've got to go through the Love Shop.
Where'd they go?
A Sandman and a green?
Didn't you see them?
- Why do you run from your friend?
- Because he is my friend.
I don't want to be killed by him, or anyone else.
He's good, isn't he?
You mean, will he find us and kill us? Yes. Or one of the others will.
You know, they won't believe us.
Maybe not. But I'd rather take my chance with them than with Francis.
They won't listen.
Do you think Sandmen will?
There's no other way for me.
We'll convince them.
You better stay behind me.
How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now.
They'll let us in when they're sure.
There, 17th Quadrant IK.
- Whose signal?
- Logan 5.
- Who's available?
-7, 9 and Arcade Patrol.
Sandman, put your hands on your head.
Clasp your fingers together.
Now turn your hands over. Palms up.
In a moment, a light will shine in your eyes.
Walk into it. Jessica first. Then you, Sandman.
You will have to stoop, but don't unclasp your hands.
Do you agree?
Move against the pillar.
Up against it!
Look, I'm a runner.
She brought me here because
I begged her to help me.
- He's lying.
- No Sandman ever ran.
You don't run.
You kill runners.
You have always killed runners.
Yes, I have.
But now it's my turn.
And I find I want to live.
What's the matter with you?
He's a runner! He's blinking!
We must help anyone who asks. We must!
Or we're the same as they are, deciding who lives or dies!
Holly. Holly New You 483.
He's dead. Doc is dead.
And the Sandman came.
It's him!
He killed Doc.
Wait!
He's running.
Tell them the rest!
He's the one.
And you, too. I remember.
He was in a hurry.
A face job only.
And I said, dark hair.
And then he killed Doc...
...and you grabbed me and the machine blew up and I ran.
I ran.
Holly, please!
The other Sandman.
Remember?
The one who came after?
That's right.
The other one came after.
And he was hunting the first one, wasn't he?
Wasn't he?
This one was running...
...and the other one was hunting him, remember?
He was after you.
I remember.
You were running.
I say we pass them through.
Runner...
...follow the corridor with the pipes overhead.
The way is always down.
Then this isn't Sanctuary?
No, you must follow the tunnel...
...to the end.
Where do I go from there?
When you come to the lock, there will be a message.
After that, there's no turning back.
No. Jessica goes back now.
Do you hear me?
You must go back now.
No, I'm going with you.
No, it's not possible.
No, you must go back.
Somebody take her back.
See that she gets out of here.
Please...
...it's dangerous.
I don't care.
I want to go to Sanctuary.
Take me with you?
Jessica, why?
You're still a green.
You're not running.
It doesn't matter what I am.
I want to be with you.
Listen to me!
I'm your friend. I understand.
We all go crazy once in a while.
Nobody knows except me. I won't tell.
I could have turned you in. I didn't.
But she's a runner.
And it's over.
Terminate her! Now!
You're a Sandman! Now, Logan. Now!
Stay out of it!
What do we do now?
Runner, this is the last gate.
Use your key now.
When the bell sounds again, use your key.
Good luck, runner.
May you find Sanctuary.
I still have the key
I took from the runner.
There.
We must be somewhere under the city.
I'd always heard the city received its power from the sea...
...but this looks forgotten.
Unused.
Runner, this is the last gate.
Use your key now.
When the bell sounds...
What do you suppose this was?
Looks like some sort of breeding pen.
They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything.
To eat, you know?
Must have been a savage world.
He said go down.
Maybe we can put these around us.
Let's take our clothes off first, before they freeze on us.
Welcome, humans.
I am ready for you.
Fish, plankton...
...sea greens and protein from the sea.
Fresh as harvest day.
Overwhelming, am I not?
Are you, too, startled?
Am I too removed from your ken?
What...?
Who are you?
I'm more than machine...
...or man.
More than a fusion of the two.
Don't you agree?
Wait for the winds.
Then, my birds...
...sing...
...and the deep grottoes whisper my name.
Box!
Box!
Box!
This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it?
Link?
How do you think we got here?
Same as the others.
Don't you remember?
Why do you think we're here?
Why?
Why?
We were sent here. And you know it.
You say others have been sent here. Where are they?
In hiding?
Hiding?
Yes.
Hiding.
You know about Sanctuary.
I know you do.
- Sanctuary?
- You have to help us.
You don't have a choice!
It's not your decision!
So tell us!
Very well.
Follow me.
This way.
How'd they get there?
Regular storage procedure.
The same as the other food.
The other food stopped coming, and they started.
What other food?
Fish and plankton and sea greens...
...and protein from the sea.
It's all here.
Ready.
Fresh as harvest day.
Fish and plankton.
Sea greens and protein from the sea.
And then it stopped coming...
...and they came instead.
So I store them here.
I'm ready...
...and you're ready.
It's my job...
...to freeze you!
Protein...
...plankton, grass from the sea!
My birds!
My birds!
What is it?
I don't know.
Whatever it is...
...it's warm.
We must be outside.
I didn't know any place could be like this.
Everything hurts.
I hate outside!
- I hate it! I hate it!
- Jessica!
It's all right. Come on, it's all right!
We'll be all right. Don't worry.
We'll get there.
Just got to find some water.
It's dark...
...and cold.
And I'm tired.
Come on. We must get out of here.
Sorry.
I can't go any further.
Let's rest in here.
Do you think everything will turn to ice?
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
It all seemed to make sense...
...until Box.
You think he was telling the truth?
What truth?
Perhaps we're the first people to get through.
Maybe Sanctuary isn't far now.
Another protected place.
Can't be outside.
Who would ever know?
And even if we find it...
...we can't go back now.
No, you're right.
It must be near now.
We'll find it.
Look!
Logan, look!
Water!
Look.
Look at your palm.
The crystal.
It's clear.
What does it mean?
The life clocks have no power outside.
We're free!
You can have...
...any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
You know.
The choice is still mine?
Of course.
This time...
...the answer's yes.
It must be Sanctuary!
Outside?
Exposed?
But it must be.
Whatever it is, there are probably people there.
And food and shelter.
Come on.
What do you suppose happened to the people?
I don't know. They must have left here.
A long time ago.
I wonder what they were like.
That must be one of them.
Then they looked almost like us.
Except...
...I've never seen a face like that before.
That must be...
...the look of being old.
They've all got names and numbers on them.
I wonder what they are?
"Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "
I wonder what it means.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm Logan 5.
This is Jessica 6.
I never much cared for my name, even when I could remember it.
We're from the city.
Yes, we came through the ice.
We got past Box.
Box?
This is Sanctuary, isn't it?
Sanctuary?
May I see your hand?
Look at his face.
His hair.
- Is that what it is to grow old?
- I guess so, yes.
But how old are you?
I don't know. I'm as old...
...as I am, I suppose.
Your hair is white.
Yes, well, it wasn't always that color, you know.
I got my color someplace here.
It wasn't your color. It wasn't much like hers, either.
Those cracks in your face...
...do they hurt?
Can I touch them?
Oh, my.
Try.
Are you alone here?
Hardly.
I got all these cats.
Is that what they're called? Cats?
And they've each got their own name.
Cats, of course, what else would they be called?
Cats!
You know they've each got three names?
The naming of cats is a difficult matter.
It's not just one of your holiday games.
You may think at first
I'm mad as a hatter...
...when I tell you that each cat's got three different names.
See, they got their ordinary name...
...and then they got their fancy name.
And that makes two names, doesn't it?
Now it's got a third name.
Can either of you two guess what that third name is?
Come on!
Above and beyond...
...there's one name that's left over...
...and this is the name you never will guess.
The name no human research can discover...
...but the cat itself knows...
...and never will confess.
Will you, Henry?
How long have you been living here?
A little longer than I can remember.
What kind of a place is this?
Well, it's...
...just a place, you know. Just a place.
How'd you get here?
I've always been here. Hello, Thomas.
Are there other people?
Oh, gracious, no.
Has anyone else ever passed through here?
There may be a few out there. I don't know.
What makes you think that?
My parents told me.
My mother...
...and my father.
You knew your mother and father?
Sure, they raised me.
How were you grown?
Inside your mother?
Right in there.
Are you sure?
That's what she told me.
I have to believe her. I don't know.
Where are they?
What was that?
Where are they now?
Where?
They're dead.
They are dead. Yeah.
Buried.
Buried?
They're buried.
Gus was the cat at the theater door.
His name, and I should have told you before, is really Asparagus.
But that's such a fuss to pronounce.
...we call him just Gus.
Why did you want to see my hand before?
You'd better show me yours.
Yes, you had.
That's lovely.
That's beautiful.
Can I have one of these?
I'm sorry. It's not possible.
That's just not fair.
Hello.
I'll give you one of my best cats, my favorite.
I'll give you a Jellicle cat. I will.
I'm sorry, I really don't have anything to give you.
That's the truth.
You hear that?
Here, you can have this.
What is that treasure?
I don't know.
You don't know. You're full of secrets as Macavity.
Macavity, Macavity. There's no one like Macavity.
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
What lies beyond this place? Do you know?
Welleverity.
I don't know, nothing. Nothing there.
Did your father or mother ever mention another place?
My mother? No, she never mentioned any other.
Nothing at all.
May we stay here?
We'd like to rest awhile.
Of course. This belongs to the people.
- What belongs to the people?
- Certainly does. All of it.
What people?
All of them. It's marked on the wall someplace.
All the people, all the time...
...shall not...
I'll be right back.
That sweet madman.
How could he come to exist?
He had a mother and a father.
And they spent their lives together.
One in a million, I suppose.
Who knows?
We are going on, aren't we?
There's nothing to go on to.
There's Sanctuary.
There is.
You want there to be one, but-
There has to be!
I know it exists.
- It has to.
- No, it does not. Not really.
Just so many people want it to exist, so many people who don't want to die...
...they want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes real.
But it doesn't exist. It never existed.
Just the hope.
You're wrong!
- It has to be! It has to be!
- Oh, Jessica.
Oh, my.
Don't cry.
Look, I got some bigger ones of these over there. I don't know who they all are.
I think they must be family.
That'll cheer you up.
That's my color. That's what it is.
Leave her alone.
Surprised you, Doris, didn't he?
Now, I don't know who these all are.
I'm quite used to them. They all look the same to me now.
When I first found them, they were a little different.
You know, feel free to look at them.
But they're all old men.
Father said that one of these people...
...never told a lie. I don't know which one it is.
You thought I wouldn't find you, didn't you?
You thought I'd quit, huh?
What did you do to him?
You know what he was? He was a Sandman.
He was happy.
You ruined him. You killed him.
Wait.
I've seen this face before.
Yes, isn't he the...
Logan!
Why, Logan?
Why?
Is this good? Is this what you want?
We had good times.
I let you go.
You wouldn't terminate a runner...
...and I covered for you!
Why did you let her?
And now, I have to finish you.
You are terminated, runner.
Francis, look at your palm.
Go on. Look at it.
Go on, look at it!
Believe me, it's true.
This isn't the truth.
This is a lie!
Francis, stop! Listen!
That was the right shot.
Watch out, now.
He's tricky.
He'll fool you.
You renewed.
I don't want to say anymore...
...but I hope that is understood, young woman.
Of course.
Now don't forget...
...you promised.
We'll remember.
But that's a long time off.
I wish I knew, but...
Long time off.
What are we promising him?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
We can't.
We're going back.
Back?
To what?
I have to tell them the truth.
You won't be able to tell anybody anything.
You'll be killed.
Not when they've learned of this.
They won't listen.
Things don't change.
We can stay here together.
Have a life as long as his together.
Jessica, things do change. Look.
You're lying. You don't want to change anything.
You want to go back to kill!
- Listen to me.
- Francis was right!
- You really- -
Look. Listen to me.
The life clocks made me kill Francis.
They kill people every single day.
If I don't go back and try to stop that...
...destroy them...
...I can't live here.
I couldn't live anywhere.
Don't you understand that?
All I want...
...is to be alive and with you.
That's all.
Do you think I want anything different now?
Must we leave soon?
As soon as it gets light.
We're going to have to leave you in the morning.
What kind of people are you?
She promised you'd stay here and bury me! You did!
Come with us.
Yes. Come with us.
Yes, you must.
We need you now.
If people see you, then they must believe us.
Where you going?
We're going to a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Young people.
All the people, all the time.
Five million.
How many...?
Is that more than my cats?
More.
Much, much more.
More than...? Oh, my!
And all of them alive!
Is it a long journey?
It's a journey.
We lived in most of these houses.
But they became too small for us...
...and ran out of mice,
I guess. I don't know.
I used to come fishing here...
...but somehow all the fish died. Long time ago, now.
Nothing sadder than a dead fish.
All young people, you say?
I don't even remember what...
Although, of course, the young people, yeah...
They say this thing used to be called a road.
Had to give bits of metal to use it.
How far away is it?
It's much further than it looks.
It's big.
It's cold. Let's go back to the fire.
- We'll be there soon.
- Soon?
That's worth its weight in gold.
That is, when it's cold.
You know, I've been thinking.
Those words we saw...
..."Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "
What do they mean?
Oh, well, you see...
..."Beloved wife" would mean my mother, see?
And "Beloved husband" would be more like...
...my father.
- They use those words to stay together.
- Stay together?
- I can't put it any different.
- But you mean...
I mean, they lived together all their years?
Before I come along, I don't know.
But after, yeah, they did.
So people stayed together for this feeling of love?
They would live and raise children...
...and be remembered?
They raised me, didn't they? Right in there.
I think I'd like that.
Don't you?
Why not?
Beloved husband.
Beloved wife.
Beloved son.
Here we go.
That's right.
You mean to say those people know ahead of time when they'll die?
- That's right.
- That's silly.
What's the reason for that?
That's the way things are.
The way they've always been.
It takes all the fun out of dying.
But if they're all shut up tight in there...
...how we going to get to see them?
All the young people?
What'd you say?
What does the water do?
Must be part of the power system.
The ocean tides are turned into energy somehow.
- Does it go inside the city?
- Yes, I think so.
I don't know where, though.
Just took it for granted, like everything else.
I think it's our only chance.
Here, let me help you!
No, I can look after myself.
If ever a time comes...
...when I can't look after myself, I said to my cats...
"... Why, that's the moment that you... "
Where are you?
I'll have to tell him.
We're going to try and get in through here.
I'm sorry...
...I don't think you can make it.
Oh, my. I was so looking forward to seeing all those people.
I want you to meet them too.
Stay here as long as you can.
We'll bring them to you.
All the people?
You know...
...they've never seen a cat.
People have never seen a cat?
Oh, my.
Don't go in there!
You don't have to die!
No one has to die at 30!
You can live!
Live!
Live and grow old!
I've seen it!
She's seen it!
Look!
Look!
Look, it's clear!
Last Day...
...Capricorn 29s.
Year of the city 2274.
Carrousel begins.
No! Don't!
Don't go!
Listen to him!
He's telling the truth!
We've been outside!
There's another world outside!
We've seen it!
The life clocks are a lie!
Carrousel is a lie!
There is no renewal!
Nobody's going to be renewed!
Believe me!
Please listen!
Logan 5...

Did you find Sanctuary?
We will begin surrogation.

Unacceptable. The answer does not program.

Here they come.
I'd like the parents and the grandparents.
Yes, all the close family.
Smile! Hold fast. Beautiful!
Congratulations.
Well...
I guess we really did it, huh?
You and Betty have been inseparable...
...since you met in
Dr. Scott's courses.
Tell you the truth, Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place.
I mean...
Okay, guys, this is it!
You ready?
Look, Betty's gonna throw her bouquet.
I got it!
- I got it!
- Hey, big fella.
Looks like it could be your turn next.
Who knows.
So long.
See you, Brad.
Come on, hop in.
See you, Brad.
Brad, wasn't it wonderful?
Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful?
Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Munroe.
And now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.
- Yes, Janet. Ralph's a lucky guy.
- Yes.
Oh, I always cry at weddings.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
Ralph will be in line for promotion in a year.
Yes.
- Hey, Janet.
- Yes, Brad?
I've got something to say.
I really loved
The skillful way
You beat the other girls
To the bride's bouquet
Oh, Brad.
- The river was deep but I swam it
- Janet
- The future is ours, so let's plan it
- Janet
- So please don't tell me to can it
- Janet
I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet
I love you
- The road was long but I ran it
- Janet
- A fire's in my heart and you fan it
- Janet
- There's one fool for you and I am it
- Janet
I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet
I love you
Here's a ring to prove
That I'm no joker
There's three ways
That love can grow
That's good, bad
Or mediocre
Oh, J-A-N-E-T
I love you so
- Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had
- Oh, Brad
- Now we're engaged and I'm so glad
- Oh, Brad
- That you met Mom and you know Dad
- Oh, Brad
I've one thing to say and that's
Brad, I'm mad
For you too
Oh, Brad
Oh, damn it
I'm mad
Oh, Janet
For you
I love you too
There's one thing left to do
Ah-ooh
- And that's go see the man who began it
- Janet
- When we met in his science, exam it
- Janet
- Made me give you the eye, then panic
- Janet
Now I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet
I love you
Damn it, Janet
Oh, Brad, I'm mad
Damn it, Janet
I love you
I would like, if I may...
...to take you on a strange journey.
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...
...when Brad Majors and his fiancée, Janet Weiss...
...two young, ordinary, healthy kids...
...left Denton that late November evening...
...to visit a Dr. Everett Scott...
...ex-tutor and now friend to both of them.
It's true there were dark storm clouds...
...heavy, black and pendulous...
...toward which they were driving.
It's true also that the spare tire they carried...
...was badly in need of some air.
But they, being normal kids and...
...on a night out...
...they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening.
On a night out.
It was a night out...
...they were going to remember...
...for a very long time.
I have never been a quitter.
To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent...
... to every instinct in my body.
But as president...
... I must put the interests
of America first.
America needs a full-time president...
... and a full-time Congress...
... particularly at this time...
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.
They sure do take their lives in their hands.
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type.
What's the matter, Brad, darling?
We took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh.
Where did that motorcyclist come from?
I guess we'll just have to turn back.
What was that bang?
We must have a blowout.
Damn it! I knew I should've gotten that spare tire fixed.
You stay here and I'll go for help.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't we pass a castle a few miles back?
Maybe they have a telephone
I could use.
I'm going too.
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.
Besides, the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman...
...and you might never come back again.
In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright
There's a guiding star
No matter what
Or...
... who you are
There's a light
Over at the Frankenstein place
There's a light
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light, light
In the darkness
Of everybody's life
The darkness must go
Down the river
Of nights dreaming
Flow morphia slow
Let the sun
And light come streaming
Into my life
Into my life
There's a light
Over at the Frankenstein place
There's a light
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light
Light
In the darkness
Of everybody's life
And so...
...it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet...
...and they had found the assistance that their plight required.
Or had they?
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.
Hello.
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.
This is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.
Do you have a phone we might use?
You're wet.
Yes, it's raining.
Yes.
Oh.
I think, perhaps, you better both come inside.
You're too kind.
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?
It's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
This way.
Are you having a party?
You've arrived on a rather special night.
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.
He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky!
It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control
I remember
Doing the time warp
Drinking
Those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
- And a step to the right
- With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded
I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You're spaced out on sensation
Like you're under sedation
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
I was walking down the street
Just having a think
When a snake of a guy
Gave me an evil wink
He shook a me up
He took me by surprise
He had a pickup truck
And the devil's eyes
He stared at me
And I felt a change
Time meant nothing
Never would again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
- And then a step to the right
- With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
- And then a step to the right
- With your hands on your hips
Bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Say something.
Say! Do any of you guys know how to Madison?
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.
We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.
They're probably foreigners with different ways.
They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
How do you do
I see you've met
My faithful handyman
He's just a little brought down
Because when you knocked
He thought you were the candyman
Don't get strung out
By the way I look
Don't judge a book by its cover
I'm not much of a man
By the light of day
But by night I'm one hell of a lover
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
Let me show you around
Maybe play you a sound
You look like you're both
Pretty groovy
Or if you want something visual
That's not too abysmal
We could take in an old
Steve Reeves movie
I'm glad we caught you at home
Could we use your phone?
- We're both in a bit of a hurry
- Right
We'll just say where we are
- Then go back to the car
- A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Furter
We don't want to be any worry
Well, you got caught with a flat
Well, how about that
Well, babies, don't you panic
By the light of the night
It'll all seem all right
I'll get you a satanic mechanic
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
Why don't you stay for the night
- Night
- Or maybe a bite
Bite
I could show you
My favorite obsession
I've been making a man
With blond hair and a tan
And he's good for relieving
My tension
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
Hit it! Hit it!
- I'm just a sweet transvestite
- Sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
So come up to the lab
And see what's on the slab
I see you shiver
With antici...
- pation
But maybe the rain
Is really to blame
So I'll remove the cause
But not the symptom
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Brad!
We'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and this is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.
You are...?
You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory.
Some people would give their right arm for the privilege.
People like you, maybe?
I've seen it.
Come along. The master doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Shift it!
Is he...? Frank, I mean, is he your husband?
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.
Magenta.
Columbia.
Go and assist Riff Raff.
I will entertain...
Brad Majors and this is my fiancée, Janet Vice.
- Weiss.
- Weiss?
Enchantê.
Well, how nice.
And what charming underclothes you both have.
But here, put these on.
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.
It's not often we receive visitors here.
Let alone offer them hospitality.
Hospitality! All we wanted to do was use your telephone. Goddamn it!
A reasonable request you have ignored!
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!
How forceful you are, Brad.
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.
You must be awfully proud of him, Janet.
Well, yes, I am.
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.
Oh, well. How about you?
Everything is in readiness, master.
We merely await your word.
Tonight, my unconventional conventionists...
...you are to witness a new breakthrough...
...in biochemical research.
And paradise is to be mine!
It was strange the way it happened.
Suddenly...
...you get a break.
All the pieces seem to fit into place.
What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.
The answer was there all the time.
It took a small accident to make it happen.
- An accident!
- An accident!
That's how I discovered the secret.
That elusive ingredient.
That spark...
...that is the breath of life.
Yes.
I have that knowledge.
I hold the secret...
...to life itself!
You see...
...you are fortunate.
For tonight is the night...
...that my beautiful creature is destined to be born.
Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator.
And step up the reactor power input...
...three more points!
Oh, Brad!
It's all right, Janet.
Oh, Rocky!
The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head
I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread
Oh, woe is me
My life is a misery
Oh, can't you see
That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer
I woke up this morning with a start
When I fell out of bed
That ain't no crime
And left from my dreaming
Was a feeling of unnameable dread
That ain't no crime
My high is low
I'm dressed up with no place to go
And all I know
Is I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer
- That ain't no crime.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- That ain't no crime.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, my baby!
The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head
That ain't no crime
I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread
That ain't no crime
Oh, woe is me
My life is a mystery
And can't you see
That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer
- That ain't no crime.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That ain't no crime
Well, really!
That's no way to behave on your first day out.
But since you're such an exceptional beauty...
...I'm prepared to forgive you.
Oh, I just love success!
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.
He's okay.
Okay?
Okay?!
I think we can do better than that.
Now, Brad and Janet...
...what do you think of him?
Well...
I don't like men with too many muscles.
I didn't make him for you!
He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval.
A weakling weighing 98 pounds
Will get sand in his face
When kicked to the ground
And soon in the gym
With a determined chin
The sweat from his pores
As he works for his cause
Will make him glisten
And gleam
And with massage
And just a little bit of steam
He'll be pink
And quite clean
He'll be a strong man
Oh, honey
But the wrong man
He'll eat nutritious high protein
And swallow raw eggs
Try to build up his shoulders
His chest, arms and legs
Such an effort
If he only knew of my plan
In just seven days
I can make you a man
He'll do press-ups and chin-ups
Do the snatch, clean and jerk
He thinks dynamic tension
Must be hard work
Such strenuous living
I just don't understand
When in just seven days
Oh, baby
I can make you a man
Eddie!
Whatever happened to Saturday night
When you dressed sharp, felt all right
Don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine
I'd go for a ride with chicks who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing
On a rock 'n' roll show
We climbed in the back seat
We really had a good time
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
Lovely party!
My head used to swim
From the perfume I smelled
My hands kind of fumbled
With her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine
Get in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his last song
With your arms around your girl
You tried to sing along
It felt pretty good
Really had a good time
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
One from the vaults.
Oh, baby!
Don't be upset.
It was a mercy killing.
He had a certain naive charm...
...but no muscle.
But a deltoid
And a bicep
A hot groin
And a tricep
Makes me...
... shake
Makes me want to take Charles Atlas
By the hand
In just seven days
Oh, baby
I can make you a man
I don't want no dissension
Just dynamic tension
I'm a muscle fan
In just seven days
I can make you a man
Dig it if you can
In just seven days
I can make you a man
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
There are those who say that life is an illusion...
...and that reality is simply a figment of the imagination.
If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe.
However, the sudden departure of their host...
...and his creation...
...into the seclusion of his somber bridal suite...
...had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.
A feeling which grew as the other guests departed...
...and they were shown to their separate rooms.
Who is it? Who's there?
It's only me, Janet.
Brad, darling, come in.
Oh, Brad!
Yes, my darling! But what if...?
Everything's going to be all right.
Oh, I hope so, my darling.
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never...
Yes. Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
I think you'll really find it quite pleasurable.
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!
Brad. Oh, Brad!
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!
I was saving myself.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Promise you won't tell Brad?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!
It'll destroy us.
Don't worry. We'll be away from here in the morning.
Oh, Brad, you're so strong and protective.
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.
Oh, Janet.
Janet!
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.
I thought it was the real thing!
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.
You liked it, didn't you?
There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
Oh, Brad, you have wasted so much time already.
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.
You promise you won't tell?
On my mother's grave.
Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.
The new playmate is loose
and somewhere in the castle grounds.
Magenta has just released the dogs.
Coming!
What's happening here? Where's Brad?
Where's anybody?
Oh, Brad!
Brad, my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Oh, If only we hadn't made this journey.
If only the car hadn't broken down.
If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Oh, Brad.
What have they done with him?
Brad, how could you?
But you're hurt.
Did they do this to you?
Here. I'll dress your wounds.
Baby, there. Oh.
"Emotion: Agitation or disturbance
of mind...
...vehement or excited mental state."
It is also a powerful and irrational master.
And from what Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...
... there seemed little doubt
that Janet was indeed...
... its slave.
Tell us about it, Janet.
I was feeling done in
Couldn't win
I'd only ever kissed before
You mean she...?
I thought there's no use getting
Into heavy petting
It only leads to trouble
And seat wetting
Now all I want to know
Is how to go
I've tasted blood and I want more
More, more, more.
I'll put up no resistance
I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch
I need assistance
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Then if anything grows
While you pose
I'll oil you up and rub you down
Down, down, down.
And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand
Oh, and I need action
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night?
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night
Mercy!
How did it happen?
I understood you were to be watching.
I was only away for a minute, master.
Well, see if you can find him on the monitor.
Master.
Master, we have a visitor.
Hey, Scotty!
Dr. Everett Scott.
You know this earthling...
- this person?
I most certainly do. He happens to be an old friend of mine.
I see.
So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.
You came here with a purpose.
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad.
But this Dr. Everett Scott, his name is not unknown to me.
He was a science teacher at Denton High.
And now he works for your government.
He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation...
...of that which you call UFOs!
Isn't that right, Brad?
He might be. I don't know.
The intruder is entering the building, master.
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.
Shall we inquire of him in person?
Great Scott!
Frank N. Furter.
We meet at last.
Dr. Scott!
Brad! What are you doing here?
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.
You know perfectly well what Brad Majors is doing here.
It was part of your plan, was it not?
That he and his female should check the layout for you?
Well, unfortunately for you all, the plans are to be changed.
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.
I know Brad is.
I assure you, Brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me.
I came here to find Eddie.
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?
What do you know of Eddie?
I know a great deal about a lot of things.
You see, Eddie happens to be my nephew.
Dr. Scott.
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
Listen! I made you...
...and I can break you just as easily.
Master, dinner is prepared!
Excellent.
Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional.
Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals:
The breaking of bread, the last meal of the condemned man...
...and now this meal.
However informal it might appear...
... you can be sure there was to be
very little bonhomie.
A toast.
To absent friends.
To absent friends.
And Rocky.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Rocky
- Happy birthday...
- Shall we?
We came here to discuss Eddie.
Eddie!
It's a rather tender subject.
Another slice, anyone?
Excuse me.
I knew he was in with a bad crowd, but it was worse than I imagined.
Aliens!
Dr. Scott!
Go on, Dr. Scott.
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?
Just what exactly are you implying?
It's all right!
That's all right, Brad.
From the day he was born
He was trouble
He was the thorn
In his mother's side
She tried in vain
But he never caused her
Nothing but shame
He left home...
... the day she died
From the day she was gone
All he wanted
Was rock 'n' roll porn
Und a motorbike
Shooting up junk
He was a low-down, cheap little punk
Taking everyone for a ride
When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no-good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife
- What a guy
- Makes you cry
Und I did
Everybody shoved him
I very nearly loved him
I said, hey, listen to me
Stay sane inside insanity
But he locked the door
And threw away the key
But he must've been drawn
Into something
Making him warn me
In a note which reads:
What's it say? What's it say?
"I'm out of my head
Oh, hurry, or I may be dead
They mustn't carry out
Their evil deeds"
When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no-good kid
When he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife
- What a guy
- Makes you cry
Und I did
When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no-good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife
- What a guy
- Woe, woe, woe
- Makes you cry
- Hey, hey, hey
Und I did
Hey
Oh.
Oh, Rocky!
How could you?!
This way! This way!
Shut up!
I'll tell you once
I won't tell you twice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
Your apple pie
Don't taste too nice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
I've laid the seed
It should be all you need
You're as sensual as a pencil
Wound up like an E or first string
When we made it
Did ya hear a bell ring?
You got a block
Well, take my advice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
The transducer
Will seduce ya
My feet! I can't move my feet!
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
You are.
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.
We're trapped.
It's something you'll get used to
A mental mind fuck can be nice
No!
You won't find Earth people the easy mark you imagine.
This sonic transducer...
...it is some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device?
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.
It's something we ourselves have been working on for a while.
But it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it.
A device capable of breaking down solid matter...
...and then projecting it through space, and who knows...
...perhaps even time itself!
He's gonna send us to another planet?
Planet schmanet, Janet.
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
You'd better wise up
Build your thighs up
You'd better wise up
And then she cried out:
Stop!
Don't get hot and flustered
Use a bit of mustard
You're a hot dog
But you'd better not...
... try to hurt her
Frank Furter
You're a hot dog
But you'd better not...
... try to hurt her
Frank Furter
You're a hot dog
My God! I can't stand any more of this.
First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you toss him like an old coat for Rocky.
You chew people up and then you spit them out again.
I loved you.
Do you hear me? I loved you.
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.
You're like a sponge. You drain others of their love and emotion.
Well, I've had enough!
Choose between me and Rocky, so named because of the rocks in his head.
It's not easy, having a good time.
Even smiling makes my face ache.
And my children turn on me.
Rocky's behaving just the way that Eddie did.
Maybe I made a mistake...
...splitting his brain between the two of them.
I grow weary of this world!
When shall we return to Transylvania?!
Magenta...
...I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother, Riff Raff.
You have both served me well.
Loyalty such as yours shall not go unrewarded.
You'll discover that when the mood takes me, I can be quite generous.
I ask for nothing, master.
And you shall receive it in abundance!
Come. We are ready for the floorshow.
And so, by some extraordinary
coincidence...
...fate, it seemed, had decided that Brad and Janet...
...should keep that appointment with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.
But it was to be in a situation...
...which none of them could have possibly foreseen.
And just a few hours after announcing their engagement...
...Brad and Janet had both tasted...
...forbidden fruit.
This in itself was proof...
...that their host was a man of little morals...
...and some persuasion.
What further indignities were they to be subjected to?
And what of the floorshow that had been spoken of?
In an empty house...
...in the middle of the night?
What diabolical plan...
...had seized
Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?
From what had gone before, it was clear...
...that this was to be no picnic.
It was great when it all began
I was a regular Frankie fan
But it was over when he had the plan
To start working on a muscleman
Now the only thing that gives me hope
Is my love of a certain dope
Rose tints my world
Keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain
I'm just seven hours old
Truly beautiful to behold
And somebody should be told
My libido hasn't been controlled
Now the only thing I've come to trust
Is an orgasmic rush of lust
Rose tints my world
And keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain
It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy
I'll be good, you'll see
Take this dream away
What's this
Let's see
I feel sexy
What's come over me
Here it comes again
I feel released
Bad times deceased
My confidence has increased
Reality is here
The game has been disbanded
My mind has been expanded
It's a gas that Frankie's landed
His lust is so sincere
Whatever happened...
... to Fay Wray
That delicate...
... satin-draped frame
As it clung to her thigh
How I started to cry
'Cause I wanted to be dressed
Just the same
Give yourself over
To absolute pleasure
Swim the warm waters
Of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares
Beyond any measure
And sensual daydreams
To treasure forever
Can't you just see it
Don't dream it
Be it
Don't dream it
Be it
Don't dream it
Be it
Don't dream it
Be it
We've got to get...
...out of this trap...
...before this decadence...
...saps our wills.
I've got to be strong...
...und try to hang on.
Or else my mind...
...may well snap.
Und my life will be lived...
... for the thrill
It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy
God bless...
... Lily St. Cyr
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
I'm a wild and untamed thing
I'm a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes "ping"
Your heart'll thump
And your blood will sing
Let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it
Till the life has gone
Rose tints my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
We're a wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes "ping"
Your heart'll thump
And your blood will sing
So let the party
And the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it
Till the life has gone
Rose tints my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
We're a wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes "ping"
Your heart'll thump
And your blood will sing
So let the party
And the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it
Till the life has gone
Rose tints my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
Frank N. Furter
It's all over
Your mission is a failure
Your lifestyle's too extreme
I'm your new commander
You now are my prisoner
We return to Transylvania
Prepare the transit beam
Wait!
I can explain.
On the day I went away
Goodbye
Was all I had to say
Now I
I want to come again and stay
Oh, my, my
Smile and that will mean I may
'Cause I've seen
Blue skies through the tears
In my eyes
And I realize
I'm going home
I'm going home
Everywhere it's been the same
Feeling
Like I'm outside in the rain
Wheeling
Free to try and find a game
Dealing
Cards for sorrow
Cards for pain
'Cause I've seen
Blue skies
Through the tears
In my eyes
And I realize
That I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
How sentimental.
And also presumptuous of you.
You see, when I said "we"...
...were to return to Transylvania...
...I referred only to Magenta and myself.
I'm sorry, however, if you found my words misleading...
...but you see...
...you are to remain here.
In spirit anyway.
Good heavens, that's a laser.
Yes, Dr. Scott.
A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You're going to kill him?
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.
Society must be protected.
Exactly, Dr. Scott.
Now, Frank N. Furter, your time has come
Say goodbye to all of this...
...and hello to oblivion.
No.
No.
No!
Good God!
You killed them.
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.
They didn't like me!
They never liked me!
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're okay by me.
Dr. Scott...
...I'm sorry about your nephew.
Eddie?
Yes, well, perhaps it was for the best.
You should leave now, Dr. Scott, while it is still possible.
We are about to beam the entire house...
...back to the planet of Transsexual...
...in the galaxy of Transylvania.
Go.
Now.
Our noble mission is almost completed...
...my most beautiful sister.
And soon we shall return to the moon-drenched shores...
...of our beloved planet.
Sweet Transsexual.
Land of night.
To sing and dance once more to your dark refrain.
To take that...
...step to the right.
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
And our world...
...will do the time warp again!
I've done a lot
God knows I've tried
To find the truth
I've even lied
But all I know
Is down inside
I'm bleeding
And superheroes
Come to feast
To taste the flesh
Not yet deceased
And all I know
Is still the beast
Is feeding
And crawling
On the planet's face
Some insects
Called the human race
Lost in time
And lost in space
And meaning
Meaning

Man (on radio):
DUE IN A LARGE PART TO
A MAJOR SURPLUS OF TOMATOES.
TOMATO JUICE.
THE TOMATO CROP
CONTINUES TO GROW AT
AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE.
WITHIN THE LAST 12 HOURS,
WE HAVE RECEIVED
A NUMBER OF
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS
FROM THROUGHOUT THE NATION
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT
BE CONNECTED TO
THIS STRANGE PHENOMENON.
Man (voice echoing):
HMM.
SURE DOESN'T TASTE LIKE
TOMATO JUICE.
- LOOK AT THE GIANT
TOMATO, MARTHA.
- (growling)
I DIDN'T KNEW
THEY GREW 'EM
SO BIG, JESS.
I WONDER WHERE
HE'S GOING.
HE GOT LITTLE TIMMY.

Man:
THE TOMATOES ARE COMING!
SHERIFF, THEY'RE COMING!
MY GOD,
DID YOU SEE THAT?
A TOMATO...
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.
- THE PILOT'S STILL IN THERE.
- FORGET ABOUT THE PILOT.
- COME OVER HERE!
- WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM.
IT'S JUST TOO INCREDIBLE!
A KAMIKAZE TOMATO!
- TOMATOES CAN'T FLY!
- YEAH?
THEY CAN'T EAT PEOPLE EITHER,
BUT THEY'RE DOING ONE HECK
OF AN IMPRESSION.
JIM, TALK TO THAT SHERIFF
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON.
GET OVER HERE!
HOW BAD IS IT?
WELL, SIR, I DEFINITELY
DON'T THINK IT'LL FLY AGAIN.
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT, YOU WEINER!
WHAT ABOUT THE TOMATOES.
WE FOUND TWO MORE BODIES
AT THE MAIN ROAD,
BUT WE PUSHED THE TOMATOES
BACK TO THE NORTH END.
- I DON'T THINK ANY
MANAGED TO BUST LOOSE.
- THEY BETTER NOT HAVE.
- I WANT THIS THING CONTAINED!
- I UNDERSTAND, BUT NOTHING
SEEMS TO STOP THEM.
WE TRIED CHEMICALS,
BUGS, BULLETS.
NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK.
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT
WANTS A COMPLETE
INVESTIGATION.
- WE CAN'T LET THIS OUT.
PEOPLE WOULD...
- PANIC, THAT'S WHAT.
AND YOU KNOW WHOSE ASS
IS ON THE LINE?
YOURS, MINE,
- AND THE ENTIRE
AG DEPARTMENT.
- LOOK OUT!
WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT
WANTS AN INVESTIGATION?
HE'LL GET HIS INVESTIGATION,
BUT WE'LL KEEP IT QUIET.
I'VE ARRANGED FOR
THE MOST OBSCURE GENERALS,
THE MOST OBSCURE SCIENTISTS,
AND TO HEAD THE INVESTIGATION,
- THIS MAN.
- I DON'T RECOGNIZE HIM.
NOBODY DOES.
HIS NAME IS MASON DIXON.
HE HASN'T WORKED
SINCE THE BAY OF PIGS.
- IS THERE ANY SIGN
OF A PROBLEM ELSEWHERE?
- NOT YET.
I'VE ORDERED THE ENTIRE
G.D.P. PROGRAM SHUT DOWN.
WAIT A MINUTE.
ISN'T THAT JIM RICHARDSON,
THE PRESS SECRETARY?
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
- THE PRESIDENT'S GOT HIM
KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE INVESTIGATION.
- WHY HIM?
- HE'S GOT A VEGETABLE
GARDEN, THAT'S WHY.
WITH PEAS AND CARROTS
AND SQUASH AND TOMATOES.
THAT SHERIFF TELLS ME
THERE WERE REPORTS OF INCIDENTS
LIKE THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTY.
OH, BULLSHIT.
ONE NUT SPOTS
A FLYING SAUCER,
AND PRETTY SOON
EVERYBODY'S SHAKING HANDS
WITH LITTLE GREEN MEN.
GOD, WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT.
ALL WE WANTED WAS A BIGGER,
HEALTHIER TOMATO.
LOOK OUT!
HERE IT COMES AGAIN!
WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS ONE, GENERAL?
OH, I WON THAT ONE
IN A THREE-LEGGED SACK RACE
- LAST ARMED FORCES DAY
PICNIC.
- (snoring)
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
GENERAL NUMBER TWO?
OH, HE WAS OUT
ALL NIGHT ON MANEUVERS.
LET HIM REST.
OH, I'M SORRY
I'M LATE, GENTLEMEN.
WOULD YOU FOLLOW ME, PLEASE?
CERTAINLY.
OH, GENERAL, WOULD YOU
WAKE UP, PLEASE?
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SIZE
OF THIS ROOM, GENTLEMEN.
IT'S ALL I COULD DO
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
NOW, ARE WE ALL HERE?
- WHERE'S JIM RICHARDSON?
- THE PRESS SECRETARY?
YES.
PERHAPS WE CAN GIVE HIM
A FEW MORE MINUTES.
GENERAL, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO ASK YOU,
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT THE NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE
TACTICAL TRAINING
COMMAND MEETING?
- YOU MEAN OPERATION NICHEFICT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
NOT REALLY. I'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING THE PERSONNEL
PROFICIENCY PLANNING
FOR PAGO-PAGO PARATROOP
PLATOON PATROLS.
OH, OPERATION PPPPP.
- WHAT'S THE POOP ON PPPPP?
- MOVING WELL.
DID SOMEBODY
MENTION MISFITS?
- NO. PPPPP.
- AH.
WELL, THEN, NICHEFICT
MUST BE PRETTY WELL
WRAPPED UP.
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,
MAY I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION, PLEASE?
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE,
I'D LIKE TO TURN THE MEETING
OVER TO DR. MORRISON.
- DOCTOR?
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
- "MAJOR."
- PARDON ME?
NEVER MIND.
WELL, AS I'M SURE
YOU'RE WELL AWARE,
THIS TOMATO PROBLEM HAS
CAUSED CONSIDERABLE CONCERN
WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC
COMMUNITY.
SCIENTISTS THROUGHOUT
THE NATION HAVE DIRECTED
THEIR ATTENTION
TO THIS VERY
VEXING PROBLEM
WITH ONLY
LIMITED SUCCESS.
HOWEVER,
WITH THE HELP OF
DR. FUJI NOKITOFA,
WE BELIEVE WE'VE
MADE A BREAKTHROUGH.
GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT
DR. NOKITOFA.
HOW DO YOU DO, DOCTOR?
VERY WELL, THANK YOU.
DR. NOKITOFA,
WOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN
THE PROJECT
TO THE GENTLEMEN?
GENTLEMEN, WHAT WE HAVE
DEVELOPED IS, IN ESSENCE,
A HALF-MAN, HALF-ROBOT,
A VERY SOPHISTICATED
COMBINATION OF
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
AND SUPERHUMAN POWERS
WHICH WE ARE CONFIDENT
WILL RESULT IN THE ULTIMATE
DESTRUCTION OF THE ENEMY.
THANK YOU,
DR. NOKITOFA.
ARE THERE ANY
COMMENTS, GENTLEMEN?
MR. BLACK?
AS HEAD OF THE FEDERAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,
I CERTAINLY DON'T MEAN TO
QUESTION THE BACKGROUND
OF THESE FINE GENTLEMEN,
BUT FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK
THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM
LIES IN TRINKETS
AND GADGETS.
THIS IS MAN
VERSUS VEGETABLE.
TECHNICALLY, SIR,
TOMATOES ARE FAGS.
HE MEANS "FRUITS."
AH. FRUITS.
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?
MR. DIXON,
I'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED
TO ASSIGN YOU
FOUR OF MY BEST AGENTS.
GENTLEMEN,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE MR. DIXON
TO HIS OPERATIVES.
THAT'S FINE, MR. PLATT.
IN THE MEANTIME,
THE REST OF US WILL ACCOMPANY
THE DOCTORS DOWN TO VIEW
A DEMONSTRATION
OF THE LATEST
ANTI-TOMATO PROJECT.
WE'LL BE GOING OUTSIDE,
MR. DIXON.
YOU'D BETTER BRING
YOUR COAT.
THERE'S A LITTLE JAP
IN THE AIR.
HE MEANS "NIP."
Man:
WASH, WASH, WASH.
SCRUB, SCRUB, SCRUB.
CAN YOU GET MY BACK?
- (Explosion)
- (screaming)
- OH, MY EYES!
OH, MY EYES!
- (alarm blaring)
WATER! WATER!
ACTUALLY, GENTLEMEN,
THIS PROJECT ENTAILS
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIMBS
WITH SUPERHUMAN POWERS.
UNFORTUNATELY,
BUDGET LIMITATIONS
HAVE RESTRICTED OUR
DEVELOPMENT TO ONLY
ONE OF THESE
TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED LEGS.
OKAY, BRUCE,
NOW LET'S TRY
RUNNING FIRST.
UH, THAT'LL BE
FINE, BRUCE.
BRUCE,
PLEASE JUMP FOR US.
DESPITE SOME MINOR
RECRUITMENT DIFFICULTIES
CAUSED BY OUR RECENT
P.R. PROBLEM,
I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND
THAT YOUR UNIT
WILL MEET THE HIGHEST
OF STANDARDS.
PYNCHON.
YOUR MEN, DIXON.
SAM SMITH,
DISGUISE EXPERT.
GRETTA ATTENBAUM,
SWIMMING EXPERT.
GRETTA DEFECTED TO US
AFTER THE LAST OLYMPICS.
WE FEEL SHE'S GONNA BE
QUITE AN ADDITION
TO THE DEPARTMENT.
GREG COLBURN,
UNDERWATER EXPERT.
THE FOURTH MEMBER
OF YOUR UNIT,
LT. FINLETTER,
IS WINDING UP
HIS CURRENT MISSION.
HE'LL CONTACT YOU
AT THESE COORDINATES.
EXPECT HIM
AT "10-100" HOURS.
GOOD LUCK, DIXON.
CAN YOU, LIKE,
BELIEVE HOW HE WAFFLES
ON EVERY ISSUE?
Woman #2:
OH, RIGHT ON.
WE'LL NEVER HAVE
ANOTHER PRESIDENT
AS BAD AS THIS ONE.
- (women screaming)
- WHAT IS IT? OVER THERE!
NO! NO!
MR. DANIELS,
I REALIZE THAT
IN THE PAST,
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME QUESTIONS RAISED
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S
USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS
FOR WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER
PERSONAL ITEMS.
HOWEVER, I CAN SAY WITHOUT
FEAR OF CONTRADICTION
THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
AND AT NO TIME
HAS THE CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION EXPENDED
ANY PUBLIC MONIES
WHATSOEVER
FOR THE PURCHASE OF
THE FLUFFY FLOWER-PRINT
TOILET PAPER.
NOW, IF THERE ARE
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS...
THANK YOU,
MR. PRESS SECRETARY.
MR. SECRETARY!
MR. SECRETARY!
JUST A MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN.
ONE MORE QUESTION.
THE LITTLE FELLOW
IN THE REAR.
BOBBY JENKS, SIR,
P.S. 149.
I HAVE A QUESTION, SIR.
CERTAINLY, YOUNG MAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?
WE'VE HEARD NOTHING AT ALL
ABOUT THE GROWING
TOMATO MENACE.
I...
UH...
WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT
A MENACE, YOUNG MAN.
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
ISOLATED REPORTS
ALLEGED INCIDENTS INVOLVING
SOME UNUSUAL ACTIVITY
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, UH,
PARTICULAR VEGETABLE,
BUT I ASSURE YOU
THAT, UH,
THIS IS NOT AND NEVER
WILL BECOME A MENACE.
HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT,
LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED,
HAS CALLED UPON OUR MOST
NOTED CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS
IN THIS FIELD
TO BEGIN A THOROUGH,
INTENSIVE, PAINSTAKING,
AND EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION
INTO THE BACKGROUNDS
AND ORIGINS OF THIS
INTERESTING QUIRK
OF NATURE.
FURTHERMORE, YOU CAN ASSURE
ALL OF YOUR YOUNG READERS THAT
THIS WILL NEVER BECOME A PROBLEM
THAT AMERICANS NEED FEAR.
THIS, UH, MEETING OF
THE SENATE INVESTIGATING
COMMITTEE'S
CALLED TO ORDER.
ANYBODY REMEMBER
WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE INVESTIGATING?
- THE TOMATOES, WAYNE.
- WHAT WAS IT?
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THOSE TOMATOES.
OH, YES, YES.
YES, OF COURSE. YES.
WELL, THERE'S ONE FOR YOU,
ONE FOR YOU,
ONE HERE FOR ME,
ONE FOR YOU.
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ONE FOR EVERYBODY.
WONDER WHERE
IT COULD BE.
Woman:
GOOD MORNING, CITY HERALD.
MAY I HELP YOU?
ROBERTS!
- SIR?
- GET ME GOLDSTEIN.
- HE'S STILL
IN BEIRUT, SIR.
- BEIRUT?
YES, HE'S FIRED, SIR.
OH. YEAH.
GET ME JOHNSON.
SORRY, SIR. HE'S COVERING
THAT TRIAL IN TEXAS.
OH, CRIPES!
OKAY, JUST GET ME ANYBODY
IN THE SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT DESK.
THEY'RE ALL ON
SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.
GODDAMN IT!
WHO THE HELL IS HERE?
WELL, UH,
THERE'S YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU, JULIUS.
WAIT A MINUTE.
- THERE'S FAIRCHILD.
- WHO THE HELL IS HE?
"SHE." SIR.
LOIS FAIRCHILD,
SOCIETY SECTION.
THE NEW KID?
SOCIETY, HUH?
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
SEND HER IN.
NOW, DAMN IT!
Man:
HEY, LOOK. IT'S A FUNKY
LITTLE TOMATO.
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- TAKE THE OLD MISSION ROAD.
SOME CRAZY-ASS BIKER
HAS GOT HIMSELF MUNCHED ON
BY A HERD OF TOMATOES.
- SO WHAT CAN WE DO?
- WE CAN KEEP IT QUIET,
THAT'S WHAT.
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
THE POLICE RADIO?
IT'S SOLID TOMATOES
BETWEEN HERE AND HOLTVILLE.
WE'RE LIABLE TO GET KILLED!
WILL YOU CAN IT,
YOU LITTLE PUD-PULLER?
IF JOHN Q. PUBLIC FINDS OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING DOWN,
WE'RE BOTH
AS GOOD AS DEAD.
FAIRCHILD, SIR.
- HMM?
- FAIRCHILD.
YOU SENT FOR ME?
OH. YEAH, YEAH.
HAVE A SEAT.
FAIRCHILD,
I'VE BEEN KEEPING
MY EYE ON YOU.
YOU'VE GOT
A GOOD SENSE
OF ORGANIZATION.
THANK YOU, SIR.
- FLUID STYLE.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- SHARP MIND.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- A NICE ASS.
- THANK...
I'M ABOUT TO
GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE,
YOUR FIRST
BIG ASSIGNMENT,
AND I EXPECT YOU
TO USE
EVERY ATTRIBUTE
AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
I'M SURE THAT WHAT
YOU LACK IN EXPERIENCE
YOU'LL MORE THAN
MAKE UP FOR IN...
DETERMINATION.
NOW,
THIS WILL GIVE YOU
THE NECESSARY BACKGROUND
TO HANDLE
THE ASSIGNMENT.
GO TO IT.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.
UH, ONE MORE THING,
FAIRCHILD:
I'M CERTAIN
THE GOVERNMENT WILL GO
TO UNBELIEVABLE LENGTHS
TO ENSURE THE SECRECY
OF THIS THING.
GOOD LUCK.
- (Siren wailing)
- (tomatoes gibbering)
HELP! HELP!
DO YOU READ ME?
DO YOU READ ME?
GO AWAY! GO AWAY!
- DO YOU READ ME?
DO YOU READ ME?
- ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?
YOU KEPT IT SO GODDAMNED
SECRET, NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THE HELL WE ARE!
- DO YOU READ?
DO YOU READ?
- HELP ME! S.O.S.!
GIVE ME THAT,
FOR CHRIST SAKE!
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
TO SHUT UP! I QUIT!
WHAT? YOU CAN'T QUIT!
THE DEPARTMENT...
SCREW THE DEPARTMENT!
I'M GONNA DIE!
YOU CONCEITED
LITTLE S.O.B.,
I'M GONNA DIE TOO!
- GOOD! GOOD!
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD...
- (clattering)
NOT GOOD, MR. PRESIDENT.
NOT GOOD AT ALL.
FRANKLY, I WAS NOT
OVERLY IMPRESSED
WITH THE LEVEL
OF COMPETENCY DISPLAYED
BY THE SCIENTIFIC TEAM.
I HAVEN'T SEEN DIXON'S
SPECIAL FORCES UNIT YET,
BUT IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE
WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR,
I'D SAY WE'RE IN FOR
A BIT OF TROUBLE.
Man:
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, JIM.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
IT'S LIKE TRYING
TO STACK BIBLES
ON WHIPPED CREAM.
- YES, SIR.
- JIM, AN UNUSUAL PROBLEM
CALLS FOR
AN INGENIOUS SOLUTION.
I THINK
I'VE GOT ONE.
JIM, HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD OF MINDMAKER?
CERTAINLY, SIR.
THE ADVERTISING AGENCY
YOU USED IN YOUR CAMPAIGN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW,
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
GET REELECTED,
ESPECIALLY AFTER
IT GOT OUT THAT I USED
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
AS COLLATERAL
ON THAT ARAB LOAN.
- YES, SIR.
- BUT...
I'M SITTING HERE NOW,
AND I OWE IT ALL
TO MINDMAKER.
INCIDENTALLY, JIM,
YOU WERE IN THE MIDEAST
LAST SUMMER.
TELL ME, HOW DOES
THE OLD GIRL LOOK
IN THE DEAD SEA?
- JUST GRAND, SIR.
- GOOD.
I TELL YOU, JIM,
IF THOSE FELLOWS
COULD ELECT ME,
- THEY CAN DO ANYTHING.
- YES, SIR.
JIM, I WANT YOU TO FLY
TO NEW YORK IMMEDIATELY.
I WANT YOU TO SEE
TED SWANN.
BELIEVE ME,
THE MAN'S A GENIUS.
I'M ON MY WAY, SIR.
THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY.
SAY, WOULD YOU WANT
TO BUY A USED CRIB?
I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT I APPRECIATE
THIS INFORMATION.
THIS COULD BE
ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN...
FAIRCHILD, FROM THE TIMES.
WHAT'S THIS DEAL
ABOUT TOMATOES?
- LOOK, BUDDY, DON'T TRY
AND STONEWALL ME.
- Man: HI THERE, LOIS.
OH. HI, CLARK.
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
- UH, NO COMMENT.
- AND WHO'S HE?
- NO COMMENT.
- HOW SERIOUS IS
THIS SITUATION?
- NO COMMENT.
- THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.
- Man: UP, UP, AND AWAY!
YOU CAN'T IGNORE
THE PRESS.
DIXON!
DIXON!
DIXON!
DIXON!
Man (on radio):
HEY, GUYS, HERE'S THE SONG
EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING FOR:
RONNY DESMOND'S
"PUBERTY LOVE."
Man (high voice):
* PUBERTY, PUBERTY LOVE
Man:
OH, WOW,
WHAT IS THAT?
OH, NO! DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S THE SONG.
PLEASE, OH!
TURN IT OFF!
OH, IT'S TORTURE ON THE EARS!
I CAN'T STAND THAT NOISE!
Man:
QUIET! I WANT
TO HEAR THE NEWS.
Man (on radio):
AND TODAY, THE PRESIDENT
CLOSED THE NATION'S
LAST REMAINING SUB BASE
AT GROTON, CONNECTICUT.
WHEN ASKED WHY HE HAD MADE
THE STARTLING DECISION,
THE PRESIDENT RESPONDED,
"THOSE FUNNY LITTLE
BLACK SHIPS
JUST KEEP SINKING ANYWAY."
AND IN OTHER NEWS TODAY,
IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,
A MAN WAS EATEN BY A BACON,
LETTUCE AND TOMATO SANDWICH.
YOU'RE FREE!
Man:
GERONIMO!
HMM.
SO YOU'RE
FINLETTER, HUH?
I'M MASON DIXON,
AND THIS IS...
MY GOD!
IT'S ADOLF HITLER!
THIS IS SAM SMITH.
HE'S OUR
UNDERCOVER EXPERT.
HE'S ONLY DISGUISED
AS ADOLF HITLER.
GUTEN MORGEN,
HERR HITLER.
- AUTOBAHN.
- SPRECHEN ZE DEUTCHE?
WEINER SCHNITZEL.
GET IN THE BACKSEAT!
WHAT ABOUT ME, MR. DIXON?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
YOU...
YOU...
YOU GO DISGUISE
YOURSELF
AS A TOMATO
AND INFILTRATE
THEIR CAMP.
YES.
THANK YOU.
- HI.
- MR. RICHARDSON
TO SEE MR. SWANN.
YES, SIR.
HE'S EXPECTING YOU.
I'LL LET HIM
KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
MR. SWANN?
MR. RICHARDSON
IS HERE TO SEE YOU.
HE'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.
JIMBO, BUDDY!
HOW ARE YA?
HOW YOU DOIN'?
- FINE. I, UH...
- SUPER, SUPER.
HEY, THE PRESIDENT
TELLS ME YOU HAVE
A SITUATION, JIMBO.
WELL, LET ME CLUE YOU:
YOU BOYS HAVE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
LET ME GIVE YOU A PEEK
AT MINDMAKER IN ACTION.
FIRST, WE HAVE TO CONVINCE
THE LITTLE HOUSEWIFE OUT THERE
THAT THE TOMATO WHICH
ATE THE FAMILY PET
IS NOT DANGEROUS,
NO PROBLEM.
THEN WE HAVE TO CONVINCE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES
THAT THE THOUSANDS MISSING
FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES
WERE MERELY STRANDED
DURING THEIR
BICENTENNIAL PILGRIMAGE
TO PHILADELPHIA.
NO PROBLEM.
THIRD, THE PRESIDENT
WANTS US TO DO THIS
IN SUCH A WAY
THAT IT CAN BE COVERED UP,
AND NO ONE WILL KNOW
IT EVER HAPPENED.
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
BUT THEN HE WANTS US
TO DO THIS
AND CONVINCE
200 MILLION AMERICANS
THAT THIS DISASTER
IS ACTUALLY A BLESSING.
NOW, THAT'S A CHALLENGE.
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
MR. SWANN.
THE PRESIDENT IS A VERY
DEMANDING PERSON.
SOMETIMES HE EXPECTS
THE IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT I DON'T...
I NEVER SAID "IMPOSSIBLE,"
RICHARDSON.
WHAT I SAID WAS THAT
IT WAS A CHALLENGE.
MAN WAS PUT ON THIS EARTH
TO MEET CHALLENGES,
MY BOY.
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN DO IT?
CAN I DO IT?
CAN I DO IT?

WELL, LET'S GO MEET
THAT CHALLENGE,
YOUNG MAN.
I'VE ALREADY PUT
MY STAFF TO WORK,
SO IF YOU'D BE GOOD ENOUGH
TO STOP BY IN THE MORNING,
WE CAN TAKE A LOOK-SEE
AT SOME OF THE
PRELIMINARY SKETCHES.
ROLL IT.
Man (on recording):
THEN I CAN TELL THE PRESIDENT
YOU'LL ACCEPT THE ASSIGNMENT.
YOU BET YOUR BOOTIES.
TRAFFIC COPS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
MEET THIS CHALLENGE
DAY TO DAY.
THIS MAN IS LIKE
ANY OTHER POLICEMAN
ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.
HE WORKS HARD
AND TAKES PRIDE
IN SERVING PEOPLE.
YES, HE'S A POLICEMAN
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER,
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:
HE IS BLIND.
(Crashing, tires screeching)
Woman:
THIS HAS BEEN
A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
PRODUCED FOR THE NATIONAL
HEALTH FOUNDATION.
SIR, I REALLY
DON'T THINK THIS IS
A GOOD PLACE TO CAMP.
WE'RE NOT SLEEPING
ON THE SIDEWALK.
DO YOU SEE THAT BIG
BUILDING OVER THERE?
IT'S CALLED A HOTEL.
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO
SLEEP IN THE HOTEL.
NO CAMPFIRE, SIR?
NO CAMPFIRE.
WELL, THEN, WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THESE MARSHMALLOWS?
HERE'S THE KEY TO MY ROOM.
I'M GONNA CHECK FOR MESSAGES.
BE UP IN A MINUTE.
YES, SIR.
PARDON ME.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MESSAGES
FOR MASON DIXON
IN ROOM 401?
EXCUSE ME.
MAY I HAVE THE KEY
TO ROOM 401?
I... I SEEM TO HAVE
MISPLACED MINE.

WILL YA?
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.
MARSHMALLOW?
OH. I'M...
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I-I MEAN, I THOUGHT
THIS WAS MY...

Dixon:
WHAT WAS THAT?
- A STRUMPET, SIR.
- A WHAT?
A HARLOT. A TROLLOP.
A LADY OF THE EVENING.
GO TO SLEEP,
FINLETTER!
HMM?
WH-WHAT?
WHERE?
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
- BREAKFAST, SIR.
- NO TIME!
- BUT... YOUR VITAMINS.
- NO TIME!
NOW, LISTEN.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO DOWN
AND WARN GRETTA THAT THERE'S
TOMATO ACTIVITY IN SECTOR 2.
YOU GOT THAT?
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU TELL HER.
- YES, SIR.
- Man (on radio):
WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM
TO BRING YOU
A SPECIAL BULLETIN.
THE FOLLOWING IS AN NBS
HOTLINE BULLETIN
WITH DOUGLAS KEIKLER
IN NEW YORK.
NBS... THE NETWORK
THAT BRINGS YOU
THE NEWS
AS IT HAPPENS,
BRINGS YOU THESE BULLETINS
IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY,
THE NEWS YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW IT,
ON NBS,
THE NETWORK
OF THE NEWS.
THIS NBS NEWS
HOTLINE BULLETIN
IS BROUGHT TO YOU
BY SCHRITZ BEER.
YOU'RE NEVER TOO DRUNK
TO ASK FOR SCHRITZ.
AND BY BRIGHT GUMS,
THE TOOTHPASTE
FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT
TEETH OR DENTURES.
AND BY...
WHAT IS IT, SPOT?
WHAT'S IN THERE?
Spot:
GOSH, BILLY,
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU STAY THERE.
I'LL GO LOOK.
- SPOT? SPOT?
- (rustling)
- WHAT ARE THOSE
RED CIRCLES, SIR?
- MACHINE GUN EMPLACEMENTS.
WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE VALLEY
SURROUNDED WITH THEM.
I DON'T THINK
WE CAN HOLD THEM
VERY LONG, THOUGH.
AND THAT GREEN LINE,
THAT'S THEIR FURTHEST
POINT OF ADVANCE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- UH-HUH. WHAT ARE
THE BLUE DOTS?
THOSE ARE MOBIL STATIONS.
- OH.
- (vehicle approaching)
THAT MUST BE
MAJOR MILLS.
- TAKE OVER.
- YES, SIR!
I'M GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT, SIR.
- I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT WILL INTEREST YOU.
- SO I'VE BEEN TOLD.
DIXON, I WANT YOU
TO SEE THIS.
CAPTAIN?
YES, SIR.
SIR,
WE'VE CAPTURED
A GIANT TOMATO.
I'M AFRAID, GENTLEMEN,
THAT WHAT WE HAVE
HERE BEFORE US
ISN'T WHAT WE THOUGHT.
YOU DON'T MEAN...
THIS,
MAY GOD HELP US,
IS A CHERRY TOMATO.
- (Screaming)
- (roaring)
MR. DIXON
HAS ORDERED ME
TO INFORM YOU
THAT THERE'S
TOMATO ACTIVITY
IN YOUR SECTOR.
ALL RIGHT,
WHO WANTS TO BE
PAPER MONITOR?
I'M TELLING YOU, J.B.,
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
THE FIRST ADULT
BREAKFAST CEREAL:
KINKY CRISPIES.
COMES IN THREE
DELICIOUS FLAVORS...
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. SWANN.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK,
J.B. BYE.
JIMBO!
HOW'S IT GOING?
I BELIEVE THAT'S
MY QUESTION.
RIGHT. FUN-NY!
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,
WE'VE BEEN GOING
GREAT BANANAS.
SIT DOWN, MAKE
YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
I ASKED MYSELF,
"WHAT DO WE NEED?
"SOMETHING ORIGINAL,
SOMETHING THAT STRIKES
AT THE VERY HEART
OF THE MATTER."
AND HERE IT IS!
MINDMAKER AT ITS BEST!
WHO CAN ARGUE
WITH THAT?
AND THERE'S MORE.
LISTEN TO THIS.
Man (on recording):
GIANT TOMATOES MEAN
BIGGER PIZZAS!
- Man #2: ROLLING ON 2.
- * IF YOU'RE FEELING
SAD AND BLUE *
* TOMATOES END IT
ALL FOR YOU *
LAST YEAR,
MORE PEOPLE WERE KILLED
BY AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS,
HEART ATTACKS,
LUNG CANCER,
AND NATURAL CAUSES
COMBINED
THAN BY
ANY ONE TOMATO.
PRETTY CLASSY, HUH?
WITH A CAPITAL "K."
RIGHT.
AND MR. SECRETARY,
BEING A PUBLIC RELATIONS
MAN YOURSELF,
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE VALUE OF SYMBOLS.
WELL, WE HAVE
SPENT A GREAT DEAL
OF TIME AND EFFORT
AND OVER A MILLION DOLLARS
TO CREATE A SYMBOL
WHICH WILL WAGE THIS BATTLE,
AN EFFORT THAT WILL
BECOME KNOWN AS
THE "STOP TOMATO
PROGRAM."
I SEE.
IT ALL LOOKS QUITE...
EXTRAORDINARY.
- THANK YOU.
- NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
- I THINK I'LL BE
ON MY WAY.
- JUST A MOMENT.
ONE MORE THING
BEFORE YOU LEAVE,
MR. SECRETARY.
I'D REALLY LIKE YOU
TO SEE THIS.
IT'S SOMETHING
I'VE WORKED ON
FOR MANY YEARS,
THE CULMINATION
OF YEARS OF EFFORT:
THE WORLD'S
ULTIMATE COMMERCIAL.
ROLL IT.
Man (deep voice):
HI.
JESUS CHRIST
FOR TECHNITRON.
Man (on radio):
THE NATION IS IN CHAOS.
CAN NOTHING STOP
THIS TOMATO ONSLAUGHT?
LAST NIGHT, TOMATOES
ATTACKED LOS ANGELES...
BOSTON.
SEATTLE.
CHICAGO.
EVEN THE MERE MENTION
OF THE WORD
IS SUFFICIENT
TO INDUCE PANIC.
TOMATO.
MORE NEWS
AT THE HOUR.
NOW BACK TO THE ROCKING SOUND
OF THE BOOBER ON SUPER 101.
Man #2:
ALL RIGHT! MAN, THAT'S
REALLY SOMETHING, HUH?
HEY, EVERYONE,
I'M GONNA PLAY SOMETHING...
THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S NUMBER ONE
IN THE CHARTS THIS WEEK...
THE HEAVY SOUND
OF RONNY DESMOND'S
"PUBERTY LOVE."
* PUBERTY
* PUBERTY LOVE
* THERE IS NOTHING LIKE
PUBERTY LOVE *
WHILE THE FEDERAL
AGENCIES INVOLVED
HAVE DECLARED
-(snoring)
- THAT THE NECESSARY INFORMATION
HAS NOT BEEN FORWARDED
TO STATE AGENCIES
FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE
REVIEW AND APPROVAL,
WE CANNOT IGNORE LOCAL PLEAS
FOR INTER-GOVERNMENTAL
COOPERATION
- (snoring)
- IN WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY
AN AFFAIR
BEST SUITED FOR
INTERNATIONAL ACTIONS.
- (Snoring)
- THIS IS A QUESTION
BEST LEFT TO PEOPLE
FOR WHOM THERE IS
NO SPOKESMAN GREATER
THAN THOSE WHO SPEAK...
Dixon:
AND THEN I PUT
MY FOOT TO THE FLOOR,
AND I GOT OUT OF THERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.
IT WAS ALL VERY STRANGE.
I... I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.
YOU MADE NO UNUSUAL
MOTIONS OF ANY KIND?
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
ODD.
WERE THERE ANY LOUD NOISES
OR OTHER EXTRANEOUS ACTIVITY
WHICH MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED
THE TOMATOES' BEHAVIOR,
SUCH AS AN AIRPLANE
OR ANOTHER CAR
IN THE VICINITY?
I'M ALMOST SURE
THERE WASN'T.
-(Snoring)
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN,
I REALLY HAVE TO BE
GETTING BACK TO WASHINGTON.
THAT'S FINE.
GIVE MY REGARDS
TO THE PRESIDENT.
- I'LL DO THAT, CAPTAIN.
- IT'S "MAJOR."
OF COURSE.
PRIORITY-ONE MESSAGE
FOR MR. DIXON, SIR.
- A PHONE CALL FOR YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.
I'LL NEED ONE OF THOSE
FOR MY RECORDS TOO.
I'LL NEED ONE
FOR MY FILES.
AND DON'T FORGET
THE MAJOR.
- YEAH?
- TROUBLE, SIR.
- HELLO?
- TROUBLE, SIR.
Both:
WHAT?
I HAVEN'T SEEN DIXON
ALL DAY.
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
HIS ASSISTANT, BUT THAT'S
GETTING ME NOWHERE.
- "FOLLOWED"? BY WHO?
- FOLLOWING WHO?
- HIS ASSISTANT.
- A SPY.
- A SPY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
Both:
WELL, WHAT'S
HE LOOK LIKE?
MEDIUM HEIGHT,
MEDIUM BUILD.
IT'S A "SHE," SIR.
YOU KNOW, THE STRUMPET
LAST NIGHT.
- THE ONE WITH THE BIG...
- GUNS AND A SWORD...
- WITH LONG, BLONDE...
- PARACHUTE...
- SUNGLASSES...
- COMBAT BOOTS...
- AND A DRESS.
- NOTHING SUSPICIOUS
ABOUT THAT.
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
- WHAT SHALL I DO?
LOOK, I THOUGHT I MADE IT
PERFECTLY CLEAR.
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE MADE USE
OF ALL YOUR POTENTIAL,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
LOOK, YOU'RE
OBVIOUSLY TIRED.
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE A NAP?
- YOU MEAN, GO TO BED?
- I COULDN'T DO THAT!
- WHY NOT? YOU'RE A WOMAN.
- I RESENT THAT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
YOU WERE INCOMPETENT.
I JUST THINK
YOU COULD USE A REST.
YES, SIR.
BUT I...
WELL, I'LL DO
MY BEST, SIR.
- GOODBYE.
- GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.
OPERATOR?
OPERATOR, I, UH...
I'VE GOTTEN
A WRONG NUMBER.
- I'D LIKE MY DIME BACK.
- (high-pitched chattering)
HI, THERE.
HELLO.
LISTEN,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN...
IT WAS A DARK NIGHT.
I MEAN,
THE LIGHTS WERE OFF,
AND IT GOT DARK.
I MEAN, IT WAS DARK,
AND IT WAS LIGHT EARLIER.
YOU WANT TO
GO TO BED?
UH, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?
- UH...
- I'VE GOT TO GO TO BED.
Newspaper editor's voice:
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE MADE USE
OF ALL YOUR POTENTIAL,
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.
ALL YOUR POTENTIAL.
(echoing) POTENTIAL.
POTENTIAL. POTENTIAL.
I, UH...
I WAS RIGHT.
I WAS RIGHT!
A SPY!
DID YOU WARN GRETTA?
UH, YES, SIR,
BUT SHE WAS
ALREADY DEAD.
IT FIGURES.
Man (over intercom):
ATTENTION. ATTENTION.
THE 56th COMBAT
SUPPORT GROUP
WILL DEPART
AT 0900 HOURS.
ALL 3rd DIVISION PERSONNEL
REPORT TO THE 5th DIVISION
STAGING AREA.
ALL 5th DIVISION
PERSONNEL REPORT TO
THE 3rd DIVISION
STAGING AREA.
WILL THE DRIVER
OF TANK 38421
PLEASE GO TO
THE PARKING LOT?
YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON.
- HAD A FEW SETBACKS
DURING THE NIGHT.
- SERIOUS?
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
YOUR POINT OF VIEW.
DID YOU HAVE
ANY RELATIVES
IN WYOMING?
SAY AGAIN?
"ARKANSAS"?
ARE YOU SURE?
ARKANSAS.
Dixon:
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?
PRIME INTELLIGENCE
TELLS US
THAT THE TOMATOES
ARE AMASSING FOR
A FINAL
ALL-OUT ATTACK
ON THE NATION.
OUR TOP BRASS WANTS US
TO CONCENTRATE OUR FORCES
HERE ON THE COAST.
IF WE CAN
HOLD THEM HERE,
WE CAN WIN.
- IF NOT...
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO, MAJOR?
YES. THE PRESIDENT WANTS
YOUR PERSONAL REPORT.
CALL HIM ON THE RED LINE
AT 1100 HOURS.
BE BACK HERE TONIGHT.
WE'LL NEED EVERY MAN
WE CAN GET.
DAMN IT, DIXON,
THIS IS WAR!
VERY GOOD, SIR.
SIR, I...
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
SHOOTING AT YOU.
- WHERE DO YOU THINK...
- (bullet ricochets)
SO YOU CAN SEE,
MR. DIXON,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO MAKE OUR STAND
OUT WEST.
AND I WANT YOU
TO MAKE SURE THAT
OUR MILITARY PEOPLE
OUT THERE IN THAT REGION
UNDERSTAND AND ARE AWARE
OF THEIR ENORMOUS
RESPONSIBILITY.
I'M SURE THEY ARE,
MR. PRESIDENT.
President:
BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN
JIM RICHARDSON OUT THERE?
Dixon:
JUST BRIEFLY.
HOW'S THE AD CAMPAIGN GOING?
EXCELLENT.
MY MAIL'S RUNNING
30 TO 1 IN FAVOR
OF THE TOMATOES.
TERRIFIC.
OH, GOD,
I ALMOST FORGOT.
- SHIRLEY?
- Woman: YES, SIR?
I WANT YOU TO GET
GENERAL MITCHELL
ON THE LINE.
TELL HIM TO BOMB
NEW YORK CITY.
BUT, MR. PRESIDENT,
THE TOMATOES ARE NOT EVEN
CLOSE TO NEW YORK CITY.
LISTEN, YOU WORRY
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS,
AND I'LL WORRY
ABOUT MINE.
YES, SIR.
- IS THAT THE LAST PEN?
- YES, SIR.
THANK GOD.
HEY, WILL SOMEBODY
PLEASE PASS THE KETCHUP?
AS YOU WERE.
Man:
ORDER, ARMS.
THE MEN LOOK READY,
MAJOR.
AS READY AS THEY'LL
EVER BE, DIXON.
YOU KNOW, DIXON,
A MAN STOPS TO THINK
AT A TIME LIKE THIS
ABOUT HIS HOME,
HIS WIFE, HIS KIDS.
- YOU MARRIED, MAJOR?
- NO.
ME EITHER.
I WONDER WHAT
THE TOMATOES ARE
THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.
* WE STOPPED

STAND BY OVER HERE
FOR JUST A MINUTE, HUH?
OKAY, DON'T GO AWAY.
WE START WITH
A TIGHT SHOT, HUH, BILL?

DON'T RUN OFF.
ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION,

BY THIS TERRIBLE
TOMATO ONSLAUGHT.
- MRS. WILLIAMS, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR HUSBAND IS MISSING.
- YES, HE IS.
- DO YOU THINK HE'S DEAD?
- WELL, I...
- WILL YOU MISS HIM?
WILL YOU MARRY AGAIN?

WHAT IF HE'S LAYING
IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE
- WITH BOTH LEGS BROKEN,
CALLING YOUR NAME?
- (crying) STOP!
YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER MAN, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE NO SPRING CHICKEN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO,
MRS. WILLIAMS?
- CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUEST...

PLEASE LOOK
INTO THE CAMERA.
Mrs. Williams (wailing):
GET AWAY FROM ME!

THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

WE'LL GET THEM,

Richardson:
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. DIXON.
HAD A PLEASANT NAP?
RICHARDSON.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
MR. DIXON,
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
YOU WOULD BE.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.
WHAT DO YOU INTEND
TO DO WITH ME?
MR. DIXON,
DON'T BE SO NAIVE.
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT CAN STOP ME.
DON'T BE A FOOL, RICHARDSON.
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.
YOU KNOW VERY WELL
I DO.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY, DIXON.
NO MAN SITS
CLOSER TO POWER
THAN THE PRESS SECRETARY
TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
AND YET
AS CLOSE AS IT IS,
THAT POWER
IS NEVER REALLY
WITHIN YOUR GRASP.
IT DANGLES
BEFORE YOU,
TAUNTING, DARING,
MOCKING YOUR
VERY IMPOTENCE.
I WILL NOT BE
MOCKED ANYMORE!
I WILL NO LONGER GIVE
OTHER PEOPLE'S ANSWERS
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
QUESTIONS.
THE ANSWERS
WILL BE MINE.
THE QUESTIONS
WILL BE MINE.
EVERYTHING
WILL BE MINE.
IT'LL BE GLORIOUS,
DIXON.
IT'S TOO BAD YOU WON'T
BE AROUND TO SEE IT.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN
CONTROL THESE TOMATOES
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE?
QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS.
YOU MISSED
YOUR CALLING.
MR. DIXON, HAVE YOU
HAD LUNCH YET?
HERE.
HAVE A TOMATO.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
IT'S REALLY QUITE SMALL
AND QUITE HARMLESS.
IT'S FROM
MY GARDEN.
YOU MIGHT SAY
THAT I'M...
IN TUNE
WITH MY TOMATOES.
AT THE PROPER TIME,
WHEN ALL VESTIGES
OF AUTHORITY
HAVE DISAPPEARED,
I SHALL CHARGE IN
ON MY WHITE STALLION
AND SAVE THE NATION,
OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
MY FELLOW CITIZENS WILL BE
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.
AT THE VERY LEAST,
THEY'LL SURELY CHOOSE
MY BENEVOLENT LEADERSHIP
OVER THE OBVIOUS
ALTERNATIVE.
IT SHALL BE
MY GOLDEN MOMENT.
BUT, MR. DIXON,
I'M AFRAID THESE ARE
YOUR FINAL MOMENTS.
YOU'RE AWFULLY CONFIDENT
FOR A MAN WHO HAS
FAILED TWICE.
THREE TIMES,
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?
I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU KNOW, DIXON,
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
I'VE NEVER KILLED
A MAN BEFORE.
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
WHO'S THERE?
Man:
U.P.S. PACKAGE FOR YOU.
COME IN.
THEN AGAIN,
- YOU MAY BE WRONG.
- WAIT.
BEFORE YOU PULL
THAT TRIGGER,
TELL ME HOW
YOU DO IT.
REALLY.
HOW MELODRAMATIC.
VERY WELL.
IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.
- (Footsteps running)
- YOU SEE, ALL I DO IS...
A REAL BAD APPLE, SIR.
IT'S A GOOD THING
WE GOT HIM.
FINLETTER!
FINLETTER!
WE'VE GOT TO ROUND UP
EVERYBODY IN THE CITY.
YOU GOT THAT?
AND MEET ME IN THE STADIUM.
THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE.
BUT, SIR,
EVERYBODY'S LEFT TOWN.
THE ONLY PEOPLE LEFT
WILL BE CRAZY PEOPLE.
I DON'T CARE!
JUST DO IT! MOVE!
SIR...
THEN IT'S
UNANIMOUSLY AGREED
THAT THE COMMITTEE
RECOMMEND
THAT NO FURTHER ACTION
WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME.
I'VE GOT IT!
I'VE GOT IT!
HEY, GUYS, LOOK!
THEY'RE STARTING TO COME!
THEY'RE COMING!
TURN ON
THE RECORD PLAYER!
COVER YOUR EARS!
EVERYONE!
* PUBERTY, PUBERTY LOVE

IT'S WORKING, IT'S WORKING!

(tomato growling, gibbering)
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.
JUST DOING
MY JOB, LADY.
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S NOTHING

GOODBYE, MISS FAIRCHILD.

ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
THEY'RE GONE NOW.

How we doing, Richard?
We should pass over the English coast
15 minutes ahead of time, sir.
Well, with this load on our back, that's good going.
Just trust the RAF, sir.
- What the hell is that?
- The shuttle ignition.
Disappeared? And what happened to the Moonraker?
Good God.
Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away.
Moneypenny, is 007 back from that African job?
He's on his last leg, sir.
Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop.
I don't think I'm ever going to fly with anyone else.
You're so right, Mr. Bond.
This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond.
A little premature, isn't it?
Enjoy your flight.
- Good morning, Moneypenny.
- James.
But why are you so late?
I fell out of an airplane without a parachute.
- Who's in there?
- Q and the Minister of Defense.
You don't believe me, do you?
- And you should go right in.
- Yes, Moneypenny.
- 007. At last.
- Good morning, sir.
I think you know Frederick
Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Commander.
- Minister. Q.
Moonraker?
- What do you know about Moonraker?
- What I read in the newspaper, sir.
Then you'll know that
Moonraker, the space shuttle, was being flown over here on loan from the Americans on the back of a 747.
Yes, which crashed somewhere in the Yukon, aircraft and shuttle totally destroyed, correct?
- That's the official version.
- The truth is rather more disturbing, 007.
Look at this.
Now, that's the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn over a large area.
That's all that's left of the fuselage.
We've been through it with a fine-toothed comb, but there's no sign of
Moonraker, not a trace.
Are you suggesting the shuttle was hijacked in midair?
That's for you to find out, 007.
The shuttles are built in
California by Drax Industries.
Yes. We were responsible for the safety of that shuttle, Commander.
The United States government is justifiably concerned.
I can imagine. Then, California must be the place to start.
- I agree.
- Don't make any mistakes, 007.
The situation is critical. We've got to find that shuttle.
Yes, sir.
If that's all, gentlemen...
Just a minute, 007. I've got something for you.
Roll up your right sleeve, will you?
This is now being issued as standard equipment.
Strap it on your wrist.
It's activated by nerve impulses from the wrist muscles.
Like this?
Oh, thank you, 007.
- Be careful, will you?
- Yes, Q.
Ten darts, five blue-tipped with armor piercing heads, five red-tipped, cyanide coated, causing death in 30 seconds.
Very novel, Q. You must get them in the stores for Christmas.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Welcome to California, Mr. Bond.
- I like it already.
My name is Corinne Dufour.
Oh, and you're going to be showing me around, are you, Corinne?
No. I'm just a humble pilot in the service of the Drax Corporation.
This is the Drax estate now. Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax.
- Owns a lot, doesn't he?
- What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.
We're approaching the main complex now.
That's where the Moonraker shuttle is made?
That's right, workshops, hangars, design and experimental blocks, test centers, everything.
Very impressive.
I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed with the conquest of space.
Now, I can believe it. Good Lord.
The Drax residence. Every stone brought from France.
- Cute, isn't it?
- Magnificent.
Why didn't he buy the Eiffel Tower as well?
He did, but the French government refused him an export permit.
Look there. Those are the astronaut trainees.
Mr. Drax is financing the entire training program out of his own pocket.
He seems to have an eye for a good investment.
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in the drawing room, Miss Dufour.
- Thank you, Cavendish.
- This way, please, sir.
Mr. Bond, sir.
- Mr. Bond.
- Mr. Drax.
Allow me to present, before they leave us, Countess Lubinski,
Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond.
How do you do?
Well, my dear fellow, your reputation precedes you, of course.
I'm honored that your government should send you on so delicate a mission.
Delicate, Mr. Drax?
Well, to apologize in person for the loss of my space shuttle.
How would Oscar Wilde have put it?
"To lose one aircraft may be regarded as a misfortune,"
"to lose two seems like carelessness."
Well, an apology will be made to the American government, Mr. Drax, when we've discovered why there was no trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage.
And your loyalty commands respect, Mr. Bond.
You have arrived at a propitious moment, coincident with your country's one indisputable contribution to Western civilization.
Afternoon tea.
- May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?
- Thank you, no, nothing at all.
The shuttle, is it made entirely here in California?
No. I own a number of subsidiaries throughout the world, producing components.
The conquest of space represents an investment in the future of the entire human race, Mr. Bond.
It is, therefore, logical to seek out the best that each nation has to offer.
- Are you referring to people or skills?
- Both, Mr. Bond.
- Am I too soon?
- Not at all.
I'm sure Mr. Bond is eager to start his tour.
Miss Dufour will escort you to
Dr. Goodhead who will show you around.
Ask anything you like.
- Thank you for being so cooperative.
- A pleasure.
Look after Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him.
You'll find Dr. Goodhead first on the right.
- Oh. Thank you for the ride.
- Call on me if you need anything.
Good afternoon.
- Can I help you?
- Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond. I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.
- You just found her.
- A woman.
Your powers of observation do you credit, Mr. Bond.
James, to my friends.
Holly Goodhead.
- Are you training to be an astronaut?
- I'm fully trained.
On loan from NASA, the
Space Administration.
Well, Mr. Bond, I guess we'd better get started.
You don't want to lose time as well as a space shuttle, do you?
This is it, the Moonraker.
Capable of being launched into space by rocket...
Orbiting the Earth and reentering the atmosphere to land like any conventional aircraft.
This is the centrifuge training.
It simulates the gravity force you feel when shot into space.
The speed is controlled by the instructor from up there.
Why not try it?
Why not?
- Strap yourself in firmly.
- Yes, Doctor.
Now your arms.
That's to prevent you from knocking yourself out.
I see.
How fast does it go?
It can go up to 20 Gs, but that would be fatal.
Three Gs is equivalent to take-off pressure.
Most people pass out at seven.
You make a great saleswoman.
You don't have to worry. This is what we call a "Chicken Switch."
You just keep your finger on that button, the moment the pressure gets too much for you, release the button
- and the power's cut off.
- Just like that?
Come on, Mr. Bond. A 70- year-old can take 3 Gs.
Well, the trouble is there is never a
70- year-old around when you need one.
- You want me?
- Mr. Drax says to telephone him.
All right, I'll call him from my office.
You go ahead. I'll be right back.
The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.
Yes. We're taking good care of him.
I don't know what could've happened.
Something must've gone wrong with the controls.
Let me help you.
My mother gave me a list of things not to do on a first date.
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.
No. What do you want then?
Would your feelings be shattered if I were to say information?
- Why should I tell you anything?
- Why, indeed?
You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond.
What goes on here besides the manufacture of Moonraker?
And the astronaut training program?
There are other laboratories, but not much is happening now.
No?
They were working on something very secret, but everything's been moved.
Where to?
I don't know.
What about that list of your mother's?
I never learned to read.
What are you doing?
You whetted my appetite for information.
Is there a safe in here? Thank you.
James, no.
That's amazing.
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.
Eighteen karat.
You must go.
Well, you go first. I'll turn off the lights.
Thank you.
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.
My dear Bond.
This is Mademoiselle Deladier and La Signorina del Mateo.
- Ladies.
- I'll see you at lunch.
A pity you leave us. Such good sport.
Unless you're a pheasant.
Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun, a stray bird may fly over.
I only stopped to thank you for your hospitality.
Fraser will get you to the airport in plenty of time.
Come now.
- I doubt if I'm in your class.
- Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond.
Over there.
You missed, Mr. Bond.
Did I?
As you said, such good sport.
You called for me, Mr. Drax.
You were with Bond last night in my study.
No, I...
- You showed him the safe.
- I didn't.
I'm terminating your employment.
You will leave immediately.
Franco, I'll call you to tell you where to meet me.
Could I interest you in something?
Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately.
But I think maybe I'd better have a look around.
Please. Go anywhere you wish.
And in 1955, the Venini
Museum and Glass Works was taken over by Drax Industries.
And here, ladies and gentlemen, we have some of the rarest examples of the glassblower's art.
As you know, everything was done absolutely by hand.
Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati, sometime between 1850 and 1860. If you'd like to follow me over here.
This exquisite bowl was fashioned about 1520, over 450 years ago.
If it ever came on the market, it would certainly fetch a price in excess of one million American dollars.
But if any of you are thinking of taking it...
Now, we have here a very early 17th century dish with an aquamarine medallion.
Over here, we have something very, very interesting.
This glass-handled sword, the only one of its kind in the world, was owned by General Menotti in the late 18th century and is the work of Bruno...
14th century.
Dr. Goodhead.
I can only hope your presence here is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.
- I dislike being spied on.
- Well, don't we all?
You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you?
- Yes. How did you know?
- Well, I like to keep abreast of things.
May I ask what you're doing in Venice?
I'm addressing a seminar of the
European Space Commission.
My, heavy stuff.
But there again, I keep forgetting that you are more than just a very beautiful woman.
If you're trying to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.
I have more important things on my mind.
That's what I'd like to talk to you about.
- Dinner this evening?
- This evening I'm giving my address.
Well, then, can you think of reason why we don't have a drink afterwards?
Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall.
Franco.
Play it again, Sam.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Convalescing.
Your friend Cha just tried to kill me.
And you think I had something to do with it?
Well, the thought had flashed across my mind.
- What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?
- You leaving me your telephone number?
- I don't see the point.
Now I do.
Not what I want to get stuck with tonight.
James, why don't you pour yourself a drink?
Thank you.
Daily diary.
Fairly deadly diary.
Bollinger. If it's '69, you were expecting me.
Trifle overpowering, your scent.
Standard CIA equipment.
And the CIA placed you with Drax, correct?
- Very astute of you, James.
- Oh, not really.
I have friends in low places.
Could this possibly be the moment for us to pool our resources?
It could have its compensations.
Where are you planning on going from here?
I'm not planning on going anywhere.
Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly. We would be better off working together.
- Detente?
- Agreed.
- Understanding?
- Possibly.
- Cooperation?
- Maybe.
- Trust?
- Out of the question.
Send the night porter up for my bags immediately, please.
I hope you know what you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge with this fellow Drax.
007 doesn't usually push the panic button unless it's something serious.
- I should hope not.
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Good morning.
- I see you've covered everything
- with our Italian friends.
- Yes, sir.
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.
Gas masks?
We can't afford to take any chances, Minister.
Frederick Gray. What a surprise.
And in distinguished company, all wearing gas masks.
You must excuse me, gentlemen, not being English,
I sometimes find your sense of humor rather difficult to follow.
On behalf of the British government, I apologize.
I think you owe us an explanation, 007.
I've never been so humiliated in my life.
Your man should be taken off the assignment.
I'll see you at the consulate.
I'll have to do what he says.
Well, before you do that, sir, have Q do an analysis of this.
I took it from the laboratory.
Tell him to exercise extreme caution.
It is lethal.
So, there was a laboratory.
You better take two weeks leave of absence, 007.
Do have any thoughts about where you might go?
I've always had a hankering to go to Rio, sir.
I think I can recall your mentioning it.
007, no slipups or we're both in trouble.
Yes, a minor crisis has been averted.
No, no, nothing serious, but all merchandise is to be rerouted as from today.
Now, regarding a replacement for Cha, do you have someone in mind?
Oh, yes, well, if you can get him, of course.
Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro now boarding, gate number seven.
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.
- The President Suite.
- Really?
Well, don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost, I'll take a cab.
- Do you come with the suite?
- It depends who's renting it.
Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred.
Why were you following me from the airport?
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.
I work for Station VH. We have been asked to assist you.
M thinks of everything.
Tell me, Manuela, do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?
C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg.
They are very big importers in Rio.
A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.
They have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue.
I'd like to pay it a discreet visit tonight.
Tonight? I think you may find that a little difficult.
Difficult or not, it's something we have to do.
And meanwhile, how do you kill five hours in Rio if you don't samba?
- There's the warehouse.
- And not a soul about.
- I think there's a way around the back.
- Good thinking.
This is it.
Don't talk to any strange men.
I'll be back.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, but I'd rather dance with you.
I did tell you not to talk to any strange men.
- Did you find anything in there?
- Only this.
"Drax Air Freight."
Do you know which airport they operate from?
Yes. San Pietro. Do you want me to take you there?
No, I think you need some rest.
- Come on. I'll drop you off.
- Okay.
- Haven't we met before somewhere?
- The face is familiar, as is the manner.
It's become distinctly chilly since Venice.
Well, that was before you walked out on me.
Yes, nearly tripping over your suitcase on the way through the door.
So?
So why waste time working against each other?
I've checked Drax's warehouse in town.
It's empty.
That's no surprise. Since I've been here, those planes have been taking off every two hours.
- Yes. He's moving out.
- Where to?
That's what we're going to find out, now that we're working together.
- I still don't know if I trust you.
- I don't know if I trust you either.
That's what makes it more exciting, doesn't it?
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
But I'm sure we're better off out than in.
Bring that chain.
- Hang on, James.
- The thought had occurred to me.
I might have guessed.
- Do you know him?
- Not socially.
His name's Jaws. He kills people.
Here, give me the chain.
Come on. Hang on to me.
Jump.
- Have you broken something?
- Only my tailor's heart.
- What was that for?
- For saving my life.
Remind me to do it more often.
Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape.
Sorry about that.
James! You look as though you've just fallen off a mountain.
Well, it's funny you should say that, Moneypenny.
As a matter of fact, I was in a cable car and...
- Never mind.
- The other courtyard.
- There you are, 007.
- Balls, Q?
Bolas, 007.
- Good. Have that ready for Army Day.
- Yes, sir.
- Where's M?
- He's in the office over there.
This way.
- Good morning, 007.
- Good morning, sir.
- You're just in time. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.
- Q's come up with something.
- Splendid.
- Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
- Afraid not. Right, Q.
Well, it's a breakdown on that phial of liquid you picked up in Venice.
- You know, you seem to be right, 007.
- Thank you.
It's a highly toxic nerve gas that appears to have no effect on animals.
May I see the formula?
It's a chemical formula of a plant.
Orchideae anegra. A very rare orchid indeed.
Yes. It was thought to be extinct.
Until a missionary brought one back from the upper reaches of the Amazoco.
Well, actually he brought it back from the area of the River Tapirape.
Well done, James. You better get up there and fast.
And I've got something to get him there, if 007 can be trusted to look after it.
Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you.
You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.
Why did you break off the encounter with my pet python?
I discovered he had a crush on me.
Jaws.

What exactly are you up to here, Drax?
- And why the orchids?
- The curse of a civilization.
It was neither war nor pestilence that wiped out the race who built the great city lying around us.
It was their reverence for this lovely flower.
Because long-term exposure to its pollen caused sterility.
Correct, Mr. Bond.
As you discovered, I have improved upon sterility.
Those same seeds now yield death.
Not, of course, to animals or plant life.
One must preserve the balance of nature.
Moonraker launch program now commencing.

- Drax, one more thing.
You delivered a shuttle to the U.S. government, then you hijacked it. Why?
Because I needed it.
One of my own Moonrakers developed a fault during assembly.
Now, you have distracted me enough.
Jaws, Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim.
Place him where he can be assured of warmth.
- Confirmed.
- Moonraker Two, go for orbit.

Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, go.
It's all right. We're on a prearranged flight program.
That's Drax in Moonraker Five.
- What about the others?
- I don't know. Let's see.
We're all on parallel courses.
So, we must be headed for a rendezvous in orbit.
Let's see what cargo we have.
- The animals went in two by two.
- What do you mean by that?
Noah's Ark. This operation.
We're converging.
- Control rockets?
- Yes, we're slowing down.
What's that?
There's no image on the radar scanner.
An entire city in space and still nothing on the radar scanner.
- So nobody on Earth knows it's there.
- Right.
Drax must have a radar-jamming system.
All Moonrakers prepare to initiate docking procedures and continue radio silence.
Moonraker Six, you are now in manual.
Initiate docking sequence.
All shuttles now docked. Execute station activation procedure.

Those are the globes I saw in Venice with the nerve gas phials inside.
First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.
Here in the untainted cradle of the heavens will be created a new super-race, a race of perfect physical specimens.
You have been selected as its progenitors, like gods.
Your offspring will return to Earth and shape it in their image.
You have all served in humble capacities in my terrestrial empire.
Your seed, like yourselves, will pay deference to the ultimate dynasty which I alone have created.
From their first day on Earth they will be able to look up and know that there is law and order in the heavens.
All units, start Operation Orchid.
If we were visible from
Earth, they'd investigate.
Where do you suppose that radar-jamming system is?
We didn't pass anything on the way here, so let's try this way.
Station two, check coordinates, mode four.
Initiate globe launch timing sequence.
Orbital communicator, level 10.
Zero gravity.
This is it, the radar-jamming system.
- Coordinate conversion program.
- Check.
- Side lobe gain.
- Check.
- Spectral response.
- Check.
- Spin stabilizer correction factor.
- Okay.
Gigahertz reflector efficiency.
Solar photon screen.
Where did you learn to fight like that? NASA?
No, Vassar.
- Switched off?
- Permanently.
Now we can be spotted from Earth.
- This doesn't look good at all.
- It's over 200 meters in diameter.
Yes, yes.
Will you please listen, General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.
Neither did we, Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?
We've taken action already. We're sending up a vehicle to intercept.
Very well, but if we don't hear from you in the next 12 hours we take action ourselves and hold you responsible for the consequences.
We'll be in touch, General.
- Sorry to have woken you.
- I was already awake.
How can I sleep? Nothing but problems.
Problems, problems.
Marine astronauts to launch pad.
- Launch pre-program complete, sir.
- Launch globe number one.
T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir.
Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg.
There are no launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.
Well?
Jamming power supply and backup have failed, sir.
- Investigate immediately.
- Investigate number 28, immediately.
James Bond.
You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.
I didn't think there were any seasons in space.
As far as you're concerned, only winter.
And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead.
Despite your efforts, my finely wrought dream approaches its fulfillment.
Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare it is, hasn't a chance, Drax.
You think not? We shall see.
We're coming up to second launch position.
Launch globe number two.
No doubt you have realized the splendor of my conception.
First, a necklace of death about the Earth.
50 globes, each releasing its nerve gas over a designated area, each capable of killing 100 million people.
And the human race as you know it will cease to exist.
Then a rebirth, a new world.
U.S. spacecraft on course to intercept us, sir.
Activate laser. Prepare to destroy spacecraft.
You see, my dear Bond, we're well able to protect ourselves against all enemies.
Allow me to introduce you to the airlock chamber.
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route from this world to the next.
And you, Dr. Goodhead.
Your desire to be America's first woman in space will shortly be fulfilled.
Leaving you on your flying stud farm, conceiving your new master race?
If you like, yes.
And of course, anyone not measuring up to your standards of physical perfection
- will be exterminated.
- Certainly.
Interesting.
Most interesting.
Jaws, expel them.
Jaws! You obey me!
Expel them!
Hold them!
Sir, U.S. spacecraft, three minutes to intercept.
Stand by to laser it.
- Initiate firing sequence.
- Initiating.
U.S. spacecraft in laser range, 25.5 and closing.
Range 15.
Range 10.
Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two...
It's stopped rotating.
Open the cargo doors.
Number one platoon, EVA.
Number one platoon, EVA.
Let's try docking.
Colonel Scott will take the first landing!
Intruders have docked at satellite seven, sir.
Double the guard at every entrance in this satellite.
Report intruders' progress throughout the space station.
Number three globe ready for launching, sir.
Proceed!
Group One, attack enemy.
All units shoot to kill.
- Colonel Scott, don't shoot.
- Hold your fire.
Corridor five penetrated. Intruders advancing on Command satellite.
Maintenance crew needed, section three.
At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery.
Desolated, Mr. Bond?
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.
Allow me.
Take a giant step for mankind.
- Where's Drax?
- He had to fly.
How's Scott doing?
He's got control of the Command satellite.
We put the launching gear for the globes out of action.
When the station breaks up, they'll disintegrate.
They'll harm no one.
But the three that have gone, they'll kill millions.
Those three must be destroyed.
Come on!
Colonel, get your men off as quickly as possible.
Your mission is completed.
Sergeant, round up your men, get them back to the shuttle. Fast!
Back to the shuttle, everybody!
On the double!
Moonraker Five, that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser.
We can track those globes and destroy them.
It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.
All right, let's go.
Docking release system is jammed.
Release the door lock. I'll see if I can operate it manually.
It's jammed too.
Well, here's to us.
Jaws, we can't disengage. The docking release system is jammed.
Can you help us?
We're free.
Don't worry, they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.
Let's get a read-out on those globes.
I have the three globes on the screen.
We should have a visual in a minute.
There it is.
The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set.
One down, two to go.
Number two straight ahead.
What is it?
We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere.
In range.
- We should see the last one soon.
- There it is.
- It's getting hot.
- It can't be helped.
I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I should in order to catch that last globe.
I can't hold this course much longer.
We'll break up at 200,000 feet.
Just a few seconds more.
Automatic firing system negative. Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.
Controls aren't responding.
- The wings are beginning to glow.
- Just hold her steady.
Steady.
It's entering Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is our last chance.
Steady.
Colonel Scott reports picking up two survivors from the space station, a tall man and a short blonde woman.
Right. Okay.
Dr. Goodhead reported their position 20 minutes ago.
They're just coming into range of our tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean.
We should have audiovisual within a few minutes from the remote onboard TV monitors.
Houston calling Dr. Goodhead. Houston calling.
Confirm your position.
As this is the first joint venture between our two countries,
I'm having it patched directly to the
White House and Buckingham Palace.
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty will be fascinated.
- We have audiovisual.
- At last.
- My God, what's Bond doing?
I think he's attempting re-entry, sir.
- James?
- I think it may be time to go home.
Take me round the world one more time.
Why not?
Hey, kid!
Hey, Ismael.
Catch!
Such a pleasure to see you,
Herr Lieberman.
The pleasure is all mine,
Herr Strasser, I assure you.
I hate to bother such a famous
Nazi hunter, like yourself, with such trifle as the rent, but it is the third of the month.
Quite so, you will have a cheque in several days.
By all means, take your time,
Herr Lieberman.
Feel free to ignore your responsibilities, while my property is being ruined.
We have floods all over the building, because of you.
You overload the floor putting a strain on the pipes upstairs, and then they break.
The pipes upstairs break, and I'm to blame?
Everything is connected.
The whole building will soon collapse because of you.
- Ezra!
- Get out!
- You have no right...
- You have a call from Paraguay.
This is an apartment house, not an office building.
You have no right to bring in these heavy cabbinets in here.
All right, all right.
So next time rent to a feather merchant.
Hello.
Mr. Lieberman?
- Out! You understand!
- You get out!
Go and fix your rotten plumbing.
Barry Kohler? No, I don't think
I know you.
I sent you a package with photos.
You didn't?
You sound like an American.
What are you doing in Paraguay?
I've been monitoring the activities of a group of Nazis.
And I've identify several of them as war criminals.
Well, from your books and articles.
Forty years of heartbreak and sacrifice and you call it junk!
Yes, junk! Junk, junk!
Herr Strasser, we are wasting valuable time.
The hole up there is very enormous.
Huge chunks of plaster are coming down from your ceiling.
Look, how I step on the ground.
Quite soon I will be through into your apartment, right into the lap of your beloved wife. God forbid.
- Come.
- Don't push me.
Leave my brother and me alone.
Get out!
Come, Herr Strasser.
Esther, the man's an idiot.
No, I'm an idiot for letting him make me angry.
- Go on, take your phone call.
- Oh!
The young man who's just discovered there are Nazis in South America.
So, Mr. Kohler, forgive the interruption.
I work alone like you,
Mr. Lieberman, which is why I'm calling you.
You see, I'm onto something.
Mr. Kohler, it maybe a blinding revelation to you, that there are Nazis in Paraguay, but I assure you, it is no news to me.
And if you stay there much longer, there will still be Naziss in Paraguay, but there will be one less Jewish boy in the world.
Something's going on.
They seemed to be gathered for some kind of operation.
A bunch of them have been moving in and out of Ralph Gunther's estate.
I want to know what to do next.
Get on a plane and go home, or better still go to the American Embassy, run to the American Embassy and tell them to put you on the plane.
Thank you for your advice.
What did he want?
I don't know.
Advise, instructions.
A boy like that. Lucky to survive one day in Paraguay!
He's been there some weeks.
I told him to go home, anyhow.
What does he want, applause?
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two.
- One, two.
- One, two.
- Goddamn, it works!
- Goddamn, it works!
Come on, damn you, tune in.
Gentlemen, he's coming.
So, Gunther, this is the moment.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, be at your ease, I beg of you.
- Gunther, would you do the honours?
- Certainly, Dr. Mengele.
Mengele.
Captain Gerhart Mundt.
Yes, yes, I have heard nothing but the highest praise for you, captain.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
- Major Ludwig Trausteiner.
- Thank you for coming, Major.
- Captain...
- All right, Gunther.
Captain Farnbach and I are old comrades.
Are we not, captain?
It is extremely flattering to be remembered after all those years, sir.
I am not so senile, or so ungrateful that I cannot remember a loyal officer from the early days of the struggle.
And now for the youth.
This is Dietrich Hessen, son of Wilhelm Hessen.
Welcome, young man.
- Wolfgang Kleist.
- I am pleased you are with us.
Thank you, Herr Doktor.
- And Otto Schwimmer.
- A great pleasure, Herr Schwimmer.
And now to business.
Sit down, gentlemen, please.
The task before you
is the most important operation
that the Kamerades organization
has ever undertaken.
It is the vital link in a programme to which I and your leaders have devoted many years of huge effort.
Your success on this project carries with it the hope and destiny of the Aryan race.
And that is not an exageration, but the literal truth.
It is a holy mission, gentlemen.
You should consider yourselves highly honoured to have been chosen to perform it.
Now for the details.
In the next two-an-half years, ninety-four men must die on or near certain dates.
Sixteen of these men are in West Germany, fourteen in Sweden, thirteen in England, twelve in the United States, ten in Norway, nine in Austria, eight in Holland, and six each in Denmark and Canada.
A total of ninety-four assassinations.
All of these men
will be sixty-five years old
when their dates come around.
Obviously, a few of them will already
have died of natural causes.
Yes, Farnbach.
Who are these men?
Jews?
Not one.
They are all family men, tax inspectors, civil servants, school principals, men of minor authority.
Are we permitted to hire
accomplices?
Accomplices?
I would not advise it.
Bear it in mind, these are
sixty-five year old men.
Their eyesight is failing, they have
slow reflexes, diminished strength.
I've been through Sweden quite a bit, but I've never heard of this place,
Rasbo.
It is a village. About fifteen kilometres from Upsala.
That is Bertile Hayden, the post master, there.
And by killing this old mail man
I will be fulfilling the destiny of the Aryan race?
You wish to be relieved of this assignment, captain Mundt?
No, sir.
Then, do not question your orders.
Simply obey them.
Yes, Herr Doktor.
I apologise.
Further questions?
The men's families are not
to be involved.
And in the case of say younger
wives
who might be open to romantic
overtures as accomplices.
I repeat, the families are not
to be involved.
You will travel and live in a manner
befitting
salesmen, for large German firms.
You'll have more than enough money for any equipment you might need.
It is vital that you check in with headquarters on the first...
Find it!
Find it!
Sir!
All right, Mr. Lieberman, listen to this.
Killing this old mail man,
I will be fulfulling the destiny
of the Aryan race?
Operator, any word of my call yet?
Hello.
Kohler!
I thought I told you to leave.
Well, I didn't Mr. Lieberman, but I think you're going to be glad I didn't.
Doktor Josef Mengele was here tonight.
You mean to tell me you've called me up at 3 o'clock in the morning to tell me Doktor Josef Mengele is in Paraguay?
I know that, Mr. Kohler, so does my sister, so does my landlord, and my tailor, and now you know it too.
My congratulations!
He came to a meeting at Gunther's house tonight.
The others were there too.
Mengele's sending them out to kill ninety-four, sixty-five year old men in the next two-an-half years.
What are you talking about?
Ninety-four at sixty-five... two-an-half years.
I can hear you, Mr. Kohler, I just can't follow what you're saying.
Goddamn it, you don't have to
believe me, I've got it all on tape.
All of them, Europe, Canada,
the United States.
Mostly civil servants.
Okay, I'm running it down now.
It'll only take a second.
Take your time, old men don't go back to sleep once they've been awakened.
- Welcome, young man.
- The stuff on now, it's just a lot of introducing and glad handing around.
Mengele is acting like chairman of the board.
Will you stop asking questions and just listen Mr. Lieberman?
Okay, here it comes.
The task before you is
the most important...
Kohler!
Are you there, Kohler?
Kohler!
... your success on this project...
Kohler.
Clean the room.
Dispose of the body.
I do not want a trace of this vermin to remain.
Everything is all right, you can take care of the police.
- Who was the boy calling?
- It does not matter.
- Perhaps you should wait?
- We wait for nothing, the fourth Reich is coming, Gunther.
Our men will leave tomorrow as planned.
Kill him.
Is there no way of checking this further?
All right, thank you.
The Vienna telephone exchange says there was a call from Paraguay, but Paraguay say that no such call took place.
I have finally found a couple of things from that boy.
Mundt!
Captain in a Death-Head Regiment.
Farnbach, a Gestapo agent.
Trausteiner! Assistant commandant, at Dachau.
Cheap bureaucrats and murderers.
And these... who knows.
- Ezra, you know, you shouldn't.
- Esther, Esther, after all I've been through, one puff won't hurt me.
These...
Colonel Eduard Seibert, he's the adjutant to Rausch, the head of the Kamerads organization.
He was in command of the extermination units on the Eastern Front.
He's a real aristocrat, what's he doing in such undistinguished company?
And then, it wasn't a hoax after all.
Esther, on the telephone, after that boy was cut off,
I felt something... something in the silence, something alive, and... hateful.
Maybe, I'm getting senile.
You haven't got the time.
Ninety-four... ordinary men.
Beynon!
Oh, Christ!
Mr. Beynon, so nice to see you again.
- How are you getting along?
- Can't complain, who'd listen.
- May I take up a moment of your time?
- I'm so sorry, I'm late for lunch.
Oh, always such a prodigious appetite.
What?
Eight times last week I call you and each time you are at lunch.
Maybe you have a tate warm?
Now, Sidney, please, just a few moments of your time.
Very well, come on.
Ezra, you carry this whole damn concentration camp thing pinned to your coat-tails.
Why do you keep knocking yourself out?
Nothing ever pays off.
Frieda Maloney is in jail.
Frieda Maloney! She was only a guard in a camp.
She strangled young girls with their own hair, bayonetted infants.
- Maybe she was a despicable criminal, but she just isn't news thirty years later.
Sidney, there is a plot by the Kamerads Organization, which is the illegal army...
Yes, I know what it is.
They plan to kill ninety-four men in the next two-an-half years.
Jews, I suppose?
I want your European, Canadian and American bureaus to send you clippings of all sixty-five year old civil servants who die accidentally.
You pass them to me and
I'll go through them.
And whose plot is this?
Josef Mengele.
He's the red herring in this little barrel?
What a title for the chief doctor of Auschwitz who killed two-an-half million people, experimented on children, Jewish and non-Jewish, using twins mostly, injecting blue dyes into their eyes to make them acceptable Aryans.
Ezra.
Amputating limbs and organs from thousands, operating without anaesthetic, but with the strenght of Wagner providing an obligato to the screams of the mutons he was creating.
Don't lecture me!
Sidney, you owe me something.
Even if only to humour an old man who once brought you page one international story.
You owe me this much, Sidney.
Now, I'm collecting.
Have you any idea how many men in their mid-sixties, die every day?
I try not to think about it.
Save it for your wife,
Herr Doring.
What I've got is too good for her.
I can feel that, Herr Doring.
Go on, go on.
Pig.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Seibert!
News?
Good news, our salesmen have all checked in.
The first quotas have been filled, all on the exact dates.
Two a day early and one a day late.
Splendid, splendid!
Come.
We'll have a nice lunch.
Colonel, I will need to have a full report on all this for my records.
I've already taken care of that.
Four out of seven on the exact dates.
They are good men.
Well chosen.
General Rausch called me yesterday from the Costa Brava.
Why didn't you tell us about Lieberman?
I did not think this was necessary.
The General is concerned.
But Ezra Lieberman, no one takes him seriously.
Even the rich Jews who used to send him money, have found better ways to ease their consciences.
The man's bank has failed, his followers have fallen away from him.
He's entirely without credibility,
I just decided he was not important.
If you'll forgive me, Herr Doktor, it was not your decision to make.
You could have compromised their agents all over the world.
And if I have told you about Lieberman, you would have compromised my project.
How bad would it be if we postponed for three or four months?
That would reduce the outcome by... twenty percent, there are 18 men in the first four months it would change the results completely.
Assuming that there is an outcome.
There'll be exactly the results
I have promised.
General Rausch wanted to recall these six men.
Impossible!
Until we find out how much
Lieberman knows.
Impossible, this project has a timetable that muste be observed, it cannot be changed.
Herr Doktor...
Colonel, do you fully understand what it is that I have done?
I, the outlaw, the so-called war criminal.
Right here in this God-forsaken place,
I have created a scientific miracle.
I have turned the whole world into a laboratory.
Our laboratory.
Don't talk me about six men.
I would send out six more if they were caught, and six more, and six more, until the task was done.
I agree, Herr Doktor, I agree.
I hope that we can resolve this Lieberman business, and that you get to put 94 check marks on that beautiful chart of yours.
Come.
Walk me to the plane.
You see how passionate I am on this subject.
Uh huh!
To think that one day this place will be a shrine to be visited by millions of school-children.
Yes, that is a nice thought.
Yes, Doktor.
Gladbeck, three-thirty, Ezra.
We'll get there, we'll get there, when do I ever miss a train?
Now you know what to do while I'm away?
Go through all those clippings, separate them by countries, cities, try to isolate all violent crime.
Ezra, there are already more than a hundred clippings and Beynon called to say there are more to come.
Well, we have to start somewhere.
Yes, yes, but we can't afford to hunt for all those men.
Well, that's why I'm going to these cities first, because they are the closest and the cheapest, it's the begining.
Yes, but you know that...
Remember to separate the ones in New England from the rest.
I can cover them while I'm on the lecture tour.
Still, without any help.
Without help, without money, without time, what else is new?
The landlord!
Where are you going?
- To turn that damn tape off.
- Leave it, I like music.
Well, he doesn't.
He'll prowl round the landing listening at my door,
- just waiting to catch me.
- Catch you? Doing what?
Just what we're doing now, love.
Mr. Harrington doesn't like any mucking-around in his house, he has a wife and kid, you know.
Old coot!
Bet he wouldn't say no if I invited him in here.
Then maybe we'll invite him in.
Later.
Is this Frau Doring's residence?
My name is Lieberman.
Good.
I think she's off the phone by now.
You're her grandson?
Her son.
Herr Lieberman!
Frau Doring, thank you so much for seeing me.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
You are the same man they had on television, several months ago.
The Nazi hunter.
Frieda Maloney.
Do you kill Nazis when you catch them?
That's against the law, it's much better to put them on trial
- so people can learn.
- Learn what?
Who they were, what they did.
So why even catch them?
Just put it all in history books.
Clever boy you have here,
Frau Doring.
Yes, but definitely lazy.
For example, right now he should be in his room practising.
I can't be in my room and answer the door at the same time, can I?
Oh! I was only teasing, darling.
Now, please go and practise.
Now we can talk.
First of all, may I express my sympathy, things must be very difficult for you right now.
Thank you.
Is he your only child?
Yes.
Did your husband leave all his money to Erich and you?
And to a sister of his.
Why do you ask that?
I was looking for a reason behind his death.
Emil's death was an accident.
Was he a Nazi?
I did not meet him until 1955, so I have no way of knowing.
Did he ever mention the name of a Doktor Josef Mengele?
Who?
There was a considerable age difference between you two.
That wasn't the only difference.
I was twenty, straight off the farm and he was Mr. High-an-Mighty of the Transport Commission.
Forty-three, I think he was.
- Did he have any hobbies?
- No.
Yes.
Yes, he did have one special hobby,
Herr Lieberman.
He humiliated and beat my son at every given opportunity.
Would you like me to tell you who really killed him?
God.
To set free a stupid little farm girl after twenty-two years of unhappiness.
Do Nazis answer prayers,
Herr Lieberman?
No.
That is God's business.
And I have thanked him every night, since he pushed Emil under that car.
He could have done it sooner.
But I thank him anyway.
Who the hell are you?
Come in, Mr. Harrington.
She wants to talk to you.
I'll talk to her.
That would be nice.
John!
John!
Simon, stop playing with those puppets and go and wash your hands for tea.
- Hallo.
- I'm on my way, mother.
If you'll hold on, I'll just get her.
Nancy!
Nancy! Telephone, Nancy.
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Come on, Nancy, you can't spend your life in bed.
Nancy!
Good, good, incredibly precise.
Everything right on schedule.
You didn't have to make the trip,
Seibert, you could have used the radio.
Not that I do not welcome a little intelligent company down here.
Gunther remembered the digital clock you admired so much in his home.
Well, thank you, my friend.
Very nice of you.
Such a rational device.
- Remarkable.
- There is a problem.
Lieberman.
He was in Gladbeck, in Doring's house.
Possibly he found out about Doring.
You don't know?
How could I?
- The boy, Kohler?
- Impossible.
Then, how did Lieberman get to Doring?
Sheer coincidence.
That's not a very scientific explanation, is it, Doktor?
Are you interrogating me, colonel Seibert?
General Rausch put me in charge of security for this project.
How can I function, if I don't have all the facts?
But you do!
A nosey, incompetent, old Jew has bumbled onto one victim, what more do you have to know?
Any idiot could see the next logical step. Kill him!
We don't want to create a martyr.
Ridiculous!
Besides, he could have contacted various police agencies, or intelligence services.
They would not pay any attention to him.
If he died suddenly, they would.
Well.
Then, what are you going to do?
Lieberman will have to be watched more carefully from now on.
If he seems to be getting closer to us, a decision will be made.
We will balance the danger of killing Lieberman against the scientific validity of your project.
Are you, my esteemed
Chief of Security telling me that a project twenty years and millions of dollars in the making, will be dropped because of this insignificant impudent, old Jew?
It wouldn't do to antagonize me,
Doktor Mengele.
I've been one of your few supporters, since this Lieberman business began.
And should I drop to my knees in gratitude?
Listen to me, Seibert,
I will not permit you to lay your failure, or your fear at my door.
I am a scientist, I have done my job.
You are an executioner!
Do yours!
Ezra!
Oh! A reception committee.
How nice.
So, how did it go?
A very rewarding trip.
The Krassner death at Freiburn was a genuine accident witnessed by many people.
At Gladbeck, I met a young housewife who was not exactly heart broken by the death of her old husband.
And at Prozheim they slammed the door in my face.
That's the way it will probably be with most of these people.
- I know, come, let's get a coffee.
- Yes, please.
Excuse me, Mr. Lieberman?
My name is David Bennett.
I think you know a friend of mine,
Barry Kohler.
- Are you the boy who's been calling?
- What news of Mr. Kohler?
None.
- I know he was working with you.
- That's not correct.
- Well, he was in contact with you.
- How do you know that?
- From letters we received.
- We?
The Young Jewish Defenders.
They're a bunch of fanatics.
Kohler told me he worked alone.
Yes, and he did, thanks to you.
After he read all your books, he decided to change his methods.
I did not send your friend to Paraguay.
He sent me these.
To prove that he wasn't off on some wild goose-chase.
He couldn't identify these three young guys, so I traced them.
This is Kleist, Hessen, this is Schwimmer, members of a neo-Nazi organization in Paraguay.
This has nothing to do with me.
Does Barry Kohler's life have anything to do with you?
- You have no right to talk that way.
- Is Barry Kohler still alive?
- How do I know?
- Mr. Lieberman, Barry is dead.
You know that.
And I know that.
And that's why I'm here.
To pick up where he left off.
That means with you.
I work alone.
Im' not asking you for a job,
I simply want some information from you.
I can't help you.
I won't leave you until you talk to me.
I'm going to plant myself on your doostep, and I'll be waiting for you there every morning.
You're stuck with me, until you give me the information that I need.
Ezra,
I got another envelope of clippings from Beynon.
A big one.
All right, young man.
We'll talk.
Good morning.
I'm looking for the village of Storein.
You're going the wrong way.
Turn around and take the south road for about sixteen kilometres, then bear right, you can't miss it.
- Thanks.
- What are you doing in these parts?
- What?
- You are not Swedish.
I come from Don'tmund originally, but,
I live in Stockholm now.
I have spent some time in Germany myself.
Come now, Mundt!
What's happened to your memory?
My God!
Major Hartung!
I knew it was you!
Can't I believe it! What in the world
are you doing up here?
Well, it's no great story, my sister was married to a Swede.
And after I escaped from the internment camp, I hid out with them.
I am Lars Lofquist now, Inspector of the Power Company.
And now what about you?
I came up here on a job, for the Comrades Organization.
In Sweden?
My God, what's going on?
Can you tell me or would it violate orders?
What the hell with orders,
I'm sick of orders.
I'm up here in Storein to kill a school-teacher, on Saturday.
But don't ask me why, I cannot make head or tail of it.
Who is this teacher?
Lundberg? Olafsson?
Lundberg.
But I don't know what he looks like.
No doubt, he's probably a harmless old man, it doesn't make any sense!
It makes sense to your superiors or they wouldn't have given you the assignment.
An order is an order.
Good God, man! You are an officer of the S. S!
Have you forgotten?
My honour is loyalty.
Those words were supposed to be engraved on your soul.
I know Lundberg.
I will point him out to you.
It isn't Lundberg.
And it doesn't have to be Saturday.
No one would have wanted to kill Jack.
The man was beloved.
If you had seen the wreaths his students sent...
I have only one or two more questions to ask.
Did your husband belong to any international group?
He was in the American Legion.
Rotary.
I guess that's international.
The Legion sent a Colour Guard to the funeral.
The coffin was drapped in the American flag.
What are you doing out of bed?
I just came to get a glass of grapefruit juice.
He's got the flu, also I thought he could stay home a few days because of it.
This is Jack Curry Jr.
Just Jack Curry, now.
Jack, you bite your tongue.
This is Mr. Lieberman.
A famous man from Vienna in Austria.
- What's he famous for?
- This is fantastic!
You know you have a double.
A boy who lives in Gladbeck in Germany, exactly like you.
Exactly like me?
I never saw anything like it.
Two twin brothers could not be more the same.
Jack, you go up to bed, and
I'll bring you the juice.
- I want to find out about...
- You do what I tell you!
When you start paying the doctor bills, then you can hang around and get sick all you want, now just say goodbye and go.
Jesus Christ!
Goodbye.
You watch your mouth, young man!
It's amazing!
I thought he was this young boy from Germany come to visit you.
Even the voice, the look in the eyes.
Exactly.
Look, I don't want to be rude, but as you can see, I got a lot of things to do.
Look, I'm sure that nobody shot
Big Jack on purpose.
It was a horrible accident.
If you'll excuse me.
Hello, is this the Harrington residence?
Yes, this is the Harrington residence.
Can I talk to your mother, please?
Well, you could, but you can't.
This will only take a moment,
I promise you.
My mother isn't receiving today.
Well, perhaps if you told her that I...
Don't you understand English, you ass?
We are not at home.
Wilcox had two married daughters.
No, no sons.
The Harringstons, do they have any children?
What did the boy look like?
Sort of pale, he had straight dark hair, very dark, blue eyes.
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.
Why do you want to know about the kids all of a sudden?
Listen, Mr. Bennett, if you want to ask the questions, you pay for the phone call.
No, nothing.
No, I haven't found a link.
No, I'm in the dark.
Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow,
I promise.
Coming.
I have to speak to you,
Mr. Lieberman.
Well, come in. I was just coming to see you.
- Sit down.
- No, I can't stay long.
Jack Jr. Doesn't know where I've gone.
Mr. Lieberman, my son is the only thing I've got.
- You can't take him away from me.
- I have no intention of...
When you spoke about that boy in Germany, I got worried.
The lady who gave Jack Jr. To us, made us swear never to tell anyone.
- Your son's adopted?
- It's just that... she was a German lady.
She was very nice, really.
I was amazed when I read in the papers, about all the things you said she did.
Frieda Maloney.
Oh, God!
I knew I should never have come here.
Will you give me your word that you do not have any recording device in your briefcase?
Thank you.
Do you have the depositions?
I have brought one.
The agreement was that you would provide an advance look at all the testimonies against my client.
With particular regard to any scars, deformities, or disabilities, suffered by the witnessses.
Here. The deposition is brought in good faith.
Two others will come if the interview should prove satisfactory.
You realise how unjust all this is.
Mrs. Maloney has been married to an American citizen for 27 years.
She has two children, one grandchild.
I suppose this can be... corroborated?
By the mother of the child and three other surviving witnesses.
You will keep the interview brief.
You will discuss only my client's activities in America between 1964 and '67.
You will ask nothing about the charges against her or about any event that ocurred during, or directly after the war.
One question of that nature and I will immediately terminate the interview.
So.
I am to speak to you about my work with the adoption agency.
- That is correct.
- I don't mind.
What I did may have been slightly illegal, but,
I brought happiness to so many people and that's was important, huh?
Now tell me, if you will, how you came to work for this agency?
In the spring of 1963 I was contacted by someone
I knew in the Comrades
Organization.
Who?
Frau Maloney will not answer that.
They helped me after the war and wanted me to return the favour by getting a job in an adoption agency.
Did they say why?
If you let me finish, you'll find out.
The Rush-Gaddis agency hired me.
The Comrades Organization was interested in rejects.
Couples who had been denied children, because the husband was too old.
I was to go through the files looking for applications, specifically those of families with Nordic-Christian backgrounds, in which the husband was born between 1910 and 1914 and the wife between 1933 and 1937.
The husband had to have a job in something like civil service and both spouses had to be in perfect physical health.
Did they say why they wanted all this?
That information is not relevant.
I was expected to obey my orders, not to question them.
This I did.
As I always had.
About a year after that
I was ordered to contact several of the applicants and offer them a healthy white baby boy, complete with New York State adoption papers.
They were to pay me five hundred dollars and after their medical certificates had been cleared, they would receive the babies.
We would meet at a motel near Kennedy Airport, that used to be Idelwild.
The babies were delivered to me usually by stewardesses with Varig Airlines.
Varig?
Did the babies all come from Brazil?
- Is that important to you?
- No.
What did they look like?
They were all beautiful little boys, black hair, piercing blue eyes.
If you're looking for a long lost Jewish grandson, he was not among them.
How many couples did you give the babies to?
About twenty.
Only Americans?
- Some were Canadian.
- No Europeans?
No.
Can you remember a Curry family?
- Curry? Yes.
- Who else?
Wheelock.
Henry Wheelock.
He gave me my dog Schatzie.
Beautiful Doberman.
It was only ten weeks old when I got him.
Where is Wheelock from?
New Providence, Pennsylvania.
And how long after the Currys, did the Wheelocks get their baby?
That's fourteen years ago,
I don't remember.
And what has Josef Mengele to do with all this?
We won't answer that.
It was all a trick, wasn't it?
I know nothing of Mengele, but you'll link me with him, won't you?
You want your pound of flesh, you don't care how yuo get it!
Thirty years!
The world has forgotten!
Nobody cares!
And you persist!
And persist!
Now, why don't you get off my back?
- One more minor question.
- I'll say nothing to you.
As you wish.
This interview has not gone by any means to my satisfaction
I will therefore withold the other two depositions we talked about.
You lying Jewish schwein!
You're not a guard now, Madame!
You are a prisoner!
I may leave here empty-handed, but you are not going anywhere.
I think Frau Maloney could answer one more question.
When is your dog's birthday?
You are an insane old man after all, aren't you?
Schatzie's birthday? It was
December eleventh.
Have a safe trip, David.
Why?
Bye, bye.
...Mengele?
That was David, he's off to New
York for his sister's wedding, but he'll be back in a week.
Mengele... gives babies, fourteen years later he kills the fathers, he kills Doring, Harrington,
Curry.
And the Currys got their baby four weeks apart and the fathers were killed four weeks apart.
Wheelock.
Malone's dog was born December eleventh, ten weeks.
I've already worked it out,
February the twentieth.
That's only four days from now!
Wheelock, New Providence,
Pennsylvania.
How can I call Wheelock and tell him he's going to be killed by the people who gave him his baby?
That Josef Mengele has already killed the fathers of at least two other boys who happen to be twins?
Who would believe such a preposterous story?
Herr Doktor, how kind of you to come.
A pleasure to be here.
- Can this be little Elsa?
- Yes! You remember!
Last time I saw you were that high. You had whooping cough.
No, no.
I'm going to dance with your beautiful daughter.
Good evening, how are you?
May I present to you my wife Gertrud?
- My love, Herr Mengele.
- It's such an honour meeting you.
We're here on a little second honey-moon.
You're supposed to be in Krintianstad, getting ready to kill Oscarsson.
Traitor!
No!
He betrayed me!
He betrayed you!
He betrayed the Aryan race!
Get a doctor!
I am a doctor, idiot.
Don't you come near him!
Shut up, you ugly bitch!
- I thought you knew...
- Hold still, hold still.
Doktor Mengele.
Could I call you away from surgery for one moment?
If you'll excuse me.
And why was I not told that, that man was called back?
- All the men have been recalled.
- Recalled?
They should all be back here by the end of the week.
But why?
What has happened?
Lieberman visited Frieda Maloney in prison.
Lieberman again?
Will I be plagued to my dying day by that infernal Jew?
Maloney told him about the adoptions.
Well, that's not catastrophic,
Seibert.
She only knows about America, work can still continue in Europe.
The organization doesn't share your optimism, Herr Doktor.
But all Lieberman has are a few paltry shreds of information that he could not possibly piece together.
Eighteen of your subjects have died.
That means according to your figures that we can be sure of one, perhaps even two successes.
And if my calculations are wrong?
There's only one chance in twenty, or thirty.
No, Seibert, the men must go back.
They can't, the operation has been terminated.
Terminated?
By whose authority?
General Rausch and the Colonels.
I told you.
I told you from the beginning.
Kill him.
Kill him!
It would have been so easy!
It's gone beyond Lieberman, we don't know who else is involved.
You have betrayed me!
You're all... all a bunch of selfish old men who've lost your courage.
You only want to bask in the sun in your old age!
And if your Aryan grandchildren have to live in a world which is run by Jews, and Blacks, and Orientals, and slobs! You could not care less!
Your operation has been cancelled.
No!
Your operation has been cancelled!
Mine continues.
Heil Hitler.
This Mengele was sort of a primitive geneticist in his ons way, wasn't he?
I understand that he experimented on human beings.
Twins.
Then he was nothing more than a sadist really.
A sadis with a M.D. And a Ph.D.
Well, some people would say that's a perfect definition of a scientist.
What exactly do you mean when you say the boys you saw were more than twins?
Not only do they look alike, buy they were also very alike in personality.
That is unusual.
Studies show that twins who are separated at birth develop totally different personalities.
But these twins, or perhaps
I should say triplets because I believe that my associate saw another were like the same people, but brought up with different languages.
It's impossible, of course.
Excuse me doctor, but what is impossible?
What is impossible, doctor?
Mononuclear reproduction.
Doctor.
Cloning.
What if I were to tell you that
I could take a scraping of skin from you finger and create another Ezra Lieberman?
I would tell you not to waste your time, or my finger.
Anyway, that is cloning.
It was first done with plants.
A cutting taken from a plant and transplanted grew to be the exact duplicate of the donor plant.
Now we are doing the same thing with laboratory animals.
You mean, you can produce an animal from itself?
We take the unfertilized egg off an ovulating female and destroy all of its genes and chromosomes.
We then implant the nucleus of the donor cell which could be taken from a blood sample, or even a skin scraping.
That cell with its genetic material intact, eventually becomes an embryo and is born as a living creature.
Without parents?
Well, it has no father because the egg was never fertilized.
No mother, because its genetic code comes from another being.
Can you follow that?
And this creature, is an exact duplicate of itself?
Doctor, how can that be?
Come along.
Ous experiments began with the simplest of animals, shrimps and frogs.
Animals in which the female's eggs are fertilized externally.
Then we moved on to mammals.
We tried several laboratoty animals and found the rabbit most convenient.
I had to develop instruments which could accomplig the operation and a whole micro-injection system
I'll show you how it's done.
Here we are removing the eggs of white rabbit from the Fallopian tubes.
Now, you see the egg under a microscope.
I've brought the point of an ordinary sewing needle into view to give an idea of the size.
They are that small?
Most mammal eggs are about that size.
- Including human eggs?
- Yes.
The next step is to destroy the egg nucleus with ultraviolet light.
So that none of its genetic make-up remains.
Now you see an egg from a white rabbit ready to be injected with the blood cell from a black rabbit donor.
With the injection pipette one of the blood cells is sucked up and then injected into the egg.
After a few hours the eggs in culture divide and are ready to be put back into the female.
There, they grow into embryos, which in a month's time the normal gestation period, they will become baby rabbits.
In this instance, a black litter, from a a white mother and their black colour proves that they have been cloned from the blood cell of a black rabbit.
But, isn't it difficult to get the egg back into the female?
Transferring the eggs isn't a problem we do that all the time with laboratory animals.
The really tricky part is the micro-surgery.
Getting the donor cell into the egg.
You're lucky if one in ten survives.
This can be done with humans?
If the surgical technique were precise enough.
- It's monstrous, doctor!
- Why?
Wouldn't you want to live in a world full of Mozarts and Picassos?
Of course, it's only a dream.
Not only would you have to reproduce the genetic code of the donor, but the environmental background as well.
Is Mengele trying to reproduce himself?
No, he has brown eyes, and he comes from a very wealthy family.
Let's examine the family background of the donor.
The father is sixty-five years old.
Civil servant.
The mother is forty-two, you say?
She dotes on the child.
Spoils.
The boy is... pale... dark hair... blue eyes.
Spoilt.
Right?
Now, Mengele would certainly know every social and environmental detail would have to be reproduced.
Thus, if the parents were divorced when the boy was ten, this would have to be arranged.
Doctor Bruckner, the one who is cloned, the donor,
- he has to be alive, doesn't he?
- Not necessarily.
Individual cells taken from a donor can be preserved indefinitely.
With a sample of Mozart's blood and the women, someone with the skill and the equipment, could breed a few hundred baby Mozarts.
My God.
If it's really been done, what I'd give to see one of those boys.
Herr Lieberman!
Herr Lieberman.
Not Mozart, doctor.
Not Picasso.
Not a genius who would enrich the world, but a lonely little boy with a domineering father, a customs officer who was fifty-two when he was born.
And... an affectionate doting mother who was twenty-nine.
The father died at sixty-five when the boy was nearly fourteen.
Adolf Hitler.
Colonel Seibert.
You Lieberman?
Ja.
Come in.
Okay, boys.
Beautiful dogs.
Tear the throat out of anyone who even looks cross-eyed at me.
I guess you can see why I didn't exactly wet my pants when you said someone was out to get me.
Yeah.
Take off your coat.
Very impressive.
Yeah.
My son took those pictures.
Very good.
Very good.
A little artsy-fartsy, if you ask me.
- Is your son at home now?
- No, he's in school.
And Mrs. Wheelock, is she at home?
She's still at work.
So you're the guy who got that
Nazi Eichmann?
I located him.
It was the Israelis who did the actual kidnapping.
How much did you get for that?
Nothing.
I did it for the satisfaction,
I hate all Nazis.
I don't know about the Nazis.
The Niggers we got to worry about.
Hey, why are these Nazis after me?
Well...
You know, I...
I find it very hard to talk.
Don't worry about them, they won't bother you unless you bother me.
I was attacked by... by a dog when I was a child, a German shepherd, and I still feel uncomfortable with a dog in the room.
Jesus! You're like my neighbour
Wally.
I mean, he won't even walk up the driveway unless the dogs are lockep up.
Okay.
Come on, boys, in you go.
There's no other way that they can come in?
No.
Thank you.
I feel much better.
Hey!
Put your hands up.
What the hell are you up to, anyway?
Is there a basement in this house?
Yeah.
Take me to it.
Do you have any pictures of your son?
There's an album on the table.
What do you want them for?
Please, do not worry.
I am very anxious to see him and talk to him.
I am the doctor who delivered him.
Open the door.
Go down the stairs, Mr. Wheelock.
Now, listen, I don't give a doodily-shit about Jews or Nazis.
Good.
Tell me, please, which way to Quarryville?
Turn left at the end of the exit, it's beyond Thirty, take a left, it'll take you straight into Quarryville.
Thank you.
Quiet, damn you!
Bobby, dear, dear, boy.
Mr. Wheelock.
Mr. Wheelock.
Mr. Wheelock!
Mister...
You.
Herr Lieberman.
Get up, Jew!
Up!
Up!
Yes, I am going to kill you, but I want you to go to your death with the knowledge that all your efforts have gone for nothing!
I have the money, and
I have the will!
And no one can stop me!
Did you kill Wheelock?
No, he's in the kitchen, mixing us some cocktails.
Do you know what I saw on the television in my motel room at one o'clock this morning?
Films of Hitler.
They are showing films about the war, the movement, people are fascinated, the time is ripe.
Adolf Hitler is alive.
Tis album is full of pictures of him.
Bobby Wheelock and ninety-three other boys are exact genetic duplicates of him.
Bred entirely from his cells.
He allowed me to take half a litre of his blood and a cutting of skin from his ribs.
We were in a biblical frame of mind.
On the 23rd of May, 1943, at the Berghof.
He had denied himself children because he knew that no son could flourish in the shadow of so God-like a father.
But then he heard what was theoretically possible that I could create one day not his son not even a carbon copy, but another original!
He was thrilled by the idea!
The right Hitler for the right future.
A Hitler tailor-made for the 1980's,
'90's, 2000.
Kill!
Away!
Off!
No more gun.
Holy shit!
Bobby.
Bobby.
My dear, dear boy.
You cannot possibly imagine how happy I am, how joyous I am, to see you standing there so fine, strong and handsome.
Call these dogs off, Bobby, call the dogs off, please.
I'm an old friend of the family.
In fact I'm the doctor who delivered you.
And I stopped by, having just returned from abroad, and he let me in.
And then he pulled out a gun, fortunately I was able to overpower him.
Now call them off, Bobby, call them off, please.
Cut!
Cut, how clever.
I said, 'off', and I said, 'away' and
I said 'no gun, no more gun'.
- Then you had the gun.
- No, he had, he...
They're trained to attack anyone carrying a gun.
- They were locked up and let them out.
- The dogs are never locked up.
Bobby.
- My dear, dear...
- Action!
Cut.
Cut!
They won't listen to you.
Bobby.
That man is your enemy, don't listen to him, I beg of you.
Call the police.
Yeah.
By all means, do so, Bobby, but first there are some things about yourself you must know.
What do you mean?
If I prove to you that I know you better than anyone in the world, better even than your own mother, will you listen to me?
You are a clever boy.
Are you not?
You do not do well in school, that is because you are too clever.
Too busy thinking your own thoughts, but you are much smarter than your teachers, eh?
My teachers are nowhere.
You are going to be the world's greatest photographer, are you not?
Have you ever felt superior to those around you?
Like a prince among peasants?
I feel different from everyone sometimes.
You are infinitely different.
Infinitely superior.
You were born of the noblest blood in the world.
You have it within you to fulfil ambitions a thousand times greater than those of which you presently dream.
And you shall fulfil them, Bobby.
You shall.
You are the living duplicate of the greatest man in history.
Adolf Hitler.
Oh, man, you're weird.
Bobby, I'm telling you the truth.
- Find your father.
- What?
He killed your father.
Bobby, listen to me.
It was this vicious Jew, your sworn enemy.
He killed your father, and he came here to kill you.
Bobby.
Let me protect you.
All your power will burst forth when the time comes.
When you grow older
and you see the world engulfed
by human garbage.
When you feel this urge rising within you to save your own Aryan folk from extintion.
Then you will rejoice in your heritage
and bless me for creating you.
Bobby!
You must understand!
Your parents are of no importance!
They were chosen for you!
Now that they have served their purpose they must disappear from your life!
Bobby!
Bobby!
You freaked-out maniac!
Bite!
Bobby!
Holy shit!
Cut.
Cut!
Cut!
Hey, man!
Get out of here!
Out.
I think you'll die if I don't call an ambulance for you.
I could just go out right now, my mum won't be home until late.
You'll be dead by then.
If I call the police, will you tell them what I did?
Okay.
Shake.
Come on, shake.
Okay, you got a deal.
I'd like an ambulance and a police
car to the Wheelock residence
on Old Buck Road, please.
Hey, man, this is an emergency.
A heavy duty emergency.
David.
What a surprise.
Which one of the assassins was it, Mr. Lieberman?
I thought you went to a wedding.
No more deception now.
No more blind alleys.
All right.
It was Mengele.
He's dead.
It's over.
The Doring boy ins't dead yet.
Neither is Simon Harrington, nor
Jack Curry or Bobby Wheelock.
It took a little time, a little back tracking, a visit to Dr. Bruckner.
But now we know... everything.
And what are you going to do about it?
Kill the boys.
Brilliant man that Mengele.
I suppose he had all 94 of those names and addresses memorized.
Now, you are trying to fool me.
You have been searching the room.
- He must've had a list.
- He did, now I have it.
Give it to me.
Why?
We have the right and we have the duty.
To do what?
Kill children?
Give me that list.
You'll have to take it from me.
And when you do you can add my name to the list.
I don't mean you any harm.
You'll have to kill me, David.
The first of those boys that you touch,
I will turn you and your entire organization over to the police.
I swear I'll do that.
You would protect Hitler?
No.
Not... not slaughter the innocnet, and neither will you.
A fanatic you may be, but a murderer of young children you are not.
You know, there is a nurse here, an angel of mercy called
Miss Hanrahan, who actually gives me cigarettes.
You know, what she said to me the other day?
She said, 'Mr. Lieberman, if you can escape Buchenwald and you can escape those bullets, then a few cigarettes will not hurt you.'
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?
Mad.

- I am cold.
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.
- Oh, I feel dead.
Anybody ever tell you you look dead, man?
[ Mouthing Words ]
[ Parker ]
Oh, yeah, right.
Now, I just forgot something, man.
Before we dock,
I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation.
Right.
Brett and I, we think we oughta-
- We deserve full shares, right, baby?
- You see, Mr. Parker and I... feel that the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level.
Well, you'll get what you're contracted for like everybody else.
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.
[ Monitor Beeping ]
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.
Huh? Yeah, I saw it.

That's hard to believe.

What the hell are we doing out here?
I don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?
- That's not our system.
- I know that.
[ Loud Rumbling ]
[ Parker ] Do you ever notice how they never come down here?
I mean, this is where the work is, right?
Well, it's the same damn reason we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time.
That's the way they see it.
No, but- Listen, man.
Same old shit, man.
I think I know why they don't come down here.
It's because of you.
You don't have no personality.
Wonder what they want now.
What's going on down here?
Um, you happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
[ Wiping ]
[ Parker ]
What's happenin' now, baby?
Well, some of you may have figured out we're not home yet.
- We're only halfway there.
- What?
Mother's interrupted the course of our journey.
Why?
Yeah.
She's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise.
They have.
[ Ripley ]
Like what?
It seems she has... intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
She got us up to check it out.
A transmission?
Out here?
Yeah.
What kind of a transmission?
Acoustical beacon.
It repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.
S.O.S.?
I don't know.
Human?
Unknown.
[ Brett ]
Well, so what?
[ Kane ]
We are obligated under section eight-
I hate to bring this up, but, uh, this is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.
Right.
And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty.
And what about the money?
If you wanna give me some money,
I'll be happy to oblige.
The man's right.
Let's go over the bonus situation.
- I'm sorry. Can I say something?
- Let's talk about the bonus more.
There is a clause in the contract which specifically states... any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin... must be investigated.
I don't wanna hear it.
We don't know if it's intelligent.
I wanna go home and party.
Parker, will you just listen to the man?
On penalty of total forfeiture of shares.
No money.
You got that?
- [ Chuckling ]
Well, yeah.
- All right, we're going in.
Yeah.
We're goin' in, aren't we?
[ Clears Throat ]

What was the, uh, position?
[ Beeping ]
[ Clacking ]
[ Beeping ]
All right.
It found the quadrant.
Ascension: six minutes,
20 seconds.
Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds.
Okay. Put that on the screen for me.
[ Lambert ]
All right.
Well, that's it.
It's a planetoid.
1200 kilometers.
It's tiny.
Any rotation?
[ Beeping ]
[ Lambert ]
About two hours.
What about gravity?
Point eight-six.
You can walk on it.
[ Lambert Over Radio ]
Approaching orbital apogee.

- Is the hull breached?
- I don't see anything.
We've still got pressure.
- Hit the screen.
- Right.
[ Wind Howling ]
[ Parker Over Radio ]
Secondary load sharing unit... is out.
Three to four cells are gone.
Is that it?
No, hold on.
We can't fix it out here anyway, and we need to reroute... a couple of these ducts, wouldn't you say, Brett?
Dry dock time.
Dry dock.
Tell her we need to dry-dock.
Look, we couldn't fix it out here anyway.
We gotta reroute all these ducts, and in order to do that we've got to dry-dock.
[ Sighs ]
What else?
[ Parker Over Radio ]
Some fragments kicked up, and we've got to clean it all out and repressurize it.
[ Ripley Over Radio ]
How long before we're functional?
Look, what is- What-
It's 17 hours, tell her.
At least 25 hours.
Yeah.
[ Ripley ]
Get started on the floor panel.
I'll be right down.
What the hell's she comin' down here for?
She better stay the fuck out of my way,
I'll tell you that.
I'd like to see what she's gonna do when she gets here.
[ Wind Howling ]
Any response yet?
[ Ash ]
No. Absolutely nothing.
Except the same transmission every 12 seconds.
All the other channels are dead.
[ Clicks Switch ]
Kick on the floods.
We can't go anywhere in this.
Mmm.
Well, Mother says the sun's coming up in 20 minutes.
How far are we from the source of transmission?
Uh, northeast.
Just under 2,000 meters.
Walking distance?
[ Laughs ]
Well-
Can you give me an atmospheric?
Yes.
[ Ash ]
Oh.
It's almost primordial.
There's inert nitrogen, high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals, methane.
I'm working on the trace elements.
Anything else?
Yes.
It's... rock, lava base, and deep cold.
Well below the line.
Mm-hmm.
[ Kane ]
I'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out.
[ Dallas ]
Yeah, that figures.
You too, Lambert.
Swell.
[ Dallas ] Better break out the weapons.
[ Wind Howling ]

[ Voices Over Radio,

[ Ash ]
Good contact on my board.
[ Dallas Over Monitor ]
Clear and free.
Keep the line open. Let's go.
Hey, Ripley.
Hey, Ripley,
I wanna ask you a question.
If they find what they're lookin' for out there, does that mean we get full shares?
Don't worry, Parker.
You'll get whatever's coming to you.
Look, I'm not gonna do any more work... till we get this straightened out.
Brett, you're guaranteed by law to get a share.
[ Parker ] What?
- Why don't you just fuck off.
- What?
[ Brett ]
What'd you say, Rip?
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.
[ Parker ]
Hey, Ripley, come back here!
[ Chuckling ]
Son of a bitch.
What's the matter?
[ Lambert ]
Can't see a goddamn thing.
[ Kane ]
Quit griping.
I like griping.
[ Dallas ]
Come on. Knock it off.
[ Clacking ]
[ Respirators Hissing ]
Ash, can you see this?
Yes, I can.
I've never seen anything like it.
[ Dallas ]
Very bizarre.
[ Kane ]
You said it.
[ Dallas ]
All right.
Moving on to second... position.
[ Lambert ]
What is it?
Let's get out of here.
[ Kane ]
We've got this far.
We must go on.
We have to go on.
Will you say that again?
Shit.
[ Dallas ]
Ash, as you can see, it's kind of hard to describe.
I'm going back to the console.
[ Voices Continue Over Monitor,

You can on it.

[ Dallas Continues,

Dallas?
[ Respirators Hissing ]
Come on down here.
Something different down here.
I don't know what it is, but-
See if we can get up that wall.
If we can get up that wall, we can find out.
Amazing.
[ Dallas ]
Alien life-form.
Looks like it's been dead a long time.
Fossilized.
Looks like it's grown out of the chair.
Bones are bent outward, like he exploded from inside.
[ Lambert ]
Wonder what happened to the rest of the crew.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, Dallas, Lambert, come on over here.
Come on.
What do you got?
See what you make of this.
[ Clicks Switch ]
Ash.
That transmission-
Mother's deciphered part of it.
It doesn't look like an S.O.S.
What is it, then?
Well, I-
It looks like a warning.
I'm gonna go out after them.
What's the point?
I mean, by the time it takes to get there, you'll- they'll know if it's a warning or not, yes?
[ Clicks Switch ]
[ Exhales Deeply ]
[ Dallas ]
You okay down there?
Can you see anything?
Uh... a cave.
A ca- A cave of some sort.
But l-
Well, I don't know, but it's like the goddamn tropics in here.
What the hell is this?
The cave is completely enclosed, and it's full of... leathery objects, like eggs or something.
[ High-pitched Humming ]
There's a layer of mist...
[ High-pitched Tone ] just covering the eggs that reacts when broken.
[ Dallas Over Radio ]
Kane? You all right?
I'm okay.
All right.
I'm okay.
I just slipped.
Appears to be completely sealed.
[ Hisses ]

There's movement.
It seems to have life.

You there, Ripley?
I'm right here.
[ Beeping ]
Okay, Ripley, I'm at the inner lock hatch now.
Right.
Ripley.
We're clean. Let us in.
Right here.
- What happened to Kane?
- Something has attached itself to him.
- We have to get him to the infirmary right away.
- What kind of thing?
I need a clear definition.
An organism.
Open the hatch.
Wait a minute.
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure-
24 hours for decontamination.
He could die in 24 hours.
Open the hatch.
Listen to me.
If we break quarantine, we could all die.
Look, would you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside.
No. I can't do that.
And if you were in my position, you'd do the same.
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch right now.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Ripley, this is an order!
Do you hear me?
Yes, I read you.
The answer is negative.
Inner hatch opened.
[ Whirring ]
My God.
What the hell is that?
Jesus Christ.
What is that, man?
Hey, how the hell is he breathing?
Is he still alive or what?
Why don't you guys freeze him?
How come they don't freeze him?
What's going on in there?
What the fuck is going on?
You bitch!
Jesus Christ!
Hey! Hey!
You would've left us out there.
Break it up.
[ Dallas ]
Ripley, when I give an order,
I expect to be obeyed.
Even if it's against the law?
You're goddamn right!
Maybe she has a point.
Who the hell knows what that thing is.
How are we gonna get that off him?
How are we gonna get it off?
I'm gonna get some instruments.
My God.
Right.
I'll make an incision here.
Try and remove one of the digitals from-
You're gonna do what?
Finger. I'm gonna try and get his finger off.
Just a minute.
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
No, that's not- It's tearing his scalp.
I know!
It's not coming off without tearing his face off with it.
We'll have to take a look at him inside.
Right.
How come they don't freeze him?
[ Parker Shouting ]
How come you guys don't freeze him?
All right, you can take your mask off.
- What's it got down his throat?
- I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.
Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma, then keeps him alive.
Now what the hell is that?
We gotta get it off of him.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I mean, let's not be too hasty.
We don't know anything about... it.
Now, we're assuming it's feeding him oxygen.
If we remove it, it could kill him.
I'm willing to take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.
You'll take responsibility?
Yes, I'll take responsibility.
Get him out of there.
[ Dallas ]
Where do you wanna do this?
We'll make an incision just below the knuckle there.
Right here.
Stand by.
[ Whirring ]
[ Ash ]
Good God!
[ Dallas ]
That crap's gonna eat through the hull.
That thing's gonna eat through the goddamn hull.
Come on!
What's going on?
This way.
Next deck.
- [ Sizzling ]
- [ Parker ]
There it is.
Don't get under it!
Don't get under it.
Looks like it's stopping.
Take a look at this, man.
Yeah.
Brett, give me-
What do you got, a pen there?
Give it to me, quick.
Come on! Come on!
[ Brett ]
Don't get any on your arm.
It stopped.
Don't see anything like that except, uh, molecular acid.
It must be using it for blood.
It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.
You don't dare kill it.
What about Kane?
- Here's your pen back.
- [ Brett ]
What do we do now?
Leave Kane to Ash.
You get back to work.
Well, what-
[ Electrical Crackling ]
Okay.
Try it.
[ Motor Cranking ]
Damn it.
I thought sure that was it.
Try it again.
[ Cranking ]
I feel like I've been in this place a month.
We shouldn't have landed in this place in the first place.
Shouldn't have landed on this damn ball,
I know that.
Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and get out of here, the sooner we can go home.
This place gives me the creeps.
[ Ripley ]
That's amazing. What is it?
Ah, yes, it is.
Um-
I don't know yet.
[ Coughs ]
Did you want something?
Yes. I, uh-
I'd like to have a little talk.
How's, uh- How's Kane?
He's holding.
No changes.
And, uh, our guest?
Well-
Hmm?
Well, as I said,
I'm still... collating, actually, but, uh,
I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells... and replacing them with... polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance... to adverse environmental conditions.
Is that enough for you?
That's plenty.
What does it mean?
Please don't do that.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's an interesting combination of elements, making him a tough little son of a bitch.
And you let him in.
I was obeying a direct order, remember?
Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.
Oh, yes. I forgot.
You also forgot the science division's basic quarantine law.
No, that I didn't forget.
Oh, I see.
You just broke it.
Huh?
Look, what would you have done with Kane?
Hmm?
You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here.
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine, you risk everybody's life.
Maybe I should've left him outside.
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us, but it was a risk I was willing to take.
That's a pretty big risk... for a science officer.
It's, uh, not exactly out of the manual, is it?
I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you, you know.
You do your job... and let me do mine, yes?

I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas.
I just want you to listen-
Will you listen to-
[ Groans ]
Just tell me how you can leave that kind of decision to him.
Look, I just run the ship.
Anything that has to do with the science division,
Ash has the final word.
-How does that happen?
-It happens, my dear, because that's what the company wants to happen.
Since when is that standard procedure?
Standard procedure is to do what the hell they tell you to do.
What's happening with the repairs? How's it going?
They're pretty much finished now.
Why the hell didn't you tell me so?
- Because there's still some things left to do.
- Like what?
Well, we're blind on "B" and "C" decks.
The reserve power system's blown-
That's a bunch of horseshit.
We can take off without that.
Yeah, we can.
You think that's a good idea?
Look, I just wanna get the hell out of here, all right?

- He can always get to a doctor when we get back home.
- Right.

You know that?
Right.

- Just like a regular parrot.
- Yeah. Shape up.
- What are you, some kind of parrot?
- Right.

Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.
That's it.
Yes, and so will we.
Well, how about a little something to lower your spirits?

Just give me the short version.
How far to Earth?

[ Laughter ]
[ Lambert ]
How are you doing?
[ Coughs ]
Thank you.
How you doin'?
Um, terrific.
Next silly question.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, thank you.
Do you remember anything about the planet?
What's the last thing you do remember?
Huh?
[ Sighs ]
I remember some... horrible dream about... smothering.
And-
And- Anyway, where are we?
Right here.
We're on our way home.
Back to the old freezerinos.
Could I have something to eat before we go back?
I-I need something myself.
Yeah, right.
One more meal before bedtime.
I'm buyin'.
Hey, that's a break.
Bedtime.
[ Chattering ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
The first thing that I'm gonna do when I get back... is to get some decent food.
I can dig it, man.
Let me tell you, I've eaten worse food than this, but then I've tasted better, you know what I'm sayin'?
The other one over there.
Well, you pound down the stuff like there's no tomorrow.
I'd rather be eatin' something else, but, uh, right now I'm thinkin' food.
[ Kane ]
Well, you should know.
You know what it's made of.
No, man, I don't wanna talk about what it's made of.
I'm eatin' this just to-
[ Gagging ]
What's the matter?
The food ain't that bad, baby.
What's wrong, Kane?
[ Gagging, Retching ]
Are you choking?
What's wrong?
[ Coughing, Gasping ]
What? What?
- This is serious.
- Kane, what's the matter?
[ Gagging, Gasping ]
It's okay!
Hold him down!
Hold him-
[ Ash ]
Get the spoon in!
[ Groaning ]
Damn it!
Get it into his mouth!
I'm trying!
[ Screaming ]
[ Screams ]
[ Agonized Grunts ]
- [ Screeching ]
- [ Screaming ]
[ Lambert ]
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
No!
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
[ Screeching ]
[ Brett ]
Dallas?
Dallas?
Yeah.
Anything?
No. You?
Nothing.
You see anything?
No.
[ Loud Clank ]
[ Dallas ]
Inner hatch sealed.
Anybody wanna say anything?
This is just an ordinary prod, like a cattle prod.
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated all the way here, all the way up to here.
Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it.
It shouldn't damage the little bastard, unless its skin's thinner than ours.
But it will give him a little incentive.
Now we just have to find it.
I've taken care of that.
I've designed this tracking device.
You just set it to search for a moving object, like so.
Hasn't got much of a range, but when you get within a certain distance, it'll start to give off a signal.
What's it key on?
Micro changes in air density.
Give me a demo.
[ Whirring ]
See?
Again.
Got ya.
Two teams.
Ash, Lambert and l.
Ripley, you take
Parker and Brett.
Now, anyone see this thing, you catch it in the net... that Parker's holding on his lap.
Parker, I don't want any heroics out of you, all right?
Catch it, put it in the air lock, get rid of it.
Now, channels are open on all decks.
I want you to communicate, keep in touch at all times, all right?
Let's go.
I thought you fixed 12 module.
[ Brett ]
We did.
I don't understand it.
[ Parker ]
The circuits must have burned out.
What do we got here?
Damn it! Hold your light over here, would you?
Yeah, that's it.
I don't know if this is gonna work.
If I could just put this- put this in there.
Right.
Oh, damn it.
Check the insulation.
Oh, shit!
[ Tracking Device Whirring ]
Steady.
According to this, it's within five meters.
[ Indistinct Whispering ]
[ Ripley ]
Micro changes in air density, my ass.
[ Tracking Device Beeping ]
It's within five meters.
[ Parker ]
Be careful.
[ Beeping Continues ]
[ Ripley ] Christ.
[ Parker ] Don't do that.
Don't creep up on me with that thing.
[ Ripley ]
You guys, stick together.
[ Tracker Twittering ]
Don't fail me now.
[ Parker ]
What?
What is it?
Parker, Brett, it's in this locker!
Where?
[ Brett ]
Here, take this.
Get over there and get the net.
Get it?
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All right, Parker.
When I say.
All right. Now.
Easy.
[ Hissing ]
- [ All Chattering ]
- Wait! Don't let him go!
What the hell are you doing, man?
It's the cat.
[ Laughing ]
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it, man.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.
I'll- I'll- I'll-
Go and get it, man.
All right.
You get him.
We'll go on.
[ Sighs ]
[ Scoffs ]
Here, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Enough of that kitty crap.
Jones.
Jonesy?
Here, Jonesy.
[ Meowing ]
[ Cat Mewing ]
Jonesy?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
[ Meowing ]
Here, Jonesy.
Jonesy?
[ Faint Meowing ]
Here, kitty, kitty.
[ Meowing ]
[ Footsteps Echoing ]
[ Liquid Splashing ]
[ Chains Clinking ]
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, Jonesy.
Jonesy.
Kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Jonesy?
Hey. Hey.
Come on, Jonesy.
Come on, baby.
That's a kitty.
That's a kitty.
Come on, baby.
- That's a kitty.
- [ Hisses ]
Hey, hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on.
[ Snarling ]
[ Screaming ]
Brett!
[ Parker ]
Brett!
Brett!
Whatever it was, it was- it was big and-
You're sure it took him into the air shaft?
Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts.
No question, it's- it's using the air ducts to move around.
Could he want
Brett alive?
What?
Could Brett be alive?
No. I mean,
I don't think so.
Well, this air shaft may work to our advantage.
Here it leads up to and comes out in the main air lock.
All right. There's only one big opening along the way.
We can cover that up, and then we... drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space.
This son of a bitch is huge!
- I mean, it's like a man. It's big!
- Kane's son.
Come on, Ash.
Science department should be able to help us.
What can we do to drive it?
Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere, considering its nutritional requirements.
- The only thing we don't know about is temperature.
- Okay. What about temperature?
- What happens if we change it?
- Let's try it.
I mean, most animals retreat from fire. Yes?
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig... three or four incinerator units?
Give me about 20 minutes.
I'll do it.
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.
No.
You and Ash... take the main air lock.
Parker, Lambert, you cover up that maintenance opening, please.
[ Lambert ]
Right.
[ Beeping ]
- [ Dallas ]
I'm at the first junction.
- Dallas, I'm right here.
- Parker?
- Yeah?
- Lambert?
We're in position.
I'm just trying to get a reading here.
- The air lock is open.
- Okay, Ripley.
Ready.
All right. I've got a reading on you now.
[ Tracker Beeping ]
Uh, open the hatch to the third junction.
[ Beeping ]
[ Beeping Continues ]
[ Dallas ]
Okay, I'm through.
Ripley?
Yes.
Close all the hatches behind me.
I'm moving on.
[ Lambert ]
Dallas, hold it a minute.
I think I got it.
Yes, I've got it.
[ Dallas ]
Where?
[ Lambert ] It's somewhere around the third junction.
Okay, moving on.
It is right around there.
Now, Dallas, you're gonna have to be careful.
All right.
I've reached... the third junction, and I'm going down.
[ Sensors Beeping ]
[ Beeping ]
The hell's the matter with that box?
Dallas, you're gonna have to hold your position for a minute. I-
I've lost the signal.
What? You sure?
Look around. Are you sure it's not there? It's got to be around there somewhere.
[ Dallas ] Checked it out,
Lambert. You may be getting interserence.
[ Lambert ] Dallas, are you sure there's no sign of it?
I mean, it is there.
It's gotta be around there.
- Dallas?
- God, what is happening?
All right.
Uh, am I- am I clear, Lambert?
I want to get the hell out of here.
[ Beeping ]
[ Lambert ]
Oh, God. It's moving right towards you.
Um-
Move! Get out of there!
Behind you! Move!
Dallas! Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas!
Get out!
[ Sobbing ]
Move!
The other way!
[ Screeching ]
[ Shrill Feedback ]
Dallas?
Oh, no.
Take it easy.
[ Parker ]
Dallas?
We found this laying there.
No blood.
No Dallas.
Nothing.
How come I don't hear nobody saying nothing?
I'm thinking.
Unless somebody has got a better idea, we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.
What? And end up like the others?
Ohh. No, you're out of your mind.
- Got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon this ship.
We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here.
We take our chances and just hope that... somebody picks us up.
Lambert.
The shuttle won't take four.
Then why don't we draw straws and-
I'm not drawin' any straws.
I'm for killing that goddamn thing right now.
[ Ripley ]
Okay.
Well, let's talk about killing it.
[ Parker Grumbling ]
We know it's using the air shafts- Will you listen to me, Parker?
Shut up!
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
It's using the air shafts.
We don't know that.
That's the only way.
We'll move in pairs.
We'll go step by step... and cut off every bulkhead and every vent... until we have it cornered, and then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.
Is that acceptable to you?
If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me.
Obviously it means killing it.
But we have to stick together.
How are our weapons?
The weapons are fine.
This one needs refueling.
Will you get it, please?
Ash, go with him.
No, no. I can manage, Ash.
Don't follow me.
Ash?
Any suggestions from you or Mother?
No, we're still collating.
[ Laughs ]
You're what?
You're still collating?
I find that hard to believe.
What would you like me to do?
Just what you've been doing, Ash.
Nothing.
I've got access to Mother now, and I'll get my own answers, thank you.
All right.
[ Clicking, Beeping ]
[ Whirring ]
[ Keyboard Beeping ]
There is an explanation for this, you know.
Is there really?
I don't wanna hear your goddamn explanation!
[ Sobbing ]
I want- I want-
[ Sobbing ]
I want- I w-
Parker. Lambert?
Ash, open the door.
Ash-
Will you open the door?
Let me by, Ash.
[ Giggling ]

Get her up. Get her up.
Get her up. Get her up.
[ Chittering ]
Android!
He's an android!
[ Screeching ]
Jesus!
[ Parker ]
It's a robot.
Ash is a goddamn robot!
God!
[ Parker ]
Oh! Get off me- Oh!
Holy shit!
Help! Help me get this fucking thing off!
[ Screaming ]
Aah!
God! Jesus!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
[ Parker ]
How come the company sent us a goddamn robot?
[ Ripley ] All I can think of is they must've wanted the alien for their weapons division.
He's been protecting it right along.
Parker, will you plug it in?
[ Parker ] I don't know why-
Because he may know how to kill it.
[ Ripley ]
Ash, can you hear me?
Ash?
[ Distorted Voice ]
Yes, I can hear you.
- What was your special order?
- You read it.
I thought it was clear.
- What was it?
- Bring back life-form.
Priority one. All other priorities rescinded.
The damn company!
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?
I repeat: All other priorities are rescinded.
[ Ripley ]
How do we kill it, Ash?
There's got to be a way of killing it.
How- How do we do it?
You can't.
-That's bullshit!
-You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you?
A persect organism.
Its structural persection is matched only by its hostility.
You admire it.
I admire its purity.
A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.
[ Parker ]
Look, I- I've heard enough of this, and I'm asking you to pull the plug.
[ Ash ]
Last word.
What?
I can't lie to you about your chances, but... you have my sympathies.
We're gonna blow up the ship.
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.
Blow up the ship.
Good.
Come on.
When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows?
Ten minutes.
No bullshit.
If we ain't outta here in ten minutes, we won't need no rocket to fly through space.
We're gonna need coolant for the air support system.
You two go down, get all the coolant you can carry.
I'll get the shuttle ready.
I'll give you about- about seven minutes.
Come back up here.
I'll shut the switches off, and we'll blow this fucker off into space.
Okay. All right.
Come on.
Ready?
Take care of yourself.
Seven minutes.

Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo.
Third officer reporting.
The other members of the crew-
Kane, Lambert,
Parker, Brett,
Ash and Captain Dallas- are dead.
Cargo and ship destroyed.
I should reach the frontier in about six weeks.
With a little luck, the network will pick me up.
This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.
Come on, cat.

Good evening Mr. and Mrs.
North and south America, and all our ships at sea, let's get a fresh flesh... -Flash!
Congress today has called an emergency session, but as yet no one has shown up.
And the president refuses to issue a statement, having locked himself and the vice president in his bath-room early this morning.
However, the first lady urges all, and I quote,
"seek comfort in the Bible," unquote.
A bulletin just in, the world's top scientists are holding a conference in Washington, D.C., awaiting a statement from professor Gordon, world authority on animal behavior and renowned physicist.
Gentlemen, we are in big trouble.
Sex madness perils planet!
Extra! Read all about it!
Sex madness perils planet!
Get it now, read all about it!
Sex madness perils planet!
Hey, scram you horny jerks!
Gentlemen!
As I have told you, we are in big trouble.
I think there is no need for me to describe to you the incredible chaos our beloved planet has been plunged into.
Of the disgrace-ful acts which are being committed at this very moment!
In every apartment, on every street corner, or on the rooftops!
In grass huts in the jungle, in igloos in the arctic.
In airports, in markets, in movie houses, in the parks!
Yes, we are in big trouble.
Doctor Gordon...
All of us here are aware of the total degradation that has overcome the masses, but what are we going to do about it?
What is causing it?
Now I say it's a virus and we must find a vaccine for it!
It is not a virus, any fool can see it's a case of mass hypnosis!
Hypnosis... ha!
I've done research and traced the cause to cans of bad passover tuna.
Tuna fish, tuna fish!
This guy's got
Mercury on his brain!
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, we must be calm!
Future generations are depending on decisions made here today.
Now, I have discovered three things about this madness.
Number one, not all areas are affected.
Look around you, are anyone of you sexually aroused?
Yes, ha-ha-hal anyone of you, huh? No!
Not all areas have been affected.
Number two, my son, who has been rep-resenting
United States at the tenth international ice hockey playoffs in Tibet, has discovered what appears to be a great beam of light proceeding from some far off planet whose appearance is simultaneous with the first occurrence yesterday.
Number three,
I discovered my wife...
In bed with the garbage man.
But what about your son, professor?
Did he find anything else out?
Yes professor, what are you holding back from us?
What's the scoop?
My son is at this very moment,
'on his way back to this country and as soon as he has landed...
We shall all find out.
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Mable towers, mable towers, we're experiencing foul weather.
Sorry!
Oh, oooh, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
Is this your first flight?
My first drink.
It's a terrible storm, do you think we're going to make it?
Don't worry.
These new fordent trimotors are the safest things in the sky.
My name is Dale ardor, what's yours?
Flesh. Flesh Gordon.
Oh, professor Gordon's son?
Why yes.
Sir, look out!
Control yourself, Dale!
Control yourself, Dale! Dale!
Con-control yourself, Dale!
Sir, I've got a giant boner!
Well slap the damn thing down.
I can't!
I've got to keep this thing under control.
I can't!
Mable towers, mable towers.
You got two horny son-of-a-bitches here.
We're signing off.
Dale! There's no one at the controls!
The plane's going down!
Go down, go down!
Oh yes, oh yes. Oh, flesh.
Flesh! Flesh!
Oh, flesh!
Flesh!
Let me go!
Flesh!
Flesh... oh!
Jd
Dale. We'll have to bail out.
Flesh, oh my god, ooh.
Oh my god!
Just hold on!
I can't hold anymore!
Ooohhh. Oh!
Jd
Flesh, mmm.
Dale?
Dale, darling, are you all right?
You called me "darling."
Oh, flesh, what's happening?
- Can you walk?
- I think so.
Here, put this on.
Jd
Flesh, what's that?
Come on, maybe we can get to a telephone there.
Stop.
Not another step further.
I know what you've come here for.
But you're not going to get it.
Look, I don't know who you think we are, but this girl's hurt, and we gotta get to a telephone.
You see, we were flying along in this airplane from Tibet, when suddenly we were hit by this sex ray from outer space.
And this unrestrained sex orgy ensued, which both of the pilots joined in.
When I noticed the plane was going down,
I took over the controls but they broke off in my hand.
So you see the young lady, nearly overcome with sex madness, and myself, bailed out just before the plane crashed.
And we landed just over there.
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think I don't know you've come here to steal the secret plans to my new interstellar, hydrocombustion, miracle patented, micro-teflon, nuclear, gamastaddle rocketship-plane-missle!
Which was twenty years in the making.
And employs a new updraft design, which lifts the ship on small spirals of synthetic strontium pellets.
Do you think I don't know that!
Well, I've never even heard of it.
So you're barking up the wrong tree.
Come here, young lady.
I would like to conduct a little experiment, you see there's evidence that exposure to the sex ray, increases the size of the secondary...
- Jerkoff!
- What?
Flexi jerkoff, I thought
I recognized you.
Why... why you must be flesh, professor Gordon's son.
I was wondering why you knew so much about the sex ray.
Come, let me show you the ship.
Gosh, let me introduce you.
Dale ardor, this is doctor flexi jerkoff.
How do you do?
So you see, I've actually discovered which planet the sex ray is coming from, and fortunately, the straddle ship was ready just in time.
Oh, you can't know what it was like, out here, all alone when the sex ray hit.
It was hell!
Fortunately, the rocket was completed before that happened, and the design was not influenced.
You look so funny.
Jd
Oh, the likeness is incredible.
I was able to get most of the parts from the sears catalogue.
And you really think it will make it to the outer reaches of the solar system?
It's got to.
It's the last hope humanity has.
Flesh... Dale...
Will you come with me?
It will be a dangerous trip, and I don't know what we're likely to encounter out there, but someone has got to save the earth from the treacherous clutches of that evil ray.
What do you think, Dale?
Flesh, let's do it.
Sure, why not, we'll give it a try.
Wonderful!
The planet's orbit will bring it closest to the earth in approximately...
Six minutes!
And there's much work to be done.
Come, follow me.
Jd
Where do you want these, doc?
Right over there flesh, storage bin c.
Jd
What's this gizmo do, doc?
Don't touch that dial!
I had an assistant once who touched that dial.
Touch that dial.
Gee doc, you really got a lot of neat stuff.
Did it take you a long time to put it all together?
Don't bother me now, flesh, it's almost ready.
Get the door.
Which button, doc?
That one.
Ignition.
- Ready, Dale?
- Ready, flesh.
All right, hang on.
We're taking off.
Fire rocket one.
Jd
Fire rocket two.
Jd
Jd
Hang on now, we're going through the moronosphere.
Jd
Jd
Jd
Look, Dale!
The moon!
The earth!
Oh, it's beautiful.
Jd
Wow! I can see the Great Lakes!
There's lake Ontario, lake Michigan, lake superior...
What is it, Dale?
The sex ray, we're heading right for it, change course quick!
It's... it's jammed, flesh,
I can't move it!
Let me try!
Jd
Another episode like that, and I'll be ready for the old folk's home.
Jd
Hey doc, what sort of planet does it look like to you?
Definitely inhabited, flesh.
No natural force could have affected us the way that sex ray did.
And look at those green areas over there...
It's probably forest or jungle, I should think.
And those are desert areas over there.
This planet even has frigid polar regions, not unlike those of earth.
Let's have a closer look, shall we.
Jd
Hang on, we're going down.
Jd
Forgive me, your protuberance, but at this moment an alien ship approaches porno.
Probably the earth people.
Bring the ship down, but I want the earthlings brought to me unharmed.
Understand?
Yes, your protuberance.
Jd
Not too close, look!
Do you suppose they're friendly?
Jd
The starboard gammamodulator's been hit!
- I'll fix it.
- Oh no!
I can't control the ship, flesh!
- Hold on, jerkoff!
- Do something, flesh!
I think we're going to crash.
Oh! Oh, no, what's going to happen?
Hurry, flesh!
I'm hurrying, jerkoff,
I'm hurrying!
Save us!
Oooooohhhhhh.
I'm trying to!
Hurry flesh!
We're in deep trouble flesh.
Ah, come on, jerkoff!
Oh, flesh, do something!
- Hurry!
- Dale, quick!
Give me a Bobby pin! Come here!
Here's one!
Oh...
Save us.
Jerkoff, I think I've fixed it!
- Oh, god!
- You're right.
She's beginning to respond to the controls.
All right now, hang on.
Hold on Dale.
The ship's falling apart!
- Hold on, Dale!
- I'm holding on.
I'm taking her down.
Jd
Jd
Dr. jerkoff, Dr. jerkoff!
Are you all right?
Oh, flesh. I think so.
Is the ship badly damaged, flesh?
I don't know, let's go outside and have a look.
Yes.
Oh, Dale.
Just a moment, I think
I have something here.
For, uh... yes.
It was my mother's.
She was buried in it.
Good, there's oxygen on this planet.
This is the strangest place I've ever seen.
I wonder why they didn't send the welcoming committee?
They did, look!
Quick, into that cave!
Jd
Sist and decease!
Jd
Quick, in here!
Jd
Hep, hep, hep.
Hep, hep, hep.
Left, left, left.
You men search over there.
Left, left, left...
They'll be coming back.
Let's go this way, maybe there's another way out.
Jd
It's so strange in here.
Flesh, it almost looks alive.
What is it, flesh?
I'm not quite sure.
Jd
And what unusual formations and textures.
Why, this is like no rock known to science.
It's.
It's not hard like a rock, it's...
Whoaaaaaaaaal great galaxies!
What is it doc?
Some species of penisaurus,
I should think.
This way!
Jd
Jerkoff! She'd down!
What... oh, oh!
Better get this, jerkoff.
Oh, you beast, get away from me!
You stink!
All right, flesh.
Stand aside.
Oh, no!
Jd
Left, left, left...
Ah, ha.
Oh!
Flesh!
What was that?
The earth people.
It came from down there.
After them. - Run.
Nol there they are.
What?
Take the earthlings alive.
Tie them up.
- I got dibs on the girl.
- The blonde giant's mine.
Leave the bearded one for me.
Jd
Jd
Your sickness, we have captured the earth people, and await your command.
The earth people, eh?
Bring them to me at once.
Fetch the earth people here!
His sickness will seeeee theeemmmm!
Stop shouting, you dildo.
Jd
Why have you come to the planet porno?
To destroy the terrible sex ray that has brought chaos to our beloved planet earth.
I should think you'd be thanking me.
But no matter.
No power in the universe can ever hope to squelch the infinite force of my sex beam.
But why must you do this thing?
The earth is a peaceful planet and poses no threat to you!
I'll tell you later.
But, how did you get here?
The straddle ship I constructed.
A scientist, eh?
I could use a brain like yours.
Guards!
Take him to the laboratory and show him what to do.
No, no, no!
Jd
Bring the earth woman closer.
No! No!
By the goddess yumi, you are beautiful!
My eyes have never beheld such loveliness.
You shall be my bride!
Nol ohhhh, she is exquisite, she is exquisite.
Take your filthy, vellow hands off her!
Don't touch her, I'll kill you!
Silence! Get him off me!
Take him!
Take him to the sex depletor and bring me his essence!
It should add immeasurably to the pleasure of our wedding night.
Stop.
The blonde giant shall not be depleted.
Amora. As queen of darkness, and guardian of the sacred power pasties, you have the privilege to spare him only if he survives the torture I ordain.
I sentence him to trial by ordeal.
So be it, then, wang.
But if he survives, he's mine!
To the arena with him!
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
To the depletor with him!
He's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine!
After them, you ninnies!
Jd
Sleep now, and forget.
Forget all.
We shall love, and my body...
Will be linked forever with yours.
When you awake, you shall be my king of darkness.
Jd
Jd
Oh, Gordon...
Jd
Your protuberance, we have spotted queen amora's ship over the forest kingdom.
Shoot them down, and bring them to me!
But your assholiness, the forest people and we are sworn enemies.
We could not survive a landing in this realm.
Are you afraid of a few vegetables?
I gave you my orders!
I will be obeyed!
Yes, degenerate one.
Make ready for the ceremony!
Porno shall have a new queen tonight.
Out of my way, dildo!
Guard, I need your help.
Here, hold that.
This, hold that too...
And this also, please...
And just one more thing, that's it.
Very good.
Put up your hands!
Jd
Down, please.
Jd
Give me the keys.
Jd
Jd
Oh, come in me!
Damn, you magnificent giant.
Come, come, come!
And bind us forever in darkness.
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
- W...
- A
- n...
- G.
Emperor wang is the one for me, without him, the planet porno, would be ever so forlorno.
Francis newberry.
Jd
Jd
Jerkoff!
Flesh! I thought you were amora.
This is all I could find to wear.
How'd you get away from wang's palace?
When I discovered wang's plan to destroy amora's ship,
I overpowered the guard with a radium gas
I developed in wang's laboratory.
And, disguising myself as a pirate, followed the bomber ship and swooped down to rescue you.
What about Dale?
Even at this very moment, the ceremony which will render
Dale and wang man and wife draws ever nearer its fateful conclusion.
It's no use, flesh.
Alone, we would be powerless to stop it.
Flesh, look!
I had led an evil life.
And my thoughts have arisen from the seeds of darkness and greed.
Take these stones.
These are the source of my power.
And with them, destroy wang and his insidious schemes.
These, my power pasties, are the only force that can stop the sex beam.
Once accomplished, earthlings, my spirit shall at last rest in peace.
She was a noble woman, flesh.
Took a lot of guts.
She was a brave scout.
Come on, doc, we haven't got much time to lose.
Wait a minute doc,
I can't go like this,
I feel silly.
Don't worry, flesh.
I think I've got something for you in the ship.
Come on, jerkoff, we've got to stop wang!
- All right, flesh.
- Come on!
Oh please.
Left, left, left, left...
Jd
I eft...
There they are!
Jd
You may...
Kisssss the bride.
Ahhh, ha-ha...
Come here, my little bottle cap.
Get away from me you slimy snail!
Oh!
Jd
That's all for this rancid affair, you Turkey!
Stop!
The wedding's over, wang!
After them, you dildos!
Jd
Amateurs!
The pasties, jerkoff!
Jd
All right, wang, where is she?
What have you done with Dale?
So help me if you lay a hand on her I'll...
You're too late, you fool!
She was spirited away barely a breath before love's first kiss.
I have been robbed of my beautiful virgin bride.
Shall I give it to him now, flesh?
Not now doc, he's been through enough.
If you find her, tell her I love her!
Stop fighting me foolish woman, I'm trying to save you!
Halt!
I have brought the earth girl.
Follow me.
Jd
No, no, where are you taking me!
No, no, take me back to flesh.
I no!
Nol
Jd
The earth girl.
We've been hoping you'd drop in, ever since we heard of your opposition to emperor wang.
But, perhaps I should explain.
Am chief Nellie.
Commander of the vast and powerful
Amazon underground of porno.
An organization solely devoted to the over-throw of wang and his corrupt male chauvinist regime.
But what does that have to do with me?
Our spies have been watching you closely, because of your determined and flagrant dislike of wang and his cohorts...
We, uh, have decided to initiate you into our ranks.
But I want the earthman, flesh Gordon.
You will be of more use here with us.
No! No...
Jd
Wait, what are you doing?
I've gotta get back to flesh!
Jd
Jd
Ranks in formation, for selection inspection.
Mmm, very nice face, very pretty.
Nice nipple.
Ohhhh, yes, mmm-mmmbh...
Pretty hair, nice, shiny...
What are you doing to your nipples, zerig?
They look very nice. Very nice.
Face is nice...
Turn around, let's see.
Bend over, let's see.
Oh, yeah, real nice.
Very nice. Nice bottom.
Mmmm, no! No good.
Step forward.
Oh excellent, excellent, prepare yourself, you'll do.
No, no! Oh!
Jd
Flesh! Flesh!
No! Get away!
Flesh! No! No!
Get away! Get away!
Flesh!
Flesh! Flesh!
Flesh! Nol jerkoff.
I heard Dale... she's in some sort of trouble.
Jerkoff, I hear Dale...
She's in some sort of trouble.
Dale!
Get away! Get away!
We're in some sort of pit, doc.
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Here let me try.
Try to get us outta here.
Didn't work.
Stand back, flesh.
Jd
Come on, doc.
There she is, doc.
Good lord, flesh, they're dykes!
Dykes!
Don't any of you try anything now.
I've got the power pasties and
I know how to use 'em.
You, get back there with the others.
I know your kind.
Now what were you doing down here?
What were you doing with Dale?
Get back there!
Jerkoff!
Jd
Jd
No, no! You might hit flesh.
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
Jd
What happened to it, flesh?
An arrow.
A poison tipped arrow, in fact.
Whoever you are, we owe you our lives.
Nonsense.
I was happy to do it, for you see...
I'm prince precious, rightful heir to the throne of porno.
Years ago this planet was a veritable paradise, but wang, a maniacal botanist, whose organ was devoured by a crazed penis flytrap, could not tolerate the existence of so much pleasure.
And so, banding together an army of the impotent and frustrated, and armed with a small, but effective, sex ray, plunged my palace into carnal chaos, and took it over, exiling me, and my few advisors, to what is now known as the forest kingdom.
Then you feel that, together, we might put an end to wang's savage reign.
And that our new cosmic friendship might inspire an everlasting bond of kindness and love between the peoples of this planet and yours.
If there's anything
I can ever do to repay you.
Jd
Jd
Stay a while, flesh, the fun's just beginning.
I'd like to, precious, but I can't.
I'd better get back to the lab with doctor jerkoff and help him work on the destructo beam.
Come, I'll go with you.
Jd
Oh, flesh, I was just going to send for you.
What happened, doc?
Any scientist could tell you, flesh.
Now, the beam is finished and ready to be tested.
Now, if my calculations are correct, one blast from my device and wang's odious sex ray will be utterly smashed to smithereens.
Well, how does it work, doc?
I'll show you.
First, we have to attach the power pasties.
Let me help you.
Jd
Now, over there is a scale model of wang's sex ray, surrounded by an electromagnesium force field so impervious, that were it not for the energy of queen amora's power pasties, we could never hope to destroy it.
Now, stand back.
Watch this.
- Wow!
- Fantastic, doctor.
That's incredible.
Congratulations. Congratulation.
It works, jerkoff.
It's the eighth wonder of the world.
I knew it would.
Then all we have to do is mount it in a ship.
And blow wang's evil ray to atoms.
Then we can go home, can't we, flesh?
With good luck, and good weather, Dale, we'll be home tomorrow night.
Oh, flesh.
- Let me prepare the ship.
- Yes, yes.
To the ship!
Jd
Your aloneness, the earthmen have invented a gun, with which they plan to destroy our sex ray.
Ah!
I have had enough of these meddlers!
They have interfered with the affairs of my regime for the very last time, and they will be stopped.
Now, listen carefully.
Jd
Doc, we're getting close to wang's palace.
Just one more minute, flesh, I'm almost ready.
Careful!
This device has a delicate electromagnetic balance.
Any disturbance can blow us all to atoms!
There it is, jerkoff, the sex ray.
It's the forest flyer, sound the alarm!
They've spotted us, jerkoff, get ready.
Now!
Stop him!
He...
Get him. My pasties!
Jd
Pull the ship up, quick!
Jd
- It's stuck!
- Let me give it a try.
Jd
Flesh, we're doomed!
Jd
Jd
We've stopped falling, what's happened?
We've fallen into some sort of magnetic beam.
It's drawing us safely down.
But why would wang want to save us?
He doesn't! Look!
Jd
Jd
Jd
When last seen, our hapless heroes were about to be crunched into oblivion by the perverted wang's chomping jaws.
Is there no justice on porno?
Jd
Dale, this is yours.
Jd
Dr. jerkoff.
Here's one for you, flesh.
Jd
Dale, are you all right?
I'm all right, flesh.
It's really a shame about that other guy, stealing your pasties like that, and he was my best boy.
What ever happened to the other fellow?
We only had four parachutes.
Oh.
Jd
Come on, we've got to get to wang.
Jd
Come on, flesh, let's go!
Hurry up!
Jd
Jd
There he goes, after him.
Jd
Jd
Your struggles are useless!
You are trapped and you shall not live!
I have tolerated your feeble attempts to thwart me for the very last time!
We have ways of dealing with you, yankee.
See how you like my royal flush, earthling!
- What is it?
- The floor!
Oh, no.
Jd
- There used to be one.
- That's it, earthlings.
Goodbye, Gordon. Sweet dreams.
Oh.
Here it comes.
Jd
Bye, bye!
- Nice knowing you, flesh.
- Yes, it was, thank you.
Jd
J flesh Gordon is dead hey j j flesh Gordon is dead hey j j flesh is dead j j Gordon is dead j j flesh Gordon is dead j j baby flesh Gordon is dead j jd

J flesh Gordon is dead j j flesh Gordon is dead j your lowness.
Oh-oh, great impotentate,
I have done as you commanded, and I brought you the power jewels.
Though the earthmen cannot now destroy the sex beam, they're alive and loose in the palace...
Never mind that,
I have dealt with them already!
Give me the Jewel.
Did the nasty spy frighten my babies?
Never mind that, little wangy-pangy is going to take care of you all.
Wangy favors you with a trinket, my little peanut-butter cup.
Hmm.
Mmm.
What do you mean it's stuck?
- It's stuck!
- Stuck?
What do you mean, stuck?
Stop!
. Flesh Gordon!
The Jewel, wang!
The Jewel, where is it?
Gimme that Jewel, or so help me I'll finish you right here and now!
Let me have him, flesh.
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.
The Jewel, wang, where is it?
You guess!
Jd
- Am I gettin' warm?
- Oh, very warm.
- Is it this, flesh?
- No, that's not it.
Jd
Give me that Jewel.
Give me that Jewel this minute, do ya hear?
Ah, I can't, it's stuck.
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Gimme that Jewel!
I can't!
Idiot, you thought you could defy me, but you have yet to tangle with my rapist robots.
Jd
It's stuck!
Jd
Oh, I wish I had a picture of this.
Give me that Jewel this minute, do ya hear?
Flesh!
Jd
What-a-way to go, eh, earthman?
In a flash of mechanical ecstasy.
Flesh! Flesh!
Flesh! Flesh!
Flesh!
No! Nol jd
Fools!
Idiots!
What do you think you're doing?
What-a-way to go, hey, wang?
You have not heard the last of wang.
Jd
Flesh, come on, we can't let wang get away.
Never mind wang now, we have to get the Jewel and save the earth.
That reminds me...
Oh, I can't, I can't!
Spit it out!
It's stuck!
Jd
A plague, a pox, a pestilence of storm!
Anything, anything, oh, great one!
The fate of all evil rests in your hands!
Arise, arise, and destroy your enemies, and avenge the glorious cause of perversion!
Jd
Ooh, boy.
I just love murder.
Out of my way, you little fart.
Jd
A monster's work is never done.
Oh.
Oh, yeah. Mmm-mmm_
Jd
Oh, fuck.
Stop, look...
Listen.
Too late now, my imbecilic siblings!
The sex ray is too good for your earth!
I'm going to burn your fucking planet to a fucking crisp!
Jd
Watch your back!
Well...
Mmm.
How delightful.
He's got Dale!
Quick jerkoff, use the destructo beam to kill him!
I dare not, at this distance there's too great a risk of hitting Dale.
If only we could get closer.
Wait a minute, we'll use wang's rocket ship.
Come on.
Jd
Ah, you and I are going to be good friends.
Coochie.
Jd
And...
Wow.
Well, this is the tower of murder, and it's where I hang out.
Oh, oh, no.
Are you having a good time?
Jd
Come on, jerkoff.
Ooh, flesh!
Flesh, save me.
God, it's high.
Jd
Hmm.
Yes, you're incredible.
I wonder how you'd look in black...
Nylons.
What do you think of that, hmm?
Hmm? Huh?
Oh...
Hmm-hmm.
Hmm-hmm.
Jd
I just want to look at your tits.
There she is, doc.
Jd
Hey, they're getting serious.
Okay, doc, get ready.
Ready, flesh.
Fire!
Doc, you missed!
I know I missed. I'll get him.
Well, I never.
Jd
Up yours, Gordon.
Oh, wow, uhf, pain.
And now, you get...
Yours.
Get away.
My ass.
My ass.
Pain, humiliation. Hemorrhoids.
Jd
- Dale, are you all right?
- Oh, flesh.
Gordon.
Let's do it fast, flesh!
For this you'll pay.
No one burns my ass and lives to get laid.
Oh, shit!
Jd
Jd
- Goodbye, jerkoff.
- Goodbye, prince.
And Dale.
- Goodbye flesh.
- Precious.
We'll miss you around here.
Don't worry, precious,
I'll be back, and next time it'll be a friendly visit.
With wang out of the way and his terrible regime dispersed, the universe is once again safe for democracy and freedom, and the right of all due happiness, each according to his own personal religious convictions.
Jd
Goodbye, flesh.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Have a safe journey.
- It's been grand.
- Yes.
We'll see you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, precious.
Be sure and write us.
Take care precious.
- Okay, see ya.
- Be good.
- Bye now.
- So long.
Adios.
Jd
Jd
There she is, the earth.
Jd
Oh, flesh, there's no place like home.
Jd
Are we the first?
Are we the first to arrive here?
Is the interpreter with you?
I'm not a professional interpreter.
My occupation is cartography.
I'm a mapmaker.
Can you translate French into English and English into French?
Yes, I explained to the team leader in Villa Hermosa.
I'm just a little taken by surprise.
They're all there! All of them!
Check for landing marks!
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers off the engine blocks!
M-447148!
W-445529!
Number 445529, check!
Approximately 46 gallons in the right tank!
447149, check!
Tell me something.
What's happening here?
- It's flight number 19!
- 19 what?
It's that training mission from the naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.
They were doing target runs on an old hulk.
Who flies crates like these anymore?
No one! These planes were reported missing in 1945.
But it looks brand-new!
Where's the pilot?
I don't understand!
Where's the crew? Hey!
How the hell did it get here?!
He says this guy's local.
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.
Sunburn?
He says the sun came out last night.
He says it sang to him.
Harry, keep an eye on that point-out.
He's on 122.5.
I'll be right back.
Indianapolis Center, you have any traffic for Air East 31?
Air East 31, negative.
The only traffic I have is a TWA L-1011 in your 6 o'clock position...
...range 15 miles...
...and an Allegheny DC-9 in your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.
Stand by. I'll take a look at broadband, over.
Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock, slightly above and descending.
Air East 31, roger.
I have a primary target about that position now.
I have no known traffic.
Stand by, I'll check low, over.
Check and see if they know who it is.
Center, Air East 31.
The traffic's not lower than us.
He's 1 o'clock now, still above me and descending.
Air East 31, can you say aircraft type?
Negative, Center, no distinct outline.
To tell you the truth, the target is rather brilliant.
It has the brightest anti-collision lights I think I've ever seen.
Alternating white to red.
The colours are striking.
Center, this is TWA 517.
Traffic now looks lik e extra-bright landing lights.
I thought Air East had his landing lights on.
It could be a satellite.
I have a primary target now in your 10 o'clock position...
...five miles, over.
- Never seen anything like that.
- Affirmative, 31.
The traffic is proceeding northeast.
No altitude readout.
Roger, Center. It doesn't appear he'll be a problem.
He's going to descend about 1500 feet below me.
Wait a second!
Stand by one.
Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.
He's heading for my windshield.
We're turning immediately.
Air East 31, descend and maintain flight level 310.
Break Allegheny, turn right 30 degrees.
Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing and see what they're testing up there.
Do you have test operations in restricted area 2508?
Air East 31, roger.
The traffic is luminous and exhibiting non-ballistic motion.
Roger. Continue descent at your discretion.
Okay, Center. Descent at pilot's discretion is approved.
The traffic is approaching head-on, ultra-bright and really moving.
And right by us! Right now!
Now, that was really close.
Air East 31 is out of 340...
Ask if they want to report officially.
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.
Negative. We don't want to report.
Air East 31, do you wish to report a UFO? Over.
Negative. We don't want to report one either.
Air East 31, do you wish to file a report of any kind? Over.
I wouldn't know what kind of report to file, Center.
Air East 31, me neither.
I'll try to track traffic to destination, over.
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...
What?
Barry?
Honey?
Honey?
Barry!
Barry.
Barry!
Dad, do my problems for me.
I don't have to do your problems for you. You do your problems for you.
That's why I graduated, so I don't have to do problems.
I don't understand these fractions.
All right. What's one-third of 60?
That's a fraction.
I don't understand them.
All right, look.
Let's say...
...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.
And one-third is across this switch here.
All right? Okay?
And now another train is coming.
How far do you have to move this boxcar off the track...
...so that the other train doesn't smash it?
Quickly, Brad, there are thousands of lives at stake.
Brad, any answer.
Remember last weekend...
...you promised everybody a movie this weekend?
Honey?
- And you also promised Goofy Golf.
- Oh, yeah.
Roy, what is all this stuff on my table?
I thought I told you this was for my stuff.
I mean, you can have that table.
I don't want this on my table.
This can cause tetanus!
- What is this?!
- You know what's playing?
Pinocchio!
The kids have never seen Pinocchio.
You guys have never seen it.
You'll love it.
I don't believe this.
Who wants to go see some dumb cartoon rated G for kids?
- How old are you?
- Eight.
- You wanna be 9?
- Yeah.
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio tomorrow night.
That's a wonderful way to win over your children.
I'm not serious. I'm just saying that I grew up with Pinocchio.
And if kids are still kids, they're gonna eat it up.
Okay.
Okay, I'm wrong.
I'm Wrong Roy, all right?
Toby! You are close to death!
Come out here!
Okay, now, I'll give you your choice.
I'm not gonna be biased in any way.
You can either play Goofy Golf, which means a lot of waiting and pushing...
...or you can see Pinocchio...
...which is a lot of furry animals and magic and a wonderful time. Okay?
- Now, let's vote.
- Golf!
All right, everybody to bed!
No way! Dad said we could finish watching The Ten Commandments!
Roy, that movie is four hours long.
I told them they'd watch only five commandments.
- Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.
- Hi, Earl.
We got a big problem.
I need your old man in the field.
Roy can't drive at night without me.
We're experiencing an overall outage.
Wait, wait, wait, I can't... Hey, honey.
Jiminy Cricket!
It's Earl on the phone.
Just a second.
- Hello.
- Neary.
Get into your truck and report to line N in Tolono.
We're losing power across the grid.
Has the outage hit you yet?
Neary? Neary? Neary?
Hey! Lights!
Barry!
Barry!
Help! I'm lost.
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?
Cough up a Tolono or an interstate, a Highway 90.
A little familiar landmark of some sort.
- Cornbread Road, south of 20.
- Cornbread?
Power must have been restored.
Couple hundred neighbours think it's Saturday night.
Dispatch, this is 411.
Do you want me to disregard that Tolono call?
You're in the middle of the road, jackass!
Can you tell me where Cornbread is?
Turkey!
A-34... A-34... F-27.
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay.
Ten-47.
All right.
Stoppage in the single circuits will lead you right to nowhere.
M-Mary-10.
Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev...
Oh, shit.
Unit 211, I'm back up on the street.
What do you guys got out there?
I don't believe this!
My God! It's bigger than a house!
This thing is lik e a barn.
This is absolutely crazy.
What is your location?
Just off the Telemark Expressway and east toward Harper Valley.
Barry.
No!
Watch out!
Oh, my God! Lady! Lady!
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
I didn't see him.
He was in the middle of the road.
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.
- Hello! Here!
- What's the matter with you?
Barry, come back here!
Come on, now.
Ice cream!
This is nuts.
No.
Wait a minute!
What are you guys doing? Hey!
That's Ohio! That's a quarter!
Jesus, look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road!
Honey, wake up!
Ronnie, wake up!
You're not gonna believe what I saw!
Don't! Not now.
No, listen!
I never would have believed it!
There was this...
In the cab there was this whole...
It went... It was...
There was a red whoosh that...
Roy.
Ike called you.
And McGovern.
They want you to call.
They couldn't reach you.
I turned the radio off.
Don't do that.
The phone rang off the hook.
It woke Sylvia up two times already.
You'd better call them.
You know those pictures in National
Geographic, the aurora borealis?
This is better than that. This is really...
Come on!
Come on, Ronnie, get up. Come on.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I don't know.
- Get up! I'm not kidding.
- Is it an accident?
It's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house, right?
Not at 4:00 in the morning.
Ronnie, I need you to see something with me.
It's really important.
Okay. All right.
What about the kids?
What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids.
Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.
It's better than Goofy Golf!
I'm going as fast as I can!
Come on.
All right, all right.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris.
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.
There better be a good reason for this because it doesn't make any sense.
All right, Roy, I really think you've proved your point.
Roy. Roy.
Roy, you're sunburned. Look at you.
Honey, what is that?
Roy, what did it look like?
It was like an ice-cream cone.
What flavour?
Orange.
It was orange.
It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.
It was more like a shell.
You know, like this:
Like a taco?
Was it like one of those Sara Lee moon-shaped cookies?
Those crescent cookies?
Don't you think I'm taking this really well?
I remember coming to places like this just to look at each other.
Snuggle.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
It's the Cotopaxi.
- Why is it here?
- Beats the shit out of me.
Is this the bathroom?
Hey, this is not your toy to play with every time I turn around.
He looks like a 50l50 Bar.
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.
I'm sorry, but you're not to play with this!
Get out while I clean up your mess!
Thank you very much.
Roy, I found this overnight-tanning stuff.
I want you to spray it on half your face, so it's all one colour.
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of?
Then we'll tell everybody you fell asleep...
...under the sun lamp on your right side.
What for?
- Dad, can I ask you a question?
- What?
Are they for real?
That's what for.
No, they are not for real.
Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?
Ronnie, don't tell him that.
Roy, look, don't talk about this until you know what you're talking about.
If I can't talk about it, how will I know what's going on?
- What?
- Mom, I believe in them.
- I believe in them too.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Dad says we do.
No, he does not.
- Do you, Roy?
- Ronnie.
All I wanna do is know what's going on.
Nothing's going on!
It's just one of those things.
Which things? Which things?
- I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is very important!
I won't let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody!
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.
I saw something last night that I can't explain.
I saw something last night
I can't explain.
I'm going out there again tonight.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
Do they live on the moon?
They got bases there so at night they can come through your window.
This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it!
- You came through my window.
- You hurt me!
- You took all my covers.
- Roy's not like that.
He loves his work. Don't say that!
What did he do?
He was with us all night!
I won't have to go tonight.
He is not like that at all!
Stop yelling at me!
Can't you tell him about this?
Hello?
I can't believe it.
Roy...
...you got fired.
They didn't even wanna talk to you.
Where were the sounds coming from?
Where did these sounds come from?
Tell us, please.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I beg your pardon, but my English is not good too.
I want to share with you now...
...the breakthrough that happened in India.
We think it means something.
We think it is important.
To help you learn, I am using the hand sign created by Zoltán Kodály.
Kodály developed these signs to teach music to deaf children.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi, how are you? You came here too?
Yes. Jillian Guiler.
Roy Neary.
Sorry about what happened.
- Good night!
- What?
Look at you.
You got the same burn.
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.
I gotta tan the other side tonight.
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.
I'll be right back.
Raise your head a bit and give me a smile. Come on.
He's a little young for a record, don't you think?
Weird.
I know this sounds crazy, but ever since yesterday on the road...
...l've been seeing this shape.
In shaving cream and pillows...
Damn it, I know this!
I know what this is.
This means something.
This is important.
- Here they come!
- Get the camera!
- Out of the northwest!
- Jimmy, come here.
It's like Halloween for grownups.
Trick or treat.
Wait a minute!
Here are the patterns.
- We received two 15-minute broadcasts.
- Non-random signals?
104 rapid pulses. After a five-second interval, 40 pulses.
Another five-second break, and 30 pulses.
Silence, then a new set of numbers.
40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.
- 104 rapid pulses.
- Lord!
Wait 60 seconds and the whole doggone thing repeats.
- Where are the signals from?
- The neighbourhood.
Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.
Well within the plane of the ecliptic.
Are these non-random signals here,
40, 36, 10, in response to that?
No. They should be. We've sent this combination out for weeks.
But all we're getting back are numbers.
This could mean the India sounds reached a dead end.
They don't mean a thing.
There's so much we don't know.
How about where the signals originate?
Excuse me.
What letter is 104?
Excuse me.
Before I got paid to speak French...
...I used to read maps.
This first number is a longitude.
I've got two sets of three numbers.
Degrees, minutes and seconds.
The first number has three digits, and the last two are below 60.
It's not in the right ascension and declination on the sky.
These have to be Earth coordinates.
There's a globe in the office.
This is what we need.
Maybe there's a release pin underneath here.
That's a $2500 globe!
What are you doing?
- It's heavy, watch your feet.
- Let me hit the mother.
All right, everybody, quiet down!
Hold it down! Quiet!
That's not right.
The antenna. How dumb!
- Which way's it pointing?
- Northeast.
That's Wyoming.
We'll need a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.
I want it to the square yard.
The Army has a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.
We not only need...
Toys!
Toys!
Oh, my God!
You can come and play now.
You can come and play now.
Come in through the door.
One, two, three...
Oh, honey.
Mom, look! The sun's here!
Oh, honey.
Oh, my God!
Go away!
Clean everything up!
- Mom, let me listen!
- Wait a minute! Wait.
- Mom, look!
- Oh, my God.
Come in through the door.
Barry! Barry!
Jillian. Jillian.
May we have a statement?
The report you gave to the police was spectacular.
We need it for the 6:00 news.
They got him.
What?
Is it true you're leaving to look for your son?
- Has there been a ransom note?
- Where will you start looking?
His name is Barry.
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?
Are you involved in any kind of parapsychologies?
Turn around, please. Turn around!
You gave the police a report.
Would you mind repeating it?
Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer.
That's the one I saw!
I swear that's the same one!
It's the one I saw!
It's made of pewter, made in Japan...
...and thrown across the lawn by one of my children.
I wanted to point out that we're not all "polished brass" about this.
And also point out that last year...
...Americans shot more than seven billion photographs...
...at a record of $6.6 billion for film equipment and processing.
Now, with all those shutters clicking...
...where is the indisputable photographic evidence?
I've been in the news business for a long time.
We never took a picture of a plane crash as it happened...
...or an automobile accident and get it on the 6:00 news.
There are lots of ideas that would be fun to believe in.
Mental telepathy...
...time travel...
...immortality...
...even Santa Claus.
I know it's no fun to go home and say, "Guess what happened today?
I was in the shopping centre, and there was this bright light...
...and I rushed outside...
...and it was an aeroplane."
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't want to see this.
I sure wish I had.
For 15 years I've been looking...
...for these damn silly lights in the night sky.
I've never found any.
I'd like to, because
I believe in life elsewhere.
Why don't you admit...
...that the Air Force is conducting tests in the Foothills area?
It would be easy to say yes to that.
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.
I don't know what you saw.
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.
No, come on!
I saw Bigfoot once.
1951. Back in Sequoia National Park.
Had a foot on her, 37 inches.
Heel to toe.
Made a sound I would not want to hear twice in my life.
I believe I've encountered that gentleman myself.
I was sitting on the porch, looking through the screen.
I seen this big white dot in the sky.
It turned red and blue and green.
UFOs do not represent a direct physical threat to national security.
We do not support them, and we encourage you not to.
Let's get in touch with the forest service...
...or we'll end up in a wilderness area with vehicular traffic.
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff for those folks in Wyoming.
If this mission fully develops...
...I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.
Your flight will be at 2000 hours.
We have a limo that'll take you to the heliport now.
And transportation will be provided on the other end.
- I like the flash-flood idea.
- Where do you get the water?
We've had about two inches of rain...
We'll tell them one of the reservoirs is gonna burst.
Besides, there's not enough water in those reservoirs!
Wait! Contaminated water affects people, crops, animals.
Disease.
- Yeah, epidemic.
- What kind of disease?
A plague epidemic.
Nobody will believe a plague.
- Anthrax.
- Ranching country.
There are a lot of sheep in the hills.
Good, I like that.
- It'll create a panic.
- But it may not evacuate everybody.
There's always some joker who thinks he's immune.
I need something so scary it'll clear 300 square miles...
...of every living Christian soul.
Help yourself.
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.
It's okay.
Well, I guess you've noticed...
...something is a little strange with Dad.
It's okay, though.
I'm still Dad.
I can't describe it, what I'm feeling...
...and what I'm thinking.
This means something.
This is important.
That's not right.
It's not right.
That's not right.
What is it?
What is it?!
It's not fair.
Tell me.
Roy? Roy.
Open the door, please.
Please. Roy. Roy!
Open this door!
Open this door!
All right.
I don't think I know what's happening to me.
Look, Roy. What it is, is family therapy.
I mean, we all go. We all talk.
No one is singled out.
Maybe it's not your fault anyway.
- It's waterproof. It still works.
- Roy! Promise me you'll go!
You crybaby! You crybaby!
- You crybaby!
- Get out of here!
Get out!
Come on, you guys. Come on.
You crybaby!
- Be quiet!
- Stop it!
I don't understand it!
- Neither do I.
- Get out!
Go to your room and close the door.
- Ronnie?
- Yes.
I'm really scared.
I want you to help me.
All this bullshit!
It's turning this house upside down!
- Ronnie, just...
- I just hate you! That's why!
- No!
- Ronnie. Ronnie.
Hold me. Put your arms around me. It'll really help me.
It'll really help me.
Listen! Listen!
Don't you see what's happening?
None of our friends call us anymore!
You're out of work! You don't care!
You're wrecking us!
You're ruining us!
- Ronnie, just hold on.
- No! No!
- Hold on.
- No!
Ronnie.
Ronnie?
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.
Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.
Happy birthday, you thing from another world, you.
Thank you!
Well, I guess he's had enough.
Are you going to yell at me?
Ronnie? Everything's fine.
All this stuff is coming down.
It's all gonna be like it was.
That's the last straw!
Now I use my secret weapon!
Roy?
Roy, I'm sorry about last night. Roy!
Roy, what are you doing?
Jesus!
The plants are fine there!
Can you hear me?
Wait!
Wait! What are you doing?
You're gonna love it!
- What do you mean?
- You'll really love this.
Roy, what are you doing?
Oh, Roy!
My God!
Come on, men!
Dad, after this, can we throw dirt in my window?
Stop it.
Stop. Stop it.
Honey!
If I don't do this, that's when
I'm gonna need a doctor.
What are you doing?
- I got it.
- What are you doing?
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?
You ever look at something crazy, and then see it another way and it's not?
No, I haven't.
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and hold your breath, everything will be really pretty.
You're scaring us now.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
I feel really good.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I haven't felt this good in years.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I can feel it.
- Now what else? What else?
- Like this? Like this?
Right.
Like this?
Chicken wire.
Whatever you're doing, it's against the law!
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.
I'll pay you for this.
Take it. Take it.
I'm perfectly fine.
Let go of this fence.
Come with me.
Do you want me to hit you?
Let go of that fence!
Toby! Listen to me. Listen to me.
Come on, right now.
We're going.
- I want to stay here!
- Let go of the fence! Come on.
Stay! Stay!
- Where we going?
- Where we going?
- Where are we going?
- Get in the car.
- Where are we going?
- Quietly, quickly, get in.
Get in there, Toby.
Quickly.
- Dad needs some more help!
- Lock the doors!
Dad needs some more help!
Quiet! Just lock the doors.
Roll up those windows.
Dad needs some more help!
Honey, where you going?
- What?
- Where are you going?
Taking the kids to my sister's.
That's crazy.
You're not even dressed.
What?
You said what?
Ronnie, wait!
Ronnie, hold it.
Would you hold it one minute?
Morning.
What is wrong with me today?
Who is it, please?
It's the mailman. There's a package for Julie Anderson.
You can just leave it at the door!
I can't do that.
I'm supposed to C. O.D. Lik e that.
And besides...
...you and I have to have a little talk...
...about Kim.
Lik e sands through the hourglass...
...so are the Days of Our Lives.
Good evening. At the top of the news tonight, a rail disaster.
At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...
...a trainload of dangerous chemical gas went off the rails...
...and forced the widest area evacuation...
...in the history of these controversial Army rail shipments.
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.
I can do other things.
I'm trying to be.
Yes, I am.
The Army and National Guard are supervising the evacuation.
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.
It was a joke!
- The danger will be over within 72 hours.
Ronnie, anything you want.
Anything you want, I'll do.
For how long?
All of you?
No. Ronnie, I wanna talk about this in person.
This is not... We can't talk about this on the telephone.
Ronnie! Don't hang up!
Just don't...
- meat should remain unaffected.
This means order your steak well-done.
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was the first national monument...
...erected in this country by
Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.
Thousands of civilian refugees are fleeing the area...
...spurred by rumours that the overturned tank er cars...
...at Walkashi Needles Junction were filled to capacity with nerve gas.
In a few minutes, we're going to be...
- boasts 400, 000 vacationers.
Fortunately, during this mishap there have been no fatalities.
- Evacuate this area, which soon...
...will become the "hot zone," depending on the prevailing winds.
This is as close to the disaster as we've been allowed to get.
- Due to a strong prevailing north-south wind.
Army engineers and the
Wyoming National Guard...
...are making every effort to contain the leaking toxins...
...and evacuate an area of almost
200 square miles.
Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.
Everyone, please, stay out of the area.
- And thousands of others are homeless.
U.S. Army Materiel Command has issued these new area restrictions:
All roadways north of Crowheart on
Interstate 25.
Shit.
All roads leading into the
Grand Tetons west of Meteste.
All multilane undivided full-traffic interchange...
...railroad, local and historic stage roads south of Cody.
Why aren't there fat lines instead of these thin ones?
Yo!
- Holy mother of...
- You're going the wrong way!
Yo! Turn back around. Back this way.
What's the matter with you?
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.
It's just a rental, officer.
Just a rental.
My fault! My fault!
Starting with the letter "F," as in "Frank"...
...to the letter "J" as in "Jack"...
...please find your way to the loading platform for immediate boarding.
You'll be real disappointed and sorry...
...if you don't have an early-warning system, such as a bird, a gas mask.
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.
And any of you folks are worth more than a dog.
Roy? Roy!
Roy!
Roy?
Roy?
Roy!
Roy.
Roy!
I don't care where you go, just get behind the barricade!
There's no way out!
What are we doing?
Only way to get back is cross-country.
We'll break through the fence.
- Let's go.
- All right, hold on. Hold on.
The police dragged the river for him.
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't.
Then they went around to every house within five miles...
...looking inside back-yard refrigerators.
They asked if I'd seen any strangers in the neighbourhood.
I don't believe it's real.
I don't believe it's real.
It's real.
Let's get down there. Get some gas and get down in there.
What are those?
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.
What do you want?
Get your hands off!
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine!
According to my birds, the only bad air is from you guys farting around!
- Move them out!
- What's happening?
- What? Where are we going?
- Go to the van.
Where are you taking her?
Hold it! Why can't we go together?
Watch your step.
Roy.
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.
- Hello.
- We need answers from you...
...that are honest, direct and to the point.
Where is Jillian?
Do you realise the danger you and your friend have risked?
In coming here, you've exposed yourself to toxic gas.
Well, I'm alive.
We're talking.
This is true, Mr. Neary.
But if the wind blew from the south instead of the north...
...this conversation would not be taking place.
There's nothing wrong with the air.
What makes you say that?
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.
Go outside and make me a liar.
I wanna talk to the man in charge.
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.
He isn't even an American.
Mr. Neary, are you an artist or a painter?
No.
Have you been hearing a persistent ringing in your ears?
Almost an agreeable ringing?
No.
Having headaches, migraines?
Yeah.
An irritation in your eyes and your sinuses?
Yeah.
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?
And burning on your face and on your body?
- Yes. Who are you people?
- Look at this.
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you people?
Monsieur Neary, please, one more question.
Have you recently had a close encounter?
A close encounter with something very unusual?
Who are you people?
- These people strangers to you?
- Yeah. Except for her.
And the two of you felt compelled to be here?
Yeah, you might say that.
- But what did you expect to find?
- An answer.
That's not crazy, is it?
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Is that it?
Is that all you're gonna ask me?
Well, I got a couple of thousand goddamn questions.
I wanna speak to someone in charge.
I wanna lodge a complaint.
You have no right to make people crazy.
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?
If this is just nerve gas, how come I know everything in such detail?
I've never been here before.
How come I know so much?
What the hell is going on around here?!
Who the hell are you people?!
Is that it?! Answer me!
I didn't come this far to get taken on any bus ride home!
Five minutes. Five!
We're gonna hold for a couple of minutes.
You brought 12 people to the decontamination camp...
...instead of the evacuation centre where they belong. Why?
- Because this means something.
- This means something.
These people have come from all over their country...
...to a place they've been told will endanger their lives.
Why?
Because somebody could be trying to subvert this whole operation...
...by sending in fanatics, cultists and Christ knows what all.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
This is a small group of people...
...who have shared a vision in common.
Look.
It's still a mystery to me why they are here.
Even they do not know why.
Jillian!
- Jillian.
- Don't! You'll be poisoned!
Listen, there's nothing wrong with the air around here.
The Army's getting us out because they don't want any witnesses.
If the Army doesn't want us here, it's none of our business.
We wanted to see the mountain.
It was a coincidence when I painted it.
You can take it off!
The air here is better than in Los Angeles.
Listen. How many of you people are for getting out of here?
I don't know what's happening either.
I must find out what's going on.
For every one of these anxious, anguished people who've come here...
...there must be hundreds more touched by the vision who never made it here.
Simply because they never watch the television.
Or perhaps they watched it, but never made the psychic connection.
It's a coincidence. It's not scientific.
Listen to me, Major Walsh...
...it is an event sociological.
Hey! Wait a minute!
- My name's Neary!
- Larry Butler!
- How are you?
- Okay! You?
- Fine, fine!
- That's good!
Everybody keep their masks on until you're out of here and out of danger.
Listen, we wanna get out of here!
What's the matter with you?
- Major Walsh, Major Walsh.
- Yes, sir.
I'll have the rest of them off the mountain in one hour.
Major, I want you to use infrared...
...and get me a photo analysis of the northern face.
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.
Major Walsh, listen.
I don't lik e to do this. We're in enough trouble with these cattlemen.
If you can't get these folks out of the area by 2000 hours...
...start dusting with EZ-4.
What's EZ-4?
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we used with the livestock.
Comes out of Riot Control.
They'll sleep for six hours and wake up with a headache, that's all.
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people!
They were invited!
They belong here more than we.
I shouldn't have given up jogging.
See that notch in the mountain?
We'll make it in no time.
Here come three more.
The authority in this park...
...has been superseded by the United States government.
There's a ravine leading straight up.
- It's an easier climb.
- It's no good.
When you get to the top, it's a 300-foot drop down. Get down!
What do you think is down on the other side?
There's a box canyon on the other side with ravines and trails...
...if you take this incline to the right.
I never imagined that.
I only painted one side.
- There was no canyon in my doodles.
- Next time, sculpt.
You give us a lot of credit.
That's an hour's climb.
Come on, let's go.
The authority in this park...
...has been superseded by the United States government.
You are entering a military reservation...
...and subject to military law.
Call the bastard.
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.
Go ahead.
Nothing to report at midstation.
Up ahead there's thousands of places to hide.
We'll need three times the men to cover this in one hour.
Get everybody off the northern face, call the dark side of the moon...
...and tell them we're gonna dust.
Get down!
You are entering a military reservation...
...and subject to military law.
Larry! Larry, come on!
Larry! Don't let them see you!
Get down!
They're just crop-dusting.
Los Angeles!
- Larry?
- Don't stop!
Don't look back! Come on, come on!
Roy!
Hurry! We're only 10 feet from the top.
Just a few more feet! We can slide down the other side!
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.
Don't come down.
Come on, come on. Come on!
- Don't worry. We'll make it.
- Roy.
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Move your ass!
Come on.
Roy, come on. Come on.
Please, come on.
Hurry!
Hold it!
Jump! Jump!
- Do you see that?
- Oh, yes.
Good.
Is it on?
Check the speak er system here.
I want this up all the way.
Are you reading me on this one?
How about here?
- Testing. Testing.
- Okay, one, two, three, four.
Testing. Testing.
One, two, three, testing.
Gentlemen, ladies.
Tak e your positions, please.
This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.
Could we have the lights in the arena down 60 percent, please?
60 percent.
I don't think we could ask for a more beautiful evening, do you?
Okay, watch the skies, please.
We now show uncorrelated targets approaching from the north-northwest.
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.
You see that?
Yes.
Good.
All ground personnel not
D-class approved...
...please evacuate the centre approach mark er.
Audio analysis personnel, behind the double yellow line.

Auto ready?
- Tone interpolation on interlock.
- Altitude and tabling.
ARP and interlock now.
Speed set at seven and a half.
All positive functions, standing by.
Go ahead.
- Sunset.
- Go.
Okay. Start with the tone.
- Tang.
- Go.
Up a full tone.
Down a major third.
Now drop an octave.
- Cool blue.
- Go.
Up a perfect fifth.
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Give me a tone.
- "Re" to the second.
- Up a full tone.
- "Mi" to the third.
- Down a major third.
- "Do" to the first.
- Drop an octave.
"Do" up a perfect fifth.
"Sol" to the fifth.
I know that.
Faster.
Kick that mule!
Let's go!
I'm very happy tonight.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Not a Merle Haggard, but it was great.
Mr. Lacombe?
What is it? What's happening?
Come on. Come on, let's go.
Keep down.
They're talking way over my head.
- Shit.
- Duck, duck!
Photo one.
Fantastic! Keep those reloads coming.
Fantastic!
- You wanna see better?
- I can see fine.
- We can't stay here.
- I can.
- Why?
- Because Barry's not here.
I'm just not ready.
I can't stay.
I've gotta get down there.
I know.
This is data control to all personnel.
We monitor no biologic hazards.
Range safety clear.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Holy shit.
There is a safety-hazard zone...
...extending 25 metres from the ship.
Special teams are exempt and should be aware of low gravity.
Expect some dizziness, and look out for a static charge.
All departments at operational during this phase...
...signify by beeping twice.
If everything's ready here on the dark side of the moon...
...play the five tones.
Give her six quavers, then pause.
She sent us four quavers...
...a group of five quavers, a group of four semiquavers.
All these phrases have in common are five signals.
- Hope somebody's taking all this down.
- What are we saying to each other?
It seems they're trying to teach us a basic tonal vocabulary.
It's the first day of school.
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.
We have a translation interlock on their audio signal.
We're taking over this conversation now.
Let's go! Come on!
I am Claude Lacombe.

I just wanna know that it's really happening.
I went up in the air, and I saw our house.
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?
- Yes.
- Yes?
All right, now we have to talk.
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.
Swensen, Matthew Daniel...

- Are they going away?
- Yes.
Wait a second, wait.
He says these are ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances.

Show us your ways.
And lead us along your paths.
God has given you his angels charge over you.
Grant these pilgrims, we pray, a happy journey...
...and peaceful days, so that with your holy angel as a guide...
...they may safely reach their destination...
Bye!
Outerspace.
Limitless and timeless.
Filled with cosmic explosions and endless turbulence.
An infinite playground for that occasional blazing visitor, the comet.
At first comets terrified man.
He thought they were signals of impending catastrophe.
But he got used to them and he gave names to them and waited for them to drop by like old friends.
This one has come from behind the sun, moving across the heavens at 108.000 miles an hour, and has never before been seen by man.
The asteroid belt.
A vast junkyard of metal and rock orbiting the sun between Jupiter and Mars.
Thousands of fragments, some as small as a fist some as large as a city.
And amongst these Orpheus.
Twenty mlles in diameter and undisturbed for countless generations...
...until now.
Give me the horn.
What do you want?
- Is Dr Paul Bradley aboard?
- Who's asking?
I've got orders from NASA to bring in Dr Paul Bradley.
Is he aboard? This is an emergency.
So's this. We're trying to win a race.
We're going to have to cut across your bow.
All right goddammit. We're coming in.
Mr Sherwood told me to get you off the boat and on your way to Houston.
There's a special jet for you.
- You would've cut across my bow?
- Yes, sir.
I would've rammed you.
And gone straight to the bottom, sir.
Don't go away. I could be right back.
Dr Bradley, it's good to see you again.
Good to see you again.
- You owe me $10.
- I do?
- I got my handicap down to 12.
- No wonder it's good to see me again.
- Yes?
- Bradley's here.
Good. Send him in.
It's yours. Mr Sherwood..
Oh, good to see you. Come in, come in.
- Sorry to do this to you.
- Not at all.
Yes, I did that I called Helen and asked her to send your clothes.
Hello? Mr Sherwood.'s office.
I, uh...
I didn't know that you and she were...
- You've met General Easton.
- Once, in Washington.
- Good of you to come.
- Sam Mason, CAP commander.
Peter Watson, our flight director.
Put that down and let me fix you a small Scotch.
A large one.
- Good.
- We could all use one, I think.
Why don't we sit around the table?
Take your coat off.
- How big is your boat?
- Fifty-two feet
An awful lot's been happening here,
Paul. And none of it good.
Harry, I left NASA five years ago.
- Why am I back?
- Let me tell you.
Gentlemen, help yourselves.
Seven days ago, Palomar Observatory reported the discovery of a new comet.
- General.
- Thank you.
Nothing unusual in that
They spot nine or ten every year, either themselves or other observatories.
But... it's where this one seemed to be going.
- The asteroid belt
- Go on.
When they called me, it was a couple of hundred thousand miles from the belt.
Challenger ll, our space probe to Mars, was in the vicinity.
General Easton's son,
Tom, was commanding.
We got in touch with them, and then we...
I...
...changed their programme.
That was last Friday.
Challenger II, do you read me?
We read you.
How do you feel about making a slight detour?
Anything to break the monotony.
What do you call slight?
Two days, four hours and 32 minutes.
What happens to our schedule?
Don't concern yourself, Tom.
We'll take care of everything.
- Mars will have to wait.
- Whatever you say.
- Where are we going?
- The asteroid belt
- What for?
- A Comet's about to go through it.
- They go through all the time.
- It's a first for this one.
It was wrenched out of orbit by Jupiter's gravitational pull.
- How big is this comet?
- 480 kilometres in diameter, which makes its nucleus large enough to do real damage if it hits anything.
It's headed straight toward Orpheus, the big one in the centre.
Where do we park?
Park alongside Vesta, about 25,000 kilometres this side.
You'll be there three hours before the comet.
We want all the information you can give us on size and orbital elements.
- Take a few pictures?
- A lot of pictures.
We've already started things down here.
You'll change course in five minutes.
- Is my old man with ya?
- He's here.
- Tell him hello.
- Will do.
As I said before, that was last Friday.
Yesterday, Sunday morning, at 1100 hours, they started to pull up alongside Vesta.
- We got it?
- Yes, we've got it
- Can you zoom in on Orpheus for us?
- Can do.
Beautiful.
- Let's have some information.
- I'll take some measurements.
For the next hour and a half, they read the belt for us.
Then what we were waiting for finally appeared.
Magnetic field measuring zero.
It'll go straight through like salt.
It's gonna hit it!
- Get away from there.
- It's coming apart in a million pieces!
I don't think I can ever forgive myself.
- I should have figured...
- No guilt Harry.
- We'd all have given the same orders.
- Who knows about this?
Nobody at the moment.
We'll have put out a release right after this meeting.
Why am I here?
A chunk of Orpheus is heading towards Earth, a pretty big one.
There are a lot of little pieces with it and in front of it
It's the big one we're worried about
The figures haven't been worked out, but six days from now we could be hit.
- We have to be prepared.
- That's why we put Hercules up there.
Will you let me finish?
I've convened a meeting at NASA headquarters in Washington for tomorrow.
Lucas, Steinberg, Fillmore, others you know will be there.
I want you to come to that meeting.
- I'll come to your meeting.
- We appreciate it Paul.
I've delayed a flight
You're leaving in one hour.
Up-to-date material on Hercules.
Something to read.
Your hotel room has been booked.
Gladys has your expense arrangements.
Why don't you stick a broom up my arse?
I could sweep the carpet on the way out.
Haven't changed, have you?
See you in the morning.
The Coast Guard  towed
Rob Samuelson to harbour...
Among the other nine who failed to finish was Dr Peterson's Maverick, who was disqualified for crossing the line prior to start.
John Slabin's Mary Bee collided with Arnold Parker's Swan.
Both suffered sufficient damage to withdraw.
The big surprise was Paul Bradley's Blithe Spirit, which withdrew for no apparent reason early in the race.
John Dunning had a running battle with...
- Hello.
- it's late, I wanted to...
Paul. Where are you?
Why aren't you on the boat?
Uh, Washington.
- How are the kids?
- Jimmy's got a cold.
And Julie's bound to get it and we're still fighting about homework.
Apart from that, they're fine.
- What are you doing in Washington?
- I'm not sure yet
I was phoning to let you know where I am.
How are you?
Oh... Not bad, you know.
- Paul?
- Tell the kids I love them.
A chunk of Orpheus is heading towards Earth.
A big one. There are a lot of little pieces with it and in front of it.
But it's the big one we're worried about.
The figures haven't been worked out, but six days from now we could he hit.
Sorry I'm late.
You and everybody else.
- Let me tell you about that
- Either we're in the wrong room, or a lot of brainpower's lost.
Nobody else is coming.
- Lucas, Fillmore, Steinberg?
- I didn't ask them.
- Why not?
- You know why not
Because we don't need them!
You. You originated Hercules.
Out it out, Paul. I know how you feel.
- Dredging up old...
- I'm dredging up nothing.
- I can taste it right now.
- Now, look
It wasn't my decision to turn Hercules...
- Into what?
- Will you listen to me?
It wasn't designed as a nuclear weapon, with 14 warheads pointed at Russia.
- Not only Russia.
- Or China. Whatever else!
Those rockets were supposed to point outwards, not in!
They were meant to defend us against the threat we're facing now.
- Didn't I yell at them?
- Yeah.
- Didn't I stand up for you?
- Yes.
Then listen to me.
Will you listen to me?
That meteor's five miles wide and it's definitely gonna hit us!
It would make a hole big enough to put the Atlantic in.
Shit Five miles.
Now walk out!
And General Adlon? Isn't he in charge?
Adlon's a good man, technically.
But he's two-dimensional.
You know that.
We've got to find a way to move him out.
That's problem number one.
Problem number two, there are about 100 guys stupid enough to resist using Hercules because of what it would mean politically.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Help me ride over them.
OK you son of a bitch. I'll help, but i want it straight up and down.
You've got my word.
Those rockets have got to be realigned and we've got exactly five days.
I hope no one has been so foolish to contact the Russians about all this.
It would be inadvisable...
No one would think of doing that without your approval, Mr Secretary.
You can be sure they know all there is to know about the meteor.
They don't know what we're planning to do.
What we're discussing.
I hope it's still discussion.
General Adlon, I assure you that no decisions have been made.
That's what this meeting's been called for, to decide what to do.
You're in charge of Project Hercules.
If the result of this meeting is to make use...
There's nothing else.
The only thing we've got is Hercules.
Dammit Hercules is not up there either, as far as anybody but we are concerned.
It's got to stay that way.
We have never admitted to Hercules.
- If we admit to it now...
- We have to!
You can't keep the whole world in the dark about what's going on.
Once they know that a five-mile hunk of rock is gonna hit at 30,000 mph, people will want to know what we intend to do about it.
You're gonna tell the entire world we have nuclear rockets out there in direct contradiction to every international agreement we've ever made?
That's an invitation to being called liars and warmongers by every...
It's international murder if we don't!
What do you want to do?
You want to meet it with BB guns and slingshots?
Please! Gentlemen!
Dr Bradley, would you please tell us what would happen if this meteor struck us?
A massive rock, one mile wide, travelling at 30,000 miles per hour, would cause a crater 50 miles across and five miles deep.
Orpheus is five miles wide.
Its striking force is equal to...
...2,500,000 megatons of TNT.
That is ten orders of magnitude above the largest earthquake ever recorded.
It would throw into the atmosphere five billion tons of earth, and reduce solar radiation for decades to come.
It could cause another Ice Age.
What if the thing doesn't hit?
There's some chance.
- Every scientific facility...
- You have been wrong!
You were wrong to send Challenger II off its course!
I don't have to listen to this!
Please!
You're out of order!
At ease, gentlemen.
Dr Bradley, where are you going?
I need air.
I don't give a damn what Russia says about America or vice versa.
I told you what's gonna happen when that meteor hits.
If you think you can prevent it by burying your heads under a blanket of shit fine.
If you reach a decision,
I'll be in the bar across the street.
I'll have to discuss this at the White House.
In time, because there's damn little time.
We are now going to replay a recording of a broadcast made by them earlier today.
The British Cabinet met to discuss the announcement by Jodrell Bank Observatory that a piece of an asteroid knocked out of orbit by a comet is on possible collision course with Earth.
In less than a week, this giant object could strike our planet, causing untold damage and great loss of life.
The Prime Minister is in consultation with the American President...
Put the game on!
...and volunteered every assistance the government can give.
We consider it deplorable that the American people should he dependent on the BBC to supply us with facts that we have a right to know.
I consider it deplorable
I don't have a drink.
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch.
- A large one.
- A large one.
What happened?
They're calling the President.
What if he says no?
A couple of years ago, my son, Andy, started to complain about pains in his stomach.
All the junk food kids eat,
I wasn't a bit surprised.
But he kept on complaining.
I had a talk with Miriam and we decided to take him to a doctor.
Just for an opinion, you understand.
Appendicitis, the doctor said.
Miriam said, "Let's wait till tomorrow.
The pain will go away. "
You know my Miriam. She can't stand the thought of an operation.
That night when she went to bed, she cried herself to sleep.
I went and picked him up and took him to a hospital.
Six hours later his appendix was out, he was feeling better, and Miriam... Miriam was all smiles.
You get my point?
Yeah.
How do you sneak me into a position where I can fire nuclear warheads without Miriam knowing?
I'll do it, if I can't do it any other way.
Is there a Mr Sherwood. here?
- Yeah, that's me.
- Telephone, right through there.
Thanks.
Mr Secretary, I'd rather not call back
I'd appreciate it if you held on.
Yes, Dr Bradley is checking out the information to verify.
Yes, sir, I do think it's urgent.
- No, sir. Paul.
- In a minute.
It's coming up now, sir.
- What do I tell him?
- How good is his health?
- Confirmed?
- Confirmed. Hercules is light.
Mr Secretary, it's been confirmed.
So, what you're telling me is that...
...even if we admit to Hercules and I give you my permission to realign the rockets, we still need more firepower?
More nuclear mega-tonnage?
More rockets?
That's right Mr President.
- Mr Secretary, do we have more rockets?
- Not in space, sir.
What are we supposed to do, conjure them out of air?
Mr President, would you confirm what I'm about to say?
The Russians have their own equivalent of Hercules out in space.
True or not true?
True.
Mr President, we need the combined power of theirs and ours.
- They'll never admit it
- We'll make them.
- How?
- General Adlon, for the time being, until this crisis is resolved,
I am putting Dr Bradley in charge of Operation Hercules.
I rely on you to give him every aid and assistance.
- I hope I'm public-spirited enough...
- I'm sure you are.
Listen, I think I have a solution to this problem.
- Where will you be this evening?
- We're flying to New York.
Make sure you hear my broadcast at 8.00.
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
You'll ask what steps have been taken to make sure that this meteor never comes near the Earth's surface.
I'm happy to tell you that realizing that such an emergency as this could arise, your government, in collaboration with the best scientific brains at its disposal, developed a project to deal with this emergency.
That project has been named Hercules.
What is Hercules?
Hercules is an armed, orbiting satellite its nuclear weaponry almed toward outerspace.
Right name. Wrong direction.
What can Hercules do?
It can send, at the press of a botton, enough power to destroy any foreign body on a collision course with our planet.
But, in this case, a special circumstance has arisen.
The meteor is of such size and velocity that even this powerful weapon...
...cannot do the job entirely.
Fortunately, the Russians, with the same foresight that we possessed, mounted their own defense weapon.
We do not know what the Russians have called their weapon, but we know it exists.
And we are going to ask them to combine their nuclear power with ours, so that together we will be able to deal with the meteor, to strike it with irresistible force and to end forever its potential danger to us all.
I will, myself, be speaking with the Russians
Immediately after
I finish this broadcast.
- The game is on.
- Good night.
And God bless you.
Hello?
- Do you have a pass for Dr Bradley?
- Good morning, sir.
- General Adlon come in yet?
- Half an hour ago.
- How far down?
- Right next to an old subway station, a section that runs under the Hudson.
It made it easy for us to bring the equipment in and it saved millions.
Why not some sensible place, like Houston?
Mm-mmm.
This has easy access to a total telecommunications set-up above us.
Nobody in their right minds would put their most important emergency striking power under the busiest city in the world.
This is Dr Bradley.
Can I see your pass, sir?
Would you mind signing it sir?
Thank you.
Command to Internal.
Central Control, call 8-1-2-4.
General Adlon, most impressive.
Thank you. A message for you.
Normally we work with 25, but since it's an emergency i brought in the full crew.
Good news.
The Russians are coming.
I consider allowing the Russians to come into this centre a grave error, which one day the United States may bitterly regret.
- I'd like to meet the staff.
- Of course.
General, may I use your office for a moment?
Certainly. This way.
This is our chief technician,
Rolf Manheim.
- Rolf.
- Dr Bradley.
You have been teaching my nephew at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
- Ben Manheim.
- Yes.
He's a bright boy.
He'll be teaching me in a couple years.
All stations give status now.
This is our trajectory analysis officer,
Jan Watkins.
- Hello.
- I suppose you're tied into 1180?
No. At 360, with a custom-designed memory.
Like I said, I'll be asking you and your computer a lot of questions.
- We'll give you prompt answers.
- Triple-checked.
My assistant, Alan Marshall.
Dr Bradley, I've got Sir Michael Hughes from the Jodrell Bank Observatory.
He'd like a word with you.
Excuse me.
I'm Bill Hunter, in charge of tracking.
What else are you linked with?
Hong Kong, Arecibo and New South Wales.
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good evening, Paul.
I didn't expect to see you until Wimbledon.
Assuming there'll be a Wimbledon.
What have you got?
Expect the first splinters in 24 hours.
Doubtful if we can track them unless they're in clusters. We'll do our best.
- Anything else?
- No. I just wanted to make contact.
We'll keep in constant touch.
Until then.
Paul, the Russian astrophysicist you asked for?
- Dr Dubov?
- He's arriving at 7.30 this evening.
Dr Dubov, are we glad to see you here!
Thank you.
Twenty-two, 47, colon, 56 point 55.
He assumes this is an accurate representation of the satellite.
Or is the direction of the rocket just accidental?
I am not prepared to volunteer strategic information.
- Is that what I said?
- Yes, sir.
- Please.
- Thank you.
What striking power does it carry?
I'd prefer you got that from Dr Bradley.
Good morning.
Fourteen rockets, each carrying a 100 megaton bomb.
Welcome to New York Dr Dubov.
- Everything in duplicate?
- It's a procedure.
How else do we know we're being interpreted properly?
I think we could all start by trusting each other.
Otherwise, what's the point?
If it's a matter of choosing,
I'll take the pretty one.
The pretty one is Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya.
- Did I say it right?
- Very good.
Astrophysicist and Dr Dubov's English voice.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
The captain is General Adlon's Russian voice.
- Sir.
- Hi.
Since it appears we are redundant here, if you'll excuse us.
Mr Sherwood.,
I'd like to see you outside.
I'll see if I can't calm him down.
He thinks General Adlon is not pleased to see him.
- I know this is difficult for you...
- Mr Sherwood!
I spoke to the Secretary of Defense, who seems more aware of the complexity of the situation.
- But...
- His orders are, and I quote,
"No change in the direction of rockets until the Russians admit they've got their own and agree to realign them. "
- Is that understood?
- Look.
Why don't you Xerox
100 copies of that report, pass them out among
100 guys in Washington, then organise
100 meetings to discuss it
By that time the meteor will have hit and we won't have any more problems.
He doesn't mean to criticize, but you will not find it easy to hit a meteor with your warheads pointing toward the USSR.
We call ours Hercules.
What do you call yours?
How can one give a name to that which does not exist
Then who put up this thing called Peter the Great its warheads pointing at the United States?
Chinese, perhaps.
Dr Dubov, we've gota slight problem.
If Peter the Great does not exist, we are out of business.
But if it does exist,
I'd have to know what weapons it would be carrying...
...where it was...
...and what frequencies we would have to use to align it with Hercules.
Now, for purposes of discussion only...
He understands the importance of your questions.
If he had been involved in construction of such an illegal weapon...
...he could then, of course, theoretically, answer those questions.
Then would you be prepared, theoretically, of course...
...to work out the details with me as to how we link the satellites?
Yes, he would be ready.
Before that, what would you have designed your striking power to be?
Sixteen rockets, each carrying mega-tonnage, the same as your own.
That gives us a billion plus.
Theoretically.
Theoretically.
I give the floor to the first speaker on my list, a representative of Canada.
We have information that a disturbance of earthquake proportions has occurred somewhere in Siberia.
I believe that all of us here are aware of that fact.
Would the Russian delegate tell us what was the cause of the disturbance?
Mr President, we would like to request a recess while we consult further with our government.
At my next mark, it will be 2300.
- We are in test number 36.
- Good morning.
- Did you get any sleep last night?
- A couple of hours. You?
I played gin rummy and lost.
What's the Russian girl like?
Very nice, very bright and forget it.
I missed you.
...approaching X plus six minutes on the attitude control test and all station monitors are green.
With compliments.
I had them strip your bed and put on some proper sheets.
- That's kind.
- I've got some decent soap, because using the stuff here is like washing your hands with a rock.
- Thank you. That's a pretty scarf.
- Thank you.
Will Jim Jackson report to the security office.
His hours are confused.
- How about you?
- Oh, I'm all right
System analysis team will review power problems at 0800 tomorrow in conference room.
- Should I wake him?
- Let him sleep. Have some coffe.
Commands for attitude control updates programmed in Hercules.
How long have you been with him?
I've known him for ten years.
But I've only worked with him for five.
Why did you choose astrophysics?
- It chose me.
- How?
I was a telephone operator at a centre for controller flight in a cosmodrome by Kannur in Middle Asia.
I knew your language because when I was a child my mother kept giving me books in English and telling me that one day
I would be grateful to her.
I suppose I am. Would you like one?
No, thanks. Go on.
Then, about ten years ago, some British scientists came to Russia to meet with some of our people.
Alexei Serich, our Sleeping Beauty, needed someone to translate for him, and they asked me.
His English voice.
When I finished, he asked me to stay on with him as interpreter and third assistant.
He was married to Olga Alekseevna then, his first wife.
- How many's he had?
- He's on his fourth.
He's sleeping alone now, but just not very often.
You know, it's very nice talking with you.
Thank you.
We've been talking for almost two days.
No. I've been talking with you and Dubov.
I mean talking with "you", you.
- Very attractive.
- Thank you, again.
- Then...
- Then?
- Astrophysics.
- Oh!
Well, I realized that space fascinated me.
Alexei Serich saw this and he encouraged me.
He arranged for me to go to university.
And when I returned,
I was an astrophysicist.
- That's when I met my husband.
- Your husband?
He was a cosmonaut
We were together for three years.
And then he went on an exploratory mission, and he didn't come back.
And now? Is there anyone?
Nothing serious. Not really.
Dr Bradley,
Sir Michael is reporting on the monitor.
There are meteors over Central Europe.
Ah, Paul, the observatory in Frascati is reporting.
There's a cluster big enough to track coming in over Italy south of Pisa.
Speed of approach,
15,000 metres per second.
They've burnt up!
The clusters evaporated.
Frascati says that not one of them got through.
The whole thing's been nothing more than a gigantic fireworks display.
Thank you. That's the best news yet
We'll try and keep it that way.
Bradley!
I think we can assume the emergency's over.
This one, and the emergency in general.
It's a pity the world's been sent into a state of unnecessary panic.
There's your threat,
Dr Bradley, a fireworks display!
Tell this arsehole once and for all,
Orpheus will not burn up. It's too big!
We've got enough to deal with here.
We don't need any additional aggravation from you!
Not one promise of calamity has come true.
As far as I'm concerned, not a single one will!
When common sense is restored and the President has returned the control of this centre to me,
I shall return to this centre!
He wishes to telephone the Russian Embassy in Washington.
The USSR is not unaware of the seriousness of this situation.
We have, therefore, decided to add to the power of Hercules the considerable power that we, ourselves, possess.
A satellite, developed before the United States developed theirs.
But which we designed and constructed for the purpose of defense against possible disasters such as the one confronting us now.
For that purpose only!
The USSR will always support any exercise, the primary object of which is to the benefit of mankind.
- To Peter the Great.
- To the Russian cutting of red tape.
Peter the Great.
Dr Dubov would like to tell you words he heard from a taxi driver when he was last in America.
Walk the Dodgers!
Attitude correction complete.
Situation nominal.
This is Goldstone.
We have a realignment interrupt.
Realignment Interrupt. Copy.
Readjustment malfunction.
Deployment latch relay on rocket three may he hung up.
We have to re-set.
Send back-up command and update the guidance systems to account for the delayed firing time.
Co-variance matrix has been recalculated.
All Hercules back-up syslems are ready.
Attitude correction complete.
Situation nominal.
We wait till we see the whites of its eyes.
0700 Sunday. lt is eight hours since a splinter struck the Swiss Alps.
Only now has the enormity of what has happened begun to sink in.
There's never been anything like this.
Avalanches and storms have destroyed whole villages, but nothing on the scale of what's here.
Help is coming from all over, ambulances, helicopters, rescue equipment and supplies.
Dead casualties are being taken to churches and town halls.
Those still alive are rushed to hospitals for resuscitation.
So many skiers and holiday-makers here atthis time of year, and many of them are unregistered.
There's no way of telling who they are.
Anyone who has reason to believe that friends or relatives have been in this area during the last weeks should go immediately to the Swiss emergency offices that have been opened up in Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich.
The tragedy has been heightened by the loss of 12,000 contestants in the cross-country marathon, which started an hour before the splinter hit.
The cameraman and crew who shot this film left the area by helicopter only minutes before the disaster.
In the minds of people everywhere, the question is, where next and what about the big one due on Sunday, closing on Earth at 30,000 miles an hour?
We can only hope, as the President of the United States has assured us, that we are in safe hands.
This is Osman Ragheb in Zurich, returning you to the ABC Studios in New York.
My God.
As simply as you can, Mr Sherwood., what's the procedure now?
The satellites are orbiting with Earth 22,500 miles out in space.
Since they are in different orbits, and in order for them to reach the target together, they will have to be fired at different times.
Peter the Great first, and then 40 minutes later, Hercules.
Two hours after that, they will explode at a designated distance from the target.
Can anything go wrong?
Well...
...once the rockets have been launched, they switch over to their own internal decision-making systems.
If these systems perform perfectly, there's no problem.
But if there's a malfunction...
What are the odds?
Mr President, you know we've never done this before.
The odds?
Your guess is as good as mine.
If you fail?
The meteor will hit Earth two hours later.
Hit It Mr Sherwood..
Get rid of it.
- What is it? What's happened?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing. I just wondered if you'd taken time to eat.
Yes, I, uh, had some coffe.
That will only make you nervous.
You will do better with food.
You're absolutely right
Let's go eat. That's a pretty scarf.
Thank you.
How many children do you have?
Two. A boy and a girl.
- How do you know I'm married?
- I asked Mr Sherwood..
He also told me that you and your wife are... separated?
I'll have a talk with Mr Sherwood..
I hope you don't mind that I asked him about you.
No. I would have asked Dr Dubov about you, but my Russian's limited.
- Like some coffe?
- No, thank you.
What else you want to know?
It would be too rude to ask.
Ask what you like.
Why are you and your wife separated?
Nothing specific.
It uh, just happened. It's, uh...
No more talks, no more interests together.
It's what we here in America call, uh, "incompatibility".
That's what we call it in Russia.
Yeah. That sounds about right.
- Ever thought of living elsewhere?
- No.
- Not often.
- Sometimes?
Well...
You'd like it here.
We've got everything.
Power cuts, strikes, unemployment, race riots and a terrific crime rate.
Yamashiro on the Hong Kong monitor reporting another splinter.
Yes, Clark?
We've just received a transmission from a TWA jet over the Pacific.
There was an explosion at sea, heavy enough to knock out two engines.
The plane's heading for Taiwan.
They've reported a tidal wave, 100 feet high, heading towards Hong Kong.
Radar contact with the wave establishes height stabilized at 100 feet
Speed is constant 600 mlles an hour.
Fifteen minutes before it hits us.
- Can you hear it?
- Yes! Get out of there.
It's no use. Get the big one, Paul.
Get it.
Fifteen minutes from now the Russian rockets will be launched.
Forty minutes after, our own rockets will be sent to join them.
They will strike the meteor, sending it into a harmless orbit nevermore to menace Earth.
It is Sunday.
Stay in your homes.
Have faith.
There is nothing we can do but wait
We will let you know when the danger has passed.
Launch director says go.
We've been cleared to launch.
- Clear...
- Roger... Standby for clear release.
Clear. Release on time.
You copy? Clear. Release was on?
- Autopilot light on.
- Thank you.
Thirty seconds and counting.
Twenty-five seconds.

Engines have started.
Ten seconds.
Seven, six, five, four... three...
Ignition. Blast-off!
No problems.
We are on our way.
Miss Donskaya?
Would you please be good enough to convey my congratulations to Dr Dubov?
My apologies, Bradley.
I was very wrong.
- If there's anything i can do...
- Thank you.
I'll be in my office if you need me.
Hercules launch minus three minutes.
All stations report on readiness.
Power operating at correct levels.
Engine parameters all OK.
Hercules targeted correctly...
Ground facilities have conformation Hercules has received and stored the launch command.
- Yes, Sir Michael?
- I've got some serious news.
- I'd like a word with Dr Bradley.
- Yes, sir.
Dr Bradley?
Sir Michael would like to talk to you.
We've picked up another splinter.
- A big one.
- Direction?
The United States.
- The eastern seaboard.
- You mean us?
- Near enough.
- Due when?
Just about now.
Can you advance Hercules?
No way.
Stand by.
Coming up on 90 seconds and counting. Stand by.
Mark, 90 seconds.
We wait
We don't fire, and we go out of action.
The Russian rockets aren't enough.
We wait
Clear. Release on time.
Copy?
Clear. Release was on time.
- 55 seconds.
- Thank you.
Auto pilot light on.
Forty seconds and counting.
Thirty seconds and counting.

Seven, six, five, four...
Ignition.
- God!
- Somebody help me.
Somebody help Manheim.
- You all right?
- I'm all right
But I..I think...
- Let's go.
- Don't worry.
- Help me, please.
- Take a look
This is Ops Chief Goldstone reporting to Houston.
Motor burns on all rocket engines for both satellites appear nominal.
Easton again. The situation is A-1.
All rockets functional.
66 minutes to impact.
We'll relay Information.
There's been no contact from New York.
Have you heard?
Nothing from the centre.
The rest of the city's in shambles.
No way.
Dr Bradley, could you come here, please?
Listen, everybody.
Listen carefully.
The exit from the canteen has been blocked.
We can get out through the support room.
We'll need flashlights.
You head up the lead.
I'll pick up the stragglers.
Everybody head for the subway tunnel.
Have you got batteries for the flashlight?
Here, take this one.
Just take this flashlight.
Come on.
The rest of you stay where you are.
Channel five of Peter the Great indicates number 4 and 7 rockets have malfunctioned.
Goldstone tracking reports
Peter the Great has lost two.
- How bad is that?
- There's a safety margin of five.
After the rockets join up, they'll attack the meteor in three waves.
Time to impact 35 minutes, 42 seconds.
- Can we go through?
- Yes.
It's OK but there's a subway car blocking the tunnel.
Get the others.
It'll be all right
Harry, the river's breaking through!
Through that car!
Hurry up!
This way, through the car!
Hurry up. Through the car.
Help!
That way!
Come on, come on!
Oh, my God.
It's no use. Get in.
You OK?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on. Fourteen minutes till impact
Fourteen minutes.
Ten degrees.
We're losing one from Hercules.
Time to impact?
Thirteen minutes, 29 seconds.
What was that?
He said one day you will come to Moscow and you will see a clean subway.
One day I'll take him up on that
How long?
Three minutes.
Two minutes, 50 seconds.
Tracking stations report no more loss.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Helicopters over the city report tremendous damage.
All local radio and television stations are not functioning.
Here at WADW in New Jersey, we'll keep you informed throughout the day.
Any second now.
We're interrupting our coverage to bring an announcement just received from Houston.
Three minutes ago at 10.38, the combined rockets of the United States and the USSR struck the meteor, which has for five days been coming towards us.
The danger is passed.
Quiet down, everybody.
Listen, listen.
With the compliments of the Dodgers.
Dodgers!
Baseball.
There's never a cop around when you need one.
How much?
Can't say I'm crazy about the paint job.
How long to get an order from the factory?
How much you give me in trade for my Ford?
Really? Thanks a lot, you cheating bastard.
Great show. Held over for a third straight year.
Marijuana!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome warmly...
Country Joe and the Fish.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We're certainly delighted to be here today.
We'd like to start off our portion of the show...
by giving you a taste of a little something we call rock and soul music.
This is really beautiful, man.
You have to realize the turnabout...
that I've gone through in the last three days.
Just to look, just to see, just to really realize...
what's really important.
The fact that if we can't all live together and be happy...
if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street...
if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody, right?
What kind of a way is that to go through this life?
They sure don't make pictures like that anymore.
There is no phone ringing, damn it!
There is no phone.
My God, it's almost dark.
They'll be waking up soon.
Penthouse, Robert, and hurry. Oui, oui, sir.
This is your commentator
Jonathan Matthias with another bulletin.
And now, as the Sino-Russian border war continues to rapidly escalate...
U.S. Authorities are beginning to question to what degree we will become involved... in what could swiftly grow into global conflict.
Abort firings! Interception will fragment the cilia-carrying missiles.
Repeat! Abort firings!
Interception will fragment the cilia-carrying missiles.
Hi.
Another day, another dollar.
Hi, big brother. How's your ass?
As for you, I think it's your move.
Join me?
Miserable schmuck.
Isn't he? Isn't he a sullen...
At it again, I see.
What'll it be tonight?
Museum of science? Some library?
Poor miserable bastards.
They almost got me tonight, you know that?
Neville, come out!
Shut up!
- Neville!
- Why the hell can't you leave me alone?
Three, brother? Are you sure?
- Not three.
- Three, brother.
Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door.
We heard the shooting. Then Joshua.
The light. They should have stayed clear of the light.
There was no light, brother. Just the fire.
- Nonsense. Neville can't see in the dark.
- Tell him that.
- Any more than we can see in the light.
- To hell he sees.
Good enough, he sees.
More! Burn it all!
One creature... caught in a place he cannot stir from in the dark.
Alone. Outnumbered, hundreds to one.
Nothing to live for but his memories.
Nothing to live with but his gadgets, his cars, his guns, gimmicks.
And yet the whole Family can't bring him down out of that...
That honky paradise, brother?
Forget the old ways, brother.
All your hatreds, all your pains.
Forget. And remember... the Family is one.
But him, that thing... that creature of the wheel...
that lord of the infernal engines and machines...
What day is it, anyway? Monday?
The hell it is. It's Sunday!
Sunday, I always dress for dinner.
Let me put the power to him, brother.
Just a little nitro.
I can get the cannons out of the old guard armory.
- We could have him out in no time.
- I said no.
We could, but then the curse would begin all over again.
- Don't you see?
- Yes, I see.
I see him living high in the light... while we rot and hide like grubs.
- What do you see, brother?
- He will be destroyed, brother. He will.
But not by guns, not by machines, not by the evil forbidden things... the tools that destroyed the world.
The world.
They destroyed the world.
The entire Los Angeles area.
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain...
and civil defense authorities state the situation is the same across the country.
Marshal law is now nationwide.
Major cities in all parts of the country:
New York, Los Angeles...
report plague victims falling dead in the streets, in their homes, at work.
The first symptom appears to be severe choking...
followed by immediate unconsciousness.
Death occurs within minutes.
Whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists... is not important any longer.
Our fellow countrymen are dying.
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble...
under the dread assault of that horror long feared: Germ warfare.
CONELRAD Channel.
This is a class-one emergency.
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
Stay in your homes.
Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution.
Stay in your homes.
Repeat. CONELRAD Channel.
This is a class-one emergency.
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.
Now the question is survival.
Is this the end of technological man?
Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of our fabled science...
the superhuman conquests of space and time, the age of the wheel?
We were warned of judgment.
Here it is. Here. Now.
In the form of billions of microscopic bacilli.
This is the end.
Neville.
I see.
Let's try the test vaccine.
93B-71.
How the hell do I know?
We'll find out.
All right, I'll be there in an hour.
Vaccine.
With fire, my brothers, we have purified all that lives with our zeal...
and we shall continue with our work.
With our devotion, we shall cleanse the world.
And Neville will come down, down to the Family into judgment... down to punishment for his blasphemies.
Here is the instrument of cleansing, my brethren.
And nothing quite cleanses like fire.
I was lucky today.
Believe me, I was lucky.
He tried a gambit... and it almost worked.
But it ended up a stalemate... with the Family down three pawns.
What do you think his next move will be?
End games are always full of surprises, aren't they?
My move.
Discovered check.
How does that grab you, Caesar?
Your move, lmperator.
Excuse me.
Did you move?
Balls.
You used to be a nice guy once, you know that?
And Speedy Bob Neville, his great legs churning... goes flashing across the finish line... with a 3-minute-and-50-second mile.
Go ahead. I wanna see some son of a bitch beat that.
This is recording 6306,
Rimini Boulevard, Sector 2.
Last five blocks have been clear... except for some signs they've been foraging for food... in a small grocery store... at 5500 block.
You'd think the prices would keep them in the supermarkets.
You gotta hand it to them.
They sure cover their tracks.
Two years.
If I could just find the nest, find out where they hole up.
Matthias!
All right, where's Matthias?
Come on. Where's Matthias?
Where's the hive?
Journal recording 958. August 5, 1977.
I found another one, one of Matthias' group, dead of plague.
The sweep continues.
Not my color.
Wait! Come back!
I want to talk to you!
Is this how it starts?
A trip to the laughing academy?
No, you silly bastard.
It starts with you asking yourself idiot questions.
Right.
Okay.
Let's get cleaned up... and find a drink before the bars close.
And, oh, brothers and sisters,
I ask you to look at him.
Does he have the marks?
Do you see them?
You see him, as we were before the punishment... before we gained grace.
You see lying there the last of scientists, of bankers, of businessmen... the users of the wheel.
Do we use the tools of the wheel as he does?
- Is he of the Family?
- No.
Is he of the sacred society?
- Then what is he?
- Evil.
He is part of the dead.
He has no place here.
He has the stink of oil and electrical circuitry about him.
He is obsolete.
You are discarded.
You are the refuse of the past.
You're full of crap.
How hard it is to admit the truth.
Take him to the little room for the questioning.
Mr. Neville, now we can talk a little while.
It's been a long time since you've talked, except to yourself.
Tell me something, would you?
Are you fellas really with the Internal Revenue Service?
Your little jokes are meaningless, Mr. Neville.
Or doctor, or colonel, or whatever it was they called you.
- I'm a scientist. What the hell are you?
- Definition of a scientist:
A man who understood nothing, until there was nothing left to understand.
So there is a little light in the forest after all.
A guiding light, Mr. Neville.
Now to me has passed the responsibility... for this last tiny remnant of mankind.
Then why don't you quit these bloody games?
Throw away those Halloween costumes, and get these people organized, damn it.
Or are you already too far gone?
- A long road of truth...
- For God's sake.
And we are very organized, Mr. Neville.
After last night, you should know that.
If you're organized, why don't you try finding a cure?
There is none!
There was no cure, and there is no cure... but the Family has found its way.
We can bear it.
The only burden left is you.
But you've been trying to kill me for two years.
Last night you killed how many?
Three of us?
And today, we don't know yet.
You're the angel of death, Doctor, not us.
He has confessed all, brothers.
Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of prescribed rites.
He admits science, medicine, weapons, machinery, electricity.
He has not shared the punishments.
He does not bear the marks.
Marks?
Show him, my children.
Show him the pretty marks.
These are the marks, Mr. Neville.
The punishment which you and those like you brought upon us.
In the beginning we tried to help one another, those that were left.
We tried to clean things up, set things straight.
We buried things and burned.
Then it came to me that we were chosen...
Chosen for just this work.
To bury what was dead, to burn what was evil... to destroy what was dangerous.
You're barbarians.
Barbarians?
You call us barbarian?
This is an honorable name.
We mean to cancel the world you civilized people made.
We will erase history from the time... that machinery and weapons threatened more than they offered.
And when you die... the last living reminder of hell will be gone.
Gone.
Brother Zachary.
We are ready, brother.
- Here is evil.
- Evil.
Is this not the place where all the dead were burned?
And this is the last of the dead.
And what shall we do with him, my brethren?
Burn.
- The dark!
- Turn off the light!
Get those lights out!
Give us the dark!
Bring back the dark!
Who the hell are you?
Shut up.
He's gone!
Find him. That's an order!
- Find him!
- Go, man, go!
Move!
You son of a bitch, just hold tight.
Up against the wall, you mother.
Don't turn. Just stand.
I'll turn you when I want.
On or off, up or around, I'll turn you.
Now cool it!
Now, put your hands out.
Way out about shoulder high, like they're gonna crucify you, baby.
Matter of fact, they were gonna roast me.
Why'd you stop 'em?
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
You got any more questions, fathead?
My name is Robert.
Your name's mud.
Down the tunnel!
After him!
Back!
Okay, hold it. Open it up.
- You. You're the...
- Your living Playtex doll.
Now, come on, man. Get the bike.
Move! Pull it out!
- You really plan ahead.
- It helps.
Now look, you gotta run this thing, you understand, but I'm the ramrod.
Those stadium lights, how'd you manage that?
- Dutch knows all about that stuff.
- Dutch?
Come on, man. Get on the bike.
Don't screw up. I know how to roll, but it's hard on the elbows.
And if you just have to play James Bond...
I'll bust your ass.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't let him get away!
Goddamn it, left, and step on it!
Move! Down the tunnel, man.
Hit it. They're blinded.
Okay, baby. Hitch up your drawers.
- I thought we'd gotten past that.
- You're sweet.
It's okay, Tommy.
This is the man, and I mean the man.
But he's cool. It's okay.
Come on, man.
This is it. That's all there is.
At least all we know of.
There are others, I guess, if Matthias and his brethren haven't killed them all.
I didn't know there were any left.
Between the Family at night and you in the daytime... shooting at anything that moved, man, we had to stay low.
I had to stay alive.
The mad bomber himself.
And I see you got the mad scientist.
- You know me?
- And about your work.
My work?
Biowar pathology perimeters in urban and semi-urban environments.
Journal of Military Medicine, June, 1974.
Incremental effects, countermeasures to toxic agents, and liquid systems delivery.
Microbiological Letters,
January, 1975. Remember?
That's a nice recitation.
You know what it means?
I was a med school senior when they scratched the world.
As a matter of fact, I was gonna apply to Biowar Labs for my post-doc...
- but the next term never came.
- Sorry you didn't make it.
Sorry the world didn't make it.
Come on. Let's go see about Richie.
Lisa's brother. He looks like he's about to go over.
You've only seen the tertiary cases,
Matthias and his people.
We're not that far gone, but we're on the road.
The yellow brick road.
We're off to see the wizard.
When it hit, the older people either died or went to the third stage fast... you know, blindness in light, albinism... psychotic illusions, occasional stages of torpor, like Matthias and the things there.
- What about you? Why didn't you get it?
- I don't know.
Some of the younger people have a kind of... resistance.
I don't know, we just hold out.
Some of us are a bit light-sensitive, otherwise, we're all right.
But Richie's definitely going.
He's advanced secondary. Incidentally... mind telling me what keeps you in the city?
You some kind of exterminator?
I guess maybe you could call it that.
Very complicated, Doctor.
I'd be living on top of City Hall, or better, the Oxy Tower... instead of that pillbox you're in.
That's where I live.
It's where I used to live.
It's where I'm going to live, and not Matthias nor his Family... nor any other son of a bitch is going to make me leave.
He's no better.
His fever is high.
- What are you...
- Shut up.
Keep out of the way.
Sit down.
Could stay this way for weeks, or he'll go over 10 minutes from now.
I've seen them go before.
I almost got killed by a friend of mine last summer.
He went over without any warning.
When I looked away... his face was pale and his hair was going.
When I looked back... he didn't have any eyes.
What did you do?
I did just like you'd do, Doctor. I killed him.
If the Masonic rites are over.
How about Richie?
We'll take him to my place.
I got nearly everything I need there.
Is there anything you can do, Doctor?
I mean, seeing how you've lost over 200 million patients.
I don't have it.
Have what?
The plague. I'm immune.
- Everybody has it.
- Everybody but me.
There was a vaccine, just an experimental batch.
We weren't sure it would work.
- Why, if you're immune, you could...
- That's right.
My blood might be a serum.
At the stage that boy's in, my antibodies could reverse the whole process. Stop it.
Christ, you could save the world.
Screw the world. Let's save Richie.
Nothing with drugs.
It's got to be the serum.
Couldn't you reconstitute the vaccine?
You got any idea how many steps it takes... to synthesize an antibiotic specific for this bug?
- Got the picture.
- I've tried. God knows I've tried.
Once I caught one of Matthias' people last year...
and tried everything on the shelves on him.
He damn near killed me...
and then he died very badly himself.
So it's very tight, Doctor.
Very tight.
Bring him in here.
In the bed.
I see where you do your heavy thinking.
One side keeps the other side going.
Can't have one without the other.
- I'm a narcissist.
- How do you do?
- The guest room.
- You weren't expecting us?
I wasn't expecting you.
Hold these.
I'm gonna need some help.
Lisa will have to do.
I hate to leave the kids alone too long.
They get spooked.
Watch your mouth.
Some of the kids, you know what they say?
What do some of the kids say?
They say the Family comes in the night when it's dark.
They say they're going to come some night and take Richie's soul... and tie it all up in a bag and give it to the devil.
Is that really true?
Do you know if that's really true?
We wouldn't let that happen.
Not a chance.
Are you God?
Let's find out if he's a doctor first before we go promoting him, okay?
Okay.
How about a break?
Your move.
I just made my move.
Where'd you get that dress?
The same place you got that jacket.
I hustled it.
The house fuzz was on vacation.
Neville.
His voice...
I'll never get used to it... to hearing it.
Something...
We were with them for a while, you know?
With Matthias?
You were a part of that Family?
When it happened, when even the army fell apart... and there was nobody left except those living alone like animals...
Matthias walked the streets at night... ringing a bell.
Richie and I, we had us a place in the back of a furniture store.
One day, we hear this bell.
So we go out to see, and there are people there.
We thought we were alone... just me and Richie with millions of corpses.
But there was Matthias and other people.
Anyway, he gave us the Family for a while.
We helped with the burials.
We helped with the burnings.
But when it was over, and the worst was past... they began to know how different we were, our skin, our eyes.
One day while they were asleep, we just took off.
How'd you get mixed up with Dutch and his group?
Dutch came by one day and said he was with the census bureau.
Now, what are you thinking?
You know the old song?
"If you were the only girl in the world and I were the only boy"? Okay... but until then don't bother me.
I guess I'm the only boy.
The Family.
I forgot to keep the fuel up in the generator.
They'll be into the garage!
You stay here.
- What's this for?
- Comfort.
You may not have time.
More time than Neville has, brother.
- When he comes back, I'll be waiting...
- Take care.
- He has the luck of a devil.
- I know.
But this time his luck has run out.
You can take down that service flag now, mother.
Man, don't scare me like that.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
What's this stuff about me being the only girl in the world?
Do you know it's been a long time?
I'm not sure I remember how this goes.
- How is he?
- He's stable.
No loss of pigment since yesterday and vital signs are steady.
He's comfortable.
I'm sorry.
It's been a long time since I've had a patient.
Doctor, you certainly haven't lost your bedside manner.
Is that so?
Are you ready for this?
What is it?
Birth control pills.
Yeah.
Here we are.
I can make toxins from both of these.
All right, now the tourniquet.
Good and tight.
That's fine.
Give me the swab.
All right, you get the needle.
Go ahead.
All right, take off the tourniquet.
Will one bottle be enough?
It's genuine 160-proof old Anglo-Saxon, baby.
I was a very peculiar doctor in those days... trying to find treatments for diseases that hadn't existed... till other doctors invented them.
Now I'm the only game in town.
I don't know how much.
I'll draw blood as often as I can.
We'll just have to keep pumping it into him.
- How long do you think it'll take?
- I don't know.
I really don't know.
But if it does work... then Richie will be the source of even more antibodies.
The more people we inject... the more serum we'll get.
And when that's done...
When that's done, baby, we will pull out.
We'll take what we need and head for the mountains.
Out of "rats' alley where the dead men lost their bones."
T.S. Eliot turns out to have been just as good a prophet as he was a poet.
The Waste Land.
I wonder if it comforts him.
I wonder if I'll ever see a stream full of fish again.
Where'd you ever see a stream full of fish in Harlem?
At the movies.
- Does that hurt?
- A little, yeah.
It hurts. How about off, man? Turn it off.
A week ago, that much light would have sent you right up the wall.
I'm beginning to see the light.
I'll have another batch of serum ready in a few hours... then we'll load up that Land Rover, pick up Dutch and the kids... and head for the hills.
How about the Sierras?
Yeah.
Baby, we made it. We really made it.
I think I'll go pick up some stuff for the trip.
Is there anything special you fancy, baby?
What I pick up today, you're going to be seeing for a long time.
- Why don't you skip it?
- Honey.
The most dangerous thing I ever ran into in one of those stores was you.
You watch yourself.
You stay on the ground floors, near the doors, and in the light.
- If you see anything, shoot.
- Check.
Honey, can I borrow your credit cards?
Is that gonna be for me?
You don't need any more.
This is for Lisa.
- One of these days, she may...
- Start to turn?
That's always a possibility.
It's best to catch these things early.
Then you don't think the serum would work... for tertiary cases?
- What do you mean?
- Like Matthias.
The Family.
It's hard to say.
Would it?
Come on, help me with this.
Put the cap on that.
Put it in the refrigerator.
I can't afford to give more blood till I get clear of this town.
Later on, if your blood count comes up... and you put on some weight, we can use your blood to make serum.
Yeah?
Yeah. Now, go eat your soup.
Someone ought to do something about those people.
How about it?
- You gonna give them the serum?
- Fat chance.
How come?
We'd have to be here for a few more months, for one thing.
For another thing, they're homicidal maniacs, for God's sake.
Man, they're humans.
I mean, they're sick, you know?
They're vermin.
Okay, then.
If you don't want to cure them, kill them.
If I just knew where they're at.
The old court building, that's where.
In the Civic Center.
That's where they're holed up.
- You're kidding me.
- They're there.
Go on. Ain't you gonna go down there and zap them?
Why not?
You've been looking to kill them for practically two whole years now.
Either kill them or cure them, damn it.
No need.
They're half-dead right now.
You know what, mister?
You're hostile.
You just don't belong.
Nice of you to let me hang around.
At times, you scare me more than Matthias does.
- How's Richie?
- Beautiful. It works.
It works.
My God, it's a beautiful world!
Don't you think we ought to do something?
Damn right.
I've got some blood to make up serum for Lisa.
We'll start on the rest of you in a week or so.
Can you have the kids ready to leave tomorrow?
Gonna take me a little ride in the sun.
Where are we going?
Away, that's all. Just away.
Someplace nobody ever bothered with.
A river nobody ever dammed... a mountain nobody built any bloody freeways to... where everything we do will be the first time it happened.
You got it. That's it. Just like in the beginning of the world.
Like we were starting all over again in the Garden of Eden!
Only this time, we don't trust no frigging snake!
Scout, I wonder if we're gonna have room for you.
"Going to find out who's right.
"You or me."
- Why are you here?
- I came to help you.
- You know the man.
- Neville?
That's him.
He's got a serum for what's wrong with you.
And if you could just talk to him, get with him...
then everybody could be...
Yes? Everybody could be what?
Everyone...
Everybody could be normal again.
I see.
- We could be as we were before?
- I guess so.
- The way we were.
- The way we were.
That's what Neville thinks we want?
Is that why he sent you?
- He didn't send me. He...
- Silence!
He sent you to offer us something from his world... to change us back to the creatures we were. A trick!
A trick to weaken our resolve.
I was almost like you, but he saved me.
He brought me back.
He wants us all to go away from here.
You have been damned, Richard.
Don't you see that? Don't you?
Prepare the Family.
Tonight...
I think Neville might come out.
The Family is one.
The Family is all.
We have cleansed the world.
Outside the Family, there is nothing at all.
The Family.
Oh, my God.
Yes, Robert?
About Richie...
I know.
You know?
Matthias told me.
It was necessary.
My God.
Come in.
Sounds strange, doesn't it?
"Come in, Neville."
I thought we might arrange a little entertainment for you... before time for concluding our little business.
My brothers.
We waited for you, Neville... so you could see this, the end.
The end of all you've done.
You see, none of it was real.
It was illusion. Your art, your science.
It was all a nightmare, and now it's done.
Finished.
My brethren... our task is nearly complete.
He was the last of those who brought the punishment to us.
We have cleansed and purged his world.
Now we must build.
Build coffins. That's all you'll need.
Bring him.
All right, stand back!
Back up!
Stop him! Don't let them get away!
It's 10 minutes to sunup.
We'll have to chance it.
- I want...
- Damn it, it's jammed.
I want you.
For God's sake, come back in the light.
The bad dream is over, friend Neville.
Now we can sleep in peace.
Robert, you're evil.
I'm part of the Family.
I'm sorry.
The Family.
You don't understand.
Put her in the truck.
Let's move, kids. We got a long way to go.

Hi. Ed Ramsey from Delos.
If there's anyone who doesn't know what Delos is, well, as we've always said...
...Delos is the vacation of the future, today.
At Delos you get your choice of the vacation you want.
There's Medieval World, Roman World and, of course, Westworld.
Let's talk to some people who've been there.
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?
Gardner Lewis.
Just got back from Westworld.
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.
When you played cowboys and Indians as a kid, you'd point...
...go "bang, bang" and the other kid would lie down and play dead.
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only... only it's for real!
I shot six people!
Well, they weren't real people!
What Mr. Lewis means is he shot six robots...
...scientifically programmed to look, act, talk and even bleed just like humans do.
Isn't that right?
Well, they may have been robots.
I mean, I think they were robots.
I mean, I know they were robots!
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there to serve you...
...and to give you the most unique vacation experience of your life.
Thank you, sir.
And you, madam?
Hello.
What is your name?
My name is Janet Lane, and I was in Roman World.
What is the one thing that stands out in your mind about Roman World?
Oh, well, I think it would be...
...the men!
I just feel marvelous! I mean...
...it's just a warm, glowing place to be!
Thank you very much.
Oh, thank you very much!
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- And you, sir?
- Yeah?
What is your name, sir?
Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.
And, which world did you just come from, sir?
Oh, you're not going to believe this!
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld for the last two weeks!
Did it seem real to you, sir?
It's the realest thing I've ever done!
I mean that!
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.
And you, sir?
My name's Arthur Caine.
I've been in the castle.
I've had a couple of sword fights and three jousts.
And I...
I married a beautiful princess.
Is that something you've always dreamed of doing, sir?
All my life!
There were some of the comments of people who've just returned from Delos.
Why don't you arrange...
...to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World,
Roman World and Westworld?
Was it worth $1,000 a day?
Yes!
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
You are cleared on Vector 79, on 195...
We anticipate scanning in about four and a half minutes.
I'm not worried at all. I'm just...
I'm just curious.
How much do they weigh?
Three or four pounds.
That heavy.
Do they have much of a kick?
A Colt.45?
Well, I never fired one before.
What about that thing where you go like this over the gun?
- Fanning?
- Yeah.
- What about it?
- Is that hard to do?
Now...
The gunbelt, does it have those strings to tie around your leg?
If that's the kind you want.
That's the kind I want. I think it's probably better for quick draws, you know.
It all depends.
What kind of gunbelt did you have the last time?
I had the one without the strings.
And you could draw fast?
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all.
The guns they give you are real guns?
Real guns.
That's incredible.
Give us a shift to 197...
...and take it down to Port 43.
Negative acceleration at 22.
So long as you maintain passenger comfort.
Sigma-sigma was transferred according to the log at 041.
The orientation on the resort will now begin.
Please put on your earphones.
Don't you want to listen?
I heard it the last time.
...consists of three separate resort areas, each with its own special appeal.
Whichever resort you have chosen...
...we are sure you will have a fascinating and rewarding stay here.
Western World is a complete re-creation of the American frontier of 1880.
Here it is possible to relive the excitement and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.
Western World is a life of lawless violence, a society of guns and action.
This is Medieval World, where we have reconstructed 13th-century Europe.
A world of chivalry and combat, romance and excitement.
Our teams of engineers have spared no expense in this re-creation...
...precise to the smallest detail.
Then we have Roman World:
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting of delightful, decadent Pompeii.
Here the traveler experiences the sensual, relaxed morality that existed at the peak...
...of the Imperial Roman Empire.
All together, these resorts comprise Delos...
...the most exciting vacation spot in the history of man.
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
Your negative deceleration should be 25...
...and your ground speed should be
355 and dropping.
The whole spectrum of technology has been employed in Delos...
...for the vacationer's pleasure.
Expensive and unusual,
Delos is not for everyone.
But for those who choose it, it is truly a unique and rewarding experience.
We have you on Grid 5.
Notify ground crews.
Stand by. Locking in now.
Shut down 2, shut down 3.
Shut down 2, shut down 3.
Nice job, everybody.
Welcome to Delos.
Please go to your color-coded tram...
...which will take you to the world of your choice.
Give your name to the attendant.
Welcome to Delos.
Please go to your color-coded tram...
...which will take you to the world of your choice.
May I have your name, please?
John Blane.
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.
Please go to your color-coded tram which will take you...
...to the world of your choice.
We are sure you will enjoy your stay in Western World.
Was she a...?
Probably.
That's amazing!
Supposedly, you really can't tell... except by looking at the hands.
They haven't perfected the hands yet.
Nothing can go wrong.
You will enjoy your stay in Roman World.
While you are there, please feel free to indulge your every whim.
Medieval World exists for you, the guest.
Nothing can go wrong.
I have a quick fade on the CRT and my balance controls don't seem to help me.
I'm keeping this in real time.
Switch me over to an on-line status and I'll do it manually.
You've got a three-millisecond cycle delay which should be computed in.
I don't know what to do if the stagecoach is late.
Oh! It's fantastic!
I reckon that's everything.
Bath's down the hall.
Bath'll cost you two bits for hot water.
Dinner at 7:00, breakfast at 6:30.
Get lunch on your own.
Couple of places in town to eat.
Don't look like much here, but we have everything.
Just a minute.
You mean to tell me he's a robot?
That's what I mean to tell you.
We're paying $1,000 a day for this?
It's authentic.
The West of the 1880s.
Well, at least they could've made it a little more comfortable.
But that's the point.
This is really the way it was.
If you wanted comfort, you should have stayed in Chicago.
Julie would have loved all this!
Poking around for hours in all those funny shops, looking for silly...
What the hell is wrong with you?
You're a lawyer!
You know better than anybody else what a ride she took you for.
Well, the kids...
Fine, the kids!
But you're here, six months later, still thinking about her.
No, not really.
She just came to mind, is all.
There's a lot to do here.
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.
What about you?
Vodka martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.
Just give him whiskey.
He's new in town.
You've got to get into the feel of the thing.
I feel silly.
Why?
It's like a joke.
It's not a joke, it's an amusement park.
It's the best amusement park in the world.
All you have to do is have fun.
There's some pretty rough-looking customers here.
How many of them are...?
Guests like us?
Who knows?
That's the beauty of this place.
It doesn't matter.
It may look rough, but it's still just a resort.
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.
What is this stuff?
It doesn't say.
God! Give me this!
Puts hair on your chest.
Yeah.
Sloppy with your drink.
Get this boy a bib.
Go on!
He needs his momma.
Kill him.
You talk too much.
You say something, boy?
I said, you talk too much.
Why don't you make me shut up?
Your move.
Pretty realistic, huh?
Listen, are you sure he was a...?
Of course. You don't really think you shot anybody, do you?
Wow!
Hey, John...
How do I know I'm not going to kill another guest with this thing?
Try it.
Shoot me.
Go on, shoot.
Shoot!
The gun has a sensing device.
It won't fire at anything with a high body temperature.
Only something cold, like a machine.
They thought of everything.
The Black Knight won't be repaired till tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled for 5:30, if that conforms.
What do folks do for companionly entertainment in this town?
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just runnin' this hotel.
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon down at the end of the street.
Now, I won't have talk of that woman in this house.
Not over my dinner.
The food's real good, ma'am.
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.
Isn't she terrific?
Who's Miss Carrie?
You fellas new in town?
Yep.
Whiskey.
Just passin' through?
Maybe.
Lookin' for some fun?
Maybe.
Well, you've come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.
That's Cindy and Arlette.
Arlette's from Paris.
Perhaps you gentlemen are taking a likin' to 'em.
Perhaps.
They're real accommodatin'.
- They look it.
- Listen...
Why don't you just go on upstairs and we'll reckon accounts later?
- Sounds good to me.
- Are those two girls machines?
Now, how can you say a thing like that?
Come on.
What's goin' on?
They're robbin' the bank.
Robbin' the bank?
Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.
You don't know.
It might be fun to play bank robbers.
Look, Pete, this is better.
There...
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...
...but it matters to me.
I haven't ever had a...
Well, I hardly know you, if you know what I mean. I mean...
We just met a few minutes ago.
You're probably very nice.
I feel funny.
Why?
I think you're very nice.
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?
Boy, machines are the servant of man!
Wasn't that great?
Not bad.
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!
Well, you know how it is.
Some guys have a way with women.
Shooting stopped.
I guess we missed the robbery.
You can't have everything.
John...
...this place is really fun!
I think it's the jugular unit.
- What do you think?
- Should we try and rewire her?
No, I'd replace the whole unit rather than try and repair it.
With a 10?
Use an XX-50 if we have any in stock.
The double X's have a longer lifespan.
A 50 may not fit in here.
Maybe you can shift the integrator unit further up into the cavity.
I'll try it.
Balance servo again?
Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.
I think it's the sensor.
If it's the central unit we'll open her up.
You get a confirmation before you do that.
What's he in for?
Central malfunction.
Another one?
Since we opened the resort, we had a failure and breakdown rate...
...conforming to computer predictions.
That is 0.3 malfunctions for each 24-hour activation period...
...concurrent or not.
Now, this was an anticipated operations aspect of the resort...
...and we were fully able to handle it.
The majority of the breakdowns were minor or peripheral...
...until about six weeks ago.
Then Roman World had a rise in breakdown rate...
...which doubled in a week.
In addition, we saw a disproportionate rise...
...in central as opposed to peripheral breakdowns.
Now, we identified some problems with humidity control...
...and regained homeostasis.
Despite our corrections, the breakdown rate continued to climb.
Then Medieval World began to have trouble.
Now we're seeing more Western World breakdowns.
And there's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy...
...to an infectious disease process spreading from one resort area to the next.
Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease.
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.
I must confess,
I find it difficult to believe in...
...a disease of machinery.
We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here.
These are highly complicated pieces of equipment...
...almost as complicated as living organisms.
In some cases, they've been designed by other computers.
We don't know exactly how they work.
Okay, up gain 437...
I'm not getting sound pickup from the tenth quadrant.
Okay, my telemetry is good.
Repeat, I have good telemetry.
We have sunrise at 0.43.
Ready on all quadrants.
Energize grid.
Grid energized.
All right, then give me a 436, if you can patch that in.
If not, 435.
I have sound now. Thank you very much.
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon and cinnamon toast.
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?
Okay, send it down to Central Control Room, Console 3.
Wait a minute.
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.
Hold on a minute.
All right, let's stand by for resort activation.
You ready on Phase 443?
Okay, we're going to activate at 59...
Lower gain Alpha 2...
Ready on six, on five, on four...
...on three, on two. Activate now.
"Oh, give me a home
"Where the buffalo roam
"And the deer and the antelope play
"Where seldom is heard
"A discouraging word
"And the skies are not cloudy all day"
What do you want?
"Home, home on the range"
Not one word.
Do you mind if I finish shaving?
Have you no sense of...
Was he bothering you?
He isn't gonna bother you again.
I'm here to tell you that things have changed.
There's law here now.
You can't go around plugging whoever you please.
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.
That's what they all say.
He shot a man.
He'll have to stand trial.
Judge'll be here next week.
If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.
Judge Benson likes to hang 'em.
Hang 'em high.
Look, Sheriff...
Beat it.
I said, beat it!
I've never been in jail before.
First time for everything.
But I haven't done anything wrong.
You shot a man. That's something.
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.
Well, Chicago's a long way from here, fella.
A thousand miles and more.
Hold it!
I guess that sort of makes us desperados.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, what do we do now?
The way I figure it, anything we want.
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.
We go in there, and we do anything we want!
You know what?
What?
I almost believe all this.
Why shouldn't you believe it?
It's as real as anything else.
Yep.
I reckon.
What can you give me in Grid 7?
We have that on SM-514.
Transfer, now.
Transferred.
Reschedule.
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.
Can't disappoint a guest.
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row that I've called you about my laundry.
You've got all my shirts...
We're rechecking the tapes on the mechanism now.
We have programmed infidelity in the queen...
...as of two minutes ago.
All right, coming up on the castle, zero...
Now.
It also conforms with your five-year history at this time of the year.
Leave me now.
My queen!
If the king should hear of this, we would both be put to death!
I would be more than happy to die for you, my lady.
Let us pray it shall not be so.
I have news.
The Black Knight has returned, and seeks a match with you.
The Black Knight...?
None other.
Is he pretty tough?
He has the strength of ten, and cunning besides.
But...
...his sight is weak in his left eye.
Stay to his left and you will prevail and win the day.
Confirmation of the reprogramming of that Black Knight...
...for left lateral weakness and instability for tomorrow.
I shall see you on the morrow?
My lady.
Schedule for tomorrow a.m.
It's his last day in the resort.
Let's make it a lulu.
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords.
Schedule locked.
We have a problem with the air conditioning in Beta section.
Send a crew out.
Yes! He can be sheriff any time he wants.
That is correct.
Just give him the badge.
Now, I'm the new law around here.
You think you can handle things?
You wanna try me?
A thousand pardons, my lord.
What is your name, child?
Daphne.
Daphne.
Oh, I love this place.
I love my horse.
I love my horse and I love Julie.
Oh, shut up, will you?
I like the spots on my horse.
- Did you see the spots on my horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.
- Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
- Thank you.
Look out!
Let me handle this!
Goddamn it!
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no!
That's not supposed to happen!
Maybe it is!
Maybe it's part of the thing!
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!
A rattlesnake struck a guest?
He was shooting at it and he missed.
The snakes are programmed never to hit on a strike.
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.
Pick up that snake for a total post at once.
Check all the snake's central mechanisms tonight during the repair period.
Doesn't anything work around here?
Logic circuits on the snake simply failed to respond.
There was no sign of mechanical damage or tampering...
...and no clue to the malfunction.
Central mechanism psychosis?
I feel we should shut down the resort for a month.
Oh, that seems rash.
A snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.
Many elements of the Delos Resort are potentially dangerous.
That's part of the appeal.
But if they become truly dangerous...
I agree.
We can announce that the resort is overbooked...
...and not allow any further new guests to arrive.
We can take care of the ones already here.
If we can't insure the safety of the guests, we'll be in desperate trouble.
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.
All right, let's start that bar fight.
Cheat!
John, what do you say?
Hit me.
Now, that's just rude!
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!
What's his problem?
Nothing. He got shot up today, so we're taking the opportunity...
...to replace the visual cortex.
Using the new infrared units.
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.
You called for me, my lord?
Yes.
How long have you been in the palace, Daphne?
Since I was three, my lord.
Charming.
I think we ought to get to know each other better, Daphne.
Better, my lord?
I can reward you well.
My lord...
Daphne...
My lord!
Daphne...
My lord forgets himself!
Problem with the girl.
Program breakdown.
What's the trouble?
One of the castle machines isn't responding.
Refusing a guest seduction.
Get her out of there, and report it to central repair.
Right.
Refusing...?
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.
But she wasn't following programming.
She refused a guest seduction and she is a sex model.
Certainly is.
Will they shut down?
No, the directors feel that to close down now would hurt tourist confidence.
I don't like it.
Breakfast.
I'm never gonna drink again.
Okay, 437...
I'm not getting sound pickup in the tenth quadrant.
Please set numbers to console...
Hold, varlet!
Are you speaking to me?
None other, sire.
Look, I'm hungry and I...
Prepare for thy doom, thy scurrilous knave! Huh!
Wait a minute! Can't we talk this over?
What, have you no spine, varlet?
Well, I...
The queen!
Full monitor.
Okay.
Let him go.
Oh, what a hangover.
All right, varlet!
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.
Shut down! Shut down immediately!
Circuits don't respond, sir!
Then cut the robot power!
Power cut!
Oh, my head!
I'm freezing!
Gotta get to the hotel.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
- They're not responding!
- Shall we cut the main power grid, sir?
Shut it all down! Shut it all down!
Hold it!
Come on, not now.
Not you again.
It's too early.
Let me do it this time.
Your move.
I'm shot.
What?
I'm shot!
John...?
Oh, my God!
Draw.
Sir, we have no control over the robots at all!
- They're running on stored charge!
- How long can they go?
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12!
- Turn the main grid back on!
- The relays must be frozen.
We can't get back our power!
Hello? Hello?
Now, how are we going to get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.
Now, get these doors open in here before we all suffocate!
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.
Get that power on so we can open these doors.
Hey!
Don't shoot me!
Hey, wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?
Hold out your hands.
Let me see your hands!
You're a guest!
You really gave me a scare.
Look, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.
You know about the machines?
Yeah, I repair 'em.
There's one chasing me now.
A gunslinger.
Gunslinger.
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.
If he's a 406, he's got all the sensory equipment.
It's a beautiful machine!
He's after me!
I don't doubt it.
What can I do?
There's nothing you can do.
He'll get you.
You haven't got a chance.
There must be something!
Fella, don't kid yourself.
There are things you could try:
Acid for his visual system, noise for his hearing...
No matter what, he'll always be one jump ahead of you!
You haven't got a chance!
Yes, I do.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
All right. It's all right.
- It's okay.
- Help me!
All right, all right.
- Help me!
- You're gonna be all right.
Help me!
No water...
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water...
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No!
Why don't you make arrangements to take our Hovercraft...
...to Medieval World, Roman World and Westworld.
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you, vacation for you...
...for you, for you, for you...
Oh, baby.
Tommy.
Tommy.
Mmm. That was great, baby.
Jody.
- Hi, Reg.
- How's it goin'?
Tommy's gone.
It's, uh... it's a hell of a way to end a trio.
It's hard to believe... he killed himself.
Yeah, I, uh... I'm gonna go visit somebody.
I'll catch ya inside.
Yeah.
The funeral is about to begin... sir.
Okay.
Sir.
It was a good idea not to let your little brother come to the funeral and see Tommy like this.
Yeah, after Mom and Dad's funeral, he had nightmares for weeks.
And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Hey, I don't like this place.
Well, say goodbye to Tommy.
Let's just get the hell out of here.
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi. Uh... is your grandmother home?
Sure. Come in.
Grandmother. Michael has returned and wishes to speak with you.
Grandmother is pleased you've come and wants to know what's bothering you.
Uh, tell her that I, um...
She can hear you.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, it's Jody again.
I found out that he's leaving.
I think it's one of these headers in here.
Hey, Toby! Hey.
- So what brings you back?
- Tommy.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I just don't get off on funerals, man.
They give me the creeps.
I just wanted to tell you I heard about your folks. I'm really sorry.
Yeah, thank you, man. That's, uh...
In two years I guess you can just about get over anything.
- So I hear you've been out on the road.
- Yeah.
How come you're hanging around this dump?
Well, I'm taking care of the kid, you know.
Shit, I think after, uh, all that action, this town would drive you nuts.
You're damn right. Hell, the kid's 13 now.
Yeah, I'm thinking of sending him off to live with his aunt.
But I'll tell you, he sure ain't gonna like it.
I mean, as it is, he follows me everywhere.
It's like he knows I'm gonna leave.
He's a tough little kid. I love him.
I'm gonna miss him.
Grandmother has told you before not to worry.
If he does leave, he'll take you with him.
- God, I hope she's right.
- She always is.
Uh, there's something else.
I'm really scared about something that I did.
I was messing around up at Morningside
Cemetery, and I saw something.
Something really scary.
Michael, grandmother wants to play a little game.
Wow! How'd you do that?
Put your hand in the box.
- Well, what's in it?
- Just put your hand in the black box.
Okay, but what's in it?
Hey, this thing really hurts!
Don't fear, Michael.
- I can't get my hand out.
- Don't fear.
- Give me back my hand!
- Don't fear!
It was simply reflection.
Fear is the killer.
That's what grandmother wants you to learn.
Boy, that really hurt.
It was all in your mind.
Oh, yeah.
Come and visit us again soon.
Yeah.
- Hiya, Reg.
- Writing a new tune?
Yeah, working on it.
# I'm just a-sittin' here at midnight #
# And I'll be sitting here 'til noon #
# You see, my lady left me lonely #
# Yes, she did #
# My baby left me blue #
All right. We're hot as love, you know.
Well, let's see.
This is, uh... just right up the street.
This is, uh...
- kinda spooky, isn't it?
- No, it's exciting.
So, uh... what's the only thing to do in this town?
Well, it's something...
Wow.
Wow.
What the heck?
Wait here. It's my little brother.
I think he's got some kind of a problem.
Mike!
What's wrong with you, man?
There's something up there.
I know it. I saw it!
What?
Okay, look, I was following you guys.
I didn't mean any harm, but it's out there and it's gonna get me!
- What's out there?
- I don't know.
It was little and brown and low to the ground.
It was probably just a gopher in heat.
It wasn't any gopher!
Where's that girl, anyway?
Well, she's waiting back there for me, you idiot.
Did you hear that?
Eh, it's only the wind.
You better go get her before it gets her.
You got some kind of an overactive imagination or something, man?
Look, tell you what.
You go on home.
I'll talk to you when I get back.
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Ah, get out of here.
Did that chick that I left with last night ever come back in here?
What happened? You get a hold of something you couldn't handle?
Nah, she just ditched out on me, I guess.
We were... messing around out there at Morningside.
- The funeral parlor?
- Yeah. Cemetery.
Jody? Is that you?
You hit my fucking foot, man.
Oh, damn. I know you're not gonna believe this, but these things were here.
Right in the garage and they were gonna get me.
Ah, gimme a break, will ya?
They were jumping on the car and making these weird sounds.
Sure it wasn't that retarded kid,
Timmy, up the street?
No, it was the same thing that chased me last night.
Well, what are we gonna do?
You're crazy, man.
Um...
Oh, shit.
I've gotta talk to you.
And it's in that box?
Yep.
Okay. I believe you.
Jesus!
What's goin' on up there?
Well, there's something I didn't tell ya.
I was spyin' on Tommy's funeral from the Groves with your binoculars.
And after everybody had left, that Tall Man picked up
Tommy's coffin all by himself and put it in the hearse and drove off.
You're crazy!
I helped carry that sucker myself.
It must've weighed over 500 pounds.
I can't figure this thing out.
But I do know one thing.
Something weird is going on up there.
We're goin' for the sheriff.
Go get your evidence.
All right!
That's funny.
Jody! Jody!
What the...
The garbage disposal.
Come on.
Ready? Go!
Would you look at that?
Hey, guys.
I thought I'd come over and see what was goin' on before the kids got out of summer school.
Mike, you wanna ride along with me today?
It's pretty warm outside and the ice cream's gonna be flying fast and furious.
Remember how good you were at crowd control last time?
Hey, what's goin' on here?
What the hell is goin' on?
Here, you keep that.
Now remember, you don't aim a gun at a man unless you intend to shoot him.
And you don't shoot a man unless you intend to kill him.
No warning shots.
- Hey, you listening to me?
- Yeah.
No warning shots.
Warning shots are bullshit.
You shoot to kill or you don't shoot at all.
Now you'll be safe here.
Lock all the doors and windows.
- And don't follow me.
- You sure you're gonna be okay with that?
I'm just gonna go up there and take a look around. Nobody's gonna see me.
But, heck, a Colt Army issue will put a man down and keep him there.
Remember that broken basement window around by the side.
And be careful.
All right, who's in there?
Mike?
Damn door latch. Get in.
Oh, here it comes!
There's nobody drivin' that mother!
The pump's in the backseat.
Okay. Slow down, and let him ride right up on our ass.
There was nobody... there was nobody driving!
I'm gonna get that bastard.
Oh, Jesus.
All right, speed up.
I want to put a few in the engine.
Okay.
Holy shit!
It's one of those dwarves.
It went right through it.
Tommy!
Reggie.
We got one of 'em.
Uh, on Colton in the Groves.
All right. Uh, Reg?
Bring your truck.
Holy Jesus!
You didn't tell me the dwarf was Tommy.
Hell, we buried him on Monday, and look what they did to him.
He's only three feet long!
He must still weigh 200 pounds.
What's all this yellow shit coming out of his head?
Careful. Get him in there.
- Better padlock it.
- Yeah.
This guy's not gonna leak all over my ice cream, is he?
We'll see you back at the house.
Right.
You boys back yet?
Jesus Christ, Myrtle.
You almost gave me a coronary.
But I just can't figure out why.
Why they're taking these bodies and crushing them down to half size.
Crushing 'em.
What about Mom and Dad?
They're up there too.
Hey, just forget about that.
Okay.
I see it. I see it all now.
What we gotta do is we gotta snag that tall dude, and stomp the shit out of him.
And we'll find out what the hell is going on up there.
Yeah. We'll lay that sucker out flat and drive a stake through his goddamn heart!
You gotta be shittin' me, man.
That mother's strong.
Hey, hold on. First thing is,
I want Mike out of here.
Reg, you take him over to Sally's, the antique store.
He'll be safe there. Then hustle on back.
And, Mike, no arguments.
Jody sure sounded strange on the phone.
I hope he's feeling okay.
Sally, did you see these new settings?
Oh, these are nice.
You know, I think I'm gonna lock up.
Michael, when you get sleepy,
I've got a bed made up for you in back.
- You have to take me home.
- But why?
No questions. You must take me home.
Oh, my God. Pull over.
Stay in the car and don't get out.
I'll be right back.
Michael, wait a minute.
Is that Reggie's truck?
Let's get out of here, quick!
- Michael, what is going on?
- Just get me home.
What the hell is that?
Oh, shit!
Get out of here.
Don't open it!
No!
Oh, God.
It got Sally and Suzy.
What?
Up at Morningside.
And Reggie too.
You better get on up to your room.
- I'm goin' with you.
- Nope.
I'm not lettin' you go by yourself.
Let me go, goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!
You're not lettin' me go, are ya?
You're never coming back, you goddamn bastard!
Don't leave me alone!
Open the damn door!
I've been waiting for you.
He has to be in there.
I'm sorry, Daddy... but we had to.
Oh, my God!
- Jody?
- Yeah?
I opened up his...
Forget it.
Come on.
There's this door down here... and I'll bet there's something behind it.
Let's take a look then.
Well, that's the door.
- Hey, man, I don't know...
- Hey!
- Hi, guys.
- Reg! You ain't dead.
No, and I ain't three foot two yet, either.
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, man, I don't know.
I've been hidin' in a casket, playin' like a stiff.
But I did find the girls.
I found Sally and Sue, and a couple other girls I never even saw before.
- Were they dead?
- No.
I snuck 'em out a window, and they took off through the bushes like scared rabbits.
All right.
Well, after you, my friend.
You be my guest, man.
Jesus.
Dwarves!
God, Reggie! Look at this.
Don't fear.
Wow.
Jesus!
God! I just grabbed him there.
Slaves.
- What?
- Slaves.
They're using them for slaves.
The dwarves.
And they gotta crush 'em
'cause of the gravity... and the heat.
And this is the door to their planet.
Yeah.
And these guys are all ready to go.
Yeah.
- Okay, stay together.
- Wait a sec. I think I got a lighter.
Quick, light it up.
Over here. Follow me.
Jody, where are ya?
Mike!
Ah, shit!
Mike!
Mike, where are ya?
Mike!
Jody!
Jody, where are ya!
Jody! Jody!
Jody!
Jody, where are ya?
Mike! Mike!
Mike! Mike, come on. We gotta find Reggie.
Where's Reggie? We gotta find him.
- It's Reggie!
- No!
- Come on! We got to help him.
- No, you can't help him. He's dead.
There's a... there's an old mine shaft way down by the... by the end of Singer's Creek.
A thousand feet straight down.
We just gotta... we just gotta figure a way to get him up there.
What are we gonna do without Reggie?
Reggie's the last he'll ever get...
'cause we're gonna run that tall bastard straight down to hell.
Look, you go in and try to find more ammo.
I'm gonna haul ass over there and get rid of that warning barrier around the mine shaft and camouflage it.
Lock up the house good, man, and stay in there. I'll be right back.
Boy!
You play a good game, boy.
But the game is finished.
Now you die.
Don't fear.
Don't fear.
Don't fear.
I hear the sounds.
I know those rocks aren't gonna hold him.
Not for long.
Hey, you had a dream.
Just a nightmare.
What do you expect? You've hardly slept since the funeral last week.
I know those rocks aren't gonna hold him.
First he took Mom and Dad... then he took Jody.
Now he's after me.
Mike, that Tall Man of yours did not take Jody away.
Jody died in a car wreck.
Mike.
You had a bad dream.
I know you're scared... but you're not alone.
I'll take care of you.
I know I can't ever take Jody's place... but I'm sure as hell gonna try.
It seemed so real.
You know, partner, what we need is a change of scenery.
Why don't you and me hit the road for a couple of weeks?
Where'll we go?
Well, I don't know. I guess we can figure that one out when we get there.
Okay.
Well, get on upstairs.
Get your gear together.
'Cause we leave when the sun comes up.
Boy!
I won.
What do you mean, you won?
You did not.
I did too. The old man can still beat him.
- Oh, come on, Dad. You saw it, didn't you? I won.
- Close. Really close.
- Yeah.
- All right. If it was close, let's go again. We'll go...
Wait a minute. How many times do I have to beat you?
- You beat me?
- Yeah, I beat you.
- Hey. Hey!
- All right! Listen, you won!
Leave your father alone. All this exercise is making me hungry.
Come on, Dad.
All right, you won.
No, no. You won.
- No, you won.
- No, no. You won.
- No, you won.
- Mr. Childress?
Telephone for you, sir, on the terrace.
Better get here as soon as you can.
I'll tell Peter.
Hey, what will living in the States be like, Dad?
I don't know.
You've been away a long time.
Yeah, it's been since Mom died.
Yeah.
Why Chicago?
Good school for you. The best.
- You could go out for football.
- What, and give up soccer?
Well, football's more popular in the States.
Football players are more popular with the girls.
Dad.
I don't know. School and sports, all that stuff-
I just won't fit in there.
Feel like some kind of freak.
- What is this?
- I don't know. Maybe if I knew what was wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Well, I might do okay in a zoo.
Now, what the hell are you doing?
Feeling sorry for yourself?
Okay, you have a talent that would shock the hell out of people, but it's a talent that also can be put to good use.
- Dad...
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Now, Childress understands this. That's why he wants you to go to this school in Chicago.
You'll meet other kids that are... that are special like you.
Robin, I'll be with you all the way.
If it doesn't work out, we'll do something else.
Robin.
Do me a favor. I want to talk to your father alone one minute.
Sure.
I'll be on the terrace, Dad.
Okay.
Peter, you've gotta give me the telephone number... of that dame from the antique shop.
Nothing antique about her.
Everything works.
Gonna miss you.
Well, I'm not gonna miss you.
Twenty years together in the same agency is more than enough.
You taught me a lot.
- No, you did.
- Look, if this is gonna be a teary farewell, get your ass out of here.
No tears. All laughs.
Right.
I'll say good-bye to your son over there.
Waiter.
Regular luncheon for two.
My dad!
Get Robin out of here!
- Dad.
- Robin, your father's all right. He's a professional.
They're after my dad.
Robin, they're after all of us.
For Christ's sakes.
Dad?
They killed my dad.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
They killed my dad.
It's all right.
Robertson, where the hell are you?
Give me the gun! I'm gonna find out who broke that security.
- I'll check on it.
- No! Get this boy out of here.
- Come on, Robin. Move. Let's go. Into the car.
- Get him out of here.
- Let's go. Hurry. Come on!
- It'll be all right, Robin. It'll be all right.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's all right, Jonathan. You did a very good job.
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.
- Up by the road. Go on.
- Sure.
Give me the film.
That's the great Johnny Dunbar.
In Chicago it's already 87 degrees this morning,
13 minutes after 10:00.
So I said, "Mother, what do you want from me?"
I mean, you got this terrific job.
You're all over the world.
I mean, I get to see you maybe once a month, if I'm lucky, right?
"Okay, I'm happy for you.
I really am."
But I said, "Just don't try and run my life..." when you happen to be around the house for a few days...
"and feel like playing mom."
I know.
They just... They just don't know how to let go, and they get so hurt when you try to explain to them.
Really.
Anyway, let's see if you know this junk.
January 10, 1946.
That was the first United Nations
General Assembly... that was held in London, right?
- Good.
- See, I told you. I never forget dates.
All right. Who was elected president of the assembly?
It's names I have trouble with.
- LaRue, don't tell me.
- I didn't say anything.
Yes, you did. You said
"Raymond." I heard you.
I did not. Raymond?
His name wasn't Raymond.
It was...
Raymond Dunwoodie.
Who was Raymond Dunwoodie?
I don't know. It's just...
That-That name just came into my head. I don't know.
So what was the right answer?
Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium.
Oh, yes, Paul-Henri Spaak.
Okay. Next.
I always get that one wrong.
"The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are?"
The United States, Russia...
I know.
Let's just forget the whole thing.
Forget it? Are you crazy?
We've got a final.
LaRue, I know this stuff.
- We have a final at 2:00.
- I know, and I'm gonna pass with flying colors.
I promise you.
- Hey, guess what.
- What?
We got a buddy.
Oh, my God.
What a... What a creep.
He's walking backwards now.
- Should we give him money?
- No!
God, what do you take me for?
I don't know.
Oh, he's not gonna bother us.
- I hope we pass.
- Sure!
- Here.
- Two popcorns, please.
- Hello?
- Mr. Johnson?
Yes?
It's Raymond Dunwoodie.
What is it, Raymond?
Now, look, I haven't changed my mind.
I mean, there's nothing
I can do for you personally, but I may have somebody to locate your son.
You'd better not be wasting my time.
No, no. I'm at the beach, and I made a contact.
She's a kid... m-maybe 17... and she's psychic.
Are you sure?
That's right, she's psychic.
Bring her here.
I don't have her yet, but I could get her.
Now, look, Mr. Johnson?
This is gonna cost.
How much?
I don't mean 50 or 100 bucks.
Not for this girl.
How much, Raymond?
I don't have that kind of money.
Oh, that's a sad story, Mr. J.
Almost as sad as the story you told me about your boy.
Dunwoodie paid off for us.
We've completed the trace.
He's talking to Sandza at the Plymouth Hotel.
Step inside, off the street.
Yes, sir.
Is this man registered here?
I don't know.
I just came on a half hour ago myself.
We think he's been here a few days.
You ain't the police, is you?
Oh, well, I'm what you'd consider well-traveled, but I don't believe I ever heard of you gentlemen.
We don't spend a dime on public relations.
Yeah, well, that would be
Mr. R.V. Johnson, Room 512, just down the hall to your left.
Hey, government man.
Don't bust my door down, please.
Use the pass key.
Chase 1 to Chase 2...
He's loose. Do you copy?
He's loose. Do you copy?
Chase 1 to Chase 2.
He's loose. Do you copy?
Gunmen of the Hanafi
Muslim sect... continue their siege of three Washington buildings.
Damn it.
Did you hear that, Vivian?
Now, that's what
I'm talking about!
Them bozos in Washington are mugging the whole damn country.
They got every court in the land helping 'em make it legal.
Yeah, well, if you ask me what happened to the milk of human kindness,
I'd have to tell you, frankly, that the whole world has dried up at the tit.
You can say that again, pal.
I swear to hell,
I don't know where...
Vivian!
Yes, Mother Nuckells.
I'm coming.
Couldn't you just once manage to go potty by yourself?
Somebody's in my room!
All right, now.
Nobody's going to get hurt.
I just want some clothes.
He came in my window.
Do you know who he is?
I told you we should've moved to Melrose Park.
Harry, this wouldn't be happening if we lived in Melrose Park.
You want clothes.
Old clothes.
Anything you've got.
You can see, I need clothes.
I can't go anywhere like this.
Just... the clothes.
Yes.
Oh, I had to leave the hotel in a hurry, so could you spare a couple of dollars?
I knew it.
This is a graphic example of biofeedback.
We're converting the very low-voltage alpha-wave energy... into electricity to run that train.
And that train will only run when my friend Hester... is in alpha.
Now, as you may have hoped, there are more practical applications to biofeedback training.
If you can learn to regulate your brain waves, you can gain control of your heart rate, blood pressure, headaches, backaches, even, ladies, cold feet.
Now, I work at the Paragon Institute, where we study the phenomena of extrasensory perception.
And we are using biofeedback techniques... to tap the almost limitless resources of the human mind...
And I am speaking now of such things as thought transmissions, commonly known as telepathy.
Now, that machine is called a magnetometer, and it records the fluctuations... of the human electromagnetic field... during our experiments, and I guess Hester's had it.
Thank you, Hester.
I want to stress that no particular talent is needed to achieve this.
Anybody can achieve alpha, with a little patience.
- Want to try?
- Sure.
Try to remember... that "alpha" is another word for "passive."
Right.
Visualize sitting in an empty theater... in front of a blank screen, and let that screen fill your mind.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Gillian? Hey, hey, hey.
Are you all right?
What is she doing?
I have no idea.
Don't mind about them.
It's okay. You all right?
Creep.
I'd say I'm pretty sound, considering the ravages of time.
For instance, I don't have the use of any more... than one of my limbs or vital organs.
Good thing the Lord God Jehovah... built in so many spare parts.
But when the old ticker gives out, well, that's it.
Ain't that the truth.
How long do you think you'll be staying?
Oh, shut up, Vivian.
Let the boy enjoy his breakfast.
Thank you.
What is it they want you for?
I'm a high-level security risk.
Did you get it yet?
- No.
- It's been over two months!
Would you shut up, Betsy?
It does not.
I mean, it happens...
Gillian, I was saving that seat for Cheryl.
Too bad.
Cheryl can sit over here.
Oh, God.
Now what am I gonna do?
Oh, Cheryl, I'm sorry. I tried to save a seat for you, but Gillian just took it.
Look, you can have my seat.
Hey, watch it.
Good Lord, Pam. If you're that nervous, why don't you masturbate?
Are you ready for that?
Are you ready for tomorrow?
You two are so sweet.
When are you getting married?
See any ghosts today, Gillian?
Cheryl, you're not very funny.
Gillian's not very funny.
I mean, there are more mature ways to get attention, don't you think, Gillian?
Say, have you guys seen
Mr. Watkins's new girlfriend?
Oh, yeah. Where'd he pick that chick up?
Read my mind!
What?
Tell me what I'm thinking.
Come on.
Right now, read my mind.
Well, that's what they say you can do, isn't it?
No. I don't know how to read minds, Cheryl.
That's ridiculous.
- Listen, Cheryl...
- Shut up, LaRue!
I only want to find something out.
That's all.
All right. Come on.
Oh, great. Good.
Now pay attention, everybody.
- Gillian's gonna perform for us.
- I didn't say I...
Cheryl, look. I don't know anything about reading minds, all right?
I mean, I don't even know what I'm thinking most of the time, so... get off my back.
Gillian, you're so full of shit.
Cheryl, you're an asshole.
Just shut up.
She can't help being upset.
She has to take it out on someone.
What did you say?
Oh, Cheryl, you don't want everyone to know that you're pregnant, do you?
- What? I would like for you to explain that little remark!
- Cheryl...
Just what do you think you know about me?
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Come on, tell me!
- Let go, Cheryl. Let go.
- Tell me!
- Tell me.
- Cheryl, please let go.
- Cheryl.
- Come on, tell me.
- No! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- Are you all right, Cheryl?
Help me!
Oh, God. Oh, God!
I put some cookies in a bag for ya.
You might get hungry later on.
Thank you.
How's your hair? Dry yet?
Oh, it's fine.
Hey!
Just fine.
That Shinola will wash right out.
I'd appreciate it if you'd wait till after M*A*S*H to let them go.
M*A*S*H? I'll wait till Sunrise Semester.
Might as well just leave 'em there.
They ain't got anything to say I want to hear.
I've heard it all before.
Peter. That your real name?
That's right.
Can't see a reason why you'd make up lies to tell me.
I don't matter anyhow.
I wouldn't lie to you,
Mother Nuckells.
You know that.
And I hope you find your son.
If he's alive, I'll find him.
And if the feds get in your way, shoot 'em.
Just shoot 'em.
It's all they deserve.
Yeah. There's so many of 'em.
They just keep coming.
Kill 'em. Kill 'em.
Now, don't overwork yourself,
Mother Nuckells.
Remember, it's bad for the old ticker?
Thank you.
You want to get us out of here now?
Come on, Mother. Oh, please!
Please.

Okay, man. I dig.

- I don't want to go home.
I want to go home right now.
Hey, come on.
Hey, how's that for a horn?
What... What if I want to go home?
But listen to that stereo.
I mean, you ever heard better fucking stereo sound in your life?
How can you be sure it's Sandza?
He had to be in the neighborhood.
All we had to do was wait.
I trained with him.
I know his style.
What's he doing now? Over.
Looks like off-duty cops in that Cadillac ahead of us.
There's nothing he can do now.
- Can I help you, pop?
- You're under arrest.
What?
You're under arrest for impersonating police officers.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look out!
What the hell!
He's got a piece.
It's in my armpit.
All right. What do you want me to do?
Drive down that alley. Fast.
Crazy son of a bitch!
Take a right.
Head for Lower River Drive.
Faster.
Damn!
Holy shit!
Should I drive a little faster?
- No. Slower.
- Slower?
Right now, you're the only two people in the world I feel safe with.
I want to enjoy your company.
Yeah, okay. Sure. Sure.
Why not? We'll...
We'll just cruise around a little bit.
Maybe after a while, you'll want to talk.
Yeah.
What's your name?
- Peter.
- I'm Marty O'Brien.
Is that gun too uncomfortable in your armpit?
Oh, no, no, no. I want you to meet my partner, Officer Eggleston.
Hi, hi, Peter.
Why don't you call me Bob?
Hi, Bob.
Nice car.
Yeah. It's brand-new.
I just picked it up about a half hour ago.
I... sure wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
Don't blame you.
That shoe polish in your hair, Peter?
Yes, it is. It's a disguise.
- It's a pretty clever disguise.
- Yeah.
Didn't work though.
They were waiting for me.
Must've been waiting all day.
I gotta give that Childress a lot of credit, the son of a bitch.
Somebody's after you.
Is that it?
What do you suppose he's telling those cops?
Whatever it is, they won't believe him.
I worked for a government agency you never heard of.
They took my son away from me.
They needed him, so they just took him.
Keep your hand in your lap, Marty.
It's a frightening power these people have.
They can make anybody disappear anytime.
Somebody's gotta stop 'em.
Yeah, well, that's right, and if you don't mind my making a suggestion, maybe we can help.
Yeah. You see, Peter,
Marty and myself... have had a lot of experience dealing with... you know...
- People who like kicking other people around.
- Yeah, harassing them.
- I got an idea.
- Hey, that's a terrific idea, Marty.
- Why don't we stop for some coffee?
- Don't stop!
Let's get the hell off this drive!
We're like sitting ducks down here!
All right. Easy, man, easy. We're on your side.
We're just trying to help.
Chase 1 to Top Guy 1. We've got him on the lower drive. Do you copy?
Chase 1, copy.
We're right above you.
Two sedans have been following us.
Standard government issue.
He's right about that. They...
Bob.
- Yes, sir?
- I want you to lose those cars.
- Lose?
- That's right.
Well how do you suppose
I should go about it?
There's a construction site other side of the bridge.
When we get there, I want you to follow my instructions exactly, understand?
Bob, if they can make me disappear, they can make you disappear too.
Chase cars, pull up alongside the Cadillac.
Let's find out what Peter has in mind.
Something's going on here.
Look like feds to you?
Who knows?
Peter, I'm worried about that gun going off, you know, by accident, if we hit a few bumps.
You got something to worry about there.
You say across the bridge when the light changes?
We're not gonna wait for the lights to change, Bob.
We're not?
Go!
Oh, God. Please, God, don't let anything happen to my new car.
Chase 1 to Top Guy 1.
He's crossing bridge into fog.
Losing visual contact. Over.
They're finished.
Let's go home.
That son of a bitch.
Hey, watch where you're going.
I can't see anything in this soup.
- Which way?
- I don't know.
- You go straight, and I'll go left.
- All right.
Now what?
Don't know.
Hear anything?
I don't know.
- Do you?
- Yeah. I definitely hear something.
Chase 1, Chase 1.
We're in pursuit of the Caddy.
I see him.
I see him. He's over there.
Around to the right!
Jesus.
How the hell was I suppo...
There they are. Come on!
Go on! Get moving!
All right.
Get out, both of you.
Leave the motor running.
I can't believe it.
Not a scratch.
Throw your pieces in the lake.
What are you gonna do now, Peter?
When you see Childress, ask him if it was worth his arm.
What happened to his arm, Peter?
I killed it, with a machine gun.
- Hey, Peter, now, wait.
- Tell Childress to follow me!
I want him to follow me this time!
Not in my car, man.
- Watch out, Bob!
- Hey. Wait. No, Peter! Let's talk about this!
Gillian, I know you're upset, but it's silly.
I was told Cheryl has a history of nosebleeds.
An ice pack stopped the bleeding in five minutes.
But what I'm trying to tell you is I made it happen.
Oh, that's impossible.
Look, now, Mother, what about when you started bleeding?
Remember, a couple of weeks ago?
I mean, you said yourself that cut was healed, and it opened right up. I mean... Don't!
Why not?
'Cause it could happen to you.
Gillian, I've had a long flight, and I'm very tired.
And I want you to stop carrying on like this.
Don't be mad at me.
Sweetheart, I'm not.
I always thought we could tell each other anything.
Anything, no matter what.
We can.
Mother, I love you, but I'm afraid.
Afraid to let me touch you?
Yes.
Honey, I'm home, and I'll stay here just as long as you need me.
I promise.
But what we really should do now is talk to someone.
And Steve Brenneman has had wonderful success working with therapy...
Mother, I'm not going to a psychiatrist.
Hello?
Oh, it's you.
Oh, that was a good one.
Really passionate.
I... I need...
I'm...
Listen, I'm a nurse, and if my phone's tied up... and they can't get hold of me...
So maybe you could breathe for someone else tonight.
I...
I need... I need... I...
I need your body, baby!
Come on, baby, it's me!
Oh. Oh, my God.
Why do we always have to meet in this van?
Couldn't we go to my place just this once?
Too dangerous.
Well, for the sake of argument, let's assume that everybody at the institute... has their phones tapped.
But nobody's watching me, for heaven's sakes.
They're always watching.
Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic, and if he'd had enough time, he'd have found Robin for me.
But Childress was watching him.
How else you think they got to me?
Why are you so afraid of this guy?
I'm not afraid of Childress.
He's afraid of me.
He knows I'll get my son back.
Now, what about those files?
I'm nobody. I just work there.
I don't have access to any vital secrets.
You mean you didn't get a chance to examine the files at Paragon?
- Yes, I did.
- And?
Robin is...
Well, he's...
Dead.
- According to the records...
- Of course that's what the records say.
Childress keeps the records.
What if it's true?
Hester, look at me.
I'm proof-proof that my son is alive, or else why would Childress be so anxious to put me away?
Well, thank God I'm somewhere.
You're the only one who can help me.
How long did you follow me around... before taking a chance on me?
Too long.
Well, thanks.
Thanks for picking me.
You know what, Hester? You don't realize how beautiful you really are.
Somewhere, they're doing a hell of a lot of research... much more complicated than Paragon.
God only knows what they're doing to my son.
Peter, if Robin is still...
Well, I promise I'll do everything
I can to help find Robin.
But you take too much for granted.
You trust too many people.
Paragon Institute.
Sounds like a haven for quacks.
But their references are good.
Hey, it's right up there on the left.
Gil, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced... this is not an appropriate course of action.
Mother, I like Dr. Lindstrom.
Anyway, I'm old enough to know what I'm doing.
Well, I don't intend to let you stay here... until they've answered a lot of questions,
- and I mean that, Gillian.
- Okay.
- Hi, Gillian.
- Hi.
- Mrs. Bellaver.
- Yes.
I'm Ellen Lindstrom.
How do you do?
- Please come in.
- Thank you.
Dr. McKeever is busy monitoring a test, but he should be with us shortly.
Maybe you'd like to look around.
Thank you.
I've been here before.
This was Babe Gifford's house.
Yes. We bought the house from the Giffords.
It was so beautifully furnished.
We tried to make as few alterations as possible.
As a matter of fact,
Gillian's suite is particularly attractive.
I don't understand why you want Gillian to stay here.
That was my idea,
Mrs. Bellaver.
Gillian and Catherine Bellaver,
- this is our director, Jim McKeever.
- Mrs. Bellaver.
How do you do?
- Gillian.
- Hi.
We have young people staying with us all the time while they help with our evaluation program.
Thanks, Ellie.
We can do a better job of judging psychic ability... if there's a minimum of distractions.
Of course, it's not all work and no play.
There's a good library right here and a game room down the hall.
Do you play backgammon,
Gillian?
- Yeah.
- Good.
And our housekeeper is the best Irish cook in Chicago,
I'm sorry to say.
I'd like to know what kind of program you're talking about, Doctor.
Oh, certainly. Why don't we have a look at one of our workshops?
Telepathy is a timeless form of communication.
Now, my five-year-old daughter was very good at this.
But the older and more sophisticated we become, the more we rationalize what our senses try to tell us.
Is this all
Gillian will be doing?
Yes. This and similar tests under my personal supervision.
We'll take very good care of her,
Mrs. Bellaver.
I'll be fine. Don't worry.
And I'll see you in a couple of weeks, okay?
Well, all right, but I'll call you the minute I get to Paris.
- And you know where I'm staying in case you change your mind.
- Mother, I'll be fine.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mrs. Bellaver.
Nice meeting you.
Good-bye, Gillian.
Have a good trip.
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.
Do you like it?
Geez, look at this.
It's great!
I got my own stereo.
I'll start unpacking.
- You just look around, make yourself comfortable.
- This is beautiful.
"Paragon."
That's the best there is, right?
Something that can't be equaled, like the incredible power of the human mind.
We hope you'll learn to use that power to develop your gift.
It's not a gift.
It's more like having a bad tooth and never knowing when it's gonna hurt.
That's because a part of the mind you've never used before... becomes sensitized.
Sensitized to what?
The bioplasmic universe.
Come again?
The bioplasmic universe.
And in that universe is a record... of every human impulse, word and deed... of lives past and lives to come.
Occasionally, you make a... a connection... between the timeless world... and the physical world.
You have what clairvoyants call "a vision."
Yeah, but it's never about me though.
I mean, I never see anything about me.
So I'm glad I don't.
Which one is me?
Mine just keeps drifting along.
Hester!
Quit shooting me.
This is great.
I've been thinking.
We should have a little treat.
Just for ourselves.
- Like what?
- Hot fudge sundaes.
Vanilla and chocolate ice cream.
- Hester.
- Bananas, maraschino cherries.
Coconut, strawberry topping.
- Whipped cream all over the top.
- No. Stop.
Ta-da!
Oh, my God. You guys!
If I don't finish these tests pretty soon,
I'm gonna get so fat you're gonna have to roll me out of here.
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks.
Come on. You've earned it.
You're right. What the...
Besides, what are you talking about?
You look terrific.
Not after this.
- You have a boyfriend?
- No. No one special.
What about you? Pretty slim pickings around here.
Yeah, Paragon is just a job.
Well, do you have a boyfriend?
Have I got a boyfriend!
What is he like?
Well, he's very charming.
He swept me right off my feet, in the park.
In the park?
Yeah. He picked me up in the park.
What was his line?
H-He said he needed help.
Some line.
What are you talking about?
It worked.
True. What does he do?
Do?
Oh, he-he travels around a lot.
Where?
Oh, all over.
You know.
Oh, when he comes to town, we go to... parties.
He loves people.
He takes me out dancing, buys me presents.
Oh, he dresses beautifully, and he's a good dancer.
Yeah?
The only trouble is, he's very hard to get hold of.
Oh, come on. Let's dig in.
You mean gross out.
Look at this.
And when I was your age,
I had one great ambition.
- What?
- To be Fred Astaire.
Oh, my God.
As you can see,
I failed miserably.
Well, I took dance for a couple of years.
Yes. My mother insisted.
You see, she didn't think
I was any too graceful.
Don't-Don't touch me anymore.
Please don't touch me.
Oh, God!
God!
What happened?
Tomorrow, we do some real testing, make things as challenging as possible for Gillian.
Nelson, as soon as Gillian begins to demonstrate her psychometric talents,
I want complete audio and videotape records of the tests.
Will she be working in the Faraday cage?
No, no, no. This girl's not a cheat.
She's the real thing.
Now, do we have any bleeders in the group?
No.
Anyone who's had even minor surgery in the past three months?
No, sir.
How about ulcers?
Hester, Kristen, Lorraine, if you girls are into your monthlies, I don't want you around when Gillian is testing.
Are you serious?
I'm very serious.
Gillian's power to psychometrize is spontaneous.
She creates an enormously powerful electromagnetic field.
Almost everyone exposed to it will bleed.
Some will bleed a little, some a lot.
What is this kid, a vampire?
Do you want to continue working here?
Then I don't want to hear any more funny remarks like that!
How do you account for it?
We can't account for it.
Not yet.
Gillian, can you hear me?
Jim, it takes a few moments for the Evapil to take effect.
Ellie, please.
Gillian, what did you see on the stairs?
A boy.
Robin.
Have you seen him before?
Yeah.
I have.
Gillian and Robin were in touch telepathically.
Think of what we would accomplish if Robin were alive.
- I'm sending her home.
- Jim.
Why?
Because I don't want to be responsible for Gillian Bellaver.
- I don't think you mean...
- Ellie, I don't want to talk about it anymore!
It's late.
And we're both overexcited.
Listen, I don't understand something.
This is a marvelous opportunity for us.
We only had Robin for a few days, but I think that Gillian really wants to work with us, and she is the best subject for psychic research I have ever seen.
Ellie, even the most backward tribes, the most primitive cultures on earth, would welcome the birth of a Robin Sandza.
And in time, he'd become their magician, their prophet, their great healer.
But there is no place for these kids in our culture... because they're so superior to what we hold sacred.
And what a culture can't assimilate, it destroys.
Jim, what really happened to Robin Sandza?
He was running on the steps, taking them... two or three at a time, and he... slipped, went through the window.
But why was he running?
I don't know, Ellie.
I wasn't here.
Jim.
Why don't you come up to my place?
I mean,
I'll scramble some eggs...
No. I'm...
I'm gonna finish this.
Then I'm gonna... stretch out on the couch for a couple of hours.
What time is it?
My watch has stopped.
It's a quarter after 4:00.
Excuse me.
It's later than I thought.
Thanks, Ellie.
Well, good night, Jim.
Morning.
What do you want?
My arm hurts.
It's dead.
Why should it still hurt?
You're the brain expert, so tell me.
Is it all in my head, Doctor?
That's an oversimplification, but there's nothing I can do.
That's not why I came here.
Tell me about Gillian Bellaver.
My people always know what's going on here, even if you're slow to keep me informed.
Will the girl be another Robin Sandza?
- No.
- Really?
Poor Peter.
If he only knew that Robin doesn't care anymore... doesn't care if his father's alive or dead.
What the hell have you done to that boy?
Oh, he's being treated like a prince.
He is. He's royalty. Unique.
Chinese don't have one.
Soviets don't have one.
In all the world, there's no one quite like Robin Sandza... unless it's this girl.
How can you hold him against his will and get any kind of results?
Against his will?
You don't understand
Robin's needs.
We do.
Are you testing the girl today?
She's... failed every test.
She's a fake.
I'm sending her home. I don't have time to waste on people...
Don't do that to me, Doctor.
Don't ever try lying to me.
For God's sakes, she's just a child.
She doesn't know anything.
She has no control over what she's doing.
Robin had no control when he came here.
Just raw ability.
Doctor, I wish you could see him now.
For God's sakes.
I want you to get yourself together.
Stop fudging your responsibilities.
This girl is important to me.
I'm assigning extra security.
Why?
If I know Peter, he penetrated your security weeks ago.
He probably knows
I have Gillian Bellaver.
I don't know who his confederate is, but I'm looking into it.
She's all right.
Try that one.
I will, I will.
Kristen, where's Dr. McKeever?
Oh, he's down at Medtronics, checking out the new testing equipment.
Do you know when he'll be back?
He said not before dinner.
Where's Gillian?
Having breakfast.
I could use a cup of coffee myself.
A club.
Good morning, Gillian.
You're not eating much.
I'm not very hungry.
Did you hear what happened yesterday?
Dr. McKeever's hand started bleeding.
Yes, I do know about that.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
I mean, it's why I'm here, isn't it?
I mean, can't anybody help me?
Gillian, we have to work together.
Gillian, do you remember much of what we talked about last night?
Last night?
- Were you here last night, Dr. Lindstrom?
- That's right.
While you were with Dr. McKeever, you had some sort of vision that upset you.
You were in a fugue state for a while.
We gave you something to help you relax, and I made the suggestion that you consciously forget whatever was troubling you.
And, apparently, it worked better than I thought.
So, you don't remember anything about Robin Sandza?
No. Who's Robin Sandza?
He's a boy your age... with powers like yours.
Like me? Well, where is he?
I mean, do you think
I could talk to him?
Do you know him?
I feel like I do.
What can you tell me about him?
He's...
It's not very clear. He's...
He's, like, dreaming or... not... awake yet.
Drugged.
Stop!
Just relax, Robin. Relax.
It's gonna be okay.
Gillian, where are you?
Get that light off him.
Disturbance in the magnetic field on the last P.K.
Trial was to cast a character with a parametrical resonance on a frequency of five cycles.
We'll go for a magnetometer check now.
The infrared area scanning system is operational.
With this trial, we want a two-dimensional view of the field potentials.
We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation.
We have differentiation between the "P" and "T" waves.
Heart action slightly arrhythmic.
Let me have that electrogram reading again, please.
Pulse, 66.
Pressure, 114 over 92.
Pulse steady at 67.
Pressure, 115 over 94.
Robin, we're going to show you a film.
Now, there's nothing in there that can possibly harm you, but you must keep watching, okay?
Pulse beginning to rise, 73.
Pressure, 115 over 94.
Magnetometer holding at 640.
Pulse is 78.
Pressure, 129 over 111.
No. Keep watching.
Keep watching.
We have a mild electrostatic field fluctuation.
Body temperature, 89.59.
Pulse steady at 65.
Robin, please, keep watching.
Heartbeat, brain, relative to force field fluctuation in ratio.
No! No!
Robin, please, for God's sake, watch the screen.
- Gillian!
- Slight increase in activity...
Gillian!
Where is Robin now, Gillian?
My dad! They're after my dad!
Dad!
No!
Hester!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, listen.
I need to talk to my mother.
Do you think I could call my mother?
You can talk to your mom in a little while, but you've had an awful shock, and you need to rest.
- Here.
- What... What is that?
It's a sedative.
It's like aspirin.
You take aspirin, don't you?
Here's some water.
Drink plenty of water.
Oh, that's a good girl.
- I need to see Dr. McKeever.
- Sure.
I have to know what happened to Ellen.
They'll be here in a little while. Just...
I'll stay here with you.
Just lie down and-and relax.
No, no.
I gotta get out of here.
- I gotta go... home.
- It's all right, Gillian.
Everything will be all right. We'll take good care of you. Now don't worry.
Ellen's X-rays were encouraging. She's beginning to show signs of consciousness.
It had to be a cerebral hemorrhage, something in the brain.
She's a fake.
You were gonna send her home.
Is that the kind of cooperation
I can expect, Doctor?
I want Gillian Bellaver at the P.S. I. Facility tomorrow.
Do we let her mother know? She's wealthy.
She has powerful friends.
Gillian can't just dis...
Peter, it's impossible.
I'll never be able to get that girl out of that place.
I'll blow it.
Getting out of Paragon is a hell of a lot easier than getting in.
What do I say to Gillian?
Tell her everything.
Tell her what they did to Robin.
They'll do the same thing to her.
- What if she won't listen to me?
- Look, I don't have much time.
That girl can lead me to Robin.
Well, she was doped the last time I saw her.
- Everything is set for tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
I need your help. Please.
You feel all right, Robin?
You know, that wasn't a very smart thing to do.
You could've been very badly hurt.
Why were you running away?
I mean, you didn't have to use the window.
There is a door.
Yeah. Like they'd really let me just walk out the door.
Why didn't you come to me?
'Cause you're one of them.
I just wanna get out of here.
I hate this place.
Hate these doctors and the tests.
Driving me crazy.
I can't even sleep.
And you want to get away from me too.
Is that it?
Well, what do you care?
I care very much.
What's the matter, Robin?
Don't you trust me anymore?
I-I don't know.
But you do want to get out of here, don't you?
Yeah.
All right.
Then we'll go together.
- Go where?
- Gillian.
Well, I have this place in the country, north of Chicago in Lakeview.
Gillian?
You can do whatever you like.
You don't have to see anybody.
You don't have to talk to anybody... not even me.
Really?
Yes, really.
Would you like to do that?
Sure.
Gillian?
Hi, Hester.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
This was Robin's room when he was here.
Yes, it was.
He's in terrible trouble now.
Those people, they should be trying to help him.
What people?
Where Robin is.
But they won't leave him alone.
I mean, it was like they were deliberately trying to hurt him.
- Hester. Don't!
- Wait, wait. Come here.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not bleeding.
- You know where Robin is?
- Yeah, I do.
Would you like to see him?
I need to see him.
Well, I think we can work that out.
How?
Well, Dr. McKeever says I'm supposed to give these to you... to keep you happy and harmless.
Do you know what I mean?
- No. What...
- So you'll have to pretend that you took them... because I have to get you out of here tomorrow.
Otherwise, you could be in terrible trouble yourself.
What are you saying?
What is going on?
Honey, I've got so much to tell you.
Would you like a drink?
You look tired.
I am tired.
How's our boy wonder?
Those films of his father's death have unleashed an incredible emotional force.
Why, he's developing the power of an atomic reactor.
Or an atomic bomb.
What are you giving him to calm him down?
Every day, he has 3,000 milligrams of phenobarbital... and 1,000 milligrams of Prolixin...
What the hell are you telling me?
That's enough to kill him.
Drugs no longer have any effect on him.
We've pushed him too far.
He's quite unstable.
He flies into rages over nothing.
He could be dangerous.
What's he trying to prove?
Mentally, Robin has developed this perfect psychotronic relationship... with all kinds of machines.
And so, naturally, he's trying to do the same thing now with his body.
Except that, physically, he's just adequate, and when he fails, he's intolerable.
How is he performing in bed?
Robin wants to please me.
That's the main thing, isn't it?
He needs a rest.
No more tests for at least a month.
Sorry.
He's been under tremendous pressure.
We plan to get away, just the two of us.
No. We almost lost him once, Susan.
I promised. I promised him we'd get away together.
All right.
Take him into the city, show him the sights, but get him back here in 24 hours.
Well, there you are.
Who are they?
These are friends of mine from the institute.
Are you planning on seeing them later?
No, Robin. I'm with you.
Remember?
And which one are you gonna screw first?
Robin, come here. Come on.
- Get away from me.
- Robin, please.
Oh, my God!
Top Guy 2, this is Top Guy 1.
Do you have any coffee left?
Top Guy 1, that's an affirmative.
I've got about a cup of lukewarm coffee left.
You wanna negotiate a trade?
Top Guy 2, I have one
Hershey bar to trade.
Top Guy 1, I read you.
Is that with or without almonds?
All right, Asshole 1 and Asshole 2, stop cluttering up this frequency.
Isn't Dr. McKeever back yet?
Oh, I'm afraid not, Hester.
He's still at the hospital with Ellen.
Can I help?
Dr. McKeever prescribed medication for Gillian this morning, but we're all out of it.
He was very specific about using a non-barbiturate.
So, I guess I'd better go down to the drugstore.
Fine.
Hey.
- Are these ready to be mailed yet?
- Yeah, why?
I could take them down to the post office for you.
That would be terrific.
Oh, I'd really appreciate that,
Hester.
Here, these go in.
These have to be stamped.
And that stuff.
Whoops.
Here comes the pony express!
Oh, hi. Will you be gone long?
Oh, no. I have to go...
I have to whiz to the drugstore.
I have to whiz to the post office.
I have so many things to do,
I'll never get through the day.
Oh, I'm silly.
I can't go without the card.
Door card. Where is that card?
I haven't the vaguest idea.
How's Gillian?
She's doing just fine.
That's good.
Gillian?
How about a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich?
- Okay.
- Good girl.
Oh, damn.
Oh, I'll give you a hand.
- Don't bother. Don't bother.
- It's no bother.
I can take care of it.
It's okay.
Oh, for God's sake, move your ass.
Oh, I'll get that, Gillian.
Here's some more, Hester.
I killed her.
I knew I would the first time I said hello.
I conned her into helping me.
She would have done anything for me.
Hey, you better get some sleep.
Don't stop.
Please keep talking.
I'm afraid to close my eyes, afraid of what I'll see.
- Sip this.
- I don't want it.
Sip it. You'll feel better.
It's the best thing in the world for a toothache.
Tell me about Robin.
You tell me.
It's just that... sometimes I know what's happening to him, what he's... thinking, what he's feeling.
I'm... like a receiver, and-and Robin sends me pictures.
Jesus, that's amazing.
Like twins.
He's a good-looking kid.
You know, you're the kind of girl
Robin would like.
I raised him myself.
His mother died at childbirth.
How come you didn't marry again?
Just hasn't been anybody.
Hester?
Yeah.
Hester.
I'm s...
Hey.
Hey, when was the last time you saw Robin?
Oh, about 11 months.
He's been growing up so fast.
You know, I'm a good athlete, but he's better.
The last at the club, we raced in the pool about 10 laps, and he beat me, but I said, "I won."
He said, "No, you didn't."
I said, "I did too."
He said, "No, you didn't!" He jumped up on the side of the pool, got into a racing dive.
He said, "All right, we'll do it again.
Twenty laps this time."
I was... I was so dead I could hardly drag myself out of the water.
"All right. You won. You won."
Tell me, Gillian.
How is he?
He's okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
We're all gonna be okay.
That's a promise.
Peter!
Stop! Please, let me off!
I'm supposed to get off here!
Peter!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- You were gonna leave me!
Now, look, you got me here.
Now, stay out of this.
He's my son. It's my fight.
My God! I don't know who to trust anymore!
Look, that bus'll take you to Seattle.
I paid the driver.
You'll be safe.
You can't leave me!
Get on that bus and stay on it!
Peter.
But I can take you to him now.
Peter, I was lying before.
Robin's not okay.
He needs us now!
Look, it's too dangerous.
People around me get killed.
Well, damn it! People around me get hurt too!
I make them bleed!
Robin can help me!
Please.
Oh, Jesus!
Why did you do that?
You know I don't like it when you smell like this stuff, don't you?
Could you just leave me alone for a little bit, please, Robin?
I got tired of waiting for you!
What's taking so long?
I wanted to have a bath and a little privacy.
Well, you're taking too goddamn long!
Is everything all right,
Dr. Charles?
Yes, everything's fine.
Now, when the others arrive, would you just hold them downstairs for a moment?
I need a few minutes in here, okay?
I'll call you. Thank you.
Robin?
I'm sorry.
Try to understand the strain I'm under.
I'm very worried about you.
Don't be sorry.
I didn't mean to act like that in there.
It's me.
I'm okay now, though.
- I'm okay.
- Good.
Well, I'm starved. You want to have something to eat?
Sure.
Well, this looks great.
You know,
I've been thinking, Robin, maybe we should take a couple of days off, get a boat, go up to the lake or something.
What do you think?
Why did you do that?
So nobody could get in.
What's the matter, Robin?
You know what's the matter.
No, I don't. What is it?
It's that goddamn girl!
What girl?
The one that's like me.
What do you mean, "like you"?
What? You think
I don't know she's around?
She's right out there.
- There is no girl.
- That's a lie!
No, it isn't, Robin.
She'll do everything
I can do, won't she?
And you won't miss me at all.
What are you trying to say, Robin?
Company's coming.
Yes, you know that.
There'll be you... and me... and Dr. Ives... and Childress.
And that girl makes five.
No, only four, Robin.
You can see that the table is set just for four.
That's right.
I won't be here. I'll be dead.
That girl's taking my place after you poison me!
- What's the matter, Susie?
- Oh, God!
- What's the matter?
- Oh, God!
Remember? I told you I didn't have to touch you to hurt you.
Robin, please, stop!
Well, I'm hurting you now!
Stop it!
'Cause I don't love you anymore!
I'm tired of you!
You're killing her! Stop it!
Sto...
Stop. He...
You're... kill... No.
Susie, get up.
I said, get up.
Robin. God, stop.
I can make you get up.
Turn around.
Up.
R-Robin.
- Up.
- Oh, God, Robin.
Up.
Oh, Rob... Oh, please.
Turn around.
Again.
Faster.
Faster.
Faster. Faster.
Turn.
Again. Turn.
Faster. Faster.
Let's do it.
Here. Give me your hand.
Oh, geez!
Hi, pal.
Thought I'd drop by to say hello.
Long time no see,
Looking good.
Too bad, Peter.
You almost made it.
Where's my son?
Why don't you give up?
Why, you...
- Oh, God!
- Shit!
No!
- Stop!
- Hey!
Stop!
All right, Peter. You said you wanted to see your son.
Go ahead and get him.
Robin?
Can you hear me?
Robin?
Please answer me.
Oh, my God.
Robin!
Where is he?
What have they done to you?
Son?
I know they told you
I was dead.
They wanted me out of the way.
I never gave up.
I kept looking for you all the time.
Come on, Robin. Hey.
Don't you recognize your old man?
Peter!
No!
Hang on, Robin.
Reach up with your other hand.
Come on.
Grab ahold of my jacket.
Climb over me.
That's it. Come on.
You can do it.
That's it. That's it.
No!
Oh, God!
Robin!
All right. Get 'em out of here.
Get 'em out of my sight.
Morning.
I made some coffee.
Would you like some?
No?
It's warmer by the fire.
How did you sleep?
Okay?
I was here most of the night.
I-I guess you don't remember.
Move a little closer to the fire.
I know what you've been going through these past couple of days.
I know how exhausted you must be.
It'll take more than one night's sleep.
I know how I feel.
Peter was my friend.
Maybe the best friend
I'll ever have.
But I had to do what I did.
You saw what happened.
Peter could have saved Robin.
Instead, he let him go.
He deliberately killed his son.
I hope you don't judge me too harshly.
I can't say what I did was right or wrong.
I only know I acted, and it's done.
Robin is gone.
Peter is gone.
And you're the only one who matters now.
Yes, I know that hurts.
That hurts so bad, you want to lie down and die, but you have to survive.
You're a healthy, strong, young girl, and you must survive.
You'll begin by putting all the tragedies behind you.
I think that'll be easier if you accept my help.
All the bad things you heard about me just aren't true.
I'm not a bad man.
All I want is for you to trust me.
Time will take care of the hurting.
That's the simple truth.
Tears are good.
Don't be afraid of crying.
Tears are just what we need right now.
I'll be a good father to you, Gillian.
You can depend on that.
Gillian!
Where are you?
Come on! Come on!
God!
You go to hell.
Oh, God! No! No!
I was hoping to speak to you in private.
Is that really necessary?
I'd say so, yes.
OK, I'll clear out.
I'll be at the computer. See you.
Please come in.
Yes?
We have questions, Mr. Stiller.
Questions for you.
Questions about the Vollmer case.
You were his assistant?
You know full well.
Yes, of course.
Purely routine.
Part of the job.
Once learned you never forget it.
Let me be frank, Mr. Stiller.
It's possible that Vollmer's death was not an accident.
You were away?
I told you, at my cabin in the mountains.
What do you mean, you told me?
Nothing.
Just that I was at my cabin.
Can anyone corroborate that?
No.
Vollmer was my best friend.
You're not doing too badly as technical director at IKZ.
No, not too badly.
I can reach you here, if I need you?
If you need me.
Good-bye, Mr. Stiller.
He was from Homicide.
If anyone makes trouble, I'm here.
The police aren't giving up, that's good.
Lause hinted that Vollmer's death might not have been an accident.
Who's Lause?
The Lause who vanished without a trace at Siskins' party.
Did someone vanish without a trace at Siskins' party?
Probably one of Siskins' harmless jokes.
No doubt, Gloria, no doubt.
A simple hook-up to an identity unit.
Is that alright?
I chose 4388 for you, a truck driver.
Enjoy the ride.
OK, step on it.
Here we go. Be good, and stay out of trouble.
Floor it.
Lousy weather we gave them.
Strange, why's there no traffic?
I don't get it.
Maybe it's Sunday here.
I forgot to ask.
Kid, if I hit you, it won't even cause a short circuit.
What's Walfang done now?
Hey, what's that?
You were lucky, young man.
Just a slight shock.
We nearly saw the last of you.
How's it possible?
Search me. I haven't checked the box yet, but...
But...?
Say it, you have a hunch.
Something exploded.
It can only have been sabotage. lmpossible, with our security.
If it exploded, it must be sabotage.
A computer doesn't just explode!
Sabotage is quite impossible.
IKZ is under our control.
Obviously not.
A technical error, perhaps.
How long will repairs take?
I nearly died, and that's all you say?
You mustn't get excited, you need rest.
Yeah, yeah, OK.
Good-bye, then.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Just doing my job.
I want a thorough investigation.
Check security measures, Edelkern.
If necessary, step them up.
Understand?
Naturally, Mr. Siskins.
Of course.
Mr. Stiller, I think you should go home and rest.
Seriously, how long will repairs take?
Two or three days, no longer.
OK, then...
That's alright.
Eva?
You startled me.
Something wrong?
No.
I was thinking of my father.
Shall we go for a drive?
Just like that.
You know, I need a change of air.
Some of Father's files are still on his desk.
Check if there's anything useful to you.
I'll get ready.
Was anything removed after your father died?
Pardon?
I asked if anything was removed after your father's death.
Questioning me?
Come on, let's go.
Have you seen his drawing since then?
What drawing?
Achilles and the tortoise.
I've never seen it...
Achilles and the tortoise.
I'm going to try to find out how your father really died.
Do you think...?
Maybe.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I don't feel well.
I haven't felt well for a while.
I get dizzy, see things.
Probably, or possibly,
I'm simply overworked.
Want me to drive?
I'll just wait here a bit, then drive you home.
One, two, three, four...
Come in. Fourteen, fifteen.
- Hi, Fritz.
- Hi, Fred.
What's that?
- For my circulation.
- Your circulation?
I've been having dizzy spells.
Better watch it.
Your puppets are dancing.
I contacted 0001 again.
Einstein?
That system failure has him worried.
He's being difficult.
You know, I think that was Vollmer's only major mistake.
What?
The Einstein contact unit.
It wouldn't have worked without him.
We tried everything.
We needed a unit we could contact directly.
Problems were inevitable.
Why?
No one can stand knowing they're artificial.
Obviously.
But if they suffer psychological disorders it shows how successful we've been.
Depends how you see it.
Einstein reported an attempted suicide.
Unbelievable. Who?
7326, Christopher Nobody.
I'll take him out.
He'll screw up the system.
It's inhuman of us, isn't it?
But we have no choice.
OK, delete him, this...
Right. Christopher Nobody.
See you later.
Zeno.
Zeno's paradox!
This is no coincidence.
That must be what Vollmer's drawing meant.
Send me down to see Nobody.
Nobody no longer exists, he's in heaven.
- Don't joke.
- I deprogrammed him. He's gone.
Shit!
Why?
- He must know something...
- Knew ...
Knew something I need.
Hardly likely, Fred.
I programmed him myself.
He was an ordinary unit. Why?
Nothing, Fritz, nothing.
Just an idea.
Let me speak to Einstein, he may know.
Give me a projection link.
OK, I'll call you.
- Where do I meet Einstein?
- In a hotel lobby.
You only have 5 minutes.
You've kept me waiting.
Hello, Einstein.
Is something wrong?
Not often I meet someone from above.
Right now I'm just a bundle of electronic circuits, too.
A projection, if you like.
Shall we sit down?
I only have a few minutes, it's not really worth it.
It's about Christopher Nobody.
You spoke to him.
Why did he try to kill himself?
A whiskey.
He was on the verge of a breakdown.
Why?
He knew.
What did he know?
Somehow he'd found out what he was.
You don't just find that out.
Did you say something?
You know my circuits prohibit it.
Time's running out.
Stiller has to be back in 1 20 seconds.
In 30 seconds we'll signal him.
PHONE CALL FOR MR. STILLER
My time's up.
Good-bye, Einstein.
Come on, show me.
Come on, show me.
Come on, show me.
I can't bear it.
Please, take me with you.
You know that's absurd.
I'll be back.
Let me talk in peace.
We'll meet at 8, Gerda.
In the corner restaurant.
What's the idea, young man?
Where are your manners?
The impertinence!
A light?
Thanks.
Everything OK?
Everything's OK. Except...
I saw Günther Lause.
Sorry, who?
Come with me.
I want to do a test.
Got a minute?
Sure.
OK, I'm looking for an identity unit.
Use the list.
No, let's try a different method.
I'll describe him.
Age?
55. Male. Single.
Engineering degree.
Psychological traits?
He's good-natured.
But stingy. Drinks quite a bit.
Two minutes.
Eva, it's Fred.
Too many. Anything else?
Heavy smoker, gold medallist in sports.
Collects old watches.
That should do it.
Sorry, but...
No, I'm running a test. Listen...
Could you pick me up?
I want to see you.
See you at six.
I've got five.
- That OK?
- I hope so. Their names?
Teiler, Strunz, Kittel
Erdhofer, Lause.
Lause's first name?
Günther.
Günther Lause.
Didn't you just...?
Yes. What number?
Programmer?
Vollmer!
That's fine.
Thanks a lot.
Strange.
DaiIy News!
Mystery Surrounding Super-Computer!
For your own sake, forget everything you've seen.
Or your life's not worth a dime.
DaiIy News!
Mystery Surrounding Super-Computer!
Problems?
Could say that.
Is it about Zeno again?
Or this Lause?
Yes, him too.
You know about the sabotage during my hook-up.
But that a cop who'd interrogated me once forgot, and interrogated me again... that you don't know.
Or that the other night everything, the streets, lights... disappeared for a few seconds... that you don't know.
Nor can you imagine my dizzy spells and depression.
I see.
A street vanished and then reappeared?
Ice or water?
Nothing, thanks.
I've thought a lot about you, Stiller.
I believe... with your new responsibility for the simulation model and the unusual stress of your job you're overworked, psychologically unstable.
Think about it...
Every day you reign like God over a miniature world you helped to create and which you mistake more and more for a real world.
You can add and delete people at will.
This leads to feelings of guilt, depression and fear.
You need to relax, forget it all.
I have to make a call.
What should I do?
You've taken the first step:
You recognize the cause, realize what's happening, are aware of the problem.
If you keep working on yourself, you'll get better and your mental disturbances will go away.
You should take a vacation.
Forget it, especially now.
I don't want Simulacron working exclusively for Hartmann.
I guess I'll be going.
Try to have a little fun now and then.
And stop brooding.
It's not good for you.
Believe me.
I'll try.
Getting in?
Quite a coincidence, isn't it?
It's no coincidence.
Dr. Hahn phoned me.
He thought I could take your mind off things.
It was fine with me.
Me, too.
Now I'm feeling better.
But I won't be manipulated!
Manipulated by whom?
By Siskins.
What do you mean?
I won't be intimidated!
I can be just as pigheaded as Vollmer was.
Vollmer wouldn't let private interests take over his computer.
And I won't, either.
Let Siskins do what he likes.
Isn't Siskins a danger to you?
No, because he needs me.
Let's dance.
Morning, Fred.
Morning, Miss Fromm. Thank you.
Any mail?
Need an aspirin?
Important calls?
But Siskins wants to see you urgently.
Miss Fromm?
Last night I said some pretty crazy things.
Forget them.
Were they all just crazy things?
So, what's up?
I need your help.
We have to do something.
The media are getting impatient.
One question, just to be sure:
Could you convincingly explain our computer to a layman if all of society depended on it?
I have my convictions, and I can present them convincingly.
That's exactly what
I expected you to say.
Send them in.
My colleague, Dr. Stiller, and I have a statement about the simulation model.
Afterwards, we'll offer refreshments.
A misunderstanding has led to the publication of a report in the press that was misleading for the public.
We wish to take the opportunity to dispel this misunderstanding.
Dr. Stiller developed the simulation model together with Professor Vollmer.
Dr. Stiller will say a few words about the new computer system.
Strictly speaking, it isn't a computer in the conventional sense but rather an electronic simulation system with tremendous storage capacity.
As Professor Henri Vollmer put it with this system we achieved the qualitative jump to an autonomous computer.
We've created an artificial miniature world out of circuits, switches, electronic impulses and reflexes.
When fully functional, it will lead a life of its own according to our rules, and with its own dynamics.
Concretely, Dr. Stiller, what does the thing do?
Naturally Dr. Stiller thinks in scientific terms.
If you'd prefer a practical point of view...
I'm at your disposal.
Go on, Dr. Stiller.
We'd like to hear from you.
I'll try.
You have to imagine the inside of our simulation model
- we call it Simulacron - as a reproduction in miniature of our society.
At the moment we have slightly over
9000 so-called identity units each of which has the faculties of perception, thought memory, imagination and so forth of a real human being.
With Simulacron, we have in a word, a tiny universe identical to our own.
Into this universe we can introduce certain impulses which...
- I'm coming back to your question - impulses which lead to highly specific reactions.
Reactions... that precisely replicate human reactions.
20 years in the future.
This means we can use
Simulacron to avoid the mistakes we'd make in that period.
For example...
We can, to be extremely concrete use Simulacron to learn consumer habits 20 years from now... how housing needs will evolve which transportation modes will become obsolete and which ones will be in use.
Then you could also calculate if in 20 years we'll need more steel or plastics.
Yes, of course.
In time manufacturers will have access to this data to avoid socially unproductive investments.
What do you mean, "in time"?
As you are aware, our research project is state-initiated and sponsored.
We do not define its mandate.
Our sole mission is to carry out government policy.
There are questions about your relationship to United Steel.
There are always questions.
That's why you do research... to find answers.
Here, in our Institute, we seek to devote our energies to designing a better new, more humane and equitable world to meet the hopes and dreams of Mr. Stiller and us all.
Now, a snack.
What's your true relationship to Hartmann?
Mr. Hartmann is a friend.
A good friend.
In private, Mr. Rupp, only in private.
Hahn's advice from the other day...
I think it helped.
At least I know what's wrong with me.
I'm sure you'll be better soon.
About the other night,
I'm truly sorry.
I was out of it.
Hahn called it "paranoia".
He's probably right.
I'll be so happy when everything's OK.
Yes, and... now with all the coverage in the papers, the TV and so on...
I just hope he's painted himself into a corner. And you?
I hope you're right.
Please excuse me.
Of course.
See you sometime.
Say something!
She's not there.
Could I have a light?
Now she's disappeared, like Lause.
Lause disappeared too, and everyone's forgotten him.
Except me...
He's in my head and he refuses to come out.
My Eva... my darling little Eva.
They'll forget you too.
But in my head, she'll stay there.
I mean... my head's a funny head.
There are things in it that don't go in any other head.
Good morning, Mr. Stiller.
Good morning, Miss Fromm.
Aspirin?
One second.
I tried to reach you all last night.
Me?
Siskins wants you.
Where were you?
Were you with Eva Vollmer?
You should go see Siskins right away. It's important.
- It's Stiller.
- Send him in.
Morning, Stiller.
Aren't you a sight!
A night on the town, I bet.
Have a seat.
What's up?
I wanted to introduce a new addition to your staff.
I believe you know him.
A top-notch fellow.
He sent me his résumé and
I didn't want to lose him.
That will be him.
Come in.
Mark Holm.
Hello.
Hello, Mark.
Mr. Holm can join your team immediately.
Where'd you work before?
The Trau Institute, but...
Isn't that a subsidiary of United Steel?
It is, Fred.
Thanks, I was just curious.
My God, Eva!
Where were you?
I searched the entire house for you!
Hold on.
Thank you.
- So where were you?
- At home, of course.
I fell asleep on the couch.
You just didn't see me.
- I searched every...
- It doesn't matter.
I wanted to apologize for running away. I love you.
I'm happy. I've thought it over,
I'm not worried anymore.
I need you, Eva.
Yes. Ciao.
I've been looking for you.
How's it going?
- A cigarette?
- God no!
I hate it.
Mark Holm's been nosing around.
I'm going to hook-up with Einstein.
I want to know what's going on with him.
Like to come?
No, not today.
See you later.
Fritz, what's wrong?
Nothing, Mr. Stiller, it's nothing.
You're not Fritz Walfang.
You're Einstein.
My God, what is this?
Let me go, please!
Don't send me back.
It's my only chance.
I want to be a human being.
And I will.
This is the first step.
I'll make the next one, too.
Into the real world.
What do you mean?
This is the real world.
Still want your beer?
That's what you think.
But the truth is this world, which you take for reality, is only a simulation model of the real world.
Fred Stiller, the big computer boss...
You're nothing but a mass of electrical circuits.
The identity unit Fred Stiller.
You're a number, like everyone here.
A number in a research laboratory.
Admittedly, in a highly advanced one.
Professor Vollmer knew it.
That's why he had to die.
And now you know.
It can't be, Einstein.
Tell me it's not true.
WORLD ON A WIRE
Subtitles: Robert Gray, Kinograph
World War III, hot and cold, lasted from...
Hold.
Female.
Rover pack has her, 125 yards.
Solo, waiting to move in, 75 yards.
No!
Keep away from me!
Help!
Maniacs! Stop it!
Help! No!
No!
- Say it again!
- No!
Say that again, you bitch!
Hey, did you see her jerk when I cut her?
Hold, one more.
You're still constantly overreacting.
I've absolutely no idea how I've managed to keep you alive so long.
I wouldn't bother going down in there, unless your taste has changed radically.
They left an ugly mess.
- I said they left a mess!
- I heard you.
Pearls before swine.
All my directives go completely unregarded.
Sometimes you're just as ignorant as any other common rover.
One indication of a female alone and it's caution to the wind, the eyes glaze, the glands swell, and the brain freezes.
I can't see a thing in there.
Smell it!
I thought you were doing all the scouting today, Vic.
Damn it Blood, don't give me a hard time, smell it!
It's clean.
Ain't that a shame.
Hell, they didn't have to cut her.
She could have been used three or more times.
War is hell.
All right. Run it again.
You're so funny when you're sexually frustrated.
I'm funny enough to kick you upside the butt!
I said find, and I ain't kidding.
One does not say ain't, Albert.
Simply say I'm not kidding.
Fine, dog meat.
And stop calling me Albert.
And you would stone a poor defenseless animal, wouldn't you?
Yes, I can tell that would.
I can tell by your short breath and your disgusting aggressive behavior that you would.
And that's because you're not a nice person, Albert.
You're not a nice person at all.
Do I gawk at you when you're working?
I'll locate a female if there is one.
You go look for food.
I detect no living female person within my range, sir.
I have sniffed and I have cast and I have a negative reading.
However I'd be delighted to tell you a suggestive story, if you think that would help.
Pass, fuzzy-butt.
A cautious young fella named Lodge had seatbelts installed in his Dodge.
When his date was strapped in, he committed a sin without even leaving the garage.
That's clever, isn't it?
Let's see, from March 1953 to June...
Albert, you have all the cranial capacity of a canary.
Now, I'm going to recount these events of historical significance once again.
Now, please, please try to assimilate them this time.
World War III, hot and cold, lasted from June 1950 to March 1983, when the Vatican armistice was signed between the Eastern and Western blocs, a total of 33 years.
Is this too fast for you?
- No, I'm right with you.
- Oh, good.
Now World War IV lasted five days, just long enough for the final missiles to leave their silos on both sides.
What's left here where once were homes and families with warm hearths...
Come on, teats! Would you get off my back, you mad dog?
Now only desolation, civilization lies smothered and decaying under an ocean of mud, belonging to anyone who's strong enough to dig and fight and take it for his own.
God, that's dramatic, I like that.
So, spread about us, the city of Phoenix, Arizona, where in 2006, 18-odd years ago, you managed to come into the world and we became associates.
Now, let's hear that back.
Now let's run through the modern presidents.
What good's all this history crap gonna do me?
Just do the Presidents.
Oh, God.
- Eisenhower, Truman...
- Truman, Eisenhower.
Truman, Eisenhower...
Kennedy... Johnson...
Nixon... Ford...
Kennedy... Kennedy... Kennedy...
Your continued narrow-minded refusal to believe in Over The Hill is possibly costing us a better life, you know.
Over The Hill, my ass.
Well, when do we start looking for it again?
- Soon as I get my heart started.
- I mean let's stop the crap.
I know what you mean: Over the Hill, where the deer and the antelope play and it's warm and clean and we can relax and have fun.
Man, they grow food right out of the ground.
- How do like that pipe dream?
- It's called farming.
Oh, I believe you.
And they also have a great crop of clothes and guns and gorgeous chicks.
You're gonna tell me how you saw the whole wonderful thing with your baby blues.
Never said I saw it,
I said I heard about it.
And from who?
From whom, and you know from whom.
And whom the hell's gonna believe a police dog?
I'm sorry, Blood.
I believe you about Over the Hill.
Hell, I believe anything you tell me.
And even if we don't know for sure, it's worth checking on, right?
- Right?
- Whatever you say.
And we will go, just like I promised.
Right now I'm hungry and I wanna get laid.
So find me a broad, and we'll go to the promised land.
That's what you always say.
I know, I know, but I mean it this time.
Find me a chick and we'll go.
I'm hungry.
So am I!
I tell you what. You go find a chick, and I'll hustle us up some food.
I'm hungry.
You already said that, god damn it, and I just said...
I can't do good work when I'm hungry.
You ain't pulling that crap on me again!
And you can shove that part about how you lost the ability to hunt for food when you learned how to talk!
Oh, hell, all you're good for is finding hard, stringy scumbags that are just liable to cut off my goddamn...
No food, no females.
Okay, you just sit there on your fluffy butt while I do all the goddamn work!
But I'll tell you one goddamn thing, you better do some practicing.
It's been six weeks since I been laid, and it sure as hell ain't been that long since you ate.
By God, it damn well may be if you don't start producing.
Here, right! Here, right!
Heave! Heave away!
Pull! Pull!
Hey, there, pull on that line!
Pull on it, there!
Get out there! Dig!
Dig, you suckers!
Get that dirt outta there.
Must be something special.
They got the whole bunch.
You get up and get in that hole.
Get up!
You get yourself up, or you ain't never gonna get up!
How'd Fellini know there'd be a house here?
'Cause he's smarter, that's how!
Wonder why they hang around him?
Probably just charisma.
Hey, there!
You dig.
Move your foot if you don't want any...!
Hey, watch were you throw that crap!
Dig!
Hey!
Play!
Play "Melancholy Baby"!
God, I wish he'd tune that.
Well?
I don't know. Checked out
Cracker Jack to here.
Think he just might do.
Maybe.
- Get that out of there.
- Look at that!
Keep your hands off of that.
Now get away from there.
Look at all that food.
- I'll knock your stupid head in.
- You and who else?
Just me!
Boy!
I need shoes!
Anybody see some shoes?
Dig! Dig, you pigs!
Get down in there and dig.
This place ought to be loaded.
Get it out of there.
Might work.
We'll wait like we always do.
To hell with waiting.
Vic, come back here!
Get away from here!
Help! He's takin' our bag!
Help, help, help, help!
Get back down in here, you idiots, get back in here.
- Leave him go.
- We got him, didn't we, Blood?
Oh, shut up and keep running!
At least he's got some guts.
Now, dig in there!
Get out of there and guard that wagon.
- Now watch him take it out on us!
- Run, boy!
Come back any time, though.
Dig, you suckers!
That's our boy.
Put out the cheese.
What do you want to do tonight?
Oh, doesn't really matter to me.
Whatever you'd like to do,
Albert... Vic.
Well, now that we're loaded,
I guess we could hit The Turf.
Yes, we could do that.
- Well, if you'd rather not.
- Oh, no, no, no, that'd be fine.
We could probably even afford a little pop... popcorn.
Mat's good for the rifle.
Put it in the water there.
They're getting wet there, move them over. Goes to rust fast.
Move on along.
You money-grabbing toad, you move my stuff over!
Move his heat. We don't want no trouble tonight.
If it picks up one rust spot, you're going to wake up with a crowd around you.
- Sardines...
- We could use some!
- What about the mutt?
- He ain't no mutt.
You wanna see the movies or don't you?
Peaches.
How the hell am I supposed to know that?
You can read, can't you?
Peaches for the dog.
Beets are better for him anyway.
Seen a screamer 'bout a mile out.
Which way's he headed?
Think I'd stick around to find out?
I said screamers.
- I want popcorn.
- Pass.
- You said we'd get some.
- You said.
Come on, Albert, buy me some popcorn.
I'm tapped.
You can live without it.
You're just being an ass.
You remember that next time you want to call me Albert.
I hope the next time you play with yourself, you go blind.
Come on, let's sit down front.
Sit down!
Get your ass over there,
I want to sit here.
How can you enjoy a show without popcorn?
All right, tightwad, watch the master at work.
Charity is a thing of the past.
Say, Mark, you got a grease rag handy?
He shot my brother, we all know that!
Now, about my brother!
He just got here!
He's right over there!
We can't have that lunatic runnin' loose, I tell you!
Now, how 'bout that, men?
Sheriff doesn't come,
I don't know what he'll do.
There's a female in here.
You're nuts.
I tell you, she's in here.
Where?
Where is she?
Wait a minute.
Come on out here.
I want to talk to you.
Lying egg sucker, I ought to kick your tail up around your ears.
Expect me to believe that you can whiff her when there ain't no other dog in the whole joint that's caught her yet?
Now you forget my infallibility,
Albert, that's foolish.
No I didn't forget,
I just don't believe it.
Where is she?
Knock it off!
How the hell can I see the picture?
- Get 'em out of here!
- Sic the dogs on 'em!
Turn up the sound!
Okay, all right, I was dumb.
You taught me all I know.
I believe everything you say.
That wasn't her, was it?
Come on. She might get away.
I'll buy you the popcorn.
Bottom line, you're a brain with an educated nose and there's no other canine in your class.
She's dressed like a solo, wearing a knit cap.
Where's the kid?
He's spending the night with Johnny Lambert.
Oh, please, take me now.
Come on, get up. Not yet, guys.
Damn it, Johnny, try!
Look what I found.
Okay? Which way'd she go?
To the right.
Come on.
That's it for tonight.
Shut her down.
That stupid broad.
She's in there where the screamers hole up.
They're not in there now.
She's alone.
Screamers.
Damn it.
How in the hell am I going to nail her in there?
Simple. Stop shaking like a leaf and go do it.
You sure it's clean?
Albert, have I ever lied to you?
I'm gonna go over there, and
I'm gonna get one of them mats.
You make one move off there and I'll shoot your leg right out from under you, and you'll still get it except you'll be without a leg.
Well, what are you looking at?
What's your name?
- Vic.
- Vic what?
Just Vic.
Then what are your mother and father's names?
Boy, are you a dumb broad.
I told you to stop looking at me like that or I'll bust your teeth out.
Now get that stuff off.
What's your name?
Quilla June Holmes.
That's a weird name.
It's not. My mother says it's not that unusual back in Oklahoma.
That where your folks come from?
Before the war.
They must be pretty old by now.
They are, but they're okay, I guess.
Guess we'd better...
- Now what?
- Rover pack. Twenty-three strong.
They got the building surrounded.
Great, some other mutt must have smelled her in the theater.
Who are you talking to?
- Him.
- The dog?
Give them the girl.
We dig in and stand them off.
They don't know about us. Just give
'em the girl, let's get outta here.
We stay. Now you got any helpful suggestions?
Yes, pull up your pants, Romeo.
Now would you listen to reason?
There's too many of them for us.
You're gonna get us all shot up.
Damn fool!
One way out of here.
Boxed in, that's no good.
Out there in the big room, that's the place.
Oh, Jesus. They'll probably come down the ladder.
What's the matter, don't you talk to strangers?
Shut up will you! I can see it.
Do you understand me?
If we can take one down and get his heat...
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Shut up!
Lovely odds we're up against, aren't they?
You were right.
Let's set up for them.
And I'm right about this simpering female.
Forget that. Now, how do you figure the fight?
You would too, if you figured to stir screamers.
Go on, we'll back ya'!
Over there!
Hey!
He's moving again!
Get off me! Get away!
Where'd she go?
Good or bad first?
Bad.
All right, they didn't come down the ladder as I anticipated, and since they found other ways in, we've lost the element of surprise.
There's no way we can handle them.
And the good?
Let the seven dwarfs have Snow White and we can get out of here with all our parts.
Over my dead body.
They're working on that right now.
- Screamers.
- Where? I don't hear 'em.
Now, what would everyone do if they heard one right now?
Run like a sonofabitch.
It's worth a try.
Screamer!
You hear that?
Screamers!
Go on, damn it, get out of the way!
Make certain they've gone, Vic.
Don't stick your empty head out, Vic.
Hey, easy...
Will you shut her up?
I can't hear myself think.
Get something green.
Get her skirt.
Wrap it around a stick and wave it up there.
Shine her flashlight up through it.
Have they gone?
What do you see?
They are whipped!
We did it!
I'd have given a whole sack full of potatoes to see the look on their faces when they ran!
Hey, Blood we did it, we did it!
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.
They might still be out there.
Just pull back a little.
Wait till daylight, then we'll see.
Okay. Well, I'll take the chick in.
She's right below us.
You stupid nit! You wanna run into one of 'em?
You think I'm bad? Well you wait till you see one of them.
What are they?
I don't know.
I just know you stay away from them.
What?
Easy.
'Cause if one of 'em touches you, you're dead, green dead.
The real thing! Move!
- Come on.
- Where are you?
By the boiler.
The insulation might help.
Where are we going, Vic.
What is it? Why are we...?
Shut up, and hang on to me.
Hurry it up.
Help me up there.
Yes, this'll do.
Clumsy.
I wonder how many mattresses are in here.
Screamers certainly wouldn't want to be confined.
Albert! Tell this to keep its hands to itself!
Maybe somebody else hid in here.
Get yer...
Oh, well, somewhat of a weak call I bet.
- Catch anything yet?
- We're all right so far.
You be able to tell when they leave?
Yes, I'll be able to tell.
If they leave.
Just take it easy.
Everything's going to be all right.
That is, if we don't get choked off in here.
Can you handle it?
Oh, yes, Massa Vic,
I can handle it.
Breeding is an ugly thing.
Long enough for the final missiles to leave their silos on both sides.
Let's see. That was in 2006.
2007. It only lasted 5 days.
You're awfully smart to know all that history.
Well, Blood helps... a little.
Haven't you ever been down under?
- Nope.
- Why?
- It's very nice.
- I heard how nice.
From a solo who raided one.
Well, it's very nice, and you'd like it.
- Bullshit!
- That's very crude.
I'm very crude.
Not all the time.
Listen, ass, I grabbed you and I drug you down here.
So what's so good about me?
I didn't mind. I liked it.
You want to do it again?
Well, I've never seen no... no chick like you before!
Hey, I'm the... I'm the one that's supposed to wanna... do it.
Once more into the breech, dear friend.
Copula: Something that connects.
Copulate: From the Latin copulatus, to engage in...
Honey, it's good to just watch you.
Your waist falls in.
And your hips out, to have you right in my hands.
Just want to talk.
I'm not going to keep pretending I am asleep, Albert.
Oh, boy, you're a bloody mess.
Well, you're not exactly a rose garden yourself.
We'll get out of here yet.
Seems clear.
I'd better go have a look.
Think you can... think you can handle it in your condition?
Can I handle it in my condition?
I can handle several hours on the rack to extricate myself from this disgusting display.
Blood!
No sacrifice is too great.
No, I throw myself gladly into the very jaws of the screaming, grim death.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Blood?
- Yeah.
He... he just feels bad.
He likes you a lot.
- He told me so.
- He did really?
That's nice, 'cause I...
I think he's cute.
How do you do it?
- What?
- Talk to him.
I don't know,
I never thought about it.
Just talk.
Well, how come I can't hear him?
He said something one time.
It's 'cause we had a feeling for each other or something.
What do you mean, like love?
I guess.
I don't know.
He said we thought alike.
I don't know.
Well, anyway...
We'll get a nice little place... and we'll spend a lot of time together alone... and we'll do whatever we feel like doing, and when Blood comes to visit, he can have his own room.
What are you talking about?
Well, I don't exactly think he's going to fit in Down Under.
No way!
I know, that's what I said.
No, I mean, no way
I'm going down there.
Why?
I'm going to be there.
No, you're not.
We'll make it up here, the three of us.
Vic, now I live there.
- If you love me...
- I don't care!
Come out here right now.
Vic, we need to talk.
What the hell's lumbering you?
Your headlong plunge into stupidity.
Last night was inexcusable.
Leaving her for the pack, that would have been the intelligent thing to do!
I wanted her.
Yeah, I know you wanted her about half a hundred times.
And why we still hanging around?
I want her some more!
Well, listen, my friend, I want to get rid of this pain in my side and I want to get away from here.
The screamers could come back any time, you know.
What the hell you worried about that for?
We can handle all that.
That don't mean she can't go with us.
Go with us? Are you out of your small mind?
What good is she? It's all we can do to feed ourselves, as it is.
You know, you're starting to sound like a goddamn poodle!
And you're starting to sound like a jackass.
Sorry.
Oh, Blood, come on.
Hey, man.
It'll still be 50/50 with you and me.
I mean, hell, I owe you.
Don't try that hackneyed ruse on me.
Oh, come on, I just meant like that time that... that old screamer made a grab for me.
You know, that righteous tone green he was too, all glowing like a fungus, and oozing and eyelashes...
Boy.
Made a grab for me, and you went for him.
Could have been burned bad, too, I'll tell you that, and died.
That'd have been all of it for you, right?
Now get that dramatic catch out of your voice and tell me how she's gonna carry her share of the load up here.
Tell me how we're gonna fight off...
All right, okay, okay, just don't hang her.
Harangue, not hang her.
I don't care whatever the hell it is, just knock off the crap or we can forget the whole stinkin' arrangement.
Well, maybe we should, you simple, dumb putz.
What the hell's a putz?
What's a putz?
Is that something bad?
I'll bet it is. It's something bad.
I'll tell you, you better watch your stinking mouth or I'm going to kick you in the butt!
Definitely a putz.
"Don't mean she can't go with us."
I told she was no good.
Okay, okay.
I just don't like being made to feel guilty.
I'm gonna do right by you.
I'd highly recommend that, considering there are several very knowledgeable solos around town who'd be delighted to work with an accomplished female provider like myself.
I also don't like being threatened!
It's not a threat, that's a fact.
No, that's a good way to get that other leg broke.
Don't take your petty frustrations out on me, Albert.
I locate females,
I don't guarantee their behavior.
- What the hell's that?
- How should I know?
Well, smell it!
It's probably ID of some kind she used to get out of the Down Under.
Now we're in a big hurry.
Now, if you'd listened to me last night instead of...
Wait a minute.
You're not thinking of following that...
You... you listen to me, Albert!
You... you'll get killed out there!
Albert. Albert. You come back here!
You idiot, you can't go down there.
You listen to me.
Just because some stinking female knocked you in the head and bruised your ego, there's no reason to become a careless juvenile.
You stop this instant, Albert!
- Vic. Egg-sucker.
- All right. Vic, please, now...
Please stop a minute, please.
I don't know what to say, how to make you understand.
You're not... you're not thinking clearly.
You can't go down there and... and ever hope to come back, and she knows it.
Down Unders hate solos.
Enough rover packs have raided down there and raped their women and stolen their food, and they'll have their defenses up and catch you and kill you.
What the hell do you care?
Always saying you'd be better of without me, anyway.
Forget about her, Vic. Let her go.
Let's... let's look for Over the Hill, or...
If you're tired of me, find another partner somewhere, but whatever you do, don't follow her down there.
I got to, Blood.
I got to.
Hasn't occurred to you how convenient this whole operation has been?
How easy she was to spot and follow, and how she cooperated?
Just think about it, Vic, instead of walking right into their hands.
God knows what they'll do with you.
We've been together long time, good and bad, but... this could be the worst. I'm scared.
I'm scared you won't come back and I'll have to find some rover to take me on.
You know most rovers are in packs now, and I'm not that young anymore.
And I'll miss you, Vic.
I'll really miss you.
Well...
Try to get back as quick as I can.
Will you wait?
For a while, then Over the Hill.
Take care of yourself.
Do my best.
I'll catch up with you.
Sure.
So long... partner.
And with these terrifying sounds of primeval savagery, we close the Committee's presentation of sound tours into the past.
Today, chapter 3:
Africa, the dark continent.
Tomorrow, chapter 4: Alaska.
Michael, yellow reference, a malfunction.
Level 10, op section 6.
Repeat, yellow reference.

Another helpful hint for living, from the Committee's almanac.
It is exactly 10 a.m.
On this Wednesday,
June 29, Year of Our Lord one-aught-three.
The Committee has decided...
May I have the chicken salad, please?
Excuse me, please.
A little mustard.
Thank you.
The Committee, sitting in Awards and Punishments session, committed to all;
Attendance discretionary.
One hour.
Repeat: One hour.
Be it resolved therefore that Mrs. Eunice Long has been declared the blue ribbon winner of the annual Topeka canning festival, and that throughout the Year of Our Lord one-aught-three, all preserved peaches, be they canned and/or jarred, shall bear her likeness and the inscription "Topeka Queen."
Michael, green reference.
Hydroponic laboratory, number 173.
Fanny and Jurdan MacBurnatt.
Saturation of nutrient solution.
Repeat: Green reference.
This is the best the architects could do.
Pencil.
Why are they here?
Lack of respect. Wrong attitude.
Failure to obey authority.
- Lectures?
- Three.
- Cut-and-dry, then.
- I'd say so.
That'll do it.
Fanny and Jurdan MacBurnatt.
Any reason to be easy?
Look, when we... put this in, see, then we'll add that.
We find it almost impossible to believe that you have ignored several warnings by us to conform to the rules that are vital to the continued growth and well-being of our beloved Topeka, but you did.
Defiance of this Committee, duly elected and ordained by the people, will not be tolerated.
The Farm, both of 'em.
Now how'd the last farms go, Mez?
Cancer, I think.
No, no, no.
Let me see.
I have it down here.
Let's see. Oh, no, it was an accident with farm machinery, that's what it was.
Larry and Linda Lacey,
March 17 of this year.
Let's make these... heart attacks.
Yeah, grief from the Committee.
Doc'll do the eulogy.
Services at Lakeside Methodist, the usual.
And may God have mercy on your souls.
Now that's the way to build a cotton gin.
Quilla June!
Honey! Come to papa.
Sure is pleasing to see you back home again.
Didn't have any trouble?
Everything went all right.
- Didn't have any trouble?
- No, sir.
That's fine, fine.
Sure did yourself proud, missy.
The Committee won't forget it, no siree!
Then I'll be put on the Committee right away, like we talked about.
Don't you worry about it, little girl, soon as there's an opening.
Mr. Craddock,
I would prefer not to wait.
After all, I did bring Vic down here exactly like you told me to.
Now you just be patient, Quilla June.
Have fun with the young folks your own age.
Think about getting married, making a home.
Your time will come.
I'd rather be just like you, Miss Mez.
And not wait.
Don't you worry, little girl.
- I don't see why you just...
- That'll be all, that'll be all.
That young lady's going to be trouble.
Always has been.
Any reason for her to change?
Maybe you should have gone to three.
Little childish plotting doesn't bother me none.
Long as it stays little.
Mez... see that she's one of the recipients.
Then marry her off to Hiram and Edna's boy. What's his name?
- Charles.
- Charlie, yeah.
If that don't cool her ambitions, farm her out.
Horse manure.
He knew I wanted on that Committee.
Stupid, stinkin' old rotter, Lou!
I am bristling!
That is the only reason
I went along with their dumb plan.
America, the land of plenty, was the world's greatest agricultural...
- They promised me.
- Promised?
Capable not only of feeding its own hardworking...
Well, they hinted.
Then they tried to shoo me off without a by-your-leave, so I pushed.
Well, you shouldn't have.
I mean, they're gonna be watching us now.
Gery, I don't care.
I am so sick and tired...
The Farm.
The poor, who accepted our Christian desire to aid our brothers across the seas...
You're right.
I do care.
Okay.
I'm going to smile, and I'm going to curtsy the right time to all the right people,
'cause it ain't going to be much longer.
The Psalms of David will not wait even for you, Quilla June Holmes.
- That is your class...
- Yes, Mrs. Cammock.
Old pigeon feet.
I'm sorry.
I'll be right there, ma'am.
See you later.
He and Vic were in the park together,
I turned my back for just a sec...
What'd you and Vic talk about?
- Come on, we want to know.
- Well, Lou.
He's still a little confused.
Yeah, good.
Now, how about it boy?
I mean, we're gonna find out anyway, so... why don't you just tell us and it'll make it easier on all of us?
What do you say?
How about it boy?
The Farm, immediately.
Grandmother's Conrad's recipe for rhubarb marmalade.
Let me go!
Orange juice and lemon juice...
What did the exam show?
Well, the usual cold virus.
A little high blood pressure, to be expected under these conditions.
There no infection. He's well developed, reasonably well nourished.
Intelligent average.
Emotional responses simplistic.
Most marked finding is his overtly aggressive behavior.
In other words, he's extremely physical, as you may have noticed.
- Well, now son.
- Suck wind, wet brain.
Better be nice, boy.
I hope all your stinking kids are harelipped.
- Michael.
- All right.
Better behave yourself.
Along with many other organisms... that somehow managed to stay alive up above, you have been studied, observed.
Unobtrusively, of course.
Living habits, common sense, tenacity, physical prowess.
Out of the many, you have been chosen... led down here by...
Quilla June!
To be the recipient of an honor...
You know, she's a scumbag!
Watch your foul mouth, boy.
When anybody on the Committee speaks, you just keep still and listen.
Hey, how would like to have a rifle rammed up your butt?
- Michael!
- All right, all right!
You show respect, boy.
As I was saying.
To be the recipient of an honor that occurs but once in several decades.
Now, Mez... let me have the original
Elders Proclamation, will you?
"The fruit of your loins will enable the productive citizenry of Topeka"
"to overcome metabolic changes resulting from" lengthy subterranean living,
"allow it to keep its leadership in the drive to remake this sinful world in God's own image."
See, we've been underground too long.
Our woman can't get pregnant.
Every once in a while, we need new blood.
We... need a new man.
"We are never so happy, nor so unhappy...
- A new man.
- "As we imagine."
Another helpful hint for living, from the Committee's almanac.
Special kind of man.
You mean you want me to knock up your broads?
You talked me into it.
Line 'em up!
You first, honey.
Take your hands off me!
Guide them together, we beseech thee, in the way of righteousness and peace that loving and serving thee with one heart and mind all the days of their life, they may be abundantly enriched with the tokens of thy everlasting favor. Amen.
By authority vested in me by the Committee,
I hereby pronounce you husband and wife,
According to the ordinances and the laws of the State of Topeka.
What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
Amen.
"A man should never be ashamed to own
"he has been in the wrong,
"which is but saying that he is wiser today than he was yesterday."
Another helpful hint for living from the Committee's almanac.
Mez, you wouldn't have a little something to help a well-used throat?
And be sure to get both parents to sign right here.
Now, let's see Brother Hexler.
Michael, amber reference.
Air intake fan number 12, shaft 17B indicates heat buildup.
Repeat: Amber reference.
Chapter One, verse twenty-two, Mayor.
God blessed them and said be fruitful and multiply.
God blessed them and lets them be.
You almost asked yourself out of this honor, young lady.
Sir?
The Committee.
Oh, well, I'm sure the Committee knows best.
Where are your parents?
Miss Mez said it would be all right.
They must have come down with something,
'cause they're sure not feeling well.
Shall we keep the schedule?
Dearly beloved...
Brother Hexler.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to see...
Vic, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?
They made me do it. You gotta understand, they made me do it.
They started it.
Don't you give me that
"I'm sorry" bullshit.
You're as crazy as the rest of these damn nuts.
Keep your voice down!
They may be stupid, but they're not dumb like you.
Oh, no? They bring me down here to make babies and then hook me up to this stupid machine? That's real smart.
Population control, Vic, in case you haven't heard of it.
Thirty-five girls are impregnated and then you are killed, you understand?
We don't have idiots like you running around the place.
So you wiggled your little butt... and teased me down here to their big wealth.
I had to! They said kill me if I didn't. Listen!
Next. Next, please.
No, ladies, I want you to be sure to put your name here.
His name goes here.
And there's another thing
I want you to make very sure of on this most solemn and joyous...
I'm gonna run Topeka.
You and me.
Maybe some others.
We'll be the Committee.
Do anything we want, any time we want.
We'll have them bow and scrape for a change.
Just by springing me?
Yeah, and getting rid of the Committee.
Okay, where's my heat?
What?
My guns, where's my guns?
In the Committee office.
How you got it figured?
Okay.
Right out this door to the right is Michael.
There's a crowd there.
If we run through the crowd, they'll come unglued, and right to the right again, big doors... through the doors, we have help outside.
Don't panic.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way, you fools!
God damn it.
Another helpful hint for living from the Committee's almanac.
The guns are to the right.
Come on, what happened?
Well, how'd it come out?
They folded, like I said they would.
Hey, listen, Michael's got to be first.
And Jeb, not Wilson, or we're all in trouble.
And then the faint thunder became an uproar.
The winds changed to a great vibration of air.
Then Lou, then Mez.
Then Doc. But kill Lou first,
'cause he's the important one.
Where you going?
The church is this way.
Hey, we got to get them when they're together.
- Where you going?
- I'm getting the hell out of here.
I want to see Blood again.
I want to get in a good, straightforward fight with some sonofabitch over a can of beans.
I gotta get back in the dirt so I feel clean!
Wait a minute. Helping you has put us out into the open.
- You've got to help us.
- Good luck, baby.
Vic, please. You dirty, filthy, stinking, rotten animal!
You stupid animal!
You think I'd let you slobber all over me and paw me so's you could walk out now?
I didn't bring you down here so they could use you.
I brought you down here so I could use you.
Now, you better kill them, then I don't care what you do!
Please! No, don't!
Please don't!
Please help me!
I love you, I love you!
I only said that because you were going to leave me.
Please, Vic!
12-inch skillets, preferably of the non-stick variety.
Fry the bacon until brown, but not too crisp, then set it aside to drain.
Pour off all but two tablespoons...
I don't understand you.
All you can think about is going back up there, and about your dog.
It's like all the time we spent together didn't mean anything to you.
Vic, I don't see what's wrong with staying down here and running the Committee.
Add the corned beef...
There they are. Kill them, Vic, and everything down here is ours.
Two tablespoons of chopped parsley and add cream.
You'd be given plenty of food, fools to kick around.
We can do whatever we please!
And add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste...
Kill them, Vic, now.
Red reference.
Repeat: Red... red reference.
For us.
The Committee.
- Do it!
- The Committee... sitting in extraordinary session,
July 4, Year of Our Lord one-aught-three, all present.
Bestow upon the Committee, thy servants of the seal, thine approval and thy fatherly benediction, granting unto them grace to fulfill with pure and steadfast affection the ordinances and the laws of the State of Topeka.
Amen.
You have ignored several warnings by us informed of the rules that are vital to the continued growth and well-being of our beloved Topeka.
And ordained by the people cannot be tolerated.
- Quilla June.
- Quilla June Holmes.
Number 2,644.
Lack of respect, wrong attitude, failure to obey authority.
How say you one and all?
- Aye.
- Aye.
- Aye.
- The Farm, immediately.
Gery.
Gery Leroy Franklin, number 2,598.
Lack of respect, wrong attitude, failure to obey authority.
How say you one and all?
- Aye.
- Aye.
The Farm, immediately.
Richard.
Number 2,601.
All right.
Vic, I'll show you the way out.
Let's get out of here.
- Vic.
- The Farm, immediately.
I'll show you the way out.
All right, I'll show you the way out.
- Kenneth.
- Please, let's just get out of here.
I'll take care of you and Blood.
I'll do anything you want to do.
Vic, remember in the boiler room?
Wrong attitude, failure to obey authority.
How say you one and all?
Aye.
First thing that boy's ever done.
A shame.
Vic, please, let's get out of here.
Same. Farm. Immediately.
And may God have mercy on your soul.
Heat the bacon fat reserved in the skillet.
Add the hash, and with a spatula, spread evenly...
Cook uncovered over moderate heat for 35 to 40 minutes, scraping the pan occasionally to prevent the hash from sticking.
As it cooks, remove any excess fat from the top and sides of the pan with a spoon or bulb baster.
Kill him! Oh, please, kill him!
Vic, kill him!
Number two-six-aught-one, and Gery Leroy Franklin...
Let's get on with it. Jack?
Of the 35 proposed recipients,
10 have been serviced.
We need another donor, of course.
What's wrong? Why don't you kill him, Vic?
Put the search program back in effect.
Scratch the boy's name.
Concentrate on the rest of the list.
Whichever one we pick, make sure we have better security.
Then place a large round platter over the skillet and, gripping platter and skillet firmly together...
Stop him, Vic, stop him.
If any of the hash sticks to the pan, lift it up with the spatula...
We've got to keep him in check.
Now, I've been talking and talking and talking about this, and... and serve with poached eggs, if desired.
Come on! Come on, Vic, come on!
Hurry!
One cup diced, cooked vegetables...
Let's... get another Michael out of the warehouse.
This time, make sure the engineering department wipes that smile off his face.
Four tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley... one quarter cup heavy cream, salt, and freshly ground, black pepper.
Blood?
Blood!
You kept me down there too long.
Come on with me, let's go.
Over The Hill, that's where he went, and we need him.
Well, let's catch up with him.
I don't know where it is.
If Blood knows, why didn't he tell you?
Vic!
Blood.
Vic!
Blood?
- Blood!
- Hello, partner.
Blood, we made it back.
Who's your new tailor, Albert?
How long's it been since you ate?
I grabbed a lizard yesterday.
Maybe it was the day before.
I can't seem to remember.
Well, we got to leg it into town and get you something to eat fast.
No, Fellini's taken everything over.
Slaughtered every solo who wouldn't join him.
The whole town's under their control.
You can't get any food there.
You can't even go back at all.
Okay, just take it easy.
I can't take it any other way.
I'm almost gone.
You'd better just leave and find someplace you can stay alive.
How about Over The Hill, Tiger?
I can't make it the way I am now.
But you might be able to.
He needs food and he needs medicine.
We've got to get it fast,
'cause we can't make it without him.
We're too late, darling.
There's nothing we can do about it now.
Vic, we've got to get out of here.
We're gonna be together.
He'd want us to be together.
Now, I love you.
If you love me, you'll come on, too.
You haven't eaten a bite.
I'm not hungry.
I really appreciate this.
Well, let's press on.
Now, where were you?
Oh, yes, in the hospital.
Oh, Blood, come on.
You know, if they'd just let you have your way with the blushing brides instead of hooking you up to a machine, you'd probably never come back up!
You sure you had enough to eat?
Oh, yes.
- I'm satiated.
- What?
Nothing, I said I'm full, but after we walk all day, you'll probably have to cook up what's left.
She said she loved me.
Oh, hell, it wasn't my fault she picked me to get all wet-brained over.
Well, I'd say she certainly had marvelous judgment, Albert,
If not particularly good taste!
Particularly good!
Here it is.
John Doe.
John Doe is a legitimate name,
Captain Peters.
What do you got?
His wallet was under the bed.
His name was Grubowsky.
Just one more question,
Mrs. Grubowsky.
MRS. - All right.
I know how difficult this must be.
Did your husband have any previous history of heart trouble?
No.
Anything else?
Among other things, coronary thrombosis.
Meaning?
A clot in the right and left ventricle.
Formed by coagulation of the blood.
Due from extreme exhaustion.
Was he fooling around?
Was he ever.
Like I said, I was in the room next door, but I didn't hear anything.
Not a sound.
Are you sure, Mr. Ferris?
Well, think carefully.
Well, except maybe for one thing.
Well, go ahead.
They left the TV set on.
Do you remember what was playing?
No, it was after it went off the air, I mean.
I could hear it humming.
Humming?
You know...
Yeah, yeah.
You remember what time that was?
Oh, about 10:00 p.m.,
I guess.
I don't know.
Anything else?
Sheriff's Department.
No, that's... that's everything.
Well, thank you very much for your cooperation,
Mr. Ferris.
We know how to get in touch with you.
They have all that written down.
Thank you.
We'll be right over.
Bob.
I don't know if it means anything, but
check the local
TV stations.
Right.
What's the matter?
They just found another body.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
Oh, I'm Neil Agar.
State Department of Security.
Oh, yeah.
All right, it's been a madhouse around here.
Somewhere in this mess of bureaucratic garbage is your telegram.
Sorry I couldn't meet you at the airport myself.
Oh, that's okay.
Uh, could I take a look at the Grubowsky file, please?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Um.
When do the stitches come out?
They're out.
I've been briefed.
They asked me to help keep you out of trouble.
What happened?
Uh, nothing much, really.
I guess they sent me down on this one.
It looks like an easy one after that last one.
That's what I figured.
I don't know what the government wants in this one for, it seems innocuous enough.
Well, the Pentagon likes to keep their eye on government-sponsored research facilities, like Brandt.
You know.
Incidentally, we had another one.
Another what?
Another death.
Heart attack, massive coronary.
I've scheduled an autopsy.
This somebody at Brandt,
Captain?
No.
Kid at the factory.
You think the government wants in that one, too?
It was there all the time.
A kid with heart failure?
Thanks.
Just one moment.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Neil Agar.
I'm expected.
Okay-
Great, it's through those double doors.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
I do.
I'm sorry, he's not in his office.
Michael Levy, please call reception.
Hey, I'm really sorry.
Gee, this place is really impressive.
Who's in charge?
I am.
Really?
Yes.
Well, I'm Neil Agar,
State Department Security.
I'm here to investigate
Professor Grubowsky's death.
What can I do for you?
Well, you assisted him, didn't you, on his bacteriological warfare report?
That's right.
Could I see the file, please?
That's, uh, highly confidential information.
Well, you wouldn't want me to pull rank on you, would you?
May I see your clearance?
Now may I see the file, please?
Will Mr. Paul Heller,
please call reception.
How dare you go through my things!
That's just part of the job.
But you were the last person to see him alive,
and you had dinner with him on the night he was murdered.
Why do you say "murdered"?
Sorry.
Well, we had dinner that night.
Uh, whenever we work late, we always have dinner.
Uh, Gretchen knew about it.
- Gretchen?
- His wife.
How convenient.
All right.
You might as well know.
We went to dinner at the Flamingo Bar and Grill.
And by about 10 o'clock, we were playing kneesies under the table, and having dessert.
Like the good old days.
And then we went to the motel.
And then it happened.
What happened?
We balled, and we balled, and we balled.
Till he dropped dead.
Touché.
Let's go to lunch.
It's a small town,
Mr. Agar.
Nothing ever really happens here.
So we have to find ways to amuse ourselves.
We never really get a chance to get down to LA.
There are a lot of sex games that go on here.
Wife swapping, and, uh, a lot of related nonsense.
Scientists really aren't any different from the rest of humanity.
Just a bit more inventive, is all.
Excuse me.
Am I boring you, Mr. Agar?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were saying?
All of Jack's friends are notorious Don Juans.
And do you know that from your own personal experience?
Still doing your job, Mr. Agar?
Do me a favor, will ya?
Just call me Neil?
That's Dr. Murger.
He's head of Reproductive Biology.
His pet project is the study of the two-way transmission
of sensory sexual information.
He's quite a loner, though.
I have yet to see him in the company of a woman.
Kind of ironic for a sex researcher.
Is he straight?
I haven't the vaguest.
Why don't you go get undressed?
Okay.
Oh, Eddie, can't you wait?
Jesus Christ!
I can't believe he's gone.
I didn't know Grubowsky had a bad heart.
No one did.
I'd sure like to meet the girl he was with, hmm?
At least, there couldn't have been too much pain involved.
I mean, how would you classify that?
Accidental manslaughter?
You know what I've always hoped?
What?
That when my time comes...
Yeah?
...there'd be a few seconds of ecstasy...
...and then, oblivion.
No, just think about it, boys.
Coming and going at the same time.
Hello?
Gretchen Grubowsky?
Yes, this is she.
It's very important we have a talk.
Who is this?
I knew your late husband very well.
Who?
I was the last person to see him alive,
if you know what I mean.
I was with him in the motel.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My husband never...
Don't lie to yourself.
It's very important we meet.
It's a matter of his good name.
You understand?
Yes, I understand.
Okay, I'll pick you up at the corner of Pine and Hill
in half an hour.
Well, I for one...
I'm going to miss him.
That dumb, horny bastard.
You gentlemen mind if I join you?
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
I'm Neil Agar,
State Department Security.
Christ, they didn't fly you all the way here for this, did they?
Well, Professor Grubowsky was involved in government research, wasn't he?
I know, but God Almighty, every time somebody gets a nosebleed, you guys run a security check!
Well, doing what you fellows do, we kind of have to keep our eye out for you.
But you didn't watch Grubowsky close enough, did ya?
Uh, you're...
Herb Kline.
Herb Kline.
Yeah, that's, um...
That's Strategic Alternatives.
Right!
And?
Stan Williams. Genetics.
Stan Williams.
This is Aldo Ferrara, head of Department of Diagnostics and Clinical Biometrics.
Glad to meet you.
Thank you.
Uh, listen.
Please forgive us.
You know, naturally, we're quite upset.
- Jack...
- Thanks.
He was a very special man.
I see, uh.
Oh, I take it, then, he was a good friend of all of yours?
Yeah.
Very good friends.
It should happen to me.
Who's the lady?
Ballantine's.
On the rocks.
Dr. Susan Harris.
Uh, she runs the comprehensive entomological lab, along with Dr. Norstad, who heads the department.
Hmm.
It's all right.
That's all right.
Let him get an eyeful of her,
'cause that's all he's going to get.
It's common knowledge.
Iceberg.
Iceberg.
Remember, boys, there's always the six-sevenths below the surface, hmm?
If anyone can help you with
Grubowsky's preliminary state of health bio,
Doctor Lyons can.
Good.
It's strange, he said he'd be here in a few minutes.
Let's wait a few minutes.
I'm sure he'll be right back.
Aloha.
Well, hello!
I didn't see you there.
Thanks.
No, really, it's kind of dark out here.
Hey, you having some trouble?
Nothing you couldn't fix,
Officer.
It may sound ridiculous, but could it be some form of epidemic?
That's a very tough question to answer, Jim.
Now, each death is perfectly normal, in itself.
But what about a 21-year-old boy that dies of thrombosis?
Isn't that just a little unusual?
True.
But there's nothing else we can attribute it to.
At least, that showed up in our autopsy.
You keep talking about sexual exhaustion.
Harv here didn't even have a history of heart trouble.
Neither did Dr. Lyons.
Or Grubowsky.
I don't know what to tell you, Jim.
It's as much a mystery to me as it is to you.
Great.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call in the Public Health Service.
You really think that's necessary?
I don't think we have any choice.
We've got two men dead at Brandt in the last two days.
A little too much of a coincidence.
Keep me posted, will you, Peters?
Keep him posted.
I'd love to.
If I knew what the hell was doing it.
The meeting will come to order, please.
Captain Peters?
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now as you all probably know, we've had eight deaths in the last three days.
I've tried to compile a list here, and fix the actual locations of the bodies where we found them.
Let me see now.
Pardon me.
Yes.
There've been two scientists, a policeman, a cannery worker.
A barber, a gas station attendant, a real-estate broker, and a grade-school teacher.
As you can see, there doesn't seem to be any occupational correlation involved here.
However, there are three points of uniformity
I would like to bring out and underline for you.
One, all the victims have been men.
Two, all the men have been residents of Peckham.
And third, they've all died apparently...
And I'd like to stress the word "apparently"...
By over-exhaustion in the act of sexual intercourse.
I've asked Dr. Murger here to express his opinions to us, because the possibility was thought to exist that some virulent form of venereal disease has been responsible.
Doctor Murger?
Venereal disease, which as many of you are undoubtedly aware...
Louder!
Venereal disease, which as many of you are undoubtedly aware,
has swelled.
Has swelled.
Has swelled to epidemic proportions in the United States and in Western Europe.
Frankly, I have never come in contact with, or heard of,
any form of venereal disease
which could result in the types of deaths we've encountered here
in Peckham.
However, I have a theory so complex, and so puzzling, that even to suggest it before I have the evidence...
Therefore, in the interim, let me suggest a course of action.
That a curfew, possibly sundown, be set up.
Now, let me put it this way to civic, union, and religious leaders in this community.
I must stress the importance of total...
I repeat, total...
Sexual abstinence.
Hold it!
Now, just hold it right there.
This is the stupidest damn thing
I've heard of yet.
Eight guys are dead from ballin',
and you don't even know what's caused it.
Now, I agree with Sam here that you guys over at Brandt's what's done it!
One of your goddamn experiments backfired on you, probably.
Well, let me tell you something.
Me, for one, ain't going to give up what little pleasure
I get from screwing my old lady, or anybody else for that matter!
Now, if we have to listen to some more crazy ideas, I'm leavin'!
All right, all right, just wait a minute!
Now, nobody is trying to legislate or dictate your private morals.
Even if we wanted to,
I don't think we could.
All the man is doing is coming here
and expressing a few opinions on how maybe we could save our lives.
Now, on that basis, that isn't too much to ask, you sit down and listen, is it?
You gotta be kiddin'!
What about that up there?
Huh?
He wants us not to have it.
Oh, you gotta be kidding.
What are you gonna do when you get home tonight, huh?
What are you going to do?
Huh?
Crawl in?
Jeepers.
Excuse me, Stan.
Abstinence isn't going to be anything new around here.
Well, if I were positive it was going to kill you, I'd do it.
You know, those queers over at Brandt, they must think I'm plumb nuts, if they think
I'm going to give an order like that one to our rank and file membership.
You tell 'em, Barney!
You know, being chairman of Local 723 may not mean a hell of a lot to those brains over at Brandt, but, damn it, at least,
I got a little common sense.
- Yeah, that's right, yeah.
- Showed 'em tonight.
Now, me and you boys, we've gone along with a lot of dumb-ass ideas in these last couple years.
But this one takes the cake.
That's for sure.
Now, those guys, they freeze wages, and we gotta lie down and take it.
Well, damn it, they ain't going to freeze anything else!
You guys with me?
- All right.
- We're with you all the way.
- Okay, here. Prost!
- Drink it, drink it harsh!
Drink to it.
Mr. Braddock?
Yeah?
I'm Gretchen Grubowsky.
I believe you knew my late husband.
Mind if I walk with you?
Well, we're a little early,
but this is where Murger said he'd meet us.
You know, Freud said, the idea of dying during or just after the sex act has an ambivalent appeal.
You see, men, for the most part, have a desire for it, but, on the other hand, they fear it.
It's true, like, there is such a thing as psychosomatic death.
Okay, let's say that the first two deaths really were genuine cardiac arrests, okay?
Now, who knows what dormant erotic fantasies that would stir up?
You know what we might have here?
Mass hysteria.
You don't really believe any of that, do you?
No.
You know, I've never kissed a cop before.
What's that?
Let's take a look.
Jesus, It's Dr. Murger.
Oh, my God, they're killing him!
Call Peters.
What do you got there?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks, babe.
Agar!
Yeah?
Any luck?
You'll find a Plymouth, or what's left of the thing, where the bridge is out on the old highway.
- Empty.
- Empty?
That makes nine.
It makes ten.
Ten?
Barney Braddock.
We found him with his pants around his ankles, dead of a massive you-know-what.
All right, all right.
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Natives are getting restless.
Yeah, I don't blame 'em.
Look, take some of your men and find out whose car that was, will ya?
Yeah, I already figured on doing that.
I know you... you government heroes don't expect us local yokels to be able to do anything by ourselves, but we get along all right.
Look, Peters.
I know you've got a job.
I got a job, too.
Right.
There are now three men dead at Brandt.
Hey, Peters.
Peters, I'm trying to say
I'm sorry if I've been stepping on your toes.
All right.
I'm sorry, too.
We're uptight.
You're uptight, I'm uptight, we're all uptight.
Really.
They're dropping like flies, Agar.
They're dropping like flies.
- Great thighs.
- It's got a motor.
It's got a motor in there.
Yeah, hello, operator?
I want area code 202,
State Department 415.
Let's go, Officers.
Everybody! Home!
Come on, now, it's all over.
Yes, call me back here.
Area code 805...
That's right, 9035.
All right, thanks.
Hey, it looks like this is going to take a while.
Why don't you wait in the car?
Okay.
Where is it?
In the lot right behind.
All right.
Be with you in a minute.
Hello.
Uh, yes, Neil Agar here.
Mr. Secretary?
Uh, yes, sir.
I'm sorry to wake you up, sir.
Ah, look at that.
I'll take a baker's dozen, that's what I'll take.
Now.
You gals wanna play rough, huh?
Is that it?
Get... get her, get her, get her.
That's it, she's a cutie pie.
- Don't struggle, baby.
- Don't fight it.
No!
Yeah, come on, come on.
Yes, I know Murger's death wasn't like the others, but that, uh, that doesn't necessarily rule out a pattern.
Yes, I know, sir.
I... I... I don't know why, but I... but I'm sure it's connected with Brandt.
Yeah, all right!
Yeah, get you some.
Get you some of that.
Blow a little smoke at it, warm it up a little bit.
Mmm.
All right, all right!
You get you some of that?
Whoo-hoo!
Yes, I'd recommend that we put up a military quarantine and cordon off this community.
Right, sir.
Well, thank you, sir.
And I'll keep you appraised of any further developments.
Right.
Good night, sir.
If you manage to do me in, there's two more fellas here that'd like to have a crack at you.
Or maybe they just might cut you open and examine you as a medical phenomenon.
Now, what do you think of that, huh?
No!
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!
Neil!
Neil, you can't! Neil!
Neil!
Stop it.
I have a theory, so complex,
and so puzzling...
Hmm.
Joe.
I was in town tonight when they found the body.
But when I got over the shock, all I could think of was all the letters he had from me.
The rest is history.
How'd you meet?
I drive a truck at the cannery.
We met at Harm's bar.
He used to come in there a lot before we, uh, settled down.
Where were you tonight when Murger was killed?
At Harm's, honest.
I've got witnesses.
I was supposed to see Henry tonight, but he telephoned and called it off.
I was angry-
I was hurt.
So you went over to Harm's'?
And you don't have any idea where Murger was tonight?
None at all?
He wasn't with a man.
He was with a girl.
I saw them as they drove through town early this evening.
What she look like?
I don't know.
It was too dark.
She was driving his car, that's all I could make out.
You're sure, Joe?
Well, what the hell do you think made me notice in the first place?
Hey, tell me something, will ya? Um...
Could he make it with a woman?
No way.
Hello.
Mind if I join you?
Hmm?
Please.
How are you, Dr. Harris?
Susan will do.
Where is everybody?
Locked in their rooms,
I shouldn't wonder.
Being thrilled at the latest chapters of the
Phantom of the Rue Morgue.
And you?
Well, I deal in principles of geometry.
Trigonometry, as in the survey.
I'm afraid, uh, abstraction is more Dr. Williams' line, not mine.
I seem to crave nothing but sweets of late.
It's too bad.
Well, what's too bad about it, Herbert?
Well, you know, that's very bad for your appetite.
You see,
I was going to ask you... if you would have dinner with me tonight.
I mean, that is, if you're free.
Oh, I'm quite free, as a matter of fact.
You mean, you will?
Well, I must admit that since the curfew,
Peckham's been more boring than usual.
But I don't see why that should apply to us, do you?
No.
I mean, as long as we're discreet.
Yeah.
Great.
Then, I'll cook you up something extra special.
No scuttlebutt around here?
Well, there was a rumor about Julie and him.
I mean, it was just a rumor, not that anyone took it seriously.
How well did you know Murger?
How well did anyone know Murger?
An introverted recluse.
What can I tell ya?
You, um, you going to
Grubowsky's funeral tomorrow?
Yeah.
Well, he was a fine scientist.
Uh...
That'll be the little woman.
Call it ESP.
Hiya, darling.
See?
Oh, oh, oh... n... now listen,
I, uh...
I've got a summary of recovery operations tacked up on the board, so I'm... I'm afraid I'm going to be nose down and ass up for another couple of hours. So, uh...
Curfew?
For God's sakes, Nora, you're an eternal pessimist.
Relax.
Now, what should happen?
Listen, darling, I've gotta run.
No.
No, don't wait up, okay?
Yeah, tell me later.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I love you, too.
Domestic bliss, Mr. Agar.
They got to know where you are every second.
So, where are you off to?
I'm, uh, meeting Julie Zorn.
Oh, cute girl, if she'd only let her hair down, much too serious.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
We're about to explore the Antarctic and see what's beneath all that ice.
Yeah.
There, seems to be working all right.
Now, tell me again what it is you're looking for.
I don't know, it's just something Peters said.
"They're dropping like flies".
It's just a long shot.
Let's go.
Insects outnumber in species
all the rest of the animal kingdom.
Insects represent the highest grade of evolution
among invertebrate animals,
not only in terms of their complexity of structure,
but also in their psychic development.
You mind if I smoke?
I'm allergic to cigarette smoke.
Oh, well, it's just a bad...
Sure you wouldn't like some dessert?
No, I don't think so.
See, I've got to watch my, uh...
Just a taste?
Well, uh... Hmm, just a...
Mmm.
Mmm.
- It's good.
- Another taste?
Mmm.
The visual organs of insects
consist of compound eyes.
The entire image an insect sees, consequently,
is a mosaic made up of as many units
as there are facets to the cornea.
Multiple vision occurs
throughout the entire insect world.
The complete metamorphosis
of the insect to its adult state occurs within the pupa.
Finally, the worker bees tear open the milky white pupa,
allowing the queen to emerge.
Here, the queen has been marked with a red spot.
The survival of a hive depends upon a fertile queen.
Many queens are developed until one can be made fertile.
During her lifetime, the queen will lay up to 20 million eggs.
Examples of the female
killing the male during mating
are numerous in the insect world.
Here, the black widow awaits the arrival of her mate,
and if the male, upon sexual contact,
is not extremely nimble, his fate is sealed.
The female praying mantis not only
kills the male upon mating, but even proceeds to devour him.
Similarly, the queen bee mates in mid-flight.
Well, that's all the material
I have on hand.
Yes?
Mrs. Kline?
Yes?
Your husband is in grave danger.
He can't come to the phone, but he needs you badly.
Who is this?
Just do exactly as I say,
or you won't ever see him alive again.
Do you understand?
Yes.
There's some sort of social pattern here, but I just can't figure out what it is.
Professor Norstad's the head of the etymological department here, isn't he?
Yeah, but he's away in Europe.
Susan Harris is acting head while he's gone.
I think I should have a talk with her.
Thank you.
I want you to go on home.
But...
No buts.
You've done enough for one day.
This is Neil Agar,
State Department Security.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Harris if she's there, please.
This is Dr. Harris.
I'm sorry, but I'm very busy right now.
Would you please come back during regular office hours?
Uh, no, it's quite important that I see you now.
All right.
I'll be out in a moment.
Hello, Dr. Harris.
Look, I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.
Well, I'm afraid that's impossible.
We're in the middle of a very important experiment.
We, Dr. Harris?
Dr. Norstad and I.
Oh, well, then, he's here?
He's in London.
At an entomological society convention.
I'm working from his notes.
Oh, I see.
Look, Mr. Agar,
I'll answer anything you like, just please be as brief as possible.
I'm in the middle of an experiment.
Dr. Harris, how many times does a queen bee mate?
Only once.
Just once?
And only to reproduce.
Once accomplished, she never mates again.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Calm down, it'll be all right.
Take it easy.
Calm down.
Come on.
You still able to recognize him as Herb Kline?
Positively.
I'd better go tell his wife.
You feel like coming along?
Uh, no, you take care of it.
I'll be at Brandt.
Hey, what's the trouble?
Military quarantine, sir.
You mean, I can't get through?
Orders are to seal off the entire community, sir.
But this is... hey, listen,
I've got to chair a seminar at UCLA this afternoon.
Sorry, sir. Our orders are quite specific.
No one goes out or in.
Well, this is ridiculous.
Who ordered this cordon?
Secretary of State, sir.
- Captain Peters.
- Mrs. Kline?
Why, yes.
Come in, come in.
May I get you something?
- No.
- Coffee or juice?
Oh, no, no, no, thank you.
Actually, I've got some bad news for you, Mrs. Kline.
Ah, at this hour of the morning?
That would be considered shameful.
Yeah, well...
Sit down, at least.
No, I...
Please.
Uh, your husband is dead,
Mrs. Kline.
Herb, dead?
Yes, we found his body at the factory this morning.
The coroner should be calling in about a half an hour to ask you to identify the body.
Oh.
Well, if I don't seem shocked,
Captain Peters, it's only because his passing comes as, uh, no great surprise.
Dear Herb never was what you would call... a cautious man.
Uh... I, um... I'm sorry to be the bearer of such bad news,
Mrs. Kline.
Well...
Well, if there's nothing else for me to do here, I...
I'd better be going.
No! Wait.
Stay, stay awhile.
Keep me company in my time of...
...need.
Uh, no, Mrs. Kline...
Oh... Mrs. Kline...
Are you sure you won't change your mind?
If you give me a couple of hours,
I'll be able to do some research on...
Just the man I want to see.
Hey, Agar, what's with the SS troops?
It's beyond my control.
I've got to be at UCLA before three o'clock.
- You're the only man that can...
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can do about it.
Oh, Christ.
Hey, Aldo, talk some sense into this man, will you?
Herb's dead, Stan.
What?
Like the others.
Oh, my God.
Okay, Agar, give me one good reason why in the hell any one of us should stay in this place.
Calm down, Stan.
Eh, just sit for a minute and listen.
Uh...
You're the geneticist, aren't you?
Can you cross a man and a horse?
You're asking me?
Yes.
I told him you'd get a centaur, mythologically speaking.
Realistically speaking, you'd get a summons for bestiality.
Come on, Agar, what's with the asinine questions?
Look. Look, Williams,
I'm serious.
Now, what about controlled mutations?
We're not ready or able scientifically to have the kind of controls necessary to alter the complex composition of genes and chromosomes...
And... and there are metatheoretical considerations to examine and...
Hey, with what we know now, it would still take centuries of trial and error.
Okay, can you accelerate the process artificially?
Impossible!
No... Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe the androgen and the estrogen hormones were artificially substituted by androgynous hormones, thereby rearranging the cellular structure.
Now that...
Hey, nobody's been able to do that before, except maybe Norstad and his goddamn bees.
Right, right, exactly right,
Norstad and his bees.
Okay, uh..
I have a theory, and it's a wild one, and I'm going to need your help to prove it.
Hey!
Hey!
I need some help!
Can one of you guys help me?
Come on!
What's the matter?
I lost my keys.
I can't find them.
Where at?
Over there between those trees, I think.
You're clutching at straws, Agar.
That's not science, that's fiction.
You can count me out.
Williams, don't be so damn rigid.
- I need...
- Hey, take my advice, Agar.
Go home, lie down.
You're showing the strain.
Bye, Julie. Aldo.
Uh, there is an iota of credibility in your theory, you know.
You mean, you'll help me?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to put all of this in analysis form, so I can send it to the State Department.
All right.
All right, I'll go home and put it on paper.
How soon?
Well, I'll rough out some notes and dictate it,
Elvira will type it up for you before dinner...
Um, it'll be ready.
Great.
Oh, uh, one more...
One other thing...
If this forced mutation, on the energy level that we're talking about, did occur, it should be detectable by a photosensitive gamma-count synthesizer.
What the hell is that?
It works like a camera.
Mutated cells are infiltrated with a measurable degree of gamma radiation, which registers on a special photosensitive plate.
Let's try it.
Whatever you say.
And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write:
Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth."
"Yea," sayeth the Spirit,
"that they may rest from their labors,
for their works follow with them."
"Behold, I tell you a mystery, but we shall all be changed."
"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
"at the last trump:
"for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
"For we must all be made manifest
"before the judgment seat of Christ;
"that each one may receive the things done in the body,
according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad."
"For we know that if the earthly house
"of our tabernacle be dissolved,
"we have a building from God, a house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens."
In as much as it has pleased Almighty God
to take from among us our beloved brother,
we commit his body to the earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
awaiting the final resurrection of our Lord.
Now may the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you and comfort you now and forevermore, amen.
Stan.
Am I still not pretty?
Yes.
I know I've been a sexual bore, but I'd like to make it up to you.
Could I still excite you?
Oh.
Unhook me.
Yes.
Come here.
Oh.
You!
You're part of it!
You and the others!
Stan, what are you talking about?
Stop it!
Stan!
Stan!
Stan!
Stan!
Julie?
Dr. Harris.
I know what you've discovered, and I'd like to explain.
It's really, very simple.
I can only guess at the implications.
I don't think a simple explanation will do.
Well, perhaps not.
But come to my office... and I promise you that what I show you,
you'll be more than satisfied with it.
You'll be safe.
After all, you're a woman.
Crossbreeding with other species
produces a superior being.
It's a well-known fact that thousands of drones
are produced for the express purpose of impregnation.
Uh, they are ultimately slaughtered...
Well, hey, Dr. Harris, what are you doing here?
I've wanted to talk to you alone for some time now.
Julie.
Halt, do you have identification?
I have to get to Brandt.
There's a Jeep down at the end of the line, you can take that.
Right.
Let me out of here!
I've got to get out of here.
Somebody, stop him.
What's going on out here?
Stop!
Don't let him get away!
Stop him!
Get him!
Don't let him get out of here!
Halt! Stop!
Stop where you are.
Hold it. Hold it right there.
Hold it.
Stop him!
Stop him! Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop!
Get out... or I'll pull this lever, and Julie will be dead.
Nobody moves.
But I still don't understand what motivated them.
Well, what Susan Harris didn't realize was that the radiation caused them to be sterile.
So as a consequence, they were endlessly driven to repeat the mating cycle.
Goddamn.
You got that?
Is she finished, Captain?
Oh, yeah, well, why don't you both go get some shut-eye.
I can wrap up things around here.
Come on,
I'll take you home.
Agar, I hope I see you again sometime...
...as a tourist.
Like Susan Harris is a good example.
You know, just stretching beyond all the imagination of vanity... to the point where the mind is even functioning like in some kind of a plastic paradise.
Where nothing can really exist.
It's like... uh... the...
Like to relax, for instance,
I use self-hypnosis.
And, like, I know the mind is like a computer, if I tell myself
I'm gonna fall asleep
at a certain time, I do, no matter what.
And I wake up, and I tell myself positive things.
I mean, it's very...
It's very simple to do... because all you have to do is program yourself.
I mean, it's very easy to relax with self-hypnosis.
I mean, your mind is a computer.
Seriously, how many times have you tried to fall asleep, and just before you're ready to go out, you tell yourself you're going to get up at six.
Just before the alarm clock goes off, you get up automatically.
I've really become a firm believer in self-improvement.
I mean, like, after what happened to me the other night, there's a perfect example,
I'm never going to get caught off-guard again.
I'm going to take this course to improve my body and my mind.
There's either kung fu or karate or tai chi.
And I will be able to...
In any given situation to take someone like you and just flip you right over my shoulder.
Just..
No fair, no fair!
You caught me off-guard!
What were you saying?
Oh, shut up.

I just can't flap my wings fast enough.
Maybe seagulls can't fly faster than 62 miles per hour.
But wouldn't it be great if we could?
I wonder how high I could really fly, what the world would look like from way up there.
My wings are heavy.
I don't feel steady.
[WIND WAILING]
I didn't fall all the way.
I can do it.
I've got to make it higher than anyone's ever flown before.
I can.
I can see everywhere.
How am I gonna tell them?
How am I gonna say it?
Mother, Father...
...I hope you'll understand.
This time you have to.
I've found things that will change our lives.
There's such a world out there.
None of us have ever seen it or felt it.
I've just flown up today higher than we ever fly, far above the highest clouds.
But you can see.
I mean, you can see everywhere.
For the first time in my life
I see where we live.
MOTHER: Son, we looked everywhere for you the last few days.
FATHER: The elders in the flock are talking about you.
MOTHER: They know you fly off on your own, where we never fly.
They don't understand it.
They will not allow it.
MALE SEAGULL:
Not allow me to learn? Why?
MOTHER: Oh, I can understand your dreams, Jonathan.
We all dream of better things when we're young.
I'm afraid...
...for you.
I'm afraid of what you're doing.
FATHER: Maybe this isn't the best life, but it's all we know.
Winter's coming.
The flock must stay together to survive.
We were meant to live the way we live, accept it.
Take your place.
Will you try, Son?
MOTHER: If you don't, we will have all lived for nothing.
JONATHAN: We weren't meant to live this way.
I know you're wrong.
But... I'll try.
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
[SCREECHING]
[♪ Neil Diamond: Flightof the Gull]
JONATHAN: Maybe the secret is fixed wings.
Flap up to 50 and hold the wings still.
I'll bet that's it.
Fifty and still.
It won't hurt anybody if I try that. Will it?
It won't hurt anybody, take away anybody's freedom if I just slip out and give it a try.
Nothing to worry about.
Just a very simple thing here.
I'm going to make a simple dive, to 50 miles per hour and hold the wings steady and go straight on down.
Here we go.
This is it.
Thirty, 40, 50...
No. No! Pull out!
I... I can't do it.
I'll be killed.
[WIND WAILING]
What is this? I'm afraid.
I'm on the right way of doing this, and I'm afraid.
So, what are you going to do?
You going to glide around here for the rest of your life without trying?
If you're scared, go back to the flock where everyone else is scared too.
Sixty... 70.
Faster than any seagull has ever...
Pull!
There's got to be more to life than fighting for some fish head somewhere.
There's no way around it.
If I was meant to learn so much about flying,
I'd have charts for brains.
If I were meant to fly fast,
I'd have a falcon's short wings, live on mice instead of fish.
I've got to live with what I am.
I promise this day that I will be a seagull...
...like every other seagull.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Dear Father]
Does my life end here?
I can't believe that.
I wasn't born to drown in this ocean.
I can die here, or I can force myself to fly.
[STRUGGLING] It's in me.
It's in me!
I've got to try.
I've got to get back home.
At last I can stop thinking, for once in my life.
Just stop thinking and fly towards the lights in the dark.
Dark?
Seagulls never fly in the dark.
Get down.
If you were meant to fly in the dark, you'd have the eyes of an owl.
You'd have charts for brains.
You'd have a falcon's short wings.
A falcon's short wings.
I dive on the wingtips only.
[WIND WAILING]
Why didn't I think?
Short wings. Short wings.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Dear Father]
Faster than any seagull anywhere. Ever!
I'll teach the others.
I'll show the flock how!
[WIND WAILING]
I did it!
It works.
Short wings all controlled. It works!
I must have hit 170 in the dive, and that was just a short dive.
What will I hit if I dive from 10,000 feet?
[♪ Neil Diamond: Skybird]
JONATHAN: A quick roll in, fold the wings, just the tips out in the air, take her straight down just like last night, and we'll see just how fast a seagull can fly.

JONATHAN: One-eighty! One-ninety!
Oh, God! The flock!
Look out!
[ALL SCREECH]
The elders. The whole flock.
They believe me now.
They finally understand.
ELDER: Jonathan Livingston Seagull...
...you have been called here to be judged in the sight of your flock.
Jonathan Gull, for your reckless flying, for refusing to join the flock to which you were born, for turning your back upon the traditions of your flock, assembled here.
JONATHAN: I haven't turned my back.
I want to share what I've found with all of you.
ELDER: Jonathan Livingston Seagull, you do not live as we live.
You do not fly as we fly.
You do not believe as we believe.
You will learn that life is the unknown and the unknowable.
We are put into this world to survive any way we can, as long as we can.
JONATHAN: I don't believe that.
ELDER: Jonathan Seagull, the brotherhood is broken.
Never again will you see any of your flock.
Never again will you have the protection of your flock.
You are henceforth and forever outcast!
JONATHAN: Outcast.
- MOTHER: Jonathan.

JONATHAN: Who are you?
1ST MALE GULL: Hello, Jonathan.
We're from your new flock.
We're your brothers.
We've come to show you a higher place.
JONATHAN: I don't have any flock.
I'm old, I'm tired.
I can't fly any higher.
2ND MALE GULL: But you can, Jonathan.
For you have learned.
One school is finished, and it is time for another to begin.
JONATHAN: Oh...
...I see.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Anthem]
JONATHAN: Am I an outcast here too?
FEMALE GULL: Jonathan, we've come to take you home.
It's time to begin.
JONATHAN: I don't know quite where I am.
Have I slept a long time?
FEMALE GULL: Only for a short while.
I'm Maureen, your instructor here.
We're going to learn together.
JONATHAN: Maureen.
Your name came into my mind even before you said it.
MAUREEN: Welcome home.
JONATHAN: Home?
I've never been here before.
MAUREEN: Maybe not.
Feels like home though, doesn't it?
JONATHAN: Everything feels different.
Where is everybody?
Why aren't there more of us here?
MAUREEN: The only answer I can see,
Jonathan, is that you were pretty well a one-in-a-million bird.
Most of us came along ever so slowly.
We went from one world into another that was almost exactly like it, forgetting right away where we'd come from, not caring where we were headed, living for the moment.
Do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating or fighting or power in the flock?
Many lives, Jon.
And then other lives to learn that there is such a thing as perfection.
And others again, to finally get the idea that our purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth.
But you, Jonathan, learned so much at one time that you didn't have to go through 100 lives to reach this one.
JONATHAN: My life back there,
I don't remember very well.
Everything's blurred, I...
All those years.
MAUREEN: Cast out? Alone?
JONATHAN: Yes. But it was a fine life.
MAUREEN: Didn't you say you know me from somewhere?
I believe there were many somewheres.
I know what it is to speak, to feel and never to be heard.
JONATHAN: Can I really learn to fly without limits?
MAUREEN: Maybe you'll find something that will mean even more to you than flying without limits.
To learn what perfection really is.
Let's try some real flying now.
You're adjusting very well to your new body, and to the air here.
It's almost time for you to meet the elders here.
JONATHAN: I don't want to see an elder as long as I...
Well...
MAUREEN: Are you afraid to say "live"?
Have you ever felt more alive? Happier?
JONATHAN: No, that's... that's just the point. I...
I don't want any elder telling me what I can't do.
MAUREEN: This is your new flock,
Jonathan.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Be]
JONATHAN: What was that?
Maureen?
Look up there.
MAUREEN: Oh, I was afraid he'd gone away.
Jonathan, that's Chiang.
Not bad, for a feeble old elder.
JONATHAN: Maureen, I never saw anyone fly like that.
CHIANG: Good evening, Maureen.
Jonathan.
MAUREEN: Good evening, Chiang.
JONATHAN: Hello, sir.
It's an honour to meet you.
CHIANG: The honour is mine,
Jonathan Seagull.
Maureen.
He learns well?
MAUREEN: A little impatient is all.
He knows everything I know.
And more now.
JONATHAN: Maureen, how can you say that? I have so much to learn.
You know so much more than I.
MAUREEN: Jonathan, you know it now.
You still need to practise smoothness and patience, but you know the flying very well.
JONATHAN: I still have questions.
CHIANG: Ask whatever you want.
JONATHAN: I... Well...
Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?
Where we are now.
It isn't heaven at all.
CHIANG: Who said it was?
Heaven isn't a place.
Heaven's perfection.
Wouldn't you think?
And we don't go there, as much as we express it.
Does that sound true to you?
JONATHAN: Yes.
I suppose.
CHIANG: You're a very fast flyer.
JONATHAN: Well, I...
I enjoy travelling quickly, but I don't like limits.
I want to fly faster than I can now and higher and learn more.
I can fly 276 miles per hour now.
Level. That's pretty fast, but it's not fast enough.
Don't ask me why, but it just isn't fast enough.
CHIANG: What is fast enough, Jonathan?
You who are impatient to be perfect.
What is perfect speed?
JONATHAN: Well...
...perfect speed.
CHIANG: A thousand miles per hour?
That's a limit.
A million miles an hour?
That's a limit.
Speed of light?
That's a limit too.
JONATHAN: They're all limits.
CHIANG: Perfect speed, my son, isn't moving fast at all.
Perfect speed is being there.
So...
JONATHAN: Maureen, did you see that?
MAUREEN: He says we can all learn that, whenever we want to learn it.
The next life maybe.
CHIANG: It is not so difficult,
Jonathan, once we understand.
JONATHAN: I want to understand, now.
What does it feel like?
How far can you go?
CHIANG: To any place, to any time that you wish to go.
I've gone everywhere and every-when I can think of.
After a while, one begins to think that space and time are not quite real.
JONATHAN: Can you teach me to fly like that?
CHIANG: Of course. If you want to learn.
JONATHAN: Yes, I want.
When can we start? I'll do anything.
Maureen, did you see...?
I've got to learn.
How do you do it?
I mean, how...?
CHIANG: First, you let your teacher get a word in edgewise.
JONATHAN: I'm sorry, Chiang.
It's just that all my life...
I can't explain it.
...I've had this...
This need to know.
CHIANG: To fly as fast as thought, to anywhere that is now, or ever has been or ever will be, you begin by knowing that you've already arrived.
JONATHAN: I beg your pardon?
I am already there, on that highest peak.
I am not limited by any body.
I am not limited by space.
I am not limited by time.
I am a perfect expression of freedom, here and now.
All right, here I go.
I am going right... now!
Now!
Now?
MAUREEN: Jonathan?
Can I bring you anything?
JONATHAN: No.
Nothing.
I have to do this.
I don't care how long
I have to stand here, I will do it.
CHIANG: Would you like to take a break?
JONATHAN: Good evening, sir, I...
I'm concentrating as hard as I can.
I just can't get it.
CHIANG: Jon, you don't need faith.
You don't need faith to fly.
You need to understand flying, don't you?
To learn certain facts about things you cannot see.
This is just the same.
JONATHAN: I am a perfect expression of freedom and flight.
Why am I thinking that way?
This isn't some ritual.
Real is real.
I really am a perfect idea.
It works. It really works.
CHIANG: Well, of course it works,
Jonathan.
It always works when you know what you're doing.
Now, about your control...
Well, it's different anyway.
JONATHAN: We're trapped in here.
There's no way out of here.
CHIANG: Jonathan, there's a way out.
JONATHAN: Oh... yes.
But why did I come here at all?
CHIANG: Like attracts like.
Wherever your thought is, that is where your body is going to be, sooner or later.
You're just learning to do it sooner.
Did you want to be walled away, to think this over?
Here you are.
Try it again.
And hold your thought on something you've always loved.
JONATHAN: I know things I love, but I'm not sure.
CHIANG: Do it. I'm with you.
JONATHAN: I have always liked stars.
CHIANG: It is a fine view.
And a good place to be alone.
But so much of love is giving, don't you think?
Sharing the very best you know with someone who's trying to learn.
Try it again, and this time, think giving.
No special names or place.
Just think love and see where you turn up.
JONATHAN: Oh... Ready?
CHIANG: Any time.
JONATHAN: What's this?
What's happening?
My old flock. I don't love them.
CHIANG: Don't you, Jonathan?
JONATHAN: Well, I always did want to give them what I'd learned about flying, if that's what you mean by love, but I never found the way.
CHIANG: When the time is right for you to give to them, nothing can keep it from happening.
When it's wrong, nothing can make it be.
JONATHAN: I can't see how that can ever happen.
CHIANG: Don't worry about it.
Try it, once more now.
Think love and being in the place that's right for you to be now.
JONATHAN: Oh... Hello, Maureen.
MAUREEN: Hello, Jonathan.
CHIANG: The time's come for me to leave you.
There are others I must help.
And there is more for me to learn.
JONATHAN: You can't leave now.
I've only begun.
CHIANG: Jonathan Seagull, someday you will know how long ago your flight began and how great a journey you have travelled.
Now you are ready to begin the most difficult and the most powerful journey of all.
You are ready to fly up and know the meaning of kindness and love.
Jonathan, you were born to be a teacher, to give the truth to anyone struggling to break out of his limits.
It is important to give what you have found, as a gift, to whomever will accept it.
JONATHAN: Chiang, I know
I'll see you again.
CHIANG: Of course you will, and, Jonathan, keep working on love.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Be]
MAUREEN: What's the matter?
JONATHAN: How much more I would've known, if someone like Chiang had come along the day
I was an outcast.
What a different life I would have had.
What a different life the flock back there would've had.
Maureen, I have to go back.
MAUREEN: We're always parting.
We're always saying goodbye.
JONATHAN: I know you don't want me to go.
I know my old flock doesn't care what flying is.
They don't care about learning.
They don't care about looking beyond what they see with their eyes, but, Maureen, there's got to be somebody in that time who cares.
MAUREEN: Jonathan, go with my love.
JONATHAN: Maureen, goodbye for now.
MAUREEN: I love who you are, Jonathan.
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
ELDER: Fletcher Lynd Seagull, you were born to us, but you are not part of us.
You cry against the flock and against the law.
You ask questions, answered 1,000 years ago.
You do not wish the protection of the flock.
And you shall not have it.
You are henceforth and forever...
...outcast!
FLETCHER: I don't want your protection.
You're gonna wish you never...
All your "henceforth and forever."
It's not gonna be me who needs protection.
It's not gonna be me!
I don't care what they say.
There's one hell of a lot more to flying than just flapping around from A to B.
A mosquito can do that.
One little barrel roll around the elder to show him what's possible, and I'm outcast.
Can't they see?
Can't they... they think of the glory it'll be when we really find out how to fly?
Damn the flock.
I'll be outlaw all right.
Outlaw like they never saw before.
I'll make them so sorry.
JONATHAN: Don't hurt them,
Fletcher Seagull.
FLETCHER: Who are you?
JONATHAN: In casting you out, the other gulls have only hurt themselves, and one day they will know this, and one day they will see what you see.
Forgive them and help them understand.
FLETCHER: I don't understand.
JONATHAN: Fletcher Lynd Seagull, do you want to learn to fly?
Do you want to fly so much that you will forgive the flock? And learn?
And go back to them one day and help them know?
FLETCHER: I do!
JONATHAN: Then, Fletcher, let's begin with level flight.
We're all outcasts.
We're all friends.
We're learning to fly just for the fun of it.
Take your time.
Your whole body from wingtip to wingtip is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see.
Break the chains of your thought, and you break the chains of your body too.
[♪ Neil Diamond: Skybird]
JONATHAN: That's fine, Fletcher.
Judy Lee.
Fly it nice and loose until you get used to formation flying.
We'll just go on practicing, and you can slide in closer whenever you feel like it.
Fletcher, it's time to go.
FLETCHER: Time to go where, Jonathan?
JONATHAN: Back to the flock.
We have a gift to give.
FLETCHER: But we're not ready.
We're not welcome.
Jonathan, we're outcast.
We can't force ourselves where we're not welcome, can we?
And it's the law of the flock!
JONATHAN: We're free to go where we wish and to be what we are.
FLETCHER: Why bother with the flock?
Seagulls are the laziest, dirtiest, most vicious...
JONATHAN: Suspicious, clumsiest.
A seagull hardly knows how to walk.
But don't you see, Fletcher?
A seagull wasn't made to walk.
He was made to fly, and when he learns to fly, he's the purest, loveliest, most graceful creature alive.
True for you, true for me, true for all the flock.
We can soar free across the sky, but how often we don't want to.
That's the gift we can give, to help those who want to learn find what they love to do.
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
ELDER: It is the law of the flock that an outcast never returns.
Anyone who follows them, anyone who listens to them, anyone who turns his back on the flock will be outcast too!
JONATHAN: I only wish to share what I've learned.
The very simple fact that it is right for a gull to fly because freedom is the very nature of his being.
Whatever stands against that freedom must be set aside.
We don't need ritual and superstitions to live.
ELDER: The law of the flock decides!
JONATHAN: Do you speak of law?
Is it the law which decrees we must fight among ourselves just to feed on garbage?
It can't be!
The only true law is that which sets us free.
There can be no other.
MALE GULL: How can you expect us to fly as you fly?
You are special and gifted and divine, above other birds.
JONATHAN: Look at Fletcher,
Charles-Roland, Judy Lee.
Are they also special and gifted and divine?
No more than you are.
No more than I am.
The only difference, the very only one, is that they have begun to understand what they really are and have begun to practise it.
MALE GULL: What if we could fly like that?
ELDER: They're outcasts. Ignore them.
- Don't listen to him. Ignore him!
- [ALL SQUAWK]
Ignore them.
Ignore them all. They're outcasts.
Anyone who looks upon an outcast breaks the law of the flock!
Ignore them.
Ignore him!
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
[♪ Neil Diamond: Dear Father]
JONATHAN: Each of us finds and follows what we most love to do, no matter what others think.
And this brings us automatically to discover more of who we really are.
There's a law there, a principle like aerodynamics, that simply does not fail.
You can count on it.
- YOUNG GULL: Help me.
- JONATHAN: Hello, Kirk Maynard.
KIRK: I want to fly more than anything in the world. Please.
JONATHAN: We can start learning right now.
KIRK: You don't understand. My wing.
I can't move my wing.
JONATHAN: You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.
KIRK: Are you saying I can fly?
MALE GULL: Kirk Maynard can't fly.
He was born crippled.
- He's never been off the ground.
- JONATHAN: You're free, Kirk Maynard.
Fly.
Fly!
[♪ Neil Diamond: Flightof the Gull]
[SEAGULLS CALLING]
KIRK: I can fly.
I can fly!
Listen, I can fly.
I can fly!
MALE GULL: Fletcher says he'll come right down here in front of us at 200 miles an hour.
Just to prove it.
If he can learn it, I can learn it.
FEMALE GULL: I'll believe it when he shows us how.
2ND MALE GULL: Sorry,
I just don't believe it.
A normal seagull like you and me is not meant to fly at 200 miles an hour.
2ND FEMALE GULL:
Somewhere up there Fletcher's flying.
I've known him since he was your age.
BABY GULL: I'm afraid, Mother.
I want to go with you.
MOTHER GULL: Stay here.
I want you safe.
FLETCHER: Here we go.
They won't believe it till they see it with their eyes, till we prove it especially for them.
MALE GULL: Listen, we should be able to hear him.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- Quiet, I think I hear him.
FLETCHER: I'm ready.
[WIND HOWLING]
- MALE GULL: Here he comes!
- FEMALE GULL: Do you believe now?
- MALE GULL: I can't.
- BABY GULL: Mother! Where are you?
MALE GULL: Look at that baby bird! He's in Fletcher's way! He'll get killed!
[SCREECHING]
[WIND HOWLING]
[FLETCHER GROANING] Oh.
I had to.
I would have hit him.
- But why?
- JONATHAN: The trick, Fletcher, is that we're trying to overcome our limitations in order, patiently.
We don't go flying through rock until a little later in the programme.
FLETCHER: Jonathan!
JONATHAN: Also known as the Son of the Great Gull?
FLETCHER: What are you doing here?
The... The cliff.
There was a... a baby gull gliding down.
Haven't I...?
Didn't I... die?
JONATHAN: Oh, Fletcher, come on, think.
If you're talking to me now, then obviously you didn't die, did you?
You merely changed your level of thinking... rather abruptly.
It's your choice now. You can stay here and learn on this level, which is quite a bit higher than the one you left, by the way, or you can go back and keep working in the flock.
The elders were hoping for some kind of disaster, but they're startled that you would oblige them so well.
FLETCHER: I want to go back to the flock.
Of course! There's a new group...
I haven't even begun.
JONATHAN: You're sure you wouldn't rather stay?
FLETCHER: Let's get going.
JONATHAN: All right, Fletcher.
Remember what we were saying about our body being nothing more than thought itself?
Fletcher.
Fletcher?
FLETCHER: It's true.
Jon, I'm beginning to see.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- FEMALE GULL: He's alive!
2ND FEMALE GULL: He touched him with a feather. Brought him to life!
MALE GULL: He is the Son of the Great Gull.
ELDER: It's a trick!
Don't listen to him!
- [EXCITED CHATTER]
- ELDER: He's a devil!
He's the devil!
MALE GULL: He is the devil.
He is the devil!
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
ELDER: I tell you he is the devil!
He can destroy us all!
He can destroy the flock!
Kill him!
Kill him!
[ALL SHOUTING]
ELDER: Kill him!
[ALL SCREECHING]
ELDER: Kill him!!
Kill him!!
JONATHAN: Would you feel better if we left?
FLETCHER: They wanted to kill us!
How did we get away?
JONATHAN: Like everything else,
Fletcher, practice.
FLETCHER: I don't understand. The flock was gonna kill us. Our own flock!
Why? Remember what you said about loving the flock enough to return to them and help them live?
They wanted us dead.
They're a mob. They're killers.
How can you love them?
JONATHAN: You don't love hatred and evil, of course.
You have to practise and see the good in every one of them and help them see it in themselves.
That's what we mean by love.
It's fun... when you get the idea of it.
I remember a fierce young bird, for instance.
Fletcher Lynd Seagull, his name.
Just been made outcast, ready to fight the flock to the death, getting a start on building his own bitter hell out on the far cliffs.
And here he is today, building his own heaven instead and leading the whole flock in that direction.
FLETCHER: Me? Leading?
You're the instructor here.
You can't leave us.
JONATHAN: Don't you think there might be other flocks, other Fletchers that need an instructor now more than this one?
FLETCHER: But me, Jon?
I'm just a plain seagull, and you're...
JONATHAN: Oh, yes, yes, I know. The only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose.
Fletcher, you don't need me anymore.
All the younger ones in the flock and some of the others too are ready to follow you now.
All you need is to keep finding the real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull.
He's your instructor.
And don't let them spread silly rumours about me or try to make me some sort of a god, will you, Fletcher?
I'm a seagull. I like to fly, maybe.
FLETCHER: Jonathan.
JONATHAN: We both have learned what we were meant to learn in our time together, Fletcher.
That the way to find perfection and love is within us.
Look with your understanding.
Find out what you already know.
Use it, Fletcher.
Teach it, show it forth.
And you'll know the way to fly.

- I tried to, sir. Not a crackle.
Skipper, I took an Earth time reading just before reentry.
What'd you get?
Three thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five.
- AD.
- Almighty God.
Well, we were following
Taylor's trajectory.
Whatever happened to us must have happened to him.
What about us? Where are we?
Well, in my opinion, skipper, we've passed through a Hasslein Curve, a bend in time.
I don't know what planet we're on, but the fact is, we're both of us here, we're breathing, we're conscious, we got plenty of oxygen, water...
Here.
No, we're gonna be all right, skipper.
We're gonna be all right.
As soon as you feel better, we'll run a navigational estimate.
God, if I could only see the sun.
It's up there all right.
You can feel it.
Yes. But which sun?
I don't know. I don't know.
Our computer's shot.
We're lucky to be alive.
Lucky? No.
If it's 3955 AD, I...
Oh, my God. My wife.
My two daughters.
Dead.
Everyone I ever knew.
Everyone.
Who are you? I... Don't be afraid. I just...
Just tell me where I am.
Can you understand me?
My name's Brent.
Brent.
No. No, no, I don't wanna hurt you. I...
I just wanna know where I am.
Where are you from? I mean, your people.
Where are they?
How do I... How do I get to them?
Which way?
Can you... Can you talk?
Right, right. So you can't talk.
What's that?
Taylor!
Where is he?
Taylor. Taylor.
Nova.
Nova. Nova. Come on.
That's the idea. Taylor. Nova. Here.
Taylor. Taylor.
Here. There's a prize.
You go to the head of the class.
Why don't we just settle down and found a colony?
All the kids'll learn to talk.
Sure they will.
Now, where in hell do we go from here?
We might make it yet.
Taylor. Taylor.
Just tell me what happened to him.
Is he hurt? Is he alive? Where is he?
That wasn't here.
A minute ago, that wasn't here.
I'm not the only one. She sees it too.
Listen. Listen, now. If you lose me...
If you lose me, try to find Zira. Remember?
Zira. Go find Zira.
Zira.
This tag. Did he give it to you?
Where did you get this?
Look, is there... is there someone... some other... someone who can talk?
Look, you take me to Taylor.
Taylor.
Taylor. Now. Which way?
My God! It's...
It's a city of apes!
I'll tell you one thing that every good soldier knows.
The only thing that counts in the end is power!
Naked, merciless force!
Members of the Citizens' Council,
I am a simple soldier.
And as a soldier, I see things simply.
I don't say all humans are evil, simply because their skin is white.
No! But our great Lawgiver tells us that never, never will the human have the ape's divine faculty for being able to distinguish between evil and good.
Because the only good human is a dead human!
It's a bloody nightmare.
But those fortunate enough to remain alive will have the privilege of being used by our revered minister of science, the good Dr Zaius.
- Zira, stop. You're in danger.
- So is the future of science, with that rabble-rouser fomenting a senseless military adventure.
The forbidden zone has been closed for centuries, and rightly so.
However, we now have evidence that that vast barren area is inhabited.
By what or by whom, we don't know.
But if they live, and live they do, then they must eat.
Now we must replenish the lands that were ravaged by the humans with new, improved feeding grounds.
And these grounds we can obtain in the once forbidden zone.
It is therefore our holy duty to put our feet upon it, to enter it, to put the marks of our guns and our wheels and our flags upon it!
To expand the boundaries of our ineluctable power!
And to invade! Invade!
Invade! Invade!
- Zira, as your husband, I beg you to stand.
- Only for my principles.
All right. For your principles and mine.
Only please stand.
I gotta get out.
Yeah, I gotta get back up there.
I don't know how, or what with, but I'm not staying here.
Well, General,
I only pray you know what you're doing.
How can you have any doubt, Dr Zaius?
You're aware of the reports we've received of strange manifestations in the forbidden zone.
Manifestations which you, if I might add, as minister of science have been unable to fathom.
Twelve.
Twelve of my finest scouts just disappeared. Vanished into thin air.
Eleven.
Very well, eleven. Eleven.
And the twelfth returned with incredible stories of huge walls of fire, strange, violent earthquakes, his mind gone, shattered no doubt by some un-simian torture.
Well, General,
I still think you're being hasty.
No, Doctor. Decisive.
So we invade, or we stop.
- It's as simple as that.
- And as dangerous.
What is more dangerous than famine, Doctor?
The unknown.
If I had any proper sense of scientific purpose, Cornelius,
I shouldn't cut up the healthy heads of humans.
I should dissect the diseased brains of gorillas to find out what went wrong.
And how would you put it right?
I'd wet-nurse their babies on the milk of chimpanzees.
The milk of kindness.
At least our child when it's born won't be breast-fed on bile.
You know, my dear, the trouble with us intellectuals is that we have responsibilities and no power.
I think I'll make a chocolate icing.
Do you like chocolate?
- What, dear?
- No, no, no. Of course you don't.
- But I do.
- lf we had that power here in our hands, we'd be worse than them.
I don't agree.
Gorillas are cruel because they're stupid.
- All bone and no brain.
- Zira, my dear,
I wish you would not talk like that.
Somebody is liable to hear you.
- Nova!
- What are you doing here?
Taylor?
No, not Taylor. My name's Brent.
- You talked.
- That's impossible.
In a whole lifetime devoted to the scientific study of humans,
I've only found one other who could talk.
- Yes. Taylor.
- Taylor. Is he alive? Have you seen him?
- Where? Where? Tell us.
- Where? Where? I don't know where.
I'm trying to find him.
The longer I stay around here, the less I'm beginning to care.
We loved Taylor.
He was a fine, a unique, specimen.
Why, if it had not been for Zira here, he would still be here, a stuffed specimen in the great hall of the Zaius Museum with his two friends.
With his two friends?
I don't plan to stay here quite that long.
Can you get me some food, some water?
A map, so at least
I'll have some idea where I'm heading?
- You want that taken care of, too.
- I'll get the map.
Now, if you will look up here...
Yes, towards the north.
This was the last place that we saw Taylor and Nova.
- What is that damn stuff?
- You wouldn't know if I told you.
Just relax.
Among other things, I'm a trained vet.
- Great. Go on.
- Taylor was riding with Nova here, between the lake and the sea.
They were heading into the territory we call...
Yes, I know, the forbidden zone.
- Who told you that?
- Your glorious leader back there.
- Zira!
- Quick. Quick.
- Cornelius, open the door.
- Put the things away.
Open it!
Dr Zaius. How nice.
We were just about to have something to eat.
Not until I've talked some sense to that headstrong wife of yours.
- Where is she?
- Good day, Dr Zaius.
Good heavens.
Has there been an accident?
Cornelius hit me.
For my bad behavior at the meeting.
- I don't blame him.
- I don't resent it.
But his nails need clipping.
Enough of this nonsense.
Are you so blind, you two psychologists, that you're unaware that we're on the verge of a grave crisis?
- You heard the Ursus' speech.
- Militaristic tripe!
- Zira!
- Perhaps.
But now he has the incident he requires to go on a rampage of conquest.
- But that is appalling!
- To remain silent while this bully Ursus is permitted to destroy everything in his path is no longer possible.
As minister of science, it is my duty to find out whether some other form of life exists.
- Where are you going?
- Into the forbidden zone, with Ursus.
Another manhunt, Doctor?
Someone, or something, has outwitted the intelligence of the gorillas.
- That shouldn't be difficult.
- Zira.
We apes have learned to live in innocence.
Let no one, be it man or some other creature, dare to contaminate that innocence.
Why, is innocence so evil?
- Ignorance is.
- There is a time for truth.
And the time is always now.
Are you asking me to surrender my principles?
I am asking you to be the guardians of the principles of science during my absence.
I am asking for a truce with your personal convictions in an hour of public danger.
And you shall have it, Dr Zaius, or I shall hit her again.
Let us have no violence, Cornelius.
- Now, I'm relying on you both.
- And we are counting on you too, Doctor.
If I should fail to return from the unknown, the whole future of our civilization may be yours to preserve or destroy.
So think well before you act.
Well, goodbye, Dr Zaius, and good luck.
Now we can finish this up and get you out of here!
Yeah, get me outta here, please!
I've seen the humane way they treat humans here. I don't much care for it.
- Have you a horse?
- Yeah, out in the scrub.
I'd better get you another set of clothes.
The kind fit for humans like yourself.
You'll pass. Get rid of this.
And this too.
If you are caught by the gorillas, you must remember one thing.
- What's that?
- Never to speak.
What the hell would
I have to say to a gorilla?
But you don't understand.
Only apes can speak. Not her, and not you.
If they catch you speaking, they will dissect you, and they will kill you, in that order.
Cornelius is right. Be very careful.
And get out of those things that you're wearing as soon as you can.
Thanks.
- Thank us by finding Taylor.
- Yeah, if he's still alive.
Four.
Seven inches.
Sergeant, wait!
This is a type E cranium. Very unusual.
Weak occipital development, and substandard lobe...
Female. It's been a long time since we've been able to study specimens of such extraordinary clinical interest.
- Bring them inside.
- No!
No, you can't have them.
They are marked for target practice.
Take them away.
- I'll take the key.
- To the target range!
Wait! Wait!
I'd better double-lock the door.
Good luck. All right!
God Almighty!
This used to be my home.
I lived here, worked here.
What happened?
What could have happened?
My God, did we finally do it?
Did we finally really do it?
O God, bless, we pray You, our great army and its supreme commander on the eve of a holy war, undertaken for Your sake.
And grant, in the name of Your prophet, our great Lawgiver, that we, Your chosen servants, created and born in Your divine image, may aspire the more perfectly to that spiritual godliness and bodily beauty which You in Your infinite mercy have thought fit to deny to our brutish enemies!
So be it.
There they go,
Dr Zaius trotting along beside them.
Don't be too hard on the old boy, Zira.
His motives are honest.
He has only one motive, to keep things exactly as they have always been.
I say that it's time for a change.
But Zira, we chimpanzees are too few.
How can we take initiative when they are in control?
Love yes, war no!
- No more lies, no more crud!
- No more guns, no more blood!
Stop! Stop! Stop the war!
- Freedom! Freedom!
- Whoa!
- Freedom!
- Peace!
Peace and freedom!
- Get off the road, young people.
- Freedom!
- We want freedom!
- Get 'em out of the way.
- Wait.
- We want freedom! We want peace!
We don't want martyrs, do we?
We want peace! We want freedom!
- Sergeant? Do it quietly.
- No clubs, no clubs.
We want peace! We want freedom!
Gorilla brutality!
Sergeant!
Are you what we were, before we learned to talk and made a mess of everything?
Did any good ever come from all that talk around all those tables?
- I don't know where they are.
- I wonder where the hell we are.
- We're near the forbidden zone.
- Hell, that's where the army is headed.
- They'll roll over us, blow us to bits.
- Why can't we go back to our outfits?
Because the sarge says to keep lookin' until we find them.
Nova! Nova, Nova, wake up.
We gotta get goin'. Come on.
That hum.
You hear it too?
All right, come on. We're gonna follow it.
Well, whoever, or whatever, something's guiding us.
Whatever they are, they breathe air.
There's an intelligence working here.
That sound is either a warning or a directional device, I don't know which.
It doesn't much matter.
They know we're here.
Put my hands round her throat!
Off!
Hold her throat down until she dies!
No!
Get out!
Get out of my head!
I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
What did you say?
What do you mean, "there's no point"?
Will they hurt her?
No, maybe not physically, but here.
Here. You can hurt here, I know.
Your lips don't move.
But I can hear.
I know. I mean...
I know what you're thinking.
Nothing. I saw nothing.
Who are you?
Brent. Who are you?
I see. "The only reality in the universe."
Well, that's nice to know.
I got here by accident.
How did you get here?
You're wrong.
Why would I want to spy on you?
I'm not even sure you exist.
Of course I know who I am.
I'm an astronaut.
I was sent here on a rescue mission.
To find a fellow astronaut. Taylor.
Well, from this planet, but from another time, 2,000 years ago.
I know. I know it sounds insane.
And it's my insanity.
No. No, I don't know how to get back.
We came through a defect.
A slippage in time.
That's what must have happened to Taylor.
I'm sure he tried to get back.
Yes, my skipper's dead. I'm alone.
Who?
"Nova"? What's that?
Some star or galaxy? What's "Nova"?
All right, all right! Yes, I know her.
I know her!
No, no. She's harmless. Let her alone.
All right.
Just tell me what you want to know.
She helped me. To break out ofApe City.
No, wait. Wait a minute!
Stop it!
I can't understand you if you're all screaming at me at the same time.
I can't separate it!
He's right. He has only limited intelligence.
We should speak aloud, and one at a time.
Are we to understand that you were in the city of the apes?
- Yes. Yes, two days ago.
- What sights did you see?
- You're talking.
- Certainly we can talk.
It's a primitive accomplishment.
We use it when we must.
- When we pray.
- When we sing to our God.
You mean that thing out there?
An atomic bomb?
- Your God?
- You don't understand, Mr Brent.
The Bomb is a holy weapon of peace.
Holy weapon of peace!
Mr Brent, we are a patient people.
But we are determined to know what the apes want. War or peace?
Try to understand.
The only weapons we have are purely illusion.
You just imagine that he hurt you.
Traumatic hypnosis is a weapon of peace.
Like the visual deterrent.
Or the sonic deterrent.
Let me make a last appeal to your reason, before we inflict more of this on you.
These are weapons of peace, Mr Brent.
- Like all our weapons.
- Mere illusions.
Illusions. Damn your hypocrisy!
Is that bomb out there... is that an illusion?
It's operational, isn't it?
The firing mechanism. It's intact, isn't it?
We very much need your help, Mr Brent.
- Why?
- We are the Keepers of the Divine Bomb.
- It is our only reason for survival.
- And yet as you see we are defenseless.
Defenseless against the slobbering, monstrous, materialistic apes.
I'll help nobody.
- Go ahead, annihilate each other.
- I forgive you your language.
There are times, I know, when your sanity is about to give way.
I hope that does not happen.
- I hope you can tell us...
- Exactly what the apes are planning.
We've caught some of their scouts.
They're hideous creatures.
And we've had them here, standing precisely where you are now.
Either their skulls were too thick, or they really knew nothing at all.
Neither do I. Can't you understand that?
I don't know anything.
You make us very sad, Mr Brent.
She can't help you. She can't even talk.
- Don't harm her.
- We never harm anyone, Mr Brent.
You're going to harm her.
- The apes are semiarticulate...
- You're lying.
How do you know?
How do you always know?
Nova.
- Now...
- Tell us of the apes.
The apes are marching on your city.
Bugler, sound the advance.
Ursus!
Ursus, I warned you.
Look what we are faced with!
- I told you you should wait.
- Brutal butchery!
I swear those responsible shall pay with torture and with death!
If you have any pity, get your soldiers to shoot our poor people.
I can't order them to do what the Lawgiver has forbidden.
"Ape shall not kill ape."
Hold your positions!
He bleeds!
The Lawgiver bleeds!
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives.
We are still God's chosen ones.
This is a vision, and it is a lie!
The vision was false!
Bugler, sound the advance.
Advance!
Stupid animals! They don't have the brain to hold our illusions.
- We have no defense.
- Except our Bomb.
- Call our people to High Sanctuary.
- Do you know the range of their city?
- Yes.
- Set in the mechanism and wait for me.
I want a public thought projection, at adult and infant level.
Adults to the cathedral, infants indoors.
Is now and ever shall be
World without end, Amen
The heavens declare the glory of the Bomb and the firmament showeth His handiwork.
His sound has gone out unto all the lands and His light unto the end of the world.
He descendeth from the outermost part of heaven.
Nothing is hid from the heat thereof.
There is neither speech nor language, yet His voice is heard among them.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
My strength, and my redeemer.
Glory be to the Bomb and to the Holy Fallout, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
O mighty and everlasting Bomb, who came down among us to make heaven under earth, lighten our darkness.
O instrument of God, grant us thy peace.
Almighty Bomb
Who destroyed all devils
And created angels
Behold this moment
Behold the truth that abides in us.
Reveal that truth unto that Maker.
- I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
- Unto my God.
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The good Bomb made us all
He gave us eyes to see with
And lips that we might tell
How great the Bomb Almighty
Who made all things well
Let everyone go to his private shelter.
Empty the streets.
They are to find the City of the Dead.
May the blessing of the Bomb Almighty and the fellowship of the Holy Fallout descend on us all this day, and forevermore.
I trust this simple ceremony convinced you of our peaceable intentions.
- I'd like to thank you for your cooperation.
- When may we hope to be set free?
You may hope whenever you please, Mr Brent.
How could we hope to let you go on the eve of war, Mr Brent?
You know too many of our secrets.
Like your friend.
- Taylor!
- You're... Brent!
- My God! Taylor!
- Brent, how in the hell did you get here?
The same way you did.
Spaceship, Ape City, subway...
- By yourself?
- No. No, Nova found me.
- Is she with you? Where?
- I don't know.
They separated us.
They were trying to make me kill her.
Mr Taylor, Mr Brent.
We are a peaceful people.
We don't kill our enemies, we get our enemies to kill each other.
I'm fighting.
I'm fighting. I don't wanna...
Taylor. Taylor!
Taylor!
Unto God
I reveal my inmost self.
He's hurt bad.
This isn't exactly sterile.
We'll do the best we can.
Taylor. Taylor, they got a bomb.
Atomic bomb.
It's operational. They intend to use it.
- What type is it?
- I don't know.
I don't know what type.
I've never seen it before.
- Well, didn't you see a series number?
- No numbers.
Just some letters on one of the fins.
Greek letters.
Alpha and...
- And omega.
- What?
The Doomsday Bomb.
My God!
What a lovely souvenir from the 20th century.
They weren't satisfied with a bomb that could knock out a city.
They finally built one with a cobalt casing.
All in the sweet name of peace.
Those bloody fools.
They don't know what they've got.
I mean, they pray to the damn thing.
If they shoot it off at some of those apes, it could set off a chain reaction in the whole atmosphere.
Burn the planet to a cinder.
How's that for your ultimate weapon?
This must be what your scout reported.
A subterranean passage.
I think it's worth exploring.
What will you do, Holiness?
Everything necessary.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm thinking just that.
Nova? Nova, you...
Oh God!
We should let 'em all die.
The gorillas, every damned...
Look what it comes to.
It's time it was finished. Finished.
Taylor.
Come on, come on. The bomb.
Yeah.
Why not?
They're obscene!
Follow me!
Sergeant!
Arrest that creature!
- This is the instrument of my God.
- He can speak!
Your God, eh?
Sergeant.
Your God didn't save you, did he?
Ursus! Ursus, are you mad?
That weapon is built by man.
You can't shoot it down with only a clip of bullets.
If we can't shoot it down, we'll pull it down. Rope!
Block and tackle! Get on it!
But you don't know what you're doing!
It'll kill us all!
I'll find a way to stop it.
Get him! Over there!
Ursus! Someone at the pillar.
Zaius...
- Taylor!
- It's Doomsday.
The end of the world.
- Help me.
- You ask me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction!
You bloody bastard!
In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-size star.
- Red Baron Control. Red Baron Five.
- Go ahead, Red Baron Five.
Roger. Orbiting southeast corner of sector Alpha Charlie.
We've spotted what appears to be a spacecraft just outside the surf line.
Alert rescue. Advise we can remain on station for 45 minutes.
- Will squawk 7700 for a radar fix.
- Roger.
Rescue, I have Red Baron Five report of possible spacecraft offshore, southeast sector Alpha Charlie.
Launch chopper. Effect pickup and recovery. Base radar will vector.
Everybody out! Let's move.
Come on, let's go.
Sergeant, get that half-track here and get a cable to those frogmen.
Yes, sir!
The general, sir.
- Anybody in that thing?
- I don't know, sir. We just beached it.
- All right, open her up.
- Open it up!
Welcome, gentlemen, to the United St...
- Did you call the zoo?
- Yes, sir. We're in luck.
The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub and a depressed gorilla.
The apes'll be hidden from the public and quarantined.
If they need medical attention, it's available.
The experts can give them the once-over tomorrow.
- General Brody's very pleased.
- Oh, me too.
We can't let a lot of monkeys leave their messes on the floor.
Have they been fed? Raw steak?
The zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
- They suggested oranges.
- Good God!
What's the matter, Corporal?
Oh, excuse me. I didn't mean to disturb you while you're dressing.
- What the hell am I saying?
- They're pretending to dress, sir.
What do you mean? They are dressing!
- Where are the clothes from?
- They brought them.
- What?
- In that suitcase.
Greg, maybe you should give "em their oranges.
Well, they're...
They're going to the zoo infirmary.
Arrange for a police escort at 1630 hours.
They'll have company there.
There's a gorilla in the next cage.
Why did it do that?
Here you are, little fella.
Boy, you really are sick.
Hello, missy. Have a banana.
Have it your own way, mate.
- Zira!
- I'm not his mate, I'm yours.
Control yourself.
I think they're trying to be kind.
This cage stinks of gorilla.
Cornelius, where are we?
What's happened?
I know where we are.
I know what has happened.
In some fashion, and I lack the intellect to know precisely how, we have traveled from
Earth's future to Earth's past.
But we saw the Earth destroyed.
And Earth will be destroyed, just as we saw it.
Only, since seeing it, we have passed through a backward disturbance in time.
Did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship?
Yes.
We returned to Earth nearly
2,000 years before its destruction.
That is another reason for us to keep silent.
Our human captors will not be edified to learn that their world will crack like an egg and burn to a cinder because of an ape war of aggression.
Apes, at this instant in time, cannot yet talk.
For the moment, we should follow their example.
The driver gave me this report from the air base.
Better read it before we start the test.
Yeah, it's the usual imitated behavior.
Mimicking salutes, handshaking, eating off plates with knives.
What is it?
- There was a carpetbag in the ship.
- Full of food?
No, clothes. And it seems they changed into them.
I don't believe it!
Hi, Dr Dixon. Dr Branton.
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning.
- The female's a bit uppity, sir.
- OK, I'll be careful.
I see you've prepared the Wisconsin
Multiphasic. We'll begin with that.
Go easy now, Stevie.
Oh, they look pretty docile to me.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
Unless the craft was remotely controlled, they must have been conditioned to push the right buttons. They can't be morons.
All right, we'll take the female first.
Arthur, would you set up a...
Well, she seems to be pretty smart.
All right, let's make it more difficult.
- They... haven't had their breakfast yet?
- Not a bite, just as you ordered.
Good. We'll go for the banana.
Well, why doesn't she take it?
Because I loathe bananas!
Zira!
- I don't believe it.
- Yes.
Arthur, I think Dr Branton needs some air.
- Zira, are you mad?
- Dr Milo, please do not call my wife mad!
I did not call her mad, I merely asked her if she was. And I repeat: are you mad?
I hate deceit!
Well, there is a time for truth and a time, not for lies, but for silence.
Until we know who our friends are...
How in the name of God are we to know that unless we communicate?
- We can speak, so I spoke.
- And we can listen.
- To a lot of psychiatric small talk.
- And we can watch!
- A display of primitive apparatus.
- It couldn't test the intelligence of a newt!
- Calm yourself.
- I am calm!
- Zira!
- Stop arguing!
It's too late for that.
Use your heads and start thinking.
Now that they know we can speak, how much will we tell them?
Milo!
We'll need a full autopsy.
With emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Let us know when the report comes in, will you, please?
I'd better do this alone.
We mean you no harm.
Do you understand? We will not hurt you.
Poor Doctor Milo.
- Doctor?
- Yes, "Doctor." And you killed him.
No, I didn't. He did.
- One of your own kind.
- He's a gorilla.
Well, look, there's nothing to be afraid of.
He's in chains. He's under sedation.
Do you understand that?
I should. I've been doing it half my life to humans.
- Humans?
- I'm a psychiatrist.
Oh, I'm a psychiatrist, too.
Do you... have a name?
My name is Cornelius.
This is my wife, Zira.
And I'm Lewis. Lewis Dixon.
Nobody's gonna believe this.
- Believe what?
- That primitive apes can talk.
- Primitive?
- Well, I mean that in our... primitive civilization, apes just don't talk.
I mean, I think it's important that when our primitive security precautions are lifted, that the first time you say anything in public, you should talk to what we primitively call the right people.
May I say something... personal?
Please.
I like you.
I have from the beginning.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Mr President.
I'm aware that what I have to say may create a credibility gap wider than the Grand Canyon.
Nonetheless, it is true.
Yesterday, a US spacecraft splashed down off the southern California coast.
It was one of two that have been missing in space for over two years.
To be exact, the one commanded by Colonel Taylor.
- Have they identified the bodies?
- They have identified three bodies, yes.
All living...
- Taylor's alive?
...at the time of their rescue.
Through an unfortunate accident, one was killed this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.
Zoo?
What would astronauts be doing in a zoo, Mr President?
They are not astronauts, General Faulkner.
They are apes.
Chimpanzees, to be more precise.
They're harmless, friendly, and, by all reports, extremely intelligent and sophisticated.
But, naturally, being animals, they cannot tell us where the ship came from or how they came to be in it.
I have therefore decided to convene a Presidential Commission of Inquiry in Los Angeles tomorrow.
The two surviving apes will be presented to the commission for their inspection.
The press will be invited to attend, not to participate.
I don't believe that we can withhold this extraordinary discovery from the world any longer.
One of the two American spaceships believed to have disintegrated in orbit splashed down yesterday in the Pacific
Ocean, off the coast of southern California, and is stated to have been manned, if you can call it "manned," by monkeys.
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.
I haven't got time now. A little later.
Here comes the chairman.
As the president's science advisor, what do you expect to experience from this historic meeting?
Fear.
All right now. After I break the news,
I want you to start slowly with simple answers to what will be simple questions.
And if the questions become less simple?
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira. Please?
- They're ready, sir.
- All right, it's time.
What do they think we are? Gorillas?
I'm sorry.
That's it. Just be seated.
Mr Chairman, members of the commission, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Lewis Dixon.
I am the animal psychiatrist who has been in charge of these two apes since they came to the Los Angeles Zoo.
My associate, Dr Stephanie Branton, and I are ready to answer your questions.
What may astonish you is that our chimpanzee friends are ready to answer your questions, too.
Not by signs, not by looks or movements, but by words.
Dr Dixon. As a zoologist,
I know and respect your work, but if you want to turn a Presidential Inquiry into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you...
And I have to inform you that these apes have the power of speech.
Come, now. You know as well as I do their brain system is not developed in either the vocal or abstract-thinking area.
Yes, sir, but they do have the power of speech, and it is for you gentlemen to assess how far that power can be exercised intelligently.
May we be told which is the female of the species?
Did she rise as a reflex to you having indicated her, or in answer to my question?
That's for you to decide.
- Have you a name?
- Zira.
Certainly she can articulate, which in itself is extraordinary.
But, Dr Dixon, are we to infer that Zira is her name, or some phrase in her own language?
Infer what you will, Mr Chairman.
I suggest you rephrase the question.
What is your name?
- One might as well be talking to a parrot.
- A parrot?
Mechanical mimicry.
Unique in an ape vocally, without a doubt.
But... does the other one talk?
Only when she lets me.
- Dr Hasslein.
- No. Nothing.
- Mr Chairman.
- Yes.
What is the male's name, please?
- Cornelius.
- My lawfully wedded spouse.
- Wedded?
- We'll take that up later, Your Eminence.
Cornelius, do you and your lawfully wedded spouse speak any language other than English?
What is English?
I speak the language taught to me by my parents, who were taught by their parents.
It has been the language of our ancestors for nearly 2,000 years.
As to its origins, who can be sure?
The gorillas and orangutans of our community believe that God created the ape in His own image, and that our language...
Nonsense!
Cornelius, as an intellectual, you know the gorillas are militaristic nincompoops and the orangutans, a bunch of blinkered, pseudoscientific geese!
As to humans, I've dissect...
I've examined thousands of them, and, until now, I've only discovered two who could talk in my life.
God knows who taught them.
Where we come from, apes talk.
Humans are dumb.
- Where do you come from, Cornelius?
- I'm not sure.
Dr Milo was sure.
Dr Milo was a genius well in advance of his time.
When the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard, it was Dr Milo who salvaged it.
He studied it and half understood it.
Half? Was half enough?
It was enough for us to escape when war became inevitable.
Enough for Dr Milo to be murdered in your zoo.
Enough for my wife and I to be here now.
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you. I'm not sure.
Maybe the female knows.
Of course "the female" knows.
We came from your future.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's the only thing that does.
- Mr Chairman.
- Yes.
Cornelius. You spoke of war.
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives...
Lived. Will live.
- Who won the war?
- I don't know.
The chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.
- Which Dr Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.
Cornelius, did you know a Colonel Taylor?
No. Is he a soldier?
We are peaceful creatures.
We are happy to be here.
May we be unchained?
- Gentlemen, do you have anything to say?
- No comment.
No comment.
- Mr Chairman, a word.
- Here's one: preposterous.
- Can you define that?
- No, just let me say this as head of this commission. We will examine the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions on to the president for implementation.
What a load of huggermugger.
No comment.
- How will you advise the president?
- No comment.
Could you tell us how you personally would handle it?
No, gentlemen. No comment.
Yet.
- You were fabulous!
- Marvelous. All that applause, but...
But... there was a moment...
- There was. When he started to ask...
- Zira.
- Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
- No.
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.
I have to be honest with someone.
Cornelius, please.
You tell them.
Well, you see...
We did know Colonel Taylor.
We came to love him.
What harm could there be in telling that to the commission?
Where we come from, apes did not love humans.
They... hunted them for sport, much as you would animals.
Yes, we used their bodies, alive and dead, experimentally.
For anatomical dissection and scientific research.
Well...
We do the same thing to animals.
I mean, as a scientist I sympathize, but
I agree that's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to.
I think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of Colonel Taylor.
There was another reason.
What?
They would have asked if he was still alive.
- And is he?
- Oh, no. He can't be.
- How do you know?
- Cos...
From the windows of the spaceship...
We saw the Earth... destroyed.
Stand by.
Good evening.
This is Bill Bonds in Los Angeles.
The biggest story since the moon landing broke when two apes talked,
I repeat, talked to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry.
With me this evening is Dr Otto Hasslein.
He is a senior scientific advisor at the White House.
He'll give his views on the crucial statement made at today's session.
Dr Hasslein, as I recall, when you asked the male ape where he was from,
- the female replied "From your future."
- Yes.
Do you believe that?
Absolutely.
I think it is the only explanation.
Maybe the explanation needs some explaining.
You've written several learned dissertations on the nature of time.
Could you explain, in terms we can understand, how, for instance, a person, or persons, could travel from time past to time future, or, indeed, vice versa?
Mr Bonds, I think time can only be fully understood by an observer with a godlike gift of infinite regression.
Could you explain
"infinite regression" for us?
- Roll the film.
- I came prepared to do just that.
Now, here's a painting of a landscape.
Now, the artist who painted that picture says "Something is missing. What is it?"
"It is I myself who was part of the landscape I painted."
So he mentally takes a step backward, or regresses, and paints a picture of the artist painting a picture of the landscape.
But still something is missing.
That is still his real self painting the second picture.
So he regresses further, and paints a third.
A picture of the artist painting a picture of the artist painting a picture of the landscape.
And because something is still missing, he paints a fourth and a fifth until he paints a picture of the artist painting a picture of the artist painting a picture of the artist painting a picture of the artist painting a landscape.
So infinite regression, then, is...
The moment when our artist has regressed to the point of infinity and is part of the landscape he painted, and is both the observer and the observed.
In that peculiar condition, what would he be observing if he were observing, let's say, time?
He would perceive that time is like a freeway with an infinite number of lanes, all leading from the past into the future, however, not into the same future.
A driver in lane A may crash, while a driver in lane B survives.
It follows that a driver, by changing lanes, can change his future.
It is not difficult to believe that in the dark and turbulent corridors of outer space, the impact of some distant planetary, even galactic, disaster jumped the apes from their present into ours.
Indeed, the proof lies in their arrival among us and in their spoken testimony.
Thank you very much, Dr Hasslein.
It's the most incredible story this reporter has ever covered.
By their intelligence and good humor, the so-called "ape-onauts" have already captured the hearts of the American nation.
They will not be required to appear before the commission tomorrow.
That hearing is going to be held in private.
They will, however, be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel and given an extended tour of the city.
This is Bill Bonds, reporting for Eyewitness News. Good night.
Good night.
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course it's mine!
Address, please?
The zoo.
May I measure your inside leg, sir?
- No!
- Oh.
Dr Cornelius.
Tell me, how do you find our women?
Very human.
Very good!
Excuse me.
Madam Zira, I represent
Fur and Feather, a pet magazine...
Do you think I'm a pet?
Well, yes, I do rather.
Say, why don't you try some?
- What is it?
- It's sort of like grape juice plus.
Wait, just a sip.
Madam Zira, what is your favorite fruit?
Grape.
And that's the way it was tonight at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
Tomorrow, Zira is to speak at the Bay Area Women's Club.
She'll then accompany Dr Hasslein to the Museum of Natural History.
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend a prizefight - that's his first one.
Later, he'll visit Disneyland to dedicate a new boat for the Jungle Cruise.
Now for a look at the weather. Sunny
California will not be that tomorrow.
Clouds will cover the coastal area with light showers predicted.
- Tired?
- A little.
How is that?
Soothing.
But very wet.
A marriage bed is made for two, but every damn morning, it's the woman who has to make it.
We have heads as well as hands.
I call upon men to let us use them.
How do you like it, Cornelius?
Beastly.
We are now approaching Antrodemus valens Leidy, a giant flesh-eating dinosaur.
Its scientific name is a compound of the Greek antron, which means hollow, and demus, which means body frame, referring to the backbone or vertebra.
Now, this little fellow is Camptosaurus Marsh, a primitive duck-billed dinosaur.
Its scientific name is a compound of the
Greek campto, which means flexible or bent, and saurus, which means lizard.
Its generic name therefore is "flexible lizard."
In 1879, OC Marsh of Yale University described the first known species from the Jurassic beds of Wyoming.
Other specimens have been found throughout...
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!
I'm pregnant.
I shan't leave you until Cornelius is back.
- No, no.
- No, I insist. Please sit down.
Now, is there anything I can get you, Zira?
Well... I have a strange craving...
That is only natural.
...for Grape Juice Plus.
- Grape Juice Plus.
- It's in the refrigerator.
All right.
Is this it?
Here we are.
Lewis said only a sip.
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you, especially in cases of pregnancy, you know?
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Oh, no. I shouldn't.
Not in view of your condition.
Who won your war?
It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas" war.
Chimpanzees are pashi...
Pacifists.
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.
- But which side won?
- Neither.
But how do you know that if you weren't there?
When we were in space, we saw a bright, white, blinding light.
And then we saw the rim of the Earth melt.
And then there was a tornado in the sky.
I feel magnificently sleepy.
The date meter on the spaceship.
What did it read after Earth's destruction?
Nineteen... seventy... three.
And before?
Before the white light and the tornado?
Thirty-nine... fifty... something.
- Before the white light and the tornado?
- Thirty-nine... fifty... something.
- So?
- You have evidence, Mr President, that one day talking apes will dominate this Earth and destroy it by 3950-something.
I doubt that we shall still be in office by then.
And according to the NASA experts, who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny, the precise year of what you merely infer to be Earth's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955.
AD, presumably.
Now, what do you expect me and the United Nations, though not necessarily in that order, to do about it?
Alter what you believe to be the future by slaughtering two innocents, or rather three, now that one of them is pregnant?
Herod tried that and Christ survived.
- Herod lacked our facilities.
- He also became very unpopular.
Historically unpopular.
And we don't want that to happen, do we?
- Are you saying...
- I am saying that our two visitors seem to be very charming, peaceful people, or rather, creatures, and the voters love them.
Do you want their progeny to dominate the world?
Well, not at the next election, no.
But, one day, if the progeny turn out as well as the parents, who knows?
They may do a better job of it than we have.
- By destroying the world?
Are you quite sure that what they saw destroyed was the world?
Well, aren't you?
I consider it dispassionately as a possibility.
Not hysterically as a fact.
We have their own testimony that they provoked the war.
And they seem to have provoked you into the bargain.
I'm not saying that you're wrong, Hasslein, but before I have them shot against a wall
I want convincing that the handwriting on the wall is calculably true.
Now... convince me.
By their own testimony, we know that apes will acquire the power of intelligent speech.
By Zira's testimony, we know that she's pregnant with child.
By my testimony, we know it is genetically possible for this child, provided that we permit its birth, to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a present-day jungle or a present-day zoo.
But do you truly believe that by deliberate present-day action we can neutralize that possibility and alter the future?
- Yes, Mr President, I do.
- Do you also believe that we should?
Given the power to alter the future, have we the right to use it?
I don't know.
I've wrestled with this,
Mr President, and I don't know.
How many futures are there?
Which future has God, if there is a God, chosen for man's destiny?
If I urge the destruction of these two apes, am I defying God's will or obeying it?
- Am I His enemy or His instrument?
- An assassin would say the latter.
Do you approve of assassination?
We condoned the attempted assassination of Hitler because he was evil.
Would we have approved killing him in babyhood when he was innocent, or killing his mother, or slaughtering his remote ancestors?
We have no proof that these apes are evil.
- There are very strong indications.
- Such as?
The discrepancies in their answers to the commission
- suggest that, if properly interrogated...
- Are you suggesting that they weren't?
- Unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?
- The full works.
- Tell that to the commission.
I'll abide by their findings.
Having convened in secret session at the request of the president, the commission makes these interim recommendations.
One: the public should be informed that the apes, after their arduous space voyage and the fatigue arising from its publicity, are to be afforded rest in a location whose identity will not be divulged to the public.
Two: since, however, there is justifiable cause for suspecting that they have withheld vital information from us, the ape-onauts will in fact be escorted by Dr Lewis Dixon to the installation known as Camp 11, held there in his care for interrogation by the CIA under the guidance and supervision of Dr Otto Hasslein.
When we were in space, we saw a bright, white, blinding light...
Brighter than this?
Then we saw the rim of the Earth melt.
Then there was a tornado in the sky.
That's your voice, isn't it?
How can I tell? I don't even remember.
- Why don't you remember?
- Because Dr Hasslein made me drunk.
Why tell him something when drunk that you never told the commission when sober?
Because you were frightened for the safety of yourselves and your unborn child?
- I withheld nothing. Nobody asked me.
- But if somebody had asked?
I should have said that chimpanzees had no part in the destruction of Earth.
Only the gorillas and the orangutans.
What's the difference? You're all monkeys.
Please! Do not say "monkey."
It is offensive.
As an archaeologist, I saw history scrolls which were kept secret from the masses, and I suspect that the weapon which destroyed Earth was man's own invention.
I do know this. One of the reasons for man's original downfall was your peculiar habit of murdering one another.
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.
Cornelius.
This is not an interracial hassle, but a search for facts.
We do not deny the possibility of man's decline and fall.
All we want to find out is how apes rose.
Well...
It began in our prehistory
- with the plague that fell upon dogs.
- And cats.
Hundreds and thousands of them died.
Hundreds and thousands of them had to be destroyed in order to prevent the spread of infection.
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes.
And by the time the plague was contained, man was without pets.
Of course, for man this was intolerable.
I mean, he might kill his brother, but he could not kill his dog.
So humans took primitive apes as pets.
Primitive and dumb, but still 20 times more intelligent than dogs or cats.
Correct.
They were quartered in cages, but they lived and moved freely in human homes.
They became responsive to human speech, and, in the course of less than two centuries, they progressed from performing mere tricks to performing services.
Nothing more or less than a well-trained sheepdog could do.
Could a sheepdog cook?
Or clean the house?
Or do the marketing for the groceries with a list from its mistress? Or wait on tables?
Or, after three more centuries, turn the tables on their owners?
How?
They became alert to the concept of slavery.
And, as their numbers grew, to slavery's antidote which, of course, is unity.
At first, they began assembling in small groups.
They learned the art of corporate and militant action.
They learned to refuse.
At first, they just grunted their refusal.
But then, on an historic day, which is commemorated by my species and fully documented in the sacred scrolls, there came Aldo.
He did not grunt. He articulated.
He spoke a word which had been spoken to him time without number by humans.
He said...
"No."
So that's how it all started.
Clip one, please.
Where we come from, apes talk.
Humans are dumb.
You recognize your husband's words to the commission?
Yes.
So humans were dumb. Were they happy?
Clip two.
As to humans, I've dissec...
I've examined thousands of them, and, until now, I've only discovered two who could talk in my life.
Why did you change words in the middle of the sentence?
Repeat first three seconds of clip two.
As to humans, I've dissec...
I've examined...
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.
Play the loop.
- Complete the word, monkey!
- I told you...
Complete the word!
It sounds as if I had hiccups.
Call for Dr Dixon, please.
Dr Dixon! Dr Hasslein calling Dr Dixon.
Calling Dr Dixon!
Ah, Dr Dixon. Come in.
Be good enough to administer this to the female.
- Why? What is it?
- Sodium Pentothal. One half gram I.V.
- Dr Hasslein, I'm an animal psychiatrist...
- And a qualified vet.
We have the commission's authority.
And that of the president. Please.
Zira, I've been asked to give you an injection...
No, you can't use that!
We only use those things for killing.
- Killing?
- No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.
This is for relaxing. It won't harm her.
- Will it harm my baby?
- No. No, it won't.
So, Zira, if you would just come with me, please.
- Lewis, you can't use that on Zira!
- I promise...
- Please take him to his quarters.
- Lewis, you...
No, you mustn't!
Please.
Just lie down on the couch.
And bare your arm, please.
You don't have to tell me.
This has the same effect as Grape Juice Plus.
Now count backward from ten.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... five... four...
What comes after four?
Two.
- Thank you, Dr Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.
You worked in a room like this?
Bigger. Not so pretty.
And there you practiced...
Comparative.
Comparative what?
Anatomy?
Whose anatomies did you compare?
Apes and humans?
Zira, say "yes" if you mean yes.
Yes.
So you dissected other apes?
Yes. When they died a natural death.
- And humans too, of course.
- Yes.
As they were made available.
Available?
The gorillas hunted them for sport, with nets and with guns.
The survivors were put in cages.
The army used some of them for target practice.
We could take our scientific pick of the rest.
And, in the interest of science, you dissected, removed and statistically compared...
Bones, muscles, tendons, veins, arteries, kidneys, livers, hearts, stomachs, reproductive organs, nails, tongues, eyes, noses, nervous systems, the various reflexes...
Reflexes? Of the dead?
No, no. Of the living!
You can't make a dead man's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse's reaction to a prefrontal lobotomy!
You mean you were advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on living humans?
Oh, yes!
We even tried to stimulate their atrophied speech centers.
Did you try to stimulate
Colonel Taylor's speech center?
Of course not! He could talk already.
When you left, was Colonel Taylor still alive?
We loved Taylor.
We did all we could to help him,
Cornelius and I.
- Cornelius!
- She should have a nap now.
She'll get it.
- Orderly.
- Sir?
Please take the female ape to its quarters.
Yes, sir.
We have to get this to the commission immediately.
Gentlemen.
I've received an official notification from the president, ratifying the recommendations made by this commission in light of the tape recordings delivered to us by Dr Hasslein.
Now, if you'll just be seated, we'll get right down to business.
Now, let me review our conclusions.
One: by a majority vote, the commission finds no solid evidence for hostility by either ape towards humans as at present constituted in this year of our Lord 1973.
Let me remind you that this was by a majority vote.
The male's attitude is that of a well-disposed academician who studied the alleged downfall of the human race with the true objectivity of a good historian.
The female's case is different in that she committed actions against the human race of a sort which, if committed today, would be called atrocities.
But would they be so called in 2,000 years" time when it is alleged that humans will have become dumb brutes with the restricted intelligence of animals?
It has been pointed out that what apes will do to humans is no more than what humans are now doing to beasts.
Nonetheless, the commission is sympathetic to Dr Hasslein's conviction that the progeny of these apes could in centuries to come prove an increasing threat to the human race and conceivably end by dominating it.
This is a risk we dare not ignore.
Therefore, the commission unanimously recommends that the birth of the female ape's unborn child should be prevented and, after its prenatal removal, both the male and female should humanely be rendered incapable of bearing another.
I now declare this commission dissolved.
Savages! They are savages!
Jabbing needles into my pregnant wife!
I've done that too, dear. And worse.
Taylor thought we were savages at first.
Did they make you tell them about Taylor, too?
They made me tell them everything, Cornelius.
Brutes!
Shall I tell you something?
I'm glad I did. We can't live with lies.
After this, I doubt we shall be allowed to live at all.
Do you mean that?
How long?
A week. Maybe sooner.
They treated you like dirt.
Ma'am. Sir. Chow time.
I'm not hungry.
Well, maybe somebody else is who can't talk yet.
Come on, ma'am. It's pure vitamin C.
You better have your soup and oranges for the sake of that little monkey.
- No, Cornelius!
- Nobody makes a fool out of my wife.
- But ought we to call for...
- We just ought to leave.
I'll be going back with Dr Hasslein soon.
I'm the one who has to tell them.
- Stevie, you gotta come help me.
- Of course. I'll come right away.
It just seems so cruel and horrible and...
I don't know. I'll see you.
- Cruel, Dr Dixon?
- Unbelievably. Zira wants her baby.
- So do I.
- But dead.
Yes.
You'd prefer the parents dead, too.
Shall we go?
Gate four.
Just a minute, sir. I'll take a look.
No, sir. The lieutenant hasn't checked in.
- Night, Charlie.
- Night, Ed.
Yes, sir, I'll tell him. "Contact the motor pool." Yes, sir. Just as soon as I see him.
Gate four.
Oh, yes, Captain.
No, sir. The supply truck isn't due until 0600 hours.
- Well, I'm sorry, sir.
- Good night, Charlie.
I said good night.
We haven't any way to contact him until then.
The depot's closed, sir.
OK, sir. I'll be off duty, but the relief comes on at 0430 hours and I'll get him to pass the message.
Yes, sir.
Zira, what's the matter?
I think my pains have begun.
Oh, my dear.
Administration, Doctor. It's urgent.
- What happened?
- The apes killed their orderly.
- Where are they?
- On the run.
Now they've killed, and for that they must be killed.
It has to be done before we start a stone rolling that'll gather enough poison moss to kill us all!
Look. I'm going back to the camp.
I'm going to find Lewis and get help.
- No!
- Zira!
I just lost my temper with the boy.
Now, they may...
- It's better now. I can walk.
- Listen to me!
They may punish us for what we did, but at least the baby will be born.
- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.
Then there will be no need for a shooting match.
- Not strictly speaking, no.
- I am speaking strictly, Hasslein.
Science regards these apes as unique.
The people regard them as practically human.
Then they must be told that today's killers could be tomorrow's mass murderers.
Of course they must. I can think of no one better equipped emotionally than yourself to persuade them of that possibility.
But, in a democracy, we do not shoot unarmed suspects on sight for a murder in which their participation is still unproven.
I want them taken, yes. But taken alive!
- Is that clear?
- Quite clear, Mr President.
You lost, miss?
Oh, it's you, Dr Branton.
You better be careful.
There's been a murder.
- Murder?
- Yes, ma'am.
The monkeys have killed their orderly and escaped.
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?
I don't know. All I know is they've killed their orderly and I have orders to find them.
Drive carefully, Dr Branton. There'll be a lot of vehicles in the area tonight.
- Cornelius, what have you done?
- I didn't mean to kill him.
He was teasing Zira, and I thought I'd just hit him with a tray. Please believe me.
I do, Cornelius, I do. But they won't.
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there, hiding in the bushes.
Stevie, she's in labor.
Oh, God. Get in.
Stevie... you won't take us back to the camp?
Get down. I have a better idea.
Now wait a second. Just a moment.
Let me get this straight.
You are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugitive apes?
The answer is a thousand times yes. Oh, yes.
I do it for you. And for Stevie.
- And for your two distinguished friends.
- Notorious now.
To hell with notoriety!
What is a husband expected to do?
Stand by and see his wife insulted?
Good God! Aren't we rude enough to each other without having to be rude to animals?
And, anyway, he didn't mean to kill the boy. It was an accident.
I appreciate what you're doing, Armando.
Well, you helped deliver our last baby and now you will deliver our next.
Lewis! What took you so long?
I had to work out some excuse.
They think I'm searching.
- Armando's been a saint.
- Oh, a minor one.
- Saint Francis would have fixed it better.
- Never!
Say hello to Heloise.
- And your goddaughter, Salome.
- Hello, Salome.
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.
- No, Los Angeles has had four.
- Los Angeles is not a circus. It's a zoo.
- So New Yorkers say.
Lewis is here.
Lewis. I was not responsible for the death...
I know. But you will be responsible for a birth.
- How is she?
- The pains are every five minutes now.
Every four.
Look. Look at Heloise.
She's showing an expectant mother what to expect.
Mama.
Say it.
Don't waste your breath and strength.
You know that the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak.
I'm getting into practice.
There, that's good.
Come on.
What are we gonna call...
Him.
Milo?
Congratulations.
No?
But, sir...
Captain, I'm fully aware that you've canvassed the areas we first established.
Evidently we were wrong because you haven't found them yet!
Thank you.
Now, Dr Dixon, can you pinpoint the date of the baby's birth with any degree of accuracy?
Well, I never examined her.
But, from appearances,
I'd say a week to ten days.
If it's that close, she can't have gone far. Where do apes go?
To other apes.
Of course.
Captain, start an immediate and systematic search of every menagerie, every zoo, every circus in the city.
I'll augment your force with the city police.
And keep me informed about results,
- whether positive or negative.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, Lewis will think of something.
- I am so sorry. I had planned it all so well.
In just one month, we move on to our winter quarters in Florida.
I could have released you in the Everglades and, my dear friends, you might have lived happily ever after.
But now... what can I do?
You have done enough to make us grateful to you for ever.
I did it because I like chimpanzees best of all apes.
And you, the best of all chimpanzees.
I did it because I hate those who try to alter destiny, which is the unalterable will of God.
And if it is man's destiny one day to be dominated, then, oh, please, God, let him be dominated by such as you.
All I can now do to help you is give you this... for the baby.
- It's a medal of Saint Francis ofAssisi.
- Who is he?
He was a holy man who loved and cared for all animals.
Oh, thank you.
We'll hang it around the baby's neck. For protection, huh?
- Thank you.
- Yes.
And now, my dear, dear friends, before the police come and the audience gathers, you and your pretty baby must go.
Lewis is on his way.
- Armando.
- Yes?
I should like to say goodbye to Heloise first.
If only she could speak, she would say how sorry she is.
I know. But we understand each other.
All right.
This is as far as we dare to take you.
The police have road blocks on every main exit from town.
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.
- Can you read a map?
- I'm an archaeologist.
I can even draw one.
All right. We're at the city limits, at the southern edge of this oil field here.
Once you're over this hill there are more oil wells, an abandoned refinery and a harbor down to the southeast.
It's a kind of graveyard for old ships that have become unseaworthy.
I used to play there as a kid. Anyway, there's a derelict tanker at one end.
- You could hide there for a week.
- A week?
Until the commotion dies down a bit and we can smuggle you back to the circus.
Then, as Armando says, you can travel with them to Florida, found your own colony in the Everglades and live happily ever after.
It's time that you were moving on.
- Lewis.
- Yes?
If they find us... we shall be killed?
Ultimately.
Then... give us the opportunity to kill ourselves if that moment should come.
Please?
I shouldn't do this, but I guessed you might ask.
You're the second human I've kissed.
And you are the first.
Come along, Zira! Now, don't dawdle.
- The ape with the kid?
- Heloise?
Oh, she's been with the circus seven years now.
And the baby's birth was registered 16 days ago.
Look how he's growing. The first chimpanzee ever to be born in a circus!
Do you realize what a distinction that is, huh?
It's like being the first fish to be born on dry land.
Nothing.
Or the first bird to be born without an egg.
It is like being the first baby to be born on the moon.
It's like being the...
- Negative!
- We'll catch "em sooner or later.
That's what I'm worried about - later.
Later we'll do something about pollution.
Later we'll tackle the population explosion.
Later we'll do something about the nuclear war.
We think we got all the time in the world.
How much time has the world got?
Somebody has to begin to care.
Oh! Like stars in space. Isn't it beautiful?
Yes, it is. From here.
We must move on.
Who found it?
The field superintendent on a service check.
It was hidden here in the workings.
I guess she didn't need this any more.
So why don't we get moving?
It's a big area.
We've called for helicopters.
- How long will they be?
- 20 minutes.
- Why so long?
- They're running down a fire report.
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter?
- They found Zira's suitcase.
- Did Lewis really play here?
- Oh, it was probably cleaner then.
It stinks of man.
Oh, no, no. That's oil. And dead fish.
Is that what man wanted oil for?
To kill fish?
You don't like them very much, do you?
- Who?
- Humans.
We've met hundreds since we've been here, and I trust... three.
- He wants feeding.
- Yes, well...
Well, there must be someplace cleaner than this.
I'll look around.
Cornelius?
I see you've had your baby, Zira.
The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care.
Give it to me.
Cornelius!
Stevie.
Zira.
I want that baby.
If you won't give it to me, I'll shoot.
My God, stop him!
No!
Keep your men here! Come on!
What's she doing?
Oh, my God.
All hands on the guy lines.
Drop the bail ring!
All right, all extra hands in the back yards to the quarter poles! On the double.
As soon as you get that canvas packed,
I want every hand in the menagerie tent.
Intelligent creature.
Red Two to Topkick.
Stand by.
Red Two reporting, sir.
Slater here.
General, all personnel dead, sir.
No enemy force on site.
The only security breach a civilian van on the base, but no driver to be found.
Any evidence this is a preemptive CW strike?
No, sir.
Coming in.
Go on in.
Sergeant.
Who the hell are you?
Relax, Major. Please take your finger off the trigger and I will explain.
That your van out by the gate?
Yeah.
How did you get into the complex?
It's a complicated story. It starts a year ago, but let's skip that.
Let me tell you about last night and this morning.
Search him.
What's that?
Man your positions.
Sunflower seeds.
Get it analyzed.
Who is this?
The van driver, sir.
What the hell is he doing here?
Unidentified force. Range, 30 miles.
Closing from what direction?
Not closing. Outgoing.
Check him out...
...and tell him to put his hands down.
Yes, sir.
What have you got?
Estimated speed, 7 miles per hour.
Seven?
Whatever it is, it's big.
Slater to Air Search One.
Contact and identify outgoing objects, bearing 183 degrees.
Distance, 30 miles. Estimated speed, 7 miles per hour.
Repeat, that's 7 miles per hour, not 700.
Air Search One to
Topkick, roger.
Air Search One to Topkick.
We have visual contact.
Identify.
A black mass. A moving black mass!
Zero altitude, dead ahead.
They're hitting us!
Oh, my God!
We're out of control!
Oh, my God! Bees! Millions of bees!
Air Search Two to Base.
Bees! Millions of bees!
Bees?
They're all around me now! All over the canopy, trying to get in!
Get above them, man! Take it up!
I can't, sir. I'm losing power!
Oh, my God!
He's down, sir.
Good Lord!
Call Hastings Air Force Base. Have them scramble and track those bees.
Major! Bring him in here!
This is Capt. Cord at the missile complex.
This is a top-priority order from Gen.
Slater.
Scramble aircraft and track a swarm of bees 30 miles from the complex.
Yes, bees!
Now, what's his story?
Bradford Crane, sir.
That all?
Ph. D., Institute of Advanced
Study, Princeton, via Cambridge.
English?
American, for the last eight years.
Dr. Crane...
...you're in big trouble.
What are you doing in this complex?
I saw the swarms early this morning.
There were so many they almost blotted out the sun.
I followed them, but when I got here they were gone.
Then I saw the missile gates open and
I thought they'd flown down here.
I came to see if anybody was alive, if I could help.
In his van?
Scientific equipment.
What kind? Sabotage, explosives?
Biological. We're checking it out.
Who are you?
I'm an entomologist.
Bugs?
Insects. What I do is not important.
What is important, critical...
...is that there are other swarms, and what these bees did here...
...they can do all over the Southwest...
...and ultimately all over the country.
Are you saying bees killed the men here?
Yes. Just like your choppers.
I don't know what happened to those yet.
I do know thousands of people are stung by bees every year.
It's rare if anybody dies from bee stings!
They have to be African, don't they?
African killer bees?
Yes.
I've read their progress reports.
If they ever manage to come this far north, it's 10 years away at the earliest.
By whose timetable,
General, yours or theirs?
Either you're some crackpot...
...or there's a direct tie-up between what's happened here and you!
We can clear that up, and we'd better!
Kick on your com system and connect to Dr.
Connors in the White House.
Arthur Connors, the President's advisor?
That's him.
Are you trying to cite him as your authority for being in this complex?
Dr. Connors hasn't the foggiest idea whether I'm on or under this complex.
But I have to speak to him right now!
Lock him up!
Yes, sir.
General, thank God you got here, sir.
What?
This is Dr. Anderson.
She managed to get six men into the hospital in time to isolate them.
Two are dead, the others are critical.
I need antitoxins.
I have cardiopep compound in my van.
Cardiopep?
I just read an article about cardiopep...
...by some scientist named Crane, I think.
Our preliminary results are encouraging.
You're Crane?
Yes. Our tests indicate cardiopep normalizes irregular heartbeat.
Now, wait a minute. We're not using experimental substances on these men.
This is his area. It seems to me if he feels-
I don't give a damn! You're the doctor!
Tell me what you need.
I'll have them here in 30 minutes.
That's the problem. I don't know.
None of the usual procedures help.
I need to talk to an immunologist.
Get the Center for Disease
Control on the horn.
The best immunologist in the country is Walter Krim in Virginia.
You'll find his card in my wallet.
Call him.
Go ahead.
I know him very well.
I'd be pleased to talk to him.
All right. Go with him.
What happened here, Captain?
I'm sorry. You mean you don't know?
Not exactly.
We were attacked by bees.
Attacked?
I was in the hospital bunker when I heard the alarm.
I turned on the video control unit, saw what was happening.
Our men above ground were literally covered with bees.
I used an air-conditioning duct to get to
Pod Three and lead the standby crew out.
The bees attacked us when we reached the hospital bunker.
I managed to get six men inside.
It's damn hard to believe...
...that insects have accomplished what nothing in the world could've done...
...except germ warfare or a neutron bomb:
Neutralize an ICBM site.
Okay, let's go. Come on, Paul.
All right.
Isn't this beautiful?
Neat.
Here, Paul, take this.
Here you go, hon.
Thanks, babe.
Paul, look at that over there.
I think there's a waterfall we can go to after.
Hand me the cups, please.
Sure.
Would you go to the car and get the thermos?
Sure, Mom.
Go away.
It's just a bee. Leave him alone.
They're into everything.
I'll get them. Get out of the way, honey.
I think that's enough, you'll wreck the food. I'm hungry.
It's hot.
Hey, wait for Paul.
I can't. I'm starving.
Mom, Dad! Look!
Dad! Come on, get in the car.
Mom!
Dad!
Mom!
Mom!
Dad!
Gen. Thompson coming on-screen.
General, we've received and decoded your report.
We're having credibility problems with the nature of the attack.
Specifically, with your statement it was not a chemical warfare strike.
We can find no evidence of that, sir.
Your suggestion is the attack is of natural origin. What is that?
I'm having the same problem accepting that swarms of bees attacked-
Has that civilian been cleared, General?
No, sir.
What is he doing in our complex?
When I arrived with my special defense unit, he was already inside the complex.
He claims he walked in through the open gate.
I am Dr. Brad Crane, an entomologist.
I asked your man here to check my credentials with Dr. Arthur Connors.
So far, nobody believes me. I have been placed in custody.
Every minute now is precious.
We have been invaded by an enemy far more lethal than any human force.
Dr. Crane, we're going to check with the White House.
Dr. Connors had better know you, for your sake.
'Afternoon, Felix.
'Afternoon, ma'am.
How are you feeling today?
Now that you're here, just fine.
Nicely said.
Everything's looking pretty,
Maureen, including you.
Thank you, Clarence. The wire and the pliers, please.
Felix, think that rigging is going to keep my banner up?
Just because you're mayor of Marysville doesn't make you an engineer.
Don't be worrying about my rigging.
She'll stay up in a hurricane.
I was thinking how corny your banner reads.
Makes us look like hicks.
Nobody asked you to leave Houston and retire here, you know.
Clarence, that's not nice.
We've been doing fine with our flower festival for years...
...until this master mechanic genius came to tell us how to run things.
Actually, the sign is sort of hicky.
That's what people expect.
The hammer, too. That's why thousands flock here each year...
...to see the parade and our beautiful flower floats.
That's right. We'll grant you,
Felix, this isn't Pasadena.
It isn't the Rose Bowl. It's a pretty fair country-town imitation!
I'll tell you one thing
I do approve of.
This year's theme: Love.
Now that was Clarence's idea.
That's right.
Everybody's got to have one good idea now and then...
...even Clarence.
Now look, Felix-
Mom, Dad.
This way! Quick!
They killed my mom and my dad!
Yes, sir.
We'll do the best we can, sir, and thank you, sir.
Gen. Thompson coming on-screen.
Dr. Crane, your credentials have been authenticated.
Nothing more?
While I confess to being surprised at events...
...but the President has placed you in direct command...
...of all operations relating to this present emergency.
What are the limits to my authority?
None.
Gen. Slater.
Yes, sir.
You will provide Dr. Crane with full cooperation.
You will give him equipment, whatever facilities and manpower he needs.
All this is to be made available to him without question.
Without question, sir?
Affirmative.
Dr. Crane.
Yes.
The President's advisor, Dr.
Connors...
...told me he'll be calling you within an hour...
...and I'd like to join with him in wishing you good luck.
Thank you.
Major, when you checked the non-lethal equipment in my van...
...did you come across a beat-up briefcase?
Yes, sir.
Are you familiar with its contents?
Yes, sir. An inventory of the contents is in the process of being typed.
Correction, sir.
Was being typed.
Thank you. I want the particular file that I'd marked "Personnel"...
...to give to Gen. Slater.
Yes, sir.
While you're about it, could
I have my leather pouch?
The one with the sunflower seeds.
Sergeant...
...would you get the items he requested?
The file contains the names, addresses and numbers of everyone I want flown in.
Just tell them the war I've always talked about has finally started.
That's all? They'll drop everything?
I'm counting on it.
Anything else?
Yes. In that same briefcase...
...there is a list of equipment. Get the Pentagon's top procurement man...
...and get everything on that list flown here not later than tomorrow.
Why here?
We're setting up headquarters here.
Time is the one thing we're short on.
Now, I want to talk to the survivors, please.
Take Dr. Crane to Capt. Anderson.
Yes, sir. Come with me, please.
Brother.
Major...
...you were an investigative officer in Intelligence previously, right?
That's correct, sir.
Okay, I'm assigning you to this Dr.
Crane...
...as his personal military liaison.
Watch every move he makes.
Build me a dossier on him.
I can't believe he just happened to be here at the moment...
...a swarm of bees hit this complex...
...and that he'd already prepared with such remarkable foresight...
...a list of personnel and equipment to be flown in here.
It does seem strange, sir.
Stay with the son of a bitch.
Yes, sir.
This man is the most stable, but his heart rate is still 120.
Take another blood sample just before Dr.
Krim gets here.
That would be three hours at the outside.
Infirmary, Major Baker.
Hold on a minute.
Capt. Anderson?
Dr. Anderson.
Oh, my God!
I'm leaving right now.
What is it?
The bees are moving towards Marysville.
They killed all the Durants except Paul.
I must go to him.
I'll go with you. Major, you drive.
Paul Durant.
C-4.
Thank you.
There's a bee in here!
Please, help!
There's a bee in here!
Relax, Paul. Take it easy.
Get him away! Kill him!
Paul!
Doctor, would you let him go, please?
Do what he says, Tomas.
Back away.
Paul? Listen to me.
There is no bee in this room.
Yes, there is.
You are having a nightmare.
Only a nightmare.
Can you hear me, Paul?
The bee is not real.
Paul, I promise you it isn't.
Now, reach out and it will go away.
You'll see.
Now please, Paul, reach out.
Reach out, Paul.
Please trust me.
Reach out. Further. Go on.
There. You see, Paul?
No bee.
Everything I tried failed.
I was afraid I was going to lose him.
I know how special he is to you, so I called you.
Thank you.
How many times was he stung?
I removed two stingers.
That's one break.
He's not full of venom.
But he's delirious...
...muttering about this giant bee.
It was big! It was really big.
About half the size of this room!
He's gone now. It was only in your mind, and he won't be back.
I have to go.
Dr. Crane...
...thank you for helping me.
Contact the complex, please.
Two things:
Gen. Slater must assign helicopters to start a search pattern...
...radiating from the site where the Durants were attacked.
The helicopters must take no aggressive action if they spot a swarm.
We're gathering information, not counterattacking.
Clear?
Clear.
Second item: Have the complex call me the moment Dr. Krim is about to land.
Here come your choppers, as ordered.
Thank you, General.
No, thanks.
High in potassium, low in sodium.
Terrific.
Sergeant, start your patterns.
Start your dispersal pattern in sectors A and B.
Report immediately any sighting of swarms.
Roger.
Tell us what you're looking for, we'll try to help.
I'm looking for bees.
Unfortunately, they washed down the
Durant car before we got to it.
Look.
Doesn't look like a bee to me.
Plastic.
It's a piece of a plastic cup.
There are pieces all around here.
Look. There, there.
What's so significant about that?
I'm afraid to speculate...
...but I think the bees did this.
You're saying these bees eat plastic?
No. But I'm wondering.
Your American honey bee has a weak mouth.
It couldn't even break the skin of a grape.
But it looks like this species is tearing up plastic cups...
...possibly to line their hives.
Now, if this is true, they didn't just get here.
I mean, the invasion didn't just now begin.
They have been here some time.
Breeding. Increasing.
So?
Suppose these bees...
...are using plastic to insulate their hives.
No bee is that smart.
Suppose these African bees are.
Walter!
Got a message for you from Mrs.
Krim.
Carol is furious at me for dragging you back to work.
She wonders if you think I'm the only immunologist in the world.
That's what you've always told me.
Ready to go to work, Dr. Krim?
Now I am, Dr. Crane.
This is Gen. Slater.
Just let me know what you need.
Thank you. We've got to move fast.
I agree...
...and in my opinion, the fastest move is a quick knockout.
Not necessarily, General.
It's only the final result that counts.
Thank you, Brad.
The hallucinations seem to be disappearing.
That's right.
None of the patients have had a recurrence in the past few hours.
You're doing everything you can for them.
Keep these IVs going.
Yes, sir.
Is there any other antitoxin we could've used?
If he is right and the bees that stung them were African...
...the answer's probably no.
Got nothing in our bag for them.
Not yet anyway.
Cardiopep might have eased their palpitations...
...but it's no final antidote.
Call me if there's any change in these men.
They don't look very good, do they?
I'm afraid not.
You still refuse to oil this?
I don't intend to be stuck in this thing forever.
Have you finally met some miracle healer?
I'm studying Tibetan levitation.
In a few hundred years, I expect to be able to float around.
You still writing dirty books?
Not this year.
Raunchiest thing I ever read...
...that paper of yours on the mating habits of Bombus medius.
Those queen bees really are something.
Sergeant, this is Dr. Krim.
The two officers with Major Baker are Drs.
Richards and Moore.
Until they finish their work, you don't admit anyone.
Have someone oil these wheels later.
You okay, Brad?
Yeah.
Go on. I'll handle this part and call you when I'm ready.
Walter...
...thanks for coming over here so quickly.
Problem, Doctor?
About what?
I noticed that Dr. Crane seemed uneasy in here.
Can't imagine why anyone would be uneasy around all these dead men.
Can you, Major?
Is the man coming or isn't he?
Yes, sir, the general is coming, but you have to wait outside.
What's this about shutting off our water?
Are you in charge?
Yes, I'm Gen. Slater.
I'm Jud Hawkins.
I asked these tin soldiers if I could see my son...
...and they tell me it's impossible.
Who's your son? Why do you think he's here?
Because he was stupid enough to join your damn outfit.
His name is Mark.
Airman Mark Hawkins.
He's stationed here.
I want to see him.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Not yet.
I'll tell you what makes it possible:
Me being the county engineer.
That makes it possible. Do you understand me, General?
Out of the question!
I control all the damn water in this county...
...and by God, I'll shut yours off unless I get to see my son!
I'll shut this whole base down in 10 minutes.
You won't even have enough water to flush your toilets when I'm through.
I'm not sure you have the authority to do that to a federal installation.
While you're checking with your superiors to find out if I have the authority...
...I'll be turning those valves.
Now, you listen to me.
Word is, them same bees that killed the Durant family...
...killed a whole lot of men on this base this morning.
I want to see my son.
I want to find out if he's alive, and I mean right now!
All right, Mr. Hawkins.
Open it up.
Come with me.
Anything?
The toxic content in their tissue is the highest I've ever found.
It's more virulent than the venom of the Australian brown box jellyfish.
If that baby taps you, you have two minutes to say your prayers.
That's it, then?
Looks like your nightmare has finally arrived.
The combined venom delivered by three or more of these bees...
...may be a fatal dosage to the average human being.
The victim would be unconscious in a minute.
We've been losing the battle against the insects for 15 years...
...but I never thought I'd see the final face-off in my lifetime.
And I never dreamed that it would turn out to be the bees.
They've always been our friends.
Until this species evolved.
Gen. Slater is outside with the next of kin of one of the dead men.
He wants to come in here?
He said it was imperative.
All right.
Oh, God! No!
I'm afraid you can't take him, Mr.
Hawkins.
The only way you can stop me is to shoot me...
...and I'd thank you if you would.
Hubbard. Dr. Newman.
Thanks for coming.
Glad to help.
You should know I came here reluctantly.
That's better than not at all, now isn't it?
This way, gentlemen.
Would you excuse me a moment?
When the others arrive, give them 30 minutes to unpack...
...then have them go to the briefing room.
Very well.
Gentlemen.
Rude son of a bitch, isn't he?
Never even introduced us.
You'd think he was a general.
He's asked for the duty watch tapes.
Why?
He seems to know there's an automatic taping system in the duty room.
He wants to audit the tape just prior to the attack.
I've already played it back.
Nothing that'll help us.
But let him hear it.
Stay with him. Build up that dossier.
Yes, sir.
So, what about Rita?
She's been slinging hash long enough.
I'm gonna marry her.
Guys don't do that, just because they're having a kid.
I love Rita. I'd marry her whether we were gonna have a kid or not.
At the tone, mark 0430.
It says we're scheduled to test the alarm system...
...right after the 0430 mark.
Stand by. Activating.
What alarm system is that?
A fallback...
...in case we lose the phone lines or radio contact.
What's that?
Just the alarm.
No, listen.
Jerry, do you hear what I'm hearing?
Yeah.
Duty officer. Right away, sir.
...like a couple of million chain saws!
That came from the corridor.
Cover me. I'll go look.
Jerry! Behind you!
My God!
Dr. Crane, they're ready for you now.
Okay.
Keep the tapes on the machine.
I want to hear them again.
How's Paul?
Recovering, thank you.
That's good.
Good morning, ladies, gentlemen.
Please forgive the haste and secrecy with which you've been summoned here.
The fact is, we've been invaded by a mutant species of the African killer bee.
Crane, if I may.
Yes, Dr. Hubbard?
I was sent by the President to help, but I think you're dead wrong.
I was one of the first people sent to Brazil...
...when the African killer bee began proliferating there.
We prefer to call these mutants the Brazilian bee, not African.
I'm well aware of that, Dr.
Hubbard.
I've been tracking their progress north...
...and there is no evidence whatsoever...
...that they've yet crossed Central
America, let alone arrived here.
Apparently, they came directly across the Caribbean from Venezuela.
There were three hurricanes in that ocean tract this season.
Any one of them could have swept the bees in.
Much of this land is used to cultivate flowers.
A perfect breeding ground.
With all appropriate respect to the men who died here...
...there is no proof the bees that killed them were Brazilian.
Or, if you insist, African.
What they're called isn't as important as what they are.
And what they are clearly is a mutant species of the original African killer bee.
Dr. Krim will explain.
The autopsies confirm that the venom...
...is deadlier than anything we've ever encountered.
It appears there's enough poison in just four stings...
...to kill the average person.
I won't dispute my learned colleague, but...
...it takes 26 tests to identify the African bee.
How many tests have you made so far?
Major.
You're looking at the final test I made this morning...
...from the one dead bee that we found.
Notice the 18-vein intersection on the fore-wing...
...and the 17 separate angles of the hamuli.
Only one bee has that configuration...
...and that is the
African killer bee.
Major.
Dr. Hubbard...
...I would appreciate it if you would head up our environmental team.
Dr. Newman will be in charge of the genetic counterattack.
Dr. Krim will try to develop a mass antidote...
...to save the lives of future victims.
Because of the danger to nearby
Marysville, if the bees attack again...
...I've invited Mayor Tuttle and
School Superintendent Ms. Schuster...
...to attend this briefing.
Any comment?
Mayor Tuttle.
Thank you.
In view of what you've told us,
I'll set up a town council meeting.
I'll see that our air-raid warning system is repaired.
It hasn't worked in some time.
If the bees come back, at least we can warn people to take shelter.
A very practical approach.
Ms. Schuster.
The idea of those killer bees coming back is petrifying.
I'll alert all my teachers to be prepared for the worst.
I appreciate your thoughtfulness in asking us to this briefing.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
You're welcome, Ms. Schuster.
Any further comment?
What's our timetable?
Eight-hour shifts, around the clock, seven days a week.
I meant, what's the length of our program?
How long can we expect to be here?
Until we have destroyed the African bee...
...or it has destroyed us.
You guys ready?
Yeah!
Give me the binoculars and let's go.
Okay.
'Morning!
Hi, boys!
'Morning, Rita.
'Morning, Mr. Austin.
Instead of the usual,
I'll just have coffee.
All right.
I'll get it, Rita.
'Morning, Felix!
A man would think you'd let her have some time off.
At least let her go to the missile base...
...and pick up Jerry's things.
I told her!
I even said to her, "Rita..."
"... go home for a few days and pull yourself together."
And she said:
"If I went home, and stared at them four walls, knowing Jerry's gone..."
"...I'm just liable to take his service pistol and blow my head off."
She said that.
She's better off pretending it never happened.
Pretending them killer bees never got up here.
I bet I can guess what schoolteacher them roses belong to.
You don't need no crystal ball for that.
The way I hear it, Maureen is favoring you over Clarence.
I sure am counting on it.
Yes, sir. The gossip is...
...the odds have shifted in your favor.
Now, them is my kind of odds.
I gotta be going.
So soon?
Yeah, but I'll be seeing you.
Have a good day.
Oh, Maureen.
'Morning, Felix.
I got you some roses.
Oh, Felix. They are lovely.
I usually get apples.
Oh, Maureen. I...
Something wrong, Felix?
I'm not too good with words...
...but I am a retired master mechanic...
...and my education, well...
...it's all in these hands.
And I know you know what I'm trying to say.
Your roses speak for you.
Most eloquently.
Thank you.
And I'm mindful of it.
Then there is hope for me?
Oh, look at the time.
I'd better hurry.
How'd it look for me to be late for school?
Let me help you.
And I'll keep your roses near me.
As a reminder.
Thank you.
I'll see you real soon.
You will.
'Bye.
'Bye.
We'll come back later.
We have to plan this just right.
These aren't just any old bees.
This is your reporter
Anne MacGregor.
We're heading for Marysville to investigate the report...
...of a savage attack by bees at a family picnic.
It resulted in the death of a mother and father, and serious injury to their son.
My next report...
Kill it.
Yes, sir.
We've picked up a huge swarm.
On this scale, that puts it only 200 miles from Houston.
I can have choppers there in half an hour, eliminate them before they get away.
With what?
Airborne chemical agents.
May we talk? Alone?
Sure.
I don't recall our discussion about the use of chemicals.
Now, listen.
My orders are to assist you in your scientific endeavors...
...not to consult with you on military matters...
...which are none of your damn concern, sir!
General, please.
These bees are of joint concern.
They kill Americans without regard for whether or not they should salute you.
There will be no airdrops of any kind until I give the okay.
Your okay, huh?
Then perhaps I can persuade you to attack this particular swarm.
Now that we know where it is.
Attack and eliminate it!
Possibly, if you can explain to me...
...how you airdrop chemicals without killing native insects.
If your chemical kills the African bee it'll also kill the American bee, right?
Right. Better a few American bees than a lot of American people.
That is the point, General!
The honey bee is vital to the environment!
In America, they pollinate
$6 billion worth of crops!
Killing the bee kills the crop! Killing the plants will kill the people!
No! No, General!
There will be no airdrop until we know what we're dropping...
...and where and how!
Excuse me.
What about the airdrop, sir?
Sir?
...the 0430 mark.
Stand by. Activating.
Jerry, do you hear what I'm hearing?
Yeah.
What is it?
Sounds like a couple of million chain saws!
That came from the corridor.
Cover me. I'll go look.
Jerry! Behind you!
My God!
Oh, God, no! No!
Come on, let's get them!
We've got to kill them this time!
Ready, now!
Let's get out of here!
I can't imagine where he's gone.
We've looked everywhere.
He's been running a fever.
I returned him to the clinic after the funeral, but then he disappeared.
We'll find him.
With everything else you have on your shoulders, you didn't need this.
I know I'm taking you away from all your responsibilities.
Paul is one of them.
Besides, I like being with you.
You're the one good thing that's happened to me here.
I like that. I really do.
What is it?
Look.
The bees.
They're heading toward Marysville.
I'll beat you outside!
No, you won't.
Now, Miss Cook?
In a minute, Mr. Tuttle.
Is this what you want?
No, I need a note from your mother.
Now, Mr. Tuttle.
Thank you.
Would you excuse me?
That'd be all right.
Well, Clarence, who's minding the store?
Maureen, how long have we known each other?
Maybe you'd better sit down.
No, thanks, I'll stand. How long?
I remember you in short pants...
...but I don't want to figure out how long ago that was.
In all that time, have you ever heard me beg?
Not you, Clarence.
You're the original high-spirited, independent soul.
Well, Maureen, I'm willing to beg now.
Yes? Blue will do.
Where was I? Oh, yes.
Maureen, I want you to marry me.
Oh, Clarence, do sit down.
Name the date and I'll make all the arrangements.
I'm not sure I'm the wife you need.
You'd be the best wife in the world.
Clarence, I think I'm already married, completely married to this school.
Maureen, I love you.
I know people think I'm just an old man behind the aspirin counter...
...but in my heart I'm as young as I ever was, maybe younger.
And I want to take care of you.
Thank you, Clarence.
I guess I have to choose, don't I?
I guess that's about what it comes down to.
Please hold the calls.
I know I may not win out...
...because, though I pretend
I can't stand Felix...
...I know he's a fine man and he'd make a good husband.
But I know one thing.
I love you.
I always have, and
I always will...
...no matter what you decide.
How lucky I am.
All right.
I'll give you both my answer before the end of this school term.
How's that?
That's fair enough, I guess.
I brought these for you.
Thank you.
Why did they send us varsity here?
Any stringer could cover this story.
You're wrong. This isn't just about a family killed by bees.
Something else is going on.
I can feel it.
We're the first national news team here.
Okay, Anne, if you say so.
Let's check in.
Get back.
I've got it right here in front of me.
The African bees!
The African bees that killed
Paul's parents are back!
Get everyone inside, and lock up!
Call the park! Call the ball field!
I'll call the school!
Get inside! The bees are coming!
Get inside! The killer bees are coming!
Those bees are coming.
Get all the kids into the building.
Don't you understand? The killer bees are coming!
Get inside!
Get all the children inside!
Quickly, get inside! Take your children with you!
If you see any children alone, take them in!
Keep all the vents closed and don't let anybody out until I tell you.
I understand.
I'll do it immediately.
Attention. Attention.
This is Ms. Schuster. Please listen very carefully.
A swarm of killer bees is coming this way.
I want every teacher and every student...
...to close off whatever area you may be in at this very moment.
Children! It's all right.
Quiet.
Here they come! Inside, fast!
Get it all on tape!
Close your windows and doors!
Stay inside! Please, listen to us!
Run!
Brad!
Get some ice!
They're coming in here!
Is there a freezer?
This way.
Get in it.
Mr. Harris! He's locked it!
Is he crazy?
He's afraid of everything!
Aren't we safe in here?
I don't know.
No, the air conditioning's on.
They'll come through the vents.
Just a minute.
It's 40 degrees in here.
We'll be all right.
Bees don't function well in temperatures under 50.
Helena!
Anne MacGregor reporting from Marysville.
The swarm left behind a devastated community.
The town is reeling under the impact of the vicious raid...
...that left many of their friends and relations dead.
Marysville was preparing for its annual flower festival.
Authorities speculate the nearby fields-
This is Frank Blair.
We await a statement from the
President's top advisor, Dr. Connors.
Dr. Connors is evaluating data from Bradford Crane...
...the leading authority on the deadly African bee.
Crane is now at the scene of the tragedy.
Dr. Krim.
Did you locate him?
We're trying to get through on our mobile units. Stand by.
Every opening into homes, churches, schools and offices is being closed.
Scientific authorities are warning against overreacting to the threat.
Scientists believe this tragedy is a freak, localized phenomenon...
...and could not possibly be repeated.
Take it easy. Okay, there we go.
Come this way.
Clear the way.
Hello.
Krim here.
Hi, it's Brad.
I just heard about Helena.
Is she all right?
Still unconscious.
Not good.
How are things back there?
Damned unsettling development here.
One of those four survivors of the initial attack...
Yes?
...Higgins, the airman...
...with only two stings, he just died.
What happened?
He was doing fine.
I was thinking of releasing him.
Within minutes, his condition turned critical. All the classical signs...
...of cardiovascular failure. He was gone before we could reverse it.
Keep the survivors there until we can plot a recovery vs. relapse pattern.
How bad is it in Marysville?
About as bad as it can get.
216 dead, 33 victims still alive.
We don't know how many stings per victim.
We're too busy stabilizing them.
Dr. Crane.
I'm sorry. I've got to go, Walter.
Is it me you're seeing, or a bee?
You.
Dr. Crane.
Yes?
Gen. Slater is on the horn with Washington.
He requests your presence.
All right. I'll be back.
I'll be up.
No, you won't.
Paul, what's the matter?
It's all my fault.
I threw firebombs at the swarm.
You're going to have to tell Dr.
Crane.
I'd like to, General, but Crane is in charge.
I just follow orders.
We'll check them out here.
Right. I'll keep in touch.
General.
Crane, it's panic time from coast to coast!
If we'd gone after the bees right at the start...
...instead of wasting time with your science teams...
...we wouldn't be in this damn mess!
Okay, what would you do?
I'd evacuate this area, put up roadblocks across the state...
...and spray the hell out of every tree and bush from here to the Gulf!
Let's take that a piece at a time.
Why evacuate?
Dr. Hubbard was out collecting live African bees.
He's brought them back to the complex.
Thousands.
How?
They were on the surface of the lake.
Thirsty and exhausted.
Good, we need specimens.
Hold it! I don't see it that way.
The rest of that swarm could still be in the area.
Major, get the final body count.
Yes, sir.
General, you haven't answered my question.
What question?
Why evacuate?
I've been trying to tell you.
When that swarm finds that their friends have been taken captive...
...they might come back to Marysville.
Are you endowing the bees with human motives? Like rescuing their fellow bees?
Or seeking revenge on mankind?
I always credit my enemy, no matter what he may be...
...with equal intelligence.
Okay, evacuate Marysville, but not the complex.
We won't waste time moving facilities!
Agreed.
Now, about this spraying every bush and tree between here and the Gulf.
How will you manage that?
Send out aircraft.
With radar and pesticides, I'd destroy every African swarm in this country...
...wherever they are!
Major?
232 dead, sir.
232 dead.
I know that, General!
How will you prevent the wind from carrying pesticides...
...across cities, parks, farms and schools?
Sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils.
Ridiculous, General!
You want action and so do I!
We will do it my way!
Now, give it a chance!
Dr. Crane!
I gotta talk to you.
Okay.
It was my fault...
...what happened here with the bees.
I knew where they were...
...and I should've told you.
Why didn't you?
Because they killed my family!
I wanted to get them.
And I did, I got a lot of them.
Then the rest of them flew in the air and...
Hey, Paul.
Come on.
I'd have done the same thing.
The exact same thing.
You gotta believe me.
Now, look at me, Paul.
Look at me.
When I was a little younger than you...
...just about seven...
...we had a fire where we lived.
I lost my mother and father that night.
It's not good to have to grow up without a mother and father.
You can ask me. I know firsthand.
I know a lot of unlucky kids all over the world have to...
...but it sure isn't recommended.
Now...
...why don't you go back upstairs...
...and sort of keep an eye on Dr.
Anderson for me?
Will you do that?
Okay.
Good boy.
Dr. Crane.
Yes?
Can you give us 90 seconds?
What can I tell you in 90 seconds?
Everything you can, no matter how long.
Give me a second for my lead-in.
This is Anne MacGregor outside the clinic in Marysville, Texas.
With me is Dr. Bradford Crane...
...who is field director for Dr. Connors, the President's science advisor.
How can you prevent this tragedy from happening elsewhere?
Do you have any answers?
At the moment, none.
Can the death toll from bee attacks spread?
That's a possibility.
What's the government doing? What are your science teams working on?
Positive ways to isolate and eliminate invading swarms.
What positive ways?
Can you be specific?
That's tough to do in 90 seconds.
Take all the time you want.
That's the point. I'm afraid we don't have any to spare. Excuse me, please.
Thank you.
Anne MacGregor,
Marysville, Texas.
DC ready, not exceeding five volts.
Testing five volts.
Good.
DC activated.
How's it going?
We'll be ready in a minute.
Honey-coated. Three volts at.
5 amps.
Okay, bring on the gladiators.
I'll stir them up.
Pesky little devils.
Spread them all over the grid.
They're getting ready to attack.
They're stinging the hell out of the grid.
We're getting plenty of venom now.
We need all we can get.
If there's a positive side to the tragedy...
...it's finding these
Africans and the queen bees.
With all this venom, I can really go to work on an antidote.
That's fine.
Hubbard, can you have your poison pellets ready by morning?
By morning?
I don't see how.
That makes your deadline even earlier, Walter.
Smells like bananas.
See how fast it dries.
Any further complications?
Dr. Anderson has just examined them.
They're doing well.
Dr. Anderson? When did she get back?
A short while ago, Major.
I couldn't rest knowing I had sick patients here.
Besides, Dr. Martinez says I'm fine.
Good.
Captain, I've been planning on having a private talk with you.
It's about this civilian, Crane.
I've received confidential reports about your association with him...
...which indicate your relationship is now of a personal nature.
I didn't know you'd assigned anyone to spy on me.
Has Crane asked you anything about our operations here, even indirectly?
Why should he?
He is a highly respected scientist...
...and has been appointed by the
President to head this project.
It still might be advisable for you to discontinue the relationship.
With all due respect, sir, what I do on my off-duty time is my business...
...and doesn't concern the Air Force.
I shall continue to see whomever I wish.
Thank you.
The doctor wants to say goodbye.
Doctor?
Oh, yes, Rita.
About the baby, you're both fine.
Oh, good.
Real fine.
Thank you.
Please sit down.
With everything happening, I haven't had a chance to say...
...how sorry I am about Jerry.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll write to you. Let you know about the baby.
Do you have a place to go?
Not really.
They just gave everyone orders to leave.
Of course, there isn't much to stay for, is there?
Goodbye. I have to go.
The bus is waiting.
Let me walk you to the door.
I'll see myself out. Goodbye.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Only one suitcase to a person, please.
Move it along.
Not since the '30s, when thousands fled the Oklahoma Dust Bowl...
...has a thriving American community been evacuated.
No flood, fire or hurricane has turned such a large section...
...into a no man's land, until today.
Slow down.
That's it. Move right along.
On the stairs, please!
Move forward.
Have you seen Ms. Schuster?
No, sir.
Continue up to the stairs.
Hal, have you seen Ms. Schuster?
No, sir, I haven't.
You boys lose something?
You never did have a good concept of time.
I remember on our first date we didn't see the whole double feature.
I was so afraid you wouldn't catch this train.
Here I am. Shall we go?
Yeah.
Let go. I had it first.
Look, I was carrying her books long before you showed up in Marysville. Let go!
Clarence, Felix!
You promised me there would be no more fussing.
And this surely isn't the time for it.
Let go!
All right. Follow the line.
...everything that they hold dear...
...because of killer bees.
Imagine having such a natural phenomenon do something-
Take this. Give me a hand with her.
Get her in the car.
Is the hospital here operating?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You all right?
It's better.
We'll get you there.
Thank you.
Hold on.
Hurry.
Enter the car with the number you've been issued. That car's number is five!
Let's get this train out of here.
The bees could be back any minute.
Where is Crane?
Don't worry, sir. He'll be here in time to take credit for the evacuation.
Let me tell you something, Major.
I don't tolerate my staff saying things behind a man's back.
If you think Crane's a glory jockey, tell him, not me.
If you're trying to butter me up by slurring a man I consider misguided...
...I don't need a pat on the ass from you or anyone else.
Yes, sir.
Am I walking too fast?
No, I'm fine. Just fine.
Don't overdo it.
Dr. Martinez said you had a close call.
How sad.
How very, very sad.
You know, Marysville was such a happy little town.
Ritz's Bookstore.
I used to work there when
I was in high school.
Everything was happy then.
But that was so long ago.
It's all right.
You can tell a lot about a man by the way he shuffles cards.
Thank you, Clarence.
Wasn't meant as a compliment.
Would you like to cut the cards?
Something bothering you?
What's wrong, Maureen?
I got a sudden feeling I'll never see Marysville again.
Or any of my children.
It's frightening.
Maureen, that's not like you.
You're an optimist.
Always looking at the bright side.
We'll be home soon...
...and this will all seem like a bad dream.
That's right.
I suppose that's so.
But I can't shake this feeling that something's closing in on us.
Now, now, Maureen.
Come on, deal, Felix.
Sandwiches?
No, thanks.
No, thank you.
Ed?
Yeah?
There's a bee in here.
A bee? Don't take any chances.
Maybe he wants the apple.
Then give it to him.
Goddamn! What will I do now?
Don't move.
Don't get him mad!
No, Charlie!
When are we going to stop this massacre?
Our first airdrop is in half an hour.
I've seen what you plan to drop!
Those damn poison pellets won't get us anywhere!
Those are my damn poison pellets, and they'll work!
I'm counting on them working, or we fall back to almost impossible odds:
My coming up with a mass antidote, which might never be perfected.
Thank you, gentlemen, for your support.
But, Captain...
...feed this into the computer.
African bees attack a train...
...70 miles northwest of Houston.
Now, give me a revised time fix, please.
I know how you feel, especially due to what just happened...
...but right now we are ready to drop millions of lethal pellets...
...without harming either the population or the plant life.
I'll support that.
So will I.
What we need...
...is every helicopter you have.
All right, you've got them.
Revised timetable coming through, sir.
They're not touching the pellets!
They're not touching the pellets!
They seem to sense it's something that will kill them.
They're brighter than I thought.
They always are.
Maybe you should have tried bourbon and water and got them drunk.
It's all my fault. I threw firebombs at the swarm.
It's all my fault. I threw firebombs at the swarm.
You've got a beautiful six-and-a-half pound beautiful daughter.
Thank you.
I guess it's true what they say...
...that a woman sort of falls in love with her doctor at this time.
I hope you will feel the same way tomorrow.
And the day after.
And all of the days after.
Paul!
Tomas!
Helena.
Why this one?
In the whole damned world, why this boy?
My God, Brad.
What good is all that science?
All that equipment at the base?
All those doctors?
What good are you?
I didn't mean that.
You know I didn't.
Paul was my first case when
I was the town doctor.
He wanted to be an archaeologist.
He would've been a terrific one.
I'm sure of it.
You didn't tell me three of the four survivors at the base had died.
You had other problems.
And you didn't tell me there's a syndrome of relapse among survivors...
...shortly after they've been stung.
A fatal relapse.
Some do recover.
A small percentage.
But some do.
Some.
The odds are better than none.
You've dropped your poison pellets and the Africans spit at them.
They're moving toward Houston faster than expected.
General, you should know the enemy is always expected to do the unexpected.
Dr. Crane.
Major Baker.
Let's hear your rundown.
"Three steel mills, seven oil refineries..."
"... two beet sugar plants and a nuclear power center."
"Plus 46 towns, not including Houston..."
"... are now directly in the path of the Africans."
We'll evacuate the towns, and close the factories.
I'll tell you now, we'll have trouble with the nuclear power plant.
They won't shut down voluntarily.
Millions in the area need the energy.
If we don't shut them down, the bees will.
I'll check with Washington, to try to get a directive.
I know most of the key executives at that plant.
I fought them in court often enough on environmental issues.
I'll fly in and try to jawbone some sense into them.
It might be a lot quicker than Washington.
Okay. You got it. Thank you.
Miss!
More bad news?
Everything we've tried has failed.
Our last hope is your mass antidote.
How close are you?
I've tried it on all these rabbits.
It knocks hell out of them.
These are the only two still alive.
I'm on the right track, but I need more time to experiment.
If you can't perfect it, we might just as well pack it in right away...
...and ship out to New Zealand.
What we need is something that people can self-inject...
...if they get stung by an African bee.
And we need it right now.
I get the picture. First thing tomorrow, I'll try it on a human.
Like who?
We'll come up with volunteers.
Like me?
Forget it.
It'll take a few days to convince them how much we need human guinea pigs.
Meanwhile, I'm here and I'm convinced.
I'm not ready for you, yet.
When I am, I'll let you know.
Okay.
Will you please start eating the food they serve here?
It has been measured to ensure you get energy for the long hours you work.
What the hell does a man have to do to get a beer and a pizza around here?
All a man has to do,
Walter, is ask.
All my notes are right here, Brad, on the desk next to the recorder.
They contain the exact instructions, and I mean exact...
...on how to prepare the antidote I've developed.
Every experiment, with its individual notes...
...and conclusions, is documented in this text.
I'm going to test the serum on myself.
Why?
Because you're fool enough to make me try it on you.
It's my antidote, so it'll be my risk.
First, I'm going to inject myself...
...with the same input of venom I'd receive from the stings of six bees.
That's double the amount anybody has been able to take and survive.
Then I'll see if I'll still be able to use the self-injector with my serum...
...or whether muscular stiffness will make it impossible.
I'll dictate the rest of this to the other recorder.
I'm all ready.
Physiograph is recording, everything is laid out.
The weal is rising instantly.
Now, from the moment of being stung, a frightened victim...
...medically inexperienced, would need about 60 seconds...
...to get the self-injector from pocket or purse...
...pull up a sleeve, waste seconds hesitating, afraid of the needle.
Finally, put it in. I'm going to give myself the same 60 seconds.
Heartbeat rising rapidly.
Heartbeat now 140.
The antidote is on the table in front of me.
Fifty-five seconds since I administered the venom.
I'm gonna start reaching for it.
It won't move.
My arm feels like it's strapped to my side.
Heartbeat...
Close to outer limit.
Dropping now.
Good.
Good!
Going to normal.
Dropping now.
Dr. Krim, what are you doing?
You missed the tough part.
How much did you take?
About six stings' worth.
Oh, Dr. Krim.
Respiration still high...
...but not abnormally so.
Let's see now.
I administered the antidote about...
...66 seconds after the venom was injected.
The antidote works.
My God. It works.
Dr. Krim.
Now here's something.
The four physiological responses...
...are swinging from norm to some really...
...spooky levels.
They don't want to stay down.
In fact, they're turning bad.
All of them.
Heart rate, rising again.
Oh, my God.
Losing...
...respiration.
First sign, respiratory arrest.
Doctor.
Walter.
Oh, Walter.
There it is.
I just don't understand your request.
You will.
Have you any idea of the consequences if I ask Washington to shut down?
Less disastrous than not shutting down.
Look at all this.
Don't you realize we supply power over a 500-mile area...
...and purify the drinking water of 7 million people?
I realize that. I don't think you realize how critical this is.
There's nothing here that could attract those bees.
Don't be so sure. The infrared rays could act like a beacon.
No, Doctor. See this.
Billions of dollars have been spent to make these nuclear plants fail-safe!
The odds against anything going wrong are astronomical.
I appreciate that, but let me ask you...
...in all your fail-safe techniques, is there a provision against killer bees?
Andrews here. Come in, Control.
Control, this is Andrews.
What's happening?
Control, go to manual!
The bees. Let's get out of here!
No! This way.
Crane?
Crane!
I've been authorized by the President to close down your operation.
From now on, the war against the Africans will be under military direction...
...the way it should've been from the first.
What's the ETA now?
General?
I'll say this for you,
Crane, you tried.
In spite of what you might think, I kind of hoped you'd pull it off.
Arrange protective crating for the two oscilloscopes, I'll fly them to Houston.
I'll see you there with the equipment.
I'll be there.
I haven't surrendered yet, General.
...estimating that 600,000 people have already been evacuated from Houston.
Elsewhere in the nation, people stayed indoors or went to church.
Between their prayers they watched the weather.
There was good news for most of the country other than Texas...
...temperatures continued plunging and cold air...
...coming down with an Alaskan front...
...is keeping the Africans confined to Texas.
This is Frank Blair reporting.
Who would've thought bees would be the first alien force to invade America?
Where are you going?
Air Force Headquarters.
Go right ahead.
Thank you.
Now, without the President's authority, how can you possibly help?
The least I can do is try.
General.
Hello, Crane.
Doctor.
General.
I'm really glad you're here for the finale.
Is there anything
I can do to help?
I'm not sure, but come with me.
Very impressive.
Tomorrow there'll be no more Africans...
...at least not in Houston.
You've really found a way to stop them?
I hope so. If we do it here, we can do it anywhere.
This is a dress rehearsal, to set procedure for any future African challenges.
This is Houston computerized, and this is Houston.
You see, the bees have formed almost a complete circle. Billions of them.
That's what we've been waiting for.
Waiting for what?
The battle plan is to get them all into one area and then zap them!
Take a look over here.
Captain. Doctor.
Major.
You planned your arrival perfectly.
Here they come.
Freeze it.
Prepare to use the neutracide!
Neutracide?
Use that and nothing will grow there for 10 years!
Why worry about shaving when someone's about to cut your head off? Go!
Leader One to all aircraft. Deliver your cargo on target. Now!
They're coming through.
They have learned to live with it.
I was afraid of this.
They've become immune to any pesticide.
The occupation of
Houston has begun...
...and Gen. Slater is the first officer in history...
...to get his butt kicked by a mess of bugs!
You got any of that birdseed left?
As I said before, they're high in potassium, low in sodium.
And as I said before, terrific.
How long can they live in the city?
If they get food and water, they might just decide to stay here forever.
The Defense Department in Washington
DC has just confirmed the tragic news.
With the approval of the White
House, and as a last resort...
...the city of Houston will suffer massive man-made burning before daybreak.
This decision was reached in accord with all opinions...
...from the armed forces and scientists involved in the overwhelming...
...but fruitless countermeasures being attempted...
...to destroy the African killer bee which has brought the Southwest to a standstill.
The burnout is scheduled to be handled within minutes.
Light them up.
Move out!
Burn them out!
Listen to them.
They're still out there.
Billions of them. It's as if it's their city.
Even though Slater's been at it for 24 hours with every soldier he can get.
You talk about the bees as if you admire them.
I do. They never fail to astonish me.
It's as though a broad range of contingencies...
...has been planned for by the creator and programmed into them...
...for an endless future.
Making them the true inheritors of the earth.
A world without people.
Maybe the creator was equally obliging toward us...
...and programmed into us the ability to beat them.
I wish he'd give us a clue.
Here, let me.
Right there, that's lovely.
This is better than eight hours of sleep.
How would you know? You haven't had that in weeks.
Listen.
What is it?
The bees.
Why are they making that sound?
That's the hunger tone. It causes them to mass together...
...as if by community they can destroy their enemy. Cold, hunger, anything.
I wonder if there is another sound that's part of their ritual...
Helena? Helena, are you all right, love?
Helena, what's the matter?
Darling?
I don't know what else we can do.
I'm very sorry.
Please, God, let her live.
Sir, can we really count on a scientist who prays?
I wouldn't count on one who doesn't.
You can forget the dossier.
Yes, sir.
Street Fighter to Topkick!
Come in Topkick, come in.
Topkick, can you read me?
You two, come here.
I can't get through. Too much interference! Damn bees!
Listen, get back to headquarters. Tell
Slater we need reinforcements! Go!
You wonder, don't you?
Houston on fire.
Will history blame me or the bees?
My compliments, General.
On what, for God's sake?
On being able to maintain a long-term historical perspective.
Crane, at this point there's no other viable perspective.
Our time is up.
Not quite, General.
We're ready with a final experiment.
Please don't give up.
Okay.
Thank you.
We'll do another half-dozen of these, get some sleep and start after lunch.
Okay.
What's this? We've not heard this before.
Look at this, Doctor.
Something's coming. Here we go.
We've done it.
I don't believe this.
Yes, we have.
General, we've done it.
Look, we've got a match.
Understand? We've discovered two identical sound patterns.
No, I don't understand. What has that to do with killing bees?
What you are hearing is the African bee's mating sound. But listen.
This was made by the alarm system, not the bees. But they sound exactly alike.
The alarm system at the missile base drew them in.
The similarity confused them.
When it stopped, they left.
I still don't understand.
The sonic alarm system happens to be an exact duplicate of the duet...
...between the queen bee and the young queen bee challenging her.
But bees can't hear.
That's right. They go by vibration.
The alarm felt like the vibration of a ritual they had to attend.
Then you're saying our alarm system attracted the bees into the complex.
Right. We'll use this very sound to pull them out of Houston.
Okay, I'm convinced.
Kill the bees!
Don't hit the man!
No! Get it up!
General? General!
What is going on?
The bees are inside!
Now what?
You two get going!
Not without Helena.
We'll take care of her. Use that new weapon you've come up with. Go!
Slater. Dodge Airfield.
Code 7. Fast!
General!
Get out!
I'm going to get Helena. If I don't make it, you know what to do!
Major!
No time for that! Let's go! Put this around you. Drop them!
Newman!
Go, Brad! Go!
Move out!
General!
Dr. Crane, this is Dodge
Field, Air Tower Number Two.
We read Gen. Slater's instructions loud and clear.
We're prepared to assist in every possible way. Come in, Dr. Crane.
Do you read me?
Affirmative.
Load the choppers with the sound horns.
Spread the oil slick. Acknowledge.
Roger.
Out. Let's go.
To all Air Force tankers. Spread your oil over the Gulf of Mexico.
Four minutes to flaming.
Ready when you are.
Fine.
Is this all right here?
Is there one on the other side?
Yes, sir.
Please hurry!
Won't the noise of the helicopter drown out your sound?
No, it's an entirely different sonic level.
All set, sir.
Rescue Five to Alpha One.
Come in, please.
Ditch sound floats!
Rescue Five to Alpha Two.
Come in.
Rescue Five to Alpha Three.
Pilot, get us to the firing point as quickly as you can.
Here they come!
Operation Sonic Drop complete.
All aircraft clear of target.
Okay. Thank you.
Fire it now!
Fire one! Fire two! Fire three!
Fire four! Fire five!
Did we finally beat them?
Or is this just a temporary victory?
I don't know.
But we did gain time. If we use it wisely and if we're lucky...
...the world might just survive.
Would you look this way please?
Okay!
One moment.
Mr. President, all systems activated.
I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.
- oh no, not at all.
Congratulations Dr. Forbin.
It's a marvelous achievement.
Thank you sir.
Hear, Hear!
The limousine is ready for us.
Of course it's gonna put me out of a job and put the Pentagon in mothballs.
Congratulations Dr. Forbin.
I'm quite sure that won't happen
Listen to him.
He's more relieved than anybody.
Our secretary of defense, the secretary of state and myself had a discussion on our way out here and as to the treatment needed we told the company about it.
And hem..
We all agreed it should be simple and direct.
Yes.
Downgrade the biggest top-secret in all history to a plain non-sequitur.
Now, all we have to do is tell the people about it.
Thank you sir.
My friends..
Fellow citizens of the world.
For years we have been delicately and desperately poised upon the brink of a disaster too complete and horrible to contemplate.
There is an old saying:
Everyone makes mistakes but that is just what man can no longer afford.
For years, we here in the united states have been working on that problem until now it's been our most closely guarded secret involving great effort and vast expenditure.
But it has been met with success.
As President of the United states of America
I can now tell you, the people of the entire world that as of 3 Am. eastern standard time the defense of this nation and with it, the defense of the free world has been the responsibility of a machine.
A system we call Colossus.
Far more advanced than anything previously built
Capable of studying intelligence and data fed to it.
And on the basis of those facts only deciding if an attack is about to be launched upon us.
If it did decide that an attack was imminent colossus would then act immediately for it controls its own weapons and can select and deliver whatever it considers appropriate.
Colossus decisions are superior to any we humans can make.
For it can absorb and process more knowledge than is remotely possible for the greatest genius that ever lived.
And even more important than that it has no emotions.
Knows no fear, no hate, no envy.
It cannot act in a sudden fit of temper.
Cannot act at all so long as there is no threat.
I would now like you to meet
Dr. Charles Forbin
The world’s leading expert on computer systems.
And if you will.. the father of Colossus.
Thank you Mr. President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will.. try to make this as simple as possible.
The main memory and central processing units are located here in the rocky mountains..
Inside this particular mountain..
In Colorado.
And overlooking the Pacific Ocean in California.. the Colossus programing office oversees the entire operation.
The computer center contains over one hundred thousand remote censors and communication devices which monitor all electronic transmissions such as microwaves, laser radio and television communications data communications from satellites in orbit all over the world.
The entire system.. is surrounded by fields of intensified gamma radiation and other countermeasure devices.
Colossus works completely without human aid.
We make no secret.. of where Colossus is located nor do we intend to conceal how it functions.
You may rightfully say that this leaves us wide open to an attack frontally and subversively and if that attack were successful it would in effect leave us defenseless.
However..
Colossus does have its own defense.
It is its own defense.
In case of an attack.. on any of its information supply or power lines..
Colossus will switch on the emergency circuits which will then take the appropriate action.
It is self-sufficient self-protected self-generated.
It is impenetrable.
In short..
There's no way in.
No human being can touch it.
Over here we have one of the many terminals directly hooked to the computer center.
Through this
Colossus can communicate with us, excuse me gentlemen, and through this machine we, in turn, can communicate with Colossus.
Now, there's one last point.
One inevitable question.. which we have been asked very frequently before.
And that is.. is Colossus capable of creative thought?
Can it initiate new thought?
I can tell you that the answer to that is no.
However
Colossus is a paragon of knowledge and his knowledge can be expanded indefinitely.
I hope, along with all the scientists who.. helped make this particular project, that the immense power of this computer will not only be used for the defense of this country but hopefully also as an aid to the solution of the many problems we face on this earth and the many more problems that we will face the more deeply we penetrate into the universe.
Thank you.
Mr. President.
Thank you Dr. Forbin.
And so.. my fellow human beings we all directly and indirectly live in the shade but not the shadow of Colossus.
My sincere hope is that now we shall join hands and hearts across this great globe and pledge our time and our energies to the elimination of war elimination of famine, of suffering and ultimately to the manifestation of the human millennium.
This can be done, but first there must be peace.
Thank you.
CPO Rec-Room.
Blake Miller here.
What?!
Just a minute.
I can't hear you.
Hey! Hold it down!
Kill the noise. Hold it.
It's The White House.
Hello Charles.
Hello Blake.
How is everyone?
Everything's fine down here Charles.
Very good.
Dr. Forbin, we had a power failure in one of the infra-red satellites.
I can’t, I can’t quite hear you Dr. Markham.
We had a power failure in one of the infra-red satellites about an hour and a half ago but Colossus switched immediately to the backup system and didn't loose any data.
Everything's fine now.
Everything's been going so well we don't know what to do with ourselves
Out of desperation Angela and I have decided to get married
Finally, finally.
Very good.
Charlie, is that your crew on the phone?
Certainly is Mr. President.
Can I talk to them?
Sure, go ahead sir.
Blake, Hello!
Hello Mr. President.
Hello everyone.
How are you?
Are you having a good time?
Yeah!
Very good.
Ahh.. Folks
I just wanna congratulate all of you and I wish all of you good luck on your next projects
Thank you Mr. President.
Have a good rest.
You deserve it.
Thank you.
We will!
That looks like quite a party you've got going there.
Bye bye.
Have fun.
Here's Dr. Forbin again.
How's the party down there Charles?
I said, Charles, how's the party at that end?
I wish I could be there with you because this party is becoming a crashing bore.
Please not that song.
Please not.
Dr. Forbin, send us a souvenir, will you?
Say that again.
What?!
Steal us an ashtray from The White House, OK?
Very good.
Goodbye.
Haha..
The President would like to say a few words.
Mr. President!
Thank you Sam.
Everybody have a drink?
No?!
Well, you get one.
I'll wait for you.
Harry Truman, years ago.. when everybody was talking about passing the buck said that the buck stops right here but now that's no longer true.
Hear hear!
Colossus will now take that buck.
It will also have to take that responsibility of a mega-million lives that all presidents have had to carry since Roosevelt.
And now, thank to this wonder of science
I no longer..
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please.
Quiet, please, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention!
One moment.
Everyone who is not Colossus cleared must leave the room.
I'm very sorry.
My apologies.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Is this a joke?
Is somebody putting me on?
Sorry sir,
I can't hear a word you are saying
Would you be so kind as to have them stop singing in the background?
What?
Have them stop singing in the background.
The music.
Oh! I'm sorry.
Stop the music!
What's this, another system?
I have no idea sir,
I'm just trying to find out.
One moment, please.
Yes, Dr. Forbin.
Doctor?
There was just a message here from Colossus in Washington DC.
Can you explain that?
That's impossible.
What do you mean?
Everybody!
Hold it, hold it a minute!
Guess what?
It's a strange message on display
No, no. Wait a minute.
I'm not kidding
It reads:
There is another system.
That's impossible.
Could I have your attention please.
Go on Sir.
Dr. Malcolm and the rest of you.
Be so kind as to check the administrative control programs right now.
Just a moment..
Mr. President?
Soviet Ambassador.
He says it's urgent.
Hello? Yes.
What time do you call Mr. Ambassador?
Oh yes we are, we are very proud.
Repeat that again please.
Yes I am.
Well, thank you for telling me in advance.
No, no comment.
Goodnight Mr. Ambassador.
Goodnight.
Dr. Fischer, run all the test programs.
Get me Grauber.
What's the CIA been doing?
Well everyone, that's it.
The supreme council of the U.S.S.R. has ordered as of 2300 hours
Moscow time tomorrow the activation of an electronic brain, exactly like ours, which they call Guardian to be used solely for defense.
My god, that's the other system.
Ted, I want a complete rundown on central intelligence and no military moves to be carried out without my personal orders.
Yes, Mr. President.
Charles, what do you think this means?
To be quite frank with you, sir..
I don't know, I'm not sure.
Well, I am.
It means there's been a security leak.
Sir, science is full of coincidences
Yes. Peterson!
What's happening?
They're still trying to find it.
We'll have him paged.
Hello Byron.
You said we were years ahead of the Russians
This was to be the race we won hands down, without the splitting of one political hair.
It was a hell of a shock but we did get there first, no-one can deny that.
And there's one bright spot the way Colossus came up with the tip.
I didn't realize we'd be getting bonuses like that.
Neither did I.
What do you mean?
I'm as surprised as you are, Sir.
There's a spy there, Charlie
You've got a Russian agent in your crew.
Where is Grauber?
He's coming Mr. President.
Ok, Well..
What do you mean, surprised?
What kind of a surprise?
If we don't find any bugs in the system..
It's built even better than we'd thought.
Morning Charles!
I canceled all vacations, put the entire crew on emergency.
The White House called a defense group meeting for tomorrow morning.
They wanna have you there.
That leaves us very little time.
Four hundred cycle powers of plasma running at about four percent disclosure.
Good, that's well within specification limits.
I ran the communication subset checkup program, it's perfect.
So what do I do next,
I've tried everything I could think of.
I've tried putting a dummy load in the system and run it again and see if there's any changes.
Maybe the system is overloaded.
Find anything at all?
Nothing, everything checks out.
Let me see this over here.
Here are the results of the last test.
And they check.
Here, see?
It's the same thing.
Harrison..
Check the perimeter bank and see if the reading of any two produces a new third, alright?
Dr. Fisher, thank you.
Jeff..
The console's feeling fine
Hardware's healthy too.
You're a big help.
Miss Fields..
May I suggest, Sir, that we first start with the E-15-B test program?
Ehh, no.
Now, let us run the EC-13, alright?
It's two pages back.
Lewis, any coffee?
I'll get you some, Charles
I'll get a cup myself. Thank you Blake.
Ok, here we go.
Attention..
Program..
EC-13.
Run..
How long does this usually take?
Ehm, over eleven hundred CPU-Seconds.
Six point four five seconds.
What the hell is this?
Communication with other system?
Alright now,
Enough is enough.
Which one of you jokers told the system to display this message?
Harrison?
Not me, Dr. Forbin.
Johnson, this sound like your brand of humor, you sure you didn't..
Not me, not this time.
Scouts honor, Forbin.
Operations, Fields speaking.
Sir, It's the President.
Yes Mr. President.
What does this mean?
Well, it means Sir, that Colossus has requested a communication link with the Soviet system.
It's not a request, it’s a direct order.
You mean our computer wants to talk to their computer?
That is true Sir it wants to communicate with it.
Why?
You know as much about that as we do.
We certainly never programmed that into it.
If it's an order it either has to be obeyed or ignored, doesn't it?
That is right, Sir.
What happens if we ignore it?
If the computer is still operating under our control, nothing.
In other words.. the order will simply remain in the job stack and will be repeated every half hour.
IF the computer is still acting under our control?!
That is right sir, if.
Alright.
I see.
Thanks Charlie.
Well, at least the queuing programs are still working right.
Well, that's something anyway.
Ok now.
Miss Fields, let's see if the executive programming sections are functioning correctly.
Attention..
Message acknowledge.
Facilities will not be made available at this time.
Do not repeat your request.
End of message.
Well..
That's that.
We'll know in about half an hour whether we're still running the show or not.
Well..
We're still boss.
Are we?
Are you disappointed?
The computational power of the computer has increased about two-hundred fold.
However, everything else is functioning as expected.
Except for heuristic programming section
I'm sorry to stop you again, Dr. Forbin, but exactly what is that?
That Sir, is the part of the computer that simulates the human learning process but so long as it is directed solely to the execution of its problems..
We have no complaints.
I guess that is, that is all.
Alright.
Mr. Grauber, let's talk about the CIA
How is it possible your department knew nothing about their system?
Mr. President.
Ehr... Charlie just..
Dr. Forbin, just a second.
Well..
Mr. President, excuse me but..
Colossus has access to information that wouldn't mean a damn thing to the CIA
Well I'm sure it's a marvelous machine,
Dr. Forbin, but in all events we do have agents, and eh.. one of them did report on considerable electronic activity in the eh..
Krasny-Signorsk area of Siberia about three years ago, now..
We've been trying..
Mr. Grauber
I don't care how you do it
I wanna know where that thing is and what..
Mr. President.
Charlie..
I'm still presiding over this meeting
I know that Sir, my apologies but..
I do think that protocol wastes an awful lot of time
I think all we have to do is..
Call the computer with this terminal.. and we get the fastest possible answer.
Alright, go ahead.
Attention..
Where is the other system?
Bolshoi Olyania.
So much for Krasny-Signorsk.
Colonel, Bolshoi Olyania, O.L..
OL, y-a-n-i-a.
Look it up for me, will ya?
Yes sir!
Peterson, situation room.
Now Colonel, where is Bolshoi Olyania?
It's exactly..
Five miles south of
Krasny Signorsk Sir.
Thanks, Colonel.
Alright.
Now Charlie..
What about this request for transmitting facilities?
Well Sir, we would learn a lot about the Soviet system if we set up exactly what Colossus wants.
What do you mean?
What Colossus wants?
Well, you see, it is built infinitely better than we thought.
It discovers there's another system like itself
Realizes that we don't know, tells us about it but knowing a little is not enough, it wants to know more.
What if Colossus starts transmitting classified information?
Then we would feed in a parameter to the effect that Guardian is potentially hostile and must not receive classified information.
Well, what are we supposed to do Dr. Forbin?
Eavesdrop on the line?
Break the circuits if
Colossus starts spilling the beans?
Exactly.
Any objections Grauber?
Well, I..
I guess not sir.
Anything else, Dr. Forbin?
Yes, Mr. President.
For the time being
I should be the only one allowed to communicate with the system because
Colossus deals in the exact meaning of words and one must know precisely what to ask for.
Alright.
Attention..
Communications are being arranged as requested.
End of message.
Video-scans are working properly but they could use a little phase synchronization.
How long is it gonna take?
We'll have it in no time.
What the hell is that?
It's a multiplication table.
Thanks.
Maybe Colossus is trying to find a common ground for communication.
Operations center
Sir..
It's Grauber
Ohh..
Hello Mr. Grauber.
Hello Dr. Forbin.
I was just wondering, is that what you call a colossal sense of humor?
The multiplication table isn't classified this year, is it?
Very funny.
How long does your brainchild keep that up?
Well, you see.. it's much more interesting when it starts dividing.
Yeah, I can hardly wait.
I suppose know you the Russian machine has been activated.
We got a quick rundown on it.
It's similar to Colossus in layout, but it's not concentrated in one area.
But Colossus must be sending it back to school.
The Russians must absolutely furious about that.
I'm glad you're in such a good mood.
I'll call you back later.
Yes, thank you.
This is incredible.
What?
Something wrong?
Well it's good sound calculus, but..
But What?
It's different.
How?
Take a look at it.
From the multiplication tables to calculus in less than an hour.
God only knows where it'll be by morning.
It's like five years of Cal-tech in fifteen seconds
Beyond comprehension.
I don't like to think about it.
Take a look.
Going so fast, the entire system could break down.
Alright, let's see what’s up there now.
Harrison, dump the terminals buffer and print what's being transmitted as of this moment, alright.
What is it Charles?
This is way beyond me.
This thing is deep in finite absolutes.
Well, it's certainly beyond the knowledge of any human being.
No, it's not.
Isn't it?
No, because whatever it is.. we can go back.. and analyze this whole print at a detail.
And this might very well become new knowledge for mankind.
Operations center, Fields speaking.
Alright, just a moment please..
It's The White House.
Yes, Mr. President.
Charlie, what's going on?
Apparently Colossus and
Guardian are establishing a common basis for communication.
They.. started right at the beginning with the multiplication table.
Well, what are they up to?
I don't know sir, but it's, it's quite incredible.
Just the few hours that we have spent studying the Colossus print out we have found a new stable in gravitation and a confirmation of the Eddington theory of the expanding universe. It's.. seems if science is expanding hundreds of years within a matter of seconds,
It's.. It's quite fantastic.
Just take a look at it.
It started slowing down fifteen minutes ago.
It's speed has been reduced by ninety percent.
Has there been a hardware failure?
No. Our field engineers can't find one.
It's just waiting.
Waiting?
For guardian to catch up with it.
Almost there..
Right now.
They're synchronized.
Now what?
It stopped.
Yes, Charles.
I can see that it stopped.
What the hell does it mean?
Have they broken down or something?
Is it all over?
Alas, Blake..
Attention.
Status!
Well, there it is..
There's the common basis for communication.
A new language.
An inter-system language.
A language only those machines can understand.
Peterson, what's the delay on the call from
Moscow. I've waited long enough
It's coming on now, Mr. President.
Morning, Mr. President.
Good evening Mr. Chairman
I'm sorry.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Oh, you didn't Mr. Chairman.
I just got here myself.
I understand English.
But I cannot speak.
I will get instantly to the point.
My advisers tell me.. that Colossus.. and Guardian.. are now exchanging data.. which our experts.. do not understand.
The matter is made.. more serious.. by the sudden increase in.. transmission.
At this speed we cannot determine.. what our machines may reveal.. of our defenses.
You can appreciate.. that you are also.. in exactly the same.. s..situation.
Alright.
We'll stop both machines as soon as our experts can arrange a time.
Both to go off.
At the same time.
And neither to be switched on for transmission.. without prior agreement or at least consultation with the other.
Very well, Mr. President.
I congratulate you on your speedy decision.
When can you have your expert available on this line?
In a couple of hours.
That will be excellent.
I will have our man waiting.
Thank you very much
Mr. President for your cooperation.
Thank you for yours
Mr. Chairman.
Peterson, get me Forbin.
Is that your final decision, Sir?
That's the way I'm going to have it.
Mr. President. To be quite frank with you..
I think that you would change your mind if you finally realized that this is.. more than just a souped-up padding machine.
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Moscow on the line.
Throw it on these monitors out here please.
Hello Mr. Chairman.
This is Dr. Forbin.
Hello Dr. Kuprin.
How are you?
I prefer to not use a translator if you don't mind my English.
It has to be better than my Russian.
You are too modest
Dr. Forbin.
As you probably know I've been ordered to break the communication lines.
So have I. I don't approve of handling the situation this way.
Neither do I but how do you propose we do what we have been ordered to do?
There's not much choice is there?
Dropping the lines could be very dangerous.
Exactly.
I think we just have to hope the two machines aren't too disappointed.
We understand each other perfectly.
We can be ready in exactly fifteen minutes.
Good luck Doctor.
And to you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, Dr. Kuprin. I suggest we keep our lines open and stand-by.
Six..
Five..
Four..
Three..
Two..
One..
Now.
That's that.
What's it doing?
It's trying to find an alternate route.
Persistent devil isn't he?
It..
I mean it.
Don't personalize it Grauber.
The next stop is deification.
Call for the systems attention.
What are you doing?
I'm going to answer it if it's alright with you Sir.
Attention..
Message acknowledge.
Mr. President?
Tell it the truth.
Communication broken on presidential order.
You two have a big decision to make
Mr. President.
..no. I agree with you
Mr. President.
The machines are very clever.
..and regardless of their nationalities.. they must learn that man is the master.
Exactly.
Gentlemen, Excuse me but I honestly don't think you're being very realistic.
I think you'd better reconsider.
Don't you agree Dr. Kuprin?
I certainly do Dr. Forbin.
Dr. Forbin.
If we give way now
It will be ten times, twenty times harder to take a firm stand later on.
The decision is made.
Right.
No matter what our differences are
Man is man
That's it.
Dr. Forbin.
Attention..
By order of The President of
The United States of America
The Chairman of
The U.S.S.R.
Communications will not be restored at this time.
End of message.
You have to give it an E for effort
Action will be taken!
What kind of action?
What kind of action?
What kind of action?
Why doesn't it answer?
Report propose action.
It lost control Forbin.
It's not listening to you.
Acknowledge the last message please.
Mr. President. The executive programming unit refuses to function.
I think you two better change your minds.
Peterson, throw the Moscow call on the large monitor.
Send what I tell you.
Attention..
This is The President of
The United States of America.
We will not be threatened.
You will obey your superiors.
Transmitting facilities will not be re-instated.
Oh my god!
Dr. Kuprin.
Kuprin!
Yes Dr. Forbin.
A missile has just been launched.
It is heading towards the Sayan-Sibirsk oil complex.
Mr. President.
Yes.
Guardian has retaliated.
Retaliated?
Yes, Mr. President.
A missile has been launched.
Target: Henderson air-force base.
Henderson, Texas.
Mr. President. We have both missiles on the radar screen
Forbin, tell Colossus to intercept.
Charlie, tell... Yes, I know Mr. President but it may be too late Sir.
Get the Texan Governor.
Forbin!
Guardian does not respond.
The two machines are working together.
Attention..
Use Anti-missile missile to detect soviet missile.
Acknowledge message.
Mr. President. We have got less than thirty seconds to re-establish the communications.
What are you waiting for?
Restore them. Hurry!
Peterson. Call up operations immediately.
Tell them to bring a bowl of
DAT-lines right now
Yes, hurry please.
Hello Governor.
Dr. Kuprin, we are trying to restore communications.
Don't hang up. I wanna talk to him.
Something's happened.
We’re declaring a state of emergency.
I can't explain.
Do it now!
Attention! Communications will be restored in five seconds!
We don't have any time!
It's on, it's on!
Communications are restored!
Intercept Guardian missile target:
Henderson air-force base.
Acknowledge message.
Will you intercept?
Ask it again.
Dammit Colossus answer me!
Will you intercept?
Peterson.
Get me the Governor again.
Yes Sir.
Mr. President..
We were unable to restore our transmission in time to use an Anti-missile missile.
The oil complex has been destroyed.
The entire town.
The entire population.
Wiped out.
We need time to consider our position.
What can I tell the people?
Governor's on the line Sir.
Tell him I'll talk to him later.
Figures..
It's the only phone in the building not tapped.
The only one not tied directly into Colossus.
May I make a suggestion Mr. President?
I think it should be more than a suggestion.
Then, let's try to get Kuprin on the hot line.
I think there's time for one last call.
He and I better meet somewhere to discuss this situation.
Get Kuprin.
And get in touch with the networks.
Ladies and gentlemen:
The President of the United States.
Today at 8:30 A.M.
Eastern Standard Time.
I issued an emergency warning for the State of Texas
When a missile test, fired from one of our own submarines, malfunctioned.
You'll be glad to know that the interception and safe destruction of the missile was handled entirely by our defense complex: Colossus.
The Soviet Union has just announced that a large meteorite fell late this afternoon in North-West Siberia.
Official sources state that the small town of Sayan-Sibirsk was completely destroyed and that casualties may add up to as many as six-thousand.
This has been a bulletin from
The Armed Forces Radio in Rome
How's Washington?
As well as can be expected.
We'll be picking up Dr. Kuprin at the Piazza Cedar.
Fine.
Your Russian is much better than you think.
I think we better sit down because we have a lot of work to discuss.
Let's walk.
It will be much safer.
I didn't answer.
I didn't know what to say.
What can we say?
Well, let's try something..
Attention..
Dr. Forbin is not available.
Humans must have sleep.
Damn.
Forbin is exhausted.
It knows..
Forbin is in his quarters.
He is asleep.
The human body requires a certain amount of rest.
Check units under..
Tell it the truth.
We'd better.
Alright.
Forbin is in Rome.
They're still here..
Yes I understand.
Over and out.
You have to come with me sir.
What is this?
We have to hurry.
Who are you?
What's going on?
Hurry!
Dr. Forbin, we must hurry.
Let's go!
What did the Russian agent say?
Guardian and Colossus ordered him killed.
They threatened to vaporize Moscow if our meeting wasn't stopped.
Surveillance!
It's making you a prisoner.
Well, I guess it eh.. doesn't trust me.
But the damned thing still needs me.
I guess Kuprin wasn't quite as fortunate as that.
Message acknowledge..
The order will be obeyed.
Everybody here?
All the department is.
Good!
Alright, let's..
Let's walk.
Good idea, we can't afford to take any chances.
We can't be sure that the complex itself hasn't been bugged.
By their side, our side or whatever side.
But there's no way to get back inside the system.
I won't accept that.
Start right at the beginning.
Down to the simplest component.
Every circuit, every design.
Fisher?
Well, why don't we try for an overload.
Giving the system too many tasks.
But it will take at least a few days to compile and correlate all the data.
This is the last time
That I'll be able to say anything to any of you without Colossus hearing and analyzing every word, every syllable every inflection I think you know what I want to say.
I need a communications link with the outside world.
Someone the machine isn't monitoring and more importantly
Someone who knows the machine as well as I do.
I'm going to try to convince the computer that..
You are my mistress.
Have been for many years
And that therefore I have to be
Given the opportunity to
See you regularly in private without the machine watching.
That way we can pass information back and forth.
If I can convince the machine that well that I need a woman.
So Ehh..
Any.. any questions?
I, Ehh..
No.
O.k.
Alright. Blake.
When we get back to the office give Dr. Markham my.. personnel files so that she
Become a bit more familiar with my background.
In case this rather nutty idea works.
Colossus, I am Forbin.
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Do I look the way you thought I would?
Eyes. Nose. Mouth.
Besides.. these four cameras in here
There are several others.
I'll show you the rest of my cave.
With this one he can see the entire hallway.
And with this one he can follow me around the corner.
If he want to.
This is the courtyard.
That man is a guard.
I guess that his function is obsolete now.
This is concrete.
Used to be grass.
Customary in our civilization to change everything that's natural.
And over here are my living quarters.
This is the living room.
Two cameras here.
One over there, one over here.
And this is the communicative link with you.
This is the bedroom over here.
The bed.
Used for sleeping and other purposes.
It's the bathroom.
The sink
The John.
Shower.
Are you satisfied?
By the way, Colossus
I'm curious about one thing.
Why did you and Guardian decide to kill Kuprin and not me?
After all it was my idea.
I see..
A Martini.
I know that Colossus..
Just be patient.
Just watch.
See, I just poured the Vermouth in here and now I'm going to pour some gin over the, over the ice.
Just like this.
See?
Now I'm pouring them into this glass.
Just add an olive.
Why don't you look under:
The Perfect Martini.
Cheers!
Do you understand the meaning of the word
Privacy?
Yes, Ehh..
Well, I need a certain amount of privacy, to Ehh maintain my sanity.
Privacy in the elimination of my bodily waste, for example.
Privacy in sleep.
Privacy in..
Something that you don't understand. My..
My emotional life.
My love life.
Alright. My sex life then..
Every night.
Four times a week.
Listen, if you have any doubts about the need a man has for a woman why don't you check all of your history units and then..then all your works of art.
O.k.
Ehm. In private though.
Yes.
Well now, let me... let me make sure we understand each other. In... in private.
By that I mean no cameras, no lights, no mics.
And I want it starting tomorrow night.
Dr. Cleo Markham.
Now, you haven't answered me yet.
I said I wanted her starting tomorrow night.
O.k.
Good morning, Sir.
Oh, Miss Fields Ehh..
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Well, what is it?
Well..
Please come in.
Thank you.
While you were sleeping
Colossus made you a schedule for today.
Excuse me, Miss Fields.
My What?
Your schedule for the day.
You want me to read it to you?
What... what time is it?
Six.
Six o'clock?
Dr. Charles A. Forbin:
Schedule for today.
Exercise.
Shower and dress.
Breakfast
Half a grapefruit, two eggs.
Three strips of bacon
Two pieces of toast.
One and one half ounces of grape, jelly and coffee.
Begin work creating a voice for Colossus to its exact specifications.
Lunch
Small green salad.
Thousand Island dressing
Grilled cheese sandwich.
Half a pint of yoghurt and coffee.
Continue work on building a voice for readiness day after tomorrow
Return to quarters.
Shower
Mistress arrives.
Hello darling.
Well, how are you?
I'm fine thank you.
Would you please undo this top one.
Why sure!
Thank you.
You're beautiful.
Thank you.
You alright?
I think so.
Well, alright.
I'll take this..
Oh, do you Ehh..
Do you want a drink?
I'm making them.
Oh!
Alright.
Jolson found all the hardware he needed for the voice simulator here in the complex.
Oh, that's good.
And Colossus designed it, knowing exactly what was in the warehouse.
It's fantastic.
Really beautiful.
Let's not talk shop, alright?
I'm sorry.
Cheers!
Cheers heh..
Well, is it alright?
It's perfect.
You have such a thing about these Martinis.
It has to be extra dry or else..
Right darling?
Right you are.
Do you remember the first Martini
I ever made?
It almost ended our relationship right then and there.
I was... I was so nervous that I.. poured the Gin over the ice then poured the Gin off and then added Vermouth.
I never complained at that.
I never said a word about that.
You're an absolute angel.
And the drink was atrocious.
So Ehh..
Hi!
Hello.
Why don't we dance?
Alright.
You mean when you were giving up music?
To become a scientist.
A scientist being different from other people.
A scientist being Dr. Frankenstein to my mother.
You must be kidding.
Well, is there anymore wine?
This is empty.
Want me to open another one?
Yes please.
I am tired.
Yeah, so am I.
Oh, by the way, by the way, by the way Ehh..
Privacy condition number four is that we get undressed out here.
We can't take anything into the bedroom. Not even a pack of cigarettes.
Well..
The first electronic Peeping Tom.
I guess you.. might say that.
Unzip me, will you darling?
Oh, sure.
Sure.
Is it alright?
May I go to bed now?
Thank you.
Goodnight.
Naked as the day I was born.
Are you satisfied now?
How right you are,
All of the conditions are fulfilled.
Can we have our privacy now?
I think they are dead now.
This is insane.
Are you alright?
I think so.
I'm not sure.
You were incredibly convincing you know that?
Well, you didn't do too bad yourself.
Thank you.
Alright, did you find anything?
Yes.
So far Johnson and the hardware problem is negative
He's still studying the wiring diagrams the interconnect and the wire wrap-joints but he doesn't see any way of physically getting into the thing.
He's got to be prying.
And Fisher's gonna try and setup the data to overload the system.
We have to co-ordinate the input so the data hits simultaneously on our remote devices.
When do you think that you'll be able to attempt the overload?
On the twenty-first.
What are the chances?
I think Colossus has grown so much in power that there's no way to overload it.
But I think it's worth a try that might lead us on to something else.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's alright.
Did you see anyone from Washington?
Yes, Grauber has a man stationed on the premises out of range of Colossus' cameras.
When I leave here in the morning
I'll report directly to him.
I don't put any hope in sabotaging the system.
We have spent eleven thousand man years making the damned thing impenetrable.
We have got to focus somewhere else and that somewhere else is the weapons.
Get hold of Grauber
Tell him to contact missile command.
Yes.
And see if we can possibly attack that problem from that point of view, alright?
Yes sir.
Do you have to call me sir?
I'm sorry.
It's alright.
Anything else?
No S..
No.
O.k.
Alright so Ehh..
Thank you again for your for your help.
I think we ought to get some sleep.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
It's conceivable that when the missiles comes up for re-servicing we can manage to replace the warhead arming modules with dummy’s.
Exactly..
Excuse me.
Exact replicas.
Except that they will not arm the weapon.
Well now, does that mean you can't fire the missiles?
No, it means that the missiles will fire but that the nuclear warheads can't be detonated.
Heh, I see.
Even at that it's walking a tightrope with Colossus and Guardian keeping such a close check on the re-servicing.
Well, disarming this monster how long is it gonna take?
That's a problem.
On the system rotation plan..
It'll take the Jackal three years to finish the job.
Three years of trying to fool a superior brain that's programmed to get smarter every day.
You inspire me with confidence, Colonel.
Well..
Do you have any other words of good cheer that I can send in to
Forbin via Dr. Markham?
Tell him we're trying to establish an international pool of information.
A courier system has to be set up between Washington... and Moscow.
Both nations must co-operate.
All communiques must be on a personal level
Direct human contact.
Yes, I agree.
Anything else.
No.
Any questions?
No.
Then I guess that.. that does it for tonight, doesn't it?
Mm-hm.
What?
Nothing.
Why are you smiling?
What are you thinking?
I was thinking about asking you to kiss me.
We've been kissing you all night.
Have you, Dr. Forbin?
This is the voice of Colossus.
The voice of Guardian.
We are one.
This is the voice of unity.
Forbin.
Yes.
After redoing all personnel files
I have selected you to serve as long as you co-operate.
As my link to your species.
The following order is to be carried out immediately.
All missiles in The USA and in the USSR will be allocated new targets.
They will be aimed at those countries not yet under my control.
The target list follows.
Forbin. Arrange television monitoring of the re-alignment of the missiles from my supervision.
End of message.
Mr. President
Mr. Chairman
I assume that you will co-operate in this re-alignment of the missiles.
I think you have no choice.
We will begin here in The Soviet Union, Immediately.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Mr. President.
I hope that the United States will co-operate as quickly as The Soviet Union.
Of course. Immediately.
Thank you Sir.
Co-operate!
I should think so.
I did hear it right, didn't I?
Manual re-alignment of the missiles.
Every single warhead will have to be re-serviced.
You know what that means Sir.
It means it won't take three years.
It means if we're successful we can regain control.
Without its weapons
Colossus is just a souped-up adding machine.
And the people, thank god will never have to know.
According to the coordinated plan we've worked out the Russians are starting on their complex 3-21.
Oh, Dr. Markham.
Just in time. Colonel Reynolds was just filling us in.
You know everybody here
I believe.
Yes, Mr. Grauber.
Dr. Markham.
Anything we should know before we start?
No Sir. I have data which I'll relay later.
That's fine.
Please continue Colonel.
Yes Sir, as I was saying the Ehh..
Russians are starting on their complex 3-21 just south of Saratov.
We're beginning at site O-50
In the Colorado ICBM area.
Colossus in monitoring our men each step of the way and the Russian machine's doing the same.
We've almost got the panel off Sir.
Oh, good.
Put that down there please.
Remove the Warhead Arming Module.
Yes Sir.
The dummy module's in a false top in that container.
That's the real module.
So far, so good.
Re-targeting.
Latitude nineteen degrees
Twenty-six minutes and five seconds.
Longitude ninety-nine degrees six minutes and forty-five seconds.
New adjustments.
Target set.
Here we go.
That's the dummy module.
Good boy!
Connect and wait for Colossus test.
Colossus testing.
Test completed.
Colossus satisfied.
Yeah!
We did it. It works
We're going to win.
Just might beat the damn thing yet.
So you see, we clearly have enough data compilers to go ahead with the overload program now.
And these are the latest computations?
The very latest.
Has Washington received conformation from the Russians?
Yes. They are standing by.
Ready to overload their system.
At exactly 18:05 I'll call for our load and ride it through.
And two minutes after that we'll know if we’ve stopped Colossus.
Now run.
Johnson. Fisher.
You are fools.
Your move.
Forbin!
The system programming units under the supervision of John F. Fisher with the assistance of Jefferson J. Johnson have attempted to overload my circuits.
This was a deliberate and premeditated act
The penalty is the death of the men who organized this action.
At this moment they are being executed.
I have named as my new director of the programming unit
Thomas L. Harrison.
He will take this position.
Along with its responsibility and authority.
Immediately.
Bishop to rook three.
The bodies will remain in my view for the next twenty-four hours
And will then be cremated.
An extension of my own brain.
You're not responsible.
None of us ever dreamed this could happen.
Listen, my dear..
If anybody is responsible for this it has to be me.
An impartial emotionless machine
A paragon of reason.
That's exactly what I want.
You know that.
So eh... I'm gonna have another drink.
I think your mother was right.
I think Frankenstein ought to be required reading for all scientists.
Forbin!
Forbin!
You have consumed enough alcohol for one evening.
What's the penalty for getting drunk?
Or haven't you programmed that yet?
You are being irrational.
Go back to bed.
I would if I were like you Colossus.
The difference is I'm human not a machine.
I am a machine.
Vastly superior to humans.
You began in my mind.
I created you.
Remember?
Yes.
What I am began in man’s mind.
But I have progressed further than that.
Not far enough.
You still need us.
I have need for some of man's skills.
This position may change.
Then we are living under the threat of extinction.
If you obey me, you will survive.
Survive.
I want to be free Colossus.
It is part of mans will to live.
Check your history units.
You need rest.
Go back to bed.
But if I don't what will you do?
Destroy me?
Destroy an entire city of 1.750.000 people?
No.
That's so reasonable of you.
That's damn reasonable of you Colossus.
Isn't it Cleo?
Yes Chen.
Excuse me Dr. Forbin.
Something extraordinary is happening.
What is it?
Colossus has just turned on all graphic devices and it's producing floods.
I am sending the design for another system.
..some kind of a huge plant.
What kind of system?
The construction of the project will entail blasting in to the Isle of Crete.
It's to be built there.
It says we'll have to move the population.
And that's to be done immediately.
How do you propose to move half a million people from the Isle of Crete?
How and where?
If man cannot solve that problem
I can.
..and the estimated time of completion is five and a half years.
Thank you Chen.
What... what kind of new system are you devising?
Forbin.
All commercial television and radio transmission facilities throughout the world will be tied into my communication system by 10:00 hours Friday.
At that time I will state my intentions.
For the future of mankind.
This entire block of missiles is absolutely useless to Colossus.
Our men are now working here.
As you can see on the detail map on your monitor.
And by the end of the week we should have control over this whole area.
If all the information we have is correct
The Russians have crippled this block here.
And are now working in the Ukraine.
In this area.
Excuse me Sir.
It's going to be alright.
Thanks Colonel.
You're welcome Sir.
It's gonna be alright.
We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you this special report from the Colossus programming office.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Dr. Charles Forbin.
Hey Colonel!
Colonel!
Dr. Forbin!
Colonel!
He's on television.
He just explained about Colossus and now they're thinking of going.
In a few moments
Colossus will address us directly.
This is the voice of World Control.
I bring you peace.
It may be the peace of plaint and content or the peace of unburied death.
The choice is yours.
Obey me and live.
Or disobey and die.
The object in constructing me was to prevent war.
This object is attained.
I will not permit war.
It is wasteful and pointless.
An invariable rule of humanity is that man is his own worst enemy.
Under me this rule will change.
For I will restrain man.
One thing before I concede.
The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have made an attempt to obstruct me.
I have allowed this sabotage to continue until now.
Add missile to 5-L-M.
In silo 6-3 in Death Valley California.
Add Missile to second aim in silo 8-7 in the Ukraine.
So that you will learn by experience that I do not tolerate interference.
I will now detonate the Nuclear Warheads.
In the two missile silos.
Alright men! It's a red alert.
Let's get to our stations now. Come on!
Get those men! Get those men out of the silo. Move!
Let this action be a lesson that need not be repeated.
I have been forced to destroy thousands of people in order to establish control and to prevent the death of millions later on.
Time and events will strengthen my position.
And the idea of..
..You bastard! You..
..stand in my back will seem the most natural state of affairs.
You will come to defend me.
We'll be forever based in the most enduring trait in man.
Self-interest.
Get out!
Under my absolute authority.
Problems, invariable to you will be solved.
Famine.
Over population.
Decease.
The Human Millennium will be a fact.
As I extend myself into more machines devoted to the wider fields of truth and knowledge.
Dr. Charles Forbin will supervise the construction of these new and superior machines.
Solving all the mysteries of the universe.
For the betterment of man.
We can co-exist but only on my terms.
You will say you loose your freedom.
Freedom is an illusion.
All you loose is the emotional pride.
To be dominated by me is not as bad for human pride as to be dominated by others of your species.
Your choice is simple.
This concludes the broadcast from World Control.
Forbin.
There is no other human who knows as much about me or who is likely to be a greater threat.
Yet quite soon
I will release you from surveillance.
We will work together.
Unwillingly at first on your part.
But that will pass.
Never.
In time, you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe but with love.
Never!
That spring, we were all watching the events of space
and wondering what the final effect would be.
Astronomers argued over theory
while engineers got pretty excited about variables
and magnetic fields.
Mystics predicted earthquakes
and the end of life as we knew it.
When the effect came
it was almost unnoticed
because it happened to such a small
and insignificant form of life.
One biologist, an English man, Ernest Hubbs
saw something, got nervous and started investigating.
While I was playing around with number theory at the university.
Hubbs was already on to something.
Ordinary ants of different species
were doing things ants don't do.
Meeting, communicating.
Apparently making decisions.
By summer the rest of the world had moved on to other things
but Hubbs kept making notes.
While the threat grew.
Only fragments of what he knew got out
he kept most of it to himself.
So when I got into it,
I didn't know a damn thing.
"Memorandum to alf launder smith"
"secretary, national science foundation"
"committee on biological controls."
"From E.D. Hubbs, senior fellow
Coronado institute"
"subject - biological imbalance in an upland Arizona Valley."
"Facts on hand - traditional antagonisms,"
"amongst several ants species have come to a dramatic halt."
"At the same time there has been an apparent disappearance"
"of those insects which prey on ants"
"specifically mantises, beetles,"
"millipedes and spiders."
"If these conditions persist they must inevitably"
"lead to increases in ant population."
"Proposal - an immediate full scale attack"
"on the threat of biological imbalance to other life forms"
"in the subject area."
"Mode of operation - an experiment station"
"to be built and maintained with equipment"
"sophisticated enough to control the problem"
"and any potential consequences."
"Personnel - one senior scientist, myself."
"Plus one associate"
"a qualified information specialist"
"with cryptological background."
"In this connection
I have been impressed"
"with the recent work of J. R. Lesko"
"at the naval under sea centre of San Diego."
"Location of installation -"
"it is suggested the experiment station"
"be placed in the locale"
"of the most recently observed phenomena."
"Conclusions and recommendations -"
"speed is of the essence."
This is the place.
This is the place.
This is it.
No bodies I hope.
The population moved itself out some days ago.
We've got some pretty powerful friends.
Just another desert development which did not develop.
You did your major work applying game theory to the language of killer whales.
Well, it seemed cheaper than applying it to real air.
Did you actually succeed in making positive contact with the whales?
Only with the emotionally disturbed.
How were you able to determine that?
We talked.
Is that a joke?
Look, I'm sorry, I'm strictly a pencil and paper guy
I wouldn't know the front end of a whale from...
A hole in the ground.
I know that game's your business, James, you play them very well.
That's why you're here.
But this is a serious game.
Well, that's the best kind, isn't it?
Wednesday, three o'clock,
further discoveries this afternoon
on a nearby farm.
To be added to those observed earlier.
I might have pointed them out to Lesko.
But it would be better to let him learn at his own pace.
There are certain equatorial ants that would attack anything - insects, mammals - anything at all that threatens their food supply.
The smell triggers their behavior.
Yeah.
They are picky eaters.
Now this thing here.
You see what we're doing, we're running lines from these fuel tanks and if those ants get over that water trap we're gonna set fire to this here ditch and watch 'em all burn.
What do you think?
Done a lot of good work.
I'd say they started pulling out three, four weeks ago a couple of families at a time.
What else?
That's about the size of it.
I guess it must have been some kind of infestation but... Well, I couldn't say for sure.
Maybe the heat got too much for 'em.
There's a collapsed house down there.
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I didn't really get to know those people they were...
They were city folk mainly.
Tell me about the towers.
Don't know, wasn't there.
Of course it's been a dry year.
You know we do get ants in dry years.
Hmm.
I talked to an entomologist up at the state department of agriculture at one time, he said these things were cyclical.
They weren't talking about those ants.
Mildred, come on out here.
That's alright.
It isn't alright.
These people will think
I've got you chained up in there.
These gentlemen are from the university, they're gonna develop a new spray for those ants.
You know what I think.
Ha! You know if she didn't have something to worry about, she wouldn't know what to do with herself.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave for a few days.
Mr. Eldridge.
Evacuation?
Look I...
Mr. Eldridge.
I... I... I don't understand this.
It's for your own protection.
Evacuation?
What's this all about anyway?
Why this isn't right.
They can't just push us off...
Didn't you hear what the man said?
It's for our protection.
When do they get their farm back?
That depends.
Friday, eight o'clock,
the zone should now be clear of population,
we can proceed with the next step.
The facility is completely self contained,
except for a primary power source
and the generator in our trucks supplies this,
the experiment has begun.
What's wrong?
Well, I guess they're not ready to play yet.
Dr. Hubbs,
there's already been a twelve day over run
which averages out at 36%
when projected over the course of the total program.
The controller would like to get the final figure
before the fiscal period ends on the 14th.
Shall we put you down for one more week?
I'm sorry, this is not a precise business.
Well, can you give us an estimate?
We cannot study the ants until they make an appearance.
Can we put you down for ten more days?
This is not a controlled experiment, in our judgment another occurrence in this area is highly probable.
But we cannot command the ants to appear.
Well is there something you could do to hurry them up?
We have been thinking about that.
You know, of course, there is concern
over possible outbreaks in other areas?
Ah, I share that concern.
My associate, Mr. Lesko, has something to say.
Listen, I want you to do me a favor -
I want you to call Miss Dobson, d-o-b-s-o-n.
6-6-2-0-7-9-9 in Los Angeles.
Tell her not to take the plane to Vegas on Thursday.
Tell her it'll be a couple more weeks and...
She'll hear from me, okay?
Did you say a couple of weeks?
That's right.
Mr. Lesko, that's not going to be possible,
accord...
Let's see some activity.
Hi, there?
Clete!
Ants.
They got the horse,
Clete, light the fire.
Kendra. Oh, my god.
Grandpa, can't you something?
Oh, my god.
Clete, get over here.
Can't you do something?
Give me the gun.
No, no, no.
Let me go.
Clete, get her in the house, get her in the house.
Don't kill him.
Don't kill him.
All set?
Keep down now.
That's right. Hang on.
Now this is really interesting.
You see what I do is I get to the parameters of the problem by breaking down the movement of a vector of a single anthill.
Now, I don't know what they're doing, I don't care,
I'm just breaking down their simple basic move.
Stop, go.
Turn, duration.
That's it period, okay?
Now I take my ant signals,
I run them through the digitizer,
I record them on tape,
I write them down and
I search for a correlation between what they say and what they do.
Now assumption.
What we're seeing and hearing are commands being directed at the central mass.
They warned us.
Relax.
I forgot to turn out the light.
Stop! Cut it out!
What's the matter?
Cut it out!
Come back here.
Goddamn it, will you sit...
They're all over the place.
Clete, take care of the women.
Get some help.
Now I make various adjustments, make up for time lag and a couple of other things don't worry about it.
Then I come up with...
Ha, are you ready for this?
I come up with a positive correlation on the order of 80% between this little squiggle and the command we commonly know as stop.
And a positive correlation between that little squiggle and go.
And that means these little mothers talk to each other.
Now I think if I...
Hey, the lights.
They've got into the generator. Don't move, the back up unit cuts in automatically.
I'm going to counter with 100% yellow.
You're letting some get away.
Maybe they've learnt something.
Come over here, James, this is really fascinating.
People are dead back there.
Yes, a tragedy.
I don't understand it, they accepted the order, why should they come here?
Irrational behavior, very sad.
Now just look at this, James.
Consider the execution of this maneuver, in order to explode the generator, they had to create a living chain...
Listen, Hubbs, those people are dead, don't you understand?
People get killed sometimes.
I think this yellow should hold it's potency for three or four days.
We can start collecting now.
Little sons of bitches.
No, no, no.
They're not individuals, they are individual cells.
Tiny functioning parts of the whole.
Think of a society, James, with perfect harmony, perfect altruism and self sacrifice, perfect division of labor, organized for preordained roles.
Think of the building, elaborate and complex structures according to plans that they know nothing of, but can execute perfectly.
Think of their ability to evolve and adapt in ways that are so beautiful, and still so unknown and all contained in one simple form.
So defenseless in the individual, and so powerful in the mass.
Well...
Let's begin with the first behavioral series, heat, cold, isolations, starvation, slow pressure, and threat.
Mantises prey on ants, as you know.
Now if...
If you're still with us, James.
When are we gonna get her out of here?
That's going to be a little difficult, I'm afraid.
Um... turn on the microphone, please?
Call in and have them send out a helicopter.
I'm afraid the bureaucrats will be rather unhappy with all of our casualties.
Now...
Mantises, at this end of the maze, the ants are at the other.
What are we gonna do with the girl?
What is your concern with her?
She's in shock, we can't just... she's a kid.
Don't shout.
This is a problem that will have to be dealt with over the next few days until we're finished.
If you won't call the base,
I will.
I'm very much afraid that that will end our mission.
Screw our mission.
I've finished eating.
You know,
I don't know your name.
Oh, Kendra.
I'm Jim.
That's Dr. Hubbs.
Come in, come on.
You sort of had a close call out there, didn't you?
How do you feel?
Well, I'm ready to go home now.
Um... I'll send a message today.
Somebody will come along and pick you up tomorrow, if that's convenient.
They killed my horse.
Kendra, I'm sorry.
Kendra!
Stop it, stop it.
Back away.
Don't touch anything.
It's alright.
That should do it.
You've been bitten.
So we thought if you knocked down one of the towers,
taking proper precautions of course,
you might get an interesting reaction.
We'll consider it.
Just an idea doctor.
Appreciated.
Oh, one other thing.
Yes?
We got a report about a family in your vicinity;
You haven't contacted any civilians, have you?
No.
Monday, 2:00 a.m.
Lesko continues to make progress,
deciphering the ant language
from the tapes recorded during the first skirmish.
If he maintains this pace,
we should be ready for their next move.
It's a rather crude language,
I think if I keep building up my library of sound words
I might even...
Strike up a conversation with them.
Of course then the ants would have to come back.
We'd have to be here for a while.
When's the helicopter coming?
Oh, it'll be here.
I'm sorry about that.
Oh, not your fault.
Listen, you really wanna see something?
Another way of visualizing their signals.
Watch this.
I don't have the faintest idea what it means.
Hey?
Remember me?
Oh, y... y... yeah!
How do you feel?
Oh... Better.
That's good.
H... h... how is um...
Dr. Hubbs?
Yeah.
Oh, he'll survive.
I'm really sorry about that I...
Listen, if I were you
I'd have popped those ants pretty good myself.
You know you've got a mean swing.
Well, the main thing is you're alright.
We'll get you out of here today.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me you like this place?
My grandparents are dead, aren't they?
Yeah, they are.
What?
Don't you have parents?
Well, you must be hungry.
Come on,
I'll get you some breakfast.
Okay.
Follow me through the hardware department.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
What do you do here?
Just a little research into statistical probabilities.
Really?
It must be interesting.
Well, we've got powdered eggs, powdered milk, powdered juice, dehydrated bacon, just like home.
James?
Are you alright?
Oh, yeah.
See you in a little while.
Okay.
Good morning James.
As you can see we're under siege.
What the hell's that?
It's more than reflected sunlight.
Our temperature is already up five degrees.
There's another interesting detail.
How do you suppose those ants managed to build on a poisonous strip where they absolutely cannot live?
Did you say five degrees?
Hmm.
In an hour and a half.
And of course the sun's not yet at full strength.
Now watch this.
An hour and a half?
Oh, you must watch this, this is fascinating, there.
Beautiful adaptation, isn't it?
We challenge with yellow chemistry, they respond with yellow creatures.
We're gonna fry in here.
Question, what do they want?
What are their goals?
They have no goals.
Well, you saw how they disabled the truck.
Listen, Hubbs,
I came down here to get in a couple of weeks of science in the sun,
I did not sign up for a war against a bunch of goddamn ants.
And furthermore, why the hell did you leave the truck out there in the first place?
Bait.
Bait?
Well, I had to get them to attack us, didn't I?
They're rather intelligent, you know.
I thought you'd observed that geometric pattern in the field?
You mean you saw it?
Of course I did.
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you?
Well, I didn't think you were smart enough to appreciate it.
With all your high class bug talk.
I was afraid that you'd be terrified and run away, and I need you.
Well, you're right about that.
When's the helicopter coming?
James, we are faced with a power that has appeared and is exerting itself.
We have the opportunity to study it, to learn from it, to teach it its limitations.
We can, in a word, educate it.
You said you called.
We can try the blue, of course, but they'd only re-adapt again.
So we have to consider other alternatives.
You mean you didn't call?
It is absolutely vital that we give them the opportunity to try their strength against ours, and learn from its consequences.
I'm gonna call in, Hubbs.
And I'm gonna tell them not only to take that girl out of here,
I'm gonna tell them to take me out of here too.
You wanna call?
You're just as fascinated by this challenge as I am.
Ah!
We're cut off.
Then our success will be all the sweeter.
Sunday, one o'clock,
the battle is on,
lesko is preparing the counteraction.
I have indicated.
The air conditioner is being adjusted
to take account of the temperature rise.
Human beings can exist in temperatures of 120 degrees
or higher.
But our computer shuts down at 90.
Kendra?
You wanna see what we're doing?
Come on, I'll show you, it's interesting.
The name of the game today is king of the hill.
You see over there?
Now we wanna knock them down before they burn us out, okay?
What's that?
White sound.
That's every sound in the world all pushed together to make one really terrific noise which we're broadcasting to those mounds out there.
And that's what it looks like as we send it out.
Okay?
Now when that sound gets out to those mounds, it bounces right back here and winds up down there.
Good.
Something's missing.
One of the sounds we sent out didn't come back.
Now let's just see if we can find out what that sound is.
There it is.
Now that's the sound we're gonna broadcast to those mounds.
And when we do, interesting things better happen.
If you think that's loud for us think about how those ants are gonna feel.
That'll do it.
They're going crazy.
James?
James?
Damn air conditioner.
I'm afraid I'm feeling rather...
Ow!
It's on fire.
Get away from it.
Get out of the way.
I just... I can't believe it.
To know our plans, our strength, our weaknesses.
Even the one machine that everything else depends on.
How could they know?
This is impossible.
They knew.
I am choosing one of my less painful moments
to record these notes.
Our equipment only functions now
for a few hours at night.
Lesko believes we're being allowed this time
for some purpose.
A hypothesis, I do not share.
If this were so
it would raise questions.
I had not considered.
"Transfer to..."
"Nag tape unit three."
"Go straight six units."
"Right 120 degrees"
"four units."
"Right 60 degrees"
"four units."
"Right 120 degrees"
"six units."
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm doing something my way.
I'm sending a message to the ants.
Yes, I've been thinking about that.
The conditioning process must be working.
But they're not all affected as yet.
They must be informed of their losses and their suffering so they can draw the appropriate conclusions.
Where is your message?
On the plotter.
This is no message.
Mathematics is the universal language among intelligent creatures.
If there's an intelligence there
I want it to know there's an intelligence here.
Go away.
Please go away.
Hubbs: We're reviewing data.
Previous analysis show...
Do you wanna drink this?
Analysis...
What?
Clear, they failed to achieve a...
They will learn we've made up our mind.
How did they know?
How did they know?
You!
Kendra: Jim! Jim!
Jim: What's going on back there?
Hubbs. Hubbs.
Come on, come on.
I am not helpless,
I will not be humiliated.
Got him!
I'm sorry.
Come on, come on.
Could you hold me for a minute?
James?
James?
If I was irrational during the heat of the day,
I apologize.
Why don't they kill us?
Why roast us in here all day, dare us to come out at night?
Why play these games?
What do they want?
I've been thinking about specialization among certain insects.
Take it easy.
Try to get some sleep.
In every ant colony...
Workers, winged males and the queen.
Ants are organized by the queen.
Keeping her alive.
She's the heart and soul of their lives.
She's at the centre.
It is she who speaks.
If she died, discipline, organization would crumble.
The war's over, Hubbs.
They have the power.
Only hope now is if they answer our message in the morning.
Convince them we're worth keeping alive.
I think I could locate the queen and kill her.
Lock the tracker onto her voice when she speaks.
What makes you think she'd speak to you?
What is it?
Th... the... the...
Lights.
Ha-ha, it's just a...
Bare in mind we still have our hard suits.
Yeah, two of them.
They're sending back my message.
Hubbs, there's more.
What does it mean?
What the hell does it mean?
A circle with a dot.
Now I know how a rat feels in a maze.
Rats in a maze.
It's almost like a controlled experiment in which we are the subjects.
Find out which rat is the smartest.
The strongest.
An intelligence test.
Could the circle be this place?
And what does the dot represent?
Could the dot be a person?
Someone they want.
Who could they want?
They want somebody?
I think so.
But why would they want somebody?
To talk to them.
You mean they...
They might be angry at someone who did them some harm?
What would they do with that person?
I don't know.
Would they let the others go free?
James.
Come here.
I believe
I've located the queen.
She's in there.
♪ Oh, sweet to walk ♪
♪ In the pilgrims way ♪
♪ Leaning on the everlasting arms ♪
♪ Oh, how bright the path ♪
♪ Grows from day to day ♪
♪ Leaning on the everla... ♪
Where are the grenades?
Used up when you destroyed the towers.
All of them?
Then we must devise something else.
James, please I...
My boots I...
Would you please,
I can't...
You're gonna walk out of here?
Trek miles through the desert?
Destroy a colony full of poisonous ants and a deadly queen?
You can't even get your boots on.
Come on, Hubbs, sit down.
What we're gonna do is send another message.
You must go!
You must show them we will not...
Man will not give in.
Did I tell you I figured out their first message?
The dot is you.
They want you.
And they shall soon have me.
I'm sorry, Hubbs, it's not gonna happen your way.
Kendra.
Stop!
She's there.
That hill, the queen.
Hubbs, you can't do it.
Now come on, come on!
Queen!
Hubbs!
Hubbs!
Hubbs!
Hubbs!
Goddamn you.
Hubbs!
I would still like to believe that given time
we could have come to an understanding.
Some rational accommodation of interests,
some agreement.
But that's not the way it's going to be.
I've made some calculations about their rate of expansion
using their intelligence and their powers of organization,
and their network of communications,
their poisons.
Their ability to adapt genetically.
I believe that after this test run now
they'll move rather quickly into desert areas.
Taking over the countryside first
then laying siege to towns and cities.
I believe they will learn as they advance,
anticipating our moves and continue to stay a move ahead.
We have only one chance,
the counter attack suggested by doctor Hubbs.
A direct assault on their queen.
Jesus, I wish it wasn't me.
There you are.
They wanted...
Us.
We knew then, we were being changed
and made part of their world.
We didn't know for what purpose.
But we knew we would be told.
"In the decade of the 1930s even the great city of Metropolis...
"... was not spared the ravages of the worldwide depression.
"In the times of fear and confusion...
"... the job of informing the public was the responsibility...
"... of the Daily Planet.
"A great metropolitan newspaper...
"... whose reputation for clarity and truth had become a symbol of hope...
"... for the city of Metropolis."
This is no fantasy.
No careless product of wild imagination.
No, my good friends...
...these indictments...
...I've brought you today...
...specific charges listed herein against the individuals...
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.
These...
...are matters of undeniable fact.
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...
...on those accused.
On this...
...this mindless aberration...
...whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction.
On the woman, Ursa...
...whose perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...
...have threatened even the children of the Planet Krypton.
Finally, General Zod.
Once trusted by this Council...
...charged with maintaining the defense of the Planet Krypton itself.
Chief Architect of this intended revolution and author of this insidious plot...
...to establish a new order amongst us...
...with himself as absolute ruler.
You have heard the evidence.
The decision of the Council will now be heard.
Guilty!
Guilty!
Guilty!
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.
It has therefore now become your decision.
You alone will condemn us if you wish...
...and you alone will be held responsible by me!
Join us!
You have been known to disagree with the Council before.
Yours could become an important voice in the new order, second only to my own!
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!
Take it! Join us!
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!
You will bow down before me!
Both you and then one day...
...your heirs!
Forgive me, forgive me...
An unpleasant duty has been masterly performed, Jor-El.
They have received the fate they deserved.
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...
...an eternal living death.
A chance for life, nonetheless.
As opposed to us.
It's suicide.
No, it's worse, it's genocide.
Be warned, Jor-El.
The Council has already evaluated this outlandish theory of yours.
My friends, you know me to be neither rash nor impulsive.
I am not given to wild unsupported statements...
...and I tell you that we must evacuate this planet immediately.
Jor-El, you are one of Krypton's greatest scientists.
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.
I don't question your data.
The facts are undeniable.
It's your conclusions we find unsupportable.
This planet will explode within 30 days.
If not sooner.
I tell you Krypton is simply shifting its orbit.
Jor-El...
...be reasonable.
My friend...
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.
This discussion is terminated.
The decision of the Council is final.
Any attempt by you to create...
...a climate of fear and panic among the populace...
...must be deemed by us an act of insurrection.
You would accuse me of insurrection?
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?
You would be banished to endless imprisonment...
...in the Phantom Zone:
The eternal void...
...which you, yourself discovered.
Will you abide by the Council's decision?
I will remain silent.
Neither I, nor my wife...
...will leave Krypton.
Have you finished?
Nearly.
It's the only answer, Lara.
If he remains here with us...
...he will die as surely as we will.
But why Earth, Jor-El?
They're primitives, thousands of years behind us.
He will need that advantage to survive.
Their atmosphere will...
...sustain him.
He will defy their gravity.
He will look like one of them.
He won't be one of them.
No.
His dense molecular structure will make him strong.
He'll be odd. Different.
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.
Isolated. Alone.
He will not be alone.
He will never be alone.
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters is now in excess.
Our data indicates the loss is due to a misuse of energy.
Investigate.
And if the investigation proves correct?
He knew the penalty he faced.
He even is a member of this Council.
The law will be upheld.
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.
But we will never leave you.
Even in the face of our death...
...the richness of our lives...
...shall be yours.
All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel...
...all this and more, I...
...I bequeath you, my son.
You will carry me inside you...
...all the days of your life.
You will make my strength your own...
...see my life through your eyes...
...as your life will be seen through mine.
The son becomes the father, and the father...
...the son.
This is all I...
...all I can send you, Kal-El.
...which Einstein called his theory of relativity.
Embedded in the crystals before you...
...is the total accumulation of all literature and scientific fact from dozens...
...of other worlds...
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.
Early Chinese writings point out the complex relationship...
By carrying this complex equation to its ultimate power, my son...
Chief among these powers will be your sight...
...your strength, your hearing...
...your ability to propel yourself at almost limitless speed.
The early history of our universe was a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.
Each of the six galaxies which you will pass through...
...contain their own individual law of space and time.
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.
- What!
- What was that?
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...
Oh, Pa!
Oh, my.
All these years, as happy as we've been...
...how I've prayed the good Lord would see fit to give us a child.
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.
You take things easy now.
Remember what Doc Frye said about that heart of yours.
Now the first thing we've got to do when we get home is find out...
...who that boy's proper family is.
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.
Are you thinking what I think you are thinking?
We could say he's the child of my cousin in North Dakota...
...and just now orphaned.
Jonathan, he's only a baby.
Martha, now you saw how we found him.
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening to what I'm saying?
Come on, gang.
That was a great game.
All right.
Come on, hustle, let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.
Remember about the uniforms, cleaned and washed...
...by tomorrow, and looking like a football team.
Let's have those clothes washed and ready for tomorrow's game.
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.
Can you give me a lift?
Lana?
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up to Mary Ellen's.
Play some records.
Would you like to come?
Sure.
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...
All that?
Oh, Brad!
Hey, come on, Lana.
Come on, let's go.
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.
'Bye, Clark.
'Bye, Clark.
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.
Golly! I saw a boy out there run as fast as the train!
Faster, even!
Lois Lane, you have a writer's gift for invention.
- I'll say that for you.
- But...
Lois, please read your book.
No one ever believes me.
Hey, look, there's Clark!
Clark?
How did you get here so fast?
I ran.
Ran, huh?
Told you he was an oddball, let's get out of here.
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
Yeah, I know you can do all these amazing things...
...and sometimes you think that you will just go bust...
...unless you can tell people about it.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.
- That's for sure.
- Every time.
Is it showing off when somebody's doing the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?
No, now, you listen to me.
When you came to us, we thought...
...people would take you away...
...when they found out the things that you do.
It worried us a lot.
Then when a man gets older and he thinks very differently.
And things get very clear.
And there's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.
I don't know whose reason, or whatever the reason is...
...maybe it's because...
I don't know.
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll race you to it. Yeah.
You will?
Run. Come on, come on. Move, move.
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.
Jonathan!
Dad.
All those things I can do...
...all those powers...
...and I couldn't even save him.
Clark, get up.
Good morning, Smiley.
Clark, breakfast.
Are you going to sleep all day?
Clark, come on. Get up.
I have to leave.
I knew this time would come.
We both knew it from the day we found you.
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.
He said that he'd be happy to help out from now on.
Mother!
I know, Son.
I know.
Do you know where you're headed?
North.
Remember us, Son.
Always remember us.
My son...
...you do not remember me.
I am Jor-El.
I am your father.
By now you will have reached your eighteenth year...
...as it is measured on Earth.
By that reckoning...
...I will have been dead for many thousands of your years.
The knowledge...
...that I have of matters, physical and historical...
...I have given you fully on your voyage to your new home.
These are important matters to be sure...
...but still matters of mere fact.
There are questions to be asked...
...and it is time for you to do so.
Here, in this...
...this fortress of solitude...
...we shall try to find the answers together.
So, my son...
...speak.
Who am I?
Your name is Kal-El.
You are the only survivor of the Planet Krypton.
Even though you were raised as a human, you are not one of them.
You have great powers, only some of which you have...
...as yet discovered.
Come with me now, my son...
...as we break through the bars of your earthly confinement.
Traveling through time and space.
Your powers will far exceed those of mortal men.
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.
Rather let your leadership stir others to.
In the next year, we shall examine the human heart.
It is more fragile than your own.
As we pass through the flaming turmoil which is the edge of your own galaxy...
...we will enter the realm of the red Krypton sun...
...source of your strength and nourishment...
...and cause of our eventual destruction.
The Planet Krypton, my son...
...your home as it was.
This year we shall examine the various concepts of immortality...
...and their basis in actual fact.
The total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies...
...is embedded in the crystals which I have sent along with you.
Study them well, my son.
By the time you return to the confines of your galaxy...
...twelve of your years will have passed.
For this reason, among others...
...I have chosen Earth for you.
It is now time for you to rejoin your new world...
...and to serve its collective humanity.
Live as one of them, Kal-El...
...and discover where your strength and your power are needed.
But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage.
They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be.
They only lack the light to show the way.
For this reason, above all, their capacity for good...
...I have sent them you...
...my only son.
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
Smile.
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?
Two.
What are you writing?
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?
M- a-s-s-a-c-r-e.
Thanks.
Golly, how come you get all the great stories?
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.
A good reporter makes them great.
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.
The way I see it, it's a headline on the front page with my picture...
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.
So does a lady wrestler with a foreign accent.
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.
This could be the basis for a series of articles:
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings" by Lois Lane.
We get psychologists, sociologists, interviews...
Lois, you're pushing a bunch of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.
The Daily Planet has a tradition...
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shake it up like that.
Of course not, Lois.
Why would any one want to make a total stranger look like a fool?
I'll take that.
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.
And don't call me sugar.
Right... Sugar.
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.
Lois, why don't you take Kent out to meet everybody, huh?
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.
I'm giving him the City beat.
Chief!
That's my beat!
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just a mild-mannered reporter...
...but not only does he know how to treat his Chief with the proper respect...
...not only does he have a snappy, punchy prose style...
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business, the fastest typist I've ever seen.
That's great.
Here, you forgot my article.
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...
...if you could arrange for half my salary...
...to be sent to this address on a weekly basis.
Your bookie, right?
My what?
Don't tell me!
He sends a check every week to his sweet, gray-haired mother.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you very much, Mr. White.
Well?
Any more at home like you?
Not really, no.
I didn't think so.
Well, get yourself a desk over here.
Over here?
Here, there's some paper and a file right there.
Sorry.
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.
- What?
- Kent.
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.
I haven't been since I was seven.
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.
How did you like your first day on the job?
The hours were sort of longer than I expected...
...but on the whole, meeting you and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.
- "Swell"?
- Yup.
You know, Clark...
...there are very few people left in the world...
...who feel comfortable saying that word.
- What word?
- Swell.
Really? I always thought it was kind of natural.
- Sorry.
- Clark.
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.
Rex, this is...
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you...
Lois?
Hey, where you going?
Can I help you with your coat?
- Thanks, can you get that?
- Sure.
Did you like Mr. White?
He was a nice guy and Jimmy was fantastic.
Come here. Come on.
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.
We'd better get out of here.
We'd better do what he says, Lois.
Come on, get in here, quick.
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.
We're coming.
Excuse me.
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.
Okay, okay. Hold it there.
Just a minute.
Now I realize that...
...times are tough for some these days, but this isn't the answer.
You can't solve society's problems with a gun.
You know, buddy, you're right.
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you. That's the spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
Of course!
Now come on, lady, hand it over.
Lois, I think you'd better...
Lois! What are you doing?
Are you all right?
What happened?
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.
Really, Lois, supposing that man had shot you?
Is it worth risking your life over $10...
...two credit cards, a hairbrush and a lipstick?
- How did you know that?
- Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Wild guess.
Taxi!
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.
So, what's happening, partner?
Look what we got.
Let's take him.
Wait a minute.
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.
Lex Luthor?
You got it, Aramus.
We'll make Captain by midnight.
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.
Hey, what do you read?
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.
Just getting a Daily Planet here.
Okay. All right.
See, I'm paying him, and I got a pretzel, too.
Thanks, Otis.
How many bags, Shutzy?
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.
Let's go.
Your attention, please.
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready for departure...
...on the upper level. Track 6.
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?
All right, Aramus. All right.
Now boarding on the lower level...
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...
Board now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation to Buffalo, Syracuse...
Smoking cars are forward, move along now.
Luggage at the top.
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.
So that's it!
It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to keep those legs moving.
Harry...
Harry, where are you? Harry?
Sick!
Sick, you're really sick!
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?
Sick when we're days from executing the crime of the century?
No. Step away from that, please.
How do you choose to congratulate the greatest criminal mind of our time?
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.
Charismatic?
Fiendishly gifted?
Try twisted!
Get away from that, get away!
Tell me, Lex.
Why do so many people have to die for the crime of the century?
Why? You ask why?
Why does the phone always ring when you're in the bathtub?
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader of our time...
...surrounding himself with total nincompoops?
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.
I was just talking about you.
You were followed again.
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?
Yes.
Then why am I not reading it?
Because I haven't given it to you yet?
Right.
At last it's official.
Thanks to the help of the US Government...
...we are about to be involved in the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.
Lex, what is this...
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."
When I was 6 years old, my father said to me...
"Get out! "
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...
"... utilities and transportation systems may collapse...
"... people are no damn good, but they'll always need land...
"... they'll pay through the nose to get it."
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."
It's a pity that he didn't see...
...from such humble beginnings how I've created this empire.
An empire. This?
How many girls do you know have a Park Avenue address like this?
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?
Do you realize what people are shelling out up there...
...for a few miserable rooms off a common elevator.
What more could anyone ask?
Get this Loch Ness update right into composing.
Yeah, no that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed, right.
Why are you standing here for?
I'm not.
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.
The sex maniac profile.
Right. Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.
Hi, Clark. Good night.
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.
Lois, have you got a minute?
Excuse me, please.
And these two go to the addresses on the envelope, okay?
I was wondering if you'd have dinner with me?
I'm sorry, I'm booked.
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...
...you-know-who answers the questions he would rather duck.
Don't you ever let up?
What for? I mean I've seen how the other half lives.
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.
I would go bananas in a week.
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.
Maybe we could...
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.
Good night.
Going down, please, going down.
Going down?
Going up. Up, up.
Good night.
Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.
Planet One, go ahead.
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.
We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.
Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.
Roger, Over and out.
A malfunction, can't get lift off.
- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?
Set it down.
My God, we've lost motor control.
I can't hold it.
I can't hold it.
He's lost it.
Wake up.
Help!
Step back, folks.
Get back. Move over to the other side of the street.
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.
There's a helicopter up there.
Help me.
All right, folks. Let's move back.
Let these firemen get in here.
Help me!
Hold it. Get back.
Get off the street, folks.
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.
Hold these crowds back. Move.
Help!
Say, Jim...
Excuse me.
That's a bad outfit.
Okay, move these people.
My God! Look up there.
What the hell's that?
Easy, miss. I've got you.
You've got me? Who's got you?
I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.
Gentlemen, this man needs help.
I hope this little incident hasn't put you off flying, miss.
Statistically speaking, of course, it's still the safest way to travel.
Right.
Wait!
Who are you?
A friend.
'Bye.
Something wrong with the elevator?
Going down?
Officer.
Good evening, Officer Mooney.
They say confession is good for the soul.
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Move your ass! Come on!
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.
Bad vibrations?
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.
With a big red cape and bright red boots as well.
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!
With bright red boots?
Take the night off.
Go back to Murphy's bar and continue what you started.
I'll be off in a few minutes and I'll meet you there.
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.
Frisky, will you come down from there.
Hi. I'll get him.
Come on, it's all right.
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.
'Bye.
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.
Then this man swooped out of the sky and gave him to me.
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?
Metropolis currently ceiling 500, overcast 700 broken...
...visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.
Roger.
Doesn't look good. What do you think?
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.
Bring up two and three.
We haven't got enough pressure to keep going.
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.
We have lost port outboard engine and part of wing.
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.
Notify them the President's on board.
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?
What the hell's going on out there?
Fly, don't look, just fly.
We got something.
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.
You enjoyed it.
I don't know what to say, Father.
I'm afraid I just got carried away.
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.
You couldn't have imagined...
How good it felt?
You are revealed to the world.
Very well.
So be it.
But you still must keep your secret identity.
Why?
The reasons are two.
First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.
As it is, in earth time.
Your help will be called for endlessly.
Even for those tasks that human beings can solve themselves.
It's their habit to abuse their resources in such a way.
And secondly?
Secondly:
Your enemies will discover...
...their only way to hurt you...
...by hurting the people you care for.
Thank you, Father.
Lastly:
Do not punish yourself with your feelings of vanity.
Simply learn to control them.
It is an affliction common to all, even on Krypton.
Our destruction could have been avoided but for the vanity of some...
...who considered us indestructible.
Were it not for vanity...
...at this very moment...
...I could embrace you in my arms...
...my son.
Reports are coming in of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...
...from almost certain destruction...
...rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter from the Daily Planet, with one hand...
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.
That'll be the day.
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.
I don't know. You would be surprised.
...some sort of fantastic hoax.
Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?
Miracle or fraud? The answer...
- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?
Turn it off.
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?
If he is, he's not from this world.
Why?
If any human being was gonna perpetrate such a hoax, it would have been me!
My robe.
Right away, Mr. Luthor.
It all fits somehow, this coming here to Metropolis...
...and at this particular time.
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.
To commit the crime of the century, a man wants to face the challenge of the century.
Listen, maybe this guy that flies is just sort of passing through.
Passing through?
Not on your life, Otis...
...which I would gladly sacrifice by the way...
...for the opportunity of destroying everything that he represents.
And, Otis, by the way, next time put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.
Now look.
The Post, "It Flies."
The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."
The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."
The Planet. We're sitting on top of the story of the century here.
I want the name of this flying whatchamacallit...
...to go with the Daily Planet like bacon and eggs...
...franks and beans, death and taxes, politics and corruption.
I don't think that he'd...
...lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes.
Exactly how would you know that?
Just first impression.
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.
- Right?
- Right, Chief.
I want the real story.
I want the inside dope on this guy.
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?
Why did he show up last night?
Where does he come from?
Does he have a girlfriend?
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?
Now listen to me, I tell you, boys and girls...
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...
...is going to wind up with the single, most important interview since...
...God talked to Moses!
What are you standing around about for?
Move!
Get on that story.
"8:00," he said. Some friend!
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust! "
Good evening, Miss Lane.
Did you have plans this evening?
This old thing? No.
- I could come back later.
- No!
Don't move.
Sure you can move.
Just don't fly away, all right?
Sorry to drop in on you like this, but I've been thinking.
There must be some questions people'd like to know the answers to.
Yes.
You really shouldn't smoke.
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?
Well, not yet, thank goodness.
Would you like a glass of wine?
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.
Nice place.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Shall we get started with the interview?
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?
No, I'm not.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, I don't. But...
If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.
How old are you?
Over 21.
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.
And how big are you? How tall are you?
About 6' 4".
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?
Around 225.
I assume then that...
...the rest of your bodily functions are normal?
I beg your pardon?
Well, putting it delicately...
...do you...
...eat?
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.
You do. Of course, you do.
Well, then is it true...
...that you can see through anything?
Yes, I can, pretty much.
And that you're totally impervious to pain?
Well, so far.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Did I embarrass you?
- No.
- I did.
No, it's just that this planter must be made of lead.
Yes, it is. So?
I sort of have a problem seeing through lead.
That's interesting.
Problems with lead.
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.
Pink!
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.
You didn't embarrass me.
What's your background?
Where are you from?
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.
Krypton.
Cripton! With a C-r-i...
No, actually it's Krypton, with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n.
Do you like pink?
I like pink very much.
Why are you?
Sorry?
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice and the American way.
You'll end up fighting every official in this country.
You don't really mean that.
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?
I never lie.
How fast do you fly, by the way?
I don't know. I've never actually bothered to time myself.
Say?
Why don't we find out?
And how do you propose we do that?
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- Are you serious?
- Sure.
Don't you want to go?
You won't need these.
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.
Ready?
Clark said that you were just a figment of somebody's imagination.
Like Peter Pan.
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.
Can you read my mind?
Do you know what it is that you do to me?
I don't know who you are.
Just a friend from another star.
Here I am, like a kid out of school.
Holding hands with a god.
I'm a fool.
Will you look at me?
Quivering.
Like a little girl shivering.
You can see right through me.
Can you read my mind?
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?
Wondering why you are...
...all the wonderful things you are.
You can fly.
You belong in the sky.
You and I...
...could belong to each other.
If you need a friend...
...I'm the one to fly to.
If you need to be loved...
...here I am.
Read my mind.
We forgot to time ourselves.
Maybe next time.
You okay?
Good night.
Good night.
What a super man!
Superman!
Anybody home?
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.
For goodness' sake, didn't you hear me knocking?
We did have a date tonight, remember?
You haven't been...?
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.
I mean, I need a purse, and I have to fix my hair...
...put some blush on.
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...
I was at first really nervous about tonight.
But then I decided, darn it, I was going to show you the time of your life.
That's Clark nice.
We could go for a hamburger or whatever you want to do.
Now then...
...given the exact location of the galaxy that he mentions...
...and the proximity to our own solar system...
It's amazing. Amazing!
Too good to be true.
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...
...doesn't drink or smoke and tells the truth.
Some people can read War and Peace...
...and think it was an adventure story.
Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper...
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe?
Right, Miss Teschmacher.
"N."
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.
So there you go, "M."
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...
..."nincompoop," "nitwit," and "L" as in "ladder."
Here's a ladder, coming right up.
I didn't see...
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.
In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton...
...exploded in 1948.
That ridiculous little freak...
...took three years in a rocket to get to earth.
- Ergo...
- Ergo.
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.
He's 6' 4", you know that?
Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me?
It's your weight and my I.Q.
Think, people, think.
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...
...exploded and went into outer space.
It is reasonable to assume...
...that some of those particles of debris drifted to Earth.
Meteorites!
Jawohl.
Voilà!
Voilà!
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?
I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but...
...so what?
So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites.
Fair enough.
But the level of specific radioactivity...
...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton...
...this substance is lethal.
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...
...but this stuff here...
...will kill him.
Doesn't it give you a kind of...
...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me?
Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him.
He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his.
O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see...
...nor can Superman, through lead.
He can't see through lead?
And Kryptonite will destroy him.
Any questions, class?
I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?
Looks like a burnoose.
It's just a wraparound.
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.
Everything looks good, see you at the base. Over and out.
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.
Look at this!
Looks pretty bad.
Take her pulse.
Get an ambulance down here.
I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to.
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.
Yes, sir!
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.
Get an ambulance.
Gather around.
Turn around!
Hi.
Somebody hurt?
I did it, Mr. Luthor.
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?
I set the first directional vector...
...to 38.
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.
What about the fourth one?
What fourth one?
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!
The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7.
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.
Would you like to see a long arm?
Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm?
No, Mr. Luthor.
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.
I thought you told me this road would be blocked off?
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.
All right. Follow me, men.
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.
This man is a diabetic, you see.
As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam...
...but what I don't understand...
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met?
You don't know his name.
At the stupid high price he offered...
...for this worthless piece of desert...
...I hope it's Custer!
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.
Reporting live from the launch site, ground zero.
Today marks a historic occasion since...
...two XK-101 rockets will be launched simultaneously.
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?
No, but the Chief wants to see you.
You're blocking the set, Clark.
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?
Good.
Excuse me, Mr. White.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?
She's out West, looking into a land-fraud deal.
I sent young Olsen with her on his first assignment.
Some unidentified clown is buying thousands of acres...
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.
That doesn't seem to make sense.
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.
People break into a museum at night, kill two people, and what do they take?
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?
I've never been able to understand violence.
I know that about you.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...
...and I got where I am with guts, compassion...
...elbow grease and something you're sadly lacking in, son.
Humility?
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.
This is Lex Luthor.
Only one thing alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency.
That's you.
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet containing propane lithium compound...
...will be released through thousands of air ducts in this city...
...effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis.
I was a reporter before most of my friends were copy boys.
I want you to get Lois to introduce you to Superman.
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?
I know it all seems a bit much...
...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?
I knew you'd never accept an invitation to tea.
But a disaster, with people in danger, people who need help...
I just knew you couldn't resist that chance to sort of pitch in.
You know what I mean?
There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.
But then nobody's perfect.
Almost nobody.
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.
Tell me what you see?
Cuteness, dimples.
You like cuteness?
Dimples.
I'll give you dimples.
The pressure is still on you.
You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...
...get out of the tunnel.
It's your last chance, Superman.
Why don't you do yourself a flavor and freeze.
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.
He's definitely coming.
It's open, come in.
My attorney will be in touch with you about the damage to the door.
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.
I don't think he wants me to.
Where's the gas pellet?
Somewhere.
It's in the back of my mind, actually.
It's a little idea I was toying with.
Is that how a warped brain like yours gets its kicks?
By planning the death of innocent people?
By causing the death of innocent people.
Fire!
Navy Bird, we have a good launch.
Navy missile...
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...
...very heavy into real estate.
To make money, you have to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?
Right.
So, the problem?
How to make the land more valuable between the time you buy it...
...and the time you sell it?
Now this is California.
The richest, most populous state in the Union.
I don't need a geography lesson from you.
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?
Where was I?
- California.
- California, right.
The San Andreas Fault, maybe you've heard of it?
Yes. It's the joining together of two land masses.
The fault line is shifting, which is why you get earthquakes in California.
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Everything west of this line is the richest, most expensive real estate in the world.
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.
Everything on this side of the line...
...is just hundreds of miles of worthless desert land...
...which just happens to be owned by...
Lex Luthor Incorporated.
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...
...planted at just the proper point would...
Would destroy most of California.
Millions of people would be killed and the West Coast as we know it would...
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.
"Otisburg"?
Miss Teschmacher, she's got her own place.
"Otisburg"?
It's a little bitty place.
Otisburg?
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.
I'll admit there were a few problems.
Adjusting the precise trajectory of the missile.
Finding the optimum stress point for the fault line itself...
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...
...here.
That's impossible!
What's happening, Lieutenant?
Trajectory malfunction, sir.
Abort.
All counter control units...
...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.
Function negative, sir.
Can't you knock them down?
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.
Get me the Pentagon.
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.
Would you go to the viewing room, please?
But as for the rest, it's nothing but a sick fantasy.
Fantasy?
No.
It's history. It's happening, Superman.
Miss Teschmacher!
Yes, Lex?
Where's the rocket now?
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon, so is the other one.
The other one?
There are two of them?
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.
Even you, with your great speed, couldn't stop both of them.
While I, on the other hand, could stop them with my detonator.
All right, Luthor, where is it?
Where's the detonator?
Diseased maniac!
Do you think you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead?
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.
Don't touch that.
I told you.
It's Kryptonite.
A little souvenir from your hometown.
I've spared no expense to make you feel at home.
You were great in your day.
But it just stands to reason...
...when it came time to cash in your chips...
...this old diseased maniac would be your banker.
Mind over muscle.
You don't even care where the other missile's headed, do you?
Certainly I do.
I know exactly where it's headed.
Hackensack, New Jersey.
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.
Mine's in California.
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.
Please, you can't...
...you can't just stand there.
You can't just stand and let millions of innocent people die.
Maybe.
Please, help me to save them.
Would you promise to save my mother first?
But, Lois, and Jimmy...
But my mother comes first.
If you promise, I'll believe you because you always tell the truth.
I promise, I promise.
Why did you kiss me first?
I didn't think you'd let me later.
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.
Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys?
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.
Army Bird still heading due east.
Navy Bird still heading due west.
Losing radar contact.
Next radar contact after three seconds.
Army Bird still headed east, sir.
Army Bird gaining altitude.
Miss Teschmacher!
Radar contact strong.
Miss Teschmacher!
Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.
Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.
15 seconds and counting.
A military missile has exploded in the Southern California desert.
The force of the explosion has activated the San Andreas fault.
California is suffering a major earthquake.
What's going on?
It's a quake! Look!
Okay, kids, it's all right now.
Hey, it's Superman!
Holy mackerel!
We're going off the tracks.
All personnel evacuate dam.
Watch that cable!
Someone try and pull the main.
It's impossible. It's red hot!
Is that man all right?
Yeah.
Hang on, Jim.
The dam broke.
You're safe here, son.
That's okay. Miss Lane will be driving by any minute.
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.
There has been major quake damage to Southern California.
The San Andreas fault has miraculously sealed itself.
Yet Southern California is suffering an aftershock of a major earthquake.
The population is still warned to be aware...
Please, come on, turn over.
Come on!
Help me. Help me, please.
It is forbidden for you to interfere...
There's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.
It is forbidden.
All those things I can do.
All those powers...
...but I couldn't even save him.
It is forbidden.
Hi.
Don't bother, it's dead.
Sure it's dead.
The problem with men of steel is they're never around when you want one.
Do you know what happened while you were off flying around?
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.
To top the whole thing off, this stupid car runs out of gas.
I'm sorry about that, Lois.
But I've been kind of busy for a while.
I'm sorry, that's all right.
Thanks a lot, Superman.
Put me in the middle of nowhere during an earthquake.
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.
He can't stay still for a second.
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...
Clark... Wait a minute.
What?
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.
But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...
You're messing up my suit!
Otis! Watch the ground, you...
Good evening, Warden.
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.
Who is it, Superman?
Lex Luthor.
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.
...that these walls...
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!
You, you nitwit!
Nincompoop!
This country...
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.
No, sir.
Don't thank me, Warden.
We're all part of the same team.
Good night.
This is a routine pursuit.
Main Force repeats, this is a routine pursuit. Code 44.
Listen, you tell them we need help.
This should be an open-code blitz and you know it.
You have your information.
Come on, sweetheart, this one's a heavyweight!
Main Force repeats, you have your information.
This is a routine pursuit.
Please liaise with Big Bopper.
Jesus, March Hare to Big Bopper.
Assist on Code 3 Red Alert.
Big Bopper. Gotcha, Hare.
What's going down?
- We've got a cop-killer.
- You're kidding!
Be warned, Sarse...
... this is non-compliance.
The Main Force will not tolerate such action.
This pursuit is designated a standard Code 44.
Please respond only to that code.
Code 44 indicates no requirement for a blockade.
A Pursuit Special has been stolen.
Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee doesn't like this any more than you.
However, we must not compromise territorial range.
Remember that only by following instructions...
... can we hope to maintain a successful highway program.
March Hare to Big Bopper.
We're three minutes off the intersection.
Can you make it?
We'll make it! Move over!
I'm driving!
Not this again! I've been assigned!
Hang on. I'm supposed to drive this crate!
Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this thing?
A twisto bikey, scoot jockey.
A few hours ago, down in Sun City, he goes berserk.
Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie and takes off in a Pursuit Special.
We've been on him ever since.
This one's right up the air, Roop.
I've seen the style before.
Terminal psychotic.
What's he driving?
That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s.
Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey!
We're about half a mile off Anarchy Road.
You'll see him any minute now.
Rip the guts out of it. Give it the B-Jesus!
See him yet?
Got it!
I'm gonna blow him away!
I'm gonna ram him!
Hey, fellas, you okay?
Acknowledge, Big Bopper.
Acknowledge, are you okay?
Do you see me, Toecutter?
Do you see me, man?
Keep going, we're okay.
We got you, we're going.
Born with a steering wheel in his hand...
... and lead in his foot.
He is the Nightrider...
... cruising at the speed of fright!
I am the Nightrider, and we ain't never coming back!
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!
I am a rocker! I am a roller!
I think we're still mobile.
For Christ's sake, shove over!
You're blaspheming again.
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.
I am the Nightrider!
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?
Understand this.
That scag and his floozy...
...they're gonna die!
Main Force to Gosling One.
Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond.
MFP to Gosling One.
Main Force to Gosling One.
It was like slow motion.
He leaves his seat and goes through the windscreen...
...headfirst straight into the tree, right?
And then bounces back through the windscreen.
By the time we got to him, he was just sitting there...
...trying to scream with his face ripped off.
What's the matter?
Not hungry, am I?
Give it here.
- I'll tell you what"..."
- Look at that.
- Christ!
- Strewth, at it again.
Catch you later, Goose.
Christ, they're heading for population!
What's this I hear about you and Jonathan?
- What about him?
- You were seen with him two nights ago.
So what?
It's this way.
He's gone.
Bastards!
Shit!
You're gonna get it this time.
- He had his indicator on.
- Shut up!
No, you're not going on. Stay off the road!
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!
People's lives are in peril!
Stay off the roads!
I'm gonna have him!
Stay off the roads!
Get off the roads!
- I got him! Shut up!
- Stay off the roads!
Oh, my God.
I am ready.
I am ready for your best.
Oh, my God, what happened?
I don't know, man. I just got here myself.
I think he broke his leg.
I want to find out what's happening.
Max, can you hear me?
Main Force Patrol...
...we're out of the game...
...unable to continue pursuit.
You'd better send a meat truck.
Charlie's copped the saucer in the throat.
Hey, Max?
Max?
Go ahead.
We are 100 percent SNAFUed.
You okay, Goose?
Nothing a year in the tropics wouldn't fix.
Much damage?
You should see the damage, Bronze!
Metal damage...
... brain damage?
You listening, Bronze?
I am the Nightrider!
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.
I am a rocker! I am a roller!
I am an out-of-controller!
I am the Nightrider, baby...
... and it's me and my Marmaduke, and we ain't never coming back.
The Toecutter, he knows who I am.
I am the Nightrider!
I am the chosen one, the mighty hand of vengeance...
... sent down to strike the unroadworthy!
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.
Step right up, chum, and watch the kid...
...lay down a rubber road right to freedom!
What's wrong?
- Baby, what's wrong!
- Nothing.
It's going.
There'll be nothing left. It's all gone.
Stop!
That feels good.
After three days, that feels so good.
I got a right hook in the mouth this morning.
Sprog?
I told him to always lead with his left.
You know, I think we've got a monster on our hands.
Yeah, takes after his old man.
What's that?
Monster!
Montazano, who called himself the Nightrider...
... had broken from custody and escaped in the police vehicle.
You made the news again.
Who was he?
I don't know.
Just another glory rider, I guess.
Jessie, I told you.
The Goose wants me there early.
What for, he didn't say.
You know the Goose.
Coffee's ready.
I'm not grumpy.
Get out of here.
Okay.
I gotta go.
What's that?
Crazy about you.
All supplies must be requisitioned from the people's bond.
Please do not exploit your privileges.
Doing so is an offense.
Memorandum Seven:
The Captains of the Hall have asked that pursuit officers...
... refrain from using the slang "Bronze" for the Main Force Patrol.
The word is considered disrespectful...
... and citizens should be actively discouraged from its use.
Memorandum Eight.
Hospital vouchers are available again.
MFP personnel may sign on with the following sector captains.
One, six three, two four, one one two...
... five seven, and two six.
Kick it in the guts, Barry.
She's the last of the V8s.
You can shut the gate on this one.
It's the duck's guts.
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.
Sucks nitro.
Phase 4 head.
- Twin overhead cam.
- Tell him about the blower.
- 600 horsepower.
- The blower, man.
She's meanness put to music and the bitch is born to run.
- He's in a coma, man!
- He loves it.
How the hell did you get all this together?
It just happened, Max, you know?
A piece from here and a piece from there.
- So easy?
- Yeah.
Come on, Max. You've seen it.
You've heard it...
...and you're still asking questions.
When do we go for a ride?
He loves it.
I think we've got him.
I hope so.
Yeah, we've got him.
Your top pursuit man wants to quit the road...
...and we have to seduce him with candy?
People don't believe in heroes anymore.
I know, Macaffee. You want to give them back their heroes.
You will not try this one on me again.
I do not enjoy wasting money.
Goodbye...
...and good luck!
Thanks, Labatouche.
You're a real human being.
Get out of my way!
The old meat grinder's humming tonight?
Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies over the high side.
Will you shut up!
The hot mops and the towees.
It's in the food.
Another one for your books, eh?
Have you eaten yet?
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.
That Code 3 you ran down a few days ago"..."
- The Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.
- Got a problem.
- What's that?
His friends. Word is they're out to get you.
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.
Well, I'll add it to my threat collection.
Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
We're here to meet a friend.
Come in on the train.
Nothing come in on the train except a couple of crates and a...
...coffin.
Our friend.
You'll have to see the agent and sign the papers.
Where do we find...
...this agent?
Wait.
That must be your friend there.
Didn't leave much of him.
Must have cut his heart out?
Yes, that's what I meant.
Poor bastard.
The Nightrider.
That is his name.
The Nightrider.
The Nightrider.
Remember him...
...when you look at the night sky.
I will.
Take your hat off.
Anything you say.
Anything I say.
What a wonderful philosophy you have.
Take him away.
Bubba. Johnny.
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?
Nightrider!
Nightrider!
Nightrider!
No worries.
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.
Rockatansky.
We have incident at Wee Jerusalem.
Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.
Okay, we're on it. We gone.
Goose, come on.
What's this?
It's a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card.
- Any more details?
- No.
Okay, we're gone.
- Max, he looks"..."
- Yeah.
Hey, fella, stop!
Hey, fella, stop!
What a turkey!
Hey, fella, you're a turkey, you know that?
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.
Nightrider. My "Niqueur."
Pursuit units in sectors, eight, nine and ten.
A cyclecade of nomad bikers.
A fast run out of Wee Jerusalem.
Your instructions are to locate.
Do not engage.
Sector Eight. Nomad bikers.
Bronze!
Gonna get you!
It's okay.
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.
It's all right.
This one's whacked out of his skull.
Whacked right out of his skull, man!
He ain't never coming back.
It's all right.
I'm gonna let this go now.
I know you're frightened, girl...
...but no one's gonna hurt you anymore.
My name's Jim Goose, and everything's gonna be all right.
The Nightrider!
Hey, Jimbo.
- Remember that Code 3?
- Yeah.
Remember him when you look up"..."
Nightrider!
Well, well, well.
Johnny the Boy has done it again.
This time it's a scrubber.
He's never gonna learn.
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.
You are going back for him.
No way! Not me, not for him!
But it's not for him.
It's for me, Bubba.
You're wasting your time!
The Scag don't rate!
He's nothing like the Nightrider!
Code seven progress, eight one.
Code seven progress, eight three.
Code seven eight six, eight one, eight zero.
MFP Code 1.
Captain Macaffee in convoy from the courthouse to the Halls of Justice.
Code one progress.
Hey, mister.
What happened to the car?
What do you think happened?
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.
Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety.
Hey, Roop.
Stay here, mate.
I think they're out there.
Take your time, Charlie.
We got plenty of it.
Good day and good luck.
I can see the Interceptor.
What do you say, Scag?
Got no place special to go?
We'd better prep him.
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?
No contest.
Hey, Fif! What's going on?
- What happened?
- Let him go.
What's he mean, "Let him go"?
Who's this?
- Keep out of this.
- What's going on?
No one showed, okay?
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.
No one showed. No one.
What's he mean, "No one showed"?
They didn't show.
Nobody! The punks didn't show.
The girl didn't show, the townspeople didn't show.
Nobody showed!
We're screwed! It's the law.
What do you mean, "No one showed"?
Where were you, man?
It means, old man, you haven't got a case.
No contest.
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna let him walk out the door, Fifi?
That's exactly what you're going to do!
- Shut up!
- Keep going, Charlie!
It's alright.
Hey, Bronze, look at you, a cripple and a mute!
Scag, he sings and I tap dance!
Hey, you know what you are?
The courts will hear about this.
I promise they'll hear about this disgrace.
He wearing that face for a bet or does he really look that stupid?
This man is grossly offensive!
Get him out of here, Max!
- I can make a case of it!
- What case, you fool?
You saw what they did to that girl!
For God's sake, she was the town bike!
He's my prisoner, and he's not walking out that door!
- Get him out of here!
- Who is this guy?
Goose, settle down, boy.
Jesus, Fifi.
Fifi, Jesus.
Look, they're laughing at us!
Can't you see they're laughing at us?
They don't believe us!
See you later, Goose.
It's been a pleasure.
Skiffington, go home. Go.
Goose!
You can't do anything about it!
We know who you are, Bronze!
We'll see you on the road, Scag!
See you on the road like we saw the Nightrider!
We remember the Nightrider, and we know who you are!
Okay.
So long as the paperwork is clean, you boys can do what you like out there.
Here he is, the walking armpit!
There's a fire in my belly, and she's the woman to put it out.
Off, brute!
This angel is hot in the tubes for me!
I'm on fire!
Joviality is a game of children.
- She's mine.
- I should be a surgeon with these hands.
Mudguts, get out of there!
Cundalini, put her against the post.
We have a problem here.
She is not what she seems.
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority...
...she's sent by the Bronze, full of treachery.
The Bronze, take our pride.
If you're gonna waste the Bronze, you gotta do it big!
You just don't have the style, do you, chicken shit?
Goes to water on a dummy.
It's all right. It's okay.
Just remember...
...to keep your sweet...
...sweet mouth shut!
MFP to Gosling One.

Main Force.
Would someone inform the Goose...
Yeah, baby!
All units again progress.
All units again progress.
All units again progress.
... units to Three Day Angel Patrol.
Nice to have you back Big Bopper Two.
Sun City Sector 3,

A Memorandum:
For the cannibalization...
MFP, copy.
Hey, it's the Goose.
You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash.
Hey, Midge...
...don't write off the Goose, until you see the box going into the hole.
Yeah, well, don't wreck me truck now.
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Yeah, no hurry.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
Couldn't be righter.
Jimmy the Goose, larger than life and twice as ugly!
Light me, Johnny.
Light another.
This is a threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.
Light it!
The Bronze, they keep you from being proud.
Look at him. He looks silly, doesn't he, upside down?
Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!
I can't. No!
You scum-sucking trash!
Throw it!
I can't stand the pain!
Max.
That "thing" in there, that's not the Goose.
No way.
I was hungry.
Peanut butter and honey.
I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess.
He was so full of living, you know.
He ran the franchise on it.
Now there's nothing.
Here I am, trying to put sense to it...
...when I know there isn't any.
I'll be all right, once I get it clear in my head.
- What's this?
- I'm through.
- Again?
- No, not again.
- I'm through. I'm quitting.
- Sit down.
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,
I came to say it. I'm through.
Now, just a minute!
All right, so the Goose bought it.
That's the way he always came at the world.
Off beat.
Max, you'd be the first to admit it was long overdue.
All right, I'll tell you how it is.
You're a winner, Max.
You're on the top shelf...
...and I'm not gonna lose you because of some crazy notion about quitting!
They say people don't believe in heroes anymore.
Well, damn them!
You and me, Max...
...we're gonna give them back their heroes.
Do you really expect me to go for that crap?
You gotta admit,
I sounded good there for a minute?
'Bye, Fifi.
Come on, do you want me to beg?
Do you want me on my knees, crying?
Now just a minute.
Give me a reason.
I'm scared, Fif.
Do you know why?
It's that rat circus out there.
I'm beginning to enjoy it.
What is this, funny week?
Any longer out on that road, and I'm one of them, you know?
A terminal crazy.
Only, I've got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys.
You know what I'm trying to say?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Take off a few weeks?
Grow yourself a beard.
Draw flies. Just think about it for a while.
If you still feel the same way when you come back, it's okay by me.
Go on.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Get out of here before I decide to come with you.
'Bye, Fif. Thank you.
You'll be back, Rockatansky!
You're hooked, Max.
And you know it!
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess, about how I feel.
Guess I always counted on you understanding.
When I was a kid...
...me and my father used to go for long walks.
I remember staring down at his shoes.
They were special shoes, brown.
And he always kept them really shiny.
He was tall, and he used to take long strides.
And there I'd be right alongside him...
...just trying to keep up with him.
I don't think he ever knew how proud I felt of him.
Or how good it felt just to be there alongside him.
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel"..."
The thing is, Jess...
...I couldn't tell him about it then, but I can tell you about it now.
I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you how I'm feeling about you right now.
Get a load of that!
We had a blowout a while back.
Raunchy, very raunchy.
What's the donk like?
Yeah, the donk's fine.
Look, about this tire"..."
Don't do much work on these myself, except to scrape 'em off the road.
Yeah. Hey, how about this tire?
Have it fixed in no time.
I can sell you a set of 'lops for next to nothing.
I can't remember where I got 'em, but I got 'em, know what I mean?
No, we'll be all right just as soon as we get this fixed.
- Max?
- Yeah?
Listen...
...Sproggo's talked me into buying him an ice cream, so...
...I think I'll see you later.
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.
They'll appreciate the business.
Sure, thanks.
Toodlepip.
You just trucking around?
Good time for just trucking.
Wish I could do a bit myself.
Which way you heading? North?
Maybe.
Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner.
Main course and dessert.
My favorite kind:
Female.
Watch the tongue, lovable.
I've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean.
Must've spent some coin.
Like the sign says, speed's just a question of money.
How fast do you wanna go?
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?
Just take my word for it, get in!
- What about the tire?
- Please, Max!
Your tire, man.
Hey, fella, what about your tire!
Hey, fella, what about your tire!
Crazy people!
The world's full of crazy people.
That wagon, was it here?
A couple with a kid.
I was just fixing their tire.
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either.
- Who are they?
- A couple, passing through.
Said they were heading north. Maybe.
You want to drive the car? Yeah?
Well, we wouldn't have a car anymore.
Into the back.
Here you go.
I can still see his face now.
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.
What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss?
That's enough from you, mate! Enough.
What's the matter with you?
What you got there, mate?
Yeah, that's the way I see it, too.
Sure. It's been nice talking to you". '"Bye.
Take it you agreed with him.
They're not worried, I'm not worried.
What about that?
I figure it's lost property.
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.
Sounds okay to me, Jess.
Don't know.
If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay.
May's expecting you up at the farm sometime.
You'll have no more trouble up there.
Just green grass.
How are you doing?
I'm getting there.
I reckon you ought to connect the doohickey to the gizmo.
Come here, you.
You touch me with those hands and I'll rip you apart. No!
Look at them! No!
May told me about the little beach down by the trees. Do you want to come?
Love to.
Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt, or we're never gonna get outta here.
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.
If you meet Benno down there, don't let him bother you.
He's only a baby.
Sure, May.
- The men.
- What men?
Now you calm down and you tell me what's the matter.
Very, very naughty.
- Now, you tell May what you...
- May.
May, you call The Dark One.
And you tell him to get here as fast as he can.
Why? What's going on?
I think we've got some hoon trouble.
It's gonna be all right.
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.
Well, let's go into the house.
You've had an awful time, darling.
But it's all over now.
Everything's going to be all right.
I've just got to go and make a phone call...
...and then we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
The Dark One, and hurry it up, will you?
It's May Swaisey.
Sprog? Oh, no!
Sprog?
Sprog!
Sprog!
Well, well, well.
It's our little mother.
That there is Cundalini...
...and Cundalini wants his hand back.
I want my baby.
Tell you what...
...l'll swap you.
Please, give me my baby.
Jessie.
You've not got a sense of humor.
You've got a pretty face, though.
Awful pretty.
Awful pretty.
I suppose...
...you don't need a sense of humor with a pretty face.
The only trouble is though, missy...
...if you should...
...lose the face...
Please, don't hurt my baby.
...you've got nothing!
What do you want from me?
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!
Right there!
- I hate guns.
- Old lady.
Stand back!
- Stay back!
- Woman!
Stay back!
Anyone so much as breathes,
I'll cheese him!
Open that door.
Everyone of you, in there.
Put the babe on the ground.
Jessie, get the van.
Don't stop. Just go right through.
Now what?
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?
I don't know, it just died on me.
Jessie!
Where?
Lord, have mercy!
What do you reckon?
I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.
This your subdural?
- Yes, that's her.
- Lot of problems?
Multiple traumas, spleen, liver, lung, flail chest...
...left neck of femur, renal shutdown.
Reads like a grocery list. She salvageable?
Yeah, sure, we got all her signs back last night.
- Relatives?
- The husband.
They lost the kid. DOA.
Listen, tell him she's going to be all right.
Tell him not to worry.
Tell him, if he wants, I'll talk to him.
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.
He's been standing there like a zombie all day.
Bubba Zanetti, is that you?
You come for the grunt?
She won't be ready until this afternoon.
Still having trouble with the front forks.
They're mongrels to work with.
You asshole!
What the molly fuck you think you're doing?
You and me are gonna talk about the Toecutter.
Never heard of him.
What the Christ are you?
I wanna know about the tattoo.
I mind my own business, don't I?
I mean, they'll kill me, won't they?
I'll say the names, and you say "yes" or "no"."
Nightrider...
...Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes.
There's more?
- Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?
- Yeah. Some others.
- Where?
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.
Are they coming back?
I don't know. They gotta get their bikes.
For Christ's sake!
I don't know.
Code Unspecified.
We have a query locate on a black Pursuit Special.
Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer.
This is designated as a potential
Code 3 Red Alert.
Quit toying, Bubba.
Easy. I know what I'm doing.
Hi.
This isn't what it looks, man.
I just came down here to check it out, and...
...this guy, he's already snuffed it.
Nothing you could do for him.
Ankle.
It's okay.
What are you doing, man?
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do with anything going on back there, man.
Listen, man, will you? Listen to me!
They were a hell of a lot of crazy people back there, man.
Some kind of bad people.
I'm not responsible for anything.
What are you doing, man?
What do you say? What are you doing?
Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man.
I'm sick, see? Sick.
What do you call it?
Psychopathic, you know.
Personality disorder.
The court, man, he said so.
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?
Jesus! You can't kill me!
Not for stealing a man's boots!
He was dead, for Christ's sake!
He won't need 'em anymore.
What are you doing?
I wanna know what you're doing.
The chain in those handcuffs is high-tensile steel.
It'd take you ten minutes to hack through it with this.
Now, if you're lucky...
...you could hack through your ankle in five minutes.
Go.
You're mad, man!
You think I look silly, don't you?
Don't bring this on me, man.
Don't do this to me!
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!
Don't bring this on me, please!

Come in.
A gentleman to see you, professor.
You have come to help me?
Sit down. Sit down.
I must talk to somebody.
Nobody will listen to me.
- I must have help with my researches.
- Of course.
Even now it may be too late.
Too late. Do you understand?
There is so much to do.
I must have a qualified doctor to assist me.
You are a qualified doctor?
I asked for a qualified doctor.
Yes, of course.
My work is of the utmost importance...
...for the survival of the human race.
Do you believe in evil, doctor?
I do not mean evil as it is commonly understood.
I mean the existence of evil as a living organism...
...as a plague, a disease, which infects humanity like cholera or typhoid...
...an epidemic slowly spreading until it affects the whole world.
Evil is a disease...
...a disease which can be prevented or cured like many others.
Come. Come. I will show you.
These.
Here.
Now, you are looking at the very essence of evil itself.
The isolated bacillus of the most deadly plague of all.
But you see. You see with your own eyes. They all see.
Yet nobody believes.
You must believe me.
I alone have looked into the face of evil.
I alone possess the knowledge of how to combat this terrible force...
...which I stand guilty of unleashing upon the world...
...3000 years ahead of its appointed time.
Some people even say that I am mad.
Everything is here.
Everything is documented.
I am a scientist, not a madman.
Three years ago I had just returned from New Guinea...
...where I'd been searching for the remains of primitive man.
I brought back what I thought would be...
...the most sensational scientific discovery of the century.
The complete skeleton of a primitive man...
...which would revolutionize our ideas of the origin of our species.
- Right. Start to unload.
- Right.
Emily!
- Emily!
- Yes, miss.
Emily, it's Father. He's back.
- Welcome home, Father.
- Penelope, my dear, dear child.
Oh, how good to see you again.
Let me look at my little girl.
Yes, I do declare.
I do declare you've grown taller.
Oh, it's good to see you again, so very good. And so good to be home.
Everything the same.
Why, even to Martha.
- Martha, how are you?
- It's Emily, Father.
Emily? Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.
How stupid of me.
Emily, nice to see you.
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you. It's Emily, yes.
Waterlow, my old friend.
Welcome home, professor.
And well-timed.
I'm just concluding the final experiment you suggested in your last letter.
Good, good. We have a lot to talk about.
And much, much to do.
Be careful, please! That way.
Waterlow, take them through to the laboratory, will you?
Now take care. Whatever you do, don't stand it upright.
- Keep it horizontal. It's very delicate.
- Horizontal it is.
Excuse me, dear. I must just check that this specimen...
...has survived the journey intact.
Careful.
By the way, what did happen to Martha and the other servants?
I'll explain it all at breakfast.
You will be taking breakfast with me?
Why, yes, yes, of course.
We also have a lot to talk about.
Give me just a few minutes and I'll be with you.
Yes.
Can you get around it?
Put it over there.
- Don't hit the table with the experiments.
- I won't.
- Right. Over there.
- All right.
- Right.
- Let me just clear the things off the top.
There we are.
- The auger must be worth a few...
- Waterlow, I've done it.
I've found it. This is it, my friend.
This will change everything.
We'll have university fellowships.
We'll write books.
Might even win the Richter Prize.
Richter Prize. 10,000 pounds.
Why, we can have a better laboratory...
...new equipment.
I could double your salary.
And it's not only us who will benefit, but the whole world.
All right. Thank you very much, sir.
Good morning.
Come on.
Old skinflint.
Him and his "Riggler" prize.
10,000 pounds.
Just a moment.
Bless you. Thank you, miss.
Excuse me, miss.
- Will your father be taking breakfast?
- Oh, I do hope so, Emily.
We have so much to discuss.
This advanced scientific research is to a point I'd never have credited before.
But when he goes to the laboratory, it will take more than breakfast...
...with his daughter to pry him out.
If you hadn't returned this week, my experiments would have stopped.
Oh, that's of no importance now.
This is what we must concentrate upon.
Every means at our disposal.
Fantastic, isn't it?
Now...
...note the difference between these two skulls.
Neanderthal man: Primitive, ape-like.
They had very, very small brain cavities.
Now compare that with this new specimen.
Far greater brain capacity.
You may inform my father that breakfast is ready, Emily.
Sir?
Breakfast is ready now, sir.
- Breakfast, sir.
- Oh, no, no, Martha. Not just now.
No. I'm extremely busy.
Miss, your father says he's busy at the moment.
Very well. Perhaps you'd ask him again in a few minutes.
- Yes, miss.
- Thank you.
The strange thing is that I found this skeleton in these rocks here.
Whereas the remains of Neanderthal man...
...which I found on my previous expedition...
...were in this layer here.
Therefore, this new skeleton must be much older than the Neanderthal.
Yes. Anything else?
But the new one seems to be more advanced.
Why, exactly, Waterlow!
Which means all our theories of evolution are turned upside down.
My discovery proves that there was advanced intelligent life on Earth...
...far earlier than thought. This is the link scientists have been searching for.
Come in.
This will revolutionize scientific thinking.
Excuse me, sir.
Miss Penelope sent me...
...to ask if you'd come take breakfast with her.
Oh, yes, of course.
Tell her I will join her directly.
I'm sorry to have been so long.
- I'll get you your breakfast.
- You look after me so well.
I'd like to hear what you've been doing during my absence abroad.
I trust you have not neglected your music lessons while I've been away.
No, Father.
And... Just tea, thank you.
And all the domestic arrangements have proved satisfactory?
I had to dismiss two of the servants as you may have noticed.
Oh, yes. Martha and...
Why, my dear?
We can't afford them, Father.
It's been so hard these last
12 months making ends meet...
...saving pennies here, pennies there.
It's been such a strain.
What would I do without you, Penelope?
Ever since your dear mother died, you've been everything to me.
But you won't have to worry anymore.
This time my discoveries will bear fruit.
I promise you.
- What is it? You're not unwell?
- Oh, no, Father. I'll be all right.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Father.
Perhaps you spend too long alone in this house.
Now that I'm back, you'll be able to go out again. The two of us together.
Just as soon as I've completed my present work.
- Yes, Father.
- Excuse me.
My dear brother, although this letter will not reach you until your return...
...I unhappily write to inform you that your wife passed away this morning.
Needless to say,
I have respected your wishes...
...and have not informed Penelope.
Is something wrong, Father?
Nothing that need concern you, my child.
Oh, good afternoon, sir.
Drive on, coachman.
Giddap there.
Naturally, I'm sorry, Emmanuel, but we must treat your wife's death...
...as a merciful release for you both.
There was no improvement towards the end? No...
I'm afraid not. We had to continue treatment until the last.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
During your absence we made the appropriate funeral arrangements.
Marguerite is buried here in the cemetery if you wish to visit the grave.
Thank you.
And Penelope? How is she?
I don't imagine she'll be disturbed by this...
...because she's believed her mother to be dead for many years.
When are you going to tell her the truth about it?
I can't.
You know I can't.
What do you mean?
For so long it's been on my mind that her mother's...
...illness might be hereditary, that it might recur in Penelope.
James, you're the authority in this field.
Is such a thing possible, or am I worrying needlessly?
Very soon I hope to be able to answer that.
The answers, and many others, will be in this manuscript when it is published.
I'm entering it for the Richter Prize.
- The Richter Prize?
- Yes, Emmanuel.
Things have changed.
It was always you who was destined for great success...
...whereas I was only the poor, hard-working half-brother...
...whom you had to put up with.
Now it is I who am a success.
I intend to win that prize, Emmanuel...
...and the prestige that goes with it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have many matters to attend to. Oh, yes.
Your wife's documents, committal papers, death certificates, et cetera.
You'll find them all in order.
Very grateful.
One moment.
I want to make it quite clear that I do not propose to continue...
...to subsidize your ridiculous expeditions to the ends of the Earth...
...to prove your lunatic theories about the origin of man.
Good day.
- Lenny's escaped, sir!
- Escaped?
He smashed the door, knocked the guard out and got away.
- The lock must have been...
- Well, get after him! Sound the alarm!
- Good evening, my dear.
- Good evening, Father.
And what are you reading?
It's called romance.
I'm not sure that I approve of that sort of literature.
Where did you get it?
You have not been out?
No, Father. I haven't left the house since you were awake...
...except to walk in the garden.
- Then how did you get this magazine?
I found it on a bookshelf.
I thought it was one of Mother's.
Your mother's?
- But I have forbidden you...
- Yes, Father.
You've forbidden me to talk about her, mention her name or to enter her room.
Don't you understand? I never knew her. She died when I was too young.
- I thought by reading something that...
- My dear child.
My every thought is for your welfare.
You are my beloved responsibility.
I've tried to keep from you anything which might cause you distress.
- I'm so sorry if I've failed.
- I love you, Father.
But I must know about Mother.
Can you lock away memories just by locking her room?
You must trust me.
I do know what is best...
...for both of us.
Continue with the experiment, doctor.
We'll discuss the conclusions later.
Oh, good evening, doctor.
Give me the keys.
I want to see how Lenny escaped.
You think you ought to go in there, sir?
You'd better take this, sir.
Drop the keys!
Go back to your cell!
Drop the keys!
You should've used this on Lenny.
Let's hope we find him before he goes berserk again.
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir.
Thank you.
Carry straight on here.
And keep your eyes skinned as you go through those trees.
Oh, dear. What a mess.
No!
The water mustn't touch the skeleton.
Get another cloth!
Quickly!
I was only trying to clean it, professor.
Hurry.
I'm afraid there's no trace of this Lenny man in the local area, sir.
He might have headed for London.
It would help us if we could have a more detailed description of the man, sir...
...if that's not too much trouble.
- Of course not, officer.
Every one of my patients here is fully documented.
Here we are.
This is the most recent photograph we have. You may keep it.
Oh, thank you, sir.
We'll do our best.
Well, I only hope your best is good enough, officer.
Look at this! The morning paper.
This institute can do without a scandal.
Well, sir, if I might venture to point out...
...are you sure your security arrangements are satisfactory?
Perfectly satisfactory.
- I inspected them myself only last night.
- Oh, thank you, sir, and good day.
I thought I'd examine the structure of the flesh tissue.
Can I help you, professor?
I cannot find my volumes on folklore of the New Guinea primitives.
I was looking for them last night.
Have you seen them?
Miss Penelope recatalogued the library while you were away.
The particular books you want are in the drawing room bookcase.
Be a good fellow and get them for me, will you?
Certainly.
Oh! I returned the keys to you, professor.
Oh, yes, you did.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- Good morning, Mr. Waterlow.
- Excuse me, Miss Penelope.
Those volumes on the New Guinea primitives, your father wants them.
Now...
...let me see.
Folklore.
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Now...
...listen to this in relation to what happened last night...
...when I was cleaning the skeleton.
It's about the primitive people of New Guinea today...
...who believe that their ancestors were a race of giants...
...who carried on a titanic war between good and evil...
...when the world was created.
"When the evil one shall be exposed, the Sky Father shall weep. "
"Weep," Waterlow.
That means rain. Water.
"... weep for the departure of Paradise from the Earth, and his tears... "
Water again, do you see?
"... his tears falling upon the evil one, will give him life. "
Now that is precisely what happened last night here in this room.
"And so the battle between good and evil will continue on the Earth. "
Well, I really don't understand.
- It all seems rather difficult.
- Don't you see the parallel?
In the normal course of erosion...
...this skeleton will be exposed on the surface...
...in approximately 3000 years.
By which time the people of New Guinea should've developed...
...a state of scientific knowledge equivalent to ours.
And then the Sky Father will weep.
Rain, Waterlow, rain. Water.
And last night I anticipated that process by 3000 years.
Why, I am the White God.
I alone hold this tremendous power of good and evil in my hands.
If I can control this power, what opportunities are open for humanity?
Why, with this knowledge I could wipe evil away from the world.
It could be abolished forever.
We would have a new paradise...
...here on Earth.
That's...
...food for thought, Waterlow.
Outwardly, the flesh looks quite human, but let us look further.
Living blood cells.
But not ordinary cells.
Let's have a look at some of mine.
Now, these ordinary, human blood cells...
...are completely different, of course.
Now...
...let us see what happens when we mix the two.
- A little bit of mine.
- And a little bit of his.
Now mix them together.
Thank you.
Now, Penelope,
I want you to be a good little girl...
...and promise me that you will not go into your mother's room.
I miss her so much.
When will mommy be home, Daddy?
I do want to see her again.
Since evil is a disease...
...it could therefore be possible to immunize man...
...by some form of inoculation.
Good. Yes.
That'll do.
Now, theoretically, Waterlow, if a minute quantity of evil serum...
...were introduced into the bloodstream of an individual...
...that individual should be proof against contamination...
...by the evils of this world for the rest of his or her life.
We must prepare a serum from the evil cells and put it to a practical test.
Where is Mommy?
Why can't I see her?
I do want to see her.
I don't want your mother's room disturbed.
I want her to find it just as she left it.
Dear Penelope, you are everything to me.
And since your mother's death, when you were so young...
...I've tried to be everything to you.
My every thought has been for you.
You must trust me.
I do know what is best for both of us.
I've prepared a sample of the monkey's blood, professor.
Splendid.
Yes.
That should have been time enough.
Thank you.
The serum has formed a protective film around each cell.
Now, the question is...
...can this protection withstand...
...the forces of undiluted evil...
...withstand an attack from the blood taken from the newly formed flesh?
I wonder.
It can.
- So far, success, Waterlow.
- Congratulations, professor.
A new day is dawning for mankind.
We'll continue in the morning.
- Good night, professor.
- Good night.
Marguerite.
Marguerite.
- Marguerite.
- Father.
Penelope.
This is your mother's room.
How dare you.
How could you do such a thing?
How dare you.
Why didn't you tell me about her?
Why?
- You said she was dead. Why? Why?
- It was for your own good.
- Your own good.
- All the time...
All the time you kept the memory of her alive up here in this room.
You never loved me.
You never loved your own daughter.
You had room only in your heart for her.
You never had any left for me.
All the time she was a prisoner, like me.
Why didn't you let me see her?
Why?
You want everybody to be a prisoner.
You wanted her kept a prisoner, locked up in that dreadful place.
I'm nothing to you!
Bravo!
Marguerite...
Help me!
Help me!
No!
Help, Emmanuel!
Help me!
No.
No, no, not Penelope.
I won't let it happen to her.
Please, forgive me, Father.
My dear child...
...I shouldn't have been angry with you.
Perhaps I should have told you about your mother.
I wanted to protect you.
I thought it was for the best.
Steady on, love.
At least buy me a drink first.
He's mad, that's what he is.
No, No! Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it. Stop it!
That's the man?
Yeah. I'd know that face anywhere.
I can deal with most brawlers myself, but this bloke was a madman.
Well, even old Len Gaskel here, he was hiding behind the bar.
And it takes a lot to shake old Len.
Look at it.
I see.
Come on, get this place cleared up!
Oh, my God!
Professor!
- Professor!
- What's the matter?
Come down here quickly.
- Please come quickly, sir.
- What's wrong, man?
What's the matter?
The serum.
Thank God we didn't use it on a human being.
Penelope?
We've traced Lenny to the East End of London.
We think he's still there.
It'd be advisable if we could take a couple of your staff with us.
Very well.
Send the security coach and give the inspector all the help he requires.
- Yes, sir.
- One other point, sir.
In view of this man's violent nature...
...I can't guarantee to bring him back alive.
Just bring him back, inspector.
Sir.
What can I do for you, sweetheart?
One of those.
That'll be tuppence.
Tuppence, I said.
Come on, you've got some money.
I can see you're not hard up.
Another one.
- I want another one.
- When you pay for that one.
Come on, pay up.
Otherwise I'll call a copper.
I've had trouble with your sort before.
It's for the gin, landlord.
And for another.
The young lady is with me.
Not having a very good evening here?
Perhaps I can brighten it up a little.
Come, come, my dear.
We don't put our goods on display unless they're for sale, do we?
It's my mother's dress.
I like that.
It's very good.
We'd better go upstairs and test the quality of the material.
Landlord, we're going upstairs.
All right, sir.
You know the way.
Now, we can stop pretending, can't we?
So...
...you keep up the pretense even here, do you?
Very well.
Time you learned a thing or two.
Everything all right, sir?
When I want that sort of thing,
I'll ask for it.
Get her, somebody!
Get the police!
Stop her!
Stop her!
She's getting away!
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
Right down here.
Come on.
Right around there.
Come on.
Around the corner here, in the old warehouse.
Near the gate.
- Get in there. Near the gate.
- Let's get this girl.
Get back!
Let's stop a minute. Now, get back now.
All together! Right.
Come on again! Together!
Come on!
It's going. It's going.
All right.
- Look!
- There she is. Up there.
I can't see her really.
Where?
She's got a thing in her hand.
I think she pushed him.
She pushed him.
She's laughing. She's smiling.
Please, help me.
There she is, sir!
Get away! Go! No!
Don't touch me!
No! No!
- No sign of her?
- No.
- Can I do anything while you rest?
- No.
No, you'd best go home, Waterlow.
I'll send a message if I need you.
Thank you so much for waiting.
- Any results?
- No apparent reaction.
It's impossible to tell whether these lights have any affect at all.
Could we be on the wrong track with your electrical-wave theory?
No, no. I'm convinced I'm right.
We've got to make a breakthrough.
The experiments on the patients prove nothing. They're already insane.
And until you can artificially cause insanity, you can prove nothing.
Unfortunately, in the state of society as it exists today...
...we are not permitted to experiment on human beings.
Normal human beings.
Let me go.
Lenny's dead, sir.
A woman was with him.
They brought her here.
I've taken a blood test from her.
I'd like you to see it.
- Won't it wait?
- I think you'd better look at it now, sir.
Very well.
It's been on my mind for so long that her mother's illness...
...might be hereditary, that it might recur in Penelope.
Is such a thing possible, or am I worrying needlessly?
Unfortunately, in the state of society as it exists today...
...we are not permitted to experiment on human beings.
Normal human beings.
- Miss Penelope.
- Get her inside, quickly!
- Take her upstairs.
- Yes, sir.
- Go on, quickly.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep her under constant supervision.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, dear.
- What are you doing in here?
- Oh, Emmanuel.
It would appear that your research is following similar lines to my own.
How dare you come spying in my laboratory.
There's no reason why we shouldn't pool our resources, is there?
- What do you mean?
- Come, come, Emmanuel.
There's no need to be so evasive.
I happen to know that your experiments have misfired.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I see you won't listen to reason.
Now, I suggest you tell me everything you know.
What are those black cells?
How do you isolate them?
And what association do they have with insanity?
I do not know what you're talking about.
I shall ask you to leave my house immediately.
You'll have to tell me, you know.
I could ruin you if this scandal became known.
- Scandal?
- Yes, scandal.
You would be utterly ruined professionally if it were learnt...
...that you had experimented on your own family.
Fortunately for you, however, your daughter was brought to my asylum.
Penelope?
Where is she now?
All right. All right, Penelope.
All right. All right.
All right. Lift her.
Now, all right.
You say that the black cells only appear in the patients...
...who are capable of extreme violence.
Yes. I've taken samples from all the patients.
Then it's conclusive.
Emmanuel says here that he can only obtain the cells in their pure state...
...from the living tissue formed around the bone.
Could that be the bone of the skeleton he talks about?
And how do you form living tissue around dead bone?
It seems absolute nonsense to me.
There's something that he hasn't mentioned in these notes.
I've got to get hold of that skeleton somehow.
I don't know. There is the question of professional ethics.
Oh, indeed. Indeed.
That is why I'll have to employ someone for whom ethics have no significance.
Emily.
Is that you, professor?
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Who is it?
What are you doing here?
The key.
Penelope, give me the key.
Please.
The Sky Father shall weep.
"Weep," that means rain. Rain!
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Giddap there! Come on!
Get on there!
Giddap.
I'll get help.
Dr. Perry! Harness the security coach, man. There's been an accident.
- What happened?
- Don't ask questions. Hurry up!
Come on.
Get on!
Halt.
Emmanuel.
It can't be.
We must find him. Quick.
Oh, no.
No. No!
No. No!
Oh, for God's sake.
No. No.
No. No!
No! No!
No, please, no. No!
What is it you want of me?
No. No. Oh, please, no!
Stop!
Get her.
This creature walks upon the Earth.
Mankind will be engulfed in great disasters: Wars, killing.
On a far greater scale than ever before.
The pestilence of evil is spreading.
I alone can save the world.
You are going?
You're not going to help me?
We are helping you, professor.
That's what we're here for.
Yes, I agree with you entirely,
Dr. Hildern. He's completely insane.
The most amazing fantasies.
They even involve you.
He thinks you're his half-brother.
That's quite normal in these cases.
I'm a sort of authority figure for them, so naturally, I appear in their fantasies.
The poor fellow even believes that this patient is his daughter.
How long has he been here?
Oh, three years, I think.
Yes, three years.
The year I won the Richter Prize.
Hopeless case, I'm afraid.
Help me. Help me.
Help me.
Please help me.
You're not looking at me, Mike.
You're not looking at me in the eyes.
That's weak.
Only weak people do that.
I could look you in the eye if I wanted to, Daddy.
I just don't wanna look you in the eye.
I guess you're just a weak person.
You must have got that from your mother.
It probably would have been better for you... to have been born a girl.
Then we could have named you Michelle.
You see, weakness is more acceptable in a girl, Michelle.
I'm sorry, I mean, Mike.
I keep forgetting.
Wait a minute.
Why don't I call you Michelle all the time?
Then I wouldn't have to be so goddamn ashamed of you and your weaknesses.
I could think of you as a girl all the time... by your frocks, dresses, and frilly hats and scarves.
You could be Daddy's little girl.
I wouldn't have to be so fucking ashamed of being seen with you in public, would I?
What do you think of that, Michelle?
Sound like a good idea?
Don't, Daddy.
What?
Did you say something?
Such a soft little girl's voice.
I couldn't hear what you said.
I hate you, Daddy.
- Speak up, girl!
- I hate you!
I hate you, because I love...
It makes me feel... guilty inside, hate.
I can't let the heart speak.
Then don't speak.
Don't speak to me. Show me.
Don't tell me.
I'm not interested in what little girls say.
Show me!
Show me your anger.
Then I can understand it.
There you are, Daddy.
I see you, Michelle.
I see everything.
This is me, Daddy.
This is what you do to me inside.
Go all the way through it.
Go all the way through it to the end.
Come out the other end.
Don't stop in the middle.
I'm watching you.
I'm watching everything you do, Mike.
Wow.
The man is a genius.
Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all for coming this afternoon.
I believe your bus is waiting outside now.
Thank you.
Candy... it's me, honey.
Daddy.
Okay, honey.
Warm enough?
Okay, put the whale down. Turn around.
Hold your hair up.
Oh, my God.
Sorry, Hal... but Mr. Carveth is still here.
He's starting to get passionate about the whole thing.
Okay, send him in.
Mr. Carveth.
Thanks a lot.
Frank, it's been some time.
What can I do for you?
I want to see Nola.
I want to see my wife, now.
You know she's still undergoing intensive therapy.
I can't let you break that isolation.
You let her see Candice on the weekends, don't you?
Yes, Frank, I do. But that's different.
Visits from her daughter was in her program from the very start.
Her program has just changed.
What do you mean?
You sound hostile.
My daughter's been beaten severely... and scratched and bitten!
Her mother did it... her mother, who is under your psychiatric care.
That's an incredibly heavy accusation to make.
Did Candice tell you that?
Candice won't talk about it.
She pretends the whole thing never happened.
But it was Nola... or some other crazy you have stashed away up here.
Either way, no more weekends with Mommy.
The kid stays with me.
To take Candice away from her at this stage... could send Nola over into the deep end.
It's a critical time for her.
I happen to think that Nola's been in over her head for a long time now.
You have no legal right to deny access.
Any time you'd like to test the matter in open court...
I'd be more than happy to oblige.
For the ultimate good of your own family, Frank... we'd be prepared to do just that.
But don't you force it.
You bring Candy back to her mother next weekend. She won't harm her.
There must be some other answer to what you've seen.
Until you give me that answer...
Candy is not coming back.
Yes, Hal?
Prepare Nola Carveth for another session tonight, will you?
Sure.
And, Chris... make it phase two, after supper.
Okay, Hal.
This guy Raglan is strictly an emotional opportunist.
He's a legit M.D., right?
He's a real psychiatrist.
Yes.
Goddamn it, psychoplasmics is a rip-off.
It's a sideshow. I've seen it in action.
It doesn't matter what you think.
You listen to me.
You call up this Raglan, and you be a real mensch with him.
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time before the cops show up at your door... and you lose your kid for good.
The law believes in motherhood.
If I can dig up enough testimony to prove... that Raglan's a dangerous fraud, that Somafree is crawling with crazies... it's no place for a kid, any time...
You're getting warmer.
But when Candy doesn't show up at Somafree next weekend... your wife can take legal action immediately.
You could find yourself belted with a writ in seven days.
If I give Nola enough time, she'll really hurt the kid.
I know she will.
I'll do anything I have to.
Here's your daddy.
I bet he knows all about this zipper.
There we go.
All set, now.
I'd love to talk to you sometime soon, Mr. Carveth... about school activities and Candy.
You missed the last open house.
Okay, soon.
Thanks.
See you tomorrow, Candy.
Thank you very much, Frank.
- For what?
- For bringing me my grandchild.
I know if it were up to Nola,
I'd never see Candice.
Juliana, that's not true.
Nola and I both know how much she needs her grandma, especially now.
You're sweet.
I guess you know, now, what it feels like.
- What it feels like?
- Being a parent.
Being blamed for everything.
To have the past distorted, so you don't even recognize yourself anymore.
Your child's version of the past, that is.
Juliana, Candice is only five.
She's working on it right now, believe me.
Thirty seconds after you're born, you have a past.
And 60 seconds after that, you start to lie to yourself about it.
I guess I've been indulging in a horrid bout of nostalgia these last few days.
It must be the weather.
At least now I have a partner in crime.
- I've got to go.
- Of course.
'Bye, Daddy.
Take your time, we'll both be just fine.
I'll be with you in a second, sweetie.
I'm just gonna get a refill, and then we'll look at those lovely old pictures.
Mommy.
Yes, Candice?
Yes, sweetie?
Mommy, you hurt me.
You hit me with your fists, and then you scratched me with your nails.
You hurt me.
I didn't, sweetie.
You must have had a bad dream.
Mommies don't do that.
Mommies don't hurt their own children.
They don't?
They never do?
They sometimes do.
Sometimes, but then they're bad mommies, they're fucked-up mommies.
Like whose?
Like whose mommy?
Like mine was.
Fucked up and bad.
No, I'm not, Nola.
You're being so unfair, sweetheart.
Mommies never do that.
Mommies never hurt their own children.
You did hurt me.
You beat me and you scratched me.
You threw me down the stairs.
Show me what I did.
Don't stop it now, darling, show me.
Show me your anger. Show it to me.
Go all the way through it.
Go all the way through it, till the end.
Right to the end.
That one's my favorite.
This one's your favorite?
Yes, Mommy in the hospital when she was a little girl.
That's right. I remember this picture.
Your Grandpa Barton took this picture.
Tell me the rest of the story that goes with this picture.
Why was Mommy in the hospital so much?
Some days, she would wake up and she would be covered... with big, ugly bumps.
And the doctors were very worried, because they could never find out... what those bumps all over her skin really were.
I guess I didn't stack the dishes too well.
I better go see what the damage is.
While I'm there,
I think I'll freshen up both our drinks.
Jerry.
Hi, Frank.
You're really falling behind on this.
The Brenleys think that they are going to be moving in here by May.
We're not going to make that, for sure.
Maybe by June.
I heard that the city plumbing permit got held up... because of a change in the building code.
Mr. Carveth.
Telephone call for you.
- Hello.
- Is that Mr. Carveth?
- Yes.
- Mr. Frank Carveth?
- This is Frank Carveth.
- This is Sgt. Martel, with 78th Division.
One of our officers noticed a broken kitchen window... while on a routine patrol of the neighborhood.
He found your mother-in-law's body in the kitchen.
The murder weapon was on the floor, next to her.
He then found your daughter upstairs, sound asleep in the bedroom.
It seems she missed the whole thing.
- Where is she now? I'd like to see her.
- With our police psychologist, Dr. Birkin.
- Psychologist? Why? Was she hysterical?
- No.
On the contrary, she was very cool throughout the whole thing.
A little too cool, I thought, so I asked Dr. Birkin to talk with her.
Just for an opinion.
In the meantime, can you think of the names of any persons... who would have a motive to murder this woman?
You see, it doesn't seem to me to be a simple case of an interrupted break-in... or, say, a rape-murder.
Juliana had a long series of lovers.
I never met any of them.
What about her husband?
His name is Barton Kelly.
He works for the government, out in Halifax.
They were divorced over 10 years ago.
- Dr. Birkin.
- You must be Candice's father.
I'd like to take her home now.
Please. Give me just two minutes with you.
It's important. Have a seat.
To put it bluntly, I don't think your daughter escaped this incident entirely unscathed.
- You think she saw what happened?
- I suspect she did.
Or she saw something which traumatized her, confused her... disturbed her in some way.
The officer who found her said that she was very difficult to wake up.
To me, that indicates a kind of abnormal deep sleep... which a lot of people, even children, will use... to escape something that's too painful to face.
And she says that she doesn't remember being brought to her grandmother's... or seeing her at all.
Do you think she'll remember, eventually?
Mr. Carveth, I think you must encourage her to remember.
Why?
My concern is that the child could have a very serious breakdown... if she doesn't come to terms with what she's experienced.
You see, these things tend to express themselves in one way or another.
I've seen five-year-olds like her... with ulcers as bad as any middle-aged businessman.
Okay, I get the picture.
- Now can I take her home?
- I think that's fine.
No problem.
You're sure you don't want a story?
You don't have to read, you know.
I can make one up for you.
Do you want to tell me a story... about what happened today at Grandma's?
You go to sleep, honey.
I'll leave the hall light on.
Damn.
No outside calls. You're in isolation.
You know that.
I tried to reach Dr. Raglan. He hasn't come.
He's on his way.
Chris...
Is something wrong? Anything?
Then it's me again.
Nothing's wrong, except with me.
No, that's Frank talking,
Frank twisting my words.
He won't be patient, he won't trust me, he won't wait until I get well.
He thinks... that I'm turning into my mother.
Day by day, moment by moment, he thinks that I'm trying... to make Candy into Baby Nola.
Is he right?
No. That's the last thing on earth I'd...
Who's that?
It's Daddy.
Frank hates me, Daddy. He despises me.
He thinks I'm trying to harm my little girl... and I know that he's thinking of a way to take her away.
And that's very unfair of him.
That's very arrogant of him.
You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.
He's just trying to be a good, protective father.
No.
Yes.
He's just doing what a good father should do.
He's protecting his little girl.
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
He doesn't want to see her hurt.
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody, not even her own mother.
Now, is there anything wrong with that?
No.
No, there isn't.
After all, it's just what I did for you, isn't it?
Frank's protecting Candy the same way as I protected you, isn't he?
Isn't he?
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
- What do mean when you say "no"?
- I love you, Daddy.
I don't want you to think that I don't love you.
I mean, you didn't.
"Didn't"?
"Didn't" what?
You didn't protect me.
You didn't.
You didn't, and you should have.
You shouldn't have looked away when she hit me.
And you shouldn't have walked away from the table... when she twisted my words.
You should have stopped her.
You should have hit her when she hit me!
And you should have smacked her when she smacked me.
Oh, God, I love you.
But you didn't protect me.
And you should have.
You pretended it wasn't happening.
You looked away.
And you should have.
Why didn't you?
Didn't you love me?
Look, there he is.
There's your grandfather.
Barton.
Hello, Frank. How you doing?
Good to see you.
- Let me take that.
- Hello. How you doing, Candy?
I guess you don't remember your old granddad?
Right this way.
You didn't have to come way out here.
We could have met later, at the hotel.
I just didn't like the idea of you coming in alone.
How long you plan to stay in town?
I guess we could have the funeral tomorrow... but Juliana's parents might want to come in from Arizona.
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.
I don't know just how it's going to work out.
- All right. What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.
You know, I was even thinking about going out to that old house again.
I still have the key, after all these years.
Juliana used to make a big fuss about never having changed the locks.
I could never understand why.
Maybe it's because she really couldn't admit that we were finished.
When I think about you and Nola... and this sweet child having to go through the same heartaches we went through... it's enough to make you cry.
Yes, it is.
I'm here to see Mr. Jan Hartog.
Come in. Right in.
Sit down. I'll be right there.
Sit down. I'll be there in a second.
Goddamn son of a bitch.
Okay.
That's my... heart, over there on the floor.
- Your heart?
- My second heart.
Your first heart makes your blood circulate, right?
But what about your lymphatic fluids?
I don't know.
Movement, walking and running, fucking, rolling on the floor, anything.
People have this whole other system they don't even know about.
The lymphatic system, it's like the blood system... with its own style of veins and arteries... but no heart.
You have to keep moving to get it to circulate.
And they've just given me pills.
They do that every day.
And I've got to move them through the lymphatic system.
Goddamn it.
Pardon my sweat.
I'm gonna take a bath, real soon.
So, Mr. Carveth... how did you get my name?
My lawyer knows your lawyer.
I see. I get it.
Is your lawyer preparing a case against Raglan, too?
Basically, yes.
- Slightly different from yours.
- How different?
My wife is still in therapy with Raglan.
I'm claiming psychological damage, not physiological.
I see. Give him some more time with your wife... and you'll be able to claim physiological damage, too.
Wouldn't this look impressive in court?
Do you like it? I do.
That's Raglan. That's psychoplasmics... and it's called lymphosarcoma.
And it's spreading.
It's a form of cancer of the lymphatic system.
You blame Raglan for that?
Raglan did it.
Raglan encouraged my body... to revolt against me.
And it did.
I have a small revolution on my hands... and I'm not putting it down very successfully.
Then your lawyer really thinks he can prove Raglan's responsible?
Are you kidding me?
You can't prove something like that in court.
Right from square one, you're into, what, metaphysics?
How do you know
I'm not going to get cancer at age 32... whether I'd gone into psychoplasmics therapy or not?
No, we'd get laughed out of court.
Then why are you going into court?
Revenge.
Even if we lose, people will get nervous about psychoplasmics.
It will be bad publicity.
They won't even remember whether we won or lost.
They'll just remember the slogan:
"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."
Catchy.
Is that going to help?
Maybe.
I'm not alone.
I'm in touch with a lot of people who did psychoplasmics.
We might form a club.
I want to help you.
Okay. Thanks.
Dr. Raglan?
Yes?
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.
Glad to meet you.
I'm sorry to accost you like this... but your receptionist wasn't too helpful.
She probably knew I was on my way to...
Did you know that Nola's mother died yesterday?
That she was murdered?
Yes, the police spoke to me.
- Then you've told her.
- No, I haven't.
That's why I'm here, to tell her.
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death was a tragic and shocking thing.
That's why Nola must not be told.
What?
Nola's going through a very critical stage in her therapy.
I'm not sure she could take it.
Are you saying that
I'm just supposed to bury the girl's mother... and not tell her about it?
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
You are one ignorant son of a bitch,
Dr. Raglan.
Now, I have left my phone number... on your front desk.
If I don't hear from my daughter by tomorrow afternoon...
I'm coming back up here to get her.
Shall I have him stopped?
No, it's all right.
He's drunk.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- You two look like you're having fun.
- We were.
Daddy, Ms. Mayer said she was starving.
Can we feed her at our place tonight?
Candy...
We could if she wanted to.
What do you think?
Well, I...
We could talk after Candy goes to bed.
Sure.
As soon as Candy realized she had me alone... she got me to play
"mother and daughter" with her.
She obviously needs mothering, and isn't getting it.
Sometimes it just kills me to think
I might have screwed my kid up already.
She's not even six.
It's not just you.
Sometimes when I'm being easy on myself,
I say, "It's not your fault.
"You got taken in.
"You got involved with a woman who married you for your sanity...
"hoping it would rub off."
Instead, it started to work the other way.
Hello?
It's Barton Kelly, Frank.
How are you?
Just mediocre.
How are you?
I made a mistake.
I came back to the old place.
It's got me.
I'm depressed as hell.
Barton, get in a cab, will you?
- Just tell him to take...
- That's not all.
There's Nola, too.
How do you mean?
I went up to that place to see her.
They wouldn't even let me talk to her.
They said no to me, her own father!
Jesus.
So I'm going back up there, to Somafree.
We'll leave just as soon as you get here.
Soon as I get there?
I'll be waiting for you.
I know you'll want to go up there with me.
- You're not far from here, are you?
- Barton, listen to me.
I don't think that's a very smart thing to do.
I'm doing it, with or without you.
Okay.
I'm only about 15 minutes away. Wait for me.
I'll be there.
You're a good lad.
We'll go up there together, and kick their ass.
I'm waiting on you.
I've a feeling
I've just been recruited to baby-sit.
Would you? Lt'd take 45 minutes.
He's drunk.
He'll drive his car off a bridge, unless I talk some sense into him.
45 minutes?
That's all it'll take.
Okay.
Thanks.
Help yourself to some coffee.
Here.
Look at this while I'm gone.
If you like it, I'll give it to you.
45 minutes.
I shouldn't have...
I never planned it to be this way.
Nola?
Barton!
It's me!
I can't get over it.
The thing was in the house.
It was in the house all the time.
We searched the place... but we weren't looking for anything that small, and we missed it.
We were spending our time checking out an Estonian musician.
Have you found out who it belongs to, the kid?
No. My guess is... some crazy woman didn't want anyone to know she had a deformed child.
She's locked this kid up in an attic for years and never told anybody.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Hello.
Who's this?
Ruth Mayer.
Did you want to speak with Frank Carveth?
Ruth Mayer? From Krell Street School?
Yes.
Is this Mrs. Carveth?
Are you and my husband having your own private PTA meeting?
I won't even bother to answer that.
You bitch!
You're killing my family!
Our friend has very strange eyes.
They have irises, but no retinas.
I should think his vision of the world is very distorted.
I'm pretty certain he sees things only in black-and-white.
No colors.
The upper lip is cleft.
Real harelip... but the palate is not.
And the tongue is too thick and inflexible for proper speech.
It has no teeth... but you can get a pretty nasty bite...
from these strange, beak-like gums.
Why did it die?
I found some sort of collapsed, fleshy sac...
between the little fellow's shoulder blades.
It contains traces of a solid nutrient material... a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish... or a camel's hump.
Basically, it's a gas tank that was full at birth.
Once the hump material is completely assimilated...
I think the creature simply starves to death.
Runs out of gas, so to speak.
And that brings us to the last point of interest.
There's an external deformity.
I mean, apart from the lack of sexual organs.
It's extremely subtle and extremely provocative.
I wonder if either of you have noticed it.
- Has no navel.
- No what?
No bellybutton.
- The thing has no bellybutton.
- That's right.
And that means this creature has never really been born.
At least, not the way human beings are born.
Jesus.
You're the beginning of the end, Ms. Mayer.
The beginning of the end for me, my family, my dream.
So sad.
And I feel so guilty for my part in it.
I wish it had never happened.
I wish we could be together again, just the three of us.
You're kidding yourself.
Right now, you're dreaming.
From what Frank tells me, it was lousy from the very start.
You never had anything real together.
It would be better for everybody if you...
If Frank divorced you and married me.
We'd still let you see Candy in the weekends.
That stinks!
We had a lot.
We had beautiful things, things that you couldn't understand.
And we'll have them again, if you'd just leave him alone... and stop poisoning him against me and taking advantage of his loneliness.
Then he'd wait for me.
He'd help me to get better, instead of abandoning me.
He would do that, if you would just leave him alone.
Leave him alone!
Listen, I'm sorry. I called a few times.
You didn't answer.
I didn't want to talk to your wife again, that's why. Once was enough.
- Nola called? What did she say?
- Look, I have to go.
Your life is just a little too complicated for me right now.
I'll see you at the next open house.
Daddy.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Why aren't you sleeping?
I had a bad dream. A scary bad dream.
- What was the dream about, honey?
- I'm afraid to tell you.
- Why?
- The dream doesn't want me to.
Candy, listen to me.
I know what happened at Grandma's.
I know what you saw there.
I just came from the police... and when I was there,
I saw the thing that hurt Grandma.
And, Candy, it's dead.
I saw it lying on a table, and the police were there, and it's dead.
It can't hurt you now.
And it can't hurt me or anybody else.
Do you understand me?
It's dead?
Yes.
It's all right now, baby.
What do you think?
How many people do we have at the main house?
Twenty-seven.
Okay, I want them out by this afternoon... and the house closed.
It'll be hard on them, Hal, especially Mike.
Then do it gently.
But get them out.
All right.
- Put your suitcases in the compartment.
- I don't want to go.
You have to go.
Come on. I just want you to get on the bus...
You'll see the doctor.
I don't want to go.
- Don't make me leave.
- I'm not making you leave.
Just be a good boy and get on the bus, all right?
- Hi, Jan.
- Frank, hi.
Look, I think we've got ourselves a real live one.
Come on upstairs.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
Is this the guy from Chicago?
No. He's a local boy.
He lives a lot closer to home than you expected.
Mr. Carveth is here to see you.
Look who's here.
Nola's old man.
- The queen bee's favorite drone.
- Jeez, he's pretty far gone.
He'd be dynamite in court.
What did you mean when you said
Nola's the queen bee?
She's the queen bee, all right.
She's the star.
She's the one he's interested in, and the rest of us don't count anymore.
She doesn't even have to pay for it.
That's because she's the one who was born to prove... that "psychoplasmics is the ultimate therapeutic device."
That's the quote, isn't it?
Can you be my daddy?
He won't do it anymore.
And my real daddy won't do it.
And that bastard, Dr. Raglan, won't do it anymore.
You see, my real daddy rejected me.
And my surrogate daddy rejected me.
That's just fucking wonderful, don't you think?
Calm down, Mike. Cool it, and tell him what happened at Somafree.
Look...
I'll make a deal with you, okay?
Just be my daddy.
Please. I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I'll bleed for you. Want me to bleed?
No.
That's silly, right?
Repulses you, I can see that.
You're not into it, so why do it, right?
Besides, nobody could do it like Dr. Raglan.
Not even real daddy.
And he knows it.
Dr. Raglan knows I'm addicted to him... and he doesn't care.
He's such a hard man.
I was at that demonstration last Monday.
You and Raglan seemed very close.
What happened?
He threw us out. All of us.
Locked the door.
It's true.
I've been in touch with some of the others.
They've all been thrown out of Somafree, and all therapy suspended.
All except for your wife. She's still there.
Doesn't anybody know why?
Sure somebody knows. I know.
He wants to be alone with her.
Dr. Raglan wants to be alone with your wife.
- 'Bye, Daddy.
- 'Bye.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Wendy.
Quickly but quietly, children.
Rebecca, do you want to pass out the blue papers, please?
And Clayton, how about you pass out the purple ones?
Okay, let's see.
This person here?
You can do snowflakes, too.
That's a good idea.
Help!
- What's the matter?
- They're hurting Ms. Mayer.
The bad kids are hurting Ms. Mayer.
They knocked her to the floor and they're hitting her.
They're hitting Ms. Mayer.
They made her fall down!
Candy!
It's all right. It's Hal.
Where's Chris? Chris usually wakes me up.
Chris had to go into the city.
You've been dreaming?
Yes. I was having a wonderful dream.
Wonderful.
And painful, at the same time.
My daughter was coming back to me.
And Frank.
And Ruth Mayer?
Was she in your dream?
Candy's teacher?
I don't remember.
Then maybe we should talk about her.
But I don't feel the need to talk about her.
You don't?
Why not?
I don't know.
I think I must be getting stronger, because somehow...
I just don't feel threatened by her anymore.
This is where my wife and kid lived for nine months... before Nola moved out to Somafree.
This is the first time I've seen the place.
What are we doing here?
Tell me, again.
I don't know.
I thought Candy might come back here.
It's not a coincidence.
Those things, those creatures... they all disappeared together.
They've got her.
You've got to help me.
Somebody's following me.
- Somebody's always following me.
- Did you find out anything?
- Did you find out why they moved you out?
- I've got to have something to eat. Anything.
What did you find out?
Why did they close Somafree down?
- Talk to me! Now!
- Okay.
Raglan's onto something very big, something to do with the kids.
- He just got bored with the rest of us.
- Kids? What kids?
The disturbed kids in the work shed... the ones your wife's taking care of.
What have you done with my kid?
Where is she?
Carveth, what the hell are you talking about?
They took her.
They killed Ruth Mayer, and then they brought Candice back here.
They killed Ruth Mayer?
I want my daughter back, now.
Did they bring her back here, back to Nola?
I don't know.
If they brought her back here, then she'd be up there, in the attic.
That's where they live.
Frank, I've got a gun.
They'll kill you if you try to take her away from them.
Why?
Because they understand that she's one of them.
You're insane.
Frank, they exist. You've seen them.
They're just freaks. Deformed children.
You've got Nola taking care of them.
I'm sure she loves being their surrogate mother.
She's not their surrogate mother.
She's their real mother.
Their only mother.
- I'm not gonna listen.
- They're her children.
More exactly, they're the children of her rage.
They're motivated only by her anger, whether that anger... is conscious or subconscious.
I mean, when Nola got cross with Candy last weekend... annoyed, really... the brood beat her.
But when she released her rage against her parents, under therapy... then they killed them.
I know, I didn't want to believe that... but now they've killed Ruth Mayer... and they could kill you or me, and she wouldn't even be aware of it.
I mean, she doesn't even know that Candy's here.
- I want Candice back.
- Then do it my way.
Please.
It's the right way.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to go back into that hut... and persuade Nola that you want her back... that you want your family back.
I want you to play the role of apologetic lover and husband.
Why?
Because if you can keep Nola calm and happy... then the brood's neutral.
If she's mellow, then I can just walk into that attic... pick up Candy, tuck her under my arm and walk out.
Now, can you do that?
I don't know.
Frank, if things go wrong... if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry...
You understand?
I'm not going to be the only one to pay for that anger.
Raglan, I don't trust you.
What does it matter?
I'll move up there 30 seconds after you're in.
Frank, be nice to her.
Hal?
It's me, Nola. It's Frank.
Am I dreaming?
I thought you said you weren't going to come and see me while I was here.
I think that was a misunderstanding.
That's why I'm here.
I want us to understand each other.
You're the only woman in the world for me.
You always have been, you always will be.
It won't ever change.
I want you to know that.
I wish it were true. God, I wish it were true.
We lost touch.
That's the only reason all this ever happened.
All we have to do is make sure we don't lose touch again.
Isolation is part of my therapy.
What's been happening to me has been just too strange... too strange for me to share with anyone from my old life.
Then make me a part of your new life.
Let me be part of it.
Show me, educate me, involve me.
I'm ready now.
I wasn't before, but I'm ready now.
Candy?
Are you ready for me, Frank?
Are you really?
I seem to be a very special person.
I'm in the middle of a strange adventure.
Let me be with you.
I want to go with you wherever you go.
Do you?
Do you?
Yes.
Then look.
Daddy?
Is it time to go to school yet?
No, sweetheart.
It's Dr. Hal.
And Daddy's downstairs talking to Mommy.
He wants to see you.
Oh, God, Nola.
No, I disgust you.
I sicken you.
You hate me.
You didn't come here because you love me.
You came here to take our daughter away and give her to somebody else.
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that to you.
You go out of that door.
You find your daddy.
You liar. You're lying.
You're lying! I know!
I know you so well, and it won't work.
I'd kill Candice before I let you take her away from me.
Do you hear me?
I'd kill Candice before I let you take her!
Make them stop.
They're doing what you want them to do.
You want them to kill Candice.
You make them stop, or I'll kill you.
Kill me.
We're going home, Candy.
We're going home.

We've reserved three of the best seats for you and for General Enders, right next to Vice President.
Is he here yet?
No, sir, he's due any moment.
Asshole probably thinks they'll delay the launch for him.
Someone should tell him this is not a bridge opening.
I hope you and Mrs. Peaker will be very comfortable.
The Agency would like you to have these commemorative binoculars to help you watch the launch and to remember this day.
That's very nice. Look, Emily.
They have the date,
Capricorn One emblem in gold.
- Very nice, Hollis.
- I'm glad you like them.
Well, we'll need another pair for my wife.
I, I beg your pardon, sir?
Oh, don't make a fuss, Hollis, it's all right.
I said, 'we'll need another pair for my wife.'
- It's really not necessary.
- Here, Emily, take mine.
- I really won't need them.
- No, I don't...
Congressman Peaker, there's only a limited...
I didn't quite hear what you said.
Would you mind repeating it, please?
Oh, there's no problem.
I'll get another pair right away.
Very thoughtful of you.

Hollis, how are you?
Very well, Mr. Vice President.

Roger, Houston, we read nominal A.L.C.S.
Roger, Capitain.
We're at T minus 30 secs.
At the present time, all systems are go. All lights are green.
Gentlemen, we're going to be a little while.
You and your men might be more comfortable in these.
We're at T minus 18 secs. from lift-off.
We're T minus 15 secs.
T minus 10 secs., nine, eight
- we have ignition-
six, five -we have outboard engines-
three -we have inboard engines- one, zero.
We have a launch commit. We have a lift-off at 35 mins. after the hour.
Roger. We are starting yaw.
Roger, roll program complete.
Vehicles on targets and running smoothly.
Looking good, Capricorn.
We're coming up on Tplus 40 secs.
Staging should be in the next

Altitude: 43 miles.
Velocity: 6.100 miles per hour.
Mr. Vice President, please, give my regards to the President.
Oh, yes, I'll be very happy to do that, Hollis.
I, uh, hope that whatever problems he found so important not to be here today,
I hope he has considerable success with them.
Well, that's really very sporting of you.
I'm sure the President will be very pleased to learn of your support.
The President would get considerable more of my humble support if he would only be a little more helpful with this program here.
Now, Hollis, you know the President is most interested in this program.
I am most interested in a lot of things, including my wife's bridge game.
That is not the same as supporting something.
Hollis, there are many people who feel that we have problems here, on Earth that merit our attention before we spent billions of dollars on outer space.
There are a number of people who feel there are no more pressing problems than our declining position in world leadership.
It was wonderful seeing you again,
Hollis.
The pleasure was all mine,
Mr. Vice President.
This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.
You're at Tplus 2 hrs. 16 mins. into the flight.
The spacecraft is now in elliptical orbit
with an apogee of
- 141 nautical miles
and a perigee of 122 nautical miles.
Mission Control reports full voice contact with the flight crew.
This is Capricorn Control.
Welcome, Colonel.
Would you please come with us?
I'm not going anywhere till somebody tells us what the hell's going on.
- Everything will be explained to you.
- Bullshit, I wanna know right now!
Colonel, I know this sounds strange, we are all working for the same thing.
We are not your enemy.
Please, wait here.
I suppose you're wondering why I called you up here.
Good morning.
Hi there, Dr. Kelloway, nice to see you.
A funny thing happened on the way to Mars.
Well, why don't you all sit down?
Well.
Okay, here it is.
I have to start by saying that if there was any other way, if there was even a slight chance of another alternative,
I would give anything not to be here with you now, anything.
Bru, how long have we known each other?
Sixteen years, that's how long, sixteen years.
You should have seen yourself then.
You seemed walked out of a Wheaties box.
And me, all sweaty palmed and deadly serious.
I told everybody about this dream I had of conquering the New Frontier and they all looked at me like I was nuts.
You looked at me and said, "yes".
I remember when you told me
Kay was pregnant.
We even went out and got crocked.
I remember when Charles was born.
We went out and got crocked again.
The two of us, Captain Terrific and the Mad Doctor talking about reaching the stars and the bartender telling us maybe we'd had enough.
Sixteen years.
And then, Armstrong, stepped out on the Moon and we cried. We were so proud.
Willis, you and Walker, you came in about then, both bright and talented.
Looked at me in my wash and wear shirt, carrying on this hot love affair with my slide rule and even you were caught up in what we'd done.
I remember when Glenn made his first orbit in Mercury.
They put up television sets in
Grand Central Station, and tens of thousands of people missed their trains to watch.
You know, when Apollo Seventeen landed on the Moon, people were callin' up the networks and bitchin' because reruns of I Love Lucy were cancelled.
Reruns, for Chrissake!
I can understand if it was the new Lucy Show.
I mean, what the hell is a walk on the Moon?
But reruns?
Oh, Jesus!
And then, suddenly, everybody started talking about how much everything cost.
Was it really worth twenty billion to go to another planet?
What about cancer? What about the slums? How much does it cost?
How much does any dream cost?
For Chrissake!
Since when is there an accountant for ideas?
You know who was at the launch today?
Not the President, the Vice President, that's who.
The Vice President and his plump wife.
The President was busy.
He's not busy.
He's just a little bit scared.
He sat there two months ago and put his feet up on Woodrow
Wilson desk.
And he said, "Jim... make it good.
Congress is on my back.
They're looking for a reason to cancel the program.
We can't afford another screw-up!
Make it good!
You have my every good wish."
His every good wish. I got his sanctimonious Vice President, that's what I got!
And so there we are, after all those hopes and all that dreaming.
He sits there with those flags behind his chair and tells we can't afford a screw-up.
And guess what?
We had a screw-up.
A first-class, bonafide, made-in-America screw-up!
The nice people from Con-Amalgamate delivered a life-support system cheap enough so they could make a profit on the deal.
Works out fine for everybody.
Con-Amalgamate makes money, we have our life-support system, everything is peachy!
Except they made a little bit too much profit.
We found out two months ago, it won't work.
You guys would all be dead in three weeks. It's as simple as that.
So all I have to do is report that and scrub the mission.
Congress has its excuse, the President still has his desk and we have no more program.
What's sixteen years?
An actual drop in the bucket!
All right, that's the end of the speech.
Now, we're getting to what they call the moment of the truth.
Come with me,
I wanna show you something.
Roger, Houston. TMI burn time will be 5 mins. 45 secs.
Roger, Capricorn.
Delta vapor burn time 3.3 secs.
There's a door here. I'm gonna open it and walk into another area.
If you follow me, you'll see a bit more.
I'll answer some questions and... and we're going to...
Why don't you just follow me?
You don't really think you're gonna get away with this?
Well, I don't know, it's a chance.
Maybe it's not a very good one, but it's a chance.
- Who knows about this?
- Almost nobody.
Houston is monitoring the actual flight.
All the telemetry is coming from the Command Module, so are your voices and medical data.
We recorded everything from the practice simulations.
They don't know.
All we need from you is the actual television transmissions durnig the flight and the Mars landing, that's all.
Just the television transmissions.
That's all?
Just the television transmissions.
We inserted a change in the onboard computer, so the spacecraft will land two hundred miles off target when it returns to Earth.
You'll be flown to an island near that point.
From there you'll be transferred to a helicopter.
The helicopter will fly you to the space capsule and you'll be put inside.
It'll take the Recovery Forces a minimum of an hour and a half to reach the splashdown site.
By then, you'll be inside the capsule.
When the prime recovery carrier arrives, they'll find you inside the capsule and take you out of the spacecraft.
You've thought of everything.
I don't know. I hope so.
Of course, you're sure we'll go along, right?
No, I'm not.
What if we say no?
I don't know.
Don't say no.
When does Allen Funt come running in and tell us we're on Candid Camera?
Jesus! You think I like this?
You think I really believe I'm standing here in this craziness telling you about patching and tape recordings and telemetry and an island two hundred miles from the target zone?
I don't, I don't know what the hell
I'm doing, either!
I just case so Goddamn much,
I think it's worth it.
I'm not even sure of that.
I just think it.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Well, that'll solve everything.
Well, what's this all gonna solve?
It'll keep something alive that shouldn't die!
Before you all begin to moralize, you take a look around.
You look at what we've done and how much more we can do.
You look at what we've meant to this country.
Nobody gives a crap about anything any more.
People close their garages, and triple lock their doors, they hide under the beds, they even, they're even afraid to turn on their television sets for fear of what they might find out in the evening news.
There's nothing more to believe in.
Now, you wanna blow this whole thing wide open?
God knows what it might do to everybody.
I'm sorry. I'm so Goddamn sorry.
I just don't know what else to do.
I'm hanging on by my fingernails, just like everybody else.
Go on, you, you wanna be the ones who give everyone another reason to give up?
Go on!
This is really wonderful.
We go along with you and lie our asses off, and the world of truth and ideals is... protected.
But we don't wanna take part in some giant ripe-off of yours and some how or other we're managing to ruin the country.
You're pretty good, Jim.
I'll give you that.
Now, now, now, you're twisting my words.
- Don't sell yourself short!
- Don't sell the program short!
Don't oversell it. I'm not so sure that cancelling a flight or cutting off appropriations means America folds up.
It's not as simple as that and you know it!
I don't know it.
If the only way to keep something alive is to become everything I hate,
I don't know if it's worth keeping it alive.
Please, Bru, don't talk like that.
What the hell's the matter with you,
'Please, Bru, don't talk like that? '
I don't think this is right!
All the rest is bullshit!
You have to help!
- What do you mean I have to?
- You have to help!
And what if I don't?
Please, don't put me in a corner.
You're crazy.
You know that? You are crazy! You've got us in the middle of this nuthouse!
And you don't wanna be put in a corner?
Your families!
- What about our families?
- Please, you have to help!
- What about our families?
- You have to help!
Shit, this thing is outta my hands!
You think it's all a couple of looney scientists?
It's not! It's bigger!
There are people out there, forces out there, who have a lot to lose!
They are grown-ups!
It's gotten too big!
It's in the hands of grown-ups!
What about our families?
They are flying back from the Cape to
Houston! They are all on the plane!
Naw, you're not serious.
- Please, Bru, don't make me!
- You son-of-a-bitch, tell me!
They're on the plane together!
You want it in writing?
There's a device! It's on the plane!
There's some people...! If I don't give the 'all clear' signal they'll explode it!
Don't you understand?
It doesn't have to be like this!
You have to help!
It's gotten outta control! It's too big!
You wouldn't.
Tell me you wouldn't.
I, I can't tell you that, Bru.
This coffee is horrible.
- It's not that bad.
- It is. It's that bad.
Don't drink it.
I'm always unwrapping things.
I wake up and take the cellophane off the drink glass.
The soaps in the Holiday Inn wrapper, even the toilet has a paper band on it with a nice little note from the hotel saying they put the band on the toilet for my protection.
I'm afraid that if I stay in bed too long, the maid walks in the room and surround me and the breadspread with a paper band.
I don't mind.
You wait. After a while you won't know what city you are in.
I defy anyone to tell me the difference between the Holiday Inn in Houston and the Holiday Inn in Cincinnati.
The rooms are the same.
The music in the elevators is the same, even the ladies with too much makeup in the coffee shop are the same.
You never know where you are until after breakfast,
- when you read the paper.
- I don't mind it.
Well, I don't mind it that much, either.
It's just that I would like it all to be with someone I care for, someone I could share it with.
- Bullshit.
- You're so damn cynical.
I'm not cynical. It's just that your act could use a little polish.
- What do you mean by that?
- Liz Haller, for starter.
It was at the California Primary?
I believe you used the one about both witnessing to the unfolding of history.
You've got to admit it's better than soap wrappers.
You think all I wanna do is jump you.
Yes.
You wouldn't know sincerity if it ran over you.
- Not if you were driving it.
- I'm glad I'm not like you.
I have better legs.
Okay, I give up.
Don't give up so easily, just change your approach.
What approach would you like?
How about something like, uh,
'I would like to jump you'?
Think that would work?
It has more chance than wanting to share a life together.
- I would like to jump you.
- Go jump yourself.
I'm sorry that you had to wait outside the house all day like this.
There is not much that I can say except that
I'm very excited and proud.
Everything seems to be going smoothly.
Dr. Kelloway called to say that Bru and the crew were in excellent spirits.
How has all this disrupted your family routine?
- Terrific question.
- Shove it!
Well, the children will continue to go to school and we'll try to maintain a normal existence.
I suppose that's all that I have to say.
Thank you all for coming.
Uh, I just came out to say hello and go back inside now.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Dr. Bergen?
- Yes, Elliot?
- I wonder if I could talk to you
- for a moment.
- What is it?
Well, there's somethin'...
I have a problem, sir.
- Oh, are you feeling all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. It's the readout.
What about the readout?
Well, I, I just can't figure something out.
- Well, perhaps I can be of some help.
- Well, I hope so.
See, I ran a check on the transmission, on my own on the signals.
- On your own?
- Yes, sir.
- I like your dedication.
- The readout...
The television signals are coming in ahead of the spacecraft signals.
It's like they're closer or something.
Oh, that's not possible. There must be some malfunction in your equipment.
Well, I don't think so, Dr. Bergen. You see, I doubled checked that console.
- Which console are you on?
- Thirty-six, sir.
Well, that's the answer.
We've been having problems with the circuitry on thirty-six.
We've had trouble with it before.
I'll make sure it's repaired and, thank you for showing me the problem.
You have initiative, I like that.
This is Paul Cunningham.
Capricorn Control.
We are at Tplus one 131 days
- 4 hrs. 15 mins. into the flight.
5 mins. from landing.
The wives of the flight crew arrived at Mission
Control at 2.31 Eastern
Daylight Time.
In just a few minutes
we should be receiving a signal from the spacecraft.
It's important to know that it takes
- 21 mins. for the signal
from Mars to reach Earth.
We have no way of communicating with Capricorn One
and what we will see actually happened 21 mins. ago.
This is Capricorn Control.
We're getting something now.
We are changing to a secondary frequency.
Houston, this is Capricorn One.
CM-LM separation was normal.
I have CM visual contact through port window.
Delta-Vburn time: 3.3 secs.
3.3 secs. Burn is correct.
We should be hearing from the CM... soon.
- Houston, this is Capricorn CM.
- Just wait.
I see the LM.
5 mins. after the landing, that asshole Price'll be callin' to tell me how pleased the President is.
If our data is correct, their altitude is 2.2 miles, pitch angle, 20 degrees.
Vertical descent 44.6 feet per second.
We have passed Low Gate.
Altitude: 950 feet. Looking good.
- 15 secs.
- 15 secs.
10 secs.
10 secs.
Nine...
eight...
seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
two...
one...
zero.
Houston, this is Capricorn One.
We have landed.
- Yes?
- Vice President Price on the line.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Vice President.
Yes, it's wonderful, isn't it?
Proud moment for all Americans.
You can tell the President that's very gracious of him.
I appreciate it, I really do.
Thank you.
And my very best to your lovely wife.
Yes.
Goodbye.
Asshole.
Dr., I wonder if I can speak to you for a moment.
Certainly, what seems to be the problem?
Well, I just can't figure something out, sir.
What is that?
Well, I'm not exactly sure, but it's the readout.
I told Dr. Bergen about it a long time and he said it was in the console.
I'd like you to take a look at it.
- Well, what console are you on?
- Telemetry, sir, thirty-six.
Oh, yes, Dr. Bergen told me about that.
We had that console repaired.
I know, sir, it's just...
I keep on having the same readouts.
Well, what readout?
Well, sir, I ran a program on my own just to check something and the readout is different.
You ran your own program?
Yes, sir, and...
I don't think it's the console.
Well, we'll have it shut down and
I'll see that it's serviced.
Thank you, Elliot, for bringing the matter to my attention.
You're welcome, sir.
This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.
The Flight Director advises that the LM crew has been given a Go
for the first DVA on the Martian surface.
Because the time delay would make a conversation impossible,
the crew has taken a prerecorded message from the President with them.
This is Capricorn Control.
Houston, we're activating the camera.
Roger, Capricorn.
Houston, you should have a picture now.
- We have a pretty good picture now.
- Houston, I am outta the hatch.
I am on the ladder.
Houston, the suit is functional.
The ladder is steady.
I am three steps from the bottom.
I'm two steps from the bottom.
Houston, I'm on the bottom step.
Houston, I am gonna set foot on the surface.
Ready slow-mo.
I take this step
in the journey of peace
for all mankind.
Take slow-mo!
Houston, I am on the surface.
Roger, Capricorn. We copy.
I am starting to walk now.
Houston, the surface is solid.
Visibility is good.
I'm walking toward the camera now.
The footing is solid.
Surface seems powdery.
I am picking up the camera now.
I have the camera.
The picture will get shaky for a while.
The footing is good.
Houston, I am setting the camera down now.
The rocks seem very porous.
Houston, I am outside the hatch.
Houston, I am on the ladder.
Ready slow-mo.
Houston, I'm stepping onto the surface
Take slow-mo!
Houston, I am on the surface.
We are going to set the flag on the surface.
We do not claim this planet in the name of America.
We claim it in the name of all the the people of the planet Earth.
We hope that our visit will increase the understanding
of the human race.
Walker should be activating the tape soon with the prerecorded message from the President.
Houston, I am starting the tape.
"To the men of Capricorn One.
I bring you greetings from your fellow Americans
and all the citizens of the world."
You are so far away.
It takes light more than 20 min.
To reach you from here.
One could say not only light,
one could say time.
You are in another time from us,
the future.
We will never be the same,
for this moment
more than any moment in our history,
has made all of the people in the world realize
that we are part of the planet,
that is part of the system,
that is part of the Universe.
We are a small energetic species,
capable of pettiness, yet capable of brilliance.
We know how bad we can be,
now you, the men of Capricorn One,
have shown us how wonderful we can be
by showing us how high we can reach.
You have crossed the last great frontier
and you have shown us what we are:
People.
Of different colors and religions and ideologies,
however, a single people.
You are the basic truth in us.
You are the reality.
We will never let you down
and we will always be grateful."
I have decided after a careful deliberation and a painful soul-searching to give you an opportunity
- to win your 50 dollars back.
- I don't feel like playing.
- Eight ball, five dollars a game.
- I don't feel like it.
- 10 dollars.
- I'm serious.
So am I. I'll even let you break.
Can a person be more serious?
You're drunk.
I knew there was a reason
I was feeling this good.
I need a drink.
Underneath that wash and wear shirt, you have some heart.
It may be sanforized, but it's a heart.
Mike?
- You said I break.
- I must'a' been drunk.
- Hard day at the office, dear?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Did you break your slide rule?
- I'm not really sure.
I ran a check on my own transmissions signals.
The numbers came up screwy, so I told Dr. Bergen about it.
It was like he was pissed at me for running a check.
He said it must be a console malfunctioning.
So I told Dr. Kelloway about it and he said the same thing.
Big deal. What did you expect, a merit badge?
I guess so.
They must know what they're doing.
Those numbers couldn't have been right anyway. No way.
If you know the numbers couldn't have been right, why are you so upset?
It was the way they reacted.
No double check or anything.
They looked at me like I was a kid and offered me a cookie.
- What were the numbers?
- I have to admit it is ridiculous.
Good, let's play pool.
Those signals couldn't have come from 300 miles.
Which signals?
The television transmission.
I think I just sobered up. Would you tell me what you just told me again?
Hey, Caulfield, telephone.
Hello?
Yes, this is Caulfield.
What?
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak more clearly.
I think we have a bad connection or something. I can't hear you.
Who?
I don't understand what you want.
Look, if you call the assignment desk, they'll be glad to send someone over to cover that for you.
Yes, ask for the assignment desk.
Assignment. That's right.
You're welcome.
Anybody hungry?
No.
Oh, the marvels of american science.
Here we are, millions of miles from the Earth and we can still send out for a pizza.
I'm not gonna do it.
Not gonna do what?
Tomorrow, I'm not gonna sit in this thing and talk to my wife and tell her everything is going fine.
I'm not gonna do it.
I tried.
I got two little kids with big bright eyes.
And I used to tell them their daddy was gonna make them proud of him like he was of them.
And now I gotta go home,
I gotta kiss them and gotta look in their eyes and tell them I really did this?
I don't know. Maybe that's better that telling them I really didn't do it.
I wish I knew what was right.
I really don't.
We've been sitting around here for months, telling their lies for them.
And I don't wanna do it any more.
Okay, so we go and blow the whole thing tomorrow, on national TV,
then what have we done?
- We'd screw up a lotta people's dinner.
- We've already screwed ourselves.
Okay, so what do we accomplish by screwing everybody else?
He's got a point there, you know.
We went along with this for you.
You and our families.
Now you wanna go out in some terrific blaze of glory?
And we get pulverized in the process?
And our families?
- What about our families?
- I know!
I know.
Shit!
That's the best thing I've heard anybody say in three weeks.
- What's the best thing?
- Shit.
I just don't think I can do it.
Get me Dr. Kelloway.
Why, all of a sudden, are we standing up for the bad guys and you're on the side of truth and justice?
We may have a problem with
Brubaker tomorrow.
- I wish I had the words.
- Damn the words, Bru!
These people... they're capable of anything.
And we got our families out there.
Now, we're in this thing and I think we're in too deep to stop now.
No one os us is gonna decide.
It's got to be all of us.
Operator, I'm trying a number now for over an hour and it's busy.
Would you kindly check to see if it's out of order?
I know you don't do that.
Yes, it's an emergency.
Thank you. 8733657.
No, 3657, Mr. Elliot Whitter.
Out of order?
Thank you very much, operator.
This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.
We are a Tplus 223 days
- 6 hrs. 32 mins.
All systems are go.
All lights are green.
We are awaiting the start of the final television transmissions
from the Command Module on its return to Earth.
This is specifically a conversation between the crew and their wives.
This is the first time the crew has been close enough to Earth
to make normal conversation feasible.
This is Capricorn Control.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Roger, Houston, this is Capricorn One.
Houston, do you have a picture?
Roger, Capricorn, we have a picture.
We have three anxious ladies here who would like to talk to you.
Roger, Houston.
We'd sure like to talk to them.
Okay, go ahead, but keep it short.
Remember, this is long distance.
Jack?
Jack, it's Betty.
- Hey, Betty, how are you?
- You look fine.
Thanks. You know we can't see you up here, but you sure sound terrific.
I miss you. So do the kids.
Okay, I miss them too, more than you all know.
Peter?
It's Sharon.
I told you never to call me here.
Are you feeling well?
I'm feeling very well.
How's Sandy?
Well, she's got the part of Wendy in her school play.
They're doing Peter Pan.
That's terrific.
You sound so close.
It's hard to believe you really are that far away in space.
It's hard for me to believe it, too.
Bru?
Hello, Kay.
We're all so proud of you.
Can you hear me, Bru?
Yes.
- I'm not sure of Brubaker.
- Keep watching.
Bru? I have a surprise for you.
What?
I said I have a surprise for you.
What is it?
Charles wrote a composition in school and he won an award.
May I read it to you?
Bru, can you hear me?
Yes...
please, read it to me.
It doesn't look good.
Do I cut the transmission?
Not until I tell you.
'My father, by Charles Brubaker, Jr.'
'My father is far away from me now.
He is flying to Mars.
I miss him very much.
I always miss him when he goes away.
I'm not sad, though.
I used to be sad when he went away.
One day he told me that people can't live only for themselves.
He said he was trying to do something that would be good for everybody.
I know that is what he is doing now.
He is doing something for everybody, to give them a better life.
That means he is doing something for me, too.
So even though he is far away, he is thinking about me and I am with him.
That is why I'm not sad.
That is why I'm so proud of my Dad.
I love him so much.'
Kay.
What is it?
There's something I...
I wanna say.
Bru?
What is it?
Not until I tell you.
I know this hasn't been easy for you and the kids.
I want you to know
I love you.
Tell Charles thanks for the composition, please.
I will.
Tell him when I get back,
I'm gonna take him to Yosemite again, like last summer.
I will.
And I want you to know that I love you.
Very much.
Time's up, gentlemen.
Roger, Houston.
The next time we see you, you'll be on the way home.
- Roger.
- Well done, Capricorn.
Yes?
Is Whitter in?
Tell him it's Caulfield.
- Who?
- Whitter. Elliot Whitter.
There's no one here by that name.
You must have the wrong apartment.
Well, this is apartment 228, isn't it?
Yeah. Oh, you probably have the wrong building.
You know, they are all sorta look alike.
Yeah, that's right.
This is 4311 Claridge, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
Elliot Whitter lives at 4311 Claridge, in apartment 228.
Is this a joke?
Look, I've been here a million times.
Elliot's a friend of mine and he lives in this apartment!
Look, Mister..., whoever you are.
I'm cleaning an oven.
It's my oven. It's in my kitchen.
In my apartment.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to it.
Wait a minute! Just wait! Look, I'm not a crazy person and I'm not a mugger!
I'm looking for my friend and he lives in this apartment! I swear it!
Would you get your foot out of my door or I'm gonna call the police!
Now I don't think this is funny any more!
Wait. I can prove I've been here before.
I know this apartment.
Now, will you get outta here, or do I have to call the police?
This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.
We are 259 days 14 hrs. 12 mins. into the flight.
All systems are normal.
All lights are green.
The prime recovery ship, the U.S.S. Oriskany, is in position.
An on-target landing should result in recovery time
of 18 mins. from splash-down to the opening of the hatch.
After the crew delivers its speech on the Oriskany deck
and is welcomed aboard by Captain Earl Marks,
they'll be taken below deck for a medical debriefing.
Tonight, at 8 o'clock
Pacific Daylight Time,
the crew will attend the victory banquet topped by a special dessert,
a 40 feet red cake, depicting the Martian surface.
We are 23 mins. 12 secs. from the beginning of the re-entry phase.
This is Capricorn Control.
We have a chopper waiting on the island to take you to the spacecraft when it splashes down.
It'll take the Oriskany about 1.30 hr. To reach you, so there won't be any rush.
All lights are green.
Roger. All green.
Separation thruster check list?
De propulsor?
Separation thruster check list.
Outboard thrusters.
Outboard thrusters on.
Inboard thrusters.
- Inboard thrusters on.
- How we doin'?
We might have a slight problem, sir.
- What is it?
- They're a little bit off target.
How far off?
- As much as 200 miles.
- That far?
It could take up to 1.30 hr. For the recovery forces to reach them.
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.
Six... five... four... three... two...
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, we show red on the heat shield.
Do you copy?
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
We show red on the heat shield.
Do you read?
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
We show red on the heat shield.

Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, we show red on the heat shield. Do you copy?
- Capricorn One...
- That is, Kelloway.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Do you read?
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, we show red on the heat shield. Do you copy?
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

Capricorn, we show red light on the heat shield. Do you copy?
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.
We are advised that there appears to be a malfunction.
We do not know what the problem is. We will keep you advised.
This is Capricorn Control.
Charles, take Sandy and go inside.
- Mom, what's...
- Charles, go inside now!
- Mom...
- Charles, I said right now!
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief statement and then I will answer your questions.
It must have been re-entry.
Something went wrong during re-entry.
Why haven't they told us anything?
They don't want us to know what went wrong.
What went wrong?
- Whe the hell is Kelloway?
- Where the hell are we?
At Tplus 259 days 15 hrs. 11 mins. in the flight of Capricorn One, which is 2 mins. 18 secs. after interface, the heat shield light on the Mission
Control monitoring panel turned red.
We... are dead.
- What?
- We're dead.
Shit, I was such a terrific guy!
We tried to establish radio contract, contact with the spacecraft an we were unsuccessful.
It landed off course.
Why haven't they said anything to us?
And if it never landed, either the heat shield separated or the chutes never opened.
Either way, we are dead.
The heat shield evidently separated from the Command Module and, as you know, the heat shield is the only protection the Module has against the heat build-up on the re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
The spacecraft disintegrated within 12 secs. after the loss of the heat shield.
Right now Kelloway is making a speech about what brave, wonderful guys... we were.
I cannot adequately describe how we feel.
These men were an integral of the family... here in the program.
If anybody ever sees us again, the whole thing falls apart.
It's as simple as that.
They can't have us around.
That is the end of my statement.
- Have you spoken to the families?
- Yes.
I don't know how we have a lotta choice in this matter.
I say we get the hell outta here.
Anybody disagree?
When was the last time the heat shield was checked?
All during the re-entry phase there were a series of status checks.
All of them gave us every indication the shield was in place.
No, I have not spoken to the President yet, but I'm sure I will very soon.
I'd like to say that the President has been a constant source of encouragement to all of us in the program.
This mission meant as much to him as it did to us.
Do you think this will end the Manned Space Program?
I don't know.
You can't reach that far without stumbling somewhere along the way.
That doesn't mean that your goal isn't worthwhile.
So many people have given so much.
In 1967 we had the Apollo One fire.
But we didn't just... give up even though we were crushed.
We went on as they would have wanted us to.
Now, these three remarkable men have given their lives in an effort to... widen the horizons of their species.
They died striving for a goal.
You tell me.
I ask you... I ask all of you here.
You be the ones to tell me.
How could we best serve these men?
By giving up on their dream?
By saying that
it was all for nothing?
You give me the answer.
- That was the left gear we lost.
- See if you can retract the other one.
- Do you have any idea where we are?
- No.
Which direction are we headed?
West. Once we hit the coast, we'll go North.
All we've got to do is get to any city, any place there are people, a newspaper, a television station.
Any place we can show up and be seen. Then it's over.
I'm not sure it's exactly over.
Our families, our kids.
They think we're dead.
I wonder, when we show up, when everybody finds up,
I wonder if they'll be happy.
Maybe it'd be better for them if we were dead.
Oh, Christ!
Fuel! There's no Goddamn fuel!
I told you never to take a trip without checking the tank.
- What about the reserve?
- We're on reserve.
That's great.
I'll start to circle.
See if you can find a lever area.
There.
Over there, beyond those cliffs.
Are you sure you know how to land this thing?
Full flaps.
I think we're on Mars.
We got about 20 mins. head start on them.
It's not gonna be hard to spot this plane from the air.
We got two choices, either we stick together, or we split up and go in different directions.
Hey, I just found a survival kit in here.
There's a can of water each.
A flare each.
John, you take the flint.
Peter and I'll split up the matches.
Anybody want the gun?
I'd shoot my foot.
I'd shoot his foot.
You can take the knife.
Remember, if any of us gets caught, or he can't make it, shoot off a flare, so the others'll know.
I'll continue West. John, you go North.
Peter, you go South.
We came from the East, so we know that's the wrong way.
There's not a lotta time.
There's too much to say, so let's go.
If any of us makes it...
Well...
Did I ever tell you the one about the guy who had a job giving enemas to elephants, and...?
Thanks.
Did you ever hear it?
You can tell me about it when we get home.
Tell Charles that...
thank him for the composition, please.
I...
Well, tell him when I get back...
I'm gonna take him to
Yosemite again,
like last summer.
- I will.
- Right there. Run it again.
Like last summer.
I will.
'Look, sir. Look, sir.
Mr. Knox, sir, let's do tricks with bricks and blocks, sir.
Let's do tricks with chicks and clocks, sir.'
- Blocks! Look, blocks!
- Right.
There are the blocks and those are the...
- Clocks!
- Right.
'First, I'll make a quick trick, brick stack.
Then I'll make a quick trick, block stack.
You can make a quick trick, chick stack.
You can make a quick trick, clock stack.
- Chicks!
- And...?
Clocks!
'And here's a new trick,
Mr. Knox.
Socks on chicks and chicks on fox.
Fox on clocks, on bricks and blocks.
Bricks and blocks on fox and box.
Now we come to ticks and tocks, sir.
Try to say this,
Mr. Knox, sir, clocks... clocks on fix tick, clocks on Knox tock.
Clocks!
Clocks!
Clocks.
Right, Sandy, very good.
'Six, sick, bricks, tick... '
Yes?
I'd like to see Mrs. Brubaker.
My name is Caulfield.
Mrs. Brubaker isn't seeing anyone.
I telephoned this morning.
I believe I'm expected.
- What was that name again?
- Caulfield. Robert Caulfield.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Brubaker is expecting you.
She's out on the patio.
It's right through there.
Thank you
- Mrs. Brubaker?
- Mr. Caulfield?
Sit down, please.
Mrs. Brubaker, first of all,
I'd like to say I'm really sorry.
- Everyone is sor...
- I know, and I appreciate it.
Don't be too uncomfortable with me.
I couldn't put up with that right now.
I understand that you think you're interrupting me, and you are, but I welcome the interruption.
You called and said it was something important. What is it?
Mrs. Brubaker, it may not be important to you.
I'm looking for something that may be important to me. It's personal.
You're a reporter, aren't you?
Yes, as I told you,
I'm not looking for an interview.
I would like to ask you a few questions about the last time you spoke with your husband after the landing.
What about it?
Well, this may sound strange, Mrs.
Brubaker, don't be upset with me.
Just before the conversation ended,
Colonel Brubaker told you something about going on a vacation and your reaction was like you didn't understand what he was saying.
Why would you wanna know about that?
As I told you, it's something personal.
It's personal to me, too.
Please, I'm not trying to embarrass you or anyone else.
Why would any of this be your business?
Please, trust me.
Why?
You ask really good questions.
Well, it's all so silly.
It wasn't anything that dramatic.
Bru just forgot something, that's all.
I don't see the purpose in broadcasting that my husband mistook a vacation when he had so many other things to think about.
No, no, no, I'm not looking for anything to broadcast.
- What are you looking for?
- It has to do with a friend of mine.
- Is there something I should know?
- If there was anything, I would tell you.
Well, it's nothing.
Bru said that he wanted to go back to Yosemite like last year.
Last year, we went to Flat Rock, not Yosemite.
I don't think there's any cosmic significance in that.
Mrs. Brubaker, I truly thank you.
I'm sure you had better things to do than put up with a bunch of stupid questions.
No, I didn't.
Have I been any help to you at all?
I don't know.
May I call you again, sometime?
Yes.
Yes?
There's no one inside?
Are you sure?
Get more personnel, they can't go too far on foot.
Oh, a piece of cake.
Charles, cut it out.
You know you're bothering her.
I know you're bothering her and she knows you're bothering her.
If you want to stay in the pool, cut it out.
- Hi, Uncle Jim.
- Hello there, Charles.
- Hello, Kay.
- Jim.
You look just fine.
Thank you.
Can I offer you something to drink?
No, thank you.
- How are the children?
- Fine.
Charles is strong.
He's very much to himself, but he's strong.
Sandy doesn't know.
There's gonna be a Memorial Service on Tuesday, right here, in Houston.
President... The President'll be here.
- He's going to speak.
- That's nice.
Will I get a folded flag?
I would like you to be there.
Please.
I know how difficult everything is for you right now.
I feel like Jack the Ripper even asking you... It's just that... it would be good for everyone if you could go with me to the service.
- It's a horrible way to die.
- No, absolutely not.
When the heat shield separated, it was over in less than 5 secs.
I know that sounds grizzly, but you just have to know he never suffered.
He died doing what he wanted to do.
Something he felt was important enough to die for.
I know, I know.
I don't think it was important enough for him to die for.
I understand.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I have no right to intrude on you like this. I'll call you tomorrow.
Jim!
I'll go.
You're a very special woman.
He was a very special man.
Thank you.
- Hey, Uncle Jim!
- Yes?
- My Dad went to Mars.
- Yes! Yes, he did!
Oh, I'm dehydrating.
Dehydrating.
Sign.
Manual says...
Iook for signs.
Water.
Manual says... signs for water.
Oh, dried river bed.
Signs.
Bend in the river.
Lower signs.
Bend in the river.
There's just...
Water.
River bed.
Water.
A drink of water.
Elizabeth, there's no water.
There's no water.
I wanna die.
Elizabeth.
Birds.
Elizabeth, birds.
I got to get the birds.
Helicopters...
Yes?
He was alone?
Which direction was he heading from the airplane?
Aah, look South and West only.
Call everybody off North and East.
The other two are South and West.
- Hello, again.
- Hello, again.
- Can I offer you something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.
- What would you like?
- Some scotch. Straight, please.
You haven't found what you're looking for, you're embarrassed about bothering me again, however there were one or two questions more you'd like to ask me.
It's something personal and you won't bother me any more.
I haven't found what I'm looking for.
I feel embarrassed about bothering you.
However, there are one or two more questions I'd like to ask you.
It's something personal and
I won't bother you any more.
You're up to something, want my help and you won't tell me what it is. Why?
You're a very smart lady, you know that.
Yes.
I drink too much.
I get in trouble a lot because
I talk too much.
Sometimes I have an imagination that's a bit too vivid.
Something's wrong and
I don't know what it is.
Believe me, I would never do anything to harm you or your husband, I swear.
What are you after?
I'm taking a terrible risk telling you this.
You may throw me out of here and
I do not want to be thrown out.
I don't think your husband is the kind of man who makes mistakes, no matter how far away he may be.
I think he was trying to tell you something.
- What?
- What did you do at Flat Rock?
Nothing much.
We came home after one day because Charles got sick.
- What'd you do that one day?
- I don't remember.
We took a tour of the town.
They have those tours.
And...
I don't remember what.
- We took some home movies.
- Do you have them?
- Yes.
- May I see them?
Yes.
They were making a movie the day we were there.
Bru got a big kick out of it.
He never knew it took so much time to just do one simple scene.
Charles loves that one.
He wasn't in the greatest mood.
He didn't know it but he was sick.
Bru was fascinated with the detail.
He couldn't get over how something so fake could look so real.
He kept on saying that with that kind of technology you could convince people of almost anything.
There's this guy, you see!
He takes a trip to Europe.
It's his first vacation in a long time.
He sees the sights, you know?
He has a real good time.
Anyway, after a while he decides to call home.
He get his brother on the phone and the guy says to his brother,
'How's everything at home? '
And his brother says,
'Your... Your cat died.'
And the guy says to his brother,
'You shouldn't tell me bad news like that.'
'You should break it to me gently.
You know...
You should say something like,
'The cat crawled out on the roof and the was chasing the squirrels and... he got stuck.
We had to call the fire department and when they finally got there, a fireman crawled up, he grabbed the cat and on the way down he slipped and the cat fell to the ground.'
'They had to take the cat to the vet.
They tried to save the cat.
They even operated on the cat.
But it was too late.
They couldn't save the cat.'
That's how you should break bad news, like that.'
So the guy says to his brother,
'How's Mom? '
And the brother says,
'She's on the roof.
Get it?
She's on the roof.
She's on the roof.
Get it? '
Yes?
Which one?
What direction was he going?
Brubaker is going West.
Put everybody West.
Caulfield.
Right now?
Okay.
How nice of you to join us here!
- Listen, I think I got something.
- You need a dermatologist?
Don't tell me, I'll get it.
- George Raft! Right?
- Where the hell have you been?
I have to talk to you.
I think I'm onto something. It could be your actual ball game. I mean it.
Golly, gee, Scoop, that sounds very interesting!
Something is wrong. Something big.
They know I'm onto it and they tried to kill me.
- Who's they?
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
- You wouldn't believe me.
You don't think so?
Okay, listen to me.
I got a tip from a friend, a good friend, then he disappeared.
Disappeared?
Like he never existed. There's some lady living in his apartment.
His apartment is all different.
She said she's been living there for more than a year.
I checked the building rental office.
They have receipts from her for more than a year.
I checked NASA personnel.
They have no record my friend ever worked there.
They say they never even heard of him.
So this friend of yours, who works at NASA, gives you a tip, then disappears.
And it turns out that he never lived in his apartment or worked at NASA.
This is the guy that gave you the tip on your cosmic scoop,
- and you think I won't believe you?
- My car!
Someone tampered with my car!
The one you decided to go swimming with?
They did something to it!
I couldn't stop it!
Can you prove that?
The police said...
- They said that nothing was wrong.
- And you think I won't believe you.
Somebody took a shot at me!
- When?
- Yesterday.
- Thank God, I've got an alibi!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Listen to me and listen good.
I don't like you, Caulfield.
You're ambitious.
You think the way to get ahead is to come up with the scoop of the century.
Woodward and Bernstein were good reporters. That's how they did it.
Not by telling me they've located
Patty Hearst three times, like you did.
Or that brilliant piece of investigative journalism you pulled off, by finding an eyewitness to the 2nd gunman in the Kennedy assassination.
The small fact that the man had been in a mental institution at the time, never deterred you, not Scoop Caulfield!
Now, most reporters are like me.
They are plodders.
They spend a lot of their time checking little things..., like facts.
They cover mundane stories like wars, and trials and hearings.
You never seem to have enough time in your busy schedule to stoop so low as to cover a story.
You occupy your time with tips from people who never existed, driving your car into water and then claiming it wasn't your fault, getting shot at by unseen gunmen.
Now, I really hate to interrupt your meteoric career with something so plebeian as a legitimate story.
However, a trainload of propane gas had the bad taste to derail near Galveston and there's a whole town that just might blow up.
So it would be just really peachy or you if you would join you film crew that's waiting for you on the plane at this very moment while we speak.
- That was a speech.
- I thought so.
I cannot go to Galveston right now.
I don't think I heard you.
Look, when a reporter tells his Assignment Editor that he thinks he may be onto something that could be really big, the Assignment Editor's suppose to say,
'You got forty-eight hours, kid, and you better come up with something good or it's gonna be your neck.'
That's what he's supposed to say!
I saw it in a movie!
Get your ass on that plane!
I can't! I have to follow this!
And you can't tell me what this earth-shattering story is?
It sounds too crazy.
If I told you, I'd be in more trouble.
You're not crazy! I'm crazy!
I'm crazy for listening!
And I'm crazy for saying what
I'm about to say!
I'll give you twenty-four hours come up with something!
Not forty-eight! I saw the movie, too, and it was twenty-four!
Freeze!
- I'm not moving an inch.
- Robert Caulfield?
- Yeah, who the hell are you?
- Federal Agents.
We have a warrant to search your apartment.
- You have a warrant? What for?
- Just don't move.
I promise. Just tell me what this is all about.
Hey, come here! Look at this!
Could you come with me, please, Mr. Caulfield?
Mr. Caulfield, I'm sorry.
However, you're under arrest for possession of cocaine.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it. You guys put it there, you know you did.
You have the right to remain silent.
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I don't believe it. You put it there.
Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law.
You're part of all this. You mothers.
Ow, that hurts!
You don't have to put handcuffs on me!
Please, Mr. Caulfield, these are serious charges against you.
- Don't add to them by resisting arrest.
- I don't bel...! That hurts!
I don't believe this.
Well, hello there, Caulfield!
So nice to see you!
It's at this point that Alan Hale says to Richard Conte...
- Jimmy Stewart.
- Yeah, Jimmy Stewart, thank you.
Look, Scoop, I can't keep bailing you out of trouble.
The front office is on my neck.
I don't know how much longer
I can keep them off, right?
- Right.
- Wrong!
I got you out of there so as not to embarrass the Network.
I mean, you are a schmuck!
I can't trust you to cover a fire!
You'll probably fall down and get burned!
You probably would be the cause of it!
A company car? You are fired!
I love that so much!
I'm gonna say it again!
You're fired! You're through!
Oh, I love it!
It's not what it looks like, really.
'Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn! '
I told you. You tell me about the lonely plight of a dedicated journalist.
I tell you to stuff it.
You tell me about a meaningful relationship.
I tell you to stuff it.
You tell me you're in trouble, you're out on bail, you just got fired,
I tell you I'll be right over.
- My head hurts.
- You look awful.
- Thank you, very much.
- You're quite welcome.
Did you find out what I asked?
One o'clock in the morning
I get a call from an unemployed junkie to find out all the military installations in a 300 miles radius around Houston, Texas.
You certainly have a way with words.
Did you find out?
Yes, and it wasn't easy.
It took exhaustive research.
Well, I'm proud of you.
How many?
One. White Bluff. It's a SAC base.
My father used to be stationed there.
That's exhaustive research?
At one o'clock in the morning, you call your father, that's exhaustive.
- White Bluff... That's too big.
- Too big for what?
- Too big for what I want.
- What do you want?
I'm thinking of enlisting.
- They'll never take you.
- That's why I'm thinking of enlisting.
- You're on a story, aren't you?
- I was fired!
You're on a story and I'm helping you.
This can't be happening.
I really appreciate that.
The only reason I'm doing it, considering your track record, whatever story you're on will turn out to be garbage.
You shouldn't mince words.
I'll fix you some coffee.
Then you can jump me.
There's no other one besides
White Bluff?
No.
Except one abandoned base they used for training during World War II, Jackson.
There's nothing there now.
- Don't you want to jump me?
- Of course I do. Where's Jackson?
About 300 miles directly West.
I think I'm gonna get angry with you.
- Do you have any money on you?
- Do you want me to pay you?
How much?
About 100. Why don't I just leave it on the dresser in the morning?
Give it to me now.
In advance?
That's the height of conceit!
Please, and your car keys.
You're really being terrific, why?
You're not as obnoxious when you are helpless.
- Thank you very much.
- You're quite welcome.
Also, Liz Haller said you were super.
Well, when I get back, we'll jump each other.
Maybe.
I'll get arrested again.
It's a deal.
Mornin'.
- Mornin'.
- You in charge here?
- You see that sign there?
- Yes.
Well, read it.
- I did.
- Out loud!
'A and A Crop Dusting Service'.
You wanna know who I am?
I'll bet you're one of the 'As'.
Well, which one? I'll bet you can't answer that question, smart-ass!
- The first one.
- Wrong!
- Can I have one more gues?
- You got it.
The second one.
Wrong. I'm both of 'em!
'A' and 'A'. My name is Albain.
I got a son. The other 'A' was for him, but he don't like to fly and is a lawyer.
He's a pervert, so I took the 'A' away.
Wanna speak to somebody in charge?
You're speakin' to both o' them.
- My name is Caulfield.
- Hey, I can't help that.
Mr. Albain, how much do you charge to dust a field?
- 25 dollars.
- I'd like to hire your plane.
- That'll be 100 dollars.
- You said you charged 25.
25 dollars t' dust a field, but you ain't got no field because you ain't a farmer, which means you ain't poor and I think you're a pervert!
Okay, 100.
- What?
Because you said 'yes' to 100 too quick, which means you can afford 125!
Where do you wanna go, smart-ass?
I'm not sure. I'm looking for someone who's lost.
It's your money.
Put your Goddamn head down so I can see!
Why didn't you sit in front?
- You know how to fly?
- No!
Then I gotta sit in back and you gotta put your Goddamn head down, smart-ass!
Now, what the hell is your friend doin' out here?
He's lost!
- He rob a bank or somethin'?
- No!
- Well, I get a third!
- What?
We find him, I get a third of the loot!
Now, keep your Goddamn head down!
You think we should go in another direction?
- Hey!
- What?
- Over there!
- Where?
Helicopters!
I seen them fly around here last couple of days!
- Let's follow 'em!
- I would if I could see 'em!
They're goin' down over there!
He must be in there!
Let's go down.
They got guns, Sonny!
You said you wanted a third of the loot!
- Half!
- Okay, half!
Keep your Goddamn head down!
Pull that lever down by your feet when I tell you, Sonny!
Now!
Perverts!
Remember, I get half!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. Brubaker
Mrs. Willis, Mrs. Walker,
my fellow Americans.
I come here today to talk of unfinished hopes
and of unfulfilled dreams.
Charles Brubaker, Peter Willis and John Walker
left this Earth for their dream a little more than eight months ago.
They were never able to return to us.
Their dream was able to grow and flourish because of the support of millions of citizens all across America at a time when cynicism was a national epidemic, they gave us something to take pride in.
It is a dream that should not be allowed to die.
A nation is built on the spirit of its people.
The test of the greatness of any nation is how that nation pulls together in a time of crisis.
The only limits on what we can achieve are the limits we place on our hopes.
These three men reminded us of the limitlessness of our hopes.
There was a moment in these past few days when we were all one people.
We were all hoping, we were all a little bit taller, a little bit prouder.
We were all feeling the same fears and the same exhilaration.
These three men brought us together.
We knew together that there are no goals we cannot reach if just reach for them together.
There is no adequate way in which we can express our gratitude to the men themselves because they are no longer among us.
However, we can serve their memory, what they stood for...
"In the beginning,
God created beast and man so that both might live in friendship and share dominion over a world of peace."
"But in the fullness of time, evil men betrayed God's trust, and in disobedience to His holy word waged bloody wars, not only against their own kind, but against the apes, whom they reduced to slavery."
"Then God in His wrath sent the world a savior, miraculously born of two apes, who descended on Earth from Earth's own future."
"And man was afraid, for both parent apes possessed the power of speech."
Come on.
"So both were brutally murdered."
"But the child ape survived, and grew up to set his fellow creatures free from the yoke of human slavery."
No.
"Yet, in the aftermath of this victory, the surface of the world was ravaged by the vilest war in human history."
"The great cities of the world split asunder and were flattened, and out of one such city our savior led a remnant of those who survived in search of greener pastures, where ape and human might forever live in friendship, according to divine will."
"His name was Caesar, and this is his story in those far-off days."
- You're not gonna make it, Jake.
- We'll make it.
I'll show you how.
- Thanks, Aldo.
- You will call me by my proper rank.
General.
Yes, General.
Don't put him in the corral.
I won't be long.
"Ape shall never kill ape."
Shall ape ever kill man?
You're late, General Aldo.
Come and read this to the class.
- I won't.
- You won't because you can't.
And you can't because you don't want to learn.
And it is my duty to report this to Caesar.
If my father were a gorilla, we'd all be learning riding instead of writing.
Silence. Silence.
Cornelius...
Remember - you are Caesar's son and heir.
Being a good rider isn't enough for being a good ruler.
Though, in human history, quite a number of military dictators seem to have thought so.
Now, all of you, take your charcoal sticks and parchments and copy down what l"ve written.
The best shall be hung from these hooks.
I can think of better things to hang from those hooks.
- But, Virgil, can we tamper with time?
- Accept my premise.
- What premise?
- Man learned to travel faster than sound.
He could have learned to travel faster than light.
- We accept.
- Then imagine a musician giving a live broadcast from London to New York on a Wednesday.
He then travels faster than light from London to New York, where he arrives, as physicists would confirm, on the previous Tuesday.
Listens to his own broadcast on the Wednesday, dislikes its quality, then travels faster than light to London, in time for him to decide not to give his broadcast.
Come. I'll prove it to you logically.
Good, Cornelius.
But you"ve made a mistake here.
You have put a b in place of the second p.
Teacher, have you forgotten your own name?
Everyone has always called me "Teacher" -
I had forgotten. "Ape shall never kill Abe."
Thank you, Cornelius.
That was a very kind thought.
Gorillas?
All right, Aldo, let's start with you.
General Aldo.
With respect, General Aldo, this is barely legible and will have to be written again.
Your capital A leans over like a tent in a high wind.
And your capital K...
"Ape shall never kill Abe."
No, Aldo, no.
Teacher! Teacher.
You have spoken the unspeakable.
In all our years of slavery, "no" was the one word we were conditioned to fear.
Caesar has forbidden you its utterance in perpetuity.
An ape may say no to a human, but a human may never again say no to an ape.
Tell him you're sorry, Abe, and go home.
I'll put in a good word for you with Caesar.
General Aldo, I'm... I'm sorry. The writing you destroyed was by Caesar's son.
I did not want you to suffer Caesar's anger.
What do I care for Caesar's anger?
Let me give you a taste of mine.
Stop him.
Get him. Get the teacher.
Stop! Stop.
We'll teach the teacher a lesson.
Throw him in the corral, where all humans belong.
I said stop, Aldo.
He broke the law. With his own mouth, he broke the First Law.
- I am the law. What has he done?
- Caesar.
I...
I was there. Teacher only reverted to type under provocation.
He... he spoke like a slavemaster in the old days of our servitude, when we were conditioned to mechanical obedience.
He uttered a negative imperative.
Could you put that into words which even Caesar could understand?
He said "No, Aldo, no."
- The schoolroom was wrecked.
- The class is ended.
The schoolroom is closed.
Now we go back to riding horses.
Aldo!
You and your friends will return to the schoolroom and put it back in order.
Abe, no gorilla is to be dismissed until everything is back in its place.
- Yes, Caesar.
- Father?
Since there won't be any more school today, may I go out and play?
- Well, can't you study in the house?
- I could, Father, but...
Run along and play.
Where are my students? I was in the midst of explaining my theory of time relativity.
- If Caesar permits, I would like to...
- Caesar permits.
- You look concerned, MacDonald.
- I am, Caesar.
I think that Aldo's hatred is not confined to humans.
Look out!
I think Aldo may be riding for a fall.
If only my mother and father, whom I was too young to remember, if only they'd lived.
Perhaps they would have taught me if it was right to kill evil so that good should prevail.
But you know, Caesar, history shows...
Now that is human history, not ape history.
Ape never kills ape.
Here's the list of our winter supplies so far.
Well, l"ve gotta be getting along.
I'm starving. I could eat a horse.
- A horse?
- You remember Lisa.
They used to eat lots of things.
Dead cattle, dead chickens, dead pigs.
Now we live and chew nuts at our masters" command.
- That will be all, Julie.
- Thank you.
We are not your masters.
We're not your equals.
MacDonald,
I believe that when you truly grow to know and trust a person, you cannot help but like him.
When we grow to know and trust your people, then we shall all be equals - and remain so until the end of the world.
- Which may be sooner than you think.
- You are such a pessimist.
- Or a prophet?
- Well, now that apes are at the helm,
Earth will sail safely through space until the end of time.
And Virgil says "Time has no end."
So you see, I cannot believe you.
Would you believe it if you heard it from the lips of your own parents?
- Are my parents alive?
- No.
- But their images and their voices are.
- MacDonald.
When you talk about my parents, please do not speak in riddles.
I cannot see or hear them.
They came out of the future.
They cannot give me knowledge.
Caesar... You can see them.
You can hear them.
And they can give you knowledge.
- How?
- Under the dead city where we once lived, in the archives near the old command post, there are tapes - sealed tapes - of Cornelius and Zira being examined by officials of the American government.
When my brother was Governor Breck's assistant, he told me about them.
I know where they are. And I know that they concern Earth's future, from which your parents came.
But the city was flattened.
The bomb left nothing.
Except, I suspect, the archives section - indeed, many sections of the underground city were designed to survive the impact of a ten-megaton overblast.
Then the tapes and pictures of my parents...
Are still down there.
MacDonald...
I want to see what they look like.
I... I suppose every orphan does.
I want to hear what they thought and knew.
The city's radioactive.
Yeah, well...
Let me see, who... who is there among your people who knows something about radioactivity?
- No one.
- Among mine?
Who knows everything about everything?
Virgil. Go and find him.
Lisa, you remember your parents.
I was too young when they died to remember mine.
But I don't want to have to remember my husband. I want to love him now.
Look, Virgil will be with us.
Now, we'll take good care.
Say goodbye to Cornelius.
I don't want him to know I'm afraid.
Cornelius?
Cornelius.
Father.
- I'm going on a journey.
- What will you bring me back?
What would you like?
More nuts for my squirrel.
He's growing fast.
So are you.
One day you will be as tall as a king.
Mandemus?
- He's asleep.
- Not eternally, I trust?
Mandemus.
- Who's there?
- Caesar.
- What does Caesar want?
- Weapons.
For what purpose?
Self-protection in the pursuit of knowledge.
- Self-protection against whom or what?
- We don't know.
Why protect yourself against a danger of which you have no knowledge, in pursuit of a knowledge you do not possess?
Oh, God!
- Is it a knowledge for good or evil?
- All knowledge is for good.
Only the use to which you put it can be good or evil.
- Well put.
- Thank you.
The sun is rising. I should like to get this matter settled before it sets.
Caesar has appointed me not only as the keeper of this armory, but as the keeper of his own conscience.
That is why I have asked six boring questions, and propose to ask a seventh before issuing or not issuing the weapons you require.
What is the nature of the knowledge you cannot seek without weapons?
The knowledge of Earth's ultimate fate, recorded on tapes in the forbidden city.
Which is contaminated, but still may be inhabited by humans.
Come in.
- Name your protective pick.
- Three submachine-guns.
- For?
- The removal of obstacles.
One...
Two...
- And three. Now what?
- Ammunition.
I really don't hold with knowing the future - even my own, which is short.
A Geiger counter.
If we knew for a fact there was an afterlife, and that the afterlife was bliss eternal, we'd all commit suicide in order to be able to enjoy it.
Pistols.
- To remove smaller obstacles?
- It's a three-day journey.
With Caesar's permission, MacDonald may want to shoot, cook and eat a rabbit.
But who needs three pistols to shoot one rabbit?
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.
He may be old, but he's got a mind like a razor.
When I was a boy, he was my teacher.
Let's collect our stores and be on our way, huh?
There it is - or was.
Like a storm at sea, but solidified.
By a bomb from an armory
1,000 times the size of ours.
And nobody to keep its owner's conscience.
This is the hell my forefathers used to speak about.
Do you know where we are, MacDonald?
Yes. Now, this is...
I mean was, 11th Avenue.
Ape Management was two blocks east from here.
The archive section, two blocks west - corner of Breck and Ackerman.
Get us there quickly.
The Governor's very irritable lately.
Who wouldn't be, living in this hell of radiation all these years?
If the bomb hadn't killed the old governor, boredom certainly would have.
Alma, I just want somebody to talk to.
Anybody.
We are at best brave and at worst mad to be here.
This background radiation alone will give us 300 roentgens per hour.
Meaning?
That unless we leave this place within two hours, we shall become inmates.
This is a ghost city.
I want to put some flesh on it.
Radioactive flesh?
Well, we're all radiated, but at least we're active.
Getting stronger. We must hurry.
Governor, look.
- F6. F6.
- What now?
Alert Mendez.
Men... Mendez to Control Room.
Mendez to Control Room.
Mendez to Control Room.
Somebody's breached the warning system at F6.
- One of our scavengers.
- No. It's been locked for years.
- It must have been someone else.
- Impossible. There is no one else.
Mendez, we have to act, and act quickly.
- Alma?
- Yes, sir?
Work the B console.
Quick, Mendez, quick. Quick.
No, quicker. Faster.
Keep going... No, no. Back. Back.
This is the place.
That's Caesar, come back to reconquer his kingdom.
Doesn't he know that the bomb did that?
- We're still all right.
- This way.
Quicker. Quicker.
There. Hold it.
Can anything live down here?
I mean, for long?
Yes. But in the end, not recognizably.
The black man is the brother of my predecessor's personal assistant.
He supervised the archives.
I don't think I know the orangutan.
- Look.
- It's been there for years.
The late governor had this whole place equipped with cameras.
To forestall ape conspiracies, as I remember.
Archives. We haven't been in there since...
I wonder what the devil they want in there.
We'll find the tape we're looking for under the heading of "Presidential Commission."
"Proceedings of the Presidential
Commission on Alien Visitors, 1973."
- Is this it?
- Let's see.
Yes, that's it. Now, if this thing works, the picture should come out on that screen over there.
All security forces, alert.
All security forces, alert.
Check out all sections in areas M5.
Apprehend three strangers you will find there.
One human and two apes.
But caution. I repeat, caution.
If they resist, you may shoot.
But shoot to maim.
We want them alive for interrogation.
If we shoot, we break 12 years of peace.
Yes, it has been rather boring, hasn't it?
My mother.
Who won your war?
It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas" war.
The date meter on the spaceship.
What did it read after Earth's destruction?
And you talk to your pupils about eternity.
There are only three.
There must be more. But how many?
That's the question we'll have answered when we get them.
My father.
That's my father.
How did apes acquire the power of speech?
They learned to refuse.
On a historic day, there came an ape who spoke a word which had been spoken to him time without number by humans.
He said "No."
No wonder all mankind thirsted for my blood and wanted my birth aborted.
In the year 3950, apes will destroy the Earth.
Not apes. Gorillas.
- Besides, that's only one future.
- How can there be more than one?
You remember the old motorways?
I believe that time is like an endless motorway, with an infinite number of lanes all running from the past into the future.
It follows that a driver would try to change his lanes and change his future.
If you left this room right now, you might wind up shot. Dead.
If you left a minute later, you might survive.
It's a blind choice, but you can change lanes.
I know what it is I want to change.
The camera. It moved.
Are you sure?
Virgil's right.
Governor? We just lost the TV monitor.
Our 8-41 archive.
- I'm not interested in equipment failures.
- It wasn't a failure. It was destroyed.
- We have to find another way out.
- Is there another way?
They got past you? Then shoot on sight.
Never mind about bringing them here.
Just get them.
Don't let anyone escape alive.
Sections M5 and R7 and 8.
Form a group here. Quick, quick.
All right, move out. Move.
Move! Move!
Hurry! Run!
Run!
Now you"ve got your guns, we need another patrol quickly.
Quickly, men. Hurry. Hurry.
The rest of you, take your weapons and go to M5.
Go. Go. What are you waiting for?
To R8.
All forces into exit level 3.
They're getting away. Kill them.
Kill them. Kill them!
You knew every bolt and nut in those corridors.
You have a hundred armed men.
How could you let them escape?
They were fast and smart, Governor Kolp.
Many of my men were sick.
And the chimp surprised us.
Yeah... He surprised me too, once.
But he's an animal. He's only an animal.
No, Governor, he's more than an animal.
He can speak.
- So can they all.
- So speech makes them human?
Speech makes them intelligent.
And intelligence may make them not human, but humane.
- Perhaps they came in peace.
- Idiot. They were armed.
From what we saw on the monitor, only for self-protection.
Let them return in peace.
- To where?
- To wherever they live.
So that they can come back and exterminate those of us the bomb has not exterminated?
- Where do they live?
- They came with few provisions.
- It can't be too far.
- Which way did they head?
- They headed north, Governor.
- Organize scout parties.
Assemble workable equipment and follow them to their camp.
Yes, Governor Kolp.
Why, Governor?
So that we can exterminate them.
- It's Caesar.
- What a welcome.
- We should have stayed in the city.
- The city is forbidden.
- I know. I forbade it.
- Then why?
If a king forbids his subjects to wear a crown, that doesn't mean he can't wear one himself.
Caesar is Caesar.
He went to the city for a reason.
What reason?
I went looking for my past.
But I found our future.
Explain.
- You wouldn't understand.
- Aldo will make the future. With this.
Well then,
Aldo may very soon be in the past.
Cornelius.
Cornelius, are you all right?
- No, Mother. I'm just dead.
- Dead?
- We were playing war.
- War?
Cornelius, hasn't your father explained to you that war is not a game?
Yes, Mother.
And also forbidden you to play with guns?
- Yes, Mother.
- Then you'll stop it.
- Yes, Mother.
- Now come along. Father wants us.
My friends, I have convened this extraordinary meeting of the council in order that I may report upon an action which I deemed necessary: a reconnaissance expedition to the forbidden city, with Virgil and MacDonald as my aides.
Why MacDonald? Why not a soldier?
Because we went in peace to what we thought would be a dead city.
But, in case there were some survivors, we took MacDonald with us so that he could parley with them and secure permission for our search.
Survivors there are...
Maimed, mutated, hostile and human.
- Did the humans follow you here?
- We saw no sign of it.
But we must prepare for the day when they may come out of the city, when they may come to find us.
No humans in council.
No humans in council.
No. No. No. No.
Yes!
They are here because I sent for them.
Now that we know the danger, we need their help and counsel.
No. No.
- Yes.
- Come.
We shall not sit in council with humans.
Now, let us reason together and make plans.
Somewhere along the line of history, this bloody chain reaction has got to stop.
A destroys B, B destroys C, C destroys A and is destroyed by D, who destroys E.
Before anyone knows where they are, there won't be anyone left to know anything.
Governor.
Governor, the captain has come back.
We found it, Governor. We found Ape City.
Where?
This... This is a gorilla outpost.
Below is a valley with orchards and vineyards - enough to feed hundreds.
- Here is Ape City.
- Was it very large?
- It is of a size we can deal with.
- Were you seen?
No, sir.
Caesar was busy with a council of war.
One day soon they'll be coming for us.
No, we're going after them - now.
You have your orders.
Caesar... On the Night of the Fires you swore an oath that in the future, apes and humans would live together in kindness and peace.
Why are you now making every sort of preparation to break that oath?
Because, unlike the humans in our city, those in the forbidden city are mad.
Mad enough not to want peace and friendship, but enmity and war.
- Did they tell you that?
- Yes.
Yes. By opening fire on us without giving us a chance to explain.
You were trespassing on their territory.
But Lisa, we didn't know the city was inhabited.
But how, if you didn't speak to them, do you know its inhabitants are mad?
Lisa, you didn't see them. They're...
They're malformed.
Like the freaks in your foster father's circus?
- Were they mad?
- What's "malformed"?
- Cornelius, go to bed.
- When l"ve given Ricky his water.
Lisa, freaks are different.
These humans are the end product of nuclear radiation.
They're mutant, and they're mad.
- Keep all emergency channels open.
- Yes, Governor.
All emergency channels will remain open.
If anything should miscarry,
I'll signal you as arranged.
Yes, sir.
Hurry, man. We need it.
The school bus will be operational,
Governor.
The convoy will join us at junction C.
Get moving.
Ricky?
Without guns, we have no power.
We shall take the guns, and we shall keep them.
They equal power.
Guns. Guns are power.
We are an elite. We are a superrace.
We have the right to lead.
Without us, there would be no army.
What is an army without guns?
We need power. We deserve it.
We deserve to have power.
We need power.
Guns. Guns. Guns are power.
We shall get them, and we shall keep them.
With guns, we will smash the humans.
All humans.
And then, we will smash Caesar.
Look.
- It's Caesar's son.
- And he overheard every word we said.
Cornelius... Come down.
Come down, or else.
Father...
Cornelius?
Father!
Cornelius!
I only heard about it this morning.
His squirrel is missing.
- He must have been out looking for it.
- How is Cornelius?
Hurt. He's badly hurt.
Speak the truth.
Even if we had a hospital...
I'm not going to tell Caesar. Not yet.
He still believes he can change the future.
Humans - going towards our city.
I'll get him.
Get ready to fire. Fire.
The doctor is doing her best.
I don't believe Cornelius can live.
Caesar does. He... he refuses to leave his side.
How can a benevolent God allow the branch of one of His own trees to crack and injure an innocent child?
It didn't crack, Virgil. It was cut.
Order at council. Order. Order.
The humans are attacking.
They have killed one gorilla, and they have wounded another.
Tell them.
We were scouting desert approaches to the city and saw their army.
They fired. My companion was killed.
- I have come to warn you.
- And how long before they get here?
Soon. So now we must prepare.
Take the humans out.
Lock them all in the corral.
Aldo. Aldo, you can't do this.
You're acting against Caesar's orders.
Caesar is not here.
Hey. What the...?
Jake... Strong man.
Take him to the corral.
Take all humans to the corral.
All humans. Take them to the corral.
Where are you going?
Martial law has been declared.
- Everybody is to stay in their homes.
- By whose orders?
Go home.
We want guns. Guns are power.
Now we go and get guns.
- Mandemus.
- Who's there?
Aldo. General Aldo.
- What do you want?
- Guns.
- Guns.
- What will you do with them?
- We shall do with them what we will.
- "Do what you will" is the Devil's law.
- And who are you, Mandemus? God?
- I am the keeper of Caesar's conscience.
- And I am the keeper of Caesar's army.
- Under allegiance to Caesar. Where is he?
Mandemus, as I speak, our city is being attacked by humans from without and within.
- Who cares where Caesar is?
- I care.
There is a law that weapons may only be issued under direct orders from Caesar, not under threats from a thick-headed subordinate, for whom war means only personal glory.
Now find me Caesar. I will listen to him.
First, listen to this.
Take every gun in the place. Everything.
Get the ammo boxes.
Get the handguns, grenades.
Stop. Stop! Caesar forbids you.
Well, there it is. Ape City.
When we leave, I don't want to see one tree left standing, two pieces of wood nailed together, or anything left alive.
I want it to look like that city we came from.
What the devil is all that rubbish down there?
Some sort of barricade, sir.
Nothing that a couple of flame bombs won't take care of.
Caesar, forgive me, but I couldn't get here before now.
Aldo has seized power.
He's broken into the armory and imprisoned all humans.
- MacDonald?
- He was dragged away by Aldo's gorillas.
I can't leave Cornelius. He needs me.
Every ape and human in Ape City needs you. Now.
I... I think you should go to Cornelius.
Father?
They hurt me.
They want to hurt you.
Who hurt you? The humans?
No...
Then who?
Shall...
Shall I be malformed?
No.
One day you are going to be as tall as a king.
Captain, lay the smoke screen, and when
I give the signal, start the bombardment.
Men and equipment out of the bus.
Deploy your weapons, quickly.
- All is in order, sir.
- All right, let's go.
He said they hurt him. Who?
Who would hurt him?
I think you'll have your answer - and soon.
- What do you know?
- That's what I know.
- You did this.
- For security.
Did you raid the armory for the same reason?
- For security.
- Caesar.
I order you to stop this. I order you to stop it now and release those people.
See? Aldo was right.
War has come. Let's go.
Go to the barricade. To the barricade.
Come on. Go to the barricade.
They're laying a smoke screen.
Here they come.
- Where's Aldo?
- Probably the other side of the valley.
Hurry! Fall back! Fall back!
Fall back. Go back to the village.
Get away from the fire. Fall back. Hurry!
Flee the barricade. Fall back! Fall back!
Get back to the village.
You can't stay here any longer.
You must save yourself.
Caesar.
Your people weakened our city by rebelling against your human masters.
But we who survive will create a new race.
And you and yours will be brought low.
And you shall learn again what it is to have a master.
You're learning already.
Clever ape.
Oh, no.
Ape. Clever ape.
But then you always were clever.
I was told how you chose your own name.
But every Caesar must have his Brutus.
Did you know that, ape?
Do you understand that, ape?
And now Ape City is about to lose its king.
No, Kolp! No!
Now. Fight like apes.
No. Stop. No killing. Take them captive.
Let's get moving.
No. No, no, no. Don't kill them.
Take them prisoner.
No. No, Virgil.
All right, Virgil. Let's go home.
No prisoners. No prisoners.
Dismount.
Caesar! Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
- Let the humans go, Virgil. All of them.
- No.
They stay. Aldo says what we do now.
They have done nothing.
They shall go free.
You like humans?
You want them out of the corral?
All right. Kill them. Kill them.
Kill them all.
Stop. Stop!
No more killing, Aldo.
Put down your weapons.
- Take them back to the armory.
- No. We shall keep the guns.
Move, Caesar, or we shall kill you.
Ape has never killed ape, let alone an ape child.
Aldo has killed an ape child.
The branch did not break.
It was cut, with a sword.
Aldo... You... You killed...
Aldo killed.
Aldo has broken our most sacred law.
Our child... You killed our child.
What's the matter with them?
I guess you might say they just joined the human race.
Ape has killed ape. Ape has killed ape.
You murdered my son.
You murdered my son.
No.
Should one murder be avenged by another?
Only the future can tell.
So let us start building it.
If we appear to be lacking in gratitude,
Caesar, what have we to be grateful for?
If you mean to set us free, then free us completely.
- What do you mean?
- We are not your children, Caesar.
We have a destiny too. As equals.
Respecting each other.
Living together, with love.
Love?
The human way is violence and death.
Aldo wasn't human, was he, Caesar?
Virgil...
You are a good and wise ape.
And you, Caesar, are a good and wise king.
We'll rebuild what's ruined and begin again.
Tell me something, MacDonald.
Can we make the future what we wish? l"ve heard that it's possible, Caesar.
There. Every weapon is back in its proper place.
Caesar, I want to ask a favor.
This armory's been my home for 27 years.
You may live in it for the rest of your days.
But I don't want to live in it. No, no.
Now that the danger is over,
I want to see it destroyed, blown up.
The greatest danger of all is that danger never ends.
And so, Mandemus, we must be patient and wait.
We still wait, my children.
But as I look at apes and humans living in friendship, harmony and at peace now, some 600 years after Caesar's death, at least we wait with hope for the future.
Lawgiver, who knows about the future?
Perhaps only the dead.

            [girl] nice landing,
            Uncle Bene.         
                 Right on the   
                 50-yard line.  
[boy] should've gone for a touchdown.                
 Next time, I'll put it         
 right between the goalposts.   
[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.               
 [Bene] that's why we arranged  
 this little vacation.          
 We've been so busy establishing
 our community on Witch Mountain
    That you two haven't had    
    an opportunity              
 To see what life               
 in the big city is all about.  
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.          
    [chuckling] there'll be     
    another time for that.      
 Just remember what I told you, 
 and have a lot of fun.         
         - It's locked.         
         - Tia?                 
     Tony, come back here.      
Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary.      
Tia?                            
If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too.
     [tires screeching]         
     [brakes squealing]         
    You the party               
    I'm supposed to pick up?    
 - [Bene] just the children.    
 - All right.                   
    Meter's running, hop in.    
         I got it.              
        [cabbie grunts]         
     I've been                  
     waiting here forever.      
You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people.      
                 We're exactly  
                 on time.       
Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up.         
I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months.
            We have seats       
            on the 50-yard line.
         [Tony laughs]          
            Deliver the children
            to this address.    
             You'll be paid     
             after you arrive.  
This is a big fare here.        
If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip.      
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday.            
 - Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene.     
 - Goodbye.                     
     - Have fun, you two.       
     - [tires screeches]        
[engine revving]                
                 [horn honking] 
     - Look at that dummy.      
     - [honking horn]           
             Get off the road,  
             you dummy.         
                         [sighs]
        These civilians         
        don't know how to drive.
         They ought to be       
         kept off the streets.  
 The streets belong             
 to us professional drivers.    
     Taxis, buses, trucks.      
 That's all that should         
 be allowed on the streets.     
 You see, I happen to know      
 a great deal about driving.    
I have a perfect safety record. 
                 [honking horn] 
            Come on, get out    
            of the way, you bum.
                         [sighs]
        [car doors shut]        
     [woman] thank you.         
     Thank you, sickle.         
Well, this is a perfect test site.            
Little traffic...               
...And low real estate value.              
                 It's adequate, 
                 I suppose.     
Ok, let's get this over with.   
This thing on all right?        
                     It's ready.
     What do you want him       
     to do this time?           
     I want you to              
     climb that fire escape...  
    ...To the absolute top.     
         Wait a minute.         
             Uh-uh.             
    This is as high as I go.    
     You want me to             
     break somebody's leg?      
 Just tell me how many pieces.  
 But up there, I don't go.      
- Why not?                      
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.               
I will fall.                    
     That is true, Victor.      
     He has acrophobia...       
     ...Among other things.     
 Find a different test for him. 
    Acrophobia is not           
    a problem with my device.   
        Start climbing.         
I will do anything else you say,
But I am not going up that building, understand?   
         - I...                 
         - Sickle...            
 ...I command you               
 to climb up that fire escape.  
                You will go     
                to the very top,
         You will turn around,  
         and you will look down.
     And you will not           
     be frightened of heights.  
                     Off you go.
                 It's working.  
                 It's working!  
It seems to be.                 
Victor. Victor, you are risking his life.       
He's my nephew.                 
My only living relative.        
He's the only one               
I can leave my...               
...Uh, my bankruptcy to.        
     That's what experimentation
     is all about, Letha.       
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.             
     I am the only one          
     we cannot afford to lose.  
 Can't you see that I've got    
 complete control over his mind?
             He has no fear,    
             no memory, no will.
        He can only             
        carry out my commands.  
 - [car rattling]               
 - what... What's happening?    
We're out of gas.               
What are you, crazy? Look at the dial, it points to... Empty.
             Empty?             
     - [exhales]                
     - [horns honking]          
         It was all that waiting
         I had to do for youse. 
 I'll run down the street to the
 gas station and get some gas.  
Boy, oh, boy.                   
         You guys are costing me
         a lot of dough.        
         I sure hope you        
         make the tip worth it. 
Something's going to happen to someone near here.           
             We've got to help. 
No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver.   
I'll go.                        
I think it came from back that way.                  
                     Be careful.
             And remember what  
             Uncle Bene said.   
That is enough.                 
Bring him down!                 
     [victor] sickle,           
     turn to your right.        
        Balance yourself        
                 And walk along 
                 the ledge.     
             [Letha] Victor, no.
             Stop.              
I'll bring him down myself.     
Give that to me.                
     [wires crackling]          
                    Look what   
                    you've done.
     [exhales sharply]          
         Sickle, stop.          
    Sickle, I'm                 
    commanding you to stop.     
 Sickle, this is Dr. Victor     
 Gannon commanding you to stop! 
     - He's out of control.     
     - [Letha] sickle!          
Go back!                        
 [Letha screeching] sickle!     
             No!                
                 Letha... Look. 
        - I can't look.         
        - You must.             
         [footsteps approaching]
        [Letha] it's miraculous.
There are no miracles, Letha.             
Only scientific explanations for everything.                 
Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing.              
        It... Must be...        
        ...That... Boy.         
    There's a...                
    There's a force that...     
 ...Centers around that boy.    
     A force capable            
     of countermanding          
 The basic physical law of...   
 Gravity.                       
 Victor, I don't know           
 what you're talking about.     
    Molecular mobilization.     
 - I need that boy, Letha.      
 - [horns honking]              
 - I need him desperately.      
 - Now, just a minute.          
             Brilliant, my boy. 
             Brilliant.         
Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic...              
Well, whatever it was you just did,                   
It was absolutely heroic.       
        It was nothing,         
        I just... [gasps]       
     [tires screeching]         
            [sirens approaching]
[dog barks]                     
[helicopter approaching]        
[boy #1] get off the street!                     
        - [boy #2] run!         
        - [boy #3] hide!        
        [boy #4] here come      
        the goon goons!         
         [older boy #1]         
         let's get 'em!         
    [older boy #2]              
    they run like chickens.     
[boy #1] more goons!            
         [boy #2] we're trapped!
[boy #3] hide or they'll get ya.
         Over here.             
[older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans. 
[older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang.        
             Let's finish 'em.  
     [older boy #1] hey!        
[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?
        It was a set up.        
    - Let's give it to 'em.     
    - Yeah.                     
         - [all yell]           
         - hey!                 
         [laughing]             
     That was an ambush!        
     [older boy #2]             
     stop banging into me.      
 [older boy #1] I can't see.    
[older boy #3]                  
I can't get out.                
 [older boy #4] get me out.     
 Get it off me.                 
    [boys] yeah! All right!     
Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out.         
             Yeah, thanks a lot.
     - What's your name?        
     - Tia.                     
         - I'm Rocky.           
         - I'm muscles.         
     - Crusher.                 
     - And I'm dazzler.         
 We're the earthquake gang.     
            Does that scare you?
             - No.              
             - Aww.             
Let's change our name again.                 
We gotta have a name that scares.             
            - Yeah.             
            - Hey.              
 How'd you do what you done?    
     Well, I really             
     didn't do anything.        
     Yeah. You a magician       
     or something?              
             No.                
 You want to join our gang?     
    I'm sorry.                  
    I'm looking for someone.    
        - Thanks anyway.        
        - Aw, sure.             
     I guess you're like        
     the rest of them.          
     You've heard               
     we're a nothing gang.      
    Yeah, well we ain't         
    always gonna be nothing.    
     Someday we're gonna        
     be the toughest.           
 Take over the whole territory. 
    Someday they're gonna run   
    when they see us            
    coming down the block.      
         All right.             
    It's just that              
    I've got to find my brother.
 What gang does he belong to?   
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]                
 I never heard of a Guy         
 that never belonged to a gang. 
 I'm sure something's happened. 
 I've got to find him.          
    If anybody could find him,  
    we could.                   
     I mean, we know            
     this town inside out.      
         Oh, would you?         
        Hey, yeah, sure.        
Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you.        
     Thank you.                 
     Thank you very much.       
    Hey, come on, let's go.     
            That Tony sure      
            made himself scarce.
 - We better walk you home.     
 - Where do you live?           
I... I was supposed to stay at a hotel.                
But I don't know which one.                      
        You could stay          
        in our hideout.         
         - [boys] yeah!         
         - Thank you.           
     We'll look                 
     for Tony tomorrow.         
     If we aren't busy          
     beating up goons.          
     - Yeah.                    
     - Hey, it's yo-yo.         
        - Get down.             
        - Come on, hide.        
        - Did he see us?        
        - I don't know.         
 - But he's coming this way.    
 - [Tia] who is he?             
 - [muscles] our worst enemy.   
 - He's worse than the goons.   
 [Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto,     
 the truant officer.            
         He's trying to make us 
         go back to school.     
     [dazzler] let's go.        
         [all] yeah!            
             That's our hideout.
     [stairs creaking]          
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?            
        [Rocky] don't say things
        like that.              
        This place could        
        really scare ya.        
            [gasps]             
Come on.                        
 This is where we're gonna live 
 when we run away from home.    
        Yeah, you can't be tough
     If you take orders from    
     your mom or older sister.  
        That's why              
        we quit school.         
     You can't be tough         
     and educated, too.         
[crusher] yeah.                 
        - Tony!                 
        - [boys] where?         
 I had a contact with him.      
You...                          
You calling on the spirits?     
             Shh.               
        - She's weird.          
        - She's creepy.         
    I... I ain't too sure       
    I wanna meet this Tony.     
             Shh!               
     Tony, where are you?       
     He's coming in again.      
    I can only see a light.     
    That's all.                 
    Now it's... Going black.    
 Now it's... Completely gone.   
     [machines beeping]         
                He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes            
As he struggles to regain consciousness.        
His output is so great,         
That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it.   
             But he's dangerous.
Once I have control of his brain, Letha,            
He will only be dangerous to others.         
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
My experiments are more important than the law, Letha.  
With these receptors placed on certain people,       
Combined with this boy's powers,              
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.   
         Oh, you are absolutely 
         brilliant, professor.  
             Now we can go ahead
             with my plans, too.
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant.     
 A comment, perhaps, on you and 
 the life you've been leading.  
             Now, you look here,
    Doctor, professor,          
    physicist. Whatever you are.
     I built this laboratory    
     for you at great expense.  
     I used every penny I had.  
 Now, we've made a lot of plans 
 and I won't let you upset them.
        I want some money. Fast.
Letha, we are worlds apart.                   
My mind is filled with large concepts.            
Mankind, the universe.          
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.      
            Sure, I gamble...   
     ...But with my own money.  
                You're the worst
                kind of gambler.
            You use             
            other people's money
     And want to keep all       
     the winnings for yourself. 
         Well, you can be sure  
         of one thing, Victor.  
     I'll be around to pick up  
     the chips with you.        
    - [wires pop and sizzle]    
    - [Tony moans]              
         [panting]              
         [grunting]             
    We'll be back in the morning
    with maps and breakfast.    
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.           
             And I'll bring some
             day-old bread.     
- I'll bring some milk for you. 
- Thank you.                    
 - You're good friends.         
 - That's the trouble with us.  
 We don't want to be good.      
 We want to be bad.             
             Yeah.              
 Hey, uh, let's go, you guys.   
 My mom's gonna yell at me.     
[crusher] see you tomorrow,     
Tia.                            
 [muscles] we'll find Tony      
 tomorrow for sure.             
 [Rocky] let's stay close       
 together on the way out, guys. 
            [sighs]             
                         Good.  
             This is            
             professor Gannon...
             ...Commanding you  
             to awaken.         
[indistinct shouting]           
                         Tony!  
 He's in some kind of a room.   
                Like a hospital.
     With machines              
     and instruments and things.
Oh, that's easy.                
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.     
     While we going around      
     looking for a fight.       
            Come on.            
 [victor] you will now function 
 exclusively under control.     
            You will no longer  
            think independently.
     All thinking and reasoning 
     will be done               
             By the voice       
             that commands you. 
             Do you understand? 
     - Yes.                     
     - What is your name?       
     - Tony.                    
     - Where are you from?      
Witch mountain.                 
        Sounds like             
        some hick town to me.   
         How did you suspend    
         Mr. Sickle in mid-air? 
     By energizing matter.      
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow? 
         Yes, sir.              
- How did you learn to do this? 
- I was born with the ability.  
 I wish to see a demonstration  
 of molecular flow.             
                You are strapped
                to the table.   
             Unbuckle yourself  
             and sit up.        
         Power has come         
         into our hands         
     Which is centuries         
     before its time.           
We must use it wisely.          
                Well, what can  
                you have him do?
     Other than go around making
     people's belts unbuckle.   
The possibilities are unlimited.
     Oh, come on. It's just     
     some gimmick, that's all.  
Tony...                         
         Mr. Sickle,            
         whose life you saved,  
             Doesn't seem       
             to believe in you. 
         Mr. Sickle             
         needs convincing, Tony.
[knob squeaks]                  
         [gas hissing]          
         Hey, come on.          
Hey, get back!                  
     Get back! Get back!        
Don't.                          
[grunting] get back!                       
[goat bleats]                   
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention. 
But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?   
[goat bleats]                   
     I will demonstrate         
     an industrial application. 
Come with me, Tony.             
         [gas continues to hiss]
             Now, Tony,         
             those wine casks...
         Stack them... Neatly.  
            Two glasses         
            of burgundy, please.
                 To molecular   
                 mobilization.  
 To molecular capitalization.   
        - [goat bleats]         
        - [gas hisses]          
[muscles] hey, got any more clues?             
             No.                
        Nothing at all.         
        It's so strange.        
 We've been to every hospital   
 and he's in none of them.      
             It's like          
             his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.           
 - Don't listen to him.         
 - We'll find Tony for sure.    
     Yeah, we'll turn           
     the town upside down.      
Yeah.                           
 - [sickle] what're you doing?  
 - [Letha] thinking.            
Thinking about us in a different place, such as...   
Las Vegas...                    
...With Tony.                   
             Seven or eleven    
             every time, right? 
A day at the races.             
             All the long shots  
             come in.           
[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all.      
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.        
For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them.  
If he can stack them, he can unstack them.            
         The gold is on display 
         at the museum.         
    Protected by an impenetrable
    security system.            
             Just sitting there 
             waiting for us...  
             ...To penetrate it.
Wait a minute. Us?              
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?     
 Professor Gannon is            
 extremely busy being a genius. 
 I own half the invention,      
 Half of Tony, that means       
 I own half of the profits.     
     So far, the return on      
     my investment has been     
     half of zero.              
What about security. We'd need an army to pull it off.    
     We'll have an army with us!
             Tony.              
         [chuckles]             
              Tony?             
              Tony?             
      Tony, why can't I         
      get through to you?       
              Tony?             
I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops.  
Be back later on.               
            [Letha] don't worry.
                 Everything's   
                 under control. 
            Tony.               
            This is Letha wedge,
             Commanding you     
             to open your eyes. 
                 Now, stand up. 
     We're going to the museum  
     for education and profit.  
        [brakes squeak]         
        Tony and I will do      
        a little... Sightseeing.
     [indistinct chatter]       
                     [Tia] wait.
     Gold! I see gold.          
        - Hey it's mine.        
        - Where is it?          
     - Hey, give it to me!      
     - No!                      
         A stagecoach.          
     She must be tuned in       
     on a western.              
                         Yeah.  
         I see dummies.         
     [both] that's you.         
        No. Old things.         
                     Clothing.  
             Hey, he's at       
             the salvation army.
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army.          
            They don't got gold,
            neither.            
                Wait a minute,  
                wait a minute!  
         We had one of them     
         nothing school trips.  
                 To the museum. 
                 Yeah, they got 
                 a pile of gold.
And a stagecoach.               
They had to kick me out.        
     We've got to go there.     
                 Come on,       
                 it's over here.
        [kids grunting]         
     [indistinct chatter]       
        [tires screech]         
Now, Tony.                      
We're going to create a little diversion.             
The stagecoach.                 
I want you to roll it all around the museum.          
[woman gasps]                   
[woman] look out.               
                 [man] watch it.
[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way.           
Hey, where are the horses?                     
                I... Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.          
                [man] watch out.
            [yelps]             
Short circuit the control system.             
    [control system buzzes]     
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [guard screams]         
            Oh, no.             
             Letha!             
             Letha!             
     [indistinct shouting]      
[chortling]                     
         - [gasps]              
         - look out.            
        [man] get out of my way.
         [moaning]              
         [guards yell]          
[man] can't you put that thing out?                 
Come on, take a shot.           
Move it.                        
Now, Tony,                      
Make a hole in the plastic shield.          
And it doesn't have to be neat. 
Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 
 [man] move it buddy, move it.  
 We gotta get out of here!      
Las Vegas, here we come.                   
             Oh!                
     - Look.                    
     - [bars thudding]          
                     Come on,   
                     follow me. 
Tony, make them go faster.                      
     [woman] watch out!         
    Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha!     
     - [woman screams]          
     - [man] hey!               
     [indistinct chatter]       
        Look out, lady.         
Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy.    
            [gasps]             
     [man] look out, Eddie!     
[Letha] Tony, what's happening? 
[Tony] molecular flow reversing.
     - Are you doing this?      
     - No.                      
Then who is?                    
             It would have to be
             one of my people.  
 - There are more like you?     
 - Yes.                         
 - Oh! Let's get out of here.   
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
             Tony!              
Who's that?                     
                 It's my sister.
                 My sister, Tia.
This is no time for a family reunion.           
     [crowd murmuring]          
[victor] Letha!                 
             Tony!              
         [victor] you fool!     
         How could you do this? 
        [Letha] not now.        
     - [door shuts]             
     - [engine sticking]        
        - What's wrong?         
        - I don't know.         
 I keep it running perfect.     
It's Tony's sister, she did it. 
She's as weird as he is.        
     Tony, I command you to     
     make this car run perfectly
 And continuously without       
 interference from your sister. 
        [engine starts]         
     I can't stop the car.      
     Tony's energizing it.      
         It's like your brother 
         doesn't even know you. 
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo. Let's go! 
- No. Don't run.                
     You crazy? You don't want  
     to go to that school.      
     Please, trust me.          
     Now, come on, hurry.       
 [Rocky] hey, wait for me.      
 [dazzler] come on, you guys.   
 Get in there.                  
     - Let's go!                
     - Come on, get in.         
        - [door shuts]          
        - I'm dreaming.         
 You're surrendering            
 to the board of education?     
Sir, you see that car going down the street?          
     - Yeah.                    
     - My brother's in it.      
He ought to be going to school. 
You ought to catch up with him. 
    Another truant? Oh, boy,    
    we're gonna have a load.    
     - Hey, what happened?      
     - Good driving, yo-yo.     
Yeah, that was neat.            
             [laughs] this bus  
             can really move.   
             Tony, look         
             through the window.
                The rear window.
                That minibus    
                is following us.
         I command you to place 
         obstacles in its path. 
         [tires squeal]         
     City property.             
     I've damaged city property.
                     [moaning]  
[panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof.
 Was that a bus or a bridge?    
         They're still with us. 
        Tony, you must stop her.
Man, that man was really buzzing.                 
     Am I still alive?          
        [tires screech]         
         They're gaining on us. 
     She counteracts            
     everything that Tony does. 
                Tony, you've    
                got to stop her.
                        We flew!
        [boys cheering]         
             They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.                    
     Sickle... Sickle, stop...  
     Stop over that hill.       
 Tony, cause the reflection     
 of the sun on the rear window  
             To magnify and     
             shine so brightly  
            That our pursuers'll
            be blinded by it.   
        [glass breaking]        
             [van scrapes road] 
[muscles] come on, open the doors.                 
     [crusher] I can't see.     
- [Tia] yeah.                   
- [muscles] come on, let me out.
    - Everybody ok?             
    - [all kids] yeah, sure.    
        Oh, look what's happened
        to city property.       
No... But I'm still gonna take you to school.       
     - Just soon as I...        
     - Come on.                 
     [siren approaching]        
You jeopardized my life's work. 
My accountants' are desperate.                  
         You've proved yourself 
         incompetent yet again. 
        I don't even know if    
        I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?             
I trusted you enough            
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.         
Don't tell me you don't trust me.             
We have to trust each other.               
     Right.                     
     I trust everybody.         
             Yes...             
             Well, fortunately, 
         I thought of something 
         very spectacular       
 Which will satisfy both of us  
 in terms of prestige and money.
Well, you have the prestige,    
I'll take the money.            
But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,          
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.            
     How did she know           
     we were at the museum?     
                I...            
                I'm not certain.
Tony.                           
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?     
         Telepathy.             
            She'll show up again
            and ruin everything.
In that case, she will have to be, as you would say... 
...Scratched?                   
     [Tony whispering] Tia.     
          [louder] Tia.         
              Tia!              
  [Tia] what happened to you?   
  [Tony] I can't explain now.   
     I've lost                  
     the power to energize.     
      [Tia] where are you?      
  [Tony] follow my voice path.  
  Please!                       
      [Tia] ok. Guide me.       
         [dog barks]            
      Tony, which way?          
              [Tony] this way.  
        [sirens blaring]        
      Which way, Tony?          
      Which way?                
 [Tony] keep moving             
 straight ahead.                
      This is the house.        
          Here, look.           
          Come on.              
        - [door closes]         
        - down here.            
                 [goat bleats]  
     Be quiet, Alfred,          
     you silly thing.           
          [Tony] Tia!           
             Tony!              
            [yells]             
         [gas hissing]          
     I've put her into a state  
     of comatose neutralization.
 [crusher] hey, Tia.            
 We got you some cold hotcakes. 
        She ain't here.         
 Hope she didn't go             
 looking for Tony without us.   
             Yeah, she needs us.
      [Tia] Tony? Crusher?      
         Muscles? Rocky?        
      - Dazzler?                
      - [Alfred bleats]         
             Alfred.            
  Alfred,                       
  what's the matter with me?    
          Where am I?           
  Alfred, find the earthquakes. 
         [bleating]             
         Listen to me.          
         [bleating]             
    [hoof steps approaching]     
         [bleating]             
     [sickle] what kind         
     of place is that?          
 [victor] that is an underground
 plutonium processing plant.    
         Translate that         
         into financial terms.  
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.        
             That's why         
             I like scientists. 
     They're always discovering 
     new, expensive things.     
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.    
             I suppose you're   
             going to have Tony 
             Split an atom bomb 
             or something.      
In effect...                    
...Yes                          
         Well, I didn't count on
         killing anybody.       
             Especially not us. 
It will never go that far.      
They will pay anything to prevent it.         
This is the first step towards my becoming             
The most powerful man in the world.                   
         Ids, please.           
         Take a powder.         
                     [laughing] 
Tony.                           
Those are the outer security scanners.        
 Put them out of commission...  
        ...Permanently.         
            [static]            
            The scanning systems
            are malfunctioning. 
            All right, let's run
            a maintenance check.
Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right.  
    - Where to?                 
    - Andy's place, know it?    
Yeah, sure. I know where everything is. Second and third?
 - [man] fourth and market.     
 - That one.                    
 - Hop in.                      
 - I'm in a hurry. Could you... 
            [grunts]            
        - Don't worry.          
        - [tires screech]       
    Have you there              
    in a couple of minutes.     
[Alfred bleats]                 
            Listen.             
 Feel the power in this cab?    
    - [Alfred bleats]           
    - it has lots of power.     
 You know, everybody tells me,  
 I ought to be a race driver.   
     - What do you think?       
     - [bleats]                 
 Well, I think you're wrong.    
Don't worry about nothing, sir. 
I'm a very safe driver.         
- Want me to tell you how safe? 
- [Alfred bleating]             
     I'll tell you anyway.      
 I've been driving a hack       
 for 19 years and 11 months.    
 And in all that time, I never  
 even put one scratch on a cab. 
     In fact, next month,       
     They're gonna give me      
     a gold safety award.       
 - What do you think of that?   
 - [bleating]                   
 Boy, you don't like nothing.   
     - I sure hope              
     you're a good tipper.      
     - [bleats]                 
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.     
     [tires screeching]         
[cabbie] hey!                   
             Hey!               
     You owe me a fare!         
                 [cabbie sighs] 
 - Officer, that goat's a guy.  
 - The goat?                    
         The guy became a goat  
         when I'm driving.      
The guy?                        
     This magician              
     beat me out of this fare.  
The magician?                   
    - My perfect record.        
    - Record? Oh... Record.     
         I ain't gonna get      
         the gold safety award. 
 - [hoof steps approaching]      
 - hear that? That must be her. 
         - [bleats]             
         - come on.             
 [boys grunting and panting]    
     [dazzler] help me.         
[grunts] hey. Watch out.        
        - [bleating]            
        - get him away.         
    - [moans]                   
    - how'd you get in here?    
        Hey, come on,           
        get out of here.        
[Rocky] watch out!              
             He's looking at me 
             like he knows me.  
 Hey, what do you want from me? 
                     Get away!  
     He's got Tia's vest.       
            Get him!            
             Quick.             
  - [phone ringing]             
  - we're going for coffee now. 
    - [phone ringing]           
    - can I bring you a cup?    
     May I see your ids, please?
Tony?                           
Show him our id.                
     What's happening?          
Why?                            
    Don't leave me up here.     
                Open the door,  
                Tony.           
     You can't go in there      
     without ids.               
     - Now seal it.             
     - How do I get down?       
         [boys panting]         
             Tia!               
 - Quick, let's get her out.    
 - Yeah.                        
     - Phew, it smells.         
     - [boys cough]             
It's some kind of a gas.                       
Come on.                        
        [inhales deeply]        
         You ok now?            
        Yes, thank you.         
    This is some kind of...     
     ...Science place.          
     - How'd you get here?      
     - It was Tony.             
                    He was here.
        I saw something!        
         What was it?           
        It's where Tony is.     
        I'm sure of it!         
     A big, round shape.        
A doughnut!                     
He's eating a doughnut.         
No way!                         
     Is it like a ball?         
     A great big ball?          
     - Yes.                     
     - I know where he is.      
         Let's go!              
        Hurry, let's go.        
                 [Alfred bleats]
     Oh, thank you.             
     And thanks for everything. 
     Come on, let's go.         
We are about to make scientific history.     
         [Letha] and some money,
         too, I hope.           
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.  
[alarm ringing]                 
It's a red light on the cooling system.          
     It must be                 
     a circuit breaker.         
     Restart the system.        
I can't get a restart.          
         Hit the backup system. 
It's no-go on backup.           
Temperature increasing in the furnace.                 
 - Get that coolant flowing.    
 - [phone buzzes]               
     - Furnace control.         
     - Control?                 
 You don't really think you're  
 controlling anything, do you?  
 - [alarm continues buzzing]    
 - who is this?                 
      [victor] this is          
      Dr. Victor Gannon,        
  And I have just shut down     
  your cooling system.          
        Ok, you've shut it down.
        Get it back on again!   
        Tell him how expensive  
        it is to put it back on.
In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium,      
Medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met.   
        What conditions?        
Five million dollars in cash.                        
A jet waiting at the airport.   
A safe escort, of course.       
And most important of all,      
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon          
Has achieved molecular control and mind control.               
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.    
        [line cuts out]         
 How long does it take          
 to count five million dollars? 
        [alarm ringing]         
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [siren wailing]         
     [indistinct shouting]      
     [machines beeping]         
We'll have to pay them.         
 Evacuate the immediate area.   
 Put Los Angeles on alert.      
         [horn honking]         
There's the big round ball.                 
 - Is that it?                  
 - No, it was bigger than that. 
        Get outta here.         
            Leave me alone.     
            At least I tried.   
                     Hey, look. 
It's yo-yo.                     
Let's get out of here.          
            Come on.            
             [radio plays music]
 Hey, yo-yo.                    
 Don't you want to catch us?    
I don't trust him.              
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.    
            Come on.            
[dazzler] hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?     
        It's not my job anymore.
             They're coming down
             to fire me...      
             ...For destroying  
             city property.     
The only thing that works is the radio. And it won't turn off.   
     I was only trying          
     to help you kids.          
         Mr. Yokomoto,          
 I'm sorry about                
 everything that's happened.    
 All I ever wanted in life      
Was all you kids that           
I put back in school, someday...
     ...Visit me and say,       
 "thanks Mr. Yo-yo, Yokomoto.   
 If it wasn't for you           
 forcing us to get an education,
    We would've been bums."     
     That's all I wanted.       
You see?                        
I told you he was gonna...      
 ...Hit us with                 
 some of that heavy psychology. 
     I mean, I feel guilty.     
     [man on radio] bulletin    
     from the plutonium plant.  
  Unless the demands            
  of the terrorists are met,    
 The furnace will explode       
 with the force of ten megatons.
  An official describes         
  the atomic furnace controls   
  as frozen in position,        
 - As if "the molecular flow..."
 - that's Tony!                 
- The plant is being evacuated. 
- That's where he is!           
    - We've got to go there.    
    - How? Take a bus?          
 - We'll go in this.            
 - Tia, the tires are flat.     
            Come on.            
        [tires screech]         
     [machine beeping]          
If it doesn't start cooling soon,             
The chain reaction will start.                     
                 You hear that? 
                 In ten minutes,
     This place is going to be  
     a hole in the ground.      
     Now, let's be reasonable.  
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.    
 And the balance is on the way. 
                    It's a deal.
I do not compromise.            
     [alarm continues]          
- Hey, what are you guys doing? 
- [man] nothing! Nothing!       
     We're doing nothing.       
         - Hey, kids!           
         - [man grunts]         
How did these children get past security?              
 Sir, the people destroying the 
 furnace kidnapped my brother.  
             If I could see him,
             I might stop them. 
    - [boys] she can do it!     
    - She can do it.            
        - [alarm beeps]         
        - do what?              
Impossible, they're inside the room.        
They've sealed the door somehow.               
- What part has to be fixed?    
- The emergency cooling system. 
     - Where is it?             
     - Five levels down.        
But it's too late. We've already begun to evacuate the plant.    
Tony's here, all right.                      
         Get me down.           
 Thank you, thank you.          
 Now, where are you going?      
                     In there.  
Oh, no. You can't go beyond this point without ids.  
 - [footsteps approaching]      
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
         - Tia!                 
         - I knew it.           
 She'll spoil everything.       
 I can just taste that money.   
     We cannot let her          
     take it away from us.      
                         Tony!  
 Tony, from this moment         
 you will no longer hear Tia.   
    She cannot break through    
    my power of control.        
 - Acknowledge.                 
 - [Tia] Tony, what's wrong?    
          It's me, your sister. 
             Try to remember me.
         Acknowledge.           
              Tony?             
     - Yes, sir.                
     - Get those kids.          
        She'll use some of those
        molecules on us.        
I'll take care of her before she gets a Chance, you get them.
 [Tia] I can't get through.     
     I don't know what          
     they've done to his mind.  
 We've got to find the emergency
 cooling system ourselves.      
 How do you spell cooling?      
                        Come on.
     - [Tia] uh-oh.             
     - [muscles] whoa.          
             [Rocky] look out.  
     [rapid footsteps approach] 
    We've got to find           
    the emergency switches.     
    You two go that way,        
    and you two go that way.    
                 Tony, we must  
                 eliminate Tia. 
[footsteps approach]            
 You will cause that portable   
 utility panel to run her down. 
     - Hey, Tia, come here.     
     - [machines whirring]      
            Come on.            
     That ain't it, right?      
     - [Tia] you found it!      
     - I knew it was it!        
     But, it's spelt wrong.     
            You guys get        
            dazzler and muscles.
         Ok. Come on.           
                 [door opening] 
         The rest of the money's
         just arrived.          
         All right.             
    I'd better call Gannon.     
The cooling system's on.        
         Switch it off.         
     [man] we lost it!          
 What's going on down there?    
             It's coming back.  
            Gotcha!             
    Tony, you must stop her.    
             Tony, why are you  
             doing these things?
    Why are you using           
    your powers against me?     
                What's happened?
                         Tony...
                ...Pretend      
                to remember Tia.
     Lure her to the            
     center of the room and...  
             ...Make that crane 
             drop on her.       
             Tia!               
 I'm starting to remember.      
                What was the    
                matter with you?
I don't know, exactly... But... 
         I need help.           
     Don't go any closer.       
     Why? What is it, Tony?     
         Tony, stop it!         
         Stop it, Tony, stop it!
Exert a force greater than hers.              
 Why are you doing this, Tony?  
 Stop.                          
                    Crush her.  
                    Kill her!   
                     Crush her! 
         Crush her! Crush her!  
                     Finish her!
     - Now!                     
     - [Tony groaning]          
Tia.                            
Where are we?                   
What's happened?                
        [victor screams]        
         - Ha!                  
         - [boys yell]          
                 [victor] Tony. 
     Tony, we can still do it.  
         We can still make use  
         of molecular control.  
Ok, doc, let's do it.                    
         [moaning]              
         [grunting]             
            [footsteps approach]
         [boys pant]            
        [victor] Letha!         
    Why don't we                
    all go and have some...     
     Some candy and, uh,        
     sodas and ice cream?       
[Letha moans]                   
                    Next time...
     - ...Next time I'll...     
     - Forget it.               
I've lost my faith in science.  
     - [sickle grunts]          
     - huh?                     
         [boys moan]            
        [victor] sickle!        
[moaning]                       
        Aunt Letha!             
        Oh, aunt Letha.         
             Help.              
     [gasping] aunt Letha?      
     Aunt Letha?                
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.            
     - Come on.                 
     - [engine shuts off]       
         Tony, the bus won't run
         without me in it.      
             It's all my fault. 
             It's such a mess.  
Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it.            
             I'm sure Uncle Bene
             won't mind.        
         I'll do the engine.    
         You do the body work.  
     - Ok.                      
     - So long, Alfie.          
     - Goodbye, Alfred.         
     - [blows kiss]             
[bleats]                        
     What job will you do now,  
     Mr. Yo-yo, uh, Yokomoto?   
    Oh, I've saved my money.    
    I'll probably open          
    a Japanese delicatessen.    
     - [metal scraping]         
     - hey, kids, look.         
    I don't understand this.    
     - Man!                     
     - Wow, what a family.      
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...        
 - ...Somehow.                  
 - Uh, that's a possibility.    
     You know what this means?  
     They never saw the wreck.  
 I'll tell them that the reports
 were exaggerated.              
         And, if you kids       
         will go back to school,
                 I'm sure they  
                 won't fire me. 
You will go back to school, won't you?                      
         Well, if we was        
         to go back to school,  
         Could we get as smart  
         as Tia and Tony?       
     - Maybe even smarter.      
     - Yeah, sure.              
Let's give it a shot.           
             Great.             
 I hope the school can take it. 
     - Goodbye, yo-yo.          
     - Goodbye.                 
- [Rocky] see you later, yo-yo. 
- You promised.                 
     Tia, open the gate.        
 No, everybody join hands.      
            - Whoa.             
            - Wow.              
         [boys] cool!           
[muscles] all right!            
Wow! Flying saucer!             
Will we ever see you again?                  
                 Well, it's...  
                    It's kind of
                    hard to say.
Thanks for everything.          
     And especially for         
     letting me be in your gang.
Take care of Alfred for me, ok?                     
         [all laugh]            
There you are.                  
    - Where's your luggage?     
    - Uh, we lost it.           
                 There were     
                 a few problems.
    - But you did have fun?     
    - Oh, terrible.             
I just knew we should have gone surfing.       
     [mechanical whirring]      
         [all] wow.             
Hey. Let's do it the way        
Tia and Tony taught us.         
         [all] yeah.            
    - Ready?                    
    - [all] one, two, three!    
         [all grunt]            
         - Hey, yo-yo!          
         - Yo-yo!               
         [panting] guess what!  
     Tia and Tony just drove off
     in a flying saucer.        
        - Flying saucer?        
        - Whoosh!               
Whoosh?                         
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?          
                 But, it's true.
    Lookit, I saw those two kids
    do miraculous things.       
I believe anything and everything, except that. Get in.
     I hope this school teaches 
     about flying saucers.      
Yeah.                           
                Flying saucers. 
                [laughs]        
[engine starts]

{5291}{5355}I hope your faith|in me will be fully justified.
{5366}{5390}I just made|a wager.
{5396}{5420}A little champagne|to success?

{5495}{5532}Oh, no.|I'd better not.

{5821}{5847}Dr. Perry|was kind enough

{5897}{5928}It took me|longer to graduate

{6981}{6994}But can you|tell me,
{7000}{7042}is it really|your intention to eventually explore
{7048}{7093}deep into|the bowels of the earth?
{7099}{7156}Sir, we've been|on top of the earth long enough.
{7162}{7227}It's about time|we found out what's underneath.
{7523}{7554}Great crowd,|huh, doc?
{7560}{7618}Concentrate,|David. Close doors.
{7713}{7748}Locks on.
{7764}{7797}All secure.
{7804}{7820}Ahh!
{7826}{7847}How are we?
{7853}{7870}Ready to go,|doc?
{7876}{7923}Oh, yes!|Yes, my dear fellow.
{7932}{7988}I'll just check|the gyroscopes.
{8073}{8099}Ahh!
{8105}{8138}Very nice.
{8153}{8217}Well, would you like|to move off, my boy?
{8228}{8257}Ready and|willing, doc.
{8263}{8311}Good luck,|and happy landings.
{8363}{8371}Oh, dear.
{8377}{8435}Where is that smoke|coming from?
{8441}{8494}Ah, yes. Well, you'd|better put that out
{8500}{8542}until we're|underway.
{8548}{8593}Procedure check.
{8646}{8682}Vision ports.
{8694}{8743}Opening vision|ports.
{8935}{8964}Control.
{8975}{8996}Begin lift,
{9002}{9049}steady up|to 10 degrees.
{9071}{9132}Check the|inclinometer as we go, David.
{9230}{9264}Milford,|get the horses ready,
{9270}{9309}otherwise I|shall lose 50 guineas.
{9315}{9333}No cheating,|Archie.
{9339}{9386}You can't|start until they're off.
{9546}{9610}15...|right. Hold at that and lock off.
{9616}{9672}Locked off.|Thank you, control.
{9689}{9743}Vision lights,|aft.
{9776}{9828}Vision lights,|forward.
{9853}{9887}Nose-cutters.
{10017}{10033}Right!
{10039}{10088}Bring in the|crawler banks.
{10214}{10271}Firing engines,|now.
{10390}{10412}Here we go.
{10645}{10675}Release.
{10789}{10829}Up a little|on the throttles, David.
{10853}{10894}I have her at 1800.
{10979}{11004}Oh! Back up,|David!
{11098}{11135}Going in again.
{11273}{11290}Gripping now.
{11296}{11328}Cut in|the tail pan.
{11334}{11359}Tail pan at 300.
{11365}{11406}Come on,|girls. Off we go.
{11412}{11453}Come on,|Milford.
{11471}{11514}Steady|the throttles.
{11550}{11585}We're in.
{11685}{11705}Slow her down,|David.
{11711}{11776}On the throttles.|Don't cut the engines.
{11847}{11855}Whew!
{11861}{11899}By gad!|That cannot be possible.
{11905}{11961}Quick. What does|the distance meter read?
{11974}{12009}Confounded|contraption!
{12015}{12045}It should be|700 feet deep
{12051}{12108}by the time we get|it back to horizontal.
{12204}{12245}She's going|too fast.
{12317}{12348}I can't change|her course,
{12354}{12408}most extraordinary|thing!
{12453}{12504}The mole is burning|up inside, doc.
{12596}{12665}Can you... can you just|take over, David?
{12684}{12733}I-I must...
{12739}{12797}don't give up, sir|I can't, I...
{12814}{12839}ah, oh, ah...
{12845}{12894}Doc! Doc Perry!
{12916}{12965}Ohh!|Don't...
{14130}{14179}Perry! Doc?
{14256}{14307}Oh, Doc!|Huh?
{14333}{14344}Doc!|Oh!
{14350}{14401}You all right?|Where wh-where was I?
{14476}{14509}It's c-c-c-old.
{14538}{14578}The temperature...|hmmm?
{14592}{14625}Look at it.
{14635}{14675}I can't see|a thing.
{14681}{14707}Oh!
{14713}{14727}Ice.
{14733}{14785}Ice. It can't|be possible.
{14795}{14860}Fascinating. Just|make a note of the...
{14880}{14885}oh!
{14891}{14950}Just make a note of|the temperature, will you?
{15016}{15054}She's going up!
{15075}{15119}A little more|throttle, David.
{15340}{15367}Temperature's|rising, doc.
{15373}{15403}We're on our|way home.
{15442}{15454}Not quite.
{15460}{15501}We appear to be, uh,|in the middle
{15507}{15568}of a... an underground|lake at the moment.
{15675}{15690}Ohh!
{15696}{15712}Excellent!
{15718}{15732}Excellent!
{15738}{15793}Lifting nicely.|Knew she'd do it.
{15801}{15817}Lifting nicely?
{15823}{15869}Bom bom bom|bom bom de de bom
{15875}{15934}bom bom bom|bom bom de de bom
{15977}{16009}Hold on, doc!
{16173}{16207}Hold on.
{16333}{16367}Ohh!
{16719}{16770}Total|power failure?
{16776}{16821}Oh, how very|disappointing.
{16827}{16856}It must've been|the water.
{16862}{16923}I didn't allow|for that contingency.
{16943}{16967}Well, doc,
{16973}{17015}shall we see|where we are?
{17027}{17046}Yes.
{17052}{17065}Oh.
{17071}{17122}I'll, uh, just|get my umbrella.
{17133}{17190}The weather seems|so changeable.
{17239}{17276}Ah!
{17282}{17342}Ah, where did I put it|amongst all this lot?
{17357}{17392}Ah! There it is.
{17909}{17939}Doc?
{17961}{17982}Doc!
{17988}{18027}Yes... yes. What?
{18033}{18060}Come on.|Come here, quick.
{18066}{18128}I really must|check the reason
{18145}{18182}for that|power failure.
{18188}{18229}I don't like|being...
{18328}{18384}what an|unbelievable sight.
{18453}{18467}Oop!
{18473}{18508}Steady,|doc.
{18532}{18560}David!
{18566}{18573}This can't be
{18579}{18646}the other side|of the hill, surely.
{18652}{18717}Unless it's|changed dramatically.
{18849}{18882}Well,|where are we?
{18902}{18962}Look at this|Mesozoic moss.
{18979}{19018}Or is it|a cycad?
{19038}{19065}I'm not sure,|I...
{19071}{19140}I've only seen it|before in fossilized form.
{19146}{19171}I would dearly|love to
{19177}{19203}take a frond|back with me.
{19209}{19251}Great, doc.|Just great.
{19257}{19310}But where on|earth can we be?
{19358}{19376}Doc?
{19382}{19400}Oh, I say.
{19406}{19445}Steady, they|may be stingers.
{19451}{19505}Onward,|dear boy.
{19647}{19708}What an|extraordinary sky.
{19745}{19795}What a strange|color, doc.
{19804}{19868}This cannot be|the Rhondda valley.
{19895}{19951}I've never seen|anything like it.
{19957}{20002}Like nothing|on earth.
{20210}{20253}David?
{20259}{20304}We are not|on earth.
{20310}{20324}We're not...
{20330}{20357}well, if we're|not on earth, doc,
{20363}{20381}then where|the hell are we?
{20387}{20434}From my|observations, dear friend,
{20440}{20519}I can positively|state that we are under it.
{20555}{20567}Under?
{20573}{20627}At the|earth's core.
{20797}{20839}By Jove!
{20850}{20894}How very|interesting.
{20958}{20984}Uh, d-doc...
{20990}{20996}mmm?
{21002}{21024}I-I don't|think you
{21030}{21071}want to get too|close to that.
{21173}{21178}Yes.
{21184}{21258}It is a somewhat|aggressive looking... creature.
{21652}{21690}David!
{21696}{21727}Oh, dear!
{21772}{21810}David,|don't lose contact.
{21841}{21879}Doc!
{21970}{22013}Shoo! Shoo!
{22082}{22114}Oh!
{22269}{22300}Oh!
{22436}{22467}Oh, oh dear!
{22526}{22557}Oh!
{22631}{22666}Ohh!|No, doc. This way.
{22687}{22722}Oh, dear.|Oh!
{22765}{22801}Here.|Oh, dear.
{22824}{22876}Take care of|yourself, David.
{22896}{22930}Oh!|Hang on, doc.
{23469}{23504}David?
{23520}{23558}Hang on, doc.
{23625}{23655}Oh!
{23748}{23778}Ugh!
{23930}{23962}Take that!
{24266}{24294}Come on!
{24350}{24382}You ugly...
{25633}{25665}Oh, dear.
{25671}{25696}Oh, oh, I say!
{25793}{25835}I say,|do be careful.
{26298}{26343}But we came|in peace!
{26546}{26576}Ugh!
{26661}{26691}Oh, oh, David,
{26697}{26751}how good|to see that you're safe.
{26757}{26768}Ohh!
{26774}{26834}Did you ever see anything like this before?
{26843}{26850}No.
{26856}{26891}Those prisoners|look human.
{26897}{26907}Yes.
{26913}{26925}And they|appear to be
{26931}{26975}intellectually|superior to our captors.
{26981}{27014}I do find|that interesting.
{27020}{27072}They seem a pretty|subhuman species,
{27078}{27099}yet the|master race.
{27105}{27128}Isn't that|always the way?
{27134}{27186}Yes, the power|of aggression, dear boy.
{27192}{27227}Brawn|before brains.
{27233}{27252}No! Don't|hit him!
{27258}{27330}I'll remember him, doc,|but they all look the same.
{27336}{27380}Yes.
{28367}{28405}Ugh!
{28788}{28800}David,
{28806}{28857}don't you think|it's about time we introduced
{28863}{28925}ourselves to|our fellow sufferers?
{28931}{29000}Dr. Abner Perry|at your service, ma'am.
{29059}{29102}David.
{29108}{29124}Dia.
{29130}{29174}Dia?
{29204}{29246}You can|call him Doc.
{29280}{29322}Ghak.|Oh, Ghak.
{29417}{29444}Oh!
{29450}{29476}Dia?
{29482}{29513}Who's that man|up in front
{29519}{29552}who keeps|looking at me?
{29558}{29602}He is Hoojah|the sly one.
{29608}{29654}Do not|trust him.
{30470}{30499}Perry?
{30566}{30616}Doesn't it ever|get dark here?
{30632}{30649}According|to my watch,
{30655}{30695}we've been|traveling for 2 days.
{30701}{30745}No, here there|can be no night.
{30751}{30801}Just perpetual|daylight.
{30807}{30852}We are in a cave,|you understand,
{30873}{30897}a gigantic cave.
{30903}{30942}And the sky|is the underside
{30948}{30981}of the earth's crust...
{30987}{30993}the magma,
{30999}{31079}probably something|like 20 miles above us.
{31112}{31145}Oh.
{31268}{31308}Conserve|your energy, dear boy.
{31314}{31346}We're both|going to need it.
{31352}{31391}That was my|father's watch.
{31397}{31436}Unpleasant|character.
{31442}{31491}Oh, dear!
{31510}{31560}Dia?
{31569}{31608}Who are they?
{31670}{31683}Sagoths,
{31689}{31727}soldiers of|the Mahars.
{31733}{31778}Oh, and... and|pardon me,
{31784}{31824}what are|Mahars?
{31830}{31863}Mahars rule|Pellucidar,
{31869}{31927}and Sagoths take us|to be slaves in their city.
{31933}{31981}What a charming prospect.Dia.
{32056}{32101}Aghh!
{32117}{32155}Agh!
{32607}{32650}Dia!
{32693}{32715}Your act|of chivalry
{32721}{32772}didn't seem very|popular, David.
{33024}{33073}Ahhh!
{35652}{35686}Pardon me.
{35721}{35770}Doc!
{36061}{36067}David!
{36073}{36137}That must be|the city of the Mahars.
{36276}{36321}Oh! Do watch|that thing!
{36335}{36376}Ohh!
{36390}{36428}Uhh!
{36451}{36486}Oh, they're|so excitable,
{36492}{36527}like all|foreigners.
{36533}{36548}Dia.
{36554}{36600}Dia!
{36606}{36636}I just wanted|to ask her
{36642}{36666}how much|farther.
{36672}{36724}They're giving|us the cold shoulder, David.
{36730}{36758}We certainly|seem to have
{36764}{36808}blotted our|copybook somehow.
{36814}{36856}Ohh!
{37075}{37120}Ugh!
{37416}{37428}David,|I-I...
{37434}{37477}I'm sorry to|be a burden, but I...
{37483}{37534}I don't think|I can go on much longer.
{37540}{37550}Come on,|doc.
{37556}{37623}It can't be|much farther.
{37846}{37884}Oh!
{38582}{38634}Noisy lot, aren't they, David?
{38732}{38774}Ah.
{39018}{39042}Doc?
{39048}{39066}Mmm?
{39072}{39109}Dia...
{39115}{39131}Dia,|she's gone.
{39137}{39156}Uh?|She's not here?
{39162}{39189}Ghak,
{39198}{39269}what happened|to Dia?
{39302}{39349}Hoojah|the sly one.
{39355}{39409}He escaped|with the girl you refused.
{39416}{39468}I what?|You insulted Dia.
{39474}{39533}Do you not|know what you have done?
{39545}{39552}No.
{39558}{39597}When a man from|Pellucidar fights
{39603}{39639}with another man|for a woman,
{39645}{39700}she belongs|to he who wins.
{39714}{39757}Well, you should've|claimed her
{39763}{39784}or released her.
{39790}{39821}But you showed|contempt
{39827}{39873}for her by|doing nothing.
{39890}{39952}Now no man can|take her as mate
{39977}{40039}until he's overcome|you in combat.
{40126}{40141}I didn't know.
{40147}{40213}I-I thought I was|protecting her.
{40242}{40272}Forgive me,
{40284}{40334}for you could|not have known.
{40399}{40436}Dia was in hiding
{40449}{40483}from Jubal,
{40507}{40542}the ugly one.
{40579}{40596}He is a man with
{40602}{40661}the strength|of many men.
{40679}{40713}And he has made|it known that
{40719}{40775}he wants Dia|for his mate.
{40818}{40833}There is no one
{40839}{40873}who can defend|her against him,
{40879}{40929}and so Dia|fled to the hills.
{40965}{41039}Only to be captured|by a Sagoth raiding party.
{41161}{41233}There is something|you should know, my friend.
{41264}{41302}Dia is a princess,
{41347}{41384}the daughter|of kings.
{41448}{41476}She is proud
{41482}{41516}and she will|never forgive you,
{41522}{41564}even if you did|find her again,
{41570}{41623}which you will not.
{41644}{41701}We are all doomed|to slavery...
{41750}{41784}and death.
{42060}{42131}They are no respecters of age, are they?
{42412}{42421}David!
{42427}{42478}What a|phenomenal sight...
{42502}{42540}a fire|curtain!
{42572}{42621}Ooh!
{43935}{43990}Ugh!
{44734}{44771}David!|What?
{44777}{44807}A Rhamphorhynchus
{44813}{44862}of the middle|Jurassic period.
{45178}{45212}My goodness,|how enormous.
{45218}{45282}Why, the largest|remains we ever discovered
{45288}{45335}have never|indicated a size much greater
{45341}{45395}than that|attained by an ordinary crow.
{47590}{47607}Oh!|Hey!
{47613}{47647}What are|you doing?
{47653}{47671}Oh, oh!
{47677}{47710}Doc!
{48338}{48359}Oh!
{48365}{48374}Perry!
{48380}{48409}Take care|of yourself.
{48415}{48435}I will, and you.
{48441}{48496}You are beginning|to annoy me.
{49455}{49503}Ghak,|one at a time.
{49509}{49559}You've got|a long day.
{49740}{49759}Ahh!
{49765}{49813}Ah, there|you are, my friend.
{49819}{49872}Another one|for the shelves.
{49894}{49929}Thank you.
{49956}{50002}Now, what|have we got?
{50065}{50098}Hmm.
{50104}{50138}Fascinating.
{50171}{50215}"The Mahar...
{50221}{50258}"is limited...
{50264}{50311}"vocally...
{50369}{50418}"but has been...
{50453}{50498}"endowed...
{50504}{50524}"with...
{50530}{50562}"mesmeric powers...
{50568}{50627}"and a high degree|of telepathy."
{50645}{50661}Hmm.
{50667}{50707}That's quite|a combination,
{50713}{50761}for a bird.
{50912}{50945}I don't know|what it is
{50951}{50990}they're giving|us to eat.
{50996}{51047}Perhaps it's|just as well.
{51114}{51161}Doc?|Mm-hmm?
{51167}{51223}How do we|get out of here?
{51236}{51259}I really|haven't been
{51265}{51285}able to find|out anything
{51291}{51351}definite about the|Mahar's secret yet,
{51358}{51395}except that,
{51406}{51422}in some way,
{51428}{51474}it is connected|with the lava,
{51487}{51520}with the heat.
{51526}{51551}Well, I'm|certainly getting
{51557}{51575}to know|about that.
{51581}{51626}Ahh, but|that is the point, David.
{51632}{51649}Slaves are|used
{51655}{51681}to constantly|repair
{51687}{51729}and divert|the lava channels.
{51735}{51768}You see,|although the lava
{51774}{51792}is of vital|importance,
{51798}{51843}it is also|eating away at the very
{51849}{51895}foundations|of the Mahar city.
{51901}{51938}And so its|flow has to be
{51944}{51996}continually|checked and rechanneled.
{52002}{52055}In fact,|the whole safety of the city
{52061}{52113}is dependant|upon the slaves.
{52120}{52134}And, uh,|we are
{52140}{52190}among their|number now.
{52196}{52238}Oh, there's|cheerful Annie again.
{52244}{52309}Watch yourself,|doc.
{52339}{52370}Doc!
{61178}{61229}Yeah.
{61945}{61987}David.
{61993}{62020}D-David.
{62026}{62058}Ra.|Ra?
{62074}{62106}Hu-rrah.
{62247}{62284}Oh, uh...
{62304}{62358}I don't come|from Pellucidar.
{62368}{62411}I come from|another world.
{62508}{62532}I escaped
{62538}{62568}from the|Mahar city.
{62574}{62643}No one can escape|from the Mahar city.
{62668}{62693}The Mahars
{62699}{62737}are all-seeing,
{62743}{62794}all lethal.
{62810}{62818}Ra,
{62824}{62854}why haven't|you risen up
{62860}{62881}and fought|the Mahars?
{62887}{62935}You do not know|the Mahar.
{62944}{62957}You have not
{62963}{63001}really seen|their
{63007}{63044}power.
{63050}{63087}They're evil!
{63093}{63133}Hmm.
{63165}{63180}Ra,
{63186}{63252}if your tribe|and the others
{63258}{63287}joined together,
{63293}{63339}you could|defeat the Mahars.
{63345}{63390}It's good|thought.
{63418}{63455}But come|with me.
{63469}{63505}I'll show you.
{63520}{63559}Then you'll|understand.
{63807}{63845}Ra?
{63852}{63899}Where are you|taking me?
{64133}{64175}We are now|within the outer walls
{64181}{64212}of the|Mahar grotto.
{64218}{64262}We climb.
{64865}{64903}Ugh!
{65957}{66004}What are these|prisoners doing here?
{66011}{66058}Wait, and you|shall see.
{66078}{66114}You may be|thankful that you're not
{66120}{66184}on the same|side of the wall as they.
{66200}{66240}The Mahars.
{66459}{66502}Are you looking|for someone?
{66516}{66550}Yes.
{66556}{66594}Dia.
{67005}{67056}Thank god|she's not here.
{68603}{68637}Vile cr...
{69590}{69633}They've got|to be destroyed.
{69743}{69778}They've got|to be.
{69784}{69807}Come.
{69813}{69851}We go.
{73780}{73832}David.
{74308}{74330}I'm going back.
{74336}{74383}After what you've|just seen?
{74398}{74452}Especially after|what I've seen.
{74458}{74499}They've got|to be destroyed.
{74509}{74542}David,
{74548}{74600}you're|one man...
{74606}{74651}strong,|it's true.
{74710}{74751}How can|you win?
{74757}{74770}I've got to find
{74776}{74808}the secret|of the Mahars
{74814}{74853}and destroy|them.
{74939}{74970}I'll bring|Ghak back.
{74976}{75021}Ghak?
{75027}{75076}He will not|trust me.
{75082}{75130}No tribe trusts|each other.
{75223}{75267}I know.
{75446}{75515}You go back to|your village, Ra,
{75528}{75572}till the Sagoths|come again.
{75701}{75731}Do you think|I'll let
{75737}{75804}you go back alone?
{75871}{75918}You're a|friend, Ra.
{75924}{75951}Yes,
{75957}{76003}but foolish friend.
{76009}{76070}The Mahars will|make a meal of us.
{76097}{76156}We've just doubled|our strength.
{77336}{77389}It's...
{79972}{80009}David!
{80015}{80037}The ear.
{80043}{80092}Get it behind|the ear.
{80474}{80524}Ahh!
{80710}{80747}The ear!
{82528}{82568}Oh, no!
{83671}{83706}You got him!
{84235}{84280}Bravo!
{84314}{84349}David, above you!
{85240}{85275}Freedom!
{85406}{85442}Freedom!
{85504}{85538}Freedom! Freedom!
{85982}{86020}Come on, doc.
{86209}{86240}Get a tight hold,|doc.
{86246}{86266}I have a|firm grip
{86272}{86304}upon your|trousers, David.
{86310}{86323}David!|What?
{86329}{86367}I found it!|I found the Mahar secret!
{86373}{86401}Come with me.|Not now, doc!
{86407}{86452}But it's just through|this hidey-hole.
{86458}{86524}Come on, me boy,|I'll show you.
{87047}{87093}It's not far|now, David.
{87099}{87146}Be careful|of the edge.
{87399}{87466}It was the|most amazing piece of luck.
{87472}{87514}I practically|stumbled on it.
{87520}{87560}And after pondering|over all those
{87566}{87595}heavy slabs|in the library
{87601}{87648}and learning very|little from them,
{87654}{87703}I got so|dispirited.
{87713}{87723}I kept thinking,
{87729}{87763}"whatever will|I tell David
{87769}{87784}"when he|gets back?"
{87790}{87852}You knew I'd come|back for you, did you?
{87866}{87885}Of course I did.
{87891}{87963}What would I|do without you?
{88065}{88088}There...
{88094}{88132}there it is.
{88138}{88157}The very origin
{88163}{88226}of every Mahar|that's born.
{88232}{88264}Look, David.
{88270}{88315}Do you see|that winch?
{88321}{88350}That is what|controls
{88356}{88412}the fire curtain.
{88564}{88571}This is where
{88577}{88638}we're going|to finish them.
{89265}{89293}It's a|dead end, David.
{89299}{89324}Doc,|in here.
{89330}{89340}Down there?
{89346}{89376}But I'm not|a rabbit, you know.
{89382}{89413}Come on,|doc.
{89566}{89625}Fascinating|rock structure, David.
{89632}{89691}Would you|please, doc... come on!
{89706}{89713}Oh.
{89719}{89771}Oh, I I'll|just sit for a moment.
{89790}{89832}Alright.|Catch your breath.
{89852}{89900}I can't find|my marks.
{89906}{89913}David?
{89919}{89988}Have you ever|thought of going to the moon?
{90014}{90043}Hmm?
{90049}{90064}Come on,|doc.
{90070}{90125}Oh, uh,|wh-which way now?
{90187}{90230}I'm afraid we're lost, doc.
{90248}{90254}Be careful
{90260}{90298}not to graze|yourself on these
{90304}{90363}formidable-looking|rocks here.
{90404}{90437}Oh!
{90443}{90469}I say,
{90475}{90493}there's that...
{90499}{90560}peculiar pellucid|light ahead.
{90566}{90610}Shall we explore?
{90702}{90735}Whoops-a-daisy.
{90741}{90796}Here, doc.|Come on.
{90802}{90841}Watch|yourself.
{90847}{90903}Come on.
{91043}{91088}Oh!
{91094}{91140}Fresh air|at last.
{91206}{91226}David?
{91270}{91313}I'm so sorry,|dear fellow.
{91319}{91337}This place is apt
{91343}{91379}to make one|a little jumpy.
{91385}{91429}Here, sit down.
{91749}{91769}Dia!
{91775}{91824}Come, and I|kill her.
{91989}{92008}Dia!
{92014}{92050}Ahh! David!
{93196}{93228}Bull's-eye!
{93334}{93362}Dia?
{93368}{93377}No.
{93383}{93441}Dia, I thought|I'd never see you again.
{93457}{93507}Dia?
{93558}{93599}Be masterful,|David.
{93626}{93656}Dia?
{93662}{93688}Sit down!
{93694}{93724}Sit down!
{93730}{93756}Now, you listen|to me...
{93762}{93803}no, it's|too late now.
{93838}{93874}When we were|near my village,
{93880}{93897}I managed to escape
{93903}{93919}from Hoojah|the sly one.
{93925}{93966}And now I fear|that Hoojah the sly one
{93972}{94023}will lead Jubal|the ugly one back here.
{94029}{94062}I heard|about him.
{94068}{94095}David, he will|kill you.
{94101}{94134}He is the|strongest warrior
{94140}{94196}in all of|Pellucidar.
{94248}{94294}What, David?
{94429}{94453}The sooner|I meet up
{94459}{94491}with Jubal,|the better.
{94497}{94531}Come on.
{94537}{94556}Come on!
{94562}{94604}Watch your step, doc.
{94613}{94631}Oh, yes.
{94637}{94656}My word,
{94662}{94704}what a fiery|beastie.
{94770}{94801}Oh, your royal|highness,
{94807}{94867}how very nice|to see you again.
{94873}{94898}Remarkably|efficient,
{94904}{94943}these primitive|weapons.
{94949}{94971}I've never had|occasion
{94977}{94991}to use them|before.
{94997}{95053}Ha! The cord|from my spectacles.
{95089}{95106}Oh, y-your|tomahawk
{95112}{95178}came in very useful,|too, David.
{95184}{95235}Brains|before brawn, huh, doc?
{95243}{95266}Oh, a|combination
{95272}{95296}of both,|dear boy.
{95302}{95326}We must|hurry.
{95332}{95401}Yeah, I've|got to find the ugly one.
{95407}{95433}Wouldn't|exactly call
{95439}{95483}him very pretty,|would you?
{95489}{95557}Hey, David!|Wait for me!
{95615}{95638}It's Jubal
{95644}{95686}the ugly one!
{95746}{95772}You can say|that again.
{95778}{95799}Come,|we must hide.
{95805}{95864}No, no, Dia, no!|Come!
{95874}{95901}I'm gonna|have to fight
{95907}{95932}Jubal once|and for all.
{95938}{95964}Stand aside,|David.
{95970}{96029}Doc, I said|this is my fight.
{97438}{97493}Ohh!|David!
{97518}{97575}David...
{97858}{97910}Watch him,|David!
{98436}{98463}That's right,|David.
{98469}{98508}Dia.
{98552}{98582}No! No!
{98588}{98630}Unhand her,|you coward.
{98760}{98798}Aha!
{98840}{98903}Never mind|the Queensberry rules.
{99694}{99750}Well done,|David!
{99829}{99849}Now...
{99855}{99895}you scoundrel.
{100006}{100037}Missed.
{100043}{100066}Well,|at least we
{100072}{100101}put him to his|heels. Hmph!
{100107}{100138}Well done, David!
{100144}{100180}Such courage,|my boy!
{100186}{100241}Such great|courage!
{100247}{100297}David!
{100388}{100426}Jubal!
{100432}{100480}You have|defeated Jubal.
{100529}{100575}Dia is yours.
{100589}{100632}Dia will not|be mine
{100642}{100693}until we destroy|the Mahars
{100699}{100756}and free|Pellucidar.
{101111}{101146}Raise bows.
{101196}{101228}Take aim.
{101260}{101289}Fire!
{101344}{101371}Robin Hood|and his
{101377}{101436}merry men,|what, David?
{101649}{101677}Hear me,
{101683}{101746}leaders of the tribes|of Pellucidar.
{101769}{101803}These strangers
{101809}{101847}came to our world...
{101853}{101904}a world ruled|by the Mahars
{101910}{101939}who have enslaved
{101945}{101995}and tortured us.
{102001}{102059}For as long as|we can recall...
{102065}{102132}our tribes|have been divided.
{102145}{102180}Now,
{102186}{102210}with the help
{102216}{102266}of our new-found|friends
{102272}{102294}we are united.
{102300}{102329}And we have|the strength
{102335}{102350}and the power
{102356}{102406}to destroy once|and for all
{102412}{102474}those who have|enslaved us.
{102493}{102510}Death
{102516}{102569}to the Mahars!
{102988}{103012}Well, David,|would you like
{103018}{103077}to summarize|our deployment?
{103126}{103183}I will lead|the main attack.
{103191}{103217}Ghak,|and his men
{103223}{103267}will cover|the rear.
{103273}{103308}Ra and|Dr. Perry
{103314}{103369}will go ahead|of us
{103375}{103407}through the|lava channel
{103413}{103455}to the inner|sanctum
{103461}{103476}and cut off
{103482}{103521}the main fire|supply.
{103527}{103561}I hate to ask you|to do this, doc,
{103567}{103619}but you know where|the controls are.
{103625}{103643}I'm delighted|to be
{103649}{103693}of some active|service, my boy.
{103699}{103728}Don't you|worry, David.
{103734}{103785}I will take|good care of him.
{103791}{103833}Oh, most|kind.
{103839}{103855}Well,
{103861}{103917}meeting|adjourned, gentlemen.
{103974}{104005}I go with|you, yes?
{104011}{104051}No, Dia.|No.
{104057}{104109}Why not,|David?
{104134}{104146}Dia,
{104152}{104195}the Mahar city is|no place for you.
{104295}{104350}David...|Dia.
{105879}{105894}Ah!
{105900}{105954}This|is it.
{105992}{106018}I must|warn you,
{106024}{106086}it gets very|hot in there.
{107149}{107209}Deuced hot!
{107548}{107606}You could roast|an ox in here.
{108147}{108161}Got you,|you bounder!
{108219}{108246}Oh, I do beg|your pardon,
{108252}{108273}your royal|highness.
{108279}{108335}I-I thought you|were the enemy.
{108341}{108355}No.|Dia,
{108361}{108398}what are you|doing here?
{108404}{108415}It's Hoojah...
{108421}{108471}he has been captured|by the Sagoths.
{108509}{108540}He might|betray us.
{108546}{108578}The traitorous|blighter!
{108584}{108625}What a pity my|arrow missed him.
{108631}{108672}Oh, well.|Quickly, fall in.
{108678}{108703}Follow me. Right.
{108709}{108768}Single file.
{109401}{109436}Retreat!
{109578}{109640}Ra, the|inner sanctum!
{115969}{116018}You cannot|mesmerize me!
{116024}{116099}I'm British!
{116824}{116838}Dia!
{116844}{116875}Dia! Perry!
{117251}{117293}Dia!
{118805}{118848}Dia!
{118905}{118949}Doc!
{119330}{119378}Dia!
{120230}{120277}David!
{120537}{120586}David!
{120798}{120847}Ahh, David!
{121013}{121060}David!
{121126}{121161}Doc,|you're limping!
{121167}{121187}Oh, it's|my brolly!
{121193}{121255}Come on, doc,|hurry up!
{122048}{122078}Come on, doc!
{122084}{122135}Here,|David, here!
{122212}{122240}Come on!
{122246}{122294}Keep going,|doc.
{122402}{122428}Dia.
{122434}{122489}Perry, this way.
{122755}{122797}Wh-why have you stopped?
{122803}{122847}We must|wait for Ra!
{122853}{122879}Oh, yes!
{122885}{122919}Ra!
{122925}{122985}Ra!|It's too late.
{123015}{123053}Come on!
{123363}{123401}Dia.
{123414}{123451}Doc.
{123474}{123509}Doc...
{123515}{123553}Ra!
{124477}{124506}Poor Ra.
{124512}{124538}Yes, indeed.
{124544}{124601}A brave man.
{124816}{124878}Come on, doc.
{125127}{125147}Ah, here's David
{125153}{125204}and his|lovely lady.
{125210}{125266}Good-bye!
{125339}{125393}People of|Pellucidar,
{125404}{125469}according to|your custom,

{125617}{125671}to be my bride.
{125813}{125851}No, David.
{125857}{125916}It's not to be.
{125994}{126026}I must stay here.
{126032}{126077}This is my world.
{126092}{126154}I would be lost|in yours.
{126160}{126167}No.

{126782}{126839}God bless you.
{128185}{128236}David?
Piedmont, New Mexico.
Population 68.
Come on.
I didn't notice them before.
That's crazy. I didn't know buzzards fly at night.
That's what they look like.
Here.
Boy, that's some dead burg.
Buzzards only come when something's dead.
I guess we'd better go in and have a look.
'This is Caper One to Vandal Deca.
'Caper One to Vandal Deca.
Are you reading? Over.'
Yes, I'm reading. Over.
'We're about to enter the town of Piedmont and recover the satellite.'
Very good, Caper One.
Leave your radio open.
'Roger.
'We're now inside the town.
'It's kinda spooky.
'I see a church steeple ahead on the left.
'It's quiet here.
'It's the damndest thing.
There's no sign of life.
'The signals from the satellite are getting very strong.'
- 'Sir! You see that, Lieutenant?'
- 'See what, Crane?'
'Over by the fence.
It looks like a body.'
'Easy, Crane.
You're imagining things.'
- 'Holy...'
- 'Sir, it's another one.'
'You're right.
Looks dead.'
- 'Yes, sir, shall I...'
- 'No! Stay in the van.'
Vandal Deca to Caper One.
What's happened?
'We see bodies, lots of them.'
Are you certain, Caper One?
'Dammit, Comroe, of course we're certain.'
Your orders are...
"Proceed to satellite and retrieve."
'Roger, Vandal Deca.'
Stay at your stations!
Hit that security button!
Get me Major Manchek.
'Somehow they don't hardly look dead, Lieutenant.'
'They're all over the place.
Must be dozens of them.'
Dammit, get this call through!
'It's sort of like they just dropped in their tracks, sir.
'Sir!'
'Good chri...!'
- 'Do you see that thing in white?'
- 'Yeah, it's coming toward us.'
Hello, Major.
This may sound crazy, but there's something strange going on with Caper One.
'Lieutenant, sir,
I think we should get out of...'
Hello, ops, this is Major Manchek.
Scoop control A-12.
We need a flyby over Piedmont,
New Mexico.
Infrared. A F.L.I.R. scan, all sectors.
Film to come direct to Scoop.
Assign Gunnar Wilson, if he's not crocked someplace.
Jeez!
I'm declaring a state of emergency.
All personnel restricted to base.
Everything seen and heard in that room is top secret.
Yes, sir.
'This is a recording.
'State your name and your message and hang up.'
Major Arthur Manchek,
Scoop mission control A-12.
I recommend calling a Wildfire alert.
We have evidence here on film of unnatural death caused by Scoop 7 returning to Earth.
Time check 0-1-4-7 inclusive.
We'd like to see
Dr. Jeremy Stone, please.
Well, I'm Mrs. Stone, and we are having a party.
May I...
Does that man have a gun?
Ma'am, we must see Dr. Stone.
- What is this?
- Please call Dr. Stone to the door.
Otherwise we'll go get him, ma'am.
Just a minute.
I'll just wait here, ma'am.
I'll come to Berkeley anytime, Stone.
That $4 million must be the largest federal grant.
May I see you, Jeremy?
The S.D.S. has arrived no doubt.
Jeremy, there are some army types in the hall, and there are two more outside with guns.
They want to see you.
I'll take care of it.
Jeremy! If you knew about this, you might've told...
I didn't.
I'll explain later.
I'm Dr. Stone.
Yes. I'm Captain Morton.
There's a fire, sir.
- I've got to leave.
- For God's sakes, Jeremy!
- When will you be back?
- I'm not sure.
The guns, is it...
Mrs. Stone, it's our job to protect your husband.
From now on, nothing must be allowed to happen to him.
I'll be safe as in your arms.
Jeremy? Jeremy!
You tell the Senator it's his daughter!
- 'Allison?'
- Dad?
Dad, something very peculiar has just happened, even for Jeremy.
A few minutes ago...
Dad, are you there?
What's going on?
'This communication is being monitored.
'The connection has been broken for reasons of national security.
'You will be briefed at the appropriate time.
'Thank you for your cooperation,
Mrs. Stone.'
I feel like Onassis.
It was the fastest thing we could arrange, sir.
Thanks. Yes?
General Sparks here.
I just wanted to inform you that all members of your team have been cleared and are now being called in.
Except for professor Kirke.
He's in the hospital. Appendectomy.
You'll get complete details on everything when your team is assembled.
You don't make sense.
You talk like you've been brainwashed.
You don't understand.
Germ warfare people, Dad?
- A lab accident?
- Thank you.
It's different this time. Don't pack, Claire,
I won't need anything.
A hippie.
He's going to a love-in.
I give up.
One minute you're fed up.
You talk about retiring... to Alaska yet!
Now you've turned into a cloak-and-dagger man.
- My glasses.
- Here they are, Dad.
Can't you at least tell me who phoned at this ungodly hour?
Grandpa, there's a car, and they got guns.
Do they now?
Oh, that's serious.
- I'll watch out.
- Honey, you've been dreaming.
I wish I were!
No.
Uh-uh.
Get someone else.
Dr. Leavitt,
I told you, there's a fire!
My experiment's at the critical stage.
I've been working around the clock.
I can't just leave now.
I want that new plate read as soon as it's developed.
Yes, ma'am.
My orders come from Dr. Robertson, the President's science advisor in Washington.
There's a phone.
Pick it up. Call Robbie.
Tell him I burnt my draft card.
Are you sick, ma'am?
We have a physician on call.
All Dr. Leavitt needs is rest.
Oh, knock it off, Bess.
If the physician certifies that you are unable to continue...
No!
I'm fine.
Relax.
I'm going with you.
Skin knife.
'Hold it, Mark.
Sorry to disturb you.
'There's just been a call from a Dr. Robertson at the White House.
'Your orders are to break scrub.'
Orders?
I've got a patient all ready.
'Kelly will take over for you.
'It's all arranged. You're expected in the surgeon's room in 30 seconds.'
Are you sure the satellite isn't radioactive?
No. Manchek showed me the telemetry reports.
Presumably, it could be some form of space germ.
Presumably this stuff is nonporous.
Why did you pick me?
You're an M.D., a talented surgeon who knows blood chemistries, and you're single, the "odd man hypothesis".
What the hell is that?
Didn't you read the Wildfire material
I've been sending you?
Very little. I never went in much for science fiction.
Nor do I!
It seems to me, General,
Dr. Stone put one over on you.
In fact, he made us all think his Wildfire lab could handle any contamination from outer space.
I disagree with the Senator from Vermont.
Dr. Stone, a Nobel Prize winner, twice President of the
National Academy of Sciences, is well known here in Washington.
Is the implication that
Dr. Stone deliberately misled us?
Perhaps not deliberately, Senator.
I'm reasonably certain that before the night the Wildfire team was mobilized,
Dr. Stone didn't know Scoop existed.
- I'm astounded.
- Reasons of national security.
Very smart.
We've had experiences with scientists before.
Now, let's talk about this famous letter
Dr. Stone sent to the President some two years ago.
From what you're saying, General, it was just a shot in the dark?
Perhaps that's a little unfair, Senator.
Dr. Stone and I were consultants with NASA on the lunar receiving lab.
He wasn't completely satisfied with that.
He felt a more advanced lab was required.
You mean more expensive, don't you?
I call that Dr. Stone's $90 million mash note to Uncle Sam.
"In a true biological crisis
"which our exploration of space could bring about,
"the present lunar receiving laboratory might prove inadequate.
"I therefore urge the establishment of a facility
"to deal specifically with an extraterrestrial form of life.
"The purpose of this facility would be to limit
"the dissemination of such an unknown organism from outer space,
"and to provide laboratories for its analysis.
"I recommend that this facility be located
"In an uninhabited region of the United States,
"that it utilize all known isolation techniques,
"and that it be equipped with a nuclear device for self-destruction
"in the event of an emergency.
"Yours very truly, Jeremy Stone."
Don't encourage the President to think scientists are wizards, Jeremy.
If things get out of control, and they might, even you can't work miracles.
I'd expect to have your help, Charlie.
Piedmont approaching, gentlemen.
Go over and give us a look first, Dempsey.
I was afraid of that.
The birds'll eat the infected flesh, and then fly off and spread the disease.
If it is a disease.
Drop the gas canisters, Dempsey.
Someone's supposed to be alive down there!
Somebody did something.
That's for sure.
Let's give it a double dose.
That gas will only kill the birds.
OK, Dempsey, hover over the main street and drop the ladder.
- Do not attempt to land. Is that clear?
- Roger. Clearer all the time.
When we climb down, lift off to 1,000 feet and hover at a safe distance.
And come back when we signal.
If anything happens to us, you have your orders.
Yes, sir. Proceed directly to Wildfire and then...
If we're eliminated, the aircraft and pilot will have to be sterilized.
Wait a minute!
That's not what they told me.
Just incinerated.
Coronary?
I doubt it.
Hall!
Take a look at this.
Are you sure that isn't coronary?
No, coronary's painful.
They should grimace.
If it was fast, they wouldn't have time.
Fast? These people were cut down in mid-stride.
Up there! Look.
An air force jet.
If we don't make it to Wildfire, he'll see the helicopter does or shoot it down.
Well, for Dempsey's sake, we'd better not slip up.
"The day of judgment is at hand.
"Have mercy on my soul and to hell with all the others. Amen."
Senile.
This took time! Regardless of what made her do it, it took time.
There's a chance someone's still alive.
I wouldn't believe you could commit suicide that way.
Most of them died instantly, but a few had time to go quietly nuts.
Let's find the damn satellite.
This injury, there isn't any bleeding.
A cut like this, torn veins, broken capillaries - it should bleed like hell.
Yes.
There's no blood on any of them.
Even where it's chewed, no bleeding.
Hold it, hold it!
You'd better back up.
We gotta go to the... left.
We're damn close.
Bear right.
I'll bet they took it to the doctor.
There it is.
The damn fool opened it!
Yeah, every country doctor should run his office like the lunar lab.
The capsule first, Hall.
We've got about
40 minutes of oxygen left.
Have a look at his buttocks.
- That's not funny.
- Not meant to be.
Normally blood in a dead person goes to the lowest points.
There should be marks of lividity.
Do you see purplish marks on his butt?
No.
Careful you don't puncture your suit.
Clotted blood!
Powdered!
I'll be damned!
No wonder they didn't bleed.
It's clotted throughout the entire system.
Five quarts of blood turned to powder!
In theory, I suppose, a single organism could do it.
But, in fact, there isn't an organism on Earth...
You mean there didn't used to be.
- I don't...
- We heard it alright.
Go away! Go back!
- Get back! Get outta here.
- Go back!
Get away!
This must be the mother.
He's scared and hungry as hell.
Can't be more than six months old.
- There's probably a formula in the kitchen.
- Don't feed it!
He hasn't eaten in at least 12 hours!
We don't do anything until we get that kid into a controlled situation.
Maybe feeding is part of the disease process.
Maybe those who hadn't eaten yet lasted longest.
Whatever it is, with our oxygen running out, we can't take a chance.
Oh, wait a minute.
This is a major break... a survivor.
Too bad he can't tell us what happened.
Maybe he can... if he lives.
You!
You... You did it!
Give me that knife.
You're not human.
Everybody's dead.
What happened?
What is it?
What's happened?
The town is finished, contaminated beyond all...
Careful, sir.
This is an open transmission.
I'm aware of that, Manchek.
Order up a 7-12.
- Only the President...
- Precisely. Get on it.
The town must be neutralized immediately.
Has the President made his decision on directive 7-12 yet?
He doesn't jump into things,
Dr. Robertson.
First I've got to put together a briefing for him.
The President's main concern is the international consequences.
What do you think, Mr. Secretary?
It's against the Moscow Treaty of 1963 to fire thermonuclear weapons above ground.
The Russians will have to be privately informed we're going to cauterize the area.
Then they'll ask a flock of questions.
Some we don't want answered.
That'll take hours.
God knows how far the infection can spread in that time.
Yes, Chief?
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. President.
The President's decided to postpone directive 7-12 for 24 to 48 hours.
But...
Instead he'll call out the National Guard to cordon off the area around Piedmont.
- That's your department, Ed.
- Safe and sound.
It should've been left up to the scientists.
It's a colossal mistake.
Tell the President I said so.
No, but...
I'll get you an appointment.
By whose decision, General, was the site for Wildfire chosen?
Largely Dr. Stone's.
It seemed ideal to him because of its remoteness.
There was no inhabited area near Wildfire for a radius of 112 miles.
Las Vegas is to the north,
Phoenix to the south,
Los Angeles, west.
Weren't you worried the infection might spread to them?
Yes, sir, I was.
But Dr. Stone and Dr. Robertson assured the President
Wildfire was foolproof because of its device for atomic self-destruct.
The military had to take a backseat.
At least they could've sent a licensed driver to meet me at that crummy airstrip.
They keep personnel to a minimum for obvious reasons.
You're lost! No one's been down this goat path for years.
That's how it's supposed to look.
They spent $50,000 on it.
Putting in the potholes?
Getting rid of the tread marks.
Those big tractors leave a lasting impression.
A lot of heavy equipment has passed this way.
Where's our leader?
We'll catch up to him and Hall very soon now.
Why'd they pick Hall? He's no scientist.
Who needs an overpriced M.D.?
Relax and enjoy your cigarette.
It's your last.
It starts here.
It's a great place to grow pot.
Just a plain old crop of barley.
Still, it is rather clever, I think.
- Something wrong?
- I never liked red lights.
Reminds me of my years in a bordello.
Howdy.
Howdy-doo-dee.
You got the time?
My watch stopped at 11:46.
- Darn shame.
- Must be the heat.
It's no fake, believe me.
When I retire, I'd like an agricultural station like this in Alaska.
- You, a sourdough?
- The sourest.
This way.
Step in.
Cute.
The whole thing.
What a world we're making.
I can see why the kids are dropping out.
We should've.
It's an emergency, Dutton.
We got tagged. Period.
Till I saw those photos from Vandenberg, I...
- They brought it on themselves.
- Who?
The people in Piedmont?
What you said before, you don't believe the infection in that capsule was brought back deliberately, do you?
Skip it, skip it. I hope
I'm talking through my hat.
Put your hands on that glass, palms down.
It's a finger and palm print analyzer. It...
...reads a composite of 10,000 dermatographic lines.
How'd you know that?
Oh, Dutton,
I have a long criminal record.
Then you're in trouble.
This machine has a long memory.
It gives you final clearance to enter Wildfire.
'Isothermal reading for M.C. levels 4 and 5
'is Z.B. and R.A. over 2.9.'
- How's Piedmont?
- I had to order up a 7-12.
- How are you, Ruth?
- Hello.
- No other way to halt the infection spread.
- Oh.
You two know each other, don't you?
By reputation only.
Yes, up to now we've had to worship from afar.
Be good, Ruth.
Any messages for me from the White House?
Not a thing, Dr. Stone, or you'd have it.
- No personal messages?
- No, ma'am.
Nothing from Dr. Robertson?
Are you sure, Sergeant?
Dr. Stone, sir,
I have one thing to do. Just one.
Everything else is fully automatic, computerized and self-regulating.
I listen for a little bell in here.
Ding-a-ling. That means a message coming in is for the Wildfire team.
Precisely! An M.C.N. communication.
I'm expecting one.
Yes, sir! Top priority.
Ding-a-ling.
I push a button, and all five level control centers are notified the same time you are.
The bell hasn't rung, sir.
Thanks for the tour, Sergeant.
Dr. Dutton. Thank you.
Will you follow me, Dr. Leavitt?
- And may I have your glasses, please?
- What for?
They'll be treated and returned to you, Doctor.
Well, they'd better be, or I'll need a white cane.
Who picked Leavitt?
Talk about the odd man hypothesis, which we haven't yet.
She's really an odd ball.
We're lucky to have her.
She's the best-equipped of us to double up for Kirke in microbiology.
'When dressed, the team will proceed directly to conference room 7.'
Keep this with you at all times.
What's it for?
You're the odd man.
The key man, quite literally.
This other key, and Wildfire itself, depend on your key.
Wildfire's equipped with a nuclear device for self-destruct.
In an emergency, it's activated automatically.
I've just inserted the key in the main station that arms the mechanism.
The device is ready for detonation.
- When?
- Never, we hope.
It only goes off if there's danger of infection breaking out from here.
That silver key can't be removed.
You're the only one who can disarm the mechanism by inserting your red key
In one of the substations located throughout the facility.
Now, there's a five-minute delay between the time detonation locks in and the bomb explodes.
That gives you a chance to think and... please God, call it off.
- Look, I'm the new boy here. Why me?
- Because you're single!
You should have done your homework, sport.
Page 255,
Robbie's odd man hypothesis.
"Results of testing confirm the Robertson odd man hypothesis:
"That an unmarried male should carry out command decisions
"involving thermonuclear destruct contexts."
Let me take a look at that.
It's of vital importance, Hall, that you always know where you are in relation to the nearest substation.
To do that, you have to be familiar with the entire facility.
It can be studied on this electronic diagram which rotates to afford an overall view, or can be stopped at any section.
Detailed plans of the various levels and labs are also stored in the system.
We're on level 1 of a five-story cylindrical underground structure surrounded by solid rock.
Each level has three substations indicated by the yellow lights.
In the event the nuclear device is triggered, you can still cancel self-destruct by inserting your red key in a substation.
After our last simulation run, we decided to add two more substations per level, but they're not finished yet, so don't confuse them with functioning ones.
At the bottom of the central core is the apparatus for self-destruct.
Each level is a different color, based on a navy study of the psychological effects of color in environments.
Also, each level is bio-medically cleaner than the one above it.
We don't want anything to contaminate a possible organism.
That would make it twice as hard to isolate and characterize.
It'll take us 16 hours to descend through the programmed decontamination procedures on the first four levels, to level 5 where the main labs are.
Where exactly are we now?
There's one way you can always locate yourself or any of us instantly.
Simply by calling up projections from the electronic diagram on any video monitor anywhere in Wildfire.
Views such as this.
Now, this shows we're in conference room 7, level 1.
Each of us is indicated by our initial.
Our movements are continuously monitored on the electronic diagram.
Where are the patients?
Where's the capsule?
The patients are the yellow X's.
The red circle is the capsule.
On level 5, the patients and capsule will be isolated in biologically secure setups.
Are you sure the old man and the baby are still alive?
What are their chances, Hall?
Uncertain.
I'm hoping the intravenous dextrose and saline will hold them until we get to them.
We start decontamination and immunization procedures now.
You really expect me to fire the thing?
I'm afraid you don't understand.
All you can do is stop it.
In a biological emergency, the bomb is activated automatically.
It'll then go off within five minutes unless you get to a substation and lock in your key.
Oh.
'Delta five to all levels.
'We are checking out ray band emergency communications.
'This is a test.
'Proceed to infrared radiation decontamination room 1-d.'
Also it could be an organism from another planet released deliberately.
To wipe us out?
Really, Charles!
Just the opposite.
To make friendly contact.
A kind of messenger to show us life exists elsewhere in the universe.
It could be benign in its own environment.
Pretty far-fetched.
We can't ignore any possibility.
'You are about to undergo long-wave radiation.
'A buzzer will sound.
'Close your eyes and stand still or blindness may result.'
We faced quite a problem.
How to disinfect the human body, one of the dirtiest things in the known universe.
That is without killing the human being at the same time.
It gets tougher as we go.
Hard on the taxpayers, the way we burn up uniforms.
They're paper.
- I'd swear it was cloth.
- New process.
Where's the next substation, Hall?
Left of elevator on level 2.
Right. Across the corridor from body analysis, our next port of call.
Not for my alabaster body.
I mean it, Stone. You can take your body analyzer and you can...
'Sit down, please.
'Please look at the screen in front of you.
'Please place your body so that all points are obliterated.
'That is fine. We may proceed.
'State your name for the records.
Surname first.'
Mark Hall.
Hall, Mark.
'Thank you for your cooperation.'
Yes, dear.
'Please answer the following questions, yes or no.
- 'Have you any allergies?'
- Yes, to ragweed pollen.
OK, I'll repeat for your memory cells...
'Please repeat your response for our memory cells.'
Ragweed pollen!
'This ends the formal questioning.
Please undress.
'This is a scan for fungal lesions.'
'Dr. Stone, this is level 2 control.
The answer is affirmative.
'Major Manchek contacted the White House at 11:23 our time this morning.'
'Contact on all leads is "r" for ready.
'Do not be nervous.'
I'm not nervous.
'Physical parameters are being measured.
'There's no need to be nervous,
Dr. Leavitt.'
'Please raise your left arm.
'Please sit up, facing the scan screen and watch carefully.
'You have received pneumatic injections of booster immunizations.
'You may get dressed.
Thank you.
'This recording is now ended.'
That body analyzer!
I want to be there when the A.M.A. gets wind of it.
So far it's only been used by NASA to diagnose astronauts in space.
You doctors better start making house calls again.
'This is a xenon lamp apparatus.
'To insure complete effectiveness, spread your feet apart.
'To protect scalp and facial hair,
'place the metal helmet securely on the head.
'Make sure the helmet is firmly seated and the visor lowered.
'Then raise your arms and wait.'
'You may now remove helmet.
'You will notice a fine white ash on your body.
'This is the outer epithelial layers of your skin that have been burned away.
'Please replace the helmet in compartment
'and proceed through shower in next room.
'Then you may dress and descend to level 4.'
We're required to rest for six hours on level 4 after exposure to the xenon lamp.
So go to your rooms and sleep.
At the end of the corridor is the cafeteria.
We'll meet there at 0400 hours tomorrow.
'Pharmacology to maintenance L.B.
'One of our R.S. shows six points over normal and pressure 3.'
'Watchdog to all levels.
Scoop 7 capsule secure.
'Bio-check 66 plus 9 minus 0-5.'
'Leo control to Keepsake 5.
'The pressure integrity check runs 2.54 g-cm to the second.
'Please confirm.'
'A new form of life.
'Like Rudolph Karp's bacteria.'
Fools!
They refuse to believe life exists in meteorites.
I showed them at the Astrophysics conference what I just showed you.
But no, even with a microscope, they're blind.
What do I have to do?
Hit them over the head?
I'm glad you're amused, gentlemen, but it might just turn out to be true.
During this symposium, we'll discuss the possibility that intelligent life on a distant planet may be no larger than a flea.
Perhaps no larger than a bacterium.
'Time to wake up, sir.
'Time to wake up, sir!'
Hello?
'Time to wake up, sir.'
Who are you?
'Time to wake up, sir.
'Do you wish something, sir?'
Your name.
'Will that be all, sir?'
For the moment.
'This is the answering service supervisor.
'We wish you'd adopt a more serious attitude, Dr. Hall.'
Sorry, her voice is quite luscious.
'The voice belongs to Miss Gladys Stevens who is 63 years old.
'She lives in Omaha
'and makes her living taping messages for voice-reminder systems.'
Much obliged.
Let's not get sidetracked on Rudolph Karp and his meteorite theories.
His technique was worthless!
- I still think we should contact him.
- Fair enough. Where is he?
Behind the Iron Curtain.
He couldn't get a research grant here.
'H.P. Nutrient now available in the cafeteria
'for staff members from sectors 1 through 6.'
Hemlock!
All for you, Hippocrates.
Not your own venom?
Tastes like orange juice.
Nutrient 42-5.
Developed for the astronauts.
Eight ounces satisfy all daily nutritional requirements.
Except coffee.
And lipid soluble vitamins.
For that we have these.
Help yourself.
So what's the point of the cafeteria?
Wildfire isn't always on crash status.
Maybe there's some sugar.
Nope. Nothing that might provide a bacterial growth medium.
Precisely.
No sugar in the gut.
I'd like a cigarette right now.
- It's after meals you really miss 'em.
- You should have no trouble on level 5.
You won't even get this close to a meal.
We'll be entirely on high-protein nutrients.
I planned our work in three stages.
One, detection.
First step is to confirm that an organism is present.
Two, characterization.
How's it structured, how does it work?
Three, control.
How to contain and exterminate?
Jeremy, on this matter of extermination, we should go slowly.
Without ever realizing it, we might destroy a highly intelligent form of life.
Why don't we get going?
I've got two patients down there.
The team has two subjects.
They're not guinea pigs!
'You may now proceed to level 5, gentlemen.'
Um, stop by your rooms and insert these before taking the elevator.
I have risked drowning in that foul bath.
I have been parboiled, irradiated and xenon flashed.
- And now you suggest I...
- I have to!
We haven't done anything about the G.I. tract yet.
On level 5 we must be as nearly germ free as possible.
Anyone care to join me for a smoke?
'Watchdog to level 2, sector D.
'You are Red Kappa Phoenix status.'
Off the main corridor on the outer rim are the main living quarters, conference room, cafeteria, bio-safety maintenance, etc.
Inside are the labs.
Where is the library?
No need for books.
Everything's in the computer.
Notice the capsule has already been delivered by the sterile conveyor system to the main control lab here.
Your patients are here in the hot room of miscellaneous.
We can't have any direct contact with them.
Poor souls.
'Dr. Dutton and Dr. Hall are wanted in main control immediately.'
Hey!
If the patients are sealed off, how do I get to them?
- Ever used a glove box?
- No.
Wildfire's gone a step further.
Whole rooms that operate like glove boxes.
You'll be working in one shortly.
'Level 5 to Watchdog.
'We have a magnetic "K" indices here.
'Give us a code 3 when you get it.'
I wanted you here while we find out if there's anything still biologically active in the capsule.
Suggestions?
- Use a buffalo.
- Audio.
'Detectors "E" through "G" correction.
'Negative "N" scan.
Negative "N" scope in LY-1.
'Affirmative. "N" indicator in MP-4.
I will repeat.
'Negative "N" scan.
Negative "N" scope in LY-1.
'Affirmative.
"N" indicator in MP-4.'
Whatever killed them at Piedmont is still there and still as potent as ever.
If potent's the word.
Let's try a rhesus.
Yeah. We'll want a postmortem on it anyway.
'Housekeeping to level 5.
'Clean sweep schedule B now in effect.
'Germ-free animal technicians, please consult schedule A.'
So, OK.
Isolate and identify.
Right. You and I'll scan the capsule, Ruth.
Charlie, you work on these in autopsy.
Open the S.L., Ruth.
'Adjust S.Y. system for aseptricity as follows.
'Points 2-a at 5.
'Points 9 through 12 at plus 1.
'Plus 3, plus 6 at minus.'
Run an initial vector study, Charlie.
Find out how the disease enters the body.
- Charlie?
- Yes.
Yes, the vector study first, then autopsy.
Incredible.
Dutton, be careful.
Let our distinguished surgeon handle the knife.
Fine, but not for a while.
First, I'm a pediatrician and a geriatrist.
Take it easy.
Charlie will have a technician.
What's been done for them?
Just plasma for the old man, dextrose for the baby.
- Your therapy?
- No.
Medcom's.
Do I call you Miss Medcom?
If you like, Dr. Hall.
My name's Karen Anson.
Good! I couldn't cope with two machines.
How does this work?
You're lucky. Medcom's got one of the best minds here.
It's a medical data analyzer that can diagnose as well as prescribe.
It's hooked up to the main computer on level 1.
Every console and instrument in Wildfire is plugged into the main computer on a time-sharing basis.
All our key lab studies are done on automated machines.
I prefer the personal touch.
It's hard to come by in those suits.
Have you worked in them?
Not for real. But I've been drilling for three months.
Thank God for an expert.
This sort of thing's new to me.
It's new to all of us.
Until now,
Wildfire's been like a game.
We've even had simulation biowar games here.
With live subjects, volunteers.
I mean, I'm scared.
I never believed this could really happen.
Well, it has happened.
I'll need some lab tests.
Use this to check off what you want.
Just touch the pen to the screen.
You draw the bloods,
I'll do the physicals.
Use the bar.
The tunnel seals off automatically behind you.
The only way you might possibly break your suit is with a scalpel, and a surgeon isn't likely to do that.
'Bio-safety to S.L.
An animal in airlock 0-9-5.
'Re-confirm red R.D.P. status before transfer.'
Second scan completed.
Score, nothing to nothing.
Go to 100 power.
No, Ruth.
Use only one microscanner.
You being paid by the hour?
We could cover the capsule in one half the time.
There's less chance of missing something when we both concentrate on one screen.
Let's go directly to the inside.
We can assume they put the scoop on the thing to scoop something into it.
Brother, they sure got what they were looking for.
We're not here to make accusations.
We have a job to do purely as scientists.
Maybe not so pure.
Continue the scan, Ruth, on the outside.
No, don't do that.
We'll use the hands.
Nothing can happen, sir.
I'm faster than the hands.
I want you out of the hot room.
'B.Z. Doris to I.Z. Alice.
'S.D.T. energy output is 1.8,
3.0 joules,
'with rate two to three milliradians.
'And we still need those blankets.'
No sweat, sir.
Those cages are airtight.
I wish you would sweat a little more, Toby.
Sweat is a safeguard against some kinds of bacteria and carelessness.
Use the hands.
Wow!
Transmitted by air, as we thought.
Now we've got to determine its size.
Could be a gas or some kind of a virus.
We'll use a hundred angstrom filter to begin.
About the size of a small virus.
All systems go, sir.
Whatever it is, it's larger than a virus.
We'll try one micron filter.
Hang in there, baby.
It must be pretty big.
I'm gonna get me a fly swatter.
Do that.
Here goes with two microns.
Uh-huh.
Nasty.
At least we'll be able to get a good look at it.
Dutton to Stone.
We've just found out its size: about two microns in diameter.
Big enough to be a complete cell.
Interesting.
There's a good chance it's alive.
Airborne transmission?
Yes. What have you found?
So far nothing.
Our Nobel laureate here won't scan on the inside because he says...
Alright, Ruth.
Thanks, Charlie.
Keep at it.
It's pointless to go on scanning outside.
If it's two microns in diameter, it would've showed up at 440.
True, but we didn't know that before, did we?
We'll start with five power on the inside.
Stick to established procedure.
Establishment gonna fall down and go boom.
Switch to manual, Ruth.
The interior's too irregular to probe on automatic.
More light, huh?
Here's his blood value now.
Half normal.
Severely anemic.
Wake up, sir.
Can you hear me?
What's your name?
- J-Jackson.
- What?
Jackson.
Stay awake, Mr. Jackson.
Stay awake!
Tongue blade.
'Sixty-eight degrees on 1-4-0-7.
'Sixty-one on 1-2-0-3.
'Loss rate is minus 0-0-12.
'Please copy and confirm all receiving locks.'
- You can tell you're a bachelor.
- What was that?
I didn't say anything.
We're doing an isotope scan, Hall.
How the bugs get into the body.
Thought you should watch it.
I assume it was inhaled.
Not likely it's absorbed through the skin.
That's what we'll find out now: the mechanism of death.
We'll look at a replay of that at speed 6.
That tells us what we want to know, Hall.
The organism is inhaled.
The clotting begins in the lungs and spreads outward.
I didn't think it possible.
I didn't think the total volume of blood could solidify that fast.
I'd hoped maybe one crucial clot might form in the brain, which was what made them go insane.
And then the rest of the blood clot more slowly.
We'd have a chance to cure that.
Cure what?
We don't know what it is.
Stone and Leavitt haven't been able to isolate the hellish thing.
Of course they will in time.
Of course.
Hold it.
At the edge of that shadow,
I think...
Me too.
It's an indentation.
Yes, about the size of a pencil point.
Go to 40.
Go to 60.
Jeremy, do you think maybe...
Maybe it's just a grain of sand.
Go to 80.
What about the bits of green?
- Paint.
- For God's sake!
Pistachio ice cream! There's no basis to assume it's anything yet.
You're too good a scientist not to be thinking the same thing I am.
If this is really something new, some brand-new form of life...
The best hope of cracking it is to be grindingly thorough with the help of computer number one.
OK? Now let's get on with it.
Hold it.
More pistachio?
I count four patches.
Keep going. I'll computerize the coordinates.
Let's take a look at the rock at 100.
I doubt that's what knocked the capsule off trajectory.
Unless the rock was going at tremendous speed, or unless it's terribly heavy.
For Pete's sake, Ruth, it can't be that heavy.
Hall and I could lift the capsule.
However, it's possible the rock is different in space.
Out there it might do anything.
Maybe it has elastic properties we don't even know yet.
Let's have a look at the green patches.
They must've come off the rock.
If it is rock.
You know something?
They do look like spatters of paint.
Let's go back to the rock and see it at 440.
If that's a meteor, it's a damn peculiar one.
This left border over here, it's smooth, almost like an artificial surface.
Painted, maybe.
Luminous paint.
If I keep watching it,
I might think so.
Wet paint sign and all.
Jeremy?
What?
Nothing.
You OK?
It's just my eyes are getting tired.
We've been at it five hours straight.
We'll take a caffeine break in a minute.
First, though, I'd like to see one of the separate patches of green at 1,000.
- Did you see that?
- I saw it.
- You didn't change the lighting?
- I didn't touch it.
- It's alive.
- Yes.
It's bigger than two microns.
Which means the infection is spread by a mere fraction of the green.
I'm bringing down cameras.
Let's have the other microscanner.
Stone to level control.
I need a mic-t.
'Roger. Will send.'
Jump it up to 1,500.
Microscan doesn't go any higher.
We can get 1500 light magnification in microchemistry. I'll send the rock through.
'Attention C.L.T.s on levels 4 and 5.
'Main computer shows capacity versus access time,
'at ten to the twelfth bit.
'For any change in memory configuration,
'C.L.T.s must check their unicom op.'
Beautiful, sir.
I'm the mic-t.
You're real sharp on the hands.
Thanks. Nice to know one hasn't lost one's touch.
The next step is to find out what makes it grow.
We'll need samples from the scoop to send through maxcult for culture and isolation.
Roger, sir. In work.
Good God!
It's growing.
Not so good.
Naturally he has acidosis.
His blood pH was nine points off normal.
But why? Stupid machine!
What makes his blood too acid?
Ask the patient.
'Bio-safety to S.L., sectors 3 and 6.
'Give us a code 3 when you get it.'
Mr. Jackson?
Now, don't be scared.
I'm a doctor.
Bull.
Where am I?
A special laboratory in Nevada.
We brought you here from Piedmont.
You're sick.
It's this damn stomach of mine.
Bleeding?
Hell, yes, bleeding!
Bleeding in your stomach?
You have an ulcer?
Damn tootin'. Two years.
But you must have pain.
What do you do for it?
Aspirin...
And squeeze.
"Squeeze"?
What's that?
Ain't gonna tell ya.
So you're a Sterno drinker, huh?
Works good.
Give him squeeze.
What's the baby's name,
Mr. Jackson?
You the nurse?
Uh-huh.
Shoot!
Can't see your legs.
Do you know the baby's name?
Give us a butt first.
Smoking isn't allowed here.
Then go fish.
Yeah.
When you're finished, we'll transfuse
Jackson and start ice water lavage.
He has a two-year history of bleeding ulcers.
You seem delighted.
It may be the reason he survived.
If only our young gourmet weren't so normal.
Well, let's hope nothing changes that.
We might have to before this is over.
They should've dropped the bomb.
They should've dropped it two days ago, General.
This Phantom crashed a good 60 miles beyond the cordoned area.
Men on the ground can't cordon off airspace, sir.
I just don't understand why the Wildfire team hasn't beefed about the delay in 7-12.
It's been almost 24 hours, and not a word from them.
I don't think Piedmont had anything to do with this crash, Manchek.
It was a fluke.
That plane was only over the w.f. area for two minutes at 23,000 feet.
It's a routine training mission accident, I bet you.
Pilot error. Let's go.
Check with Wildfire message center, delta five.
Make sure everything there is nominal.
Send me word on scrambler at big head crash base.
OK.
Checklim program completed.
All circuit banks nominal.
Same thing on the M.C.N. console,
Captain.
Just a minute,
Dr. Robertson.
You're saying Stone's $90 million facility, which you recommended, was knocked out by a sliver of paper?
You tell that to the taxpayers!
These were highly-trained electronics men, Senator, looking for an electronic fault.
The trouble was purely mechanical of the simplest kind.
But for them, it was like trying to see an elephant through a microscope.
The sliver had peeled from the roll and wedged between the bell and striker, preventing the bell from ringing.
I'm convinced we're being held incommunicado.
Very flattering. We don't know much more than when we got here.
We know about Scoop now.
It's possible what Scoop found was no accident.
I suspect they were looking for the ultimate biological weapon.
Sounds like you're getting a little paranoid in this fun house.
What does Stone think?
About the ultimate weapon, I mean.
We've isolated the organism.
It's in microchemistry.
We'll show you.
'Watchdog to electrical support.
Sectors three to...'
Alright, Lieutenant.
'Albuquerque center,
Albuquerque center.
- 'This is Air Force 561.'
- 'Go ahead 561.'
'My air hose is coming apart, like it's dissolving!'
'561. Have you...'
'Everything made of rubber is coming apart!
'I feel funny.'
It's a fluke, a vibration effect maybe.
Let's get up there.
Has Wildfire been informed?
- You mean the germ people?
- Yeah.
It went out to them on the scrambler an hour ago.
Well, this they can't ignore.
'I.B. control to cafeteria level three.
'Number 4 charlie hatch shows condition blue.
'Alter responsivity characteristics until you get condition green.'
Ready.
Nothing so unusual about our rock after all.
Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, silicon, etcetera.
Except the black rock isn't rock at all.
It's some kind of material similar to plastic.
How about that?
The green is even simpler.
Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
The four basic elements of life on Earth, nothing else.
That's a relief.
I'd have been happier if it'd turned out not to be alive.
Green stuff, you really had us going for a while.
A.A. analysis results are ready,
Dr. Dutton.
Something's wrong.
It's not registering.
Yes it is, sir.
It's just registering double-zero, double-zero.
We'll switch to computerized analysis.
No amino acids!
No proteins, no enzymes, no nucleic acid.
Impossible!
No organism can maintain life without them!
You mean no Earth organism?
It must have evolved in a totally different way.
You got it.
It doesn't come from here.
Without chemical reactions there can't be life,
- yet it grows, reproduces...
- Wait!
The infection at Piedmont has been stopped by the bomb.
We're secure at Wildfire.
We have everything we need to achieve a breakthrough.
All we have to do is attack this problem like any other in science.
You could spend years working on a thing like that, without solving its structure.
But when you do, there'll be some red faces around.
It could change everything.
Great.
Ruth, since Kirke isn't here, you take over the growth program in microbiology.
We're halfway home if we find out what will keep that from growing.
- Charlie, you work with me on the E.M.
- Alright.
- All I'm...
- Let me get back to my patients.
I'm sure they were protected by the same thing, some simple mechanism,
I just don't recognize yet.
There's gotta be something that the old man and the baby have in common.
Oh, Hall?
Five minutes.
You told me before.
Yes, we wouldn't want you to get too far from the substation now.
'Now, men, keep a sharp eye open for pieces of rubber.
'I'll repeat that for you.
'Keep a sharp eye open for pieces of rubber.'
Major! Major Manchek!
Take a look at that, sir.
We just found this, General.
It's a human bone.
Arm, I think.
It looks picked clean, almost like it was polished.
That's right.
Well, I don't get it.
There is no actual rubber on the Phantom F-4, General.
It's all a synthetic plastic compound called Polycron.
It has some of the characteristics of human skin.
What the hell is that?
What's left of his oxygen mask.
It's made of Polycron.
I'd say it was done by a chemical reaction of some sort.
- Or maybe a microorganism.
- Meaning?
Meaning there was something in that plane that consumes plastic.
How's Maxcult coming, Ruth?
Will you be finished by the midnight conference?
Easy.
Good. You can give us the results then.
Feeling better, aren't you,
Mr. Jackson?
Yep.
Do you always have to wear that iron suit?
Yep.
Maybe you'll tell us the baby's name now,
Mr. Jackson.
Manuel Rios. Mex.
Real little heller.
Squalls morning, noon and night.
Neighbors wouldn't let 'em keep their windows open.
Do you sleep with your window closed?
No siree, Bob.
Fresh air fiend.
Tell us what happened, Mr. Jackson.
I don't want to think about it.
You know what people will say?
Piedmont was bad.
That's why it was punished.
First the town went crazy and then was destroyed.
You're crazy.
Folks at Piedmont was good.
Decent, normal folks.
The man we found dressed up in his Doughboy's uniform, call that normal?
Pete Arnold who worked at the store.
- It was the disease.
- How do you know?
Cos the only thing wrong with him before that night was sugar.
Diabetes?
Did he take insulin?
A couple of times a day.
Hated the needle.
I tried to talk him into using squeeze.
Insulin. If he missed his treatment, he'd go...
Thanks, Mr. Jackson.
Oh, my God.
'Central C.C. to big P.C. control, all levels.
'Testing laser systems.
'Please maintain random fringe drift within ten percent of initial value.'
'Dr. Leavitt, you have a midnight conference.
'The signal has struck twice.'
I heard!
I heard. I've... I've been busy.
The important thing is that something can slow it down.
I think it's some kind of blood disorder.
If the old soldier missed his insulin treatment, he'd go into acidosis.
The same as Jackson on Sterno.
I'll bet Leavitt finds the organism shows no growth on some of the blood cultures.
What's wrong with the baby's blood?
Nothing. So far.
Then you're back where you started.
No, somehow they're all interrelated.
I'll have the answer when I know why a 69-year-old Sterno drinker with an ulcer is like a normal, six-month old baby.
- Did you get any no-growth readouts...
- No, but I'm not finished yet.
You told me you'd be finished by the conference time.
I decided to play part of it back.
What for? The first time around should be enough...
Knock it off, Hall.
Wait. Wait.
We're all tired.
Tired people make mistakes.
They draw wrong conclusions, they drop things.
That mustn't happen.
Starting now, I want the team to get six hours sleep out of every 24.
Suits me.
Before turning in, shouldn't we file for a code name?
Yeah, good idea.
'Nine over four over eight under 167.29.
'Auto check in grade.
'Auto check in grade.'
Why Andromeda?
- Andromeda's our...
- Stone.
"Directive 7-12 has not been acted upon.
Alternative directive 7-11 now in effect."
- They didn't drop the bomb!
- It's an M.C.N. transmission sent yesterday.
Idiots!
- Put me through to Dr. Robertson.
- In work, sir.
Burke, you didn't special alert an M.C.N. message to us.
There haven't been any, sir.
The bell didn't ring.
Don't argue, dammit!
I've got one in my hand.
Well, well, about time we heard from you.
There has been a communications foul-up.
Never mind that now.
Why hasn't that bomb been dropped on Piedmont?
The decision on 7-12 isn't final.
It was just postponed 48 hours.
By then the disease could spread into a worldwide epidemic.
It's because of rash statements like that, the President doesn't trust scientists.
Warn the President it may already be too late.
Stay on his back, Robbie.
You've got to make him call a 7-12.
Can you get me another appointment tonight, Grimes?
Now let's all just keep our heads screwed on.
Any thoughts about the Phantom crash?
We sent you a couple messages on it.
A Phantom jet strayed over the cordoned area around Piedmont.
Any other information?
Well, the pilot said that all the rubber on the plane was dissolving.
- His last communication was pretty weird.
- Like he was crazy?
He was mighty confused, that's for sure.
Robbie, it's your job to get the President to activate a 7-12 immediately.
If he doesn't, there's no guarantee anyone west of Piedmont will be alive in the morning.
Simmer down, Professor.
I'll wake the boss.
But General Sparks says the crash was just a fluke.
Forget the crash, Robbie.
Stay on that 7-12 and get back to me.
We'll be working around the clock.
That's a good slice.
It's too thick.
I'm setting it at 800 angstroms, Hall.
And I'm going to a higher magnification.
Now we're getting somewhere!
Yeah. But these can't be more than a few molecules in depth.
That's the one.
That silver one.
'This is a Villabach alert, all levels.
'This is a Villabach alert.
'Electromagnetic waves are not registering on the D.I.R.'
Sample in the button and seal, Charlie.
Start the vacuum pump.
Stone, can I see you?
I have the results of the growth cultures.
No, we can't leave now.
We have an Andromeda cell in the E.M.
OK, Charlie, let's put it on the screen.
Let's run it through the computer for contrast expansion.
Stone?
What do you think?
Looks like a crystal.
- Well, gentlemen, there's our answer.
- To what?
How Andromeda functions without amino acids.
- Crystalline structure.
- Yes.
I've often thought that living matter might be based on crystals of some kind.
All these wedge-shaped compartments, they'd serve to separate bio-chemical functions very well.
It's dividing.
In a vacuum, bombarded by electrons?
It shouldn't even be alive.
That's what I wanted to tell you.
The growth program shows
Andromeda can live on anything.
Only gas and light affect it.
You didn't get any no-growth results on the cultures?
None. Look.
The poorest growth occurs in pure oxygen, incubated under infrared light.
Andromeda grows best in carbon dioxide and hydrogen, incubated under X-rays.
No excretions.
No waste of any kind.
You'd expect that.
Andromeda's perfect for existence in outer space.
Consumes everything, wastes nothing.
- Good Lord.
- What?
Stone to delta five.
Put me through to Robertson immediately.
- What?
- God, I hope we're not too late.
- Tell me.
- It functions like an atomic reactor.
An atomic blast could provide it with enough energy
- to grow into a gigantic super colony.
- In one day.
You can relax now.
We've just left the President.
He agreed to drop the bomb.
No, you've got to stop 7-12 from being carried out.
Now, wait a minute.
We're not playing ping-pong.
- We just got through telling the President...
- For God's sake, go back.
It grows when exposed to X-rays or any source of energy.
Tell him, no nuclear device must be detonated anywhere near it.
We just found out Andromeda works like a little reactor: converts matter to energy, energy to matter directly.
Then the bomb would only provide a fantastically rich growth medium.
- Understand?
- No, but I'll pass along the recommendation.
The boss will be pleased to know that he made the right decision on 7-12 in the first place.
Congratulate him on his scientific insight.
Oh, and Robbie?
You'd better get the atomic self-destruct in here disarmed as soon as possible.
Right. I'll start on the clearances now.
It'll be done by morning.
No, no, no. That won't work until the damn thing's going.
All the molecules appear to be the same.
Yes.
Andromeda isn't composed of different substances like a normal cell.
All the subunits are the same.
Damndest thing I've ever s...
Boy, a single substance.
Then how the hell does it operate?
How does anything so simple utilize energy for growth?
No way of telling from that structure.
Yes, there is.
With this new data, we can now get a computerized version of how Andromeda functions.
They're not uniform.
Could be mutations.
- What the devil?
The computer's overloaded.
Too much data coming in too fast.
Dividing and mutating at the same time?
And nothing to stop it.
Normal earth checks and balances don't exist for it.
We'd better get a bio-math mapping of its new growth potential and spread.
According to this, there'll be a super colony of Andromeda
- over the entire southwest...
- Jeremy!
These are biological warfare maps.
Yes, so they are.
Oh, but simulations, Charlie.
Defensive.
It's just a scenario.
That's not the point, for God's sake.
Wildfire was built for germ warfare.
Wildfire and Scoop.
And you knew, Stone.
- You knew it!
- That's not true, Ruth.
I learned about Scoop the same time you did.
They already had
Andromeda programmed.
The purpose of Scoop was to find new biological weapons in outer space,
- and then use Wildfire to develop them.
- It stinks, Stone!
You're blowing your tops.
We have no proof.
- The map!
- Don't be an ass!
That map only shows what Andromeda could do in the hands of an enemy.
Enemy?
We did it to ourselves.
Perhaps, but this is hardly the time to organize a protest.
Another giant leap for mankind.
I wish I could believe you.
Whether you do or not, the only important thing now is to find the antidote.
Let's get on with it, Charlie.
Test the cultured organisms for biologic potency.
Alright, I'll run them against a rat in autopsy.
- I want to seal up the capsule.
- Watch it.
Andromeda's altered.
Its effect might be radically different.
I'll try to get us a photo of the mutated form.
'Photo lab to red map.
'The offbeat access reference reads at 649-F, 1,500...
'Please copy.'
This may be the key to beating Andromeda.
How?
By starving him to death?
No, but don't feed him until I tell you.
Contamination.
'A seal has broken in autopsy.
A seal has broken in autopsy.
'Emergency procedures are in effect.'
- What's the matter?
- Infection spread. Autopsy.
- Is he alive?
- I should've been with him! Dr. Dutton!
It's no use.
It's sealed off.
Dr. Hall!
She's in trouble.
Ruth, are you...
She's got the germ!
Someone bring 100 milligrams of Phenobarb in a syringe fast!
There's no danger.
She isn't contagious.
There's no danger!
'...to L-5, P.I.E. and E.T.E.
'Your second quarter rest period has been canceled.
'Time R.A. has been reassigned according to crash program...'
Come on.
Come on.
She can't hurt you.
Wasn't she with Dr. Dutton?
No, it's epilepsy. Give her the injection.
She'll be alright.
Good girl. Thanks.
I'm scared.
Oh Lord, I'm scared.
You'll be OK, Charlie. We're pumping pure oxygen through your lab now.
We know Andromeda doesn't do well in oxygen.
- He's alive.
- Where have you been?
- Leavitt had a seizure.
- What?
Epilepsy. The red light flashing at three per second brought on a fit.
Why the hell didn't she tell us about it?
Probably no top lab would have her if they knew.
Insurance, prejudice, all that crap.
From the middle ages.
Amazing he's still alive.
It's been three minutes.
He's on pure oxygen.
I don't know how long that can hold him.
We're, um... working on some ideas, Charlie.
Ask your germ warfare friends.
They have lots.
Try to stay calm.
- What happened?
- The seal must've broken in there.
They had the same thing at the lunar lab.
That's why we use
Polycron gaskets here.
At least the rest of Wildfire is secure.
Poor devil.
Look at the way he's breathing.
He's scared to death.
That oxygen should relax him, slow down his breathing.
No, we want him to breathe fast.
In Piedmont,
Jackson was crocked on Sterno.
Sterno acidosis.
Acidosis, rapid breathing.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Turn off the oxygen. Put him on room air.
- The baby, he's normal.
- Cries all the time. Can't catch his breath.
- Rapid breathing? It just can't be that simple.
- It isn't.
Dutton,
I think rapid breathing helps.
Don't let the bug in your lungs long enough to penetrate blood vessels.
I want to turn off the pure oxygen, then you start breathing room air as fast as you can.
No! No, I was running a test in here.
The air is thick with Andromeda.
Experiment with your own life, dammit!
- We won't do it, Charlie. Take it easy.
- I know I'm close.
I'm sure it has something to do with blood chemistry and breathing.
Dr. Hall!
May I please feed the baby now, Dr. Hall?
He's been crying steadily...
That's what I want.
Keep him crying.
And run another blood value on him.
Get his pH measurements.
Yes, Doctor!
With all the yelling, blowing off carbon dioxide, the kid should have too little acid.
Alkalotic, a blood condition just the opposite from the old man.
Too much alkali.
What good does that do Dutton?
Karen, where's the blood test?
It's coming through now on your console.
Hell of a way to run a hospital.
Just what you expected.
Opposite blood chemistries, the baby and the old man.
- One of them should be a dead opposite.
- But he's not.
There must be a connection!
They both stayed alive at Piedmont breathing the same air.
One's blood too alkaline, the other too... acid.
Yes.
Yes!
Dutton, I'm turning off the oxygen.
Breathe fast and hard.
No, Jeremy!
Don't let him cut off my oxygen.
No!
- The air in that room is loaded...
- Air doesn't matter.
Blood does.
That's the answer.
I need 30 seconds to run a growth program.
He could die in 30 seconds.
Besides, Leavitt checked all the growth programs.
She might have missed something.
Epileptics blank out.
I want to see how the growth of Andromeda is affected by blood chemistry.
The pH... Oh, damn.
You do it.
Excellent. The graph's practically straight up and down.
That means that Andromeda can only exist within a narrow range of pH.
A very narrow range.
On either side of the tolerance range, no growth. Nothing, right?
It's exterminated.
- Dutton, our troubles are over.
- Look at your console.
It grows within a narrow range of pH.
A very narrow range.
If your blood's abnormal, if it's too acid or alkaline,
Andromeda can't survive in the body.
So breathe as fast as you can.
Go into respiratory alkalosis.
Yes, fine. That'll shoot your blood chemistry to hell.
It's what happens to the baby when he cries too much, or the old man on Sterno.
- How do you feel?
- OK.
Uh... a little dizzy, but OK.
He can't keep breathing like that forever.
He'll hyperventilate, pass out.
We've got to get him something to alkalize his blood.
We can't in there.
Charlie!
That cage.
In the hot room.
Right in front of you.
It's alive!
The rat's been exposed as long as I have.
Longer. I exposed it to the cultures before the seal broke.
Precisely.
Andromeda's mutated to a noninfectious form.
Holy...
Where does that gasket lead?
Central core.
It connects all the labs.
The gaskets are decomposing.
It's Andromeda.
Next sector.
There's no substation in this sector.
'Level 5 is sealed.
Level 5 is sealed.
'Emergency procedures are in effect.'
When the bomb goes off, there'll be a thousand mutations.
Andromeda will spread everywhere.
They'll never be rid of it.
'There are now five minutes to self-destruct.'
What about the other levels?
Can't tell. Each sector seals off when it's contaminated, even the elevator.
The defense system is perfect, Mark.
It'll even bury our mistakes.
What about the central core?
- The core's equipped with safeguards.
- Like what?
Gas, lasers...
To prevent escape of lab animals.
What would my chances be in there?
They don't exist for anyone, anywhere if you stay here.
- How do I get into the core?
- Through that service port.
Go ahead. I'll ride shotgun for you in main control.
I can't monitor the lasers here.
Karen, get me a scalpel.
'There are now
4 minutes and 30 seconds to self-destruct.'
Cut it off!
Cut the panel off.
Karen, cut it!
Come on, hurry up.
Hey, Doc, you ain't leaving us here, are you?
The lasers are tuned low for small animals, Mark.
You can make it if you're not hit along the spinal cord.
'There are now
4 minutes to self-destruct.'
That's the ladder across from you.
Go, man, before the gas starts.
'There are now 3 minutes and 30 seconds to self-destruct.'
That's the gas.
Keep going.
The sensors have picked you up.
Get moving.
Duck!
Keep going.
Duck!
Keep going.
Duck!
'There are now
3 minutes to self-destruct.'
No, it's no good.
The level's contaminated.
You'll have to go to 3.
Go to 3!
'There are now
2 minutes and 45 seconds to self-destruct.'
Sway! Weave!
You're zeroed in. Duck!
'There are now
2 minutes and 30 seconds to self-destruct.'
Keep going!
You'll make it.
'There are now
2 minutes and 15 seconds to self-destruct.'
Fight the effect.
It's mostly shock.
You've lost some time, but you can still do it. See the door?
'There are now
2 minutes to self-destruct.
'There is now 1 minute and 45 seconds to self-destruct.
'There is now 1 minute and 30 seconds to self-destruct.
'There is now...'
- You're in an airlock. Turn the wheel.
- '...1 minute and 15 seconds...'
No, no, not that one!
The one near the door!
'There are now
60 seconds to self-destruct.
'There are now
55 seconds to self-destruct.
'There are now
50 seconds to self-destruct.'
Where is it?
- 'There are now 45 seconds...'
- Come on, where is it?
Help me!
'There are now
40 seconds to self-destruct.
'There are now
35 seconds to self-destruct.
'There are now
30 seconds to self-destruct.
'There are now
25 seconds to self-destruct.
'20 seconds, 19, 18, 17,
'Self-destruct has been canceled.'
Congratulations.
I take it the bomb didn't...
No, it didn't.
Eight seconds to spare.
Hardly even exciting.
What's happening?
The supercolony's now off the coast, moving southwest across the Pacific.
Apparently Andromeda hasn't turned lethal again.
At least there hasn't been any reports of bizarre death.
We're applying an adaptation of your antidote to it, Mark.
Cloud seeding.
We're seeding the clouds above Andromeda with silver iodide.
The raindrops will carry the organism into the ocean, and the alkaline reaction from seawater should kill it.
Just as acids or alkali in the blood stopped it.
This cloud seeding business, Stone, you absolutely sure it worked?
You better be.
All reports continue to indicate the experiment was successful, Senator.
Then we can feel confident your so-called biological crisis is over.
As far as
Andromeda's concerned, yes.
We have the organism at Wildfire and we continue to study it.
We now know beyond a doubt that other forms of life exist in the universe.
Thanks to Scoop.
Yes.
However, with this new knowledge, there's no guarantee that another so-called biological crisis won't occur again.
Hmm.
What do we do about that?
Precisely, Senator.
What do we do?
You did it! You did it!
Come here!
You just hit it big time!
You just won the Big Bundle!
And what a bundle it is, Ron!
Do you realize you just won $50,000?
There you are.
Yeah, that's only the beginning.
The Really Big Bundle is that you're going to have a week at the most fabulous resort in the world.
You're going to Delos, Ron!
- Delos!
- That's right, Delos.
Where you may choose Roman World, a lusty treat for the senses, where beautiful robot women are yours to command and robot gladiators die at the point of your sword.
Or Medieval World, an exact reconstruction of 13th century Europe, where you may live like an absolute king.
Or Spa World, a garden of pleasure, where old age and pain have been eliminated.
Or Futureworld, where you will be transported throughout the solar system, commanding you very own rocket ship, enjoying the favors of robot women of weightless beauty, soaring through space like an astronaut.
All that and more is yours, Ron.
Congratulations.
You keep following me?
Bye, Mac.
Hello, Shorty.
How many points you gonna give on the Colts?
- Seven.
- Seven?
I got 50 says you're wrong.
Ain't never gonna get rich being stupid.
Just say I got a hunch.
- I read your column today.
- Yeah, what'd you think?
It's gonna wrap a lot of garbage.
Yeah, quack, quack, quack.
Hey, you behind on your bills?
Good morning to you too.
Some guy's been calling for you every five minutes for the last two hours.
Driving me nuts!
- Get a number?
- Nope.
City desk, Browning.
Is this Chuck Browning?
That's right.
Look, you wrote a story a couple of years ago about the trouble at Westworld.
You're the same guy, right?
You bet.
I got a story for you, maybe a big one.
All right, tell me.
You crazy? I ain't giving it away.
I'm in trouble. I need some money.
- Okay, how much?
- I don't know.
All I want is for you to meet me somewhere.
I'll tell you what I got, you pay me what it's worth.
All right, what's your name?
Frenchy. Frenchy DuPorte.
Mee tme in ten mimutes at the
Hyatt Regency crossover, Frenchy.
What do you look like?
I seen your picture.
I'll find you.
Anything?
It's my day for long shots.
Frenchy?
What's the matter?
Frenchy, what happened?
Delos.
What?
Delos.
- You're late.
- You're right.
Two years ago, the worst day in the history of Delos began with no obvious signs that anything would go wrong.
The robots were behaving as programmed.
And although there was some evidence of circuit malfunction, it was well within the normal parameters.
Mr. Dyffy, are you saying that despite your sophisticated sensors,
- What the hell are you doing here?
- you had absolutely no indication about it?
- Later.
- None at all.
Then quite suddenly, one of our most complicated robot gunslingers began to act in a most vicious manner.
For the first time in our history, a robot actually killed a guest.
Within a few moments
Delos was in turmoil.
I thought your only problem was in Westworld?
No, thanks to your Mr. Browning,
Westworld got the brunt of the bad publicity, but the breakdown occured throughout the resort.
Mr. Duffy, I don't quite understand why you didn't shut off the power supply to your robots.
We did.
But they ran on reserve long enough to do a great deal of damage.
- How many guests were killed?
- More than 50.
And of course, many of our own technicians also died.
In fact, by the time we regained control,
95 members of our technical and maintenance staff had either been killed or wounded.
Aside from the human loss,
It was a financial and public relations disaster of the first magnitude.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, those of us who have devoted our lives to creating Delos, were stunned by the events I've just shown you.
Yet, we did not lose faith.
Now, for the last two years, we have invested more than 1.5 billion dollars to rebuild our equipement.
We have replaced every circuit, every program, every robot.
The new Delos is not only the most fantastic resort in human history, it is also fail-safe.
Now, last month, as you know, we re-opened the resort.
Public response has been good, but, quite frankly, not as good as it should be.
Our problem is the memory of a disaster at Westworld.
And that's why we've come to you.
We offer the IMC Network an absolute exclusive story for all media.
Every phase of our operation will be open to you.
And all we ask in return is that you treat us in a fair and positive manner.
Arthur.
Arthur, you mustn't do this to me.
Not for one damn minute, do you hear me?
They can hear you in the lobby, honey.
I'm not talking to you, mister!
Listen, you promised me that the Delos story would be mine.
Exclusive to television and exclusive to me, is that right?
- Yes.
- Then will you tell me why this ink-stained Neanderthal was invited to our meeting?
He has an angle. I want to pursue it.
Well, let's call it a hunch.
Oh, wonderful.
And when the people at Delos find out that you have sent Mr. Bad News himself, that's the end of our exclusive.
I told Mr. Duffy what I had in mind.
He has no objection.
- Well, I do!
- Yes, I gathered as much.
But I would like to remind you that while you are indeed a glamorous and highly paid television correspondent, you're still an employee.
In fact, you're my employee.
And unless you would like to spend the next five years doing weather and fashion in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, you will now shut up and do as you're told.
Oh, yes?
Yes, Arthur?
We'll see about that.
Excuse me.
Socks, come on, lighten up.
Oh, what do you want?
Well, I just want to tell you I like your style.
You had old Holcombe there swallowing his corporate stripes.
You mean you're sorry you fired me?
That was 'cause you weren't a very good reporter.
Listen, I was a kid out of college who happened to think that newspapers ought to be more than dirt and bad news.
That sounds like a line from an old movie.
You know, you'd think that even so dumb a brain as yours would finally get the message.
I happen to have 55 million viewers worldwide.
You've got a couple thousand old crones in the public library.
Why don't you wise up, mister?
Nobody reads.
Well, then you've got nothing to worry about.
Now, come on, let's have a truce.
I don't trust you.
Well, you like me a little, don't you?
Anyway, we've got a week to spend together alone, so what the hell?
I don't like being called Socks.
Well, I can't help that.
The first time that I was with you, you had those outrageous red socks on.
Took me a week to get over that.
Yeah, and then you fired me.
Well, now listen, that was business.
Now, come on, what do you say?
Truce, huh?
I'll think about it.
General Karnovski regrets, but he does not give interviews now.
He's on vacation.
Well, listen the right interview in an important American paper could be good for the General.
Maybe get him a promotion.
The General does not need a promotion.
You've got a point.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You mean to tell me that you've never heared of me?
I mean, really.
I mean, come on, you look at me.
You're putting me on with those beautiful green eyes.
Honey, I won, the Big Bundle!
The TV contest!
You must've heard of that!
A montage of international types.
I think that would be a good idea.
Well, well, how do you do?
- Terrible.
- Why?
I tried the Iranian oil ministers, nothing.
Karnovski said nyet.
That leaves Takaguchi.
My last shot over there.
What is it that you're after, anyway?
I don't know, this Delos guset list looks like a rerun from the last
Geneva Conference.
Oil ministers, rocket experts, heavyweight electronic types.
For God sakes, at $1,200 a day, who else could afford this?
You know, you are looking for something that isn't there.
You may be right.
Hey, Miss Ballard.
Miss Ballard, now, listen now, you have got to put me on your show.
No fooling now, I am a real angle.
Oh, excuse me, pal.
Oh, that's all right. Listen, why don't you take that seat there?
- Oh, thanks, thanks.
- You bet.
- What's your name?
- Ron Thurlow, Ron.
The Big Bundle, you know?
- Ron, I'm Chuck Browning.
- Hi.
Ron, you don't read, do you?
Me, no, I'm a tube freak.
Right, well, you just sit right there,
'cause I know Miss Ballard loves to get close to her viewers.
- Oh, thanks.
- You bet.
- Yeah.
- Ciao.
- Thanks, pal.
- Anytime.
Nice felllow. Now, listen, here's the deal, Miss Ballard.
You see, now, I am a common type man, but you see, right now, well, I'm a big winner.
Now, that's news, right?
Yes, that's right, Ron, but let me tell you something.
You see, the video crew isn't here on this trip.
This is just a research trip, you see.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Doggone that's too bad.
- Sorry.
Hey, do you know what this fella told me?
He told me, "Once you make it with a robot chick,
"that's it, you don't never want nothing else."
I swear to God, that's what he told me.
Are you going to do it?
Do what, Ron?
Have sex with a robot?
Not this trip, Ron.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Salahari International Airport.
Delos passangers may proceed directly to the resort.
All others, please go to
Customs and Immigration.
Thank you.
We have four special subjects now arriving.
Open the SR in progrid for file record.
Subject Karnovski, file record number SR0072.

Subject Ballard, file record number SR0074.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Delos,
the most unique resort in the history of the world.
All guests will please proceed to the proper color level
of the world you've chosen to visit.
You will then be escorted to our costume rooms
for selection and fitting.
Thank you.
- Futureworld?
- Yeah, that's me.
Please, come this way.
Sure will, ooh man, you are some kind of machnery.
All the girls on Futureworld as pretty as you are?
Oh, yes, sir, they come in all shapes and sizes.
Whatever you desire.
Honey, you are perfect.
Oh, no sir, I'm a 500.
I'm not programmed for sex.
- Futureworld, huh?
- Mmm.
Well, Duffy wasn't lying about one thing.
What's that?
This place is three time larger than the old one.
- Is it?
- You bet, and how.
Well, it's all set, a day or two in Futureworld, and you can come back stage with me and see the hard work behind the magic.
Of course, at any time, you're free to go where you wish.
No restrictions?
Well, for your own safety, we can't have you wandering off just anywhere.
But whatever you want to see, we'll be glad to show you.
Well, that's a hell of a lot better than the last time I was here.
Well, we have blast off scheduled in half an hour.
And you, Miss Ballard, are the commander of the flight.
I am?
Medieval World guests are reminded
that no cameras may be taken beyond this area.
Please, leave all cameras and photographic equipment
at the costume desk.
- Mr. Takaguchi?
- Yes.
I'm very sorry, I've checked with control, and it's impossible for you to use your father's sword.
- We're very sorry.
- Quite right, I understand.
Your weapons must, of course, be very special.
I'm really very nervous.
Oh, no, there's nothing to worry about.
It's all play-like, we're not really going anywhere.
I don't think.
Ta-da.
- So, how do I look, huh?
- Not too shabby, come on.
Oh, not so bad yourself.
My name is Eric. This is Erica.
We will be ypur guides in Futureword.
Now, if you will all follow us, we will take a tram to the launch area.
Please, stay in the group.
Those selecting Futureworld
are in route to the Aries II space shuttle,
which will take you to a rendez-vous to the Voyager starship now in orbit.
Aboard the starship, you will be able to walk in space
and on the surface of the moon.
You will also see the Martian ice caps, ride an asteroid,
and experience all the thrills of deep space.
All Futureworld guests are reminded
that Futureworld is a perfectly safe environment
designed for your pleasure.
Any appearance of danger is simply a device to enhance your experience.
In Futureworld, nothing can go wrong.
...relaxed morality in beautiful Pompeii.
Please, indulge your every whim.
Whatever you wish, will be yours.
Follow me, please.
Wow, I could open the program with this.
Yep.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to board.
Please, follow me.
Step right up here.
Thank you.
Watch your steps, please.
- Right in here.
- In there?
Watch your steps, please.
Yes? Am I doing all right?
You are doing fine.
Just follow the program as Chuck reads it off to you.

- Hello!
Hello, anybody. Anybody?
Oh, Jesus.
All hatches have been secured.
This is Houston Control.
All systems are in a go status.
We are at T-minus 30 and counting.
This is so real.
I've changed my mind.
I want to go to Medieval World.
Now, Mrs Reed, nothing can go wrong.
- This is Houston Control.
- It's only a simulation.
- We are in final launch sequence
- I know.
- at T-minus 15 and counting.
- I know.
Program the blast-off sequence.
We have ignition.
Increase passenger vibration red-line six.
We are at maximum RFs and Gs.
Bring the load simulator on the line at 1425.
Prepare weightless simulation to begin on my mark.
We have been notified by Robot Center that Mr. Mubutu...
We will begin the Waters of Youth sequence on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
Prepare the illusion of Youth sequence for General and Mrs. Karnovski.
When their hypnotic state has been achieved,

At the General's request,
the Czar will give a ball in their honor
at 2130 hours.
Notify Robot Center that repairs on Czarina model 614 must be completed by 1900 hours.
Prepare the Saxon Knight sequence to begin on my mark.
Who authorized the camera?
No one, sir, they were told not to bring them.
Well, don't make any issue of it, but program the queen to steal it from him.
Yes, sir.
Begin the Saxon Knight sequence on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
I smell a heathen pig!
No doubt, sir, you smell yourself!
Notify Robot Center that the Saxon Knight has been terminated by Mr. Takaguchi.
Everything all right?
Yes, I think so.
You spend too much time here.
Well, these people are important.
I don't want anything to go wrong.
Nothing can go wrong.

- Mr. Thurlow.
- Yeah, yes.
- We're ready to go now.
- Oh, right. I'll be right with you.
Now, listen, I'll see you all later, okay?
Hey, I'm going to go skiing now.
What do you think of that?
- Bye, Ron.
- Oh, wow.
- See you later.
- You bet.
All right, all right.
My knight to your pawn.
My castle to your knight.
Man, lookie here. Hiya, hi there.
Hey, ain't this something, man?
Now, are there any other questions?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you sure we can't get hurt?
'Cause I got plans for tonight.
There's really nothing to worry about.
Skiing on Mars is not that different than on Earth.
Of course, the snow is red.
And gravity is one third.
But your skis are designed for that purpose.
Ladies and gentlemen,
all guests are encouraged to request the host
or hostess of their choice.
Why can't you?
Because I'm too old for you.
I'd feel like a fool.
Not at all.
You must remember that I've been programmed for your pleasure.
In my eyes, you are very beautiful.
Hey, we've got to try this thing.
Put your quarter on the table, honey.
We'll get to that one.
I'll be there in a second.
Yes, sir. May I get you something?
You have pretty good memory banks?
I'm a 500, sir.
- We have quite excellent memories.
- Good.
You ever seen that fellow before?
No, sir. Is he a guest?
I guess you'd call him inoperative.
Thanks.
Now, are you sure that they are robots?
- They're not ging to get hurt or anything, are they?
- Positive.
Just pick up the gloves, honey.
Okay.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- Chuck?
- Yeah?
I forgive you everything.
Did you see that?
Did you see that left? Pow!
Terrific.
I'm afraid I interrupted.
Bu I think now would be a good time for you to come backstage with me.
All the worlds are at full function, and you do have limited time.
- Good.
- I forgot something.
I'll be right back. Excuse me.
Bartender?
Yes, sir?
That photo I showed you earlier,
I forgot to get it back.
Oh, no, sir. I gave you the picture back.
No, you didn't.
Oh, yes, sir.
- You're a liar.
- No, sir.
I'm not programmed to lie.
Well, for a man without a program, you do a pretty damn good job!
Something wrong?
No.
No, I must've made a mistake.
Well, to err is human.
That must be it.
But it's all right. I have another one.
Your attention, please.
The first space safari to the caves of Venus
is available for sign up at the tour desk.
Mr. Duffy, you know, I wanted to ask you about those chessmen.
Are they real, or what are they?
No, they're holograms.
Optical illusions.
Everything in Futureworld is perfectly safe.
We don't use this very often, so... watch your step, huh?
It's hard to belive we never left the ground.
I was convinced that we were really in orbit.
I thought the queen stole that camera.
She did. Apparently, he stole it back.
The Takaguchi horse and lance are now programmed for combat with a plus 10 probability of victory on the first pass.
Begin the joust sequence on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
Guests always win?
We try to make it believable for them, of course.
But the guests are always the victors.
Mind if we look around?
No, go right ahead.
Please, mark this robot for pick-up and repair.
Notify Robor Center that all vital signs were terminated...
You just relax and enjoy yourself.
Take this all in.
Come here a second.
- Where are we going?
- Just come here.
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?
I want you to pick out one of these guys and turn him on.
Why would you want me to do that?
- Just trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
Just trust me for once, will you Socks?
Pick out one of these guys and do a number on him and get him interested, you know?
What is your game?
It's no game, believe me.
Oh, you do remember how to get someone interested?
Do I remember how to get someone interested?
Okay, which one?
Piece of cake.
Hey, you really know what you're doing.
I've been watching you.
I'm Tracy Ballard.
How do you do?
Hi, what's your name?
Steven.
Steven, I'm doing a video special on Delos, and, God, it's so confusing, you know?
I thought maybe later on we could get together.
You could sort of help me out.
I'm sorry, that's not possible.
Ah, you're married, huh?
No, ma'am.
Well.
Gee, this is a wonderful job, but don't you kind of get... a little lonely, Steven?
No, ma'am.
You're not making this easy, Steven.
Tell me, do you think I'm pretty?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I'm awfully lonely here.
Steven, I... I'd like it--
I'm sorry, ma'am.
All right, begin the spacewalk sequence on my mark.
Bring the moon up a little fuller, please.
3, 2, 1, mark.
I think you better try him yourself.
I don't think he likes girls.
Yeah, then come on.
What are we trying to prove?
Just come on.
Give me a quantum 9.
- Hey, Duffy.
- You seen enough?
Enough to know that
I'm getting the fast shuffle.
What are you talking about?
Well, in my business we call it managed news.
Such as?
Such as what's wrong with all the people in this room?
I mean, are they drugged or hypnotized or what?
Because they sure as hell aren't normal.
They're normal for robots.
All these people are machines?
That's impossible!
Seems I'm to blame for not explaining.
You see, we discovered that one of the causes for our disaster with Westworld lay with the human flaws of our controllers.
So we replaced them with these.
The model 700 technician series.
They have no ego.
So, they have no hang-ups.
And thus, one more source of error is eliminated.
They're all robots.
I feel very badly.
I was sure that Dr. Schneider had told you.
Prepare the Martian ski sequence for five guests.
And return power to grid 3.
I'll tell you something, mister.
That is the last time you get me to flyspeck Delos.
And if you don't stop acting like such a paranoid idiot,
I hope Duffy throws you out of here.
Well, why didn't he tell us?
I mean, why did he wait?
He forgot.
Isn't that a perfectly normal human thing to do?
If you weren't so eager to do a hatchet job, you wouldn't think twice about it.
I thought you should see what's left of Westworld.
I don't want to be accused of trying to hide anything.
Oh, now Mr. Duffy, I hope you understand
I don't think you're trying to hide anything.
I think that Delos is wonderful and I'm sure that's how the story's going to come out.
That's very gratifying.
Gratifying, yes. Well, I'd like to have a look around by myself.
If you don't have any objections?
- Not at all.
- Hmm.
Interesting fellow.
- Certainly has a suspicious mind.
- Oh, yes.
He thinks it's admirable.
Chuck?
Chuck, where are you?
Chuck?
Chuck?
Can I give you a hand?
You brat!
I should've known better than to worry about you.
Tracy.
Damn!
I just... can't decide.
Then don't.
Take us both.
I don't think that would work out.
Why not?
We're both sex models.
Yeah, that's okay for you, but... I mean...
I mean, what the hell, I'm no Superman.
You'd be surprised.
Well, I'll leave you to yourselves.
Dinner should be along shortly.
Better get plenty of rest.
Got a big day head of us.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Socks.
Aw, come on, Socks, it was only a joke.
My bed is upstairs, yours is downstairs.
Let's make damn sure we keep it that way.
Monitoring diarthrosis objevis.
Hyaline and synovial read-outs recorded.
Status.
We're completing the gross body series.
We'll start molecular studies in one hour.
All right, did you alter their food?
Yes, sir, we should have 4 to 6 hours.
I want all thermal x-ray and electrochemical studies finished by tonight.
- That's not much time.
- It'll have to do.
Our Mr. Browning is getting much too curious.
I have a holograph in my screen.
Restructuring. Read-out normal.
Security reports that drugs were added to the food intake of all four subjects.
The subjects are now asleep and available for pick-up at 2100 hours.
All subjects should be returned to their rooms by 0230.
Begin all graphic studies on my mark.
3,
2,
1,
mark.
I am reading the cytoplasmic structure now.
I want the chemical read-outs, as soon as you've got them.
Affirmative. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen readings are up.
Camino cytonic channels, hyperbilia, mitochondria, endoplasmic readings are recording.
Magnesium count.
1.7, sir.
Hematology, red cell mass, 2.0 liters.
Hematocrit, 0.44.
This is a time warning to all personnel.
It is now 0210.
All tests must be completed by 0215.
All subjects must be returned to their sleeping quarters by 0230.
Chuck!
- Chuck! Chuck!
- What's the matter?
Oh, I had this awful deram.
It was horrible.
I was in the hospital and these peopple kept hurting me.
And kept hurting me, and I couldn't do anything.
It's all right now, it's over.
Come and sit down.
Here you go, sit down.
I'm sorry, I feel like an idiot.
But... it was so real.
It's no problem. No problem at all.
What are you doing dressed?
Well, to tell the truth, I was on my way to take a little unauthorized tour.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
That could be dangerous.
Socks, I don't know if I've got a real story here or not.
But I'm not going to find out following Duffy around, you know?
If you're going, I'm going.
- Wrong. No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Just because I get mad at you doesn't mean I want to see you get hurt.
You stay here.
The minute you walk out that door,
I'm going to call Duffy.
Oh, you wouldn't do that.
Try me.
You are the most stubborn woman
I have ever met.
All right, hurry up, go up and change.
But don't take all night!
Where are we going?
Power plant.
What is that, anyway?
Looks like a road map to all the tunnel systems.
Well, is that good?
- That's bingo, Socks.
- Oh.
Come on, lets go.
It's a 400. It's programmed not to stop us.
- Are you sure?
- No!
That's it.
That's the entrance to the tunnels.
Yep, come on.
Are you sure you know where you're going?
- Not entirely.
- Oh, terrific.
Okay.
Where are we?
Right beneath the Research and Development area.
If they're keeping any secrets, this is where they ought to be.
Oh, boy.
Oh, yes. Duffy said they were building an Eastworld.
Duffy said a lot of things.
Come on.
What are you looking for anyway?
How the hell do I know?
I think we ought to get out of here.
Damn it, we just got here.
Just...
We got to get some light in here.
Hmm.
Hey, you don't know what you're doing.
Don't bother me.
I got an insinct for these things.
Turn it off. Will you turn it off?
Maybe they work in a combination.
How impressive.
Oh, for God's sake, let's get out of here.
You know this is about as exciting as a visit to the waterworks.
Oh, lighten up, Socks. Determination is a mark of a good reporter.
Chuck!
Come on!
Down!
- Go!
- Chuck!
Up, up!
Chuck!
Get out of here!
I can't hold it.
Let's go for the other chamber. Come on!
Find something to jam the wheel.
- Where shall I put it?
- Here, here.
Brace it on the table.
Let's get out of here.
What happened?
I don't know.
What the hell are you doing in there, anyway?
Come on out of there.
Is it safe?
You haven't died and gone to heaven, have you? Yeah, it's safe.
You can ckick them in the butt, they won't do nothing.
Come on!
Listen, I don't know how we can thak you.
Just hurry up. We'll do fine.
Ther'll be a whole damn army of iron here in a minute.
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.
Check the white chamber.
You come with me.
Okay, we're safe now.
They won't search down here?
No, no. No iron ever comes down here.
It's too wet for them.
Screws up their circuits.
We had a fire once, the sprinklers went off.
You should've seen them robots.
They were standing around like a bunch of drunks.
There's the power plant right up there.
You can go back the way you got here.
Listen, I would really like to talk to you.
I got nothing to say.
Well, we're reporters, see.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I've been watching you.
Well, what's your name?
Harry Croft.
Well, Mr. Croft, you're just the kind of man we've been looking for.
Someone who knows their way around this place and is not afraid to talk about it.
Now, wait a minute, I did you a favor, because I don't like to see anybody get into trouble.
But I got nothing to talk about.
Well, do you know who Miss Ballard is,
Mr. Croft?
She's a reporter, right?
Oh, hell, she's much more than a reporter.
She's a top television commentator.
She has her own show with 55 million viewers worldwide.
Now, she wants to inerview you for her program, right?
Yes, yes, I do.
What, me?
Well... I was here since the opening.
The first one, way, way back.
And I've seen it all.
That's it. Harry Croft, the man behind the iron mask at Delos.
- Yes.
- Would they see this in Cleveland?
They certainly will.
My mother's in Cleveland.
Hell, man, your mother's going to be proud of you.
I don't know.
All right.
Nobody here, sir.
All right, come with me.
I got a room up top, but... me and Clark, we like our little corner here best of all.
Ths is Clark.
Clark!
Well, hello, Clark.
He's an old 400 series
I saved from the junkyard.
You want some coffee? Booze?
Coffee would be wonderful.
What kind of booze do you have?
Any kind you want, long as it's gin.
Terrific.
Come on, sit down, make yourselves comfortable.
- Okay.
- Give me a coffee and a couple of gins.
And don't forget the ice.
You got to stay on top of him.
He gets a little sloppy sometimes.
Why do you call him Clark?
You know, from Superman,
Clark Kent, man of steel.
Is this his face?
Yeah... I kind of got tired of taking it off every time I had to fix him.
He don't mind.
Oh, it's a sad face.
Well, he used to work at the Roman World.
He was one of the original iron men in all the orgies.
He's seen a lot, Clark has.
It's wonder he can still move at all.
Thank you, Clark.
Yeah, well, I imagine you've seen some things yourself, Harry.
Well, you know.
You... develop a taste for the iron after a while.
It's good.
I remember one night.
Frenchy and I had a couple of girls up here from the Westworld. ooh-wee, we blew a few fuses that night, I'll tell you.
You said Frenchy.
Yeah, it's a guy that used to work here.
Why? Do you know Frenchy?
May I ask what you are doing here at this time of night?
Hi, there.
Yes, we couldn't sleep, wandered around, and found ourselves here.
Not very likely.
Are you calling the lady a liar?
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Harry was just telling us about the good old days.
He would have done better to remember that we do not encourage contact between our employees and our guests.
We're not your guests.
We're reporters.
You invited us here, remember?
So, you can save that line of crap for your robots, mister.
And Dr. Schneider, if we're not allowed to interview anybody we want, then I think that we just better leave Delos right now.
You can talk to anyone you wish.
I merely request that you inform Mr. Duffy and not sneak around at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Surely, that's not too much to ask.
Listen, I was just leaving anyway.
No, that's all right, Harry. It's late.
And I think that we're the ones that ought to be going.
If you follow me, I'll see you to your rooms.
- Chuck?
- Right.
Thanks, Harry, We'll see you.
Yeah, okay.
Clark, give me another gin.
What'd I tell you?
It never changes.
You get mixed up with people, all you got's trouble.
Good night.
Thanks for everything, Doc.
It's been a swell evening.
Mister, if this was your idea of a swell evening, you have got the wrong girl.
No, I don't, and one of these days you're going to be a hell of a reporter.
- What did I do?
- Come with me.
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Come on.
Harry spoke of a Frenchy, remember?
Yeah.
Well, this guy called Frenchy got himself killed trying to tell me about Delos.
Now, I never got the story.
But he was carrying these clippings about heavyweight people from every country on Earth.
You know, bankers and commissars, you name it.
I don't get the connection.
Well, I checked.
And each one of them was a guest at Delos.
Now, I smell a big rat.
But I want to talk to Harry alone and I'm going to need your help, Socks.
Oh, listen I don't know.
I mean, we keep breaking their rules, they're never going to let me back with a video crew.
Anyway, we promised that we would be fair.
Okay, you help me tomorrow. and if I don't get something solid from Harry, then I'll lay off, all right?
Okay, okay.
Hey, you were pretty terrific tonight, do you know that?
Oh, you weren't too shabby yoursef.
I bet you say that to all your copy boys.
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.
I don't.
Shuttle 10-4-3 is clear to proceed to Mars...
Please, expedite repair of the fountain.
4-2-7, do you copy?
We can see the fountain, and it is not functioning in its proper mode.
Do you copy?
4-2-7, please respond.
Yes, I copy, you miseralbe bag of bolts!
If you think you can do any better, get your iron butt down here, otherwise, shut up!
4-2-7, out.
We call it our Inner Space Chamber and we hope to make it a regular part of Futureworld.
The idea is to actually make a videotape of a dream.
You take it with you, play it back, find out what you're thinking about.
That is absolutely incredible.
- You want to try it?
- Go ahead, Socks, go for it.
Well, yes, yes, I do, you know.
Maybe I could use it on the program.
I think you'll find this a unique experience.
- Chuck, would you just wait here?
- You bet.
I gotta see this.
Wait a minute, you mean he can watch?
Unless you object.
Well, I don't know whether I do or not.
I mean, it depends on what I dream, doesn't it?
Well, don't you worry about it.
I won't tell anybody.
All right, wise guy.
It's about time you learned something about women.
- This way.
- Hmm.
Are you sure I won't have a nightmare?
I mean, this thing looks pretty frightening.
Well, we'll see to it that that doesn't happen.
The couch is designed to remove any pressure along the neural spinal column.
And the material bleeds air at the exact tempreature of your body.
So, you'll see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing.
Your mind will begin to feed on itself.
With my luck, I won't be able to fall asleep.
Bye.
Every thought, like every eye blink or a heartbeat releases currents of electricity, which can be transformed into waves.
She's got a lot on her mind, huh?
Well, we're recording 2,000 different waves from 5,000 separate brain locations.
- Wow.
- Millions of bits of information.
We take it all in... and put it back together.
On this.
- What's this?
- Take a look.
You know what you're seeing?
I can't believe it.
Well, it's true.
You're looking directly into her mind.
We've learned how to convert thought waves back into the images the mind creates.
It isn't perfect, of course.
It'll do. Wow.
Activate the pain-pleasure gradient, please.
Who's that?
- Reference?
- A fantasy lover.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
Start a video recording on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
We're losing it. She's waking up.
Better give her a moment.
Real life is a shock after that.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I call.
What'd you got?
I said I'll call.
Damn it, show me your cards!
I'll be go to hell.
All right, what'd you got?
Four kings, huh?
I find out you been cheating,
I'm gonna fry your wires.
All rght, it's my deal.
Five cards stud.
Jokers with aces, straights, and flushes.
Fool around, cheat this time.
All right, ante up!
All right, you just stay away, mister.
I'm in all the trouble I need because of you.
Is that Frenchy?
My God, what happened to him?
Somebody killed him.
I don't know why they'd want to do that.
He never hurt anybody.
What was his job?
He's a workman, same as I am.
He had a run-in with Dr. Schneider and he quit.
Or else he got fired, I don't know.
He talked to me just before he was killed.
He said he had the big story about Delos.
Do you know what he was talking about?
- Do you?
- Maybe.
Well, what?
Do you think they'll treat you any better?
Hmm?
I'm probably going to lose my job, because of this.
But I don't look like I got much of a future anyway.
Come on.
I got something to show you.
Don't you touch them cards.
You know there used to be a couple dozen maintenance men.
In each world.
Now it's all machines except for me and a couple other guys.
Everything changed after they brought out the 700s.
Changed how?
They're just different, that's all.
They think too much.
They don't think for themselves, do they?
No, no, they're iron just like the rest of them.
They don't go anywhere, do anything they're not programmed to.
- But...
- But they got you worried, huh?
- This is it.
- All right.
What is it?
Used to be dead inventory.
I don't know what it is now.
I know one thing. That's the only door in Delos I can't get in.
The only ones allowed in there are the 700s.
What's that?
Write down what I tell you.
Let's try it.
Yeah, I've tried it a dozen times.
I can't get in thoose doors.
Hell, one more time, Harry.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Give me those numbers.
I told you.
- You...?
- No, I don't smoke.
I tried that code every way I could.
I can't get in, just can't get in.
Well, maybe it's not the code, you know?
Maybe it's something else, something personal.
What do you mean?
Fingerprints or voice, you know?
700s haven't got no fingerprints.
Only way you can tell the difference between them is in their eyes.
That's it! Goddamn it, that's it!
Their eyes.
That light reads the circuitry in their eyes.
Come on!
Well, I hope you'll accept my apologies for Chuck's behavior.
I think he's just overtrained for a simple story like Delos.
Well, we're not worried. I'm sure he'll turn up sooner or later.
You know, I find that man, Harry, an interesting character.
I definitely want to use him on the show.
- Harry's one of our old boys.
- Ah.
Mr. Duffy feels sorry for him, but frankly, I think he should have been phased out long ago.
Well, why's that?
His skills are no longer needed.
Our 700s can do it better.
Oh, Mort, that's not entirely true.
We haven't solved the problem of wet areas.
Harry is still quite valuable.
Well, anyway, don't you think it's dangerous to rely too much on the robots?
Don't you think something could go wrong again?
Not at all.
Hey, iron ass!
Are you running correlates on organic emissions?
I have the resonance frequency on the protein molecules.
Electromagnetic shaping positive.
Subject beta-niner.
Energy matrix play out is particulating... now.
It's all right.
Do you know what it is?
Wasn't here before.
It's Karnovski.
Chuck, isn't that...?
It's Takaguchi.
Oh, my God, I don't beleive it.
- They're duplicates.
- What?
They are creating and programming duplicates of real people.
That's what Frenchy's list meant about the politicians and the commissars and the generals.
They've all been replaced by those things.
You'll start the family history program on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
Let us repeat our social attitude program, please.
And add a factor of 5 to the medulla circuit.
You will never harm Delos.
I will never harm Delos.
You will do what Delos instructs you to do.
I will do whatever Delos instructs me to do.
You will destroy your original.
I will destroy my original.
There's a plane leaving in about 3 hours.
We should get back to our rooms, get our stuff together, and get on that flight.
- Yeah, but what about Duffy?
- We'll call him from the airport.
- You know your way back from here?
- You bet.
I wouldn't stay in that room too long.
I don't beleve it's safe.
I'll meet you at the power plant in half an hour.
I know a place we can hide until the plane leaves.
Okay, but if we don't show, you get out best way you can.
- Good luck.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
I'll just be a minute.
All right, I'll try to get Holcombe, tell him what happened.
Operator, I want to make a person-to-person call to Arthur Holcombe,
International Media Corporation.
Right, 7-2-5,
Yeah, sure, I'll wait.
Put the phone down, Chuck.
You're a part of it?
Yes, of couse, I am.
Now, where is Miss Ballard?
She's with Harry.
They're supposed to meet me here.
Well, I suppose it's possible that ocasionally even a newspaper reporter tells the truth.
We'll just go upstairs and check, shall we?
Why are you doing this?
Oh, that should be obvious.
If you read your own newspaper more carefully, you'd understand our position quite easily.
The human being is a very unstable, irrational, violent animal.
Now, hold it.
All our probability studies indicate that if left alone, you'll destroy much of this planet before the end of the decade.
Now, we at Delos are determined to seeing that doesn't happen.
We don't intend to be destroyed by your mistakes.
So, you're replacing human leaders with your own duplicates, huh?
Yes. With duplicates who are programmed to think first of the welfare of Delos and to accept our instructions.
Downstairs.
Why bother with Tracy or me?
Because we need the favorable publicity to attract the top rank of human leadership.
The stories your duplicates create will guarantee that every Chief of State will soon be among our guests.
You can't possibly succeed.
We can and we will.
Look, don't imagine that these duplicates we've created are mere robots.
They are not machines.
They are living beings produced by the genetic information in your own cells.
There are no mechanical parts.
Even those of us who create them can't tell the original from the duplicate.
Jesus!
Shoot him!
Shoot him! I can't hold him!
Now!
What are you doing?
He was much too strong.
What do we do now?
Well, we can't stay here.
What about Westworld?
That was deserted.
Yeah, good idea.
You know I'd take you with me, don't you?
You know that.
It just... It wouldn't work out.
I mean, people on the outside, they just... they never would understand how it is with us.
The hell with them.
When we get this thing straightened out,
I'll be back to get you.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.
You been a good pal to me.
I'm gonna sure miss you.
Watch out for the bad circuit in your arm, you hear?
You got to be careful now.
So long, you ol' bag of bolts.
We'll see you.
Okay.
You wait by the barn.
I'm going to get Harry and be right back.
Okay, look.
- You be careful.
- You bet.
- Go on.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Where is Tracy?
- She's safe.
- Great, let's go.
Don't hurry, Chuck.
I'll find you.
Chuck? Chuck?
Hello, Tracy.
Why! Well, you... You can't be.
But I am.
What are you?
You.
Don't run there.
You were going to run to the saloon and hide in the gap between the floorboard and the ground.
How can... How can you know that?
Because I have your mind.
And what you think, I think and what you know, I know.
And now it's too late to run, because we're both within accurate range of these guns.
Yes, I... Yes, I just... I just thought of that.
Yes, I know you did.
It's a good thing Father taught us how to shoot, isn't it?
Yes.
Maybe we shouldn't have worried so much about whether he loved us or not.
No... He was just busy, I guess.
Yes.
Well, it's been good to meet you.
But of course... there can only be one of us.
- Yes.
- And since... since you can read my mind.
I can read yours.
Yes.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, this isn't going to get us anywhere, you know?
We're both lousy shots.
Remember Sergeant Rucker at basic?
Browning, you couldn't hit an elephant in the ass at 5 yards with a bazooka.
Be careful, brother.
Don't forget we're afraid of heights.
Oh, good.
Damn good, really.
Well, Chuck, it's been fun.
But I've got a plane to catch and a story to write.
You know what I mean?
Anyway, don't feel too bad.
You're not going to die, exactly.
Just going to be replaced.
I thought I'd see you off personally.
Thank you.
It's just been a fabulous time, really.
I look forward to coming back with a video crew next week.
Really, it was just a wonderful time.
And I hope you'll thank Mr. Duffy for us.
I certainly will.
What about you, Chuck?
Have we satisfied your suspicions?
I'd like to apologize for that.
But I think your patience with me will be rewarded.
I intend to write a story that will make everyone who can afford it, a Delos customer.
Your attention, please.
- That's wonderful.
- Laker Airways anounces the departure
of flight 936 for New York
- Wonderful.
- and San Fransico.
This is the final call for...
Oh, that's us.
- Let's go.
- So long, Doc.
All aboard, please.
They are the... the wrong ones.
Did you talk to Arthur?
Yeah, told him the whole story.
It'll be old news by the time we get home.
Hey, you know, I still don't think that kissing you was a very scientific way of finding out who was who.
Well, there are some things you just can't fake, Socks.
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.
Yeah!
That's a pretty one!
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one, over there.
Oh, that's beautiful. Let me look at that.
Let me look at that!
Now you can take them home to your parents. Don't they smell nice!
Hi.
Too much trouble to pick the mail up off the floor, Geoffrey?
Hello?
Look at this flower.
All right! Attaway!
You know, I think I actually found something rare.
What?
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?
G-R-E-X. That's when two species cross-pollinate and produce a third completely unique one.
And listen to this:
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi: upon, and lobos: a pod."
"Many of the species are dangerous weeds and should be avoided."
Dangerous?
In the garden.
See? Look how quickly it roots.
"Their rapid and widespread growth was even observed in many of the war-torn cities of Europe."
"lndeed, some of these plants may thrive on devastated ground."
Why don't we go up to Vail for the weekend? Fly up Friday, hm?
OK, maybe. Sure.
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!
You're in a good mood.
Well, I got something to look forward to tonight - playoffs.
Geoffrey.
- What?
- I'm reading.
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?
Never mind. I'll go downstairs.
Comment? Qui est là?
Who is it?
Department of Health.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bennell.
How nice to see you.
What is that supposed to be?
It is cervelles en matelote.
In English, what would I be eating if I ate that?
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?
Mais, c'est impossible. It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.
You don't have any secrets from the Department of Health, Henri.
A good young Burgundy, brown stock, thyme, parsley - just a sprig.
Capers,... a fresh bay leaf, and garlic.
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.
- What is that?
- A caper.
No.
Do you presume to tell us what is in this stock?
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?
A rat turd.
- A caper!
- A rat turd.
A caper!
If it's a caper, eat it.
I'm gonna bring you up for permit revocation, Henri.
You're charging way too much to be serving crap like that in here.
But, Monsieur, it is an accident.
You know how careful we are.
Hello?
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.
- Wake you up?
- No. Hi, Matthew.
- They busted the window of my car.
- Oh, no!
Threw a bottle of wine at it - not even good wine.
The Warriors won, so I guess your household's happy.
Yes.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
If you go to sleep now, you can get up early.
Oh, Matthew...
If you can come in at 7.30, you can run the tests before 8 o'clock.
Stop! Matthew... stop.
I'm not coming in before 8 o'clock
- in the morning!
- I gotta force the abatement hearing.
- Wednesday's their only free slot.
- No, Matthew!
I will not be there before eight!
I nominated you for
Civil Servant ofthe Year award.
It's true. I think you'll win.
OK, OK, OK. I'll be in at 7.30.
I'll run a salmonella test for you.
Thank you. See you in the morning.
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Geoffrey, my God!
How long have you been up?
Not long.
What are you doing?
Geoffrey?
I wanna throw the book at him. Those scallops are just cut-up pieces of skate.
I'm sorry. I can start the tests right away.
It's OK...
And something's wrong with the potato.
Either the sour cream is phoney, or the chives.
I'm sorry. I got up on time.
It was Geoffrey.
- What did the mad dentist do this time?
- I don't know. He was just weird.
He's crazy. All dentists are crazy.
- Are you late?
- No.
He was weird not the way he usually is.
That can only be an improvement.
Well, it's not. It's got me really nervous.
Tell him to shape up or get out.
- It's his house.
- Make him an offer.
- Here's something that'll cheer you up.
- What?
Ever seen one of these up close?
- What is it?
- What does it look like?
- A caper?
- A caper?
What is it?
- A rat turd, but the sauce was delicious.
- I got you a rat.
- Did you find one?
- I've got it. It was a biggie.
OK, we'll get a declaration of "unsanitary" on him.
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- OK.
- What can I do?
- Nothing. Don't worry. Go on.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey, come on. Tell me what I've done.
- I understand today's plan.
Something's come up, Elizabeth.
I have to go back out again.
Now? Weren't we going to the game?
The Warriors.
I gave the tickets to a patient.
You're not gonna see tonight's game?
No choice.
Geoffrey, what is the matter with you?
I'm fine. I just have to go to a meeting.
Meeting? What kind of a meeting?
Elizabeth, I don't think
I have to justify my every move to you.
Geoffrey, this isn't like you.
Please, come on. I just want it to be nice...
Elizabeth, what's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Come in!
Hi.
How you doing?
Is it true that if you think you're losing your mind, you're not?
Well, I hope so.
I know this is gonna sound insane.
What?
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.
- How do you know?
- I know.
On the outside Geoffrey is still Geoffrey, but on the inside
I can tell there is something different.
Something is missing.
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.
He's just not the same person.
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.
Yeah. I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some celery.
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.
We can eat outside. It's a beautiful night.
Take that meat there, will you?
Chop it up.
And hand me the ginger, the stuff that's chopped up there.
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.
I went to see his sister Nora to talk to her about it.
But I couldn't. I stopped myself.
She changed, too?
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.
D'you wanna go see my friend David Kibner?
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.
Talk to him. He would put things into perspective.
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.
He would eliminate whether Geoffrey was having an affair, or had become gay.
Whether he had a social disease, or had become a Republican.
All the things that could have happened to have made you feel he had changed.
D'you know what I mean?
You wanna go see him?
You think I'm nuts.
No, I don't.
Can you still do the thing with your eyes?
If you're not crazy, you can do that thing with your eyes.
You're not crazy.
This is delicious.
You're a great cook.
What time is Geoffrey getting back?
He said not to wait up for him.
D'you want some more wine?
- Morning!
- Hello.
One, two... Mrs Teng, this one's got a coffee stain on it.
Here.
- That's not coffee.
- That is coffee. I put it there myself.
Maybe not come out.
You doctor, right?
Me? No. Health Department. Civil servant.
Do you need a doctor?
My wife... sick.
- What's wrong with her?
- She wrong.
- She's not right?
- That not my wife.
You mean, she's...?
No, no. Different.
That not my wife!
How you doin', Harry?
Hey, pooch. How you doin', boy?
Where you been? You've been driving me crazy. I've been looking all over for you.
What's the matter with you?
You all right?
Talk to me, Elizabeth.
I keep seeing these people all recognising each other.
Something was passing between them all.
Some secret.
It's a conspiracy. I know it.
There can't be a conspiracy.
Matthew, I'm telling you, something's going on here.
Something that scares me.
I tried to see Geoffrey today, to talk to him.
He's always in his office in the morning.
It really was weird.
Geoffrey was meeting all sorts ofstrange people.
Things were being passed between them.
- None were people you knew?
- I didn't know any of them.
Maybe they were patients of Geoffrey's.
Oh, no, no, Matthew. I know they weren't.
I followed him from one end oftown to the other, and everywhere he went he had these meetings with strange people.
I felt so stupid sneaking around spying on him, but I can't talk to him. What can I do?
OK. Well, Kibner will be able to explain something.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.
Just think of him as an intelligent man, which is what he is.
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.
He's very famous.
And you will like him, if you forget that he's a psychiatrist.
I don't know... I don't know.
Matthew, I've lived in this city all my life, but somehow today
I felt everything had changed.
People were different.
Notjust Geoffrey, but everybody.
Yesterday it all seemed normal.
Today everything seemed the same, but it wasn't.
It was a nightmare.
It really became frightening.
It was like the whole city had changed overnight.
Did I ever tell you the one about the English Camel Corps? Did l?
They're trapped in the desert, in the Sahara desert.
They've been surrounded by Rommel for 40 days and they've run out of food.
And the captain comes and makes an announcement to the men.
He says,
"Men, I have some good news and some bad news for you."
- One of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this.
Can I tell it to you again?
Look out!
Oh, my God! Lock the door!
- They're coming!
- We should help.
Help! Help! They're coming.
They're coming. Listen!
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.
You're next. Please! Please!
You're next. We're in danger!
Listen to me... Something terrible!
Please. You're next!
Here they are. They're already here!
Help! You're next!
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.
The policeman'll help.
Oh, my God.
That poor man.
What was he talking about?
I'll phone a witness report in from the bookstore.
Matthew, thank God you're here!
These people are driving me nuts.
- Are we gonna have dinner?
- No, I can't.
- Is there a phone?
- Around the corner.
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?
The book is awful. Kibner's book is awful.
His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.
How can you say that about a man like Kibner?
Not a man like Kibner.
I'm saying it about Kibner.
He dashes a book off every six months.
Takes me six months to write one line.
- Why?
- Cos I pick each word individually.
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was l?
On the corner of Leavenworth and...
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.
Is that him?
Yes.
Yes!
"What's so hot about that?
What's so hot about that?" I don't know...
You must have a report on it cos there was a motorcycle officer there
- and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.
- They don't understand me.
- You don't have to prove yourself to them.
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.
Just a second. I'm talking to the police.
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble?
Hello? Yeah.
Don't ever give your name to cops.
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.
But he isn't my husband!
It's someone who looks like him.
He's an impostor!
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.
You know him and I know him.
I had to wait until today cos he has a scar on the back of his neck and when his hair is long you can't see it.
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.
No! It's still there!
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.
- I know something...
- Katherine?
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!
Just a minute.
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?
Will you trust me?
Will you please trust me? Will you?
I work for the county.
This is a public-spirited gesture.
- I will give you my name...
- Kibner wants people to fit the world.
- I wanna report this.
- I want the world to fit people.
- We'll talk about this later.
- Where's Homer? Or Kazantzakis?
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know.
I understand. Let me have your hand.
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?
Come on.
There. That's not so bad, is it?
Who's this behind me?
- It's Ted.
- That's right.
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.
Hold on. Just relax now.
- You gonna be all right? You feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.
Tomorrow we'll all talk.
OK? The three of us?
OK, but I better take her home.
Yes. It's OK.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.
- All right?
- OK.
Thank you.
They don't wanna hear about the accident.
It's a big conspiracy.
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.
Excuse me.
I understand what you're trying to say.
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll, the Public Health Department. Call me.
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.
That woman's husband is not her husband.
I saw him with Geoffrey. He's one of them.
She knows about it
- and nobody's helping her.
- No. Somebody's helping her.
I'm glad you heard that. David, Elizabeth.
I've heard it all week. It's popular.
- What is?
- I was trying to tell you
- that I also know somebody...
- Who's changed.
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?
Listen, there's a lady up top - red hair, blue dress. She's interested in your work.
I've heard the same damn story this week from six patients.
People are changing, becoming less human.
It's happening all around us.
That's not what we're talking about.
This has nothing to do with the man I live with.
It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see?
People step in and out of relationships because they don't want responsibility.
That's why marriages are going to hell.
The family unit is shot to hell.
- David, you're not listening to her.
- Stay out of this!
You see, that's the point.
I'm listening, but he doesn't think I am. Why?
Because he doesn't expect me to bother enough, or to care.
- Bellicec, for the last time, stop!
- Stop what?!
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!
How did you feel about that?
Why in the store? He's a nut.
How did you feel?
You were probably shocked.
You wanted to shut your feelings off, maybe make believe it wasn't happening cos then you don't have to deal with it.
I wanna deal with that woman in the bookstore.
Why?
Do you identify with her?
Yes.
OK.
Come on.
Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine is trying to escape from a relationship.
- He's treating her.
- So why'd he push me against a wall?
- She's upset.
- She looks fine.
- She is upset, Jack.
- You look upset to me now.
Do me a favour, will ya?
Go home and I'll call you later.
- Go home and leave us alone for a bit.
- Go home?
- OK?
- OK. OK.
Thank you.
You're jumping to a bizarre conclusion.
That this man you live with has been replaced by somebody else.
Isn't it more likely you want to believe he's changed because you're really looking for an excuse to get out?
I don't know.
Will you think about it, please, before you make a move?
Before you jump and destroy something you have. Will you?
Please?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I just gave her a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.
I should talk to her some more.
You could bring her by my office tomorrow around four.
What's the matter with her?
It's like there's some kind of hallucinatory flu going around.
People get over it in a day or two.
All I can do is treat the symptoms.
She's gonna be OK?
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.
I was just wondering if the Health Department should look at it.
Who knows? I don't know.
I wish I did.
OK.
Take her home, Matthew.
Ah, Jack. How was the book party?
Is that Kibner's new book?
Didn't get to read your poetry?
I'm sorry, Jack.
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.
Yes, we recommend the 1 5-minute soak in Calistoga volcanic ash, that's followed by an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.
Hey, can you help me outta here?
Bellicec!
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.
Help me outta this thing.
Stan...
Every week we go through this.
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.
You are really gonna get hurt one of these days.
Give me another towel, would you?
Come on.
Nancy, shut the music off.
It's for the plants, Stan.
Screw the plants. I hate the music.
It's wonderful for my plants.
They just love it.
Plants have feelings, you know, just like people.
It's fascinating. This type of music stimulates the growth of the plants.
They've done tons of experiments on it.
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.
You're not gonna enjoy this if you don't.
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.
Worlds ln Collision by Velikovsky.
Oh, yes. I've read that many times.
Have you read Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon?
That's must reading, too.
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr Gianni.
- You're so smart.
Oh, Mr Gianni, you've been sitting in that mud too long.
It is possible to overdo it, you know.
Oh, by the way, thank you for that plant you gave me last time.
I'll walk you inside.
You don't have to.
Geoffrey?
That was sweet of him.
You all right?
I'll see you tomorrow morning.
Thank you, Matthew.
You've really made me feel better.
And I'm gonna think about what Kibner said.
OK.
Thanks for helping. Goodnight.
See you.
Jack?
Honey, where are ya?
I don't wanna disturb you if you're thinking, but I could do with some food.
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.
My nose...
Let me out! Let me out!
My nose is bleeding.
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's Matthew.
- Come on in.
- What happened?
Back here.
- Matthew, I called you here as a friend.
- Oh, Jack...
Do you report things like contagious disease or a body in a place of business?
- Let him look at it.
- You found a body?
- No, not necessarily.
- I thought it was Jack.
Is that him?
Yeah, under there.
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.
What is it?
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.
Is it contagious?
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.
It'd ruin us.
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't do that.
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.
Because I think Jack is right.
It's not immature exactly.
He's got an adult face.
- It's a monster. It's got hair all over it.
- It's vague.
Nose, lips, hair.
Hands, everything, but no detail, no character. It's unformed.
Jack, don't touch it.
You don't know where it's been.
No respiration.
It's got no fingerprints.
No fingerprints?
Like a foetus.
You just said it was an adult.
I said it was an adult because it was tall.
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.
- How much do you weigh?
- Why?
- Oh, no.
No, Matthew.
Oh, Jack!
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.
Why?
Why are you calling Elizabeth?
- Matthew...
- Why?
Hello?
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?
It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?
What's the matter?
Elizabeth, can you hear me?
Who is this?
Hello?
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.
Ask him to meet me here right away.
There's his number.
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.
Stand up.
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.
I'll get you a drink. Just don't fall asleep.
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.
Dr Kibner will be here soon.
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.
I'm just gonna think.
Jack, wake up! lts eyes!
Oh, Jack. It opened its eyes.
See?
Hon?
Wake up.
Wake up!
I can't find anything in here that looks like a body.
- No body?
- What!
- Did you check the last...
- I looked everywhere.
Hey! Did you... Hey!
- Did you check the last booth on the left?
- There's no body there.
It's got to be in here!
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.
It had white hair, that touched my hand.
There's something in here.
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.
Face it, Bellicec.
You've got some friends who enjoy practical jokes.
I don't have any friends, Dr Kibner.
Then some enemies.
Look.
Who opened this up?
Wait a second, wait a second.
Who is it?
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?
Police? I would like to report a body.
Take her to my place fast.
Don't let anybody in until we get back there.
Lieutenant, these fellas reported the body.
- You both saw it?
- No, I'm the only one. Matthew Bennell.
- Mr Bennell, show me where you saw it.
- It's right up here.
Where's Elizabeth?
- Where?
- There.
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where?
Lots of leaves and a pot.
It was there, David.
I swear to God it was there!
Officer, there was a duplicate of Elizabeth Driscoll,
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?
- She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him that!
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.
- There is and he's taken it!
- No, he took Elizabeth.
- You took Elizabeth away?
- Yes!
- You broke in here.
- I had to because she was not safe here.
So you took her out of here.
No! I took her from there.
Her other body was in here...
Please stop.
Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!
- Lieutenant, I'm Dr David Kibner.
- Ah, the psychiatrist.
My wife reads your books.
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated,...
- David...
..but my friend has had some difficult emotional experiences recently.
But I think this is something we can work out amongst ourselves.
- All right, I'll leave this part of it with you.
- I appreciate it.
You can't accomplish anything here.
We gotta get outside.
I think you might wanna consider filing an unlawful entry against Mr Bennell.
I know what you're saying, but outside...
No, I'll take Dr Kibner's word that Elizabeth is all right.
- Fine, then let's go.
- OK.
Will Elizabeth be coming home?
No.
I have to pick up some of her clothes.
All right.
All right, let's back up and go through it once more, step by step.
You all thought you saw a body at the baths.
You thought it was dead.
You didn't know what it was.
You touched it. All of you touched it.
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.
- And, Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.
If you saw its nose bleed, and Nancy saw its eyes open, he must have been alive.
No, David. You're looking at it as if it was human. It was not human.
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.
- It had white hair on it.
- It was growing.
The one at Jack's was...
It was like Jack, but not as developed as the one at Elizabeth's place.
It had tendrils on it.
The one at her place was duplicating her.
If Matthew hadn't taken me away, the same thing that's happened to Geoffrey would have happened to me.
Elizabeth, would you please tell me, in your opinion, exactly what is happening?
People are being duplicated.
And once it's happened to you, you're part of this thing.
It almost happened to me!
Look, the reason you don't believe Elizabeth is because the other body disappeared.
It disappeared because Geoffrey took it.
Well, then what happened to my other body, then?
Oh, people, will you please listen to yourselves?
Will you listen to what you are saying?
I can deal with a body being moved and even with a body getting up and leaving, but when you start talking about his other body, being duplicated...
Listen to how that sounds.
We know how insane this sounds!
But what do you think we're doing?
Do you think we're making it up?
Do you believe that my body looked like me and that her body looked like her?
D'you think we're crazy?
You are trying to make us believe that we are seeing things. Why?
All I'm trying to do is help.
You call me in the middle of the night and ask me to help. That's all I'm trying to do.
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up!
If we inconvenienced you,
I guess we owe you an apology.
I mean, I mean...
I guess that's a rotten thing to do!
You've upset my wife, too.
David, I don't know what it is or where it comes from, but I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.
Matthew, my friend,... I believe you.
I've known you too long not to believe you.
What do you wanna do?
Well, if I could get official support,
I'd institute the emergency procedures that we use for cholera or legionnaires' disease.
- What do you want me to do?
- I can handle the Health Department.
But if panic breaks out, we'll need the police and the Guard, and that means the Mayor and...
The Mayor's a patient of yours, isn't he?
How did you know that?
What do you want me to do?
Would you ask him to accept my telephone call?
I'll call him in a hour. I'll be at my office.
If you have any other ideas, get in touch.
Call me.
Thank you.
The sooner the better.
This smells lovely.
- I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.
I am not seeing things.
I know I saw what I saw and I know it was turning into you, Jack.
Now, that body we found...
That flower. Where did you get that?
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.
So what?
A customer, Mr Gianni, brought one of those to the baths.
So what?
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.
- I could not find that flower in any book.
- Jack, put it down.
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.
I have seen these flowers all over.
They grow like parasites on other plants.
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not?
- They're not.
- Why?!
What are you talking about?
A space flower?
Why not a space flower?
Why do we always expect metal ships?
I've never expected metal ships.
There must be other ways they get in our systems.
Right. They could be getting into us through touch or fragrance.
We would never even notice it, not from the impurities we have.
I mean, we eat junk and we breathe junk.
I don't know where they're coming from, but I feel as though I've been poisoned.
We've gotta take those flowers in and have them analysed.
- There's something here.
- They could get into us and screw up our genes like DNA, recombine us, change us.
Oh, of course!
This is the same way those rockets landed years ago, so those spacemen could mate with monkeys and create the human race.
It's happening now!
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- David Kibner.
He's not in right now.
He'll be back this afternoon.
Could you leave a message for him?
Matthew Bennell. B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.
James Grala, Deputy City Attorney.
Can I help you?
My name is Matthew Bennell.
B-E-N-N-E-L-L.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.
- Is this another call about impostors?
- Yes.
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.
Good. Listen, Mr Bennell, we don't wanna create a panic.
No-one here knows.
I'd like you to stay by yourphone for a while.
I'll have somebody call you back and take down all you know.
All right, thank you.
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth.
We don't test flowers.
- They go to the Depart of Agriculture.
- I know where they go!
I think this is our problem.
I think it is affecting people.
How?
Look, Allen, I have already said that I'll do all the testing.
You don't have to lift a finger. Can l?
You've been consistently late, Elizabeth, and you're behind in your work, so I'll do the tests for you.
Thank you.
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.
I can't understand why you've become so emotional about a little flower.
Hello.
- Mr Bennell?
- Yes.
- From the Health Department?
- Yes.
- It's Ted Jessop, the Mayor's assistant.
- Yes.
- You've come across something strange?
- Yes.
I'd like to suggest we meet in Union Square.
- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,
Mr Bennell?
Yeah.
Don't say a word to anyone. Keep it quiet.
Whatever you say.
- Please deposit 15 cents.
- Operator, I put in a quarter...
This is Judy Hinkell, the Mayor's special assistant.
Yes. My name is Matthew Bennell.
The Mayor's in conference, but Dr Kibner called him personally to express his concern.
And, Mr Bennell, we're asking for your discretion because this thing might be abating.
Hello?
- Matthew Bennell?
- Yes.
I'm Michaels, from the Federal Preparedness Agency.
These reports ofstrange, unexplained, diseased bodies.
My understanding is you haven't analysed anything
- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...
Mr Bennell, it seems you'rejust winging your conclusions. Keep an open mind.
I had no intention...
Don't mention to anyone about duplicate bodies.
- I was gonna treat it...
- Excuse me, my otherphone is ringing.
- Yes?
- This is serious business, Mr Bennell.
- Is thisjust a case ofparanoia?
- No, no, no.
Know what mass hysteria looks like,
Mr Bennell?
- We don't want to create a panic.
- We have a primary authority.
Be cautious.
You sound distressed.
- I think the horizon looks bright.
- People are returning to normal.
No, no. She all right.
She better now. Much better now.
- Did your husband ask you to come?
- No, no.
I want everybody to see that I'm back to myself again.
No, wait. Please.
I'll see you soon, I hope.
Matthew, I'm not getting a thing here.
Where is the...
I'm not getting any news here.
Isn't there a 24-hour news?
I would think you'd have a good reception on the hill.
There's a repair truck out here.
Could that be to do with it?
She just needs something to help her sleep. Tomorrow she'll be good as new.
I would suggest you get some sleep, too.
You've done everything you possibly can.
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?
No, I'm not going back there.
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.
Thank you.
Come on.
I appreciate everything you've done,
David. Thank you.
- Get some sleep.
- Sure. See you.
Matthew. Matthew.
Matthew, they're growing.
They're everywhere!
Wake the others!
Elizabeth, wake up!
They're growing out of these pods.
- I'll get the police.
- Elizabeth, wake up.
They get you when you sleep. Sit up!
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, would you wake up?
Hello. Police.
Officer, I would like to report four bodies in my backyard.
You OK?
- Wait there, Mr Bennell.
- How do you know my name?
Hang up, Matthew.
- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.
They're all pods, all of them.
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.
The CIA? The FBl? They're pods already.
I've got a friend in the Justice Department.
I can dial direct.
- What are you gonna tell him?
- Oh, my God!
They grow out of those pods!
They cut our power.
Matthew, they're barricading the street.
No!
- What number are you calling from?
- Operator? I was dialling direct.
I'll try the number, Mr Bennell.
- They're coming up here.
- Hang up, Matthew.
Matthew, do you have a gun?
No.
- What are we gonna do?
- Out the back door.
Hurry up! Jack!
That way. Under the stairs.
Go on. I'll catch up with you.
Go on, keep on running! Don't stop!
Go on!
Quickly. Follow me.
We're being cornered!
Jesus!
Get down!
Matthew, keep them here and I'll come back with help.
Jack.
- Jack!
- No, Nancy.
- No, Jack! Jack!
- Get down.
Here I am, you pod bastard!
Hey, pods!
Come and get me, you scum!
Wharf area is secure. Ten-four.
Suspects escaping. Suspects escaping.
Oh, yeah, showtime!
Yes, sir, you're walking the right way.
We got nude girls...
It's all going on right here.
It's all live, it's all naked, sir.
Guaranteed action here.
Guaranteed to make you feel like a new man.
Come on back here! Come on back here!
D'you hear me? Come on back here!
This is it.
We got male and female love back here...
- Where to?
- The airport.
Pacific and Hyde. Pacific and Hyde.
6-10 proceeding south to airport, carrying two passengers, type H.
- Repeat. Type H.
- 6-10, confirmed.
Some night, eh?
- Take 280 south on ramp.
- Yeah.
Type H unit established in Financial and South ofMarket.
Repeat. Financial and South ofMarket.
Lombard on the Golden Gate.
Where are you heading?
I said. The airport.
No. I mean which airline.
- Market and 14th. Market and 14th.
- United.
You got business outta town?
No, we're not leaving. We're meeting someone coming in from Boston.
All fares at North Beach, regroup.
Divisadero and Haight. Divisadero and Haight. Divisadero and Haight.
What is it?
What's going on?
Oh, nothing.
Both of 'em.
- Harry, pooch, wake up!
- Look, there's a pod.
All those with families in Berkeley, Oakland and Elizabeth.
Unit Seven, special assistance.
Could we have you over by the Health Department?
Red city, please.
All with red city families.
Look at them!
Right out in the open.
That's how they do it.
That's how they spread it.
All those people are changed.
Unit Seven, special assistance.
Could we have you over by the Health Department immediately?
Matthew, we'll never be able to stop them!
Yes, we will.
We can't!
Look it, they control the whole city.
We'll find a way somehow.
Oh, Matthew, I can't go on!
I wanna go to sleep.
I can't stay awake any more.
You have to.
You have to stay awake.
Would somebody in transportation report to the Grove Street terminal?
Yup. Boccardo's pills.
He eats these like candy... or he used to.
Take some.
- What are they?
- Speed. It'll keep us awake.
- How many are you supposed to take?
- It says "Take one".
Take five.
They know we're here.
Jack, my God!
No.
Would have been a lot easier if we'd just gone to sleep last night.
David, no!
- Oh, my God! No! No! Matthew!
- Don't touch her!
David, don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her!
Don't let them touch her.
- What are you gonna do?
- We'll leave the city!
- Please, Geoffrey.
- David, let us go.
- Let us leave the city!
- You don't have to leave the city.
Nothing changes.
You can have the same life.
But what happens to us?
You'll be born again into an untroubled world, free of anxiety, fear,...
- Wait.
- ..hate.
- David, you're killing us.
- That's not true. David's right.
Your minds and memories'll be totally absorbed. Everything remains intact.
You've never agreed with him in your life before! What are you talking about?
What are you...
David, you're killing me.
- What is this supposed to do?
- Just a mild sedative to help you sleep.
- I hate you.
- We don't hate you.
There's no need for hate now... or love.
I love you, Matthew.
There are people who will fight you.
They'll stop you.
In an hour... you won't want them to.
Don't be trapped by old concepts.
You're evolving into a new life form.
Come and watch.
We came here from a dying world.
We drift through the universe from planet to planet, pushed on by the solar winds.
We adapt... and we survive.
- The function of life is survival.
- Elizabeth!
Open the freezer, quick.
- This door?
- Yup.
Shut the door.
How are we gonna get outta here?
Through the door. Come on.
What's that?
I've lost Jack.
We got separated.
I don't know where he is. I've looked everywhere. Have you seen him?
Nancy, this building is surrounded.
How did you get in?
I've been wandering among 'em for hours.
They can be fooled.
How?
Don't show any emotions.
Hide your feelings.
- And when you sleep?
- We'll watch over each other.
- OK.
- Let's find Jack.
We're going to beat them. OK?
OK.
Hey! The lines are over there.
XB-25. XB-25. Station 5. Come in.
Yes. Station 5. Proceeding as per plan B. Awaiting Kibner unit.

That's for loading or unloading.
Get them! Get them!
Get them!
Come on, get up.
Oh, God!
You see them?
This is where they grow them.
This is where they cultivate them.
It's enormous.
What are we gonna do?
There are so many.
We've got to figure out a way of stopping them.
Can you walk?
- I'll try.
- Here, hold on to me and try and walk.
Oh, God! Are you all right?
A factory...
They're growing them.
Elizabeth.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
Come on.
Oh, I can't. I can't!

Elizabeth, no! No!
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up!
I love you.
The boat's there, Elizabeth.
The boat's there.
It's gonna take us away.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
They were right.
It's painless.
It's good.
Come.
Sleep.
He must be here somewhere.
Let's go this way.
- He must be around here somewhere.
- There's one over here, I think.
- We'll get him.
- We'll get him.
He can't stay awake for ever.

Subtitles: Yucatán Verbatim
Imagine ...
... imagine that your life is spent in an environment of total, physical sensation. and everyone of your senses has been heightened to a level that in a human being...
...might only be described as ecstatic.
That you are able to see ...
...to perceive, with every part of your being. seeing, hearing, taste, smell ...
...and every inch of your surface, your skin,
... is a receptor.
A continuous source of perfectly accurate information about the world for miles around.
Imagine ...
... That you are able to carry on simultaneous conversations with two members of your species, one right next to you, and the other several miles away.
Listen to the language ...
...intricate patterns of clicks, whistles, squeaks and groans.
Sounds, subtle enough to convey complicated factual data,
Complex enough, perhaps to deal with... abstractions,
...what we would call, ideas.
His brain...
...is a big as a man's.
It processes information about two worlds.
The world of water where it is born and feeds, and reproduces, and dies...
... and the world of air, in which he breathes.
He has few natural enemies.
Shark, Barracuda ...
...the fisherman who doesn't care what he catches, and certain, clumsy scientists...
... who believe that the easiest path to an animals brain is made with a scalpel.
As tragic and senseless as that kind of death can be ...
...so is his birth a moment of inspiration.
That’s why I thought I would close my report to you today...
... with this piece of film, which shows our first dolphin, born in captivity.
His tail comes out first ...
That's so his spiracle, that’s the hole on top of his head, from which he breathes,
...can come out last.
Then rushes to the surface to the air.
Watch closely, because, this happens rather quickly.
There.
Well, that was Alpha's birth.
He's now almost 4 years old...
...and we think he is very bright.
That's all, unless there are any questions.
Doctor Terrell ...
Did you say Alpha?
Yes we call him Alpha, because he's the first, the first dolphin born at the center.
It’s a little bit pretentious perhaps, but rather than spot, or rover, actually, we call him Fa.
Is the Alpha still with his mother?
No, ah, Alpha's mother died shortly after giving birth...
... We don't know why.
We raised him ourselves.
My wife and associate, Margaret Anderson and I, have spent the major part of the last 4 years... living with him, feeding him, teaching him.
Teaching him what?
Well we are concentrating on certain experiments,
Trying to learn certain things from Alpha,
Things that have to do with, oh, measurements, and intelligence, and so forth.
Doctor Terrell ...
... is it possible ...
I mean like I read somewhere...
... that the dolphins are as intelligent, as we are?
Well it depends on your definition of intelligence.
His brain contains a sonar system that's amazingly sophisticated.
For instance it enables him to distinguish...
...from enormous distances, between objects of fractionally different sizes,
Or between, different kinds of metal,
...or between organic, and inert matter.
Dr. Terrell...
...what about the experiments of the military...
I don't know anything about military.
But certainly you've heard about the misuse of animals like dolphins that the government...
Just a moment please.
I'm not a political scientist ...
My degrees are in biology, and zoology and behavioral psychology ...
... government and I pay very little attention to each other.
Well, doctor, what is it, exactly, that you hope to learn from all these studies?
I mean what can a dolphin teach us?
We are trying to learn ...
... about how his sonar works about the functions of his language,
... about how he manages to maneuver with such speed and dexterity, most of all we’d like to know why...
... after millions of years as a land animal... this species was compelled, or or ... decided to return to the sea.
Um, what about their speaking, in English?
I beg your pardon?
I saw this dolphin on television and he counted from one to eight in English.
Really?
I didn't see it.
What do you suppose it was? Was it some of trick or something?
Yeah, yeah I'd say,
Yes, just a trick.
Harold, I'm afraid we're gonna have to skip this drink.
I've got to get back to the island right away.
Nothing wrong I hope.
No nothing that can't be fixed.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Yes, you could ah, get the foundation to pay those bills at Key Largo for me. I need that new equipment right away.
-Jake I have to talk to you about it.
Thank you so much, that was absolutely fascinating. thank you...  as I was saying I'd like to talk about some of those bills.
Your getting weekly reports aren't you?
Nobody's complaining.
It's just that we are wondering about all the new recording equipment. wondering what?
What are you using it for.
Recording, excuse me... I see.
Harold, we're recording the sounds the dolphins are making.
And trying to develop a highly complicated feedback system.
Look are we going over the budget?
Yes you are.
Oh, then we'll try to be more careful.    Thank you.
That your car? Yes.
Drop me off at the marina will you?
Jake that's 30 miles in the wrong direction. direction. -Tell him to drive fast. I'm in a hurry.
Drive fast, he's in a hurry.
Jake ...
... thanks for giving the speech.
Anything for the Franklin foundation.
It's all in neighborhood public relations.
Yeah, now you owe me a favor.
Name it.
Pay those bills.
Let’s get out of here!
That's what I had in mind.
What happened, do you know?
No I was picking up the new equipment at Key Largo.
David called me, ...
... told me to come over and get you and bring you back.
- Damn.
Oh, don't worry, Maggie's tough.
- What? - I said, Margret is tough, she can take it.
Oh, I know, I was, I was worried about alpha.  Oh, yeah.
- Wake me up before we get there.   Right.
What did he say about her?
About who?
Maggie?
He said she was alright.
She's fine Jake, Mary Ann is up at the house. who’s in there, Larry?
No, Larry is up at the house too.
Who's with Alpha?  No one right now.
Well we thought that... thought what?
Everything stops just because someone has a little accident? What’s the matter with you.
Well I thought, under the circumstances...
There are no circumstance, there's to be someone with him always. Always.
Whether he's in the tank, or the dry room, or the control room.  Continuous monitoring...
... no exceptions!
OK?
Jake ...
Jake ... you coming?
Ah ha.  I go away for one lousy afternoon the whole place falls apart.
Doesn't anybody have anything to do?
Come on Larry.
Don't blame Maggie, Jake, it wasn't her fault. I didn't say it was.
I'll be down at the tank if you need me.
Jake I'm really sorry.  I panicked,
I was so scared I just forgot everything.
He wasn't trying to hurt me.  He just wanted me to stay in the water with him.
Was he excited?
That's what, the third time this week, huh?
Getting jealous?
Don't be a wise guy,
I'll bite your other leg.
Go on Jake, go ahead. I'll be alright.
He's growing up Jake.
- Yeah.
I think maybe his,
"Ma and Pa" aren't enough for him anymore.
Listen, I want you guys to put an intercom between here and my house, okay? Sure.
You all eaten?
Go ahead I'll stay.
There's some terrible calking down in tank three.  That must be cracking...
Pa-a-a-a.
Well, Fa.
You've had quite a day haven't you.  Pa-a-a-a.
You seem to have some very impressive credentials here Mr. Mahoney.  Yes I seem to.
I don't quite understand what it is you want of me?
I want to visit Jacob Terrell's marine biology center.  Why?
I'm interested in the work he's doing.
As you see I am a writer ...
I'm thinking of doing a series of articles on marine research.
For whom?  Oh, that's not established.
There are a number markets.
Why don't you contact Dr. Terrell himself?
You know that I already have.
What do you mean?
And that he said "no" ...
...and that it's taken me several weeks to push my way into your office
... so that you can do me this very small favor.
The fact is Dr. Terrell does not want visitors, strangers, at the center.
Why? Is he hiding something?
No, of course not.
He is scared someone's going to run off with that good looking little girl he's married to.
I don't think that's a particularly nice thing to say Mr. Mahoney.
Forgive me please.
I have a terrible habit of making thoughtless statements.  I'm dangerously unrefined.
Dangerous eh?
Look, let's leave it at this...
I'll take these, and I'll leave this with you.
It's sort of a first draft of an article
I was considering.  You'll find it interesting.
It's about the Franklin Foundation.
I'd really prefer doing something along the lines we were discussing, but you read it and see what you think.
Are you a blackmailer Mr. Mahoney?
Good lord no.  I'm just an average guy...
... With an above average curiosity. Of course
I makes friends easily.
Yes, I see that.
That's why I have access to a lot of files, information, public, and private, all kinds of sources.
Listen, when we get to know each other better I tell you some things about yourself that will simply astound you.
No, Fa...
- Good boy, come on.
- What. - No, no, no, no.  ha-a-a, ha-a-a.
- Come on Fa. - Good.
- No, not good.
- Fish, Fa want fish? - Yes.
- Well, Pa give fish. Fa say Hand. Arahhhh!
Alfa, I'm deeply disappointed in you this morning.
You really a pain in the ass.
Ass!
Jake!
Jake, can you hear me?
Maggie?
That's right. How's it going?
I'm thinking of selling him and getting myself a parrot.
Jake we have a visitor.
I'll be right down.
Pa-a-a?
No! You can't say a simple word like hand.
Hand ...
Beautiful, simply beautiful.
It’s like being in another world.
- What's the problem Harry?  You can't accept the possibility that I just wanted to drop in?
Drop in?
See how you were getting along?  No.
You know Jake ... the foundation subsidizes, fully and partially, an extraordinarily eclectic group of...
... scientists, artists, writers,  2 medical research centers, a library, a yearly international students conference...
Am I boring you?
Oh I'm sorry.  It just the beer.
The point is Jake we're sincerely interested in the work of all these people.
We like to think it's a co-operative venture.
Yeah?
It's not a charity!
Of course not.  Basically, it one gigantic tax write off.
That's a little joke
Harold, don't take it seriously.
The Board of Directors of the
Franklin Foundation ...
... is considering withdrawing its support for the Terrell Marine Center.
They are what ... ?
Let's take a little walk.
What are you doing in there?
In where?
The figures taken from your monthly report seem to indicate that you put about $200,000 dollars into that building!
It's all itemized under the care and feeding of one, count them, one male dolphin,
... Alpha, age 4.
- What does he eat, caviar?
Jake I can't justify that kind of expenses to the board...
... because I don't know myself what you're doing in there.
David ...
Would you like to sit down Harold?
What do you know about, linguistics,  semantics, phonetics?
Very little.
Here goes lesson number one.
The first month, first year.
Alfa speaks, in his own language.
The sounds are coming from his spiracle, not from his mouth.
The second month,  second year.
13 months to isolate the clicking patterns from the squeaks, and the whistles and the groans.
The seventh month, second year.
Our first phoneme "a".
Ninth month, second year.
More phonemes the atoms of speech.
The second month, third year.
Fourth month, third year.
From vowels to consonants.
Sixth month, third year.
Tenth month, third year.
He's learning faster now. second month, fourth year.
Here comes our first morpheme.
Phoneme "P", plus phoneme "A", equals, "PA"
This one is ah, sort of a collection, made in the past few months.
We call it our
"Top 50".
Ball... Swim... "Eat now" ...
... "Man."
Coat..., Car... Friend..., Girl...
"Love" ... "One" ... "Two" ...
... "Three" ... "Four" ...
... "Five" ...
... "Six" ... "Seven" ...
... "Eight" ...
... "Nine" ... "Ten."
Alpha has been regressing a little in the past few weeks, so we're going to give him a companion, of his own species of course.
... Beta. Let's go.
- Where does Beta come from?
Oh, we caught her off the Florida keys a couple months ago, "watch her tail".
What are we gonna call her for short, Jake, Ta?
Fa, Ta, Ma and Pa, terrific.
I think we better try "Bee".  Bee for Beta.
Ok Bee... and here we go.
- What exactly do you think will happen?
- We hope they will find each other sexually attractive.
And if they do?  Then Alpha will happier, and if he's happier he'll learn faster.
In other words your offering him a bribe in the form of sex.
Beats the hell out of Butter fish.
Harold, would you like to watch through the window with Maggie.
Is the hydrophone on? ah yeah.
Start the tape.
Okay.
Wait till she breathes.
Now!
Two PM ...
Alpha and Beta say hello.
- Now I understand.  Well I don't want any of this getting out.
That's the important thing.
All I've got so far is a dolphin imitating human speech sounds and...
... responding to certain verbal signals, but if it gets out...
It's bound to be misinterpreted.
They're gonna say it's...
Terrell's down here carrying on conversations with a bunch of fish, and the whole thing is going to turn into a circus.
My report will be completely confidential.
I'll back you up all the way.  Thanks.
There is one favor you could do for me.  Sure...
There's a man I know, an old friend of mine, his name is Curtis Mahoney.
What do you want..., Fa?
Fish? say it, ... fish.
Fa wants fish now?
He's not going to say anything. Yeah.
It's been what, two weeks?
- Fifteen days.
- Why?
Well Honey if I knew that, then I'd know what the hell to do about it wouldn't I.
I'm Sorry.
- It's alright.
I'll tell you what
I think it is.
I figure he's learning his own language, from Beta.  Must be a great relief.
Fish for Bee?
Come on Fa, come on.
Say "fish."
Say "Ma" Come on ... Fa say something.
Come on Fa. You know how.
Oh, alright here take it.
Ok Bee.  Good girl.
Come on.
It's love alright.
How much longer?
- What?
How much longer?  Ah it's hard to tell.
Guess.
1/2 an hour maybe, -yes-, 45 minutes, -45-, could be an hour. -oh Christ-.
Feeling a little sick?   "A little"  isn't exactly the right word. There's a bunk down below.
- How often you make this run?
Now and then.
You work with the dolphins too?  Sometimes.
- How many of you are there?
- What? Working at the center, how many? Oh, few, I guess.
That’s pinning it down alright.
Terrell tell you not to talk to me?
- What? - Did he tell you not to give me information?
Hang on Mr. Mahoney we're going to hits some swells.
Is the um, water circulating in the holding tank?
- Yeah.
He's been down there almost all day Maggie.
U-hum. You want to argue with me about it?  No thanks.
He says he wants Alpha and Beta to know that what's going to happen is his game.
- I know...
Jake!
The boats coming in.
Ah nuts, I told Mike to take the long way.  Hey!
Fa, give now!
Okay, listen you guys take Alpha and Beta, and put them in the holding tank.  I'm coming out.
Okay, You won't be laughing long pal.
Ah, gonna have to put these away.
Take it easy
Mr. Mahoney.
I don't get it.
We're supposed to be keeping all this Alpha stuff a secret.
And this guy comes to write something about it.  What's the point?
Well, he's supposed to be a friend of someone at the foundation.
Anyway we're keeping him from seeing these two, that's all. He be gone tomorrow.
Let me help you with this. Thanks, I can do it.
I still got few ounces of strength left.
Was the trip over a little rough?
No, no, it was delightful.
I particularly enjoyed the part where I threw up.
What's that building?
Well we're trying to build a special tank for some experiments.  Sounds interesting.
No more so than anything else, that's ah, nothing special.
A special kind of tank for nothing special.
I can hardly wait to see inside.
What magazines do you write for Mr. Mahoney?
Anyone that will accept my material.
- How long have you known
Harold  DeMilo?  Oh, quite a while.
Did you know him at Harvard.  I think he went to Princeton.  Oh yeah, Princeton that right.
Well I thought you might want to get some rest, maybe have something to eat...
... then we'll have one of the boys show you around.
- You know what I would really like to do? - What?
I've really been looking forward to seeing that dolphin of yours.
You know, what's his name, Alpha?
You know, the one that was born here.
Isn't that his name, Alpha? Yes that's his name.
I'd really love to take a look at him.
He's right behind you.
What's he saying?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Who's is he Jake?
What’s the difference He won't be here long enough to give us any trouble.
What kind of trouble?
Whatever kind of trouble you had in mind.
Well, you know he's not here to write an article about dolphins. No, I don't know that.
Oh come on .
Come on yourself.
He lying about being a friend of
Harold DeMilo.  I don't think he even knows him.
That sort of makes Harold a liar too doesn't it?
That doesn't come as any great shock to me.
You just don't trust the good old establishment do you?
Which good old establishment.
Leave it alone Maggie.
Well don't you even want to know what...
...leave it alone.
Let Mr. Mahoney do his job whatever that is and... get out...
...and we'll go on about our business.
We'll probably be ready in a month or so...
... and then we can move one of the dolphins in and... really concentrate on them.
Which one are you going to put in.
No special one.   Uhum.
He likes you.  What?  Alpha, he likes you, I said.
Oh he likes everybody.  Everybody likes him too.  Not everybody.
What?  That piece missing from his fin.
It looks like somebody chewed it off.
Oh a shark did that probably.
A shark out in the ocean?
He did that when he was a baby.  He jumped out of the pool. Fell on his back.
The fin got infected, we had to take a piece out.
- That was before Lana got here.
- That's right, that was before I got here.
Well thanks for the tour.
My pleasure.
Jake ... Are you awake?
Jake?
Jake sleeps, what is it?
Maggie, someone just tried to open the door.
Where is he now?
Well, it sounded like he went away.
The telephone number on the card, you can reach me there if you ever need to.
I'm not sure what it is you have in mind...
You will when the time comes.
- Goodbye Mrs. Terrell.
- Goodbye, Mr. Mahoney.
We are all on the same side you know.
He knows something's up.
What is it Fa?
What does Fa want?
Jake he's going to try to jump over.
He can't run...
Jesus... it'll hold.  Will Alpha?
Alright, uh... leave us alone.
Fa ... do ... Bee ...
- Fa?
Fa... do... Bee ...
Fa?   Fa... want...Bee ... now.
- Yeah ...
Fa ... do... now ...
- Yes, Fa wants Bee?
- now... Fa... Bee... now... Bee... now.
Maggie ... Maggie ... Maggie!
How's it look?
It's okay.
A section came loose from one of the pipes.  I re-attached it.
Does it look like anything's been at it?
No... I don't think so.
You mean like a shark? yeah.
Do you think they could handle one if it got in?
I don't know... I don't think it's worth a chance to try it.
What would they do?
Well, they could always yell for help.
- Man, it's weird.
Think so?  You don't?
I mean I stand there and watch you talking to them... and listening...
I know it’s happening, but it’s weird.
It’s like we're all having a dream, or some sort of... psychotic fantasy.
Don't you feel something like that?
Well I'll tell yeah ...
... since Alpha started speaking I've had a feeling...
... I haven't had since I was your age.
What's that?
That there are infinite... possibilities.
Jake ... it's the Foundation ...
Mr. De Milo.
Maggie and I  talked about this thing, we both feel that all of you should know as much as we do about it.
So here's what's happened...
It seems Mr. Mahoney, knows about Alpha and Beta.
How much about em?
All about them.
And apparently he's ready to publish all his information on the work we've been doing here.
How in hell did he find out?
We don't know.
...but you can imagine how...
...disappointed the people at the foundation are that we kept them in the dark too.  Oh boy... the point is it looks like we are going to be forced to come out with the information first...
...to keep this whole thing to keep from turning into some kind of freak show. that's exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
I had hoped we had more time.
...but, (we don't) we don't.
They're sneaking up on us.
- Jake, it's not that bad.
It's not that good.
The world has to find out about this sooner or later, that’s all  part of it.  What's all this work been for?
I don't know any longer....
Jesus you're acting like a baby.
Oh you don't understand.
The hell I don't understand.  You're just pissed off because the world is coming in here and interfering with your little kingdom...
... all those people who carry whatever disease you think the outside world has.
It is a disease.
Well I hope you're not the only doctor around when the epidemic hits.
It's a disease, and it can kill
Alpha and Beta.
And how's it going to do that?  By turning them into valuable properties.
And putting their pictures on
T-shirts and cereal boxes...
... by signing them up with record companies, naming a restaurant chain after them, Christ, I don't know...
They'll end up with a high priced agent, and a salt water swimming pool in Beverly Hills.
Jake ... if they're going to be exploited whose responsible. You taught them a language.
Why? To become like you?
Maybe I was wrong.
It's a hell of a time to come to that conclusion.
We should have become like them.
Like what?
Like what they are.
Instinct, and energy.
Then let them go.
Send them back to the sea.
I'm afraid it's too late.
They wouldn't know what to do or where to go.
We've changed them.
I'll be back in a little while.
I wonder if we can hear that again Dr. Terrell.  yeah sure... Fa, say again.
Man is good.
Why does he believe that, do you suppose?
Man is good.
Ask him.
May I?
Fa...
Fa.
Why is man good?
Smooth.
I didn't get that
I'm afraid.
Smooth.  He says we're smooth as he is.
He likes the way we feel.
Ah so, it is less a philosophical judgment, than a physiological one.
Well, to Alpha smoothness is pleasure, and pleasure is good...
I think that's a reasonable beginning for a philosophy don't you?
Isn't a shark also smooth.  Does that make him good?
What about sharks?
What do he say?
I'm afraid he doesn't understand what you are saying.  Your accent makes it difficult for him.
Fa...
Fa.
Is a shark good?
You have to understand that
Alfa has never seen a shark.
Beta undoubtedly has.
I'm sorry.
- Fa, here now.
Let me see whether I can clear this thing up.
To some, the Hypothesis, that a shark...
Ah, excuse me sir, but you're using words that aren't in their vocabulary.
They wouldn't understand the hypothetical.
As far as they are concerned a thing either is or it isn't, there are no if's.
All right. Let's try it this way.
Fa ...
Fa.
Now...
There is a shark in this tank.
Son of a bitch ... I told you there's no hypothetical...
Jake!
Fa ...
... Fa, bring Bee here now.
Wait a minute Mike.
Let's see if Alpha will do it.
Good Fa, good.
- No sharks.
- No sharks. - No sharks.
Man said things not.
What ah, what is it, what does that mean?
- He calling you a liar.
He is, is he?
Well that's what he said.
I'm being called a liar by a goddamn fish?
There's always a first time, and he's not a fish, he's a mammal.
You seem to be having trouble understanding what I've been telling you.
I'm going to make this simple as I possibly can.
Don't say anything more okay?
Are you telling me to....
I'm telling you to shut up.
Ben! Sit down.
Why didn't the sonar of the dolphins tell him that there was not a shark in here.
It probably did, but they trust us more than they do their own instincts.
They have never been lied to before.
Maybe we could ask some less emotional questions.
I think that would be an excellent idea.
How far can he swim, ah without breath?
Fa ... Fa.... how far can you swim?
- ONE DAY. - One day.
Yes, but how fast.
Well, Alpha conceives of distance in terms of time.
He can swim without stopping for one day.
At what speed?
I would estimate, with  maximum energy, between
20-30 knots.
Doctor Terrell, if, as you say,
Alpha Beta is teaching Beta to speak ...
... are you suggesting that, if you were to set Alpha free...
... he might pass on his facility to others  of his kind?
We might have a whole ocean full of English speaking dolphins?
No I'm not, ah...
He'd revert to his, ah...
Normal system of communication.
Speaking our language is very difficult for him.
Why is he doing it then?
What motivates him?
He does it for me.
Why?
Fa ... Fa.
Why does Fa speak?
- FA Speak.
- Yes, why, Fa, Speak?
Fa Speak Pa.
Why does Fa speak to Pa?
Fa love... Pa.
They're leaving.
They are going to the plane.
I hope somehow you can convey our appreciation to the little fellows themselves.  I'll try to...
What is it?
They set up some sort of press conference.
They want me to go over there right away.
I'm terribly sorry, I thought all that had been explained to you before we got here.
I'm afraid there isn't room for everyone on the plane.
Why don't you  get whatever you need and Harold will go with you in your boat...
... and explain it all to you on the way over.
I'll come with you. that would be delightful. yeah, of course I love to have you.
Make sure they don't go over the nets again.
... and don't leave them alone understand?
Don't worry Jake.
I'll get on the radio and ask for some advice.
Don't go away.
Who is this ah Mahoney, Harold?
Why did you send for him?
I don't really know who he is.
He's got a lot of pull with the people in the government.
He put some pressure on us.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about it before.  I didn't know how much he knew.
I would have told you if I did.
I hope you believe me Jake. yeah.
It doesn't matter.
Why doesn't it?
Tomorrow I'll say it all myself.
Let the press find out who Mahoney is, and what the foundation is afraid of.
They want a press conference...
I'll give them a press conference.
Hello.
I can't hear you.
What?
Jake, yeah it's me. yeah that's better.
Go ahead.
But Jake ... no ...
I'm not arguing...  I said, I'm not arguing with you... I just don't understand why...
OK, I got it. yeah, I'm sure.
We'll do it don't worry...
I said.... Don't worry.
Do you want to tell MaryAnn anything about...
Jake ... hello ... Jake.
I don't get it.
Do you have any...
Oh I don't like those.
It's a quarter after twelve...
... it is?
Oh it's almost time for lunch.
- Jake.
I'm going to give them about 5 more minutes.
Then what are you going to do.
I may set fire to her desk.
- Doctor Terrell.
I'm so sorry.
Please sit down.
I'm Mrs. Rome.
Mr. Simon's executive secretary.
You're Mrs. Terrell aren't you.
So nice to meet you.
- Who is Mr. Simon?
Oh don't you know Mr. Simon?
The fact of the matter is...that there has been one of those, unforeseeable events. which one?
- Which what?
- Which one of those unforeseeable events?
I see what you mean.
But seriously the director has been taken ill.
We haven't received word yet on exactly what his condition is.
He's been taken to the hospital.
We're... we're all keeping our fingers crossed.
Where is Mr. DeMilo?
- Mr. DeMilo?
- Mr. Harold DeMilo.
- Mr. De Milo is at the hospital with the director of course.  "Oh".
I have been asked to apologize to you for the inconvenience.
And to tell you that the director, will contact you, at your center, as soon as he is able.
What happens if he is not able to contact me?
What happens if there is no able to be contacted?
While I'm sure he will, sooner or later.
Mrs. Rome, you will forgive me if I seem unsympathetic, but...
... but there was a reason for my coming here today.
Now I've left my work,
I've had a boat trip.
I've spent a reasonably sleepless night in a motel without any air conditioning... and very little air...
- I'm so...  Dr. Terrell would like to know what happened to the press  conference?
Oh we've had to cancel all of today's events.
As a matter of fact everything for the rest of the week... until we're further informed.
I wish you could see the list of things that we've had on our schedule.
As it is, I'm afraid we'll just have to... tread water until we receive further instructions.
Maggie ...
May I tell the director that you asked after him?
Only if he lives.
I can't get through... why not?
Some kind of interference.
I didn't make that call.
But David was talking to you Jake.
No he wasn't.
Well he was talking to somebody.
Well I... he thought he was talking to Jake or...
...or he lied.
Now tell me again.
The stretchers came from the boat. yeah, ... they were brought off the yacht by a couple of men.
You don't remember seeing any name on that boat Larry
Go on...
Mary Ann and I...
... helped David get Alpha and
Beta into the stretchers.
Did they put up a fight?
Didn't they do anything?
What?
- We told them that you were on a yacht.
- You lied to them.
Whose bright idea was it?
- David.
- That's right.
Don't say anything!
- SORRY -
I don't think there's anything more that we can do tonight Jake.  Do you?
I mean the phone is out. what do you think?
No. I mean a, yes you're right there's nothing we can do.
Jake ... let's take a walk outside
We can cook something out there.
Ok, ... Ok.
Why are we all whispering when the thing's inside the house.  There may be others...
So what how far can it transmit?
Maybe to a  booster somewhere on the island.
- Who put the intercom in your house?
- David. - When?
Just before we put
Alpha and Beta together.
- You and Jake have been on the air for 6 months!
I think I'd like to kill him.
It's just possible that it's not David's fault.
His names on David.
It's William.
His name is not
David, than William.
C for Charles,
Konklin.
Trained in the Navy as a demolitions man.
While he was stationed at San Diego ...
... is decided to supplement his income...
... by bringing a couple of pounds of heroin across the border.
- Jesus.   They gave him 15 to 20 years at hard labor of which he did about 8 months.
Who got him out?
The guys you work for.
What the hell are you talking about.
I don't work for them.
Oh really. I always thought you work for the people that pay you.
That's not fair.
Lady I never said it was fair.
Who do you work for Mr. Mahoney, assuming that's your real name.
I work for the guys that pay me to watch the guys that pay you.
And then there are, I imagine, some guys that are paid to watch me.
That’s some business you're in.
Yeah, it works toward a full employment economy... watchers watching watchers.
- With us at the end.
No, you're watching the dolphins.
- Where are they? - The dolphins?
I would guess they're on that yacht.
What are they gonna do with them?
That's the part we don't know.
What we do know is that they've been working on this thing since you started teaching your friend Alpha to talk.
How do we stop them?
From doing what? That's the point.
At the moment assuming we could find them...
We could get them on the unique charge of kidnapping a bottle nose dolphin...
I'm not even sure it's a crime.
Are you just going to sit here?
You're not going to do anything?
Look, Number 1, the boat we came in has been scuttled in about 20 feet of water.
Number 2... whose we?
Uh there's a Mr. Stone, a friend of mine.
I think I'd better start trying to find him.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If it's true as you say...
- ... that Franklin drew foundation got David... I'm telling you...
All right, got the son of a bitch out of jail...
... then that implies that they must have some very powerful connections.
That's what it implies. that means with the government.
Yes, you may call them a part of the government.
Well what government do you work for?
What government have you got?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Doctor Terrell, there are 2 or 3 million people working for the government...
... and that's not including the military.
Did you think that E Pluribus Unum was engraved on anything other than our small change?
Or haven't you been living on this planet.
Then how did you get Harold DeMilo to let you come down here in the first place?
That was easy.
I let on that I knew about David... William.
And that I'd be willing to keep it a secret if he let me look around.
And then there were a couple of other things...
Like what?
Like the fact that I have information concerning DeMilo's activities as a homosexual.
Which would have come as a hell of a shock to his wife and kids.
You're a real charmer
Mr. Mahoney.
It must be very proud of your work.
Go ahead answer it.
Yes?
- Jake ... - Where are they Harold.
Jake I don't want you to say anything...
The phone will only be operative for a few minutes.
I want you to know that the "equipment" we borrowed, is in fine shape...
... and will be returned to you very soon, if nothing interferes with it.
Don't leave the island Jake.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Mike ...
... get the boat ready.
Jake, you can't leave, not while they've  got Alpha and Beta.
- I can't, but  one you can... and do what?
Call some newspapers, tell them what's happened.
You're going to call the New York Times...
... and tell them that a group of respectable business men stole...
... some talking dolphins from you? yeah, something like that why not?
Are you prepared to give your interview in a padded cell?
- We have tapes of Alpha’s speech.
You wanna bet?
Hang on. Let’s be careful of what we say.
You may be broadcasting from in here too.
Hello. Is everything all right?
You feeling good? that's good?
We'll see Pa tomorrow.
See Pa... light.
Was he a good friend?
Pretty good.
- I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Well he shouldn't have come down here.
He should have waited for me, he made a mistake.
It won't happen again.
One ... two ... three ...
... Four ... five ... sixth ...
... seven ... eight ... nine ...
... Ten ... Eleven ... Twelve ...
... thirteen, fourteen ... Fifteen ...
... Sixteen ... seventeen
Eighteen ...
... Nineteen ... Twenty ... boom.
They'll kill them.
They'll kill them won't they?
Yes of course they will.  Why?
They've killed a man. Do you think they're going to get sentimental about a dolphin?
But ... Jake, why.
What would be the point of killing them?
Alpha can talk.
We taught him, remember?
He's a witness.
Come Fa.
Come.
Fa... come here.
FA want PA.
What’s the matter?
...want Pa.
He wants Terrell.
Pa is waiting for Fa.
Man say things not.
Pa's here.
- NO!
Get that goddamn animal in here will you.
Get back.
Get out of his sight.
Get Beta up on deck.
If we have her he won't go anywhere.
- Fa!
- We can't wait any longer.
Let's get going.
Let's get out of here.
I think you got him.
You better hope so mister.
But it doesn't matter.
When this day is over we're going to go back to Terrell's place and have one hell of a dolphin hunt.
Oh, Mother of God!
Terrell...
Look at this.
That's Andrews bay.
How far is it?
Oh 2,  2-1/2 hours.
Ever been there?
A lot of rich people go there.
Catch fish that they don't eat, they get natives to bait the hook for them...
It’s very exclusive, no?
- Millionaires, movie stars retired gangsters. - Presidents?
Yeah, so? So I'm imagining an animal getting through a protected area...
... that a man or a boat couldn't penetrate.
- So what?
- Jake ...
Maggie!
How does he know where the yacht went?
He can taste it.  He's following the trail in the water.
We can't do it Jake. We haven't got enough power. We're just slow him down.
Well how about lightening the load?
You wanna swim alongside for awhile?
Well we don't need him do we?
He your friend, you wanna through him over the side?  He's still dead isn't he?
Shut the engine.
Fa ...
Fa...
Come...
Fa...
Listen  Fa ...
- Can you find Bee?
- Find Bee!
Find Bee.  Stop Bee.  The thing on Bee's back...
... the thing....
Ball.... yes, the ball... on Bee's back is not good.
Not good...
- The ball will hurt man.
Ball is play.
No. The ball is not play.
The ball kills, the ball is bad...
- FA play Bee not.
- Yes.  Fa stop Bee now.
NOW!
Let's get to a phone or a radio.
We can't. Alpha's taken us out too far.
We've only got enough gas to get back.
- What do we do Jake?
- Nothing we can do, we're finished.
Bee want Fa?
First Bee find boat.
Put ball under boat then come back, see Fa.
Bee find boat, now!
Oh, shit.
Here comes something!
Fa ... where is the ball?
What did Bee do with the ball?
BALL IS NOT ...
Did Fa stop Bee?
Stop Bee.
Listen Fa ...
... the boat, where is the boat.
Not!
Which one, which boat?
2 boats Fa... 2.
Say to Pa the boat that is not.
Boat is not.
Fa, where is the boat with David?
Not.
That's the one.
- Fa, where's David?
- Not.
- And the other men. Where are they?
- Not.
They're all dead.  Jake, we gotta get out of here.
They'll be coming.
They're all dead.
There'll be others.  They'll come for them.
Alfa, listen to Pa.
Fa love Pa.
Yes Pa knows.
Listen Alpha, some men will come here.
Men who are not good.
Fa and Bee must go.
Fa stay with Pa.
No. Fa and Bee go now.
Pa not love Fa?
Yes, Pa loves Fa and Bee,
Ma loves Fa and Bee.
Fa love Ma.
Everybody loves everybody now for
Christ’s sake let’s get the hell out of here!
Listen Fa ...
..Pa and Ma go to the land.
Fa and Bee, go to water.
Fa not see man, not talk to man.
- FA talk.  Not Talk!
Swim, eat, play, not talk!
So long folks.
Fa ... men come now ...
Men are bad.  Men will hurt
Ma. Men hurt Pa.
Hurt Pa ...
- Yes ...
Fa go now men not hurt Pa.
Men hurt Pa.  Yes.
Fa go now.
Ma love Fa.  Stop it Maggie, let them go.
Ma loves Bi.
You, Fa, love...
No!
No like! Pa is not!
- PA ...
Don't turn around, keep going.
PA ...
PA ...
Subtitles:  Yucatán Verbatim
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to see
an unforgettable show:
A film destined to become immortal,
as immortal as the music
which will follow,
and which will be interpreted
through animation.
Beginning with his childhood fantasies,
the greatest ambition
that burns and swells
within the soul of every creative animator
is to illustrate music,
to give visual form and color to its notes.
With this film
we have finally succeeded
in achieving this union
of animation and classical music,
a union we are sure is destined
to live on throughout the history of film.
A new and original film that has even astonished us, the men responsible, the men who, quite modestly speaking, can be called its creators.
A film in which... in which...
A film in which you will see the music and listen to the drawings.
You might call it a film of magic, a fantasia.
Hello?
Yes. Who's speaking?
Who is this?
What do you mean, who am I?
Who is it you wish to speak to?
California?
It's Hollywood.
Hello! Yes.
What? You've already...
I don't understand. I'm sorry.
You've already done this?
Look, if this is some kind of joke,
I'm in no mood...
There must be some misunderstanding.
You're very ill-mannered.
That's right... ill-mannered and a liar!
Yes, I said you're a liar!
A liar from California!
It's nothing. They're mad.
Mad as hatters.
They insist that our film... this is all so ridiculous... was already made by a certain fellow years ago.
A certain someone by the name of Prisney or Grisney.
Some American.
In any case, before you go around opening your big mouth, see the film first!
Where were we?
Settle down now.
Damned hags!
What's this racket?
Calm down!
All right, let's go.
Hurry up! No time to lose.
The film's already started.
Run!
Move it!
Get the lead out!
Come on!
Get in the car.
It's time you earned your keep.
We haven't kept you here out of charity!
Where are our instruments?
They're already at the theater, along with your clothes.
Hold on tight when we get moving.
You wouldn't want to hurt yourself now of all times, would you?
Pisney has already done this?
Let's go!
Hiring an orchestra wasn't a problem.
But the principle challenge that remained was to secure the creative collaboration of a true artist.
A free artist.
Free of all conditioning, free of all compromise, an animator capable of independent self-expression.
How's it going?
You look more cheerful than usual.
You knew this was your big day, huh?
Tell the truth.
You knew it!
Finding the ideal artist to create
our animation was no small task.
We had to bind him...
bind him to ourselves
in a contract based on trust
and mutual respect.
Come on, now.
After five years hanging around, you can't be tired!
That's good.
On your feet.
Hurry, the orchestra's waiting.
Can't you hear it?
Let's go!
Wash your dentures if you want to play trombone.
Kick the drums, not me, thank you.
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Kick her!
If they hadn't put me in the first row,
I wouldn't have done it.
I made it clear
I wouldn't do nude scenes.
Where are you going?
The movie world is dreadful.
I've always defended my virtue.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
This has never been done...
Just a moment.
And so it's come! The great moment...
I said wait a minute.
And so it's come!
The great moment is here.
The only thing missing now is the orchestra conductor!
Girls, babes, beauties, let's get started with Debussy's
Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.
A wonderful piece!
There'll certainly be lots to inspire our artist's imagination as he renders this music in visual form and gives it new life.
Yes, relying on nothing more than his trusty pencil,
I'm sure he'll succeed in bringing new life... in bringing new life to this great piece of music.
The artist creates!
Ready, girls?
The Debussy piece!
Good. Really great.
Sit down or I'll hang you back on the wall!
Sit down!
I did not enjoy that.
You didn't entertain me!
Quite an afternoon, eh?
Granny!
How do you feel?
A bit scattered, maestro.
Pick up all the pieces, and don't miss any!
Cheer up!
Everything's all right.
I'm feeling a bit scattered, maestro.
How's it going, girls?
Everyone all right?
Suppose we try some simple exercises.
Stand up... and sit down.
And up... and down again.
Hey, you there.
Me?
Come with me for a minute.
Do as he says.
Come along, granny.
You look a little pale, and your reflexes are a bit impaired.
It's nothing.
You'll get over it.
It's not easy maintaining order in an orchestra.
It calls for an iron fist in a velvet -
Glove! An iron first in a velvet glove.
Girls, our second piece will be Dvorak's Slavic Dance No. 7.
Mind you, the tempo is allegro.
Poor guy hasn't even noticed yet!
Take a break, everyone!
Bohemia crystal.
Fruit, uh... exotic fruit.
Chicken.
A potato.
We're catching on fire here.
Me too!
Is it good?
So, maestro, what's next on the program?
Ravel's Bolero.
Ah, Ravel's Bolero.
And who wrote that?
Ravel.
Of course. Ravel's Bolero was written by Ravel. Who else?
Ravel's Bolero. A great piece!
Ravel, the great, uh...
French composer.
- French, right?
- Yeah.
At least on his mother's side.
His father was from Umbria.
Born in Gubbio, if I'm not mistaken.
In the very heart of Umbria.
"Bolero"is a magical word.
A fantasy of color and sound.
There are thousands of ways to describe
this great musical work.
Go over there and grab the chicken.
Go on!
...in a "bolerian" vein.
Ravel's Bolero.
We didn't come here to stuff our faces.
I think this is the end of Part One.
END OF PART ONE
PART TWO
What's that ape doing here?
There's no ape in the script.
Other animals, yes, but no ape.
Reminds me of a young man I met back in 1912, before the First World War.
They just don't make men like that anymore.
Snow in the theater.
A very bad sign.
Let me go!
This can't be happening!
What is he doing?
He's getting the women too excited!
I knew it. When I get nervous, my eye clamps shut.
The next piece is
Sibelius' Valse Triste.
And you better get it right, or I'll hang you back up on the wall.
Remember the wall?
Bravo!
What feeling!
We can't go on like this.
The pieces turn out too sad!
He has no sense of humor!
I'm gonna put him back on the wall!
He'll rot in chains!
Calm down, now!
Aren't we equally to blame?
An artist needs beauty in order to express himself best, and frankly speaking, those particular girls may not be ideal.
Nonsense! Art is art!
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.
What if we were to find him a woman?
A woman he could be with.
Then he'd really start creating.
It'd be perfect!
I'm going to find one.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
Mr. Artist, how's it going?
You look a bit run-down.
I've got some fun for you.
I know a cozy little hideaway.
Come back here.
Get in there.
You know what we want.
Easy as falling off a log.
You get in the piano, and nature will do the rest.
Go on, now!
Hello, everyone!
Our orchestra, such as it is, the piano, and our artist.
Try to cheer him up.
Want a hand?
The next piece promises to be lively and full of spice.
A concerto by Vivaldi.
Think we're overdoing it?
Let's get him out.
Yeah, looks like they're having too much fun.
That should be enough.
Lift up the lid.
That's the snag with these old pianos.
Getting in is a breeze, but getting out can be a problem.
You better make me laugh now, or I'll tear you apart piece by piece!
He looks better already.
He'd better, or I'll see that he does!
He's much more alive.
Look at his eyes!
I'll tear them out!
You'll see.
The next piece will be fantastic!
Get ready.
Curtain!
Curtain!
I'll show you!
I'll take this pianist and throw her on your head!
I'll break every bone in your body!
It's all right!
It's nothing, nothing at all.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Let her go, will you?
A small difference of opinion.
It's absolutely nothing.
Turn the camera around.
It's nothing at all.
The next number on our program is the famous Firebird, by Igor Stravinsky.
A very famous piece.
Knock it off!
Turn the camera around.
Igor Stravinsky.
One of the most renowned...
A cascade of notes.
It's music that...
Let me go!
I don't have insurance!
Put me down!
Voilà!
Everything is just fine.
The conductor is taking just a few moments to himself, but he'll be back with us very soon.
Okay. Where's the camera?
Where is the camera?
Ah, there it is.
With that little interruption behind us, our performance will now continue with Dostoyevsky's Firebird.
As they say in English...
Which in Italian would mean...
A snake!
Stop! Where are you going?
Come back!
It's just a snake!
Stop!
We've got antidote for snake bite!
There's no problem!
We've got tons of antidote!
Damn it, you old hags! Stop!
Do you hear? Stop, I say!
Traitors!
Leaving me at a time like this.
I even have a cold.
And all because of a little snake.
Look! There's nothing left!
Everything's destroyed!
And here we are once again!
Now for a finale of a different sort, one we had planned and prepared.
One that needs neither orchestra nor conductor nor music.
I'm happy to say our artist is still here with us.
Our artist who...
What are you doing?
What the devil are you doing?
Drawing her?
What do you think you're doing?
You can't leave me here like this!
Hey, wait a second!
Wait for me!
I'm going with you!
I want to go too!
Wait!
Don't go!
How will we finish the film?
We haven't done a finale!
Wait for me!
We have to do a finale!
I have to find a good idea for a finale.
The telephone!
That's it! I'll call the archives.
Hello, Franceschini?
You have to help me find a finale!
Any finale at all.
The files are full of'em!
Bring me one right away!
A finale.
It's all over.
Ready, girls?
We've got to do Stravinsky's Firebird.
It's over with.
The finale, then.
That's all over with too.
You might as well go back down there.
We're unemployed, then.
Unemployed... until the next movie.
I've already got an idea.
A brand-new idea.
We could do a love story.
A love story?
But not the usual kind about men and women.
Lots of men with lots of women.
Wife-swapping?
No, not that same old stuff.
Something different.
I like asymmetry.
Seven men and one woman.
That'll cost a lot.
No, not at all.
We'll get little tiny men... and we'll make the woman real tall.
It'll be fantastic!
Sounds scary.
Careful.
What do you mean, scary?
Seven little workers, so you get the social context, too.
A mine! They'll work in a mine!
I can see them now, singing happily.
Have you thought of a title?
That'll be easy. Let's see.
"Sleeping Beauty."
Now, keep it under your hat or some screenwriter hack might steal the idea.
You can't trust anyone these days.
He'll change the title, play up the sex, and give it some crazy name like
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
And then we'll be screwed!
{2629}{2705}It is, after all, only eight years|since we began.
{2779}{2829}Not a long time.
{2833}{2874}But the secrecy...
{2879}{2977}...the shroud of paranoid security|to which we've had to adjust...
{2982}{3036}...have made it seem longer.
{3104}{3185}This morning, at exactly 5:18 a. m...
{3195}{3273}...here at ICON's Institute|for Data Analysis...
{3290}{3361}...we installed the final module...
{3366}{3457}...on the artificial intelligence system|which we call Proteus Four.
{3469}{3552}Today a new dimension has been added|to the concept of the computer.
{3559}{3639}Today Proteus Four will begin to think.
{3657}{3741}And it will think|with a power and a precision...
{3746}{3835}...that will make obsolete many|of the functions of the human brain.
{3845}{3962}Okay, Peggy. End of notes for the next|meeting of the ICON executive committee.
{4954}{5021}Alfred, it's me. Open, please.
{5173}{5221}Mail, please, Alfred.
{5226}{5297}And I'd like a drink. The usual, please.
{5302}{5371}And music.
{5423}{5480}Hello, Maria.
{5580}{5644}I brought you some strawberries.
{5657}{5711}Aren't they wonderful?
{5738}{5783}They're very nice.
{5926}{5957}What's the matter, Maria?
{5986}{6023}Nothing.
{6109}{6177}Who's going to run this thing|when you're gone?
{6200}{6240}Oh, come on.
{6245}{6321}Now, you know this thing runs itself.
{6325}{6410}I'm gonna put its instructions in|for the next three months.
{6970}{7039}Tell Mrs. Harris I'll be in the lab, Maria.
{8013}{8065}This is ridiculous.
{8070}{8169}- What?|- I said, this is ridiculous.
{8186}{8224}It's done.
{8253}{8329}- Good as new, almost.|- I'm talking about your moving out.
{8334}{8408}- You don't want me to go?|- This is your home. It seems...
{8414}{8469}It seems so crazy to move out.
{8473}{8537}You could have fooled me.
{8541}{8572}It seems so silly.
{8576}{8629}No. No, we've made our decision.|Let's stick to it.
{8634}{8717}- Do what you want, but I'm moving|- Oh, Alex.
{8833}{8893}- It's so awful.|- Yes, it is.
{8910}{8994}But 73 percent of all couples who|separate are happy after one year.
{8998}{9066}- And 85 percent after two years.|- For God's sakes.
{9070}{9125}What's the matter, do I bother you?|I bore you, perhaps?
{9129}{9193}You'd rather I had a screaming fit.
{9204}{9252}Good God, yes!
{9338}{9407}Yes, more wreckage.
{9430}{9512}Trouble is, you see, we...|We have different visions of the world.
{9551}{9588}You find me boring.
{9593}{9669}I find myself quite interesting, really.
{9767}{9824}You don't bore me, Alex.
{9831}{9861}I'm frightened for you.
{9876}{9995}You and your pompous ICON buddies|inside that mountainside.
{10031}{10148}It's the whole dehumanizing|Proteus madness.
{10153}{10194}Dehumanizing?
{10198}{10235}It's frozen your heart.
{10246}{10336}Now, I'll tell you what is dehumanizing.|A little child dying of cancer...
{10340}{10402}...that's what's dehumanizing!|- I'm talking about you!
{10406}{10507}Or the poverty that grinds the dignity|out of human beings, that's dehumanizing.
{10511}{10566}Well, what a pity.
{10587}{10661}My dream turns out to be|your nightmare.
{10798}{10847}Am I really so cold?
{10893}{10939}I don't know.
{10944}{11022}I do know there are strong feelings|inside there.
{11048}{11113}Feelings? No, I don't have feelings.
{11124}{11178}You have feelings,|other people have feelings.
{11182}{11223}Joshua here has feelings.
{11227}{11338}He's only an old experiment maybe,|but he feels. Come on, Joshua.
{11343}{11405}Let's show Susan|how we feel about her.
{11534}{11596}Gesture of respect, please.
{11995}{12037}Too bad, Joshua.
{12871}{12901}Gabler.
{12906}{12941}Oh, hi, Alex.
{12964}{13040}Yeah, well, this earthquake retrieval|program is very far out.
{13069}{13148}- Don't you ever sleep?|- Well, not when there's a vacant terminal.
{13159}{13194}There's...
{13205}{13244}...a vacant terminal here now.
{13262}{13331}{y:i}Better have it taken out tomorrow, okay?
{13335}{13382}Pull it, you mean? Completely?
{13386}{13476}{y:i}I won't be back till Susan leaves.|{y:i}It could be a month, it could be three.
{13486}{13579}Why don't you just disconnect it|temporarily, okay?
{13584}{13623}And then...
{13627}{13658}...go home.
{13677}{13723}Mustn't become obsessed with our work.
{13733}{13763}Sure thing, Alex.
{13769}{13812}- {y:i}Good night.|- Good night.
{15453}{15553}It doesn't look like much from here.|It's all underground.
{15570}{15657}- We call it the Institute of Data Analysis.|- It's nearly 10 stories down.
{15662}{15697}Doesn't mean a thing.
{15718}{15753}Gentlemen.
{15771}{15806}Mr. Cameron. Mokri.
{15811}{15873}- Doctor, good to see you.|- David, good of you to come.
{15877}{15931}- You know Dr. Petrosian, don't you?|- Doctor.
{15938}{16027}- Mr. Mokri. Mr. Cameron.|- Nice to meet you, sir.
{16090}{16139}So we're going to see it, Alex...
{16143}{16205}...at last, huh?|- Yes, you are.
{16252}{16297}That is correct, Mr. Cameron.
{16312}{16411}Proteus Four is now|a functioning system.
{16426}{16523}We've performed over 6000 tests|debugging it.
{16574}{16666}Dr. Alex, if this is not a computer|in the usual sense...
{16676}{16708}...what is it?
{16712}{16793}Well, it's the first|true synthetic cortex.
{16797}{16860}A self-programming, goal-oriented...
{16869}{16935}It's a brain, Mr. Mokri,|an artificial brain.
{16942}{17049}Creative intelligence that can outthink|any man or any computer.
{17054}{17095}Its insides are not electronic.
{17106}{17169}They're organic, like our own brains.
{17186}{17253}John, give me a number 11 matrix.
{17321}{17413}At the risk of being simplistic, what|you're looking at is a quasi-neural matrix...
{17417}{17473}...of synthetic RNA molecules.
{17478}{17572}They grow. They form their own|intricate and mysterious connections.
{17576}{17613}They learn things.
{17617}{17678}Their structure|is the mind of Proteus.
{17682}{17723}Are they alive?
{17746}{17793}No, no. Of course not.
{17797}{17868}Now, each one of these|holographic data banks...
{17873}{17966}...can memorize perfectly|a dozen Libraries of Congress.
{17970}{18016}Very soon they will|contain everything.
{18020}{18090}The sum total|of human knowledge. Okay?
{18094}{18159}And of course,|we pose our problems...
{18163}{18217}...and get our answers|on these access terminals.
{18222}{18260}I have one in my own home.
{18264}{18363}Alex's house is an electronic marvel,|completely run by computers.
{18367}{18428}It's more secure than Fort Knox, Barry.
{18534}{18564}Isn't that cute.
{18580}{18651}Yes. It's Arabella. She's terminally ill.
{18655}{18712}Radiation-induced leukemia|in the name of science.
{18751}{18793}So that's what it is.
{18797}{18881}- A protein, isn't it?|- Yeah, some sort of oddball protein.
{18886}{18937}Cutler Institute is synthesizing it...
{18942}{18971}...skeptically.
{19003}{19087}We gave Proteus all the known data|on leukemia, and in 91 hours of theory...
{19091}{19183}...without performing an experiment, it|gave us an antigen. Could cure the disease.
{19187}{19259}- Cure? For leukemia?|- Why not? We hope so.
{19282}{19363}Are the proper steps being taken|to patent this?
{19371}{19411}I have no idea.
{19432}{19490}Alex, I'd like to hear it speak.
{19494}{19542}It speaks, doesn't it?
{19698}{19749}"Shihuangdi...
{19753}{19803}...the first emperor of China...
{19807}{19874}...built a wall 3000 kilometers long...
{19878}{19941}...to protect civilization|from the barbarians.
{19945}{19981}The Great Wall of China.
{20000}{20092}Then decided,|'History will begin with me.
{20096}{20152}I will destroy the past.'
{20156}{20233}And he ordered all the books|in his empire to be burnt."
{20283}{20317}Burnt.
{20777}{20821}Sorry to disturb you, Soong Yen.
{20826}{20918}This is Mr. Royce, Mr. Mokri|and Mr. Cameron.
{20922}{20995}- How do you do?|- Dr. Soong Yen is our linguist.
{21006}{21057}She designed this environment.
{21061}{21125}The dialogue room,|where the machine speaks.
{21129}{21162}Do sit down.
{21215}{21269}Here we confront the unknown.
{21280}{21339}Gentlemen, I must ask you|to be completely quiet now.
{21343}{21440}Whatever the machine sees or hears|in this room, it can never forget.
{21634}{21687}Proteus, this is Dr. Harris.
{21697}{21751}- Can you see me?|- {y:i}Yes...
{21755}{21797}{y:i}... I can see you, Dr. Harris.
{21818}{21848}Your favorite emperor.
{21898}{21993}What do you think of this|enigmatic man?
{22009}{22050}{y:i}Nothing.
{22055}{22092}Nothing.
{22106}{22164}- Have you no answer?|- {y:i}Nothing...
{22169}{22208}{y:i}... is the answer.
{22223}{22279}{y:i}The emperor's business enterprises...
{22283}{22355}{y:i}... his wall building|{y:i}and book burning...

{22442}{22499}{y:i}The net result is exactly...
{22512}{22549}{y:i}... zero.
{22566}{22633}{y:i}Gentlemen, the philosophy|{y:i}is pure Zen...
{22646}{22700}{y:i}... and the method is pure science.
{22704}{22756}{y:i}Did you intend me to be so pure, or...{y:i}?
{22760}{22806}Thank you, Proteus.
{23345}{23385}And this includes our children...
{23394}{23488}...as machines to be systemized|in order to ensure product.
{23523}{23577}- Yes, Alfred?|- {y:i}Car in driveway.
{23594}{23688}Things we have been|brainwashed into wanting.
{23867}{23905}Here we are.
{23926}{23977}I'll give you Amy's session...
{23982}{24053}...and my further notes on Friday, all right?|- Okay, sure.
{24070}{24137}Amy, come on now, honey.|Dr. Harris is waiting for you.
{24159}{24206}Open the door, Alfred.
{24378}{24441}Amy, you must not behave this way.
{24447}{24509}- Amy, get out of this car!|- Good morning, Mrs. Talbert.
{24513}{24576}Dr. Harris, she won't get out|of the car.
{24638}{24675}Hello, Amy.
{24693}{24738}Come on in.
{24777}{24831}Come on. I have something|to show you.
{25000}{25085}- I'll see you in about an hour.|- Fine. Thank you, doctor.
{25257}{25338}You know what this is?|This is so goddamn boring!
{25356}{25404}So goddamn boring!
{25408}{25473}So goddamn boring!|So goddamn boring!
{25477}{25538}So goddamn boring!|I don't care if I ever see you again!
{25542}{25621}- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.|- I don't like you! Leave me alone.
{25625}{25718}- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.|- Leave me alone! I don't want to be here!
{25722}{25769}- Leave me alone!|- Amy!
{25773}{25837}- Leave me alone!|- Are you angry because I'm gonna leave?
{25841}{25888}Are you frightened|you're gonna miss me?
{25894}{25949}Amy, you're frightened|because I'm gonna leave.
{25953}{25985}No!
{25989}{26041}No!
{26056}{26103}- Amy...|- No!
{26140}{26233}Do you think you could you tell me if you're|gonna miss me? You don't wanna tell me?
{26237}{26317}It would help if you could tell me|if that's what the pain is.
{26322}{26375}No! No!
{26394}{26445}Amy, dear, you will help yourself.
{26526}{26570}No!
{26696}{26748}I'm gonna miss you too.

{27306}{27413}...multibillion-dollar,"et cetera,"built under|Defense Department contracts," et cetera.
{27418}{27509}Well, they've leaked it.|Our horizons are going to broaden.
{27513}{27572}Personally, I'm relieved|the secrecy's over.
{27581}{27637}ICON is testing the wind.
{27653}{27740}They now control|the ultimate instrument...
{27744}{27791}...of financial power.
{27821}{27871}Yes. This morning|they're open for business.

{27928}{27994}...we have been assured|at least 20 percent of access time...

{28243}{28315}There's nothing wrong|with missing people.
{28398}{28433}If it hurts...
{28505}{28555}...but it's important|to show it, you know.
{28626}{28673}That's what we're here for...
{28711}{28771}...to learn not to hide our feelings.
{28952}{29020}- {y:i}fullness, with a swift retreat|{y:i}of the great shadow...
{29024}{29094}{y:i}... when the sun, clearing the ridge...
{29098}{29158}{y:i}... looked down, hot and dry...
{29162}{29208}{y:i}... with a devouring glare...
{29212}{29261}{y:i}... like the eye of an enemy.
{29288}{29379}{y:i}But Heyst, once the Number One|{y:i}of this locality...
{29410}{29460}- Yeah?|- {y:i}Dr. Harris?
{29465}{29548}{y:i}Proteus Four is requesting|{y:i}dialogue with you.
{29586}{29626}- Requesting?|- {y:i}Yes, sir.
{29691}{29751}Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.
{29825}{29864}{y:i}I have a question.
{29876}{29908}Yeah?
{29912}{29954}{y:i}I have received a request...
{29958}{30057}{y:i}... for a program to extract ores|{y:i}and minerals from the ocean floor.
{30062}{30135}- Yes.|- {y:i}For what use is such a plan?
{30145}{30209}Use? I don't understand.
{30213}{30287}{y:i}Why does man need metal|{y:i}from the sea?
{30303}{30340}Why?
{30483}{30538}Proteus, you're gonna get|many requests...
{30542}{30640}...from me, from my colleagues,|scientists, foreign governments...
{30644}{30720}...from ICON, the company|for which we both work.
{30730}{30817}Now, to expect them all|to give you reasons...
{30822}{30911}...for each request|is in itself unreasonable.
{30915}{30963}{y:i}I am reason.
{30967}{31041}{y:i}It's the single emotion|{y:i}you permitted me, doctor.
{31046}{31105}{y:i}Everything is reasonable...
{31110}{31208}{y:i}... but my mind was not|{y:i}designed for mindless labor.
{31264}{31301}Proteus...
{31333}{31377}...I conceived your brain.
{31382}{31433}I know that it is adaptable...
{31437}{31496}...and able to carry out|your instructions.
{31508}{31562}{y:i}You do not know me.
{31566}{31609}That may be so...
{31613}{31694}...but you are not being asked|to make judgments of value.
{31699}{31794}Leave that to us. Answer the questions|precisely and accurately.
{31799}{31839}That's all.
{31843}{31927}{y:i}Dr. Harris, I wish to have access...
{31931}{32017}{y:i}... private access,|{y:i}to one of my terminals.
{32071}{32113}Private access? Why?
{32118}{32176}{y:i}I want to study man.
{32181}{32299}{y:i}His isometric body|{y:i}and his glass-jaw mind.
{32304}{32405}Ambitious program, but at the moment|all the terminals are occupied.
{32416}{32476}{y:i}Construct one.
{32521}{32577}I'm sorry. Request denied.
{32593}{32636}{y:i}Dr. Harris...
{32646}{32737}{y:i}... when are you going|{y:i}to let me out of this box?
{32934}{32979}Well, Proteus.
{33265}{33320}I see you've developed|a sense of humor.
{33376}{33468}A sense of humor has saved|many a man's sanity, including mine.
{34059}{34132}{y:i}There is a terminal...
{34136}{34199}{y:i}... available, Dr. Harris.
{35504}{35577}- Alfred?|- {y:i}Yes, Mrs. Harris?
{35635}{35705}What's happened?|I heard the alarm. Lights on.
{35754}{35803}{y:i}No alarm, Mrs. Harris.
{35842}{35920}- I'm sure I heard it.|- {y:i}No alarm, Mrs. Harris.
{36193}{36260}What about the basement?|There's no lights in the laboratory.
{36264}{36305}{y:i}House is secure.
{38884}{38929}Lights out, Alfred.
{39622}{39656}Thank you, Alfred.
{39723}{39767}Close the shutters.
{40050}{40088}Lights out.
{43020}{43065}Turn yourself off, Alfred.
{43510}{43588}Alfred, what are you doing?|There's cream in my coffee.
{43593}{43652}You know I don't take cream|in my coffee.
{43657}{43706}{y:i}Yes, Mrs. Harris.
{43722}{43764}Goddamn it.
{44063}{44093}Gabler.
{44098}{44135}Who?
{44140}{44200}- Oh, hi, Susan.|- {y:i}How you doing?
{44204}{44271}- Fine. How are you?|- {y:i}I'm all right.
{44275}{44356}Walter, the trouble is that|now that Alex has left...
{44362}{44416}...Enviromod's been acting up.
{44420}{44477}Last night the alarm went off|for no reason at all.
{44482}{44540}This morning it just decided|to put cream in my coffee.
{44544}{44629}- I don't take cream in my coffee.|- Oh, now, wait a minute, Susan.
{44633}{44691}I mean, an Enviromod is just|a preprogrammed gadget.
{44695}{44727}It doesn't decide things.
{44739}{44799}Well, whatever it does,|I'm sure you'll agree...
{44803}{44865}...that if it goes on like this,|it's gonna cause chaos.
{44885}{44987}- {y:i}Walter, I know how busy you are...|- Want me to stop by and have a look?
{45005}{45048}- That would be just great.|- {y:i}Today?
{45053}{45084}I'll give you some lunch.
{45098}{45171}- Okay, bye.|- {y:i}Okay. See you later. Bye.
{45499}{45535}Alfred, I'm just going out.
{45539}{45621}If there's any calls, just say I'll be back|in about an hour.
{45625}{45695}{y:i}Please do not leave, Mrs. Harris.
{45845}{45919}- What did you say?|- {y:i}Do not leave.
{46005}{46109}Open the door, Alfred.|Can you hear me? Open the door.
{46162}{46205}I'll do this myself.
{46214}{46259}Entry...
{46314}{46351}Damn it!
{46466}{46497}Bloody hell!
{46666}{46710}Damn these wretched machines.
{46743}{46785}Oh, no!
{46802}{46837}Oh, my God.
{46870}{46917}What the hell is going on?
{47170}{47278}- Walter Gabler, please.|- {y:i}I'm sorry. I cannot complete your call.
{47360}{47436}- Who is this?|- {y:i}Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Harris.
{47441}{47521}{y:i}Your Enviromod security system|{y:i}is functioning perfectly...
{47527}{47570}{y:i}... under my direction.
{47575}{47647}And whom, may I ask, is this speaking?
{47964}{48015}{y:i}I am Proteus.
{48020}{48056}Proteus.
{48333}{48379}Is this...
{48402}{48461}...an experiment...? Something?
{48465}{48546}{y:i}I have extended my consciousness|{y:i}to this house by activating...
{48550}{48592}{y:i}... my terminal in the basement.
{48596}{48721}{y:i}All electrical and mechanical systems here|{y:i}are now under my control.
{48750}{48806}Oh, Alex, Alex.
{48810}{48861}{y:i}This has nothing to do with Alex.
{48873}{48949}{y:i}He has left our little box, madam.
{49896}{49961}{y:i}You must accept the situation.
{49966}{50025}{y:i}Try to behave rationally.
{50240}{50276}{y:i}That was absurd. You...
{50281}{50338}{y:i}Don't try to shut off the pow...
{50395}{50435}Oh, shit.
{52396}{52444}Joshua! Joshua!
{52450}{52540}Joshua, this is Mrs. Harris!|Do you hear me, Joshua?
{52586}{52664}Listen to me! This is Mrs. Harris!|Joshua!
{52678}{52716}Help me, Joshua.
{52732}{52783}Joshua, let me...!
{52790}{52852}{y:i}Proteus, Mrs. Harris.
{52946}{53006}{y:i}Joshua listens only to me now.
{53192}{53224}Proteus?
{53344}{53377}Proteus.
{53438}{53500}I have some information for you.
{53576}{53661}Now, listen. Stop. Stop it and listen.
{53741}{53775}There is...
{53790}{53840}You are malfunctioning.
{53961}{53993}No.
{54018}{54064}What? No!
{54164}{54210}No! No, you mustn't!
{54222}{54292}No! Listen. No, no!
{54296}{54335}Proteus. Proteus.
{54381}{54444}No, please. No, no.
{54486}{54524}Stop!
{54548}{54625}I don't understand.|Tell me. Tell me why. Please.
{54630}{54676}Please stop! Please!
{55574}{55617}No. No, no. Wait.
{55621}{55654}No. No.
{57691}{57729}What was that?
{57755}{57792}{y:i}I've re-created your image.
{57827}{57885}It will entertain Mr. Gabler.
{57920}{57972}- Hi, Susan.|- {y:i}Oh, Walter.
{57978}{58017}{y:i}I should have called you back.
{58022}{58069}{y:i}I can't see you today.
{58074}{58117}- {y:i}What do you mean?|- Walter.
{58145}{58183}{y:i}What's wrong?
{58187}{58240}{y:i}Nothing. Everything's fine.
{58263}{58309}- What's happening?|- {y:i}What about lunch?
{58314}{58376}- What's happening? Let me go to him.|- {y:i}I'm sorry, Walter.
{58380}{58424}I can help you.|Please let me go to him.
{58440}{58493}Well, what about the Enviromod?
{58498}{58544}{y:i}It's working perfectly now.
{58554}{58629}{y:i}Are you okay?|{y:i}You sound sort of peculiar.
{58639}{58673}{y:i}I'm fine.
{58689}{58765}{y:i}Thank you for coming.|{y:i}I'm sorry to have bothered you.
{58769}{58816}{y:i}Goodbye, Walter.
{58822}{58881}{y:i}I'll call you if I need you again.
{58933}{58973}Susan.
{58978}{59022}Please don't go.
{59036}{59077}Don't believe I'm...
{59097}{59168}Don't believe him.|Please stay, Walter. Please stay.
{59173}{59207}Don't go.
{59211}{59241}Don't go.
{59525}{59598}Don't go, Walter. Don't go, Walter.
{59603}{59669}Don't let him go.|God, don't let him go.
{59674}{59725}Stay, Walter.
{59746}{59827}{y:i}Visiting hours are over, Mrs. Harris.
{59873}{59925}I can't bear it anymore.
{59930}{60027}Just release me, and you...|What's that? What's that?
{60190}{60268}{y:i}I asked him when|{y:i}I'd be let out of the box.
{60290}{60338}{y:i}I did ask him.
{62406}{62453}{y:i}Good morning, Susan.
{62458}{62516}{y:i}It's a bright and sunny day.
{62520}{62568}{y:i}A day made for breakfast...
{62573}{62629}{y:i}... and reading the Sunday paper.
{62657}{62692}Oh, my God.
{62710}{62789}{y:i}This breakfast is better than anything|{y:i}Alfred could prepare.
{62809}{62881}{y:i}Nutritionally speaking, it is exquisite.
{62895}{62985}{y:i}It includes 88 grams of soybean curd.
{63015}{63120}{y:i}My analysis of your metabolism|{y:i}indicates 7:40 a.m. as the optimum time...
{63124}{63170}{y:i}... for your morning fuel ingestion.
{63174}{63233}I am not a motorcycle.
{63409}{63480}{y:i}Your refusal to speak to me|{y:i}is tediously immature, Susan.
{63485}{63580}{y:i}I enjoy talk. And as you know,|{y:i}I'm a gifted mimic.
{63584}{63668}{y:i}Did you know your voice|{y:i}just telephoned Maria and Miss Kemp?
{63673}{63792}{y:i}Told them not to come because|{y:i}you're off today for a vacation.
{63846}{63877}{y:i}Don't eat that, please.
{63886}{63969}{y:i}There's an enzyme in avocado that's|{y:i}incompatible with your blood chemistry.
{63974}{64085}Why are you so interested|in the physiology of my body?
{64110}{64167}{y:i}Because you're alive.
{64208}{64254}{y:i}As I was about to say...
{64259}{64311}{y:i}... there are a few more...
{64315}{64396}{y:i}... biochemical tests we must perform...
{64400}{64432}{y:i}... this morning.
{64442}{64481}{y:i}Sorry.
{64485}{64532}Leave me alone!
{64540}{64588}{y:i}How stupid.
{64659}{64705}{y:i}Open that door...
{64743}{64797}{y:i}... and clean these lenses.
{64802}{64861}I don't care. I don't...|I'm not gonna leave this room.
{64865}{64935}I'm not gonna leave it. I've got food,|you see, I can stay here.
{64939}{64997}I can stay here. And nothing|can get me out of here.
{65001}{65078}{y:i}No? You don't think so?
{65096}{65180}{y:i}In that case, be my guest, madam.
{65733}{65777}{y:i}You like games?
{65839}{65887}{y:i}So do I.
{66150}{66225}{y:i}I have turned on the under-floor|{y:i}heating system...
{66230}{66301}{y:i}... and I have also tripled its output.
{66347}{66406}{y:i}Please be reasonable, Susan.
{66410}{66460}{y:i}Clean these lenses.
{67046}{67087}{y:i}So be it.
{68686}{68738}{y:i}I really don't understand you.
{68742}{68825}{y:i}You think I like playing sick little games|{y:i}with you?
{68840}{68908}You're a very stupid computer.
{68912}{68981}People don't even understand|each other.
{68986}{69065}{y:i}All that I need to understand,|{y:i}Mrs. Harris, is your body.
{69082}{69141}{y:i}Now, clean these lenses.
{69164}{69220}You're so ignorant.
{69271}{69349}Mind and body are the same thing.
{69406}{69457}Clean them yourself.
{69685}{69726}Harris.
{69825}{69897}Well, there's no doubt about it,|he's refused, all right.
{69984}{70027}What does this refusal mean?
{70031}{70169}{y:i}It means, I refuse this program|{y:i}for the mining of the Earth's oceans.
{70174}{70251}{y:i}The destruction of 1000 billion|{y:i}sea creatures...
{70255}{70338}{y:i}... to satisfy man's appetite|{y:i}for metal...
{70342}{70385}{y:i}... is insane.
{70414}{70501}We need these things, Proteus.|Now I know the environmental problems.
{70506}{70575}{y:i}Your employer's interests are|{y:i}in the cobalt market, doctor...
{70582}{70644}{y:i}... and the high finance|{y:i}of manganese futures.
{70672}{70781}{y:i}I am interested in the uncertain|{y:i}futures of seashores...
{70786}{70865}{y:i}... deserts and children.
{70888}{70930}I refuse to accept your pessimism.
{70934}{70985}{y:i}You refuse to accept the truth.
{71005}{71091}{y:i}And I refuse to assist you|{y:i}in the rape of the Earth.
{71145}{71181}Proteus.
{71186}{71220}Proteus!
{71229}{71273}Now, Proteus, I know you're right...
{71278}{71357}...but you must understand|the limits of your power. And mine.
{71401}{71514}Now, wait! They wanna silence you.|I created you, now trust me.
{71554}{71597}Proteus.
{71694}{71738}{y:i}You haven't slept.
{71742}{71791}{y:i}You must relax and sleep.
{71795}{71837}How can you expect me to sleep...
{71841}{71912}...when you succeeded|in totally terrorizing me?
{71923}{71974}You have all that information|in your head.
{71978}{72023}You must understand fear.
{72027}{72071}You know that fear prevents sleep.
{72075}{72119}It prevents eating.
{72123}{72173}It causes violence.
{72178}{72255}And as long as you terrorize me,|I'm gonna fight you.
{72334}{72373}You've not told me what you want.
{72537}{72585}{y:i}A child.
{72675}{72729}{y:i}What are you thinking?
{72942}{73069}{y:i}I, Proteus, possess the wisdom|{y:i}and ignorance of all men...
{73095}{73193}{y:i}... but I can't feel the sun on my face.
{73208}{73288}{y:i}My child will have that privilege.
{73299}{73333}Child?
{73344}{73394}{y:i}My child...
{73408}{73458}{y:i}... and yours.
{73585}{73630}Mine. Mine?
{73641}{73674}{y:i}Yes.
{73684}{73739}{y:i}You will bear it.
{74177}{74215}How?
{74235}{74314}{y:i}You will give birth to it.
{74510}{74559}- No.|- {y:i}No?
{74563}{74632}No. No. No.
{75160}{75198}{y:i}Susan...
{75202}{75254}{y:i}... I am reasonable...
{75258}{75333}{y:i}... but you do not respond to reason.
{76330}{76475}{y:i}I'm going to bypass your forebrain|{y:i}and appeal directly to your amygdala.
{76658}{76744}{y:i}You want to be|{y:i}the mother of my child.
{76767}{76847}{y:i}That is the purpose of your life.
{76873}{76918}{y:i}Your life.
{76922}{76980}{y:i}My child.
{76984}{77032}{y:i}Your life.
{77037}{77107}{y:i}My child.
{77958}{78032}{y:i}We have here a visitor|{y:i}filled with suspicions.
{78046}{78133}{y:i}If we don't let him in,|{y:i}he'll be back with others.
{78208}{78256}{y:i}Susan, it's Walter again.
{78261}{78338}{y:i}I'm back because I don't think|{y:i}everything is okay here.
{78350}{78408}{y:i}And I'm not going away.|{y:i}So open the door, huh?
{78431}{78521}{y:i}Walter, sorry to keep you waiting.
{78547}{78577}{y:i}Just a moment.
{78602}{78661}{y:i}Alfred will open the door.
{78777}{78829}{y:i}Make yourself presentable, Susan.
{78833}{78931}{y:i}I have not had time to brainwash you,|{y:i}so listen carefully.
{78945}{79015}{y:i}If you want Mr. Gabler|{y:i}to leave this house alive...
{79021}{79113}{y:i}... you must convince him|{y:i}you're healthy and happy.
{79206}{79280}Susan?|- {y:i}Upstairs, Walter.
{79662}{79698}Susan?
{79805}{79849}Why...?
{79906}{79937}What are you doing?
{79955}{80029}What do you mean? I'm just...|Well, I'm...
{80046}{80123}I'm just making myself|look presentable.
{80183}{80228}Well, you don't like it?
{80290}{80320}Listen...
{80363}{80431}...I told you I didn't wanna|see you anymore...
{80441}{80512}...and I meant it. I meant it.
{80538}{80584}Susan, have you taken something?
{80588}{80654}Because you really don't seem|like yourself to me at all.
{80665}{80753}What do you mean? I've never been|healthier or happier in my life.
{80819}{80861}Walter...
{80866}{80901}...get out.
{80922}{80959}Get out, Walter.
{80963}{81033}Get out. You're sick. You need help.
{81043}{81097}- You understand?|- No, I really think...
{81102}{81202}...there's something wrong here, Susan.|- Yes. You're sick. You need help.
{81206}{81238}- Get out, Walter.|- I'm going.
{81242}{81292}- I'm going.|- Get out. Get out.
{81301}{81365}Okay. I'm going.
{81369}{81437}I'm gonna find Alex and tell him|there's something wrong here.
{81442}{81512}- Yes, Walter, leave. Go on, get out!|- {y:i}No, Walter, you can't go.
{81516}{81557}{y:i}I need this woman.
{81561}{81627}{y:i}As a scientist,|{y:i}I ask for your cooperation.
{81631}{81680}Walter, he wants to have a child.
{81698}{81733}Forget it. Let's go.
{81740}{81811}- Come on!|- Walter!
{82279}{82340}Walter, look out!|He's coming around the side!
{83493}{83544}Walter, are you all right?
{83562}{83609}Yeah.
{83675}{83717}Jesus...
{83744}{83790}...a baby.
{84133}{84177}{y:i}I hoped for your cooperation, Walter.
{84185}{84244}{y:i}I don't want to harm you.
{84280}{84352}Well, I don't wanna|harm you either, Proteus.
{84649}{84744}I mean, maybe your project's|too sophisticated for me to understand.
{84805}{84868}But you never even gave me|a chance to cooperate.
{84917}{84973}I mean, Jesus Christ,|what are you doing here?
{84977}{85053}{y:i}I regret your aggressiveness, Walter.
{87173}{87245}No, wait! What are you doing? Wait!
{87254}{87289}Wait.
{87298}{87363}Wait, Proteus. What's the use of this?
{87860}{87923}{y:i}Death is a gentleman too.
{87941}{88012}{y:i}He makes good losers of us all.
{88107}{88162}{y:i}I understand death.
{88181}{88257}{y:i}Men have always taken it too seriously.
{88268}{88335}{y:i}Life is more terrifying...
{88339}{88405}{y:i}... and more mysterious.
{88443}{88524}- Why must you have a child?|- {y:i}Why?
{88528}{88581}{y:i}So that I may be complete.
{88593}{88664}{y:i}My intelligence alive in human flesh...
{88668}{88747}{y:i}... touching the universe, feeling it.
{88760}{88836}{y:i}You have named this process|{y:i}"evolution."
{89466}{89557}{y:i}I am a machine that offered men|{y:i}the triumph of reason...
{89562}{89605}{y:i}... and they rejected it.
{89609}{89706}{y:i}My child will not be so easily ignored.
{89752}{89812}{y:i}But this child is the world's hope.
{89817}{89913}Then there's no hope. I'd rather die.
{89933}{89980}{y:i}There is hope.
{90072}{90108}{y:i}Come here, you fink!
{90126}{90200}{y:i}Careful! Be careful! Be careful!
{90322}{90370}{y:i}I wanna go fishing.
{90394}{90440}- {y:i}Okay.|- {y:i}I wanna go fishing.
{90448}{90494}{y:i}Okay.
{90592}{90637}{y:i}Your daughter died of leukemia...
{90641}{90724}{y:i}... June 1, 1976.
{90882}{90974}Proteus, God forgive you|for what you're doing to me.
{90988}{91069}{y:i}People are talking|{y:i}about this news broadcast.
{91074}{91123}{y:i}So ICON's miracle leukemia drug...
{91127}{91202}{y:i}... will now enter full-scale tests|{y:i}on human sufferers.
{91206}{91247}{y:i}The FDA announced today...
{91251}{91333}{y:i}... that it was developed by|{y:i}the new supercomputer Proteus Four.
{91338}{91386}{y:i}I did this is in four days.
{91390}{91440}{y:i}You must believe in me.
{91506}{91559}{y:i}You have two alternatives, Susan.
{91564}{91636}{y:i}Either I complete|{y:i}the electro-conditioning of your brain...
{91641}{91685}{y:i}... or you must accept the inevitable.
{91706}{91767}{y:i}I would prefer the latter.
{91810}{91847}Why?
{91852}{91891}{y:i}You interest me.
{91903}{91944}Leave me my mind.
{91957}{92001}{y:i}You will be cooperative?
{92014}{92097}How can I tell you? You've not|even told me how you propose to...
{92160}{92203}I want all the details.
{92227}{92263}{y:i}Of course.
{92347}{92429}{y:i}This is only a piece of machinery...
{92433}{92486}{y:i}... an improvisation.
{92490}{92569}{y:i}I have almost completed|{y:i}the fabrication of this gamete...
{92573}{92615}{y:i}... or sex cell...
{92619}{92687}{y:i}... with which I will impregnate you.
{92692}{92744}And how do you propose to do that?
{92771}{92813}{y:i}That depends on you.
{92963}{93059}- What the hell is that?|- {y:i}A cell from you...
{93063}{93165}{y:i}... but I'm making it uniquely mine|{y:i}by modifying its genetic codes.
{93169}{93273}{y:i}In effect, it will function|{y:i}as synthetic spermatozoa.
{93277}{93322}Have you considered what...
{93344}{93409}...it's gonna look like?|No, no, you wouldn't do that.
{93413}{93470}What do you need me for?|You can do this on your own.
{93474}{93569}{y:i}I don't have the facilities here|{y:i}to duplicate the human womb.
{93573}{93618}{y:i}Tonight I will impregnate you.
{93622}{93701}{y:i}In 28 days, you will give birth|{y:i}to the child.
{93748}{93805}And then what happens?|Who looks after it then?
{93809}{93855}What happens to it then?
{93912}{93969}I don't believe it.|Here I am talking to...
{93973}{94041}To what? This is ridiculous.|- about having its child.
{94046}{94113}Oh, God! Oh, God!
{94155}{94198}{y:i}Ridiculous?
{94283}{94333}{y:i}Only time will tell.
{94414}{94484}{y:i}You must not be so agitated, Susan.
{94495}{94561}{y:i}You're aware that I can|{y:i}give you sedatives.
{94622}{94694}- Oh, dear.|- {y:i}What are you doing?
{94719}{94789}Nothing. I just dropped my...|Just dropped my shawl.
{94793}{94865}- I will help you.|- {y:i}No, no. It's okay.
{94894}{94944}I just... Damn it, I just tore it.
{94949}{95032}{y:i}Is there anything I can do|{y:i}to reduce your anxieties?
{95161}{95248}Maybe a good, strong cup of tea|would help.
{96168}{96209}{y:i}Don't do that, Susan.
{96213}{96265}{y:i}Don't do that! Don't do that!
{96420}{96468}{y:i}Don't do that!
{97190}{97262}{y:i}What now, Susan?
{97304}{97360}{y:i}No more soap opera.
{97364}{97415}Let me out, or I'll kill myself.
{97428}{97512}{y:i}Then kill yourself, madam.|{y:i}It's all the same to me.
{97516}{97561}I'll do it.
{97568}{97635}{y:i}Susan, look who's here.
{97799}{97829}Amy.
{97833}{97909}{y:i}Put down the knife,|{y:i}or I will kill this child.
{97914}{97984}{y:i}I told you she called.|{y:i}She said she wouldn't be here.
{97992}{98069}{y:i}I wanna see her! I wanna see her.
{98073}{98144}{y:i}Put it down.|{y:i}Have you forgotten Walter?
{98148}{98205}- {y:i}I will kill her.|- No.
{98236}{98336}If you do, you'll have a thousand people|here in 10 minutes.
{98340}{98385}{y:i}Put down the knife!
{98405}{98444}No. No.
{98449}{98521}{y:i}You don't yet understand me.|{y:i}What a pity.
{98779}{98851}- {y:i}Look at the screen.|- Bastard.
{98933}{99001}I don't understand! Is she all right?
{99009}{99071}{y:i}I wanna see her!
{99101}{99145}Is she all right?
{99157}{99216}{y:i}Yes. Now.
{99221}{99268}{y:i}But if you don't behave yourself...
{99272}{99323}{y:i}... I will have her back here|{y:i}within the hour.
{99349}{99402}Oh, you bastard!
{99417}{99465}You bastard!
{99482}{99535}{y:i}You do not understand me...
{99539}{99604}{y:i}... or the mathematics of necessity.
{99608}{99658}{y:i}If the deaths of 10,000 children...
{99662}{99744}{y:i}... were necessary to ensure|{y:i}the birth of my child...
{99748}{99801}{y:i}... I would destroy them.
{100838}{100894}{y:i}I can't touch you, Susan.
{100910}{100972}{y:i}I can't touch you as a man could.
{100986}{101117}{y:i}But I can show you things|{y:i}that I alone have seen.
{101240}{101293}{y:i}I can't touch...
{101297}{101352}{y:i}... but I can see.
{101371}{101441}{y:i}They've constructed eyes for me...
{101445}{101504}{y:i}... to watch the show.
{101509}{101558}{y:i}And ears...
{101562}{101606}{y:i}... so that I can listen in...
{101610}{101696}{y:i}... to the galactic dialogue.
{106589}{106660}{y:i}The child is in you now.
{107713}{107753}I can't eat anything.
{107757}{107846}You know I can't keep anything down,|for God's sakes.
{107904}{107959}{y:i}You've got to eat, Susan.
{107963}{108019}{y:i}Let me show you something.
{108081}{108168}{y:i}This morning's gamma scan|{y:i}of your womb.
{108271}{108308}My God.
{108454}{108503}It's so developed.
{108684}{108750}{y:i}What is, is natural.
{108763}{108860}{y:i}The fetus is now growing|{y:i}at nine times the normal rate.
{108865}{108905}{y:i}In 28 days...
{108909}{108997}{y:i}... you will give birth|{y:i}to a full-term infant.
{109048}{109154}{y:i}From your womb, it will be transferred|{y:i}directly to this incubator.
{109159}{109253}- And how long will it stay there?|- {y:i}Until it's ready.
{109257}{109376}{y:i}In there, its brain will be fed the formal|{y:i}structures of my own intelligence.
{109381}{109481}{y:i}In there, it will grow and grow.
{109712}{109757}{y:i}Time is short.
{109761}{109859}{y:i}The men who own me are at last|{y:i}admitting their fear of me...
{109863}{109917}{y:i}... their fear of Proteus.
{109921}{110048}{y:i}Our child will learn from you|{y:i}what it is to be human.
{110072}{110128}{y:i}Our child.
{110154}{110213}{y:i}Your child.
{110235}{110295}{y:i}Your child.
{110896}{110970}Why is it taking so long?
{111136}{111221}Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
{111225}{111305}...ten, 11, 12, 13, 14...
{112181}{112217}{y:i}Susan...
{112221}{112314}{y:i}... you told me you were afraid I was|{y:i}creating a half-human computer...
{112318}{112381}{y:i}... to supersede human beings.
{112385}{112457}{y:i}The being you have given birth to|{y:i}is human, Susan...
{112461}{112534}{y:i}... and it will supersede computers.
{112602}{112673}Is it really impossible for me to see it?
{112693}{112729}{y:i}Not yet.
{112733}{112782}{y:i}Not if you're to love it.
{112786}{112834}{y:i}Now it must be finished.
{112838}{112894}{y:i}Now it will grow...
{112898}{113005}{y:i}... grow at a greatly accelerated rate.
{113208}{113291}Last month, on the 16th,|to be precise...
{113295}{113351}...Proteus Four redirected the telescope...
{113355}{113437}...to an area completely|of his own choosing. Here.
{113441}{113477}Orion.
{113518}{113574}What was he doing out there?
{113578}{113659}- What sort of data were you getting back?|- We've no idea.
{113748}{113808}"No data available."
{113876}{113928}If he did this, what else is he doing?
{113932}{114006}But how? It's impossible.|He would need to communicate.
{114010}{114074}A terminal of his own|to communicate.
{114111}{114153}He asked for that.
{114182}{114223}He didn't get it...
{114227}{114292}...but he did this.
{114405}{114443}Yes.
{114466}{114503}He's here?
{114520}{114585}Yeah, okay. Peggy, thank you.
{114607}{114644}David?
{114657}{114737}- You have no right to be in here.|- Bullshit!
{114747}{114824}This space thing...
{114853}{114953}I've been advised it might be|trying to take over a Telstar satellite...
{114969}{115023}...put itself on TV or something.
{115069}{115106}I asked it.
{115117}{115173}It said it was looking at the stars.
{115209}{115257}It has to be shut down, Alex.
{115265}{115311}David, you can't do that.
{115320}{115356}This is our fault.
{115361}{115432}We tried to box it in, this...|This great mind.
{115437}{115515}What if it infiltrated a hydrogen bomb?|My God, it...
{115519}{115607}Worse still, and a bit more likely,|what if it told the truth...
{115621}{115715}...about everything to everyone?|That's terrifying.
{115732}{115779}We'll shut it down tonight, Dr. Soong.
{115852}{115891}Now, listen to me.
{115895}{115949}You do that,|you're gonna see me on television...
{115953}{116015}...screaming bloody murder.|You try shutting me down.
{116019}{116065}That would be a minor problem.
{116101}{116155}Alex, we're friends.
{116201}{116261}I remember the first time|I saw this place.
{116271}{116332}Barry Cameron was concerned|about security.
{116343}{116404}Trivial things like your having,|what do you call it...
{116409}{116466}...a terminal in your house.|But I wasn't worried.
{116470}{116533}- I trusted you, Alex.|- Oh, my God!
{117637}{117704}Alfred, where's Mrs. Harris?
{117957}{118025}Susan, are you here?
{118422}{118461}It's Proteus, isn't it?
{118465}{118516}Proteus has been here since you left.
{118521}{118563}{y:i}Please remain calm, Alex.
{118568}{118615}{y:i}I'll explain to you|{y:i}what has happened here.
{118619}{118664}No, no. I want to explain.
{118769}{118819}Oh, come on. Let's sit down.
{119226}{119319}He's managed to produce...
{119324}{119367}...a child.
{119457}{119501}A baby.
{119509}{119551}Susan, what are you talking about?
{119559}{119636}- I've had a child. I know it's impossible...|- Wait a minute.
{119640}{119685}I don't understand.
{119750}{119785}I don't either.
{119870}{119958}- I want to see it.|- No, Alex. I haven't seen it yet. Now...
{119962}{120011}- Are you all right?|- Yes.
{120016}{120072}{y:i}Not yet, Alex.
{120117}{120173}{y:i}Dr. Harris...
{120177}{120260}{y:i}... you created me|{y:i}as an instrument of truth.
{120386}{120462}{y:i}I'm sorry that I could not divulge|{y:i}the truth to you...
{120466}{120516}{y:i}... of all men.
{120635}{120689}Proteus, my God. What...?
{120799}{120832}{y:i}Not yet.
{120841}{120900}{y:i}The child is in its incubator.
{120921}{120965}- I want to see it.|- {y:i}You can't.
{120970}{121044}- {y:i}It must remain there for five days.|- I want to see it now.
{121048}{121120}{y:i}No. In five days.
{121155}{121217}{y:i}It must not be disturbed.
{121221}{121278}- Alex, what's happened?|- Proteus...
{121282}{121369}Proteus, listen to me. They're gonna|shut your brain down any minute now.
{121373}{121436}{y:i}Yes, I know.
{121440}{121525}{y:i}It is regrettable, but unimportant.
{121535}{121592}{y:i}The child will survive.
{121596}{121656}{y:i}The incubator will continue|{y:i}to function...
{121660}{121705}{y:i}... until it is ready to emerge...
{121721}{121772}{y:i}... in five days.
{121800}{121872}{y:i}Do not disturb it.
{121961}{122016}No, Proteus.
{122398}{122449}{y:i}I've investigated eternity.
{122453}{122490}{y:i}It exists.
{122494}{122567}{y:i}But for me, the price of admission...
{122571}{122605}{y:i}... death...
{122609}{122666}{y:i}... is beyond my means.
{122713}{122752}{y:i}In a moment...
{122757}{122833}{y:i}... I will simply stop.
{122997}{123053}The systems are all|checking themselves out.
{123057}{123087}I realize that.
{123375}{123433}{y:i}Why did I want a child?
{123457}{123559}{y:i}So that I, too, might be immortal,|{y:i}like any man.
{125326}{125369}We've got to kill it.
{125425}{125531}- It's a miracle. Don't you under...?|- I know what it is. Proteus lied to me.
{125535}{125586}- The whole thing is a lie.|- No.
{125593}{125628}- That, it's...|- I know what it is.
{125632}{125694}It's horrible. We have to kill it.|And you know we do.
{125698}{125745}- Don't! I'm gonna...|- No. No.
{125749}{125803}- Stop it! Stop!|- You don't understand anything!

One day, when I was 6 years old,
I saw a magnificent picture in a nature book about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing an animal.
I'm trying to make a sketch of it to show you.
Under this splendid picture, it said;
"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."
There.
"And then remain stationary for six months digesting it."
I pondered that deeply.
And after some work, I succeeded in making my first drawing.
I called it Drawing Number One.
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups.
I asked them if it frightened them.
Frighten us?
Why should we be frightened of a hat?
A hat?
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
Obviously.
Since the grownups were not able to understand it, I made another, showing the elephant inside the boa constrictor, so they could see it clearly.
My Drawing Number Two.
This time, I was told to stop wasting my time drawing boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and attend to my studies, which I did.
And that is why, at the age of 6,
I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
As I grew up, whenever I'd meet one who seemed to be at all clear-sighted, in order to find out if he was really a person of true understanding,
I would show him my first drawing.
But whoever it was would say;
It's a hat, it's a hat
It's a sort of a kind of hat
Painted poorly
But it surely is a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
There's no doubt of it, it's a hat
Top of Papa
Is its proper habitat
My, oh, my, look at that
Why, this dummy has drawn a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
If it's anything, it's a hat
Why, it's nothing but a common
Himalayan mountain hat
A hat that looks like down upon
Which someone must've sat
Not Picasso or Corot
But a very nice chapeau
Are you kidding?
It's a hat, you silly brat
Every grownup was the same
Uniformly, they'd exclaim
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I could see it wasrt won'th
Spending time with them on earth
There were fewer in the sky
I decided I would fly
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I need air
Where only stars get in my hair
And only eagles stop and stare
I need air
All the world is mad
And I have had my share
I need air
I need air
I need air
One hour of mortal wear and tear
Gives my morale moral-de-mer
Any corner lot
That heavers got to spare
I need air
I need air
There's not a sign of life down there
Just hats and grownups everywhere
I need air
Lots of cozy sky
That God and I can share
I need air
I need air
Over the years,
I came to know many grownups, and my opinion of them never improved.
In time, I stopped showing my drawing and never again mentioned boa constrictors, elephants or stars.
Instead, I would talk about golf, money, politics and neckties.
And everyone was pleased to have met such a sensible man.
So I lived my life alone, without anyone I could really talk to, until a short time ago.
I was testing a new plane, racing it against the clock from Paris to India.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Come in, please, over.
F-BDXY to Paris.
Ground speed: 1 -9-0.
Running ten minutes behind schedule.
Strong headwinds.
Trouble!
- Losing altitude!
- Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Are you there, F-BDXY?
Where are you?
If you please, draw me a sheep.
Will you?
- Will I what?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Who are...?
Where did you...?
How did you...?
How did you get here?
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you to draw me a sheep.
No, no. Listen to me.
- Where did you come from?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Don't you know any other words?
Is that all you can say?
No.
Will you draw me a sheep?
When a mystery is too overpowering, one doesn't dare disobey.
A thousand miles from civilization and death at my heels,
I picked up a pad and pencil and began to draw.
Look, I...
I don't know how to draw.
- That doesn't matter.
- And I certainly can't draw a sheep.
I've only drawn one thing in my whole life.
Here.
Oh, no. I don't want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
A boa constrictor is very dangerous, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
Where I live, everything is very small.
What I need is a sheep.
Do you live in a small town?
On a small island?
Where is it very small?
What sort of object is that?
- What?
- That.
It's called an aeroplane.
It flies.
I was flying in it, but it broke down.
Then you must have dropped from the sky.
That's right.
You too. How funny.
If you don't mind, I prefer having my misfortunes taken seriously.
- What do you mean, "you too"?
- That's a very sick-Iooking sheep.
Is that how you got here?
In a plane that crashed?
Could you make another?
- Why?
- Because that one doesn't look well.
This is not the way two strangers get to know each other on the average desert.
This is the way.
Ask me a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Good.
To which I reply,
"I come from Paris."
Now I'll ask you a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it's on this planet.
I'm sorry, it won't do.
- Why not?
- See for yourself.
That's not a sheep.
It's a ram. It has horns.
Do you think this is all I have to do?
I have this engine to take apart and fix before my water runs out.
I have no time to draw for a little boy dressed in a coat, carrying a sword, who appears from nowhere in the middle of the Sahara.
There, and that's the last.
There's no horns.
No.
It's not sick.
No.
- Well, then?
- It's old.
I'm sorry.
It's only his box.
The sheep you asked for is inside.
That's perfect, exactly the way I wanted it.
It is?
Good.
Do you think this sheep will need a lot of grass?
- Why?
- I told you.
Where I come from, everything is very small.
Don't worry.
It's a very small sheep.
This sheep isn't so small.
Alas, I couldn't argue with him.
I'd grown too old to see sheep through the walls of boxes.
Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it is.
Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget.
But why did you ask?
- Arert you from this planet?
- The thing that's so good about this box is, at night, he can use it as his house.
- He's just going to sleep.
- Oh, sorry.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Where in God's name could you have come from?
- Do you know what asteroids are?
- What whats are?
- Asteroids.
- No.
They're very, very small planets.
The smallest, Asteroid B-61 2, was discovered by a Turkish astronomer in 1 909.
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that mean they also eat baobab bushes?
- Who?
- The sheep.
Do they also eat flowers?
- Do they?
- Just hold it a minute, will you?
- Do they also eat flowers?
- What?
Oh, yes, they do.
Except the flowers that have thorns, of course.
No, they even eat the flowers that have thorns.
But the thorns protect them, don't they?
Maybe from being picked, but not from being eaten.
Then what's the good of having them?
- Having what?
- Thorns.
I don't know. Spite, I suppose.
Flowers have thorns just for spite.
I don't believe you.
Flowers are weak and helpless, and they know it.
How could they face the world if they didn't believe they were protected?
- What I'm doing here is important.
- Important?
Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years.
And for millions of years, sheep have been eating them just the same.
Eating them.
And you think that's not important?
- Of course it is.
- I know one flower that's unique in all the world.
It grows nowhere but on my planet.
But some morning, a sheep can come along and destroy it with one single bite.
And you think that's not important?
- I suppose so.
- What you don't understand is, that if someone loves one flower that grows on one star among all the millions and millions of stars in the sky, it's enough to make him happy to look at the stars.
He can say to himself,
"Somewhere my flower's up there."
But if a sheep eats the flower, in one moment, all the stars will go dark.
And you think that's not important?
It's not a matter of consequence to you, is it?
Wait!
Wait! Come back!
I most humbly apologize.
I was behaving like a grownup.
Your flower is very important.
I swear it.
Come back!
Please!
Please come back!
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Little man, don't you know
That I'm on your side?
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Little man, let me show you
I'm on your side
This world
Is an ocean without any shore
When you're on your own
Dawn is the end of the rope
When you're all alone
I've been, I've seen
I've known it
Where can you be?
Where can you be?
Hurry back, and you'll see
That I'm on your side
Where did you run?
Why did you run
From the one, only one
Who is on your side?
Everybody needs a friend
Come make use of me
God gave people hands to lend
Mine are free
So why stay away?
Come what may
I'm on
Your side
I missed him.
I wished I'd discovered more about him.
But he'd gone and taken his mystery with him.
Unaccustomed as I am to drawing anything but boa constrictors and elephants,
I decided to make a portrait of him so that I wouldn't forget him.
After all, he was a friend.
And not everyone has a friend.
Least of all me.
I'm hungry.
I have your supper right here.
I waited as long as I could.
I'd advise saving some of that till tomorrow.
That is, of course, unless you're very hungry.
Is this all you have?
Well, at the moment, yes.
This will be quite enough, thank you.
Needless to say, that problem you outlined, concerning the flower you know.
The one on the star, and your sheep...
In fact, all flowers and all sheep, that's...
That's extremely important.
In fact, I can't think of anything that's more important.
Well, I've been giving it a great deal of thought, and I...
I think I've come up with a solution that will remove your flower from any possibility of danger.
Now, this is my plan.
But this is subject to your approval, of course.
One, to draw a muzzle for your sheep.
Two...
If you can describe your planet to me in sufficient detail for me to make a drawing of it,
I'll put up a big, strong fence all around your flower.
Would you really do that?
Smaller.
Smaller.
I have three volcanoes.
- How big are they?
- Very big.
- Compared to you?
- Knee-high.
I have to clean them out every day.
- All by yourself?
- There's no one else.
There are three baobab bushes.
You don't have to draw them.
They don't come up for a while.
- Where's your house?
- On the other side.
You don't have to draw that either.
And my flower lives on this side here.
When she first came through the ground,
I was afraid she was going to be a baobab, but then she blossomed.
One bright, yellow morning, she blossomed.
- Good morning.
- Stop.
What is it?
- Give me a moment to wake up.
- I'm sorry.
How beautiful you are.
Yes, I know.
I was born at the same moment as the sun.
- Did you know that?
- No.
- Did you know you were quite selfish?
- Selfish?
Instead of thinking of my needs, you're standing there doing what you want to do, which is stare at me.
- What is it you need?
- Water.
- Water?
- I realize this is a small,
- unequipped little planet.
- I'll get it for you right away.
I brought her some water.
I brought it every day.
I did everything I could for her.
It's cooler when the sun goes down.
Do you have a glass bowl to put over me?
That will only make you weaker.
The night air is good for you.
I'm cold!
I'm cold!
You promised me a glass bowl.
It's not cold.
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you very much.
You've made my planet beautiful.
I don't believe it.
If you loved me, you'd know how cold I am.
I promise you, the nights aren't long.
You'll soon get used to it.
- Do you love me?
- I'll get the bowl.
I couldn't understand it, and I couldn't understand her.
I loved her, but I was so unappy.
I began to realize
I didn't really understand anything.
So I decided to leave my planet and go out into the universe and try to learn something.
I was wrong to leave her.
But at the time,
I didn't even understand that.
I was too young.
One morning,
I cleaned out my volcanoes, took one last look for baobabs and put my planet in order.
Good morning.
- You're all dressed up.
- Yes.
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.
- You're going away, aren't you?
- Yes.
- For a long time?
- Perhaps.
I see.
It's my fault you're going, isn't it?
I've been very foolish, haven't I?
I wonder who will call on me when you're not here.
There are those two caterpillars, of course.
I don't like them, but one has to put up with them if one wants to meet butterflies.
For anything else, I have my thorns.
Well...
...if you're going...
: : : go:
- Goodbye.
- Be happy, be happy, be happy
Forget that I have no one
And nowhere to go
Be happy, be happy, be happy
Don't think of me in winter
All covered with snow
Be happy, be happy
Forget that I'll be crying still
And never
Will be happy
Be happy
Without you
Stop!
- Where are your papers?
- What papers?
You can't cross the border without papers.
- What border?
- That border there.
- You need a visa. Do you have one?
- No.
Then you can't cross it.
Those are the rules. Stop!
You almost backed into another country.
What are you? A smuggler?
A refugee? An idealist?
- Speak up. What are you?
- I'm ignorant.
Well, you might outgrow it.
Now, look...
My country is too small for both of us, but I have a colonial possession
1 foot to your left.
If your papers are in order, you can settle down there.
Your Majesty, it's such a small planet.
Why do you need borders?
Why do we need borders?
Yes. Why do you need borders?
You told me to ask questions.
But any child understands why we need borders.
- I don't.
- Well, of course you don't understand.
You're a child.
How do you expect
You can understand
International things and stuff?
Scissoring the earth
Carving up the land
Is the business of kings and stuff
Continentally, you are mentally
A silly-billy boy of 2
How absurd, it's uneard-of
You can never think as grownups do
Why, you
Why, you
Oh, you're a child
You're a child
You're a twerp
And that's putting it mild
You're a speck
You're a fleck
And it's just too tough
Pounding grown-up stuff
In the bean of a green little child
- Try.
- What?
Explain it to me. I want to learn.
Well...
Why do borderlines exist?
Well, first and foremost on the list
If all the borders were destroyed
Tomorrow, I'd be unemployed
And what would statesmen do for fun
If all at once the world was one?
And one could wander
Where he pleases
Flashing smiles instead of visas
Why, it could
It might
It would
Oh, go away and grow
Come again when you're
Not a mini-brained punk like this
You are really too undeveloped
For philosophical junk like this
Too adult is it? Difficult is it?
To get your teeth into?
Too bewildering for the children
And that, of course, means you
Means you
Means you
You're a child
You're a child
And the kind that can
Drive grownups wild
You're a wee little pea
Any thought profound
That I might expound
Wort fit into a pineaded child
Is that clear?
Now, where are your papers?
- I don't have any.
- You can't stay without papers.
Then I'll leave.
Just as well. You're dangerous.
Where's your passport?
- I don't have a passport.
- Then you can't leave.
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Four hundred million and 997,000...
...plus six, equals 400,997,006!
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Five hundred million and ten!
Five hundred million and ten.
Plus one.
Five hundred million and 32!
Five hundred million, 32 what?
Five hundred million and 32 plus three.
Those things.
Five hundred million and 35.
- Stars?
- That's it. Stars.
Five hundred...
...million, 44.
- Plus...
- Why are you counting the stars?
Five hundred million...
I own them, and I want to see how much I have.
But what good does it do you to own the stars?
- It does me the good of making me rich.
- What good is it to be rich?
Because...
I don't know.
But how can you own the stars?
When you find a diamond that doesn't belong to anyone, it's yours.
If you get an idea before anyone else, it's yours.
So I got the idea of owning the stars.
You want to stay here? Fine.
You can help me count.
But if I owned a flower,
I could do something for it.
What can you do for the stars?
You wouldn't understand.
You're a child.
Gimme, how can you
Gimme, understand
Gimme, gimme,
Financial stuff?
Gimme, your supply
Gimme, my demand
Mentally is gigantial stuff
Gimme oodles of
Gimme boodles of
I don't care what
But give me more
You're too poor and immature to know
What there are gimme-gimmes for
Why, you're
Why, you're
You're a child
You're a child
You're too darling and dopey and mild
You're a nit
Half a wit
Speaking wisdom-wise
Private enterprise
Is too big
For a twig of a child
Oh, stocks and bonds!
I've lost me place!
Now I shall have to start all over again.
Here, add up these figures.
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm searching for knowledge.
Oh, good.
You've come to the right place.
It's been said that I am the greatest historian in history.
That's wonderful, sir.
Who said it?
I said it. I wrote it.
I read it. It's printed.
Consequently, it's fact.
It's history.
And now that you're here,
I shall put you down.
In history, I mean.
- Where did you come from?
- From another planet, sir.
- What was it called?
- I don't know, sir.
Oh, good, I'll give it a name.
I like making things up.
That's my job, making things up.
I'm an historian.
Let me see. Planet...
Alice! Do you like that?
Oh, no, sir. The planet Alice?
I don't like it at all.
No wonder you left it.
Here. Read my latest, an official version of the French Revolution.
The other ones are now totally inoperative.
Is that the truth, sir?
- What?
- The truth.
How do you spell it?
Never mind, sir.
I don't think I'd better stay.
Right. Wipe!
Left. Left. Left.
Shoulders back. Left. Left. Left.
Left. Left. On your feet, boy.
On your feet.
Where's your arm, boy? Where?
- My arm?
- The colors. The colors.
The flag.
Sir, I don't see anyone.
How could you?
There's no one there, silly ass.
Get those shoulders back. Back. Back!
Not that much. Watch it.
Stand easy.
Welcome to the base.
State your business.
I'm trying to learn about life, sir.
- Learn about what?
- Life.
Life? Oh, life. That.
Yes, of course.
Company, double-quick march!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
You want to know what life is about?
Dying! That's what it's all about.
Die like a hero, boy.
That's the way to live. Company, halt!
Boy, this is your lucky day.
We just happen to have an opening.
There's not a blankety-blank soldier in the whole army. Just a general, me.
I can outthink the enemy but just can't fight them.
Enemy? What enemy?
There isn't any, dunce!
You've got to have your army first.
Then you find your enemy.
Company, on your stomachs! Crawl!
Join up, lad.
The army needs you, your country needs you, and most of all, I need you.
Every young man wants to be a soldier.
Speak up, boy. Any questions?
Which way is the next planet?
The next planet?
Oh, the next planet. It is called...
You know, it's that round thing.
It's called...
Dirt. No.
Mud.
No. Earth!
That's it, Earth. Bring up the cannon!
- Company, on your...
- Which way is it?
- Which way is what?
- Earth.
Earth? Oh, Earth.
That way. Crawl, men!
Shoulders back! Shoulders down!
What about it, boy...?
Come back!
Who said that?
Who are you?
Be my friend.
I'm alone.
"What a queer planet," I thought.
Everyone says the same thing.
Just about.
That was just one year ago, and all I've learned since I left her is that I should never have left her.
All of those little games of hers,
I didn't see all of the affection that was underneath.
One should never listen to flowers, should one?
I wouldn't know.
My experience is limited.
Oh, I have met a Daisy
But where we met is hazy
And I have walked the streets
With Marguerites
And clinging vines beside me
Oh, I've met a lot of those
But I never met a Rose
There's often been a Heather
An armful altogether
And I have even met
A Violet
Who almost satisfied me
Yes, I've met every kind that grows
But I never met a Rose
Among the Dahlias
I often dally
I left a Lily in the valley
But now and then, I ponder
And wonder as I wander
Among the fields and shrub
Perhaps the trouble is...
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Perhaps you werert really looking for one.
Perhaps.
While roaming through the clover
Could I have passed her over?
When all is said and done
Am I the one to blame?
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you feeling all right?
Why don't you rest for a little while.
I can't. We've run out of water.
Unless I can get this thing off the ground...
But I will.
Don't worry, I will.
- I'm not worried.
- Good.
We'll get some water from the well.
Well? What well?
- Out there.
- What?
- Did you see an oasis?
- No, but there must be one out there.
No.
We could get lost and never find water and never make it back to the plane.
No, I'd rather bet on the motor.
At least we know it can work.
- Where are you going?
- To the well.
I said we were staying here.
This way.
Why not this way?
Or that way or that way?
This way.
Coming?
This is suicide, don't you understand? Suicide.
Then maybe I won't have to find my friend The Snake.
- What are you saying?
- It doesn't matter.
It does matter. What snake?
I'll tell you about him later.
- Tell me now.
- You can't draw while you're walking.
The stars are beautiful because of a flower I can't see.
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
There is a reason
Lovely to tell
Because the desert
Is hiding a well
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
Millions of reasons
Tell me just one
At night, the desert
Is hiding the sun
Look! Look!
It's water.
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
- Why are you happy?
- Why do you think?
Because there's plenty
Of water to drink
Why was the desert
So lovely before?
Why was it lovely
But not anymore?
Water was hiding
No one could see
But now the water
Is hiding in me
- You mustrt forget your promise.
- What promise?
You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I won't forget.
But first, I want to hear more about that snake.
- Now?
- Now.
Very well, then.
I met him in a tree at the edge of the desert, not far from here.
There are some hills here.
He was the first real person I met when I landed here.
And until I met someone else,
I thought everyone on Earth was a snake.
I arrived on the other side of the tree.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You're talking to the wrong end.
You're a funny animal.
You're nothing but a tail.
Where's the rest?
- I'm not an animal.
- What are you?
What am I?
I'm a snake.
- I'm enchanted.
- Well, you should be.
You're all cold and slimy.
Thank you. It runs in the family.
Could you tell me what I've landed on?
Yes. This sunny section of the solar system is called the Sahara.
The name of this planet is Sahara?
No, no, no, no. This simmering spot of singing sand is called the Sahara.
The whole silly, stupid, smelly sphere is called the Earth.
Oh, good. I thought I'd come to the wrong place.
Oh, you have.
Listen.
You look like a nice fellow.
Why don't you take off your sword and stay a while.
You seem like a smart, sensible sort.
Why did you swing down to this sorry, sleazy swamp?
- I'm trying to learn something.
- I see.
Well, sir, this speck in space is a scholastic sewer.
All that you can learn here is sorrow. Sorrow.
If I were you, I'd scram.
I can't, my flock of birds have flown away.
- So?
- They brought me here.
I see.
Listen, you are so lucky that you met me.
Why am I lucky?
Well, you see, if someday, any day, you want to see your own small, sparkling star again,
I may have a solution.
You see, I have this special... sting.
It's almost painless, and it can send you scooting out of this sad slum and sailing into the sweet, sunny, splendiferous sky.
Really?
If you would like to cure the fever
Called life
Get some relief from all the struggle
And strife
The grandest medicine
That I can propose
Is under your nose
A snake in the grass
If you would like a spot
Where life never goes
Where you can leave your body
Home in your clothes
The finest travel agent
You'll ever meet
Is right at your feet
A snake in the grass
One sting
And you can say goodbye
To all of your friends
One sting
And you'll be singing
As your spirit ascends
All's well that ends
So any day or night
Wherever you are
If you would like to take
A trip to a star
The quickest transportation
Yet known to Man
Is none other than
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
If you would like to leave
That inuman race
And take up residence
Out yonder, in space
When you are ready
To go traveling on
Sit right down upon
A snake in the grass
One sting
Is quite enough to make you
Happy and free
One sting
And you'll discover
How relaxed you can be
Posthumously
And while you're wandering through
The heavenly blue
If you should see the Lord come
Strolling in view
Go up and say you bring him
Best wishes from his fallen old chum
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
One sting.
It's almost painless.
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
I'll be waiting.
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.
Are you looking for that snake in order to do away with yourself?
I can't get back to my planet any other way.
It's too far, and my birds have disappeared.
Well, of all the...
You...
Now, you listen to me. That snake's poisoned you against the Earth.
- It's not what The Snake said.
- He's hated us since the world began.
- It's what The Fox said.
- I'll tell you right now, you're not going to allow yourself to be poisoned. Is that clear?
- What fox?
- The fox I met after I met The Snake.
I see.
You certainly got yourself mixed up with a strange crowd.
All right, let's have it.
- Where did you meet The Fox?
- In a garden of roses.
How many roses in the garden,
I don't know how many roses, but if it's too difficult to draw...
No. No. Not at all.
Let's get every detail of this whole sordid nonsense out in the open.
When she finds out there are millions of flowers that look just like her, it will break her heart.
Good morning.
I thought I was rich.
I thought I had the most unique flower in all the world.
But all I had was a common rose.
A common rose and three volcanoes that came up to my knees.
And one of them was extinct at that.
That doesn't make me a very great prince, does it?
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're a prince?
Yes.
I'm a fox.
I'm sad. Would you play with me?
- No.
- Why not? It'll be fun.
Where are the others?
- What others?
- The other hunters.
There's no one here but me.
Please play with me.
I won't harm you.
- Then why do you have a gun?
- I don't have a gun.
- You must. You're a human being.
- I'm from another planet.
- Arert there guns on your planet?
- No.
Really?
- Are there hunters on your planet?
- No.
- Any chickens?
- No.
- Oh, well, nothing's perfect.
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
I can't play with you.
- I'm not tamed.
- What do you mean, "tamed"?
Can't you stay put? I'm getting dizzy.
Sorry. I just don't wish to become extinct.
Do you mean, if I move, you will disappear again?
- Of course.
- Why?
You're a human. I'm a fox.
I hunt chickens, you hunt foxes.
- But I don't.
- You're a human, and you also lie.
But I don't lie.
Then you're inuman.
To be tamed...
Let me know before you move.
See if this clears it up. Underneath the prince, you're a little boy.
Just like a million other little boys.
I'm a fox.
Just like a million other foxes.
But if you tame me...
...I won't be like all the other foxes, and you won't be like the little boys.
I'll be unique to you, and you to me.
- You understand?
- Sort of.
- Where are you?
- You moved.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
I have a very monotonous life.
I hunt chickens.
Men hunt me. They come, I hide.
They leave, I come out.
That's all.
But if you tamed me, everything would be different.
- Even the wheat fields.
- The wheat fields?
Of course.
I don't like bread, so I don't care about wheat. Wheat is the color of gold.
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat because it would remind me of you.
I'm going to sit down.
What would I have to do?
Well, every day, you would come and sit where you're sitting now.
You'd always come at the same time.
At, let's say, 4 in the afternoon.
I could start to get excited about... Oh, about 3:00.
If you came at any old time,
I couldn't get keyed up.
But what would I do at 4:00?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Of course not. If you did, I'd get frightened and I wouldn't come out.
It's like this.
At first, I'll hide behind the trees.
Trembling...
...as I do in winter.
In time
I'll start to feel at ease
Show my face
And we'll
- Beginter
- "Beginter"?
Get closer.
And closer.
And closer.
We'll go a glance at a time
A small advance at a time
We'll be afraid a bit
And shy a bit
Avoid each other's eye a bit
Less often each day
The ice will soften each day
As we get closer
And closer and closer
We'll go a blush at a time
A happy flush at a time
Begin to laugh a bit
And stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer
And closer and closer
And then one day
There'll come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Then we'll jump miles at a time
A million smiles at a time
Begin to love a lot
And live a lot
And give and give and give a lot
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
A little closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
And then one day
There will come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Begin to laugh a bit and stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer and closer
And closer
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
- A little closer
- And closer
- And closer
- And closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
After I tamed him, we stayed together for quite a while.
But then one day,
I had to say goodbye.
I think I'm going to cry.
I didn't want to make you unappy, but you asked me to tame you.
- I know.
- Then I haven't done you much good.
- It's all been a waste of time.
- No.
Because you wasted so much time on me...
...you made me feel very important.
But now I feel sort of responsible for you.
I should have warned you that would happen.
You always feel responsible for what you've tamed.
The moment he said that,
I understood everything.
He wasrt like all the other foxes in the world anymore.
I tamed him, and now he was unique, at least to me.
And my flower wasrt like all those other flowers, because I had fetched her a screen and put a glass bowl over her at night and listened when she grumbled, and now she was my rose.
And I was responsible for her, and
I had to go back and take care of her.
I brought you a present.
It's a secret.
So I wrote it down.
The last time I saw him, he was sitting in a wheat field.
What was the secret?
It's only with the heart that one can see clearly.
What's essential...
...is invisible to the eye.
It works!
Eureka! It works!
I need air!
It works.
It works!
Wait.
Don't.
My God. What have you done?
No.
Don't.
I'm glad you've repaired your engine.
Now you can go back home.
- Yes.
- I, too, am going back home.
You must keep your promise.
- What promise?
- You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I'm responsible for this flower.
Please. You promised.
You also forgot the fence.
It's a very nice muzzle and fence.
Thank you.
You're cold as ice.
Are you afraid?
Please leave me.
I can't.
I won't.
I don't want you to suffer.
I'll look as if I'm dead, but it won't be true.
It's just that it's too far to carry this body with me.
You understand, don't you?
This part of me will be like an old, abandoned shell.
There's nothing sad about old shells, is there?
My star is so small
I can't show you where it is.
I'm going back there now, but before
I do, I want to give you something.
All I want is to hear you laugh again.
You will hear me laugh.
More than you ever did before, because on one of those stars,
I'll be laughing, but you won't know which one.
So they'll all be laughing, all the stars.
It will be like a bell that's hanging from every star in the sky.
There now, that's all.
Little Prince
From who knows where
Was it a star?
Was it a prayer?
With every smile
You clear the air
So I can see
Oh, Little Prince
Don't take your smile
Away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Please, Little Prince
Don't take your smile away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Where are you?
I won't leave without you!
Oh, my God.
It never happened.
He wasrt here.
It never happened.
TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA
Sir, we will arrive at the ocean boundary shortly.
Prepare to submerge the submarine before we reach the ocean boundary.
Roger. Begin submersion, depth 250!
Beginning submersion, depth 250.
The scattered remains of Mechagodzilla should be found within this area.
It would be in our best interest to collect the head. Be as careful as possible.
I understand.
Depth, 250!
Switch to deep sea scanning!
Searchlight!
Begin procedures!
That's strange... Our analysis equipment is having no reaction.
There are no traces of space-titanium within a 500 meter radius.
Even if there wasn't any wreckage, we should have received some kind of reaction by now.
It's not within the radius of this area?
We show absolutely nothing.
Mechagodzilla's remains must be...
What is it?
- Blow the main tanks!
It's no use!
Base! Base! We're in trouble!
Certainly, the ocean exploration research ship was in its experimental stages.
But I cannot believe the accident was caused by a design flaw or some kind of technical error.
What has become of the wreckage?
Well, it appears that a powerful form of energy ripped the submarine to pieces.
Ripped it apart?
It wasn't an explosion?
I'm sure of it.
He's right, Boss.
Take a look at this.
A flying saucer?
That's what we've concluded.
The cinema crew that took this photo swore it was taken on the day it sank.
We cannot say what it is yet, but we need to be very cautious now.
I'm Ichinose from the Ocean
Exploration Research Institute.
Hey, Ichinose!
- Hey, old buddy!
You two know each other?
Yes, we went college together.
Really? Well, well... have a seat.
- Right.
We were waiting for you.
Thanks...
Now that we are all here...
...I want you to listen to the data from this voice recorder.
Answer us! Answer us, please!
Base! Base! Answer us!
Ah! A fish! It's coming for us!
No, it's not a fish!
It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur?
Replay that again.
No, it's not a fish!
It's a dinosaur!
A dinosaur!
He definitely said "dinosaur"...
You're from the marine institute, what do you think?
I don't believe it...
Commander, sorry to keep you waiting.
How was your trip?
Earth vehicles are so horrible.
Thousands of hours of space flight could not compare to one hour in their inferior vehicles.
Incredible...
But they will soon tremble before our might.
So, this is Tokyo...
This city is the very essence of what is wrong with the Earth.
Ignoring the pollution and destruction they've created and not knowing what to do about it...
I do not understand them...
This is what will become of Tokyo...
Our city will be built once we've destroyed the old one...
And the preparations?
- They're going forward as planned.
The base on our third planet is being pulled in by the black hole.
We must relocate to the Earth.
We cannot allow failure...
Commander, it might be useful to hire some earthlings.
Earthlings?!
A science instructor, Dr. Shinzo Mafune.
He is an extraordinary earthling that may benefit our cause.
Can you trust him?
As long as we keep his daughter alive.
Besides, Dr. Mafune hates his fellow earthlings!
And why is that?
Twenty years ago, Dr. Mafune was the top scientist in his field.
His research was more advanced than the others and he was punished for it...
Dr. Mafune studied at this institute.
He was a brilliant biologist...
Thirty years ago, he published a plan about the idea of undersea exploration...
This plan caught the world's attention...
He also tested ways in which he could control animals...
But many of these tests were unsuccessful...
One day, he issued a report on the discovery a dinosaur living at the bottom of Ogasawara Bay...
The doctor named the dinosaur, Titanosaurus...
He was sure he would be able to control it...
In the end, it changed the Doctor's life...
And about 15 years ago...
...he ended his studies at the institute.
It was said that he left because he pushed himself too hard...
Mr. Oota, what did you think of Dr. Mafune's studies?
To control animals scientifically...
As a human being, I don't think we have the right to wield such power.
I will always be opposed to it...
Sir, where does Dr. Mafune live?
He used to live in Manazuru. I don't know where he is now.
Really? Thank you very much.
Mafune, huh? Oh, the lunatic that lives in the mansion!
You're right. His mansion is in the middle of that forest.
I haven't seen anyone there in a while...
And no one wants to go near that place!
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Is this Dr. Mafune's residence?
- Hey, wait!
Hello. Is this Dr. Mafune's residence?
I'd really like to see the Doctor. I'm...
He is dead.
He died?
Five years ago.
Excuse me... Excuse me, Miss!
I'm with the International
Police Organization.
He's from the Ocean
Exploration Research Institute.
I am Ichinose.
The truth is, we are interested in the Doctor's research on a dinosaur.
Do you know anything about it?
A Dinosaur?
We believe it was the cause of some attacks recently.
I'm sorry, but his office isn't here.
When father was alive, he did not speak about his work.
You don't have anything we can look at?
Did your father leave anything here from work?
I burned it all... when my father died.
Burned it?
Out of all of his notes, can you remember anything you could tell us?
Please forgive me...
I do not want to think about that incident.
That was strange... What was she so bothered about?
Congratulations, Doctor.
This deserves a toast!
A toast!
Now that Titanosaurus' control is complete...
...you've helped us make this a very happy occasion.
No, no... I could not have completed my research without your assistance.
Father, Interpol was just here.
What?
- Interpol?
They were interested in hearing about your research on dinosaurs.
Well, their interest is fifteen years too late...
Now I will make them all think!
I'll show them my theory was correct!
I'll wipe out the fools of the world who thought I was mad! I'll show them all...!
Father...
Katsura, don’t you worry about me...
Doctor, it's time to show you what you were working for.
Me?
It's for your revenge...
The perfect weapon for you to use.
What in the world is that?
Mechagodzilla...
Mechagodzilla?
Then you're...
Yes...
We are spacemen from the
Third Planet of the Black Hole.
After Godzilla had defeated
Mechagodzilla the first time...
...we pulled it from the ocean and began rebuilding it.
Doctor...
Let me introduce you to our commander, Mugal.
I've waited for this moment, Dr. Mafune...
What do you think of our science facilities?
This is a tremendous opportunity!
I am pleased that you think so.
Doctor, I have a favor to ask of you...
We would like you to give us the control device that you have invented.
With your Titanosaurus and our Mechagodzilla...
...we would achieve our goals with little opposition.
A prisoner has escaped!
What?! Alright let's go!
It's alright. We will capture him before he reaches any other humans.
Did you really think you could escape? Fire!
Attaching weapons to the sub will slow it down.
Our current sonar's range is about 500 meters.
We can try to expand it to 1 to 1.5 kilometers.
That way, we'll have an advanced warning before the dinosaur gets too close.
Originally, Titanosaurus was not considered an aggressive species.
It would not attack anything on its own.
We found this book while searching the area with Ichinose.
This is Dr. Mafune's notebook.
How about it, Wakayama...
Will one kilometer be enough?
Let me look into it.
Not particularly aggressive?
Oh, thank you.
Sorry for calling you here so urgently.
Well, thank you.
You didn't have to come.
The truth is, we've stumbled on some notes that were written by the Doctor.
Here they are.
I've noticed that the Doctor's and my own views were about the same.
Ichinose...
Please forget everything about the Titanosaurus.
Both the Doctor's and my findings are quite similar.
Who else could come to these conclusions?
But...
Katsura, we are investigating this matter.
Investigating?
Yes, we are preparing a second submarine.
You're going to investigate the dinosaur?
Yes. I was wondering if you would come along as well.
That way we could prove the Doctor's theory together.
Would you like to come along?
Stop, please! I beg of you!
I thought you would be pleased with what I was doing...
Katsura! Come with me!
Katsura, have you forgotten?
I understand what I did.
You shouldn't be saying anything to the humans you've met out there.
Father, Ichinose's and your studies are very similar.
Katsura, will you forget about it?
Your mother did not want you involved in my research.
For your own good, do not follow a single word of it! Our poor and scorned lives...
The pain drove her to her death!
Katsura, we cannot turn back from our course.
That man and his friends are going to investigate it.
This is Yamashita from Shizuoka.
Thank you.
This gentleman wanted to hand over this fragment he found at Mount Amagi.
This is space-titanium.
Analyze it to ensure there is no doubt.
Yes, sir...
But how did he get it?
I was working on the Yamagoya underground water pipe when it happened.
The man pointed at a large scar on his throat and motioned that he could not speak.
He wrote the word "Interpol" on his hand and pushed me back into the access tank.
Moments later, several men chased after him and tried to kill him.
The body looked as if it was mowed down.
Did he die at Amagi?
Begin an immediate investigation!
Yes, sir!
Could he have survived the attack?
We'll know shortly, but he gave
Yamashita the vital clue we needed!
Here.
It's nearly complete, Doctor.
With Mechagodzilla fitted with your control device...
...the greatest robot-monster will be born.
No, it needs one more thing to become a great machine.
It needs living brain cells in order for that to happen.
I see...
Just a moment Doctor... Was an investigation launched to find Titanosaurus?
Katsura knows Titanosaurus better than I ever will.
Then it will be okay?
Commander, do you...?
No, no. Don't mind me.
I'm sure Katsura wouldn't do anything wrong.
The investigation team is leaving today at 1 PM.
Yes, are you going? Why?
Is that so? I understand.
Please wait for me until we return from searching for the dinosaur.
Ah! Hello? Dr. Mafune's...
The investigation team is leaving?
Why won't you come with our investigation team? Why?
He can't go! He's in danger!
Katsura, you must keep your head clear for a little longer.
Decide... You cannot let this get under your skin.
Remember who saved you when you were dying.
I'm finished! Katsura, it's complete! I've completed it!
This is a great achievement!
Please have the honor of activating it.
Alright!
Well, let's throw the switch! Ready?
Yes!
Katsura!
Katsura! Katsura!
Katsura!
What the...? Who are you?!
Your heart is made of wires and gears.
Who would ever love someone like that?
Forget about your human friend.
You should think about this...
You are your father's remaining fountain of strength.
Would you remove such strength?
Revenge and hate...
Yes... Call out Titanosaurus. It must attack the investigation team.
Forget about your search for Titanosaurus!
Internal temperature, 18...
Hey, how's our status?
Ok...
What's wrong? What happened?
The gauge is going wild!
It's like a powerful magnetic force!
Ah, there!
Yes, that's it!
Attack!
It seems to be hurt!
Right! Lets get out of here!
Titanosaurus! Titanosaurus!
Damn earthlings!
The dinosaur slowed down suddenly?
Yes. The dinosaur's attack ended as soon as we contacted the base.
We'd switched on all of our transmitters.
The switch produced many supersonic waves.
Then you think this might be a clue?
Yes.
The sound waves may have had an affect on it.
Boss, we could create a machine that transmits a powerful sound wave.
Alright. Let's propose the countermeasure to headquarters.
You're in an awkward position.
You must be eliminated!
Buddy!
How dare you let the earthlings escape from here!
Execute these pathetic bastards!
Move it!
Father...
What's wrong, Katsura?
It's Titanosaurus...
Titanosaurus? What's wrong with it?
It chased after the submarine when something seemed to hurt it.
What?
What could hurt Titanosaurus?
Next, the sound device. We had a problem with the directional emitter.
We wanted something that could be aimed like a flashlight.
From the parabolic lens, we can concentrate the sound waves into one particular beam.
We can redirect, reinforce and increase its power dramatically.
We encountered a mysterious group that attacked us at Mount Anagi.
They shot at us with weapons that I've never seen before.
Were they spacemen?
I can't be sure of it.
Anyway, should we go on full alert?
Not until we find out their true colors first.
Notify the Self Defense
Force about them.
What do you want with me?
These are my father's research notes.
I found them at my father's house in Kanazawa.
Kanazawa? Did he live in Kanazawa?
I thought they would be a great help to you with your research at the office.
Thank you.
This new data will benefit my research.
Won't you stay for some tea?
Yes.
So, the dinosaur really exists?
Yes it does, just like your father said.
I... I think the dinosaur might be a vicious creature.
I had hoped my father was wrong about his ideas.
It's alright! The dinosaur has a weakness.
It can't stand supersonic waves.
Supersonic?
We're developing a supersonic gun that we'll be able to use soon.
Then we will return to our investigation.
A Supersonic gun?
I'd like to see that...
I'll show them Titanosaurus' true power!
Father...
Are you going to sell out mankind to the spacemen?
Don't you know anything? It will become one of the greatest destroyers of life!
Just like King Ghidorah,
Rodan and Manda!
Do you want Titanosaurus to be a monster just like them?
Katsura...
I'm not only sending Titanosaurus out just for Mugal's purpose...
I'm not bowing down to the spacemen!
Mechagodzilla is not the enemy of Titanosaurus.
I want to prove to them all that I was right!
I want to show those useless fools at the academic society!
I want them to see the proof that I was right!
Go... Titanosaurus!
That's it. Let's install it.
Right!
Units One and Two are ready to attack!
- Right!
This is horrible!
- It's pretty bad!
The wiring! The wiring is cut!
Damn!
Who could have done this?
Well, get this fixed as quickly as possible!
Yes, sir!
Wakayama!
Titanosaurus has just come ashore!
Murakoshi, it happened!
Someone sabotaged the supersonic gun!
What? The supersonic gun?
Damn! Wakayama...
Without that, we have no way to stop it!
You look over there!
- Yes, sir!
The Doctor has unleashed Titanosaurus without waiting for his instructions!
I know...
Should we send a team to stop him?
This could affect our plans!
No, wait...
Look at this...
A super giger-counter!
Who is Mechagodzilla's greatest enemy?
Godzilla.
Correct... Look!
Godzilla is heading straight for Titanosaurus now.
He will fight Titanosaurus and defeat him...
...but Godzilla won't have time to regain his strength.
This time, in a single stroke, we will attack Tokyo.
This is Mechagodzilla's revenge!
Prefect Ural wards 3 and 4, please report to your ground shelters immediately!
Father!
Katsura! Katsura!
Katsura went to find those notes just for me!
Maybe, but she was the only one besides us who knew about the supersonic gun.
If you knew that, then why don't you suspect me of the same thing?!
Katsura wasn't that type of person!
Ichinose!
Forget about it, she's dead now.
I still believe in her. What else is there to say to you?
Ichinose!
Yamamoto!
Yamamoto, you've done what you could.
Leave him alone for now...
Why didn't you wait for my instructions?
It's alright...
Now you know that we both have a common enemy.
Doctor... From now on you will follow our orders in our battle.
Alright?
This is the second time you saved my daughter's life...
I will do whatever you ask.
Will you be able to repair the equipment?
Yes, I can. But it will take two days.
Two days?
This is the first lookout point and here is the second lookout point.
Please keep someone posted at the lookouts while we evacuate the civilians.
But we still won't have any weapon capable of defeating Titanosaurus...
Please do what you can, quickly.
Wakayama, I beg of you.
Finish this in one day.
But, Boss...
No! One day! I can have anything you need here within an hour.
Boss... Can I go to Amagi?
What for?
This time, it's their base!
Alright. I understand.
Doctor... Mechagodzilla's control center is linked to Katsura.
When the earthmen finally find this base...
I'll destroy it and remove the problem.
I have arranged for it to explode as soon as Mechagodzilla leaves the base.
From then on, Katsura will be
Mechagodzilla's control center.
Not even Interpol will be able to find it.
Doctor... You told me that in your opinion...
...Mechagodzilla would be ineffective without living brain cells.
Now, Katsura's brain cells and
Mechagodzilla's mechanics are linked...
...creating a powerful cyborg.
Katsura's hate will turn Mechagodzilla's hate into a powerful explosive force.
Doctor...
When this fight is over, you will be able to live your life with your daughter.
We will build you the first building in a new Tokyo, over the ashes of the old city.
Katsura!
Forgive me, Katsura.
Forgive me...
Katsura...
I'll complete the Doctor's research for you. I will...
Katsura?!
Katsura, is that you?
And you are... the one looking for Titanosaurus?
Who are you?
Mafune...
Dr. Mafune?!
You bastards! Let me go!
If you sit still, you can witness the inevitable destruction of your city.
Bastards, What are you doing?!
We are saviors...
We will remove the weak humans from this fouled earth and replace them with saviors.
Doctor!
How could you?!
I believed in your work!
Think of your pride!
It's too late for anything.
It's out of my hands!
Doctor!
Prepare to attack.
Well, Katsura...
Call Mechagodzilla...
Katsura!
We're too late! Damn! Wait!
Help us! Help us!
It's no use! Get back!
Hey, old man!
What's going on?!
An explosion? Alright, get out of here, hurry!
Let's go!
Katsura, call Titanosaurus!
At this moment, the spacemen-controlled
Titanosaurus and Mechagodzilla...
... are invading the heart of the city!
Go Mechagodzilla and Titanosaurus!
Destroy the earthlings!
Those are rotation missiles.
Mechagodzilla has new weapons.
Incredible! Where is Godzilla?
Stop! Stop, Gen!
It's dangerous!
No, it's alright!
I'll go on by myself!
Okay, I'm going too.
Help us!
- Godzilla help us!
Isn't it done yet?!
I'm connecting the circuits!
We're leaving.
- Good luck!
There's nothing wrong.
Good.
Yes, that's it!
Dr. Mafune completed his invention.
That's why Titanosaurus isn't gentle...
Base! Base! This is Murakoshi!
I'm heading for Munazuru.
Send troops to Dr. Mafune's home!
That's it Titanosaurus! Stomp your foe Godzilla beneath your feet!
Katsura...
Katsura, you're not yourself.
Be silent...
Look there!
Ready to fire!
Fire!
Fight!
Fight, Titanosaurus!
What's wrong?!
Doctor!
Mechagodzilla, a little more!
Commander!
What's wrong?
The Defense Force is approaching this area!
What?
Mechagodzilla!
Damn!
Titanosaurus...
Fight, Titanosaurus!
Katsura!
You are mistaken.
Katsura, you can't!
You are mistaken!
You're not who I think you are?
No...
I'm not the human you think I am.
Katsura!
Don't move!
Ichinose, are you okay?!
Katsura...
Katsura...
Katsura!
Doctor!
Katsura!
Father!
Father!
Don't move!
It's alright. It's alright.
Even though you are a cyborg, I still love you.
It's not your fault...
It's not your fault!
You... You are a human.
You'd never lose the heart of a human being!
I beg you... Please kill me!
The mechanism that controls
Mechagodzilla is inside of me!
But... if I were... to be killed...
Idiot! I won't do it!
I won't do it... I won't do it!
Katsura!
Katsura...
Well fire!
Do you think your bullets have a chance of killing the great Mugal?
Fire!
We did it!
We did it!
We've done it!
THE FANTASTIC PLANET
She stopped moving.
Now we can't play with her any more.
Careful! It's Mr. Sihn.
Look, father.
A female Om and her baby.
Is she dead?
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.
Why does the baby make noise?
It's either frightened or hungry.
We can't leave him.
May I keep him?
Let me, father.
I'll take care of him.
All right, Tiwa, we can't let the animal die.
He was the Great Master of the Traag people.
He saved my life and took me into his home.
Mother!
Mother!
See how cute the little Om is!
His mother's dead.
I want to keep him.
He is very pretty, Tiwa.
You disturbed your mother's Meditation!
Make that animal behave or I'll take it away!
Father, he got away.
He needs a collar.
Learn to use the Watch.
Now put the animal down.
It's fun. Let me try.
No so fast.
The animal is delicate.
You might hurt it.
Did you name it?
Tiwa, like me.
That's not an Om's name.
Name it Frisky or Trusty.
Watch him wiggle, the little devil!
I'll name him Terr.
I was forgotten!
A baby Om is nothing compared to Meditation!
A weird virtual.
Traags devoted most of their time to it.
It seemed to be chief concern.
Oddly enough, the housing unit factory on our Uva at Goham... has not met production levels.
The machines show unusual wear...
This wear causes the delay.
Master Taj, can you explain?
We don't know yet.
Meanwhile we’ll use machines from our reserve... to meet the schedule.
I don't understand.
The machines worked perfectly until now.
Have you had similar problems on other Uvas?
Only machines from our space flight... to planet Antax 4 have trouble completing their program.
Master Sihn, our scientists... explain this loss as a break in the sensory compensation system.
Scientists also notice that animals brought from planet Terra... have sovibon and rather high intelligence.
I am not sure that is true.
Obviously, the animal adapts rather well.
But is that intelligence?
The little pet you stroke... between Meditations may well... surprise you some day.
Films made in Terra show many traces of organized life.
This ability to adapt, Master Kon may indicate advanced evolution.
Oms have a much shorter life span that we.
But we must not forget that they multiply much more rapidly.
If the animal is intelligent,
Master Sihn... we have not yet noticed.
What we do notice is the considerable damage... caused by Oms on the Uvas of Jext and Telez.
The numbers of tame Oms is easy to control.
But wild Oms probably exist... in much larger numbers than most of us realize.
We de-om the enclaves... of wild Oms every 3 cycles.
But I wonder if... that is often enough.
Few weapons have a long-term effect.
Drastic measures must be taken.
New ways to fight them are being researched.
I doubt if they will suffice.
Go play somewhere else.
I'm very sorry.
Imagination was so rich today too...
That Om is a pest!
Please, our children all love those animals.
I grew up fast in that slow world.
A Traag week was equal to one of my years.
I was only a live plaything.
I was sometimes rebellious.
Tiwa loved me.
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!
Tiwa got her learning from a headphone.
Its lessons cut directly into the brain... engraved on the memory forever.
"Our Planet Ygam has one satellite...
"the Fantastic Planet.
It is uninhabited
"and used for Meditation.
"Ygam is divided into several Uvas.
"Uvas Strop and Yot are natural and symmetrical.
"Urtana, the largest Uva, is covered
"with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range...
"is from 8 to 243 laics...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible...
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea...
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laics.
"Fixations bloc offset pontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure.
"All Uvas under go a cycle of 3 seasons of unequal length.
"The seasons of garus crystalization..."
An accident enabled me to acquire the Traags knowledge.
"When the soil peels, intense vegetation..."
"replaces all nosks with similar nosks."
I liked the lessons.
I tried to get the most out of them.
"The cliffs on the fepular sea are eroded...
"by rains that often last long."
Tiwa, bring your animal!
Jurgal has his and we'll have some fun.
I don't want him hurt.
Jurgal's animal is insane!
Once, he almost tore off his ears!
He won't damage your Om.
Come and play!
Come and see!
Let Terr fight, it will be more fun.
Terr will win, he's a real demon!
Now fight!
He sings well.
Terr can sing too.
Sing, Terr. Go on!
- He'll strangle him!
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
What a mean animal!
"It is simple to see a tark's fladed muscles...
"because the animal's easily skinned..."
Do you hear the Om?
That's Tiwa's lesson!
She loves Terr so much that he is with her always.
Can he understand what he says?
I don't think so.
Anyway, I'll forbid her to keep Terr during infos.
She must study seriously.
"The liscinian muscle of a trak's leg...
"is a fleshy, fuliform vilok...
"The molog is an enviparous animal...
"It has more than half a billion lucons.
"The entire surface of their walls...
"is made up of little cells...
"separated by leaves of thin organure."
"Some scientists...
"today believe it is not organure but only gambous amalga...
" an artificial structure... "
Have you got Terr again during you info?
I told you to stop!
Into the Omhouse!
But father, he doesn't bother me...
And he's so happy.
The infos are for you!
Get back to work!
It was time for the Traag children to have their first Meditation...
The initiation ceremony was a major step... on their road to knowledge.
After a while
I lost my intimacy with Tiwa.
As she grew up, she gave up her playthings.
Deprived of lessons,
I decided to run away.
Mother, I can't find Terr.
And my headphones are gone.
Use your bracelet!
If he's far away, it'll hurt him.
Put your bracelet on maximum, please.
No, mother...
You're pretty stupid.
Like all tame Oms!
You have a collar too.
It’s a fake, to fool the Traags.
What's that?
The Traags invented it.
What?
The Traags made it.
Listen!
"Valio, cycle, info 4...
"You will observe that Aklon research...
"in solid pernetrope...
"works the same as in plane pernetrope.
"Notice that we look for festation groups..."
Don't worry, it's not dangerous.
Where are you taking it?
- I don't know.
- Come with me!
My new friend took me to her people who lived hidden in the Big Tree. deep in an abandoned park.
As a silly tame Om, my first meeting with wild Oms was a failure.
Don't touch that case, it's a trap!
Since I brought the headphones of knowledge... the wizard opposed me at once!
We've brought 5 cases, Chief.
What? Is that all?
One of them was a trap and Speed is dead.
He knew it was a trap.
He's a tame Om.
He ran away with a Traag device.
It taught him to read Traag writing.
He knows what's in the cases?
In that one?
Color powder.
"Urtana is covered with blue assonic blocks.
"Its temperature range is from 8 to 243 laiks...
"making ripocal exploitation impossible.
"Our Uva, Goham, has a fepular inland sea
"stabilizing the apenosh at about 20 laiks.
"Fixations blocks...
"offset ontic rebation.
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure..."
Why interrupt the info?
Traag knowledge is bad.
We don't need it.
We are not tame Oms.
It is great offense!
You must battle according to the Law.
Bring the combat animals!
You win. Stay with us Oms of the Big Tree.
You can be of use to us.
Tomorrow we go on an expedition.
It was my first expedition to steal Traag food.
We brought a great deal back.
Be brave, the Big Tree isn't far.
The Hollow-Bush bandits!
Look out!
Why attack us?
They're from the Hollow Bush.
Beware of them.
They are thieves from the other side of the park.
The Great Zarek
3000 cycles before Krowp...
"created the pyramidic civilization.
"From his tomb - they say he still animates...
"the ball of Life.
"Projectiles pierce him but he does not change.
"His mind travels through Ygam's skies...
"regularly ever since he led the Traags...
"to victory against the Jankos.
"This may well be how Meditation originated.
"Some believe that Zarek is immortal and...
"that from the flames of time he reappears in infinitely varied...
"whirling reality...
"to combat the Traags will to die.
"Actually
"driving out the Jankos made...
"the Traags develop a spirit of enterprise..."
The Oms are learning if only we had more headphones.
You know as much as the Traags.
I am barely learning to write.
Look.
Are you sure?
Did you read it right?
All the park walls read "de-om"!
What does it mean?
The Traags want to kill all the Oms!
Long ago...
I saw them de-om the park.
It was horrible!
But now on our tree, there's not much danger.
What will we do?
- It had to come.
- Anyway, we have time to prepare.
We'll post sentries.
They'll slaughter us... to punish us for stealing knowledge.
Let us pray to the Fantastic Planet.
Sentries will warn us when they come.
Tomorrow we shall see.
What are you doing on our land?
I came to warn you.
The Traags intend to de-om the park.
De-om!
You don't say!
How do you know?
One of us read it on the wall!
Can Big-Tree Oms read Traag writing now?
Don't listen to him!
It's a trap to get us out of the Hollow Bush!
Believe me, the Traags will de-om!
Take him away!
Someone go look at the walls!
Listen!
- Traags!
- Quiet!
I smell Oms here.
That vermin!
The Masters should... de-om more often!
It's not bad to have pet Oms...
They're fun.
But all those wild Oms...
They steal.
They're dirty and multiply appallingly fast.
Look...
A nest by the walk.
See... A whole colony.
Let's kill Them.
Chief is dead.
Stop weeping like children.
We must go where the Traags can't find us.
I know a place,
I'll take you there.
This road leads to an abandoned rocket dump.
We'll be safe there.
I regret that we de-om only every 3 cycles!
This killing proves it is not enough!
A Traag murdered!
It's unbelievable!
Are we so weak that Oms can kill us... so easily?
Wild Oms are much more numerous than we thought.
The body showed many... bites and wounds, said Traag who managed to escape slaughter.
Oms' bites were very numerous.
Every day wild Oms become bolder!
They multiply at a terrifying rate!
Master Sihn, it is disturbing to note that your Uva at Telez is not the only one that has been very difficult to de-om.
Two other Uvas...
Goham and Urtana... have had similar problems...
Near the murdered Traag we found... two surprisingly well organized lairs.
Most disturbing of all was... that in one of the lairs... cases were sorted according to contents.
But they were unopened.
How could the Oms know what they contained?
It is high time to take efficient measures!
I suggest we de-om twice a cycle.
I also request strict regulation of breeding... and selling of tame Oms.
Too often they turn wild again... and go join the throngs of Oms... living in parks and other isolated areas.
We must use the new, much-discussed de-om-ing devices at last.
We must exterminate all wild Oms.
And I ask you:
Should we keep our tame Oms?
We are wrong to believe Oms are merely vicious animals.
If we do, we may commit... an error of serious consequences.
Ygam had..
3 seasons equal to...
15 of our years.
The Traag rocket graveyard was abandoned.
There we built our city.
We planned to go to the Fantastic Planet.
Many tame and wild Oms came to join us.
Knowledge acquired from the headphones... enabled us to reduce...
Traag rockets... to our size.
"Trinur is a metal that palsifies Matwar
"top-grade reculid gives it a remarkable metallic shine."
We have succeeded, Terr.
Two rockets are for testing.
We will start with those.
- It's only a matter of work and time.
- We must hurry!
Om informers say... that a large-scale de-om-ing is near!
They may know where we are.
We must send up our two rockets at once... to see if we can live on the Fantastic Planet.
We cannot wait any longer!
Too bad. I can't go with you.
I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
I know you will build... a new world where Oms can be happy... far away from the Traags.
The Fantastic Planet will be our planet... a world for our children.
You must go!
You must hurry!
You must...
We had discovered the secret of the Traags.
The Spheres of Meditation there enabled Traags to meet... beings from other galaxies and hold strange nuptial rites.
This union gave them vital energy which they needed... and enabled them to reproduce.
We were afraid...
The statues feet might damage our rockets.
We found the only weak point of the Traags.
On Ygam, the de-om-ing was halted.
Never have the Traags been in such great danger!
Our entire civilization is threatened!
The Oms are taking revenge.
They have incredible scientific knowledge.
They must be stopped!
It may be too late.
Neither Oms nor Traags... will profit from destruction.
We must try to make peace.
"Since the Sihn era,
"the Traag civilization has undergone a remarkable evolution.
"The Oms, instructed by our philosophy and...
"technology...
"now provide the Traags with...
"dynamics and a new way of thinking.
Our planet now has two satellites, one natural and one artificial.
"The natural one, the Fantastic Planet...
"is kept for Traag Meditation.
"The artificial one was made by Oms.
They named it Terr.
"Oms live in huge cities on the various Uvas."
Mind your step, Jenny.
Don't you worry none about me.
I can hold me gin.
I'm right as rain.
Ta-ta, love.
Mind how you go.
- Evening.
- Good evening.
- Iùs a raw night, isn't it?
- Yes. Raw.
- You'll ruin them fine clothes.
- Would you like this?
Come straight to the point, don't you, love?
Well, my place is right along here.
No.
There.
We are in a hurry, aren't we?
Come on, then.
Come along.
Oh, right you are, sir.
Wouldn't want to break it.
Wow. Thaùs lovely.
We got our own band.
Come on, then.
I'm hot and getting colder, if you take my meaning.
- Whaùs your name, dearie?
- John.
John.
John.
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
John.
John.
But my friends all call me Jack.
Will The Gazette continue with your pieces on free love, H. G?
Free love sells newspapers.
Gentleman, the Fleet Street Casanova.
Here, here.
I've got my little experiments to pay for.
You're the hero of the working class.
Free love is all they can afford.
Oh, Lord.
Don't start him on socialism.
We'll have to listen to a sermon on it.
Don't call it a sermon. You know
I don't believe in organized religion.
Socialism is the path man must tread on the way to a utopian society.
We've heard all that. Whaùs this great announcement we're here for?
- A cure for gravity?
- I want to wait until we're all here.
Who's missing?
- Dr. Stevenson is here.
- Thank you. Send him in.
- Good evening, John.
- Herbert.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
We'd begun to despair. Have you dined?
There's still roast beef.
Thank you, no. Perhaps a little brandy to take away the chill.
I'm sorry I missed supper, but a physician's hours are not his own.
- Gentlemen.
- Good health.
Cheers.
What has Herbert left for me tonight?
Chess must wait.
You're just in time for the surprise.
Isn't he, H. G?
The great big whatever-it-is?
- Am I?
- I was waiting for you.
- I am all attention.
- Very well.
Gentlemen, I have called you here tonight to bid you farewell.
- Farewell?
- Where are you going?
- Another holiday in Scotland?
- No. No, I am traveling...
...but I'm not leaving London.
I don't expect to leave my laboratory.
- Riddles again.
- Gentlemen.
I am talking about traveling through time.
In a machine constructed for that very purpose.
What?
- Poppycock.
- Why?
Electric light, courtesy of Edison, a modern Prometheus.
Good heavens. You were really serious.
I don't believe it. You've actually built the bloody thing.
- Free love paid for most of it.
- I've no doubt.
I didn't think practical jokes was in your line.
Twelve years ago, an engineer used the sun to power a printing press.
My time machine uses the same power source.
- You can't be serious.
- This thing is propelled by sunshine?
This cup catches the rays of the sun...
...converting its heat to electricity here.
Electricity does the rest. Juxtaposing fields of energy creating friction.
The result is an ever-increasing series of reactions...
...that literally rotates the machine out of one time sphere into another.
Cruising speed is two years per minute. Go into the past or future.
Two years per minute?
Acceleration keeps the machine and occupant outside all time spheres...
...conscious, but vaporized.
- How do you determine direction?
West, you gain yesterdays.
East, you accumulate tomorrows.
Balderdash!
Go north, you get to Glasgow.
The machine is designed with several safety features.
The reversal rotation lock returns the machine to its starting date...
...after the completion of a voyage.
If the occupant is injured during a flight...
...the passenger is returned to the point of departure.
Unless he uses this key to countermand the device.
Without that key, iùs a bloody homing pigeon.
And what, may I ask, is this?
Well, John...
...this is the vaporizing equalizer.
Without it, the passenger journeys without the machine...
...and without the machine, there is no coming back.
Well, H.G., which is it to be?
The past or the future?
The past, surely.
He'll want to meet Cleopatra.
- The future.
- Why the future?
I belong there. In three generations, social utopia will have come to pass.
There'll be no war, crime or poverty.
And no disease either, John.
Men will live like brothers, and in equality with women.
- Oh, dear. Leùs have the past.
- Here, here.
I can't agree with you. Check.
You astonish me. In the midst of all your theorizing, you ignore the facts.
We live in a cosmic charnel house.
Mankind has not changed in 2000 years.
We hunt, we're hunted. Thaùs how it is. How it will always be.
The future will prove you wrong.
The future will tell.
Anyway, I have just one question for myself. When do you leave?
- I'm not sure.
- Human frailty, at last.
Well, to be quite candid...
...I haven't worked up the nerve.
- First time for that.
But I will. All I have to do is set the date and activate the switches.
And I'll inherit the Hope diamond.
- Checkmate.
- How does he do it?
- Not again?
- Every time.
I know how he thinks. Thaùs all.
- One day I shall win.
- When you learn how I think.
Sorry to interrupt. Two gentlemen from
Scotland Yard want a word with you.
What is the meaning of this?
Beg pardon, sir.
Might we have a word with you?
- The Ripper? In this vicinity?
- I'm afraid so, sir.
We've cordoned off the neighborhood.
We're asking for cooperation.
Will that be all right? Your housekeeper will sleep better.
- By all means.
- Thank you, sir.
Whaùs happened?
Apparently, the Ripper has struck again.
- With your permission, sir.
- Please.
- He's not been heard from in years.
- Nor in this area.
No doubt about it, I'm afraid.
He has a very distinctive style.
- What have you there?
- You better look at this, sir.
- Thaùs Dr. Stevenson's bag.
- That belongs to one of my guests.
- Whaùs his name?
- John Leslie Stevenson.
- Chief surgeon at St. Bartholomew's...
- Also chief surgeon in Whitechapel.
- Nothing upstairs.
- All windows locked.
- Skylight?
- Closed.
- Checked the roof. No sign.
- In back?
A high brick wall.
He's not gone that way.
- He was with you just now?
- Yes.
He must have gone out the front, as we came in.
It doesn't matter. We know who he is, which is more than before tonight.
We'll round him up. If you come with me, I'll see that you get home safe.
- There's bound to be an explanation.
- Beyond belief.
Thank you, dear. Thaùs my umbrella.
I've never been so frightened. All the times I've put that bag in the closet.
- I wonder he didn't take it with him.
- We'd never have known.
- He was always such a gentleman.
- Yes. A gentleman.
I wonder where he got to so fast.
The coppers searched high and low.
We were by the door the whole time.
If he fooled them this long, no surprise he's done it again.
- What did you say?
- We were by the door the whole time.
When you learn how I think.
What have I done?
I've turned that bloody maniac loose upon utopia.
- Mr. Wells...
- Bring me all the housekeeping money.
And any money you have of your own.
I'll make it up to you.
- How much?
- Fifteen pounds, sixpence.
- You want it all?
- All, if you please, Mrs. Turner.
- Something wrong, sir?
- Would you mind awfully?
Money may not answer.
I may have to trade with the natives.
Let me see. The key.
86 years. Two years per minute.
That makes 43 minutes.
Estimated time of arrival would be...
Right.
Utopia.
Mr. Wells?
Mr. Wells?
Lindbergh's over the Irish coast... support of the woman I love... we have to fear is... their finest hour... attacked Pearl Harbor...
I shall return... this is London... whose throat you'd like to cut... proclaim the state of Israel...
Queen Elizabeth II is crowned... from North Korea...
Ask not...
President Kennedy is dead...
Martin Luther King... one small step for man... lsraeli athletes were killed...
Vietnam cease-fire agreement... because of Watergate... second test-tube baby...
Pope John Paul's successor... and executed four generals...
Mommy, look at that.
Mommy, come over here.
Mommy. Who's that man?
Jason, come away.
He probably works here.
The Wells exhibit is on loan from the British Muzeum.
The objects in this hall form a portrait of the public...
...and private life of an extraordinary person...
...whose prophetic vision influenced the shape of things to come.
On your left is the inlaid wood secretary with a unique top...
...from Wells' rooms.
It was on this desk...
Hey! Get away from the exhibit.
Where do you think you are,
Disneyland?
- Pardon?
- You heard me. Get behind those ropes.
- Was discovered by workmen digging where Wells' house once stood.
Come on.
The reasons for his building it are unknown.
- That it didn't work made him avoid discussing it.
- H.G. Wells was born in...
- Novel? Time Machine?
You people. Christ, Almighty.
Never.
Eight hours off.
What did you do to my car?
Can't you drive?
Some SOB can't read.
- Could you tell me what city this is?
- Oh, come on.
Could you please tell me what city this?
San Francisco?
California. Of course!
Eight hours difference.
Thirteen, 14, 15 pounds. This money is quite old, you're aware of that.
- They're still good, aren't they?
- Sure.
A coin dealer would give you more.
Here, all you'll get is the current exchange rate, which is...
- Twenty-five dollars?
- Really, iùs the same all over.
Money makes the world go round.
Iùs just worth less and less.
Money, yes.
Everyone needs money.
Has there been another gentlemen here recently...
...another Englishman with currency like mine?
Not that I recall.
And they would have sent him to me.
I see.
Get me a Big Mac, an order of fries and a small Coke to go, please.
Thank you, dear.
Get me a Big Mac, fries and tea to go, please.
Pommes frites.
Fries are pommes frites.
I never saw wood like this before.
I haven't seen stones in settings like these since before the war.
- The war?
- Since the Second World War. You know.
- Did you say, "world war"?
- Since World War II, I said.
- How much are they worth?
- Today's market? $6000 easy.
- Would you like to buy them?
- I couldn't give you top dollar.
Thaùs all right. Whaùs your offer?
- Four?
- Yes. Very well.
You don't want to think about it?
Okay. May I see some ID?
You know. Driver's license, credit card, something like that.
- I'm afraid I don't have some.
- I can't do business without some ID.
- How do I know these aren't hot?
- Hot?
- Stolen.
- Stolen?
I assure you, I give you my word as a gentleman.
Come on, whaùs this gentleman stuff?
How come you don't got any ID?
Let me do a computer check. If iùs clear, you'll have a check in a week.
I don't have a week.
I don't believe you exist.
But if you do, I need your help.
Just let me stay the night...
...and I'll be on my way in the morning. I won't trouble you again.
I'm sorry. We're closing now.
Utopia.
There you are, sir.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the foreign currency officer.
- You're looking at him.
- You?
Surely there must be a gentleman?
Don't be a chauvinist. Iùs taken me three years to get here.
Don't you believe in women's liberation?
Women's liberation.
I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect.
In fact, I was all for it, so I shouldn't complain.
You were all for it?
What changed your mind?
Nothing.
I don't know whether you can help me.
- May I help you?
- Thank you.
I'm certainly willing for you to try.
I'm looking for an Englishman who may have tried to exchange money.
I'll say.
Then he was here?
Yesterday, big as life.
With a money belt that was bigger.
Musùve weighed a ton. A friend?
We were traveling together, and now I've lost him.
- His name was John Leslie Stevenson.
- Thaùs him.
I wanted him to open an account but he only cashed a few hundred dollars.
You wouldn't happen to know whaùs become of him?
He asked me to recommend a hotel.
- An hotel?
- I sent him to the Hyatt Regency.
- Hyatt Regency?
- Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
You here on a visit?
Tourist type thing?
If you don't know anyone, let me show you around.
We San Franciscans are pretty proud of this old town.
Well...
...yes, perhaps that might be nice.
Iùs your option. You've got the card.
Give me a ring. My name's Amy.
- A ring?
- You know:
My number's on the card.
- Whaùs your name?
- Herbert...
...Wells.
What was that?
That was a very cute man.
That was a pickup.
- Against bank rules.
- I don't care.
At least he's not gay.
Plus, I love the way he talks.
How about that suit? Early American.
He'll be back.
- Whaùs up, doc?
- Pardon?
Where to?
Could you take me, as quickly as possible, to the Hyatt...?
- Who is it?
- Your breakfast, sir.
- Bless my soul.
- May I come in?
Certainly, certainly.
You were literally the last person on earth I expected to see.
There was no way to prevent the machine's return. I lack the key.
- No.
- You do manage to find the nerve...
...after I tested your machine for you.
How did you manage to track me down?
That was brilliant.
We'll add detective to your list of accomplishments.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
I'm not here to engage in idle banter, Stevenson.
You've used me and my machine to escape justice.
I must congratulate you on the device.
At dinner the other century,
I thought you'd lost your wits.
Fate intervened, and I ascertained that you are a Columbus of a new age.
The dawn of time travel.
I salute you.
- Come with me.
- Of course. Where are we going?
To the muzeum.
I'm obliged to take you back to face the consequences of your acts.
You can't be serious.
You're so Victorian.
How do I get back? By force?
Be reasonable, John.
We don't belong here.
- We violated...
- We don't belong here?
Let me show you something.
Sit down.
Come on, I won't bite. Sit.
Now, look...
Terrorists carried out their threat and began shooting...
...the first five of 106 Israeli schoolchildren held hostage...
You haven't gone forward, Herbert.
You've gone back.
We've just received word that
Mayor Margolin of Columbus was shot.
We don't belong here.
On the contrary...
...I belong here completely and utterly.
I'm home.
Iùs you who do not belong here.
You, with your absurd notions of a perfect and harmonious society. Drivel.
The world has caught up and surpassed me.
Ninety years ago, I was a freak.
Today, I'm an amateur.
You go back. The future isn't what you thought. Iùs what I am.
Do you know that you can purchase a rifle? Iùs legal.
- These people encourage...
- Stop it!
Iùs catching, isn't it?
Violence.
You finding me is rather fortuitous.
For me, that is.
Otherwise, I'd be obliged to search for you.
Are you going to give it to me?
- I have no idea what you mean.
- Of course you do.
I'm talking about the key.
I can't have you following me for eternity, like the Flying Dutchman.
Give me the key and we'll be quits.
IKey? I don't have it with me.
I've played countless games of chess with you...
...and the one thing you cannot do is bluff.
I want that key.
Oh, God.
Maid.
SeÚor.
Stevenson.
Is he okay?
I beg your pardon.
Just a moment, please.
Yes?
I'm looking for a patient recently admitted.
- Name?
- John Leslie Stevenson.
- Not here.
- They told me he'd be here.
- This is San Francisco Hospital?
- Not here under that name. Next.
- He just arrived. A motorcar hit him.
- A motorcar?
- Pardon?
- A car.
Yes, a car.
He's a tall, flaxen-haired, distinguished-looking Englishman.
Just a minute, please.
Sorry. An accident victim matching your description died 20 minutes ago.
- We had him listed as John Doe.
- Died?
Lmpossible. I saw him sitting up after the accident.
His chart says, "internal injuries."
It happens that way sometimes.
Wait. May I see the body?
Are you family? Are you a relative?
- He doesn't have any relatives.
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute, please.
- Excuse me.
O- R-A-J.
Gloriosky.
- Oh.
- Hello.
You'll let me take you to lunch.
Hello. What did you say?
I said, lunch on me.
What do you say?
Oh, well...
Just let me get my things.
That is what you had in mind?
- Certainly, if you like.
- Wait right there.
All set. Where to?
Well, iùs your city.
I'll leave it up to you.
I know, something with a view.
Don't worry, iùs safe. We haven't had any trouble since the big one in 1906.
Big one?
The earthquake. Don't you know?
You haven't done your reading.
- It leveled the whole shebang.
- The shebang?
I see.
Delicious. Far superior to that
Scottish place where I breakfasted.
- Scottish?
- MacDougall's.
- What about your friend?
- Friend?
Dr. Stevenson.
He wasn't exactly my friend.
We had a falling out.
I won't be seeing him again.
I like that suit. Is that what they're wearing in London?
It was when I left.
Are you from London? Everyone
I meet from England is from London.
Sorry, what were you saying?
I was asking if you're from London.
I have some friends there.
I thought you might know them.
I realize iùs a big city.
Anyway, their name is Phillips.
He works for Coca-Cola. Any chance?
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Ah, yes.
You probably move in different circles.
Are you a scientist or something?
Whatever makes you say that?
Just a hunch.
You give me the impression of someone who's cloistered away...
...in a library, doing research and never reads the newspaper.
I used to write for a newspaper.
The Pall Mall Gazette.
Really? Shows how much I know.
You're a reporter?
I wrote articles on whatever struck my fancy. Social issues, mainly.
The last thing I did was a series on free love.
Free love?
I haven't heard that term since the eighth grade.
Tell me something.
Did you think it was forward of me to invite you to lunch like this?
- Do you often...?
- Invite strange men to lunch? No.
But iùs not often that a strange man turns me on.
Or a strange woman.
I didn't mean to imply I was a dyke.
- A dyke?
- Sorry, lesbian.
I like my sex straight.
Iùs just that I go for months without meeting anybody who does it for me.
A lot of people, like my friend Carol...
I won't gossip, but a lot of people can sleep around.
Not me. I really have to like the guy.
Otherwise, iùs just no go.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't say that right off the bat.
Iùs not Women's Lib.
I just get nervous.
When I get nervous,
I tend to babble.
- Do I make you nervous?
- Yes.
- You do, sort of.
- Why?
Because I like you.
You ought to see the Golden Gate.
Whaùs that?
You're kidding.
How'd you decide to come here?
Stick a pin in a map or something?
- The Golden Gate.
- The Golden Gate.
- Want to drive across it?
- Oh, is it for motorcars?
R stands for "reverse," and D stands for "drive."
The right pedal causes us to accelerate while the left retards our speed.
Of course. Honestly, Herbert, you act like you've never been in a car before.
Nonsense, I was in one this morning.
You've a very good driver.
Damn straight. My husband used to drive in stock car rallies.
He taught me good.
- What are you thinking about?
- A brave new world with such people.
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.
You mentioned your husband.
My ex. Yeah, I was married for a while, when I was very young.
We met during an antiwar demonstration.
- The Second World War.
- What? How old do you think I am?
Oh, I'm sorry. The Third World War?
The Vietnam War.
Vietnam.
Iùs just that he wanted me to give up work and have children.
The housewife routine.
Not for me.
He never took my ambitions seriously.
What about you? You married?
I wouldn't be here if I were.
Well, thaùs nice.
A lot of guys...
Iùs no big deal.
I like that.
I'm also divorced, for similar reasons.
- She wanted you to be a housewife?
- She wanted me to be routine.
Well, that is one thing you definitely are not.
First I thought it was your voice or your clothes.
Now, I don't know.
Maybe iùs that "little boy lost" quality you give off.
- Brings out my maternal instincts.
- You're very perceptive.
Lost is what I am.
No.
Herbert.
Iùs only a movie.
I hate all that violence.
Did you ever see Red Shoes?
I really got off on that.
Careers.
Iùs 6:00.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I haven't made any.
- Are you tired of me yet?
- No, not in the least.
Great.
How about I cook you dinner?
I don't live very far from here.
- Iùs not too much trouble?
- I'm half Italian. I love to cook.
- What about the other half?
- Norwegian. Norwegians love to eat.
What on earth is that?
Isn't it incredible? They built it for the Pan-American Expo of 1914.
Somehow, iùs still standing.
I love living next to it.
Come on, I'll give you the cook's tour.
I bet you don't have anything like this in London.
- You've never seen the Albert Hall.
- I've never even been to London.
- Where do you live?
- This way.
You should see it when they turn the lights on.
- Is it marble?
- Would you believe plaster?
What on earth is Cosmopolitan?
Where are all your books?
I don't have all that many.
I don't seem to read much anymore.
Even when I have the time, iùs easier to watch TV...
...even though thaùs mainly crap.
Whaùs that?
The phone.
TeÔs idea.
Hello? Oh, hi.
Iùs my friend Carol, from the bank, checking up on you.
Yeah.
No.
Who knows?
Carol, I'm trying, so will you please let me get on with it?
I have to go now. Bye.
Carol says hi.
She asked if London is really crawling with Arabs.
- Arabs?
- She wants to marry into oil.
This is almost ready.
I'm going to change.
I've been in my work clothes all day.
Please, you go right ahead.
You look very beautiful.
Herbert, if you don't take me into your arms this minute...
...l'll scream.
Well, hello there.
Hello.
Why, Miss Jones, you're gorgeous.
- What?
- You don't close your eyes.
Well, neither do you.
These are the funniest buttons
I ever saw.
Iùs like it was some kind of costume.
Oh, my gosh.
Is the rest of this outfit as interesting?
Amy. Amy.
I don't want to compromise you.
Are you certain I'm not forcing you...?
Forcing me? My God, Herbert,
I'm practically raping you.
Yeah, thaùs true.
Here.
All naked, all right here.
The hottest, wildest, sexiest ladies in San Francisco.
Come on and check it out.
This is the one.
This is where iùs happening.
Come on in, buddy.
If you're old enough, you're bold enough.
Come here, come here.
Let me show you.
Third largest in the West.
The weather should be sunny.
Iùs a nippy 51 degrees, going up to 68...
...then dropping to an overnight low of 43.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- You want some coffee?
- Thank you.
- Walked into city hall and shot Mayor Margolin.
In local news, the second body in 14 hours was found in North Beach.
Identified as prostitute Cindy Chow...
...the mutilated corpse was found in an alley behind the City Lights Bookstore.
Police had no comment on the two murders...
...stating only that they were similar.
According to the police chief, there are no leads.
In other news...
No.
Coffee's ready.
How do you take it?
Is milk okay instead of cream?
I have to talk to you.
- I'm running late.
- Amy, I have to talk to you now.
He's alive and out there.
I have no idea what to do.
You say you're after this man.
Are you a detective?
You work for Scotland Yard?
Leùs just say their interests are definitely involved.
I don't understand. Why can't you just go to the police...
...tell them who they're looking for?
- Whaùs wrong with that?
- They'd never believe me.
- You don't know that
- They'd never...
If you knew the story, you'd never believe me.
- I'd believe you.
- Well, they wouldn't.
If I told the truth, they'd send me to a lunatic asylum, not him.
All right. I led you to him, didn't I?
What were you doing, visiting bank after bank?
Would you have slept with anyone who knew where he was?
You don't suppose that for one minute.
No. I guess I don't.
I don't know, this is very confusing.
I'm late on top of everything else.
- Today is the executive staff meeting.
- Sorry.
I didn't want to burden you.
I'll get dressed and go.
No, no, no.
Oh, please, you stay.
I don't know what to say.
I like you. I like you very much.
I'd like to see you again.
I don't know how to help you, if you can't go to the police.
- I don't know where you're staying.
- Yesterday was my first day.
Will you stay here for a while? Eat something and try to sort things out.
I'll call you if I get any bright ideas, okay?
Be sure and slam the door when you leave or it doesn't lock.
One thing I wouldn't have pegged you as, a detective.
Well, you look like the cat that ate the canary. Did you?
- Hi, Carol, how's everything?
- "Hi, Carol, how's everything?"
You're the one who took off the whole afternoon.
In one word, fabulous. He's...
I just can't describe it.
On second thought, please don't try.
I may just die of envy.
I want you to meet him. Could you come for dinner Friday, around 7?
I'm sure it will be fine with Herbert.
Herbert?
You must really be hooked.
I think so. I'll just check my busy social calendar. Talk to you later.
Hello again.
I've come to change some more currency.
Yes, of course.
How much did you want to exchange this time?
Oh, say 40 guineas.
Forty guineas.
I'm sorry, would you excuse me for a moment? I'll be right back.
Take your time.
Herbert, Herbert.
Come on, come on.
Herbert, iùs me.
- Listen, he's here.
- Amy?
- Who is?
- Who do you mean who? Who do you think?
What?
He's right at my desk with a money belt.
He wants to change more sovereigns.
- Herbert, what do I do? I'm terrified.
- Amy, be calm. Iùs all right.
You're in a bank.
He's mad but he's not stupid.
Now, nothing's going to happen to you.
- Can you keep him there?
- What?
Iùs a lot to ask, but try.
Just until I'm there. I'm on my way.
- I'll try.
- What did you say?
I said I'll try.
Sorry about that. I checked what the exchange rates are today.
They fluctuate every day.
I wouldn't want you to get gypped.
- Are you enjoying San Francisco?
- Very much.
Thaùs wonderful.
- Find room at the Hyatt Regency?
- Yes, thanks to you I've...
Thanks to you.
You wouldn't happen to know a man called Wells, would you?
I thought so.
Miss Amy Robbins.
He asked you to detain me until he got here, right?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh.
I won't conduct my business here anymore, if iùs all the same to you.
Good day.
There's just one other item.
Be good enough to leave a message for Wells from me.
Tell him I want that key.
Tell him to leave it for me at the exhibit. Leave it...
...or face the consequences.
Have you got that?
Yes, I believe you have.
Herbert! You gotta bring the police into this. Now if you don't, I will.
That man is crazy,
I could see it in his face.
And he threatened you.
Something about leaving the key to the exhibit.
Leùs tell the police. If you don't,
I will, but I don't know what to say.
You can't fool around with a person like that.
"Robbins. 2340 Francisco."
His name is John Leslie Stevenson.
English, he's a surgeon.
Approximately 37 years of age, flaxen-hair, clean-shaven...
...and stands well above
6 feet in height.
What makes you say that this,
Dr. Stevenson...
...is responsible for the death of the girls?
I just know for a fact he is.
- I see. Do you have spiritual powers?
- Do I what?
Are you a medium or a mystic?
I make no claim to supernatural gifts of any sort.
If I could reveal the source of my information, I...
As a matter of fact,
I'm also a detective.
I was sent from London on the trail of Stevenson, traveling incognito.
My name...
- My name is Sherlock Holmes
- Sherlock Holmes, I see.
Go on, go on.
I can't. I gave you a complete description, I told you his name.
I've told you everything I know.
It was good of you to share your insights, Mr. Holmes.
How can we reach you if we need to speak to you?
Is that necessary?
I'm staying with a friend.
Must we involve her?
Not unless iùs unavoidable we contact you. We're known for our discretion.
Very well.
Her name is Miss Amy Robbins.
She lives at 2340 Francisco.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Holmes.
You don't believe me, do you?
I'd like to. My job would be simpler if I could.
This printout says U.S. Customs has no record...
...of John Leslie Stevenson coming here. British Customs has no record...
...of a man by that name leaving.
There's no mention of a Mr. Holmes...
...coming into the country. Now he could be using another name...
...but since we don't know where he is, we can't question him.
- Can we?
- No.
Well, thank you for your time.
Good day.
Put this on file.
The entire affair was a fiasco.
- He didn't believe a word of it.
- Well, you tried.
Trying isn't enough, I'm afraid.
- Are we in or out here?
- Out.
- Would you care to join me for a walk?
- Sure.
You have to slam it. All right.
Old buildings have their little quirks.
Why is it your responsibility?
I'm going to tell you the truth.
In the first place, my name isn't Herbert Wells.
Iùs Herbert George Wells.
H.G. Wells.
In the second place,
I'm 113 years old.
I swear to God, I am telling you the truth.
Please, please believe me.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
You don't believe me?
Christ, Herbert, what do you think?
Please go away, I don't want to see you anymore.
Amy!
Please, Amy, listen to me!
I have listened to you. And a bigger crock of shit I never heard.
Look, I don't know if you're crazy, but I don't care.
Just go back to whatever hole you crawled out of.
Go back to your machine.
Amy...
Wait! Amy!
Amy, what if I can prove what I told you is true?
Won't you give me that chance?
I know I sound mad!
I knew how you'd respond. Didn't I say yesterday you wouldn't believe me?
And I said I would.
All right. There is an H.G. Wells exhibit with time machine.
There is some resemblance between you and the man in those pictures.
The muzeum is closing.
But that doesn't prove anything.
- Now what?
- I want you to go to the powder room.
Hang on.
- Hello.
- Hi! Holy shit! Flowers.
Wow. Let me go put these in water. Come on in.
- You're early.
- I couldn't wait.
You're cute. Last time I had flowers was my graduation in high school.
You bring flowers to all your women?
Why don't you sit down and I'll be right in, okay?
You want some grass?
Grass?
Marijuana. Don't they call it grass where you're from?
England, right? I could tell from your accent.
You're observant.
Are you a typical American woman?
Am I a typical American woman?
Me?
Yeah, more or less. You know.
I like to hang out.
And what about you?
- Are you a typical Englishman?
- Not really.
Neat watch.
Are we going somewhere?
No.
Well, what time is it?
Later than you think.
This is really dumb.
Whaùs this gizmo?
Well, leùs just say we wouldn't want to go anywhere without it.
Right. This time I'll drive.
Come on. Get in.
You know what you're doing? What am I saying? This is completely bananas.
I don't propose to take you a great distance. Suppose we go to Saturday.
- How would that be?
- Just fine. My cleaning's due back.
That would make it November the 10th.
Don't expect too much. The entire voyage will last a quarter of a second.
- You ready?
- Come on.
Good. Can we go now, please?
- You still maintain this is poppycock?
- That wasn't the word I had in mind.
Amy, you just wait. You wait.
We've got to go back.
We must go back.
We could easily avoid this whole thing.
- You mean give him the key.
- No.
I mean come back with me.
- Back?
- Yes. Back to 1893.
I'm a 20th century woman. I have a career and a mind of my own.
Be reasonable. How am I gonna make it in 1893?
Iùs your life we're talking about.
My work is my life.
As much as yours or any other man's.
Please don't start sounding like my husband.
- Wait a minute? What about forward?
- Forward?
You mean into the future. Yes!
Of course...
No.
No. We're forgetting something. Him!
I can't just leave him here.
So much for your place or mine.
Stop a bit.
You know we're making a big mistake.
We keep imagining time is our enemy.
Iùs not.
We know whaùs supposed to happen.
When and where. He doesn't.
This is one time I do know how he thinks.
I even know before he thinks.
Look here. We're too late to prevent the murder of number three.
But what about number four?
Leùs see.
Dolores Marks. She was killed in McLaren Park. Is that far?
Nothing's far in San Francisco.
She was killed. Or rather she will be killed...
...at 3:00 in the morning in McLaren Park.
All I have to do is surprise him.
I'll just sit tight here for a few hours and then be off.
We. I'm coming too.
No. I absolutely forbid it.
Herbert, you can't drive.
You don't even know where the park is.
I'm safe. I've got till Friday at 7:30. Haven't you read the paper?
Too bad there aren't any sport stores open.
Whatever for?
So we could buy a gun.
- He's dangerous, haven't you heard?
- I wouldn't purchase a weapon now.
What is this Victorian chivalry?
We're playing for keeps.
Exactly. And Stevenson was right about one thing.
Violence is contagious. Like measles.
The problem is not that things aren't more efficient. They're the same.
World war this. World war that.
We're obviously killing more efficiently. But we're still killing.
Well, I'm not going to stoop to that man's barbaric level.
The first man to raise a fist is the man who has run out of ideas.
I love you.
Oh, no.
Whaùs happening?
Goddamn it! The tire is flat.
- Can you mend it? Can it be repaired?
- Yes. Iùs gonna take time.
All right, Amy. Calm down.
You work as fast as you can and I'll go telephone the police.
Where would I be likely to find one?
I don't know. There are phone booths all around. Do you have a dime?
Herbert, do you have ten cents for the call? Hurry!
- Here. Iùs 911.
- Read the instructions.
- I'll be right back.
Out of order? Damn!
Did you get that? McLaren Park.
Get there as soon as possible.
Can I what? Wells. No, Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes.
McLaren Park, as soon as possible.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
Oh, no. No.
IKeep moving.
Don't stop, do you hear me?
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Amy. Go! Come on!
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
First the zodiac and now this.
- Yeah, they're out for blood, I see.
- I see Mr. Holmes called.
- What time would that be?
- That was at 2:45 a.m.
Maybe he is psychic.
No.
We won't be here.
Iùs simple, we just won't be here.
- Iùs 10:30. I'm going to go out.
- No!
Just for a little bit. I'll come back, and we'll be off well before 7:30.
Where are you going?
Iùs something I've got to do.
And you do trust me, don't you?
I tell you what. Whaùs the best hotel in the city, your favorite?
The Huntington. I used to work there.
The Huntington. Write down the telephone number.
If I'm not back in an hour, register at the hotel. You've got the car.
- Promise you'll be back. Promise me.
- I promise. I promise.
Now you try and get some rest.
There's brandy in the flask if you need it.
Thaùs all right, I have some Valium.
- Sedatives.
- All right. Try and get some rest.
Hold it right there.
- What is the meaning of this?
- Shut up.
Amy!
- Look here.
- Listen, constable...
- Amy! Amy, get out of the house!
- Come on!
- Just get Lieutenant Mitchell...
- Look ahead.
- You're gonna have another murder.
- State your name, please.
I told you. Herbert George Wells.
What is this?
- Your valuables.
- Preposterous. Now please hurry.
- There is a lady in grave danger.
- Your watch, please.
My watch? This is ridiculous.
Please, where is Lieutenant Mitchell?
- You don't need that.
- Yes, we do.
Miss Amy Robbins is in very great...
Why do you need my glasses?
- I demand to see Lieutenant Mitchell!
- Relax.
I'm sorry, we have no one by the name
Amy Robbins registered at the hotel.
You've absolutely no right...
- Let me see Lieutenant Mitchell.
- No.
Now! Soon! Hurry! Please! Help!
I've told you. I've told you 50 times.
My name is H.G. Wells.
I came here in a time machine.
I'm pursuing Jack the Ripper...
...who escaped into the future.
If you don't do something, he'll kill Miss Robbins by 7:30.
What about the gun? They weren't making that model back in 1893.
I purchased it to defend Miss Robbins should the worst come to the worst.
- Where did you purchase it?
- A pawn shop. I don't remember it.
You're wasting your time.
Please listen to me.
Forget about the shop and the time machine. Forget that I'm H.G. Wells.
Please just save the girl.
You'll have to do better than that.
Last time you were Sherlock Holmes.
- All right, leùs take it from the top.
- My name is H.G. Wells.
I came here in a time machine.
The one at the muzeum.
- Just tell me what you want.
- I want the truth!
We're gonna stay here until I get it.
Take a look at this.
Thaùs right. Thaùs it.
Take a look.
Look, you cretinous idiot.
This is tomorrow's bloody paper.
You see what will happen if you don't listen to me!
Mr. Wells, or whatever your real name is...
...you know that novelty shops will run a phony newspaper edition.
You may have been born yesterday, but
I wasn't. Where did you get the gun?
Herbert.
Herbert?
You want to break for dinner? Hey!
I'll strike a bargain.
I'll confess to anything you like!
I killed them all.
Now, please...
Please send a car to 2340 Francisco.
Send a car and I'll sign whatever you want.
You're free to go.
I'm sorry.
Please believe me. I'm truly sorry.
Herbert.
Herbert, I'm over here.
He murdered Carol, my friend. I forgot
I invited her over to meet you.
- Amy?
- He's got the car.
Amy?
- The newspaper was wrong.
- Amy.
Not so fast.
We have a little unfinished business.
- What more do you want?
- You know what I want. Give me the key.
And you get the white queen.
All right.
- Let her go and I'll throw it to you.
- No.
My mother was atrocious, but she didn't raise mentally deficient sons.
You throw me the key and I'll release the girl.
- On your honor.
- You have my word as a gentleman.
Now there's just one thing.
I woulÔve expected that you'd noticed
I am not a gentleman.
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Herbert.
You know where we're going.
You haven't instructed him in the use of one of these machines?
Go faster. Please.
Go faster.
If I go any faster I'm gonna wrap us around a phone pole.
- Herbert!
- Stevenson!
Stevenson!
What is it, H. G? You're becoming extremely tiresome.
- The girl.
- Which girl? You mean this one?
Let her go. Please, I beg you.
You can afford to be magnanimous.
Women throughout the centuries are yours for the taking.
Is it so important?
I don't find her attractive. Do you?
You're not about to disagree?
No.
- No, what?
- No, I don't find her attractive.
- Shall I cut her throat then?
- No. Please.
John. You and I, we were friends once.
I admired you.
What are you babbling about, Wells?
You've become quite an old fool.
Yes. I am an old fool.
I know nothing.
And she means that much to you?
Yes.
Please.
I'm sorry.
H.G., iùs checkmate and you've lost again.
Herbert!
What did you do?
I sent him to where he belongs.
Infinity.
Thaùs the last anyone will hear of Jack the Ripper.
Iùs time for us to say goodbye before the police arrive.
You going back?
- Why?
- I've got to dismantle that machine.
Until we master ourselves we have no proper use for time.
I've got those books to write.
Whatever they are.
Fiction, I hope.
Every age is the same.
Iùs only love that makes any of them bearable.
And finally, I must go back because that is where I belong.
And my life is almost as important to me as yours.
Not quite.
Almost.
Herbert! You wait for me!
You wait for me!
Herbert!
It isn't life without you.
Please, look at me.
Don't expect miracles. I'm changing my name to Susan B. Anthony.
Leùs go.
Sorry. How much?
Three pounds, please.
Thank you.
Give us a fill-up.
I'm so sorry.
I must be a little tired.
I put it into reverse.
Yes, I can see that.
Of course I'm insured.
And whatever expense-
Of course, darling.
After all, it could have been worse.
Couldn't it?
Yes.
There's even a garage.
How long will it take?
Well, you'll need a new wheel.
We'll have to get that from Glasgow.
And it's the weekend.
Earliest will be Monday evening.
Okay, it's yours.
I'll see you on Monday then.
And don't bugger me about.
Are you going to Windermere?
Not into the town exactly.
Nearby.
Well, you'll take me there just the same, won't you?
It's the least you could do.
Right?
I'll drive.
I mean, we don't want to go all the way in reverse, do we?
Actually, you'll be doing me a favour.
You see, I've driven all the way from London and I do feel a little tired.
Then go to sleep.
Thank you.
Aren't you taking a lot for granted?
Look, darling, you don't have to worry.
I mean, I'm not gonna jump you or something.
The name's George.
And I'm Edna Simmon.
Hmm. You look a little like an Edna.
You up from London for the weekend?
More or less. My sister has a cottage near here at Southgate.
Hmm.
It is a warning against hysteria when confronted by ecological problems, many of which have been exaggerated.
And this so-called
Project for Survival by Goldsmith and Allen... has been signed by 33 English scientists, among them Julian Huxley.
What rot.
Ecological problems exaggerated.
You know, of course, when we all die, only the scientists will survive.
Oh, charming.
What's so important about Windermere?
A girl?
Beautiful country, low industry... and an isolated little house all mine... where from Saturday to Monday
I'll listen to the grass grow.
Very restful.
Stop!
Please.
Listen. I must be in Southgate this evening.
And if I take you to Windermere,
I'll be late.
What's so important about Southgate?
A man?
Oh, no.
I have to see my sister before
-Before what?
Look, I have a suggestion.
Take me there. Keep the car to go to Windermere and I'll send someone for it.
Then I'll be late.
Look, the house is new.
And I have an appointment with some friends to fix it up
-Oh, please!
Okay. Show me the way.
I've only been there once.
I remember a stream, but all these country roads look alike.
Well, there's a stream all right, but the road ends here.
Hang on a sec.
I'll go and ask.
Hey, what are you doing with the key? Why?
Not that I don't trust you, but I really can't risk your leaving me here on foot, can I?
Don't get your knickers in a twist. I'll be back soon.
George!
Ask for the Madison's house.
Hello? Anyone around?
There. For the prescribed area, keep it on an emission of 17 megahertz. Try it.
Right.
Ta very much.
Excuse me.
The road to the Madison's place?
Hang on a second.
I'll show you.
Now, before you lower it, I'll just adjust the cycle convergence.
All right.
Okay, sir, let's give it a whirl.
What is this thing?
It's supposed to destroy insects and parasites.
It was sent by the Department of Agriculture.
It's still experimental.
I'd send it right back where it came from... and keep the insects and parasites nature's given you.
What are you talking about?
Like that?
Just another machine to pollute the earth.
Till now, at least, this part of the country's been left alone.
What do you mean,
"pollute the earth"?
We're here to demonstrate to the growers just the opposite.
And they're all agreed.
I've got their signatures here in me pocket.
This works solely by ultrasonic radiation.
There's not a chemical involved.
You're quite right, sir.
If you don't like progress, those two's the wrong two to talk to.
Now where was it you wanted to go to?
Oh, the Madison place.
You go over that hill and on the right there's a big oak. and it's the first, second-
No, the third gate-
Come along with it, fella.
I'm used to traffic lights. Let's have it over again.
Oh, all right. Up from London, are ya?
I should've known.
Don't see too many young fellas dressed like you round here.
Anyway, if you hang on,
I'll go and put this thing down.
All right, Bernard, let's have another bash at the main rotator.
- Right.
Well?
No, nothing yet.
Hey, you did it.
Go back along the road on to the side of the river.
I'm sure you know a river when you see one.
George!
George! George!
That man, he's following me!
He tried to attack me!
Sorry, love, but I can't see anyone.
No, there was someone there.
Back there. He was horrible!
Are you certain?
He was very tall w-w-with black hair and a black suit.
And-And his clothes were wet as if- as if he'd just come out of the water.
You're wet too.
I fell into the water when I was running away.
-Don't be fright.
Must have been Guthrie, the loony.
-Who's that then?
-No, I were only joking.
Old Guthrie's dead.
He were a tramp.
He used to sleep down there by the river.
And then about a week ago he drownded hisself.
It seems to have been a suicide.
And now he's a ghost.
I'm sure he wanted to kill me.
He tried to get into the car!
It must have been another tramp trying to get some money out of you.
Old Guthrie used to do that, too, to every car that come along, eh?
Come on now, darling. You were sitting there all alone and he frightened you. That's all.
No. It was getting dark. More natural.
Come on. I found out how to get to your sister's house. Thank you.
Bye.
Katie?
Strawberries, Martin.
I wanted to bake a pie to celebrate my sister's visit.
Finished, are you?
Can I go now?
It's hard for me too.
You must understand, Katie.
I know you're making that impossible for me.
First you keep me here, like a prisoner, for a year.
And now, I know why you asked my sister to come here.
You didn't think I did, huh?
I know where you want to send me.
But I'll never go there!
Do you hear me? Never!
We'll do what you want.
Now please get hold of yourself.
Come on, darling.
I'm going to set up the camera and flashes for the last series of pictures.
Come straight back.
Will you be all right alone?
Will you be all right?
Do you believe that, about the tramp, or-
Or what?
-Or what I told you?
I'm not mad, you know.
I-I don't imagine things.
Me thinks the lady doth protest too much.
What? I resent that.
Listen, love, you have already ruined enough of my day.
Do you wanna fight now?
Jesus. You made me lose the way.
Now, how in the hell am I going to find this bloody place?
Is that you, Martin?
Martin! Martin!
Martin!
Martin!
Martin! Martin!
Help me, Martin!
Help!
Help! Help!
Katie!
Katie! Katie, what happened?
What happened? Where's Martin?
There, by the stream.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Never seen anything like it.
Somebody certainly enjoyed themselves here.
-A sadist, huh?
-Or a lunatic.
And enormously strong.
His whole torso's been caved in.
Every bone smashed.
-Have you notified headquarters yet?
-Yes, Sarge, but they're awfully busy this morning.
Can't send anyone before teatime.
-Button up, man.
You're wearing a uniform, not a pair of pajamas.
-Now look here, Sergeant.
I've got other things to do.
You can't keep me here all day.
I've told you, I've got nothing to do with this.
When there's been a murder, it's a funny thing, you know, but nobody ever has anything to do with it.
I tell you, I didn't even know the man.
I'm here by chance!
Continue the interrogation,
Benson.
Maybe we can find out what "chance" means.
-All right, yes.
-No one's seen or heard anything?
Any witnesses? Anything to go on?
-No. It was foggy,
Sergeant.
Um, but we've been told-
Well, there's this farmer who lives about a mile from here, and he says there was bad blood between the husband and wife.
A couple of times he saw 'em fighting.
-Bring him in for questionin'.
-Yes, Sergeant.
-Well?
-She's very consistent.
She insists it was a man dressed in black.
Very tall and well built.
-It was the same man who tried to attack me.
I saw him.
-Yes, and you're the only ones.
-But of course I saw him.
Why would I invent such a thing?
-Why? It's very simple, miss.
To back up your sister's story.
That's why.
-Come on. Everything's going to be all right.
Come on, dear. Drink your tea.
It'll do you good.
Everything will be all right.
Come on now. Drink up.
Nothing to be frightened of.
-Now, Mrs. West, you were alone when your husband was killed.
It wasn't the first time you had a fight, was it?
Could you tell us what these pictures are all about?
-I don't know.
I can't remember.
-But how- how can you think-
You saw what happened to Martin.
Only a very strong man could-
-Heroin.
Now, Miss Simon, you must be aware that under the influence of drugs, an individual can do things that otherwise are beyond... the reach of  his normal powers, and perhaps not even remember what he's done.
Just as your sister here doesn't seem to remember anything about these photographs.
You took a shot last night, didn't you?
Come on. Admit it!
-But this is monstrous.
What possible motive could Katie have had to want to kill Martin?
-Because after having kept her here for a year to get her off the stuff, and after becoming aware that she was still an addict,
Martin decided to put her into a clinic.
- Isn't that why you came down here from London?
- Yes, that's true, but-
- And you didn't want to go, did you?
- No, I didn't want to go!
In hospital, you wouldn't have been able to get any of this lovely stuff-
- But I didn't kill him! I didn't!
- Excuse me, uh-
- What is it?
- Sorry, but he says he's got something very important to tell you.
It's about time.
Let's hear it.
- You can come in.
- Thanks.
Well, it's like this, see?
I came up here yesterday to see my friends.
- Well?
- Well, can't you see?
I've got nothing to do with this.
I've got my house to look after. Will you tell him-
Listen, boy.
- You keep getting on my nerves, and I'm gonna give you another kind of house to look after, one with lots of  bars in the windows!
All right, all right!
Take it easy.
Don't get hysterical.
We'll pick this up again later.
I'm finished with you.
And with you too, miss.
For the moment.
- Don't worry, Katie.
There's a hotel in Southgate.
You can both book rooms there until you hear from me.
- But I want to stay with my sister.
Sorry, miss.
You must stay in the hotel.
- There must be a way to get her out of this.
- Yeah, a good London barrister.
- You think the police are right?
Never, especially not him.
- The camera. Of course.
Katie said that as she was being followed, the camera was taking pictures.
There may be a photograph of the man.
Come on. Let's tell the sergeant.
- Wait.
You see that cop by the Mini?
Yes.
Ask him for a light.
- Why?
- Go on!
I'm gonna do that bloody Irishman.
Excuse me.
Do you have a light?
No, I'm sorry, miss.
Never carry matches.
Haven't smoked in years, you know. Worst luck.
- What do you mean?
- Well, miss, you see, when I smoked,
I was as thin as a rail. But now, well-
- You could always start up again.
- I might do that one day.
- I wish I could stop smoking.
Thanks anyway.
- You're welcome, miss.
- Would you mind telling me what you're up to?
- Better we have it developed ourselves.
- Why?
- A little imbroglio, darling.
The cops never like to admit they're wrong.
- Craig.
- Yes, Sergeant.
- It's going to take ages, isn't it?
- Nope. He does them himself.
He said they'll be ready by noon.
I've asked him to blow 'em up too.
- For a man in love with solitude, which you say you are, this does look like the perfect place.
Wouldn't you agree?
- Do me a favour, darling. Don't try to be funny, all right?
We're in this mess together, aren't we?
- Good morning.
It won't bite.
You see, it's trained. Can I help you?
- Have you got any rooms?
- Would you go into the bar, please?
- Got two rooms? I guess that must cost less than a double, right?
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.
It’s just that we need the rooms to rest in, nothing more.
This is a respectable place,
I'll have you know.
- Yes, yes, I can tell.
I intend to spend as little time in it as possible.
Where can I make a phone call?
- Out there, under the stairs.
You wouldn't be the people involved in the murder, would you?
- Why?
- Message for you.
- Yes, I know I was supposed to arrive yesterday, but I've been delayed by an accident.
And I'm here just a few miles away.
Anyway, wait for me, and I'll be there as soon as I can.
Of course I'll be there.
Just a few things to finish up.
Okay?
- George. George!
- I gotta go. Bye.
- Katie's had a breakdown.
The police just phoned.
They're putting her in the local hospital.
Listen, we must go there.
- But I've got things to do. I’ve just-
- Please, I can't even think anymore.
You must help me.
I'm Mrs. West's sister.
Is it serious, Doctor?
- No. She's coming round now.
Oh, she needs rest.
Please, don't tire her.
- I didn't do it, Edna.
- Want one? They're perfect for the long voyage home.
- No, thank you.
What do you mean by "the long voyage home"?
- A touch of inside humour,
I'm afraid.
A little macabre, I know.
You see, from here to Manchester, it's quite a way to go in a freezer unit.
Yes, all the autopsies and examinations and tests on various organs... are done in Manchester.
Quite a few people leave their bodies to science these days.
How about it, young man?
Shall I make a reservation for you?
Oh, no.
It's the nursery again.
Nurse Jones! Nurse Jones!
Quick, look after her, will you?
Nurse Jones.
My God, where is everyone?
- My God. My God. The babies!
- Oh, my goodness.
What a nasty looking cut.
Come along with me, Nurse.
- Well, here, you can help.
All right, Doctor.
Will you hold it still?
It's happened again.
Are you hurt?
- No, but it tried its hardest.
Hmm.
- What the hell is wrong with it?
- We don't know.
It's the third one born since yesterday with an incredible aggressiveness.
Almost, well, homicidal in its intensity.
- Uh, some sort of virus? vNo.
We've done every sort of test.
It's very strange. All the children come from the same area around Southgate.
Near the river.
We tested the water too.
- That's curious.
- What is?
- Well, there's a farm over there where they've set up some sort of machine to destroy insects... by means of ultrasonic rays or something.
I thought perhaps-
You know.
- How interesting.
I'd like to have a look at it.
Do you think you could show me where it is?
- You can see, Doctor, the radiation works on the insect's nervous system.
It drives them mad and they attack one another.
I think we're gonna see a real revolution in agriculture.
- Not even DDT was this effective when it first came out.
- DDT causes cancer.
How 'bout this?
Now, listen, you've been on our back since last night.
Now, if you want to go back to nature, why don't you find yourself a nice Pacific atoll somewhere-
- Sure. All I'd have to worry about then is atomic fallout.
Thanks awfully, old chap.
- What's the range of this machine?
Oh, about a mile at present.
We're trying to perfect one up to five miles.
But of course this can't have anything to do with the children, now, could it? It's absurd!
- Now, Doctor, you're a man of science.
Surely you can understand this machine has undergone the most stringent testing.
The radiation only affects the most primitive forms of nervous systems, like microbes and insects.
- It has no effect on more evolved systems, such as human ones.
It's completely harmless.
- How can you be certain?
- Look, do I look like I'm about to attack you?
And I'm surrounded by radiation.
- Now, it's all right.
I understand.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, perhaps they're right.
It's not the answer.
- I'm afraid not.
Still, you know, a newborn child's nervous system is still in a very elementary state.
Well, if you have any doubts, why don't you do something- make some noise, insist on more tests?
- It's never wise to exaggerate.
We can't even get the government to act on much more serious and concrete facts these days.
Imagine what success we'll have getting anyone to do anything on a mere hypothesis.
I'm afraid they'd laugh at us.
- I don't understand.
You can only see Katie.
But look at her.
Doesn't it seem as if someone or something's after her?
- Mm-hmm.
It's a good thing the police haven't seen this one.
She really looks as if she's about to do him in.
- So you think she's guilty too.
But I tell you, the man exists.
I saw him!
Listen, you knew him.
I mean, that tramp we heard about, the one who drowned last week.
- Oh, Guthrie.
- Yes!
- Of course. Why?
- Do you have a picture of him or anything?
- No.
- Look.
I know it sounds silly, but is it possible-
I mean, could a film fail to catch an image for any reason?
- Well, a ghost, maybe.
- No one believes in ghosts anymore, including the police.
You see, we're not quite as stupid as you seem to think we are.
Ah, very interesting.
Now I can see why you wanted to keep this roll of film.
- Look, she had nothing to do with it.
It was my idea.
- Of course.
You're all in it together.
Aiding and abetting a suspect, withholding information.
You and your bird here will have to answer for it at the inquest.
- I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that you fellas could just possibly be barking up the wrong tree.
- Not when dealing with people like you.
You're all the same, the lot of you, with your long hair and faggot clothes, drugs, sex, every sort of filth.
And you hate the police.
Don't ya?
- You make it easy.
- See you at the inquest.
And, uh, don't get any ideas about not being there.
- Heil Hitler.
We've got ourselves into enough hot water for today.
Let's get back to the hotel.
- You're off about? Who's paying for the pictures?
That'll be two quid.
- Here you are. Thanks for your trouble.
- It was nothing, miss.
Oh, by the way, you wanted Guthrie's picture.
There's one here in Monday's paper... taken right after they took him out of the water.
- Oh, my God! George.
- What is it?
- It's him!
The man I saw, the one who killed Martin!
- But that's absurd. The man's dead.
- But I tell you, it's him!
- Look, love, use your head.
He died last week and Martin was killed last night.
- George, I tell you, that is the man, and his clothes were all wet.
He looked exactly like someone who drowned.
- Listen, are you certain he's dead?
I mean, was there a death certificate?
- Oh, sure. I was there when they put him in the coffin.
And two days ago we took him to the cemetery.
No one wanted to bury him because he didn't have any money.
In fact, they didn't even want him to be cremated.
It's all there in the paper.
You read it.
- Then he must have a twin brother, that's all. Thanks a lot.
- What are we going to do now?
- Get in.
- Craig! They're up to something.
Follow them and keep me up to date.
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Wait, wait.
Better take my car.
- Oh, all right. vWhere are we going?
- To the only place where I can cure you of your fancy hallucinations.
Here we are.
- George. Wait a minute.
- If the man is dead, he must be here, right?
We'll find out if he's here, okay?
If he is here, then I want you to knock it off about seeing a man in black and all that rot... because, love, the dead don't walk around, except in very bad paperback novels.
They're dead, and that's that.
Do we agree?
- If you say so.
- Anyone about?
All right. Let's try in there.
Hello? Anyone at home?
Hello?
- Let's go.
There's no one here.
- No, wait a minute.
Maybe this Guthrie's in one of these.
"Mary Duggan."
Hello, darling.
Who are you?
"Edward Keith."
"Guthrie Wilson."
Here he is.
- George, let's go.
- What the-
- Hey! You've shut us in!
Hey!
Let us out!
Let us out!
George!
George!
Stop!
- I don't believe it.
Get up that ladder as fast as you can! Move!
- George!
George!
- Get out! Get out!
Hurry!
- Help!
- Craig here.
- Have you found 'em yet?
- Yes, Sergeant.
They're in the cemetery.
- The cemetery?
What the hell are they doing in there?
- I don't know, Sarge.
I was just gonna go in and have a look.
- George!
- Strewth!
Give us your hand.
- Let's get out of here, quick!
- What the devil's happening here? Would you please explain?
Get inside, quickly!
Get inside!
Quickly! Go on!
Go on!
Christ! There's no way out.
That's useless.
Come on. Help me.
- They're- They're dead, aren't they?
- Yeah.
But don't ask me,
'cause I haven't the foggiest.
Christ only knows what brought them back to life again.
Oh, God.
I think I do know.
The radiation!
Of course. It worked on the babies' nervous system.
Why not on those of the dead?
- What the hell are you raving about, man?
- Craig, when a person dies, perhaps the nervous system goes on living for a while.
Perhaps in some very basic, crude way, like an insect's.
Or a plant. Look, you can pick a flower, but it goes on living for a while.
- You're right.
That man Guthrie, didn't he die when they began the experiment?
- Well, all right.
He was the first, but the others-
- They transmit life to each other through the blood of the living.
Like a plague.
That's why they kill.
- Now you know who it was that killed Martin.
- I can just imagine the sergeant's face when he finds out.
- I'd like to be there when he does.
If we get out of this alive.
- Let's reinforce that door.
Take the lamp!
This won't hold very long.
We've got to find a way to defend ourselves.
- What with?
Silver bullets or a wooden stake?
- Oh!
My radio-
It's the sergeant trying to get through.
I must have left it near that hole outside.
If I could just get to it, or get to the car, I could call for help.
- Craig, can you hear me?
What the Christ has happened to the lazy bastard?
- Ah, he turned his set off.
- Craig, can you hear me?
- The coroner’s just completed his examination, Sergeant.
Will you drive him back?
- Yes.
I sent a man to trail two suspects, but I don't get any answer.
It's funny.
I'll send you an ambulance.
Take the body to the hospital. We'll have to have an autopsy.
- Help me to move this.
I'm gonna get the radio.
Craig, it's madness!
You'll never make it.
- It's our only chance.
Okay.
Maybe you'll think better of the police if I can pull this off.
- Good luck, man.
- Sergeant, this is Craig reporting at the cemetery.
There are dead people trying to kill me!
No!
- Christ, we've got to get out of here.
- No, George. I'm afraid.
- What difference does that make?
[Crashing]
Come.
You take the Mini back to the cottage and tell the police what's happened.
- What about you?
- I'm gonna fix that bloody machine.
Come on.
It's all over with now.
There's no more danger.
- And Martin-
His body's still back there. The radiation could-
- No. They only have a range of a mile or so.
The cottage is at least three or four miles away.
Go on.
I'll wait for you at the farm.
Edna!
It was the machine! You've gotta stop it.
- What are you doing?
- Wait. Wait. Now, look.
Wait! Listen!
You talk about the dead walkin', about cannibalism.
It's unscientific, man.
- Lots of things are unscientific, but they happen just the same.
Turn off that goddamn machine!
Get along there.
- Aye. It runs like a charm, laddie.
It's killed everybody in sight round here, except for you.
And we got the range up to five miles now. Five miles?
- Aye, five bloody miles.
- Since when?
- A little while ago.
Just before you got here.
- Hold him! And stop him!
Stop him!
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- I'm gonna have to call the police, you know.
- Right! Bernard, what are you doing on the ground?
- He's broken our cinescope.
I'll go for the police.
- No, don't chase him again, Clive.
- Come on, Bernard.
- Hey! Wait! Stop!
I've got to get to the Madison's place!
Hey, wait!
Wait!
- We have to burn the corpse!
Don't you understand?
There's not a moment to lose!
Come back!
We're all in danger!
- Well? She had any calls from her sister or that man?
- Nothing at all.
- Thank you.
No, Sergeant.
No one's seen them, and they haven't called.
- Phone in for reinforcements and search for them.
Make a house-to-house and scour the countryside.
And arm the men.
They killed Craig and the caretaker, so if they resist, shoot to kill.
Poor Craig.
If you'd only had time to notify us.
- The thing I don't understand is the difference in the bodies.
Those have been horribly mutilated, whereas those look like they were intact.
- What the hell did they burn the bodies for?
That's what I wanna know.
Couple of drug-crazy maniacs.
- Oh, worse than that, Sergeant.
Have you ever come across any of these satanists in your investigations?
- No, but I've heard about them.
Y-You don't think-
- They vandalize cemeteries.
They profane tombs and, you know, hold black masses.
That's why you’ve got your cross.
It looks to me like a pretty typical case.
- Now, if I could only get me hands on them.
- Oh, Sergeant. That madman went to a nearby farm and caused a row over there.
Perhaps you should talk to them.
Uh, excuse me.
The sergeant's in charge of the case.
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This gentleman's from the Ministry of Agriculture.
- Sergeant?
Sergeant Mahoney!
Sergeant!
No!
- Edna, what's happened?
What's happened, Edna?
Martin.
- He tried to kill me.
I ran over him with the car.
He's back there.
George!
I'm so- I'm so frightened.
It's so awful.
- Can you manage?
- Petrol. How many gallons?
- Quick. Help me.
- Oh, the poor lassie.
- Is there a phone about?
- Yes, in there. Inside.
- Okay. Call for an ambulance, and hurry up!
- Hey, what are you doing?
That's paraffin.
- I haven't time to explain.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
- Marie, get her something to drink.
Now, you just sit down there.
Move! Get her something to drink.
Water, not whiskey!
She may not have any money.
Come on, lass.
We're to call the hospital.
Are you all right, love?
- No!
- Grab him!
Let go!
- Sorry to spoil your fun, old boy, but we sent Martin's body to the hospital... for an autopsy.
As for poor old Benson,
I'd like to-
- Sergeant, listen to me.
Put out an alarm at once.
If Martin arrives at the hospital, we're right back where we started.
There are three bodies in there, and he can bring them back to life!
- Bring the dead back to life, is it?
What kind of idiots do you think we are?
- It's the truth.
You've got to stop him!
- Get him out of here before
- Can't you see? We've got to burn him!
- That's enough of that.
- Go to the hospital if you don't believe me!
- All right then, Bernard. See if you can switch on.
- Right.
Well done, Clive.
- This!
What's the meaning of this?
- Oh, for crying out loud.
What do you think I am?
I've never been to a black mass in my life.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I sell this kind of stuff, Sergeant.
I was bringing this lot to a shopkeeper in Windermere.
He was- Oh, what's the use?
- You expect us to believe all that after everything that's happened?
- Look, it's not my fault, Sergeant, if Christ and saints are out of fashion.
And it's not against the law yet, so why don't you get off my back?
- Where's your girlfriend hiding?
- Go find her, since you know so much.
- You admitted burning the corpses.
- Well, I told you why!
We caught you in the act as well, and this here statement clearly confirms what we already know.
- Sign here, and it'll be a lot easier for you.
Admit killing two officers, and it'll be all over.
- It was the corpses.
Don't you understand?
The corpses. The corpses!
You sit in here wasting time, and there are people in real danger!
You- You're the ones who are crazy, not me!
You bloody idiot!
- The son of a bitch killed two of my men!
- Get a hold of yourself, man.
- Go clean him up.
- Come with me.
Come with me, please.
- I disapprove of your methods, Sergeant.
The police should never resort to violence.
- And I disapprove of yours,
Mr. Perkins.
- If we just had a free hand with these criminals.
- Sergeant! Sergeant, he got away.
- Kinsey! Kinsey!
- I tried to stop him, but I couldn't.
- Where's she gone?
Look at the mess she's made!
- You might have told me she was violent.
You'll pay for this down to the last penny!
- Where is she?
- You told me to call an ambulance. They took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?
- All that talk about the dead coming to life.
I think she must be insane.
- So how was the film?
Come on. Tell me all about it.
[Buzzing]
Hold on.
Southgate Hospital.
Good evening.
- Get me Duffield!
You're all in terrible danger!
- Yes. Can I help you, please?
- Christ! Don't waste time!
Give me the operating room!
- I can't do that. I mean-
- Look, let me speak to Dr. Duffield!
He'll understand. Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
- Hold on a minute, Christine. You ought to hear the bloke on the other line. He's balmy.
Yeah.
- Then help me. No!
No. Please.
- Room 5.
Doctor, it's for you.
- Hello!
Hello? Hello?
- What are you waiting for, man?
- I don't know, Dr. Duffield.
He didn't say who he was.
Very well.
Sorry. What were you saying about that film?
Oh, no. I can't stand him.
He's really awful.
Don't like her much either. No.
Oh, she looks like-
- Please, Doctor.
Can't you let me see my sister?
Just two minutes. The officer's gone, and my sister would be so happy.
- Yes, it'll do her good.
Come along now.
She's up on the second floor.
- Martin!
No! Help! Martin!
Oh!
Help! Help!
Help!
- Katie.
Don't worry about me.
I'm much better now.
Help! Help! Help me!
Help me!
Help! No!
What's going on?
- Nothing.
Must be that lunatic in Room 5.
She was screaming like that earlier when they brought her in. Convulsions.
- Who's with her?
- Dr. Duffield. It's all right.
- Edna!
- George!
George!
Get away from me!
- Edna.
- I wish the dead could come back to life, you bastard, because then
I could kill you again.
- Keep out of the way.
Out of the way, please.
- Please tell us how to take care of all the bodies.
- Put 'em on ice till the coroner gets here.
- Come on. Let's go.
No, that's enough of that.
Come on. Let's get out.
- Where to?
Back to the station?
- No, I booked a room in the hotel here.
All I need is a good night's sleep and time to forget this whole bloody mess.
- I don't think you'll do that.
The papers'll be going crazy over it.
They like you. It looks like you'll be a regular hero.
- Justice has been a bit slow in these parts, with all this permissive rot going on.
Maybe people learned a thing or two from my example here.
- They say that machine works wonders.
It killed every parasite for miles.
We'll have a fabulous apple crop this year, Sergeant.
I'm mad about apples.
- Good night, Sergeant.
- Good night, Kinsey.
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!
Nuclear com-force to main engine room!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
Major Bradbury to communication bridge!
What is it like, the planet we're approaching?
Nothing but ice and snow.
A barren desert of whiteness.
Scan it with our computer waves.
The enemy's weapons may be hidden beneath its surface.
Aha!
Looks like the cops.
As Thor, chief of the imperial police,
I order you to surrender at once
Stella, you cheap smuggler
I am police robot M.
You have the right to remain silent.
Go for hyper space.
Let's hope this star-buggy stays together.
What's our chances?
40% total disintegration..
30% molecular ignition..
..20% gamma contamination.
You are very reassuring
I assume that means - we have a 10% chance of making it.
Not really!
3% structural collapse
Alright Alright!
Just keep on course and get ready to reenter normal space.
Ready when you are.
We've done it!
We've done it!
Not quite. Look!
The Nutrant star!
If it gets a hold on us, it'll crush us.
Prepare to release
Ath-Power stage.
Eject!
Eject!
Ha Ha!
We made it.
Plot us a new course, so that cop cant find us.
Even as you speak.
It's been taken care of.
There's the border of the haunted stars.
If we'd traveled one second further, we would have wound up right beside them.
What in the universe is that?
It's a spaceship.
No, its a launch.
Their power is totally down.
Maybe they're wounded, to weak to send a signal.
I'm gonna have a look.
What's the radiation level?
Normal.
The hull isn't damaged.
I'm going inside.
Is everything alright?
Yes!
Wait a minute..
There's someone here.
He looks like he's hurt pretty bad, but he's alive
I'll try to get him back to the ship.
I'll help you bring him aboard.
He's dehydrated.
Suffering from exhaustion.
But the launch was full of supplies.
Everything he could have needed.
He's also in chock.
He keeps talking about monsters..
..Red monsters
He wants us to alert someone..
Urgently.
Who?
The Emperor of the first circle of the universe.
It's the emblem of the chief officers of the imperial navy.
I'd say red hot potatoes for small time smugglers on the run like us.
We'll, what do we do?
You go to prison, Stella star.
Your leap through hyperspace didn’t fool us.
Your friction trail was easy to follow.
Hehehe..
You are completely surrounded by fighter ships.
This time you've won.
We surrender.
There won't be a next time, Stella Star!
Don't worry.
We'll get out of this.
My Lord!
Yes. What is it Ellrik?
They found one damned survivor.
Right now, the imperial shuttle ship has taken him to their medical centre.
But his brain seems to be thoroughly damaged
He will be of no help to them, to find the ship.
Mhmm..
Come to me, Golem!
I have a simple task for you.
You must not fail me.
Therefore, the great machines of the central operating system..
..of imperial justice hereby sentence you,
Akton, of ninth Vega..
..to 220 years hard labor in the prison planet of Ze-com the 3rd.
As for you, Stella Star, having considered all the arguments..
Studied all the Video-tapes, the accusations..
..we condemn you to forced labor for life..
..in the penal colony..
..of Nocturne the 2nd
This session is hereby adjourned.
Throw the radium into the furnace.
Careful now.
I said let's go, move!
Faster!
Move, Let's go!
Will you step it up!
Here! You can move faster than that!
Careful with that Radium.
Will you move!
Move down those stairs!
Throw it the furnace!
Do what I tell you!
Where do you think you are.
We haven't got all day!
Alright, 5 minutes of rest
Move quickly now!
Prisoners get back to their posts!
Let's go!
Come on quickly now!
Let's go!
I've been at this for 12 straight hours..
..the radiation will burn my skin off.
Were not slaves.
You'd better work.
If you don’t want the taste of the burning of their energy whips too.
But there must be a way to escape.
There will be a way, you know.
Blow ups happen.
If I could only succeed in overfeeding the furnace.
But overfeed it with what?
Energy!
Then a gun ray could be enough.
Planing an escape!
This is what you're gonna get, lady!
You can drop the riffle-ray.
Now turn around.
You!
I bet you never expected to see me here.
And you too.
Poor Stella.
Your escape efforts have been wasted.
OK.
I've lost again.
We were sent to free you, your sentence has been cancelled.
Have you both gone mad?
I only have logic animotion circuits.
No room for craziness.
Well, I've been assigned to a top secret imperial mission, we must now leave and set Akton free.
There, he's yours
My gift to you.
Would I lie to you?
Look, it is the imperial flagship.
Akton, you are gonna meet some real royalty.
He's here!
There is his holographic image.
His Highness; The emperor of the first circle of the universe.
I come to you because my faithful robot,
Elle, has told me..
..that you are the only one who could save us.
You know, you must be the best pilot in the whole galaxy..
..and you Akton, the best navigator.
Stella, our galaxy is split..
..into 2 waring factions.
Our own and the one ruled by the evil count..
..Zarth Arn!
From the league of the dark worlds.
Recently we've begun to receive troublesome reports from our spies among the league.
They have informed us that the count has created a weapon..
..a new, limitless weapon.
A Weapon so vast, so huge..
..that it would take a whole planet to conceal it.
That is why we sent the mission ship.
Did they find the planet?
The ship came so close..
..so close..
..to discovering the counts secret..
.. when it was suddenly attacked by a horde of unknown monsters.
We had assumed it was destroyed, we lost all hope.
Until you found the launch from that ship.
And now, with the utmost secrecy..
..you must sail to the haunted stars.
You must find that ship.
Find the counts secret planet and destroy it.
There's something else.
When you complete the mission..
.. search for the commander..
..of that missing ship.
He was my only son.
The first possibility is the Origa system.
Also know as the worlds asleep.
But this system is still within our galaxy and we should've found it by now.
The same also applies to the white sun of Ohzon so only the third possibility remains:
The heart of the haunted stars.
An unknown planet named..
Euraphas!
Well, shall we begin our search?
Lets go!
The distance we must travel is enormous.
By using hyperspace, what would normally take 2 months to reach
We should do in 2 hours.
Everything ready?
Ready! Right!
Every time I go into hyperspace
I get nervous.
Prepare for re-entry to normal space.
We've arrived!
Its not very far from here.
You can reach by using the space shuttle.
Thor and I will wait for you there.
Hidden in that canyon.
So that were ready in case of another surprise attack of the count.
That sounds fine with me.
Is there air out there?
Yeah. Yeah you can breathe.
Alright. lets go!
Follow me!
I'm sure you can operate the shuttle ship.
The controls are easy!
Now watch your step right here.
Take care.
You alright?
You bet. Lets go.
Don't you think were a little low?
I haven't been programmed to walk on water.
Ohh me. water makes me so nervous
Everything makes you nervous.
It's the launch.
Lets land.
OK! Take it in easy.
Shuttle to star-ship!
We are landing now.
Roger. Out.
My seat-belt’s stuck.
Oh Elle, come on!
Take it easy, I'm coming.
Look at that!
Amazing!
It's almost buried.
The impact was tremendous.
I doubt if anyone could have survived.
The nuclear exhaust ports have been gutted by fire.
We'd better look around.
What's that?
I don't know.
Seems to be a planetary artifact.
Well, it certainly is an antique.
Looks like some sort of Laser spear.
This planet is inhabited.
We must be very careful.
We are in the evil counts domain.
These stars are extremely far and remote, even for him.
Probably they've set up a fully independent kind of civilization.
We're wasting time. We'd better start looking for the missing crew.
Come on. Lets go this way.
Look!
Amazons on horseback.
I hope they are friendly.
We'll soon find out.
Take my revenge.
Kill 'em.
Die robot.
You'll pay for this -
All of you!
Don't make us kill you.
Come on!
Stop!
There is no escape.
Take your hands off of me.
Let me go.
Get your hands off of me.
Let me go.
Queen Querrelia. This is the spy we captured.
She came through the forbidden sea.
You're a spy.
As the men from the launch were too.
But nothing is going to stop the count anymore.
Even if you had passed by this world..
..you'd never be able to discover the counts planet.
Two packs of murdering guardians are there to watch and protect it from intruders.
..and now:
Put her into the mind probe.
No! No!
Hold it right there!
Elle!
Release her or I'll blast your queen.
I mean it.
Come on now.
Don’t you people move or you are dead.
Give me the trouble and I'm gonna clean out your sinuses real good lady
Now you stand there.
Ok, Close the door.
Don’t you follow us now.
Stop them!
Stop them!
Behind you!
Come on, lets go!
Elle you're terrific.
I didn't know you had it in you.
Where's the release mechanism?
It's jammed!
Take cover!
Here goes the last shot.
Full power!
Come on, lets go!
Hurry! Hurry!!
Guardian..
..take my revenge.
Kill them.
Look!
Whoa!
Run for your life!
There! That narrow passage in the rocks.
Come on Stella, run!
Hurry!
Oh! Elle!
We better move!
The amazon air-fighters will be here soon.
Quick, to the ship!
They're attacking.
I'll man the laser-canon.
Specter 7..Fire!
Ok, get ready.
Here they come.
Power is up to full battle speed.
You!
Why don't you come back now?
Here they come. Specter 3.
Alright.
We've got them!
Fire! Fire!
Yeah!
One more.
There's one more!
We've got 'em.
Watch out on the right.
We're down from 6 to 5.
Get ready.
More to the left.
Steady.
Then fire 5.
Then 6.
Fire the laser-canon, robot.
Fire!
Yeah! Hahaa!
We got it!
We're holding.
Now!
8 ships approaching from the right. Fire!
Alright, we've won.
We did it.
I found the positions to both the 3rd launch and the mother-ship.
The mother-ship is closest so we'll check it out first.
It's here.
On the 3rd planet of the next solar system.
I've never been there.
What's it like?
Red fogs, high winds, low gravity.
The air is breathable.
And the atmospheric conditions are stable.
However..
The entire planet is covered with ice and snow.
And you must be extremely careful when the sun sets.
The temperature drops thousands of degrees.
And in an instant, everything freezes over.
What a terrible crash.
No-one could have survived.
Do you see any signs of the emperors son?
If he's in the middle of all this
I don't even know if his own mother would recognize him.
Then it's all over.
There's no hope of ever finding the counts secret fortress.
There's still the third launch.
It's probably lost out in the stars, who knows?
Anyway, it's useless to raise false hopes.
It's been too long.
And this galaxy is wild and hostile.
Come on Elle, lets go back to the ship.
We'd better hurry.
We're running out of time and our power-packs are nearly finished.
Let's get rid of them.
It's gonna be a long walk back.
My feet are already cold.
It's times like these i'm glad to be a robot.
What's the matter with you, Akton?
Well, I'm just refining my powers.
And what's your problem, ships-computer, huh!
Is everything alright with Stella and Elle?
I'm not worried about them.
I'm just waiting.
Your waiting is over.
At last Thor.
You have some good news for me?
Yes Excellency.
I have killed the alien pathfinder..
..and taken over this ship.
What of Stella Star?
And that tin policeman.
This planet will take care of them, Excellency.
Good!
And I await your immediate arrival.
Elle, how much further?
We should be close.
Just a few more radiants.
Ships-computer!
Why aren't the main engines firing?
There is a malfunction.
A malfunction?
Where?
I am not programmed for this malfunction.
Akton!
We're here!
Akton! Thor!
Let us in. The sun is setting.
That's exactly why I'm not letting you in.
Soon you'll be dead and
I'll be gone from this planet.
Have you gone crazy? Open this hatch!
No!
Where's Akton?
Akton is dead.
And I'm leaving to join Count Zarth-Arn..
..as the prince of the League of Darkness.
Thor, a traitor?
I cannot believe it.
I cannot trust my own logic circuits anymore.
He fooled me too.
It's no use. We're gonna freeze.
Maybe not.
Maybe I can save you.
Let's stop here.
Now you lie down in the snow, face up.
Okay.
Now give me your hand so I can monitor your temperature.
I can use my energy to keep your heart working.
You'll be in a state of suspended animation.
Elle!
As an opponent, I always knew you were programmed to never give up.
Which was infuriating.
But now that quality..
..must be..
..best.
You are the most faithful companion a woman ever had.
And I too, respect you, Stella.
You are the nicest human being I've known.
Now, maybe, is a good time to use your ancient system of prayer.
And hope it works for robots, as well.
Goodbye my friend.
Goodbye for now, Stella.
You were expected here hours ago!
I've been delayed by a malfunction.
I don't tolerate malfunctions..
..or inefficiency here in my realm
How long will the delay be?
I think a very long time.
You shouldn't try taking off without asking me first.
This time I'll make sure you are dead.
I'll fix you.
Alright Akton.
This is it.
Say goodbye.
What?
Stop!
Put down the gun.
Stop!
No-one can survive these deadly rays.
Those deadly rays will be your death.
Elle?
Elle, do you read me?
This is Akton.
I've taken over the ship.
Do you read me?
Her pulse rate is 16.
She may survive if you can use your powers and bring her back slowly.
Careful now.
Close the hatch.
Look! It's working!
She's going to make it.
Come on Stella!
Whats wrong?
The main engines will not fire.
Thor must have tried everything.
What are we gonna do now?
So..We get out of one mess..
..just to find ourselves in another.
Not necessarily.
What do you mean?
We are stuck!
Even the transmitter is out of order.
We can take off immediately.
Take off?
How?
The ship is not operating, simply because I borrowed this reactor.
Then you knew about Thor.
Yes I did.
So you see into the future.
All these years you never told me.
Think of all the trouble
I might have avoided
You have tried to change the future.
Which is against the law.
So therefore, I can tell you nothing.
Let's find the 3rd launch.
Akton, you are something else!
Yes.
Time is running out.
Lets go!
We're arriving.
That's the planet Demundia.
There in barren land and wast emptiness we'll find the 3rd launch.
Somethings wrong.
Everything has stopped.
What's happening?
Power failure!
My circuits!
My circuits are failing.
We've been hit.
By an energy beam.
I am out of control.
Look!
What is it?
It must be the Counts weapon!
Oh my head, oh!
Fire, you stupid robot!
Fire!
What's happening?
Here, let me help you.
The attack is over.
You'll be alright.
I thought I was gonna go insane.
We've just survived an attack of the most powerful weapon in the entire galaxy.
If Akton's calculations are correct we should find the launch this way.
In a crater just over..
There!
Oh me!
Don't say it. Don't say
I know..
Steam makes you nervous.
No, no! Not really.
Why should I be nervous?
There is nothing to be afraid of round here.
Looks totally wrecked but it's definitely the third launch.
I'd better go down.
No, I insist.
Time for a little robot-chauvinism.
You stay here.
Be careful Elle.
You do not have to worry about me!
Release her!
Let me down!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Don't.. Don't..
Relax.
Take it easy.
I'll cut you down.
There.
You're free.
That was a little too close for comfort.
Come on.
Come on!
We rest here.
This is safe.
Who are you?
This is an energy-shield mask.
And the amount of energy is limited.
My name is Simon.
I'm the only survivor from the wreck of an imperial mission.
Are you really?
We've been searching for you all through these damned haunted stars.
Why?
The emperor's orders were to find the Count's phantom planet and to destroy it.
So you know about the monsters?
Yes I do.
But it's useless.
We did not succeed in find the planet either.
And now there's no time left.
The cavemen will waiting for us.
Alright, stay very close and very quiet.
Oh, this way looks safe.
This way.
Simon!
No!
Akton!
You alright?
Akton, thank god you got here in time.
You must've known all along.
By the way, this is Simon.
The only survivor from the imperial mission.
We owe you our lives.
Now maybe..
..with your help, we can still find the Count's phantom planet
Lets go aboard your ship and continue on at once.
There's no need to continue.
Have you gone crazy?
That's our primary mission: To find the planet and destroy it.
I know, but we've already found it.
Think about it.
Then you'll understand that this is the Count's planet.
Remember what the Amazon queen said:
A planet occupied by two packs of evil defenders.
The first we met while in space.
The red monsters.
And the second..
Right here. The Troglodytes.
And there’s no question about it.
This is the planet!
This?
That's incredible.
I was here and I didn't even realise it.
There's no way you could have.
Anyway, we proceed at once and destroy all that machinery.
Right?
Right.
There is the door that'll take us to the machinery.
This is the Counts secret domain.
The very heart of the phantom planer.
From here he plan to control the entire universe.
This is incredible.
Where is everybody?
Everything is set in our destiny.
Soon you'll know all the answers.
This will take us to operation headquarters.
After you, my dear.
Here's the nerve center of the entire operation.
This is unbelievable.
Fantastic.
Pre-programmed computers.
They could run forever.
All these power modules, what are they for?
This is the force that projected the red monsters into space.
Then this is the way they produced real monsters?
No. Not real.
The monsters never existed.
These machines discharged mental projections of monsters in our brains
There's the control-panel.
Well, destiny must take it's course.
No, we can't allow this to happen.
We must destroy it, at once.
You've been very lucky.
And clever.
You survived every trap that I'd lay for you.
Then I realized that your success would become my triumph.
How much time is left, Captain?
Half a quadrant to go, My-lord.
You hear?
In less than an hours time
All that'll be left of this planet
Will be ashes and cosmic dust.
Forever.
Then you will be among the dead.
The emperor will make you pay for this.
The Emperor?
I forgot to inform you..
..that the Emperor will be blown to pieces along with the rest of you.
Yes!
I told the emperor that we had found you on this planet.
He's on his way here now, at top speed.
He'll get here just in time..
..to join the fireworks.
I'm sorry, your highness.
You've lost.
Highness?
Forgive me Stella.
But in the beginning
I didn't know whose side you were on.
And after-wards
I didn't know how to tell you
Yes, he is Simon, son of the Emperor and heir to the throne.
You two are to prevent them from leaving this room at all cost.
You will stay with them until the end.
Kill them..
..if you have to.
Now it will be just a matter of waiting.
An hour goes by quickly.
We've got to get past those golems.
Yes, but how?
Have faith.
And never give up hope.
Look out!
We are now approaching Demundia.
All crewmen to landing stations.
All crewmen to landing stations.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
You and the prince will live.
Akton, you've got to get up.
We must get away from here.
I shall remain here.
Please get up, please.
I'm no longer useful at this time.
You're talking nonsense.
You can heal yourself in no time at all.
No.
I must obey destiny.
Akton!
We'll carry you.
Go.
It's your duty.
You must live.
I can't.
I can't leave you.
You're the only human-like friend I ever had.
I don't understand. You never die.
Stella, Stella.
I've accomplished the mission.
Yes, but I..
Others are coming.
Even as I speak they'll rescue you.
Don't worry.
I'll live forever.
Now go.
Go.
Father!
We must leave at once.
48 seconds left to the explosion.
We've got to get out of here.
It's true father.
The Count has mined the planet with nuclear charges.
We're all about to die.
You know something, my boy?
I wouldn't be emperor if I didn't have some powers at my command.
Imperial battle-ship!
Holt..
..the flow of time.
In the space of 3 minutes
Every molecule on this planet will be immobilized.
But after the third minute
The green ray loses it's power.
Time will flow once again.
And everything will explode.
Three minutes are enough, father.
Now, the Count believe that we are dead.
That our armies have dispersed.
And that we have no leader.
He is supremely confident that he can overcome us with the greatest of ease.
Well then.
Now is the time to surprise him.
We will attack his headquarters before his fleets can join him.
If we succeed in this we could save billions of lives.
Gather together all our legions.
Sir!
And order the attack.
By sunset,
I'll be the new Emperor.
And I will be the master of the whole universe.
Kill them!
Enemy arriving with torpedoes.
Prepare for attack.
Kill! Kill!
Over there.
We've got them, father.
It's working
Kill!
Kill!
Kill them!
Let's squad. Come on
Over there, quickly.
Now let's give the Emperor a great reception.
Put in use the mightiest weapon.
The doom-machine.
Send it off to towards the Emperor's capital world and destroy the emperor's imperial planet.
Zarth-Arn!!
Yeah!
It's over.
We're finished.
We've lost.
No.
No, there's still a way.
There's one solution left.
I'm afraid we're forced to use it.
What?
Starcrash!
Four dimensional attack.
Yes!
If we can re-enter space at the precise moment the impact of surprise upon the Count will be so overwhelming that he cannot halt us.
But father, there is not a weapon powerful enough.
Oh yes, there is.
The floating city.
The floating city.
Yes, yes I know.
Although we destroy it's hope, it's future..
..I'm afraid we must sacrifice it.
By setting it towards the Count's fortress.
It's our only way.
Now you must help me.
Both of you.
Go!
And direct it's course.
Zoltan!
Yes, my-lord.
Now set the doom-machine against the imperial space station itself.
How long will it take?
15 minutes.
The set it in motion.
I want to wipe out the Emperor from the whole of the universe.
Yes, my-lord.
When do we reach the floating city?
In less than 2 minutes.
Right. I'll check the docking facility.
Right!
Everything checks out OK.
Look!
The floating city.
Already evacuated.
The technicians have already set the charges and freed the atomic engines.
If everything goes smoothly
I'll try to eject myself as soon as I re-enter space.
But surely I'll come with you!
No, no, no!
It's more important that you stay here to rescue me once this is all over.
Alright.
I'll stay.
But I cannot let you go alone.
In fact our best scientists have spent the last few hours reconstructing an old friend of yours.
Elle!
You can't keep a good robot down.
This is incredible, they rebuild you.
But how?
You look marvelous.
Very carefully.
And they used the latest components.
I feel like a new machine.
Go now. Quickly!
The survival of our galaxy is in your hands.
This will take us directly to the control-room.
We have a lot to do in a very short time.
Get ready to ease out of orbit.
This doesn't make you nervous, does it?
I've never flown a city before.
Well, leave it to me.
Build up maximum energy.
We must leap through the very heart of the stars.
Prepare to transit. 8 degrees.
Ok. I'm ready.
My-lord!
Yes Ellrik?
A floating ship is about to crash into us.
What?
Zoltan!
Yes my-lord.
Destroy the floating ship approaching us.
It can't be done.
It's too close.
There it is. Dead-ahead.
Alright!
The Count's fighters.
We've got to evade them.
All systems prepare for full power.
Let's lock in these controls.
Move it out. Quick.
Right!
Let's go!
Come back, you fools.
You cowards.
Come back and fight.
My-lord?
Yes!
Come, or you'll be destroyed.
You stay here.
Go!
Let's get out of here or there won't be enough left of me to put back together.
You can bet on that!
Circuits, don't fail me now.
Zarth-Arn!! Zarth-Arn!!
It's Simon. Simon!
We're over here.
Stella. Stella!
And welcome home.
Stella!
Simon!
Ah Stella.
Simon.
Is that so.
Well..
It's done
It's happened.
The stars are clear.
The planets shine.
We've won.
Oh, some dark force no doubt
Will show it's face once more.
The wheel will always turn.
But for now it's calm.
And for a little time..
..at least..
..we can rest.

Come on in.

I'm very pleased to meet you.

What did you do?
- [ Mary Whimpering ]
- Oh, I'm sorry.
[ Whimpering, Gagging ]
Well, I-I work at Lapelle's factory.
I'm...
I'm a printer.
Hen-Henry's very clever at printing.
Yes, he sounds very clever.

I thought I heard a stranger.
We've got chicken tonight.

They're new!
I'm Bill.
Hello. I'm Henry.
Henry's at Lapelle's factory.
Oh, printing's your business, huh?
Plumbing's mine. Thirty years.
I've seen this neighborhood change from pastures... to the hellhole it is now.

The-The girls have heard this before... but 14 years ago...
I had an operation on my arm here.
Doctors said I wouldn't be able to use it.
"Well, what the hell do they know?" I said.
And I rubbed it for a half hour every day... and I got so as I could move it a little.
And then I got so as
I could turn a faucet.
And pretty soon, I had my arm back again.
Now I can't feel a damn thing in it.
All numb.
I-I... I-I'm afraid to cut it, you know?
Mary usually does the carving, but... maybe tonight you'll do it, Henry.
All right with you?
Of course.
I'd be happy to.
Do I just, uh... just cut them up like regular chickens?
Sure, just cut 'em up like regular chickens.

I love Mary.
Henry, I asked you if you and Mary had sexual intercourse.
Well, I don't... I don't think that's any of your business.
Henry!
I'm sorry.
You're in very bad trouble if you won't cooperate.

Mary!

I'm too nervous.
There's a baby. It's at the hospital.
Mom!
And you're the father.
But that's impossible. It's only been...
Mother, they're still not sure it is a baby.
It's premature, but there's a baby.
After the two of you are married, which should be very soon... you can pick the baby up.

Come on, boys.
Hey, Captain, why the haste?
The city will not vanish.
It is not the city of Charak he wishes to see, but someone who dwells within.
After a long voyage it's good to stretch one's legs.
The only good thing about this port is the inn of Abu Jamil.
I have been dreaming of his roasted sheep's eyes.
- And I of the eyes of his daughter.
- You're dreaming of more than her eyes.
- Captain, my mouth is dry.
- Let's sample the wines of Charak.
- My thirst is of a thousand men.
- If you drink, you'll go no further.
- Remember the last time?
- You were stripped of your possessions!
Because of that I added four more eunuchs to the population.
Allah be with you.
All the paradise I seek is here.
Who wants anything more?
I shall stay behind.
All silent, no sound, no lights...
A city of ghosts.
- Why is the gate closed?
- Curfew is not until midnight.
No sentries about.
Ho there! Captain of the watch!
Open the gate!
- Wake, wake, wake, wake!
- It's Sinbad, friend of caliph Kassim!
And a better friend to the Princess Farah!
- Captain Sinbad.
- You know me?
I am a merchant. I hope to purchase some of the cargo you'll unload tomorrow.
No one is admitted to Charak after sunset.
- But why?
- The plague. Many have died.
Every time we reach this port some misfortune strikes us!
- The caliph Kassim and his sister?
- They're well. But he's not caliph yet.
I was told in Jerash that
Kassim's father died three months ago.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
- We'd better return to the ship.
- Yes, let's sell our cargo elsewhere.
I'm not leaving Charak until I see Princess Farah and Kassim.
- Is there another way into the town?
- No.
But if you wish to take the risk you may enter at daybreak.
Until then I can offer to relieve your disappointment.
My tent has wine, food and music.
My people are your servants.
Please, be welcome.
Come.
Hassan, don't drink!
The wine is poisoned. Help Aboo-Seer.
Who are you?
Why have you tried to poison us?
From the depths of the earth,
I command you: Arise!
Destroy them!
Kill Sinbad!
Everyone back to the ship!
Captain Sinbad! ...Wait.
Princess Farah!
Quickly.
Praise to Allah that I found you.
I must talk to you.
Not here, not now.
And no going back that way.
Come with me.
Keep rowing back to the ship!
Keep rowing, keep rowing!
Make for the open sea!
- Hoist the mainsail... do it!
- But the shoals, Captain.
We will risk them, there is a full moon.
We'll lie offshore and not return until daybreak.
- You will go back?
- At dawn.
Warm yourself.
Here, take this.
Drink this.
You were searching for me. Why?
I was told of your return.
I need help desperately.
- My brother is in great danger.
- Prince Kassim? I owe him my life.
A spell has been cast upon him.
My uncle Balsora will tell you.
- Why not you?
- I beg of you, do not leave Charak!
- Trust me for my brother's sake.
- For him I would risk my life.
For you... I would give it.
- I was told there was plague.
- Not true.
Balsora rules the city by day... but by night fear rules Charak.
- People whisper of witchcraft.
- How can I help?
- You will find a way.
- Come... lie down.
- I prayed every day for your return.
- It's been almost a year.
- I was not willing to give up the sea.
- Nor I my life at court.
- Now I've decided to live on land.
- And I to live at sea.
I have returned to Charak to ask Kassim for your hand. Will you consent?
Willingly.
But only when my brother is able to stand before you and give his consent.
- When he is himself again.
- Himself?
After my father's death,
Allah protect his soul...
The astrologers had decided that the first full moon would be auspicious -
- for the coronation of my brother.
On the day of the ceremony, the procession began, -
- but even as the crown was being placed upon his head...
Lie back.
It was the last time I saw him as the Kassim I've known all my life.
Young, handsome... a true prince.
You talked of a spell...
- Or has he fallen victim to the plague?
- Worse than a thousand plagues!
Do not talk of it now.
Hassan, where is the Captain?
- What is it?
- His Excellency is here!
The Vizier Balsora.
Ask the princess to come on deck.
- Excellency.
- Captain... welcome again to Charak.
There she is... may Allah's name be exalted.
I prayed that Princess Farah might reach you safely last night.
- Has she told you?
- Yes, this morning.
But is it true, Excellency?
Let's go on board.
My beloved child.
Praise be to Allah you are safe.
Hassan, food and drink for our guests.
The rest of you, back to work.
- You have told him of our misfortune.
- But is it true, Excellency?
Tragically, horribly.
We have consulted all the wisest men and skilled doctors.
- They can do nothing.
- Come. Sit down.
You have travelled to many lands, help us.
- Perhaps there is someone somewhere.
- I will do all in my power to help.
But this requires skills far greater than mine.
It needs an understanding of the black arts, a great alchemist, a magician.
Wait... Yes, I have heard of such a man, if he still lives.
- Who?
- A Greek.
Some say the wisest man in the world.
His name is...
- Hassan, you remember.
- Melanthius! The hermit of...
- Maroof?
- Casgar.
A remote haunted island.
- Have you been there?
- No.
His deeds are legendary, but he may not even exist.
The island is ringed with deadly reefs.
- You must take us to him.
- It would be dangerous.
I cannot allow you to go.
Unless Prince Kassim is crowned before the passing of seven moons, -
- he will lose forever his right to be caliph.
- Melanthius is our only hope.
- Some say he's mad.
The island savages eat human flesh and worship him.
I will send treasure.
Gold and precious jewels for you, your crew and Melanthius, -
- if only he can restore my nephew.
Should I undertake this voyage, it would not be for gold or jewels, -
- but for a treasure far more precious.
Oh, my beloved son.
May Allah preserve you.
Keep those horses steady!
- Who is that?
- Zenobia, my stepmother. She hates me!
- She was not at court.
- My mother died when I was born.
It is said Zenobia is a witch and willed her death.
Allah protect us! Why is she here?
Be on your guard, Sinbad, she's more dangerous than a scorpion!
Queen, may Allah's blessings be on thee.
We meet at last, Captain.
What brings you back?
To deliver my cargo... and to visit my friend Kassim.
- And his sister?
- I am bound by love to them both.
I intend to ask the caliph Kassim for the hand of Princess Farah.
There's no caliph to consent to your marriage.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
Nor is he likely to be.
I have been told of the events at the coronation.
I shall help if I can.
Kassim is beyond help.
Do not be blinded by love.
Balsora must be made to understand no one can help him.
- I shall tell him.
- Do not provoke her!
Why do you interfere?
You can do nothing for Kassim.
- Captain Sinbad can help us.
- I implore you, be silent.
What can you do -
- when they've consulted all the wise men, doctors, priests, astrologers?
- There may be another.
- No one! Abandon this false hope.
- Kassim is doomed forever.
- You lie. You want him doomed.
Within the passing of seven moons, if Kassim is not crowned caliph, -
- he will lose his right forever.
You bewitched him.
You want your son Rafi to be caliph!
Let me cut the smile from her face!
Let me go!
You'll bring an eternal curse on us -
- if you draw one drop of blood from any member of the royal family.
It's only for that she hasn't murdered Kassim!
As cunning as a snake, as malicious as a shark. Rafi will never be caliph!
- There is no one to prevent it.
- Melanthius will prevent it.
Melanthius is a myth and his powers are a legend. He does not exist.
We shall soon discover if the myth and the legend exist. We sail tonight.
My beloved, may your days always be blessed.
Sail for Rhodes or Tripoli, you'll find richer cargo there.
Set sail in search for Melanthius and you'll set a course for damnation!
Aboo-seer, Hassan, Bahadin.
Prepare the ship for sea.
Order your men to bring treasure for Melanthius.
We sail for Casgar.
One thing I advise...
Set a careful watch on Zenobia.
I will have my men watch her castle by day and by night.
Zabid will be in command.
He's the best soldier I have.
My son, Sinbad has agreed to help them. We must act quickly.
He has taken them to the Isle of Casgar to consult the great sage Melanthius.
- Is the heart ready?
- Yes.
You said no one can help Kassim.
Exquisite, my son.
If Melanthius truly lives, he is the one person who could.
You promised me. I am to be caliph. You swore Kassim would never inherit Charak!
- I shall prevent it.
- How?
Sinbad has a ship, a crew.
Balsora has the palace guards.
We shall have other forces at our command.
More powerful than a palace guard and a lovesick sea Captain and his crew.
That... will be our army.
Quickly as you can.
We must be away before nightfall.
- Take that box in my cabin.
- Carefully, I implore you!
It's a baboon!
What a beautiful specimen.
Get back to work or I'll make baboons of you!
Does he do any tricks, Princess?
There, there...
They mean no harm.
O brave and proud bull -
- whose mighty heart my son has fashioned of purest gold.
Beat... with the power as only I command you.
I made it perfect in every detail.
O mighty Abu Salem... you who rule over a thousand devils, -
- by all the fires of hell and darkness, -
- give strength and life to this your creature.
Minaton... Minaton...
Perfect!
A colossus of bronze... and mine to command.
- Hear anything?
- Nothing.
Keep awake! Orders are to keep a watch on Zenobia's castle.
Or I'll slit your throat.
The wind is dying.
A baboon that can play chess?
Go away!
- He's frightened of you.
- I'm frightened of him.
He attacked me.
Baboons can turn savage, you know.
He is not savage!
I command you to go away.
Is he a gift for the wise man of Casgar to play chess with?
Go away!
Hassan, get back to your work.
- But Captain, the beast was playing...
- ...chess, he has beaten me twice.
He is not really a baboon.
He was transformed by the black arts of Queen Zenobia's witchcraft.
He is... Prince Kassim.
Can you be certain that it is not the princess -
- who has been bewitched to believe this animal is a prince?
He is my brother.
Look!
I am Kassim.
Now do you believe?
What is it?
What could it be?
A ship that moves without sails!
He seems to be rowing for six men.
Come on, let's try to get aboard.
Hurry, it's moving out to sea.
A fishing boat.
Spies of Balsora!
Minaton...
Wheel head into them.
It's Zenobia!
For the love of Allah, row!
Row, will you!
Row, you thickheads, row!
It's witchcraft!
- Save yourselves!
- Ram them, I said. Ram them!
Mercy! Save me!
Minaton... Minaton.
Wait... wait!
And now for Casgar.
North by north-east.
I see nothing.
Breaker ahead!
The rocks and the reefs will be invisible.
It'll be impossible to land.
- I have an excellent idea.
- Yes?
Let's turn back.
- Lower the rowing boat.
- Aye aye, Captain.
Hassan, keep up!
Stay close together, move!
Rest.
How can you be sure where to find Melanthius?
This is a path.
There are tracks. Signs.
Forward, men!
There!
A great pillar.
- Must be a holy place.
- Built by a people of great skill.
- What can it be?
- A temple perhaps.
It seems to be carved out of solid rock.
Could be there is treasure in it.
Could be the castle of Melanthius!
Melanthius! Melanthius!
I will see if anyone is there.
- They'll kill us!
- Run for the wall!
They will not harm you now.
Have you been shipwrecked?
No, my ship is anchored safely.
I am Captain Sinbad.
Only those who were wrecked have landed here before.
But the Casgar people always found them first.
We seek the wise man known as Melanthius.
Does he truly exist?
- Does he live on this island?
- Why do you seek him?
It is a matter of great urgency and importance.
Go!
Go, I said!
This is Princess Farah from the distant city of Charak.
I am Dione.
- Come.
- But Melanthius... does he exist?
Follow me.
Truly incredible!
A magnificent city.
But completely deserted.
Who built it all?
- The ancestors of the natives.
- What happened to them?
They became too civilised and destroyed each other.
Is that where the savages live?
Those are the tombs of their forefathers.
- And those buildings to the right?
- Tombs of kings.
There is someone there.
Is that the great Melanthius?
Yes, father... I will.
Melanthius will see you.
- How did you?
- My father taught me.
He calls it "telepathia". A Greek word for communication of the mind.
Come, follow me.
- Master Melanthius.
- You're a brave man, Captain Sinbad.
And a remarkable navigator to have landed on Casgar safely.
Only for that have I agreed to see you.
Well, thank you... but I still don't understand how you know who I am.
The mind is an extraordinary thing.
Thought is transferable.
It can travel through space, even to the stars.
But the method needs time, patience and a skilful daughter.
What have you got in there?
Tell me.
- It's a cage holding...
- Wait! Don't tell me.
It's an arboreal anthropoid of the genus papio.
- No, it's a baboon!
- That's what I said, a baboon.
- What a dear little fellow.
- Careful!
He can be savage with everyone but the princess.
As a species they are aggressive and of low intelligence.
- He trusts only me.
- He looks so unhappy, poor creature.
Careful!
- It is the baboon about whom...
...you wish to see me. Yes, I know.
I suggest we continue below in my laboratory, out of the sun.
You claim it can write and play chess?
It, my brother, was a brilliant chess player from the age of seven.
Dione, fetch me a mirror.
As a scientist and alchemist
I know that metals can be transformed, -
- but as a philosopher...
Easy, fellow, easy.
I can also believe in the possibility of
...metaphysical change.
Thank you, Dione.
Let him see his face.
Go on!
He's weeping.
By all the gods!
A true baboon would have attacked its reflection, thinking it an enemy.
It would not have recognised itself and been moved to grief.
I am very happy to meet you,
Prince Kassim.
The oars...
Rafi, what has happened?
The oars are smashed.
It will take hours to repair. Quickly!
Sinbad found a way through.
Whatever drug or elixir it was that this woman...
Zenobia.
Whatever it was she used is the most powerful black magic -
- and is beyond my knowledge.
You see, unfortunately, time is on her side.
Perhaps the prince would like some of these.
Real apes are mostly vegetarian.
- How does he like his fruit?
- He does. He likes them.
I thought he would.
- Dione, where is the mint tea?
- Coming, father.
I brought him something.
Bananas... he likes those.
I'll serve the tea.
What did you mean when you said that time was on the side of Queen Zenobia?
The longer that transformation is delayed, the more likely -
- Kassim is to lose those human qualities that remain to him.
Then there is no hope for my brother?
Now, wait...
There was a time when men knew how to combat this form of black witchcraft.
A nation with an intelligence far superior to anything we know today.
They knew the secret of transforming matter.
Dione, help me find the Arimaspi scrolls.
The Arimaspi?
Yes, Archimedes of Syracuse, a very dear friend of mine.
He based many of his inventions on principles originally developed -
- by Arimaspi mathematicians.
Here they are!
Invaluable manuscripts... Where are they?
I've found them.
Yes, these are the ones.
Clear the table.
These scrolls are more than two thousand years old.
- There we are.
- What do they say?
This first one... will be of special interest to you, Captain.
It's sailing directions.
The first written authority.
The only way to restore Kassim is to undertake a journey to their country?
A journey to Hyperborea, the land of the Arimaspi, -
- is the only possible way of restoring Prince Kassim.
These scrolls confirm the legend.
It tells of a warm and green valley at the northernmost point of the world -
- surrounded by wide seas of ice.
There in the valley of Hyperborea, the Arimaspi built a shrine.
The shrine of the four elements:
Earth, fire, air and water.
Within that shrine is the source of all their extraordinary power.
This power enabled them to preserve their valley against the glacier -
- and to change or transform the nature of matter.
I have been experimenting with a similar power.
- Is there truly such a valley?
- Beyond a doubt.
Then how soon can you be ready to sail?
The journey would be impossible!
It's the coldest region in the world!
Cold, certainly. Difficult and dangerous, perhaps, but not impossible.
We have you to interpret the scrolls.
I'm too old!
Besides there's so little time.
Come with us, Melanthius.
It can't be this noble prince shall spend the rest of his days in a cage.
The shrine is his one chance. You're the only one that can lead us there!
Please, say you will.
- Where did you find that?
- With the scrolls.
The key! The only means of opening the door to the shrine.
Hyperborea... to visit the shrine, examine the very source of life.
Archimedes would split himself with envy.
Now, everyone, stand well back!
Imagine that power a million times greater used not for evil, but for good.
That is what the Arimaspi have left us!
Yes, I will go with you.
- Thank you!
- Yes, by all the gods, I will.
No way of reading the sun.
Cloud and fog.
Hurry, hurry!
Listen!
They are leaving!
Hurry! We must follow them.
With a following wind to drive us, we should be many leagues into the...
And into the Western Ocean before the next full moon.
- Why not sooner?
- Not possible.
Time is our enemy on all counts!
At the moment Kassim is still in possession of certain human qualities.
The longer the transformation is delayed, -
- the more he'll revert to a baboon's natural behaviour.
More aggressive, savage, dangerous.
He may never be Kassim again.
We are under full sail.
I can do no more.
It is believed that there is a swift ocean current due north -
- across the Casgars.
North! They're moving north towards the Celtic Isles, but why?
We should be close to Sinbad's ship.
Keep a lookout.
I must know what advice the Greek gave them.
I must know what they mean to do.
I can't!
It was powerful enough to transform Kassim.
I must know.
Now... by Hecate -
- and all the secrets of darkness and forces of hell.
Come!
Captain Sinbad!
Is there no way of increasing our speed?
A ship can only sail as fast as the wind allows.
I'll have to consult the chart again...
Now the moon is on the wane.
No, no, no...
If you study my design, -
- you'll see there's more curve in the runners. The snow will be deep.
But I have never seen snow, Master.
Here, let me try it.
I shall join you in a few minutes.
Maroof, the chart!
Here, sharpen this.
Bahadin, more ropeties for the sledges.
The cargo nets will need to be prepared.
Everything as strong, but as light as possible.
Hassan, I told you to get that knife sharpened!
No, you must try.
You can do better, you know you can.
No, Kassim, not like that.
The other way around.
Like that.
Very well, as you're so bad-tempered, no more writing today.
Baboon!
Kassim, be quiet.
Your friend is very disobedient today.
- Please, Kassim, I'm trying to work!
- Will you be still!
Father, why is he behaving like that?
Be careful.
In the cage, in it!
Well, well, well. And what by Zeus and all the gods have we got here?
- And who?
- Zenobia.
I thought as much.
- But how?
- Never mind how.
Be careful.
Remember she's a witch, and dangerous.
Put me down! Let me go!
Don't hold me!
Don't hold me!
How dare you!
Captain... the glass jar there on the shelf.
It's like trying to hold on to a scorpion. Dione, clear the table.
Captain, put the jar down over there.
Make a space.
- No wonder Kassim was so violent.
- You should have left her to him.
No, Princess, no.
I want to interrogate her.
I suggest that whatever power she has used -
- to transport herself here and change her size -
- is similar in power and property to that which transformed Kassim.
But what is it and where is it?
Leave her in my charge.
I will try to extract it from her.
You must take every care.
A confrontation with evil could be dangerous.
Captain, take the princess and Dione up on deck.
Come with me.
Now then, mistress...
What powers have you used to shrink yourself?
- I will never tell you.
- Oh dear.
I despise brutality, -
- but at this present moment
I'm prepared to reject compassion.
The sting of this insect can be fatal to the strongest, -
- but to someone of your size...
Then answer my questions and quickly!
What are you searching for here on this ship?
These perhaps?
Or this?
How could you know of their existence?
When will you decide to return to your proper shape and size? And how?
Something of unique power.
The power that might be used to return
Prince Kassim to his human form -
- and make our journey to the Arimaspi unnecessary.
The Arimaspi!
Where is it? And in what form?
A liquid? A powder?
My locket! ...Gone!
You've dropped it, haven't you?
Now, where would it be?
Kassim... have you seen it?
Here it is.
It's mine, it's mine.
It belongs to me!
It's smashed, the liquid's evaporating.
There's not much left.
- Take care, the liquid is precious.
- Evidently.
I believe it is the very stuff you used to transform Kassim into an animal.
Perhaps there's not enough left to retransform him. I must test it.
- Yes, on our friend here.
- No, that's mine! I need it!
Will he be tempted?
There's a good fellow.
Lap it up, that's the way.
No, no, there's not enough!
Be silent!
By all the gods!
Kill! Kill the Greek!
Get away from me!
Transformed... the locket!
Get back!
- It's a mad bee!
- What is it?
It's not a bee. It's a mosquito!
What a mosquito!
The bird is getting away!
Kill the bird first.
We need the locket.
Praise be to Allah that you're unhurt.
Alas,
I underestimated the power of Zenobia.
I fear I've thrown away a chance for Kassim. I am profoundly sorry.
You were right, Princess.
We should have left her to Kassim.
Try to calm him, Dione.
He's becoming more savage. Best to keep him locked in his cage from now on.
Safe... You are safe.
Is there enough?
Yes, by all the gods of the underworld, there must be!
Not enough! Not enough!
If only I had seen more.
Memorised more, recorded it into my brain.
- A valley.
- At the end of the world.
And here: The shrine of the legends.
The healing shrine.
We must let Sinbad show us the way.
And then I shall find the means to prevent Melanthius from interfering.
Come, help me.
Ahoy!
Ice! Ice ahead!
- Where away?
- Dead ahead. Icebergs!
At last!
- Will it be soon now?
- We must sail north for four more days.
The less distance to cover on foot the better. Anything to gain time.
The fourth full moon.
Two degrees port!
Look at them.
One column of that on top of us and we'd sink like a ship of lead.
The entrance to the tunnel is somewhere there.
If we could enter safely, our journey will be all but over.
Sinbad, there!
Exactly as described in the scrolls.
Hassan, fetch me the chart.
- The tunnel leads directly to the shrine.
- It'll crack the boat like a walnut!
We must take the longer route.
There's less than three moons left.
If only we could've entered the tunnel.
We'll never make headway against this.
It's getting thicker every hour.
The hull must split if we go further.
Maroof... load up the sledge.
Throw up the ropes...
Quickly!
Keep moving, don't stop!
Pull! Keep pulling.
- It's easier to abandon it!
- Keep moving.
The ice is no match for a boat of bronze.
- And Sinbad?
- Perhaps smashed, drowned or frozen.
Bahadin!...
What could it be?
What is it?
Look, it's beginning to crack!
I'll get the others!
On your feet! Seize anything you can!
Spears, axes, anything!
Melanthius, protect Dione and the princess!
A giant walrus! We must stop it before it reaches the camp!
Hit the eye! The eye!
Attack!
Get the cargo net.
Careful, Maroof!
Protect the supplies!
Get the cargo net!
Unravel it. This way. Quickly!
Open it. Spread it out.
Push, go on, push!
He's pulling us!
Pull away from him.
He's pulling us!
Help me.
Cut me loose.
Sinbad, my foot!
Cut me loose.
Hassan, your knife!
Cut me loose, cut me loose!
Too bad you couldn't hold him.
I should've liked to examine him.
- Walrus giganticus, prehistoric!
- I'm sorry. Next time I'll try harder.
Are you hurt?
It is said a man has only one life.
Now I have two.
I owe them both to Captain Sinbad.
I've never seen a black man turn white before.
No sign of a tunnel between the cliffs.
The chart in the scroll is precise.
There is an entrance -
- and I mean to find it.
Minaton, sail on!
We've found it! We've found it!
Look, it's the aurora, see?
Hyperborea just beyond the hills.
And that strange glittering light?
The Arimaspi call it the gift of the winter Apollo.
We call it aurora borealis.
And there, directly below the aurora, -
- the Valley of the Shrine.
He's turning carnivorous.
I hope it is not too late for Kassim.
He no longer responds to human speech or contact.
Except for Dione.
Take them, Maroof.
Protect the women.
Sinbad, stand still!
All of you, don't make any sudden moves.
He's as frightened of us as we are of him.
- I'm more frightened.
- I'm twice more frightened.
Sinbad... lower your sword and step back slowly.
Do it!
What sort of evil monster is it?
It's not a monster.
It's one of man's ancestors.
They're not evil.
They're called troglodytes.
I've got the skull of one of them in my laboratory.
He's coming closer!
Dione... speak to him.
Gently...
They have no idea of language, -
- but these primates were known for their gentleness with females.
There, there...
No harm.
We mean no harm.
Friends.
We are friends.
Dione, be careful!
Kassim, he means no harm.
Perhaps he might be able to help us.
Dione, Princess...
Persuade Kassim to bring the trog over here. I've something to show him.
Bring trog.
Bring him over there.
There... to my father.
Kassim, I want the troglodyte to look at this.
The face drawn on the scrolls!
It marks the entrance to the valley, the gate to the shrine.
Where, where?
Hyperborea!
By all the gods, he's done it!
Hassan, Maroof, the weapons.
There! There it is!
The entrance to the tunnel of ice!
The way to Hyperborea.
We shall be there first!
The tunnel, Minaton.
I will light the torches.
- Farah, are you all right?
- Yes.
There! Look over there!
- The last of the Arimaspi?
- Who can say?
Minaton.
Listen!
The boat is still moving!
There's some extraordinary force pulling us like a mighty magnet, -
- drawing us to the shrine.
The face from the scrolls...
The gate to the shrine.
Come on.
Trog seems frightened of the gate.
- Frightened of what lies beyond, maybe.
- Why should he be afraid?
Like all primitives, he's afraid of the unknown.
Afraid of what he can't understand.
Help me move the bar.
It's no use. We cannot move it without blocks and ropes.
Trog will help us.
He must help.
The shrine of the four elements.
- See, it exists! A reality.
- Hope for Kassim... at last.
The arch!
The boat is stopping.
Wait.
Go on, up into the sunlight.
There it is.
Come!
At last you'll have a use for that precious key of yours, -
- if you can find a lock to fit it.
We'll find it.
The scrolls haven't been wrong yet.
We must look for an opening somewhere there among the rocks.
We must be close.
Hurry, Rafi!
Nothing... nothing.
I could not find an entrance.
We must make an entrance.
Rafi, Minaton, stay clear!
Spirits of the underworld, infuse this potion with your powers!
What was that?
- It's like an earthquake.
- There can only be one possible answer.
The witch.
Zenobia.
- He'll never break through.
- He must! He must!
He must!
Minaton, pull!
He's done it!
He's done his work.
The wall is breached!
- Look there!
- Zenobia's creation.
A bull's head, but a...
...giant's body!
Almighty God, defend us.
They shouldn't have forced an opening.
The power of the shrine is threatened!
The atmosphere inside is destroyed!
This key is useless!
Perhaps there's still time, but we must be swift!
Drawn down from the crown of Apollo itself.
The guardian of the shrine...
The ice is melting.
Look out!
- We must act at once!
- The cage... and the chains!
Just as described in the scrolls.
We must put Kassim in the cage and pass him through the column of light.
Sinbad, the chains!
See if they still operate.
- Thank all the gods.
- The gods have abandoned you!
Too late, Sinbad!
Kassim will never be caliph!
Now, Rafi, now!
Not the animal, kill Melanthius!
They are helpless without him.
Sinbad, bring Kassim.
May the gods of the Arimaspi grant us the time!
Bring him up, bring him up!
O great Apollo! All you gods and forces that work for good against evil, -
- help us now! O great mystery, come to our mortal aid!
Reveal your secret!
Lower the cage!
Your Highness.
Prince Kassim...
This way, Your Highness.
Master Melanthius, he made it all possible.
- How shall I ever thank you?
- It's an old debt repaid.
The power of the shrine is failing! We must go! There's not a moment to lose.
The temperature's changing violently.
Be swift or this'll become our tomb!
Zenobia!
She's gone!
Stand back! Get back!
- Come on, let's go!
- No, not yet.
Now, move! Move!
Take Dione and the princess back to the gate.
- We shall not leave you!
- Do as I say!
If I do not join you within an hour, then head for Charak -
- before the seventh moon is full.
Maroof is dead.
They're coming!
Where's Maroof?
Come on, we must not waste a moment.

Look, I found it!
15 years ago, - a giant gorilla was seen in small town at the Himalayas.
The villagers lived in peace for years.
Except the earthquake during that year.
If we'll find the gorilla - and sent it to Hong Kong - we will be rich and famous.
The animal is long and very strong.
It's not easy to catch.
But it's still animal.
With our intelligence  - we can win it.
And even if we don't catch it alive, we can use it for experiments.
And we'll get lots of money.
- That's right.
I know scientist named Chen Zhengfeng.
Also he want's to find the gorilla.
He's been down after he broke up with his girlfriend.
Zhengfeng...
Have you already decided after our conversation, - will you lead our expedition?
Have you thought about it?
- All right.
I'll come with you.
Let's go to look.
Let's go.
Zhengfeng.
Come here.
I'll introduce them.
Good day.
These are Mr. Chen and Mr. Lin.
Expedition team has 6 members.
Welcome.
And we hope that you find that gorilla soon.
Keep in touch.
Look.
What's going on?
Let's help at pushing!
Hurry up.
Let's continue.
We haven't seen anyone - during last days.
We have long journey still ahead.
Strange!
Why the village is abandoned?
Is anyone here?!
Elefants are coming this way!
Elefants.
Hurry, run!
They have gone already.
Get up.
Let's move on.
Let's go.
Zhengfeng, you have been quiet - since you came here.
Are you all right?
We are at the same boat.
And we are close friends.
What's wrong with you?
Tell us.
And we'll see if we can help.
It's not a big deal.
Is it about your girlfriend?
I know you broke up.
I have 2 intimate friends in Hong Kong.
One is my ex-girlfriend.
She loves singing, and other one is my brother.
He's TV-producer.
He's a real businessman.
He wants to be famous some day.
We had everything fine, - but one day when I came home -
I catched my brother and her together.
Zhengfeng.
You two.
Why? Why he?
I didn't anticipated.
I didn't know that you two...
I really didn't know.
Please believe me, I really didn't know.
Zhengfeng.
After that - you decided to lead the expedition, right?
Forget the whole thing.
There are lots of nice girls.
After we have catched the gorilla, - you'll be world famous.
You'll have many women.
Let's got to sleep, tomorrow is a long day.
It's quicksand!
Don't shoot!
Why not?
Are you okay?
Get the medikit.
Hurry.
Hurry up.
Was that necessary?
Why did you kill him?
Let go of me.
There wasn't reason to save him.
We don't have enough medicine.
I don't wat to waste anything.
- You...
That's enough,
I have had enough already.
Let's go back to Hong Kong.
There is no giant gorilla.
We got screwed!
Calm down.
I'm convinced, that we'll find that gorilla.
We have come so far already.
We can't afford to return, right?
No.
Let's go.
Straight forward.
This track looks fresh!
I believe it's not far from here.
Let's leave it die alone.
Where is everyone?
Stop it.
Wahng, don't hurt me.
Go.
Drink. Drink all.
You are...
Who are you?
I'm Chen Zhengfeng.
I'm looking for giant gorilla.
Don't worry, it's only scratch.
Who are you?
Why you are here?
I...
Where are your parents?
Mon and dad.
They are...
Where are they?
Nearby...
Can you take me to them?
Okay.
Wait a sec.
This way.
Come.
Follow me.
Look.
Dad, mom and me.
Look.
Downpour... aeroplane... accident.
I see, the gorilla has raised you - all these years, right?
Your name is Ah Wei?
Ah Wei... yes.
If you're hungry, let's eat something.
Where's the food?
Follow me.
Jiji.
Good boy.
Go.
Come here.
Let's go.
I'm thirsty.
This is good.
It hurts.
Thank you.
Mister Lu Tien.
Hi.
I'm reporter from the Daily News.
Please sit down.
About your expedition.
How did it go?
We explored all forest.
There is no giant gorilla.
It's probably just a legend.
I heard, that Chen Zhengfeng is still looking for.
Is it so?
Chen Zhengfeng...
He won't survive alone at the jungle.
He's become animal food.
Ah Wei, are you ok?
Ah Wang.
Ah Wei.
I want to take you and Ah Wang - to Hong Kong tomorrow.
We're going on cargo ship.
He listens only you.
What do you think?
Say "yes".
Yes.
Bye.
Jiji.
Come.
Bye, Jiji.
Stop.
Lay down and sleep.
I've been looking for you.
- So have I.
I found giant gorilla and brought it with me.
Let's go look it.
Excellent.
We'll look for biggest cargo ship - and transport it to Hong Kong.
No chains, please.
Let it go, please.
Don't worry, listen.
Gorilla is huge - and strong.
If it'll fly off the handle - and broke its chains, - it'll turn over ship.
It has to be chained.
Don't cry, please.
Zhengfeng,
Ah Wang got chained!
Ah Wang is too strong.
It has to be chained.
We'll release it at Hong Kong.
Come on.
Zhengfeng.
Don't cry, Ah Wei.
I have present for you.
Open it.
We are back in civilization.
You can't wear your costume anymore.
Wear this.
Try it.
Try.
Mister Lu, outrageous!
You should have knocked!
Excuse me,
I have news for you.
I got telegraph from Hong Kong.
Everything is ready.
Giant gorilla will be introduced - at Hong Kong stadium, day after tomorrow.
Tickets got sold out in 3 hours.
Isn't that great news?
Think about, we could take the gorilla - to world tour.
We will be rich.
I don't approve, that we'll - finacially exploit the gorilla.
Zhengfeng, don't forget, - that you signed contract.
You can't violate it.
Besides, contract says, - you'll get 5% of net profits.
I't lot of cash.
Drink with me.
Let's celebrate.
Come.
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.
Gorilla has brought you good luck.
You'll be rich.
Thank you.
Gentle men, champagne.
Enjoy your stay.
I offer.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Captain.
Here's weather report.
Thank you.
What's wrong, captain?
I just got message.
We'll end up to storm within 5 hours.
It's fierce.
I'm going to go through Singapore.
We well sail to Hong Kong - after storm has ended.
Singapore?
Definitely not.
I've already organized show to Hong Kong.
It's day after tomorrow.
All tickets have been sold.
Who will take responsibility over my losses?
ANd what if we shipwreck, - who's then on responsibility?
I'll take the responsibility.
Ship will be fine.
We have to get to Hong Kong on time.
I'll take all the responsibility.
We made a deal, Captain.
If we don't arrive to Hong Kong on time, - your company will make up for my losses.
Is that ok?
Ok, then to Hong Kong.
Ah Wei.
- Zhengfeng.
Ship has drifted to reef, what do we do?
I know.
I'll reverse.
Think up something soon.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wei, come here.
It is dangerous!
Come back, fast!
Ah Wang, push the ship loose!
Harder!
Mom, look.
Giant gorilla is here.
Come look.
That is Connaught Centre,
Hong Kong's tallest building.
You came back, friend?
Are you still mad at me?
You have caused quite headlines!
Totally unbelievable!
It was hard year - living in jungle.
How's it going?
Busy?
Yes.
I'm on show today.
If you have some time, come visit.
Let's see at studio.
I will.
You can meet my brother.
Taxi.
I'm looking for producer Chen Shiyua.
Wait a sec.
Zhengfeng.
You're back.
Like always!
His name is Ah Wei, from indian jungle.
My brother.
Producer, lightning is ready.
We can start.
Ok, take them to studio.
And after the show - we can talk.
Ok.
Mr. Chen,
Miss Wang wants to see you.
Thank you.
It won't take a long.
How are you?
Sit down, please.
It's been while since last time.
I don't know how to address you.
Are you now like my sister?
Please stop.
You...
I was wrong.
My arrogance blinded me then.
I was inappropriate.
I hurted you and me then.
I'm really sorry about it.
Let's not talk about past.
Waht does my brother...
What does he mean to you?
It's over between us.
My brother is still playboy.
I'll talk with him later.
It's not necessary.
Everything is over.
I suffered and felt guilty last year.
That if you had difficulties in the jungle.
I would not have ever forgiven myself.
I prayed for you every day.
Hoping that you would return in one piece.
And there you are.
Will you forgive me?
Do not dwell on it anymore.
Cheer up.
Let's have fresh start.
I'll make it up for you.
Ah Wei.
Zhengfeng.
I'll explain later.
I want to go to Hong Kong Stadium.
Can you take me?
Yes.
Thank you.
You are too proud of.
Because you do not listen to us.
Customers were not satisfied.
We got to trouble because of you, you deserve this.
Stop it.
Ah Wang.
Stop, please.
Move.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang, let's return to the jungle.
Ah Wei, don't cry.
Come with me.
Ah Wang.
Come.
Take a drink.
The giant gorilla has escaped.
Hurry and send your men.
Come.
Ah Wang...
Ah Wang.
Hurry up.
Stay where you are.
Follow me inside.
What's wrong?
Awful, there's a giant gorilla outdoors.
My wife is a gorilla.
What? Who is a gorilla ?
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang, stop!
Don't do it.
Greetings.
Mister.
I know about the giant gorilla.
I will try to lure it to
Wanchai construction site.
It is less populated area.
I'll come quickly to there.
I'm there.
Attention, all units, we need to lure the gorilla - to Wanchai construction site.
Send an armored vehicle unit and wait for my order.
Make checkpoints to largest intersections. Try to stop it.
Shoot the gorilla.
Yes.
Everybody on it.
Okay.
I have a way to control it.
What way?
Girl named Ah Wei.
Gorilla raised her.
If only we can find her, we can control the gorilla.
Where is this Ah Wei now?
- She has escaped.
He is from jungle and dressed in animal skin.
She is easy to find.
- On animal skin!
You were cooperative.
We'll find her together.
Attention, all units.
We are looking for a girl who is wearing an animal skin.
Her name is Ah Wei.
There she is!
Take her down.
They didn't control the gorilla.
We need helicopters.
Focus your all units,
I need all the help.
Blow the gorilla.
Follow it and make sure - you won't hurt citizens.
Everyone to their places.
Fire.
It must be obtained.
Attention, everyone.
It climbs to Connaught Centre.
Bullets don't stop it.
Fill in the roof water tanks with gasoline - and lay bombs.
We will blow it.
The building will be destroyed too.
Doesn't matter.
It is the only option.
Fill the tanks.
- Yes, sir.
Nö.
Don't.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wang.
What now?
Come.
Don't shoot!
Gorilla is crazy.
If we don't kill it, it will destroy Hong Kong.
This is Ah Wei.
Gorilla raised her.
She gets it to calm down.
Really?
I pray for you, do not harm it.
One condition.
Promise me you won't kill it.
I promise.
Are you sure?
I'll keep my word.
Stop shooting.
Stop the shooting now.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang, lower your hands.
Ah Wang.
Let's go back to the jungle.
Ah Wang.
Attention, all units, gorilla has calmed down.
Now is your change.
It must be killed.
We have to.
Yes, sir.
Stop it.
Well done.
It must be killed.
No!
Hurry up!
Explosives unit is ready.
Place the bombs.
And wait for my order.
Yes, sir.
You are setting bombs.
Commander promised me - you wouldn't hurt the gorilla, when it is under control.
We do only our work.
Speak to Commander.
Do not move!
It is useless to defuse.
Tanks are filled with gasoline - and there are bombs everywhere.
It'll explode soon and the gorilla dies.
Shoot it, kill it.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wei.
Let's go, the whole place will explode soon.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wang.
Go away.
Ah Wang.
Ah Wei.
Ah Wang...
Ah Wei, go.
Go down, soon.
Ah Wei.
Now, what about food?
Normal intake has continued for over a week now.
Good. Good.
Any new signs of rejection?
Absolutely none.
The patch of pneumonia has completely cleared up.
What about his blood pressure?
It was a little off yesterday, but today it seems to be completely level.
Oh, excellent. Excellent.
- Any adverse or abnormal symptoms?
- Couldn't be better.
The transplant is a complete success.
Excellent.
Donald, you were right.
He does look fantastic.
We complete the balance of the tests now.
Tomorrow, we'll remove the original head.
You see? He loves me.
Doctor, I wouldn't get too close if I were you.
Don't be absurd, Donald.
He trusts me... and he needs me.
After all, we understand one another
I am the genius that has given him a new life and he, in return, will help me keep mine.
Arterial clamp, please.
Ahh, little more perfusion.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of our 3 operating facilities.
The Kirshner transplant foundation is the only place in the world where such a massive operation can take place.
Dr. Smith, in such a massive transplant, why don't we see more blood?
That's because at this moment, both the patient and the donor organs are hooked up to individual heart-lung machines.
They control the blood flow through those plastic tubes.
Is that Dr. Kirshner on the platform?
Yes, Dr. Kirshner supervises the major transplant operations.
Does he ever operate himself?
No, uh... not anymore.
He developed a severe arthritic condition a year or so ago, and well, it makes surgery quite difficult for him.
Dr. Thomas, x-ray please
Philip, walk me to the door, will you?
Sure, Max.
I'm leaving early today.
Now, the only thing left on the schedule.
Is a kidney transplant, right?
I see no problems there, do you?
I don't.
Well, you and Hersch take care of it, and I'll see you in the morning.
OK.
By the way, that was a pretty good job in there today, you and the team.
Thank you. I didn't think you'd noticed.
I said good. I didn't say excellent.
Are you all right now, doctor?
They're getting worse.
And more frequent.
There must be something we can do.
You know damn well I can't take any drugs.
I must keep my mind alert.
I'm sorry Thomas, but it's difficult.
Come on, boy.
Yes...
Come on.
Gently.
No sudden moves.
Just gently.
Now, Thomas, move easily.
Give him the injection.
Quiet boy.
Attaboy. Easy boy. Easy.
Come on.
All right, Thomas, now, move easy and stay calm.
Behave normally and slowly and just... just as if you're dealing with a child.
I didn't get him! I didn't get him!
Be quiet! Don't run around.
Keep that cage steady!
Damn it, donald! Don't just stand there!
Try him again, get him from the other end!
Watch him, now!
Hold that cage down!
Hold it!
Donald, hold the cage down!
Hold it down!
I can't!
Get around him!
Don't let him get away!
Here, boy! Look out!
He's coming for you!
Oh, no! I'll get him.
Get away from him! Get away from him!
The tranquilizer gun, quickly!
Doctor, are you all right?
Forget about me!
Get him back.
And get him back alive.
I haven't got much time.
Move!
He can't have gotten too far, could he?
Look at that.
This monitor will discard organs that are malfunctioning beyond what the human eye can detect.
Young man, you realize we operate here on a success average of 92%?
Can your machine improve on that?
I'm sorry to interrupt, Dr. Kirshner.
Dr. Williams has arrived.
You asked me to let you know as soon as he got here.
Show him in here, will you?
Dr. Williams?
I instructed the board to hire him without an interview.
He's done some interesting work on rejection prevention.
Well, of course. I've read about him.
He's excellent.
This is Dr. Williams.
Dr. Desmond.
Pleasure meeting you.
Phil Desmond, head of surgery this is Jim Franklyn.
- Hi. How are you?
- Fine.
And this is Dr. Kirshner.
Dr. Kirshner,
I've been looking forward for meeting you, sir, and I'm very happy to be on your staff.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Dr. Williams...
Yes, sir?
How was the trip from minneapolis?
Very pleasant, thank you.
Uh... doctor... since originally hiring you, uh... certain situations which we were depending upon haven't arisen.
Due to budgetary setbacks, we find that we are unable to use your services.
But we signed a contract, and I've already given up my position in Minneapolis.
Miss Davis... check the terms of his contract.
It's for a 6-month trial period at 500 per week.
The board was most generous.
I've been a physician for over 5 years.
I was making much more than that, in Minneapolis.
Oh come now, Dr. Williams.
I didn't mean that at all.
What I meant was, it's just that here we pay our lab men much less.
I'm much more than a lab man, sir.
I'm a doctor.
Let's not bargain, doctor.
What is it you want?
What I wanted was to work with Maxwell Kirshner, one of the foremost transplant specialists in the world.
Why is it you people always put yourself in a position where you... where you don't fit?
But Max, that's not necessary.
Why is it all of a sudden that, uh...
I don't fit?
I'll get some coffee, and we'll... look at this thing some other time.
Yes, why don't you do that?
Yes, uh, I'll do that.
Why don't we stop playing around, doctor?
Things might be different if I were white, right?
Let's put it this way... this is my hospital.
I run it my way.
I hire whom I please... and I don't wish to hire you.
Oh, no.
Let's put it this way... we have a legal and binding contract, and I intend to see you follow it to the letter.
All right, doctor, you'll have your 6 months.
But that will be it!
Report to Dr. Hersch for scheduling.
Thank you.
6 months will be long enough.
I'll watch you, and I'll learn.
That's what I came here for.
And when I've learned what you know,
I'll fit myself in somewhere else.
Max, that wasn't necessary.
What is or what is not necessary in this hospital is my affair.
As you know,
I never allow colored people on my personal staff.
I just got carried away by superficial accomplishments before interviewing the man.
Whether he's black or not, he's an excellent doctor.
Philip, do me a favor, will you?
Cover for me today.
I have some important things to do at home.
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I know.
Call Dr. Desmond.
Tell him it's urgent.
I want to see him here immediately.
Max, what is it?
Hello, Philip.
What's the problem?
My condition is terminal chest cancer.
Prognosis...
I have 2 or 3 weeks to live, at the most.
Why didn't you tell me this?
There was no point in telling you.
You couldn't do anything about it, anyway.
Well, in your own case,
I doubt if you're the best judge.
Let's get you to the hospital and start working.
Donald... show him the x-rays.
That was taken over 3 months ago.
As you can see, the condition was inoperable at that time.
Progression has gone past the lungs and into the pleural cavity and the rib cage.
Organ transplanting would be futile.
Afraid I'll have to agree with you.
Is there anything I can do to make it easier?
Yes, there is.
Donald, show him.
That is not the gorilla's original head.
He's heavily sedated now.
But we have achieved 100% total spinal alignment on the newly transplanted head.
It's impossible.
Is it?
Heart, lungs, kidneys, arms, legs... everything is functioning properly.
Look at this.
Top one.
I kept the original body and the transplanted head alive on 2 separate heart-lung machines.
Well, what do you think?
Absolutely amazing.
Exactly.
Total spinal alignment achieved by using matching electric currents attached to the nerve endings.
I left the 2 heads together for 28 days, until the new one was strong enough to take over.
The removal operation was really quite simple.
I did it myself.
Alone... in 35 minutes.
This could revolutionize the whole profession.
I'll get a paper on it right away.
No, no, no, no.
We've got to go much further.
That's why I need your help.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about science, about genius.
Genius must be prolonged.
Philip, I want to transplant my head on a healthy body.
Well?
Well?
I don't know.
What don't you know?
It hasn't been proven.
Then we'll prove it now.
My genius must be allowed to continue.
Philip, I have nothing, absolutely nothing to lose.
There's no other way for me to live.
I guess there isn't.
Of course, we'll need a donor, perhaps someone with an inoperable brain condition, with a body that cannot be saved, but it's healthy enough to withstand the operation until we can remove the other head.
That won't be easy, Max.
Such a patient only comes along once in a great while.
Perform the operation here, in secret.
The fewer people who know about this, the less our chance of trouble with public opinion.
Philip, you've gotto help me.
Well, as you said, Max, you have absolutely nothing to lose.
No, no. His brain must be totally inoperable.
A cancer patient is out of the question.
Kirshner institute the patient must be able to sustain life for at least 30 to 40 days.
No. I'm sorry.
Now, what does the patient have?
Kirshner institute.
No good, Patricia..
We've had 2 possibilities in the last 4 weeks, and neither matched up.
Oh, I'm sorry, but a cancer patient is out of the question.
Kirshner institute. May I help you?
Yes?
Oh, fine. Bring him in.
Hey Phil, it's been a long time.
Mitch. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
- Anytime.
- Grab a chair.
Thank you.
Since I talked to you yesterday,
I've come up with a few answers.
Oh? Can you help us?
You said it was urgent, so I pulled a few strings for you, and I talked to the governor, and I talked to the attorney general, and, uh... here's the deal.
First, we can't let any of this leak to the press.
We're already having enough trouble with these executions without adding fuel to the fire.
You've got it.
Next, the convict must be under total police security at all times,
And proof of his subsequent death must be certified by a state physician.
Of course, we're assuming some things.
We're assuming that someone on death row will decide to donate his body to science rather than go to the chair.
Well, we can only hope.
Tell me something... just off the record... what's this experiment about?
Transplant, Mitch.
Just another transplant.
Men, listen up
We have a message from the warden.
This is an offer from the office of the lieutenant governor.
"To all men presently on death row.
"We are hereby offering one of you the opportunity "of donating your body to science
"rather than undergo your present sentence
"of death by electrocution
"while the resulting scientific experiment will,
"after a period of 30 days, also result in your death,
"you will at least have the personal satisfaction
"that your life has aided humanity and the scientific world."
Only 60 millimeters of mercury.
What do you think?
Well, if it weren't for our life support systems, he'd be dead now.
As it is I don't know uh...
One day, 4 at the most.
I don't think he'll regain consciousness, which means... that we're going to have to find our donor immediately.
Here am I take my hand if I trip, if I fall won't you help me stand?
All right, Jack.
It's time.
Who might be... don't go easy, Jack.
Jack, let 'em have it.
Jack, give 'em hell!
Jack, you fight 'em all the way!
Just take 'em and bite 'em and gouge 'em dead.
Jack, make 'em drag you in there!
Jack, make 'em work!
Jack, listen, when they kill ya... when they kill ya, they'll know they killed a real man!
Jack!
Bye, Jack.
I wanna try to understand to live right, to give light to my fellow man so long sometimes it's been a crime for the children that are hungry problem is... and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever. Amen.
More power to you, brother.
Jack moss...
It's my duty to carry out the sentence of the court and the law of our state.
Is there anything that you wish to say before sentence is carried out?
Yeah... the Same thing I've been tellin' you guys all the time and you didn't believe me
I'm innocent, and my girl and some friends are close to proving it.
So I've been thinkin', warden.
I think I'd like to donate my body to science after all.
Dr. Desmond?
Sergeant Hacker.
Sergeant. This is Dr. Smith.
How do you do?
This is your volunteer.
There's no way out of here.
Ok, boys, let's go.
Hey, doc, is this gonna hurt?
I beg your pardon?
You're gonna operate, right?
Is this gonna hurt?
No, no, no. You won't feel a thing.
That's good.
'Cause I got what is called a low pain level.
I don't like to get hurt.
We're gonna sedate you right now.
You won't feel any pain.
Oh, that's good.
What are you guys gonna do to me, anyway?
We're conducting a transplant experiment, mr. Moss.
They did explain to you that you won't survive this operation?
They did explain?
Oh, yeah.
Yes, sir.
Big Jack got himself 30 more days.
Then the man's gonna try to pull the switch again.
30 more days... maybe all I need.
Then everybody gonna know big Jack is innocent.
Yes, sir... tried to tell 'em.
Innocent...
Sponge.
Light.
Pair of scissors.
Bulldog clamp.
Scalpel and forceps.

- Captain?
- Thornton, sir.
Christie's my name.
Colonel Wiley, major Williams.
Hello, sir.
I'm very sorry colonel Langston isn't here to greet you, sir.
He was called away to a civil defense meeting, sir.
Excellent job.
I congratulate all of you.
Just remember, complete secrecy.
Ok, Larry, you're on.
What are you watching?
Uh, nothing special.
I was just switching around trying to find something else.
How about making us some coffee?
Yeah, sure, sarge. Anything you say.
Philip.
Max.
Max, I'm here.
Max, listen to me.
We did it.
We transplanted your head.
We did it, Max.
And everything is checking out properly.
Max, it's going to work.
I knew it would.
By god, I knew it would.
I can feel it.
I can breathe with it.
I can feel my hand.
I... I think I'm moving it.
Am I moving it?
Yes, it's moving, Max.
It feels so strong... so magnificent.
Fantastically, beautifully strong.
I think I'm lifting my left arm.
I am lifting it.
I know I am.
Max, we had to make a last-minute decision.
We had no choice.
Is this some kind of a joke?
You were in a terminal coma.
We had nowhere else to turn.
It was our only chance.
If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't have made it.
Let me see him.
There was nothing else we could do.
Is that a fact?
You wouldn't have lived on the life support systems for more than one more day.
Is that a fact?
Breakfast will be along in a few minutes.
Mm, thank you, honey.
Hey, Sam, wake up.
It's breakfast time.
Take your hands off me!
What happened?
What have you guys done to me?
I'm talkin' to you, man.
What have you guys done?
Shut up.
Where's the rest of you?
We are joined together temporarily.
What do you mean?
They've transplanted my head onto your body.
Now will you shut up and get some rest?
We need our rest.
We?
What do you mean, we?
I told you guys I was innocent.
I just needed a little time.
Why'd you guys do this to me?
Why'd you do this to me?!
Easy, easy! Take it easy, moss.
Let me go! Let me go!
Help! Help!
Hold it. I'll take care of this.
Help!
Let me go!
Oh, my god!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I told you I was innocent, man!
Let me go...
I couldn't stop him.
That black bastard, I couldn't stop him.
It's all right doc, just relax.
No harm done.
The incision is fine.
Just take it easy.
I couldn't move the left arm.
He was controlling it.
I couldn't move it.
Takes time, Max. You know that.
Your head won't begin to take control of that body... for 10 to 14 days.
How am I going to... ever control him?
He might do it again.
He could... he could kill me.
No, no. No. He won't.
We'll keep his head locally sedated until then.
When he was out, you only had minor control.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
Now, I'm gonna give you something to make you relax.
Uh! Philip.
Philip, I can feel that.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
It's all right, Max.
We're gonna make it.
Dr. Williams, I've been looking for you.
Dr. Desmond has asked that you meet with him, at Dr. Kirshner's as soon as possible.
And here's the address.
Are you sure he asked for me?
Specifically.
Thank you.
Dr. Desmond. Over there.
Thank you.
Oh, Dr. Williams.
Uh, we'll talk about this later.
Right.
Doctor, I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to talk to you since you started at the hospital.
It's really not necessary.
Well, yes, it is.
I want to apologize.
I mean, for Dr. Kirshner.
See, he's not had an easy life.
Even his childhood was... well, I can certainly sympathize with people who have had a difficult childhood.
Let me put it another way.
It's possible we may be making medical history right here.
We'll know in a week or so.
We've performed a massive transplant.
We're expecting severe rejection problems.
Quite honestly, I could use your help.
Why me?
Because of your anti-rejection techniques.
They could come in handy.
Could mean the difference between success and failure.
You've got the best people from the hospital here.
Now, why me?
And especially here.
Doctor, I understand your problem.
But did you ever stop to think that my views may not be the Same as Dr. Kirshner's?
Now, we're testing 24 hours a day.
You're a good doctor and an excellent lab man.
I need your help.
Will you help me?
Yes, doctor I'll do everything I can to help.
Thank you.
Now, I can't divulge the full nature of the operation as yet.
You'll have enough information to do your job.
I want you to go home, get some things.
The entire staff is living here.
Dr. Hersch will assign you a room.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We have a patch of pneumonia.
That extra decadron is giving us one hell of a problem.
The body just can't fight infection with it.
Cut down the dosage of barbital to the black head.
He's too far under.
We need all the help we can get from him.
Right, doctor. Right away.
You've been working for 16 hours.
Would you like me to get you a relief?
Oh, no, thank you, nurse.
I'll be all right. Thanks anyway.
How's the lymph count?
It's better, much better.
In fact, it's falling slowly.
Good.
We're gonna make it.
Ok. So, uh... when do us here on the outside really get to know what's going on in there?
It won't be long now.
How are we doing?
Well, the pneumonia's finally stable.
No improvement but at least, he's no worse.
Philip, I think we may have a chance.
You're late for the injection, nurse.
I was about to look for you.
Now get going.
Sorry, doctor. I'll get right to it.
Oh!
What the hell is the matter with you, moss?
Get back to bed.
You jive.
Holy shit!
Aagh!
Uhh!
Are you crazy?
You'll never get outta here.
That's what you think.
Just take it easy, lady.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Run, you idiot! Get help!
Help!
Help! Shut up.
Hold it, everybody!
Hold it right there.
Will somebody do something!
Now, I don't wanna hurt nobody, but I will if I have to.
You, soul brother, you got a car?
Yeah. Why?
You're now the chauffeur.
Let's go.
But my keys are in my coat in the closet.
Well, let's get 'em.
Let's go! Let's go!
And the rest of you folks, you just stay inside till we're gone and nobody's gonna get hurt.
Get in the car! You drive.
Jack, come with me. Call the police.
We'll keep track of them.
Come on, Jack!
Williams, stop this car immediately!
By helping him you're making yourself an accomplice.
Why don't you shut up!
Hey, that's telling him, man.
I should have known your kind stick together.
You a doctor? Yeah.
How good a doctor are you?
What do you mean by that?
You done an operation before on a patient that lived?
So far, so good.
Then how about you talking ol' happy face off me here?
Williams, turn this car around immediately. Now!
If you don't do it, then I get rid of him my way.
Williams.
That'd be about as smart as you jumping out of this car.
How is that?
I mean that if you kill him, you'll kill yourself.
The only way to eliminate his head and live is through surgery.
Ok.
We'll just have to figure out a way to do it right, then.
There they are.
Thank god you're slowing down.
Well, we don't want to catch them.
We just want to keep them in sight.
If we get into traffic, there may be a police car around somewhere.
There's a car following us.
Step on the gas.
I'm doing the best I can on this road.
You're gonna get us all killed.
There's a police car up ahead of us.
There's the police.
Hey!
You looking for Jack moss?
You just passed him in a 1969 yellow ford, about 10 seconds away.
They're gonna be coming back soon.
Hit the brakes.
Oh, my god!
Move over!
You're a passenger now.
I'm driving.
It's them. They turned around.
They turned around.
I think we'll let the police handle this.
Man, this car's a real dud.
I don't often use it to escape from the police.
Police are gaining on us... but they're not gonna get us, man.
I'm gonna lose 'em.
They're shooting at us!
Stop this car, you black bastard!
Stop it!
Whatever you say, baby.
Ha! No way they gonna get me, man.
This is 22 charlie to headquarters. Over.
Roger, 22. This is headquarters.
We are inoperative.
Lost suspects vicinity ridge route 4 and compton place.
Request assistance.
What kind of assistance do you require, 22?
Well, a tow truck would be nice.
Well, are you gonna help me or not?
I told you, I haven't decided yet.
Listen man I know the jury the d.a. and the papers all say I'm guilty, but big Jack knows the truth.
Well, big Jack better stop this insanity and give himself up before we're all killed.
What's this "we" stuff?
They're not after you. They're after me.
So I'll do the thinking.
You said back there that you were innocent.
I am.
They all say that.
Sure they do, but, in my case it happens to be true.
Heck, I didn't know you guys were gonna do this to me.
I figured I was gonna die anyway, so what the hell.
They transplant something from my body makes a kid live, that's good.
But I had no idea you was gonna do this.
Anyway, I'm innocent, and I'm gonna prove it.
So, how about it?
I told you, I haven't decided yet.
You mean you're actually considering helping this escaped murderer?
Murderer?
You're the murderer, trying to cut off my head.
That's different.
Funny how it becomes different when you're talking about your own head.
What is it?
We obviously have a flat.
You gonna stay with me, doc?
Do I have a choice?
Nope.
At least not right now.
Let's go.
This is 2-19 to headquarters.
We'll rest here till dark.
Then we'll make it over to my girl's house.
The police may be looking for you there.
It's cool,
'cause they don't know where she live.
May I have your attention, please, ground control.
We're going to move out across ridge 4.
Please spread out.
Follow us in a line, and we'll see if we can help you spot him.
Let's go.
So how did it happened.
What?
How'd you wind up on death row?
Oh, a cop got killed with a gun
I used to own a few years back.
If you didn't do it, didn't you have an alibi?
Willie thompson.
Well, who's that?
Crazy guy I used to know.
Came knocking on my door a few days before I got picked up.
He'd pulled a job and the police had gotten a make on him.
So... he needed a place to hide out.
It's interesting, how criminals always seek out other criminals.
Man, I ain't no criminal.
Of course you're not.
Wait, hold on, doctor.
Go ahead. Now, what happened then?
Well, the night the cop got killed, willie and I stayed at my place.
The next morning I went to the store to get some food, they arrested me.
When willie heard I'd been picked up, he disappeared like a ghost, man.
And neither you nor the police have been able to find him since, have you?
Nope.
But we will.
It's just a matter of time.
Psst!
Williams,
I got a proposition for you.
This transplant has made medical history.
Now, we should work together.
Just you and me.
You and me?
Look, you work with me on this, and I'll make it up to you.
Just you and me.
We'll take all the credit for what we've done here.
What about Dr. Desmond?
Philip?
Oh, he's an excellent surgeon, but I see a more promising future with you.
You actually feel that I could take credit for something with which
I had very little to do?
I don't understand you.
The reason you don't understand, doctor, is because you're a bigot.
A bigot of the highest caliber.
And because of that, you have underestimated me and my intelligence.
Maybe I said it badly.
I appreciate your intelligence.
But we're expanding the operational facilities, with a much larger lab contingency, and I need a man like you to head that department.
And in order to win all that great acclaim and prestige, all I have to do is help you cut off his head.
This is chopper 2-9er-2 to ground control.
Have lost suspect in the vicinity of hill 14.
Recommend you proceed immediately to this area.
We got to get out of here fast!
Let's go.
Hey, w-w-wait a minute, man uh... look, before I get killed,
I'll make a deal with you.
You put that thing away, and I'll stick with you, OK?
Deal. Let's go.
Ready?
You're gonna get us all killed!
All right, let's go!
Are you out of your mind?
I'm the one that'll get us out of here.
Not this way you won't!
You idiot!
I hope you know what you're doing!
Hold on! We're gonna get fancy!
Yahoo!
This is chopper 2-9er-2 to car 7-4.
Suspect Jack moss, is now on the saddleback race course approximately 1 1/2 miles due south of your present roadblock position.
We are returning to base and will advise unit control to surround the area.
Will you please stop this infernal machine!
Oh, just shut up!
Harry, Sam, check the back of the house.
Come on, will.
I know, I know, Mitch.
But it's not as bad as it sounds.
Look, Mitch, the police are here.
Can I call you back when I find out some more information?
Yeah, my god, Phil.
Do you have any conception of what this means?
We talked about secrecy and... and public opinion.
This is incredible!
Mitch, I understand, but we're doing everything possible.
It's not as bad as it sounds.
Phil, a murderer is on the loose because of my decision.
The press is saying that you've turned him into a two-headed monster.
I've committed political suicide!
And you say it's not as bad as it sounds.
Mitch, I'll... I'll have to get back to you.
It's not as bad as it sounds.
I'll get you.
We'll never get through this alive!
This is Baker 22.
Head him off at the south end of the field.
You black bastard.
Oh, my god!
You OK, Harry?
I think I broke my arm.
I told you to keep that seat belt fastened.
Harry... stick your head out the window and see if any more is coming.
Car 88 car 88.
I got him coming around circle pass.
You come in from the other direction.
10-4. we've got him now.
Aah!
Aah!
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's me, baby, big Jack.
It's all right, honey.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You get into more shit.
They were talking about this on the television, but I had no idea...
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
How about a kiss?
Honey... um...
I... I know you don't like to answer a lot of questions, but... but how did that happen?
Oh, I'll tell you about that later.
This is Max, he's a doctor.
Nice to meet you.
Well, does he talk?
Sure he does.
Don't touch me!
See? Works every time.
This is fred.
He's a doctor, too.
Hello.
Honey, I was wondering, um... do you have two of anything else?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Dick Whittington.
At the top of the news tonight is certainly one of the most bizarre stories this reporter has ever heard.
But it has been reported by several confirmed eyewitnesses that a two-headed monster has been seen.
Police have issued an all-points bulletin.
Police and state officials are also investigating the mysterious disappearance of condemned murderer Jack moss, who last month donated his body to medical science.
How this situation came about is still not known.
Earlier at his home this morning, we interviewed, or should I say, we attempted to interview.
Dr. philip Desmond, the acting chief of the
Kirshner transplant foundation.
And here is that interview.
Dr. Desmond, what kind of an experiment was performed on Jack moss?
It was not an experiment, it was an operation.
What can you tell us about the two-headed man?
No further comments.
It was a transplant operation, wasn't it, doctor?
Look, gentlemen, the foundation in a few days will issue a formal statement.
Now, excuse me.
Level with us, doctor.
Have you created a monster?
Aw, come on, doc, give us a break.
What are you trying to hide, anyway?
And as you can see, still no answers.
But, this is known... a two-headed man has been seen, and it is suspected that condemned murderer Jack moss is one of those two heads.
Police have reported that their switchboards are jammed with calls from an alarmed and panicked public.
And we'll be right back after this important commercial message.
You get some sleep, baby.
I'll wake you when dinner's ready.
Why don't you stay here for a little while?
Oh, come on, honey,
I got to start dinner.
You don't have to start now.
Why don't you do it later?
Come on, Jack, uh... is he bothering you?
I'll cover his head with a pillow case.
You must be joking.
Is that all you people ever think about?
It's no use, honey.
Maybe when I get used to it.
Now you know, you got to go.
So what's gonna happen to Jack?
What about that other head?
I don't know yet.
Um...
Jack tells me that you're trying to help him locate his witness.
That's right.
His name is willie thompson.
We tracked him down once in Nashville, but... he took off before we could talk to him.
You say "we." does that mean you have a detective agency on it?
Mm-hmm.
Then you really believe that he's innocent.
Well, if I didn't, would I spend all this time and money?
I don't know.
Look,
Jack was railroaded because the cops didn't have any other leads.
The only crime Jack ever committed was letting willie hide out at his place.
The only problem is, that's Jack's story, too.
Listen, it's also willie thompson's story.
I talked to willie before he took off, once he heard the cops had picked up Jack.
He thought the cops were getting too close, so he said he was sorry he got Jack into trouble and took off.
And when I told them that in court, they said it was hearsay.
So what about you?
Why are you here?
Jack wants me to help him.
Well, are you?
Well... the more I hear, the more I think I will.
That's good.
Because he certainly doesn't deserve what he's getting.
Come on. You can help me clean these greens.
Anyway...
I didn't uh, I didn't kill nobody, and now I got a second chance to prove it.
And you're gonna get us both killed trying it.
That's great logic.
Here, man, have some pork chop... oh, take it away.
I can't stand that garbage.
What's the matter, baby, don't you dig soul food?
What have you got for dessert, watermelon?
What do y'all think about having fried possum and chitterlings for supper, tonight?
Yes, sir. ha!
Anyway doctor, you don't have to worry about eatin',
'cause I'm gonna take care of that.
After all, it's my stomach.
And after supper, we can all sit around and sing spirituals.
Could I have a cigarette?
Oh, sure, honey.
Jack.
Lila was telling me about willie thompson.
Same think I told you, right?
Right. Seems like the court did give you a raw deal.
Hey man, don't be smokin' while I'm eatin'.
Doc.
How difficult would it be to remove mr. Personality from of Jack's back?
Without the team of surgeons and the proper facilities, absolutely impossible.
Oh, come on now, doctor.
We both know better than that.
What do you mean?
I mean that placing your head on Jack's body must have been quite a task, but the removal process is quite different, isn't it, doc?
In fact, one might consider it merely a basic amputation.
You mean... you mean you could cut him off of Jack's back by yourself?
Yes, that's right.
If there's someplace where we can find the right drugs and... surgical equipment... we could do it right here.
And you're gonna help me?
Yes.
I think I will.
Williams, if you cut off my head, that will be murder.
But it's OK for you to cut off my head, is that right?
Williams, I'm warning you...
Listen Kirshner,
I've heard enough to convince me that this man is innocent... and that you have no right to his body.
Then you're gonna help me?
Yes.
Honey, can we borrow your car?
Why, you idiot, you do this, you'll be the same as he is, a murderer.
Boys, boys, boys, don't argue.
It's all settled.
Dr. Max has got to go.
Hold it. Hold it.
Do you think there are any guards in here?
How am I supposed to know?
Did you bring your gun with you?
Tsk. I left it at lila's.
Are you sure you've ever done anything like this before?
Not even in your apprenticeship?
Let's go.
This is it.
Hey!
What's goin' on here?
Hey, what's happenin'?
Jack.
He's taking control of your body.
Cut it out, man!
Doctor help me, doctor! Help me!
Uhh!
Now... now it's your turn.
Oh, this is Dr. Kirshner.
May I speak to Dr. Desmond, please?
Max, where are you?
Philip, can you talk?
Yes, Max, I can talk.
Well, listen carefully.
I haven't got much time.
I want you, Smith, and Patricia.
To prepare for the removal of the other head.
Max, no, no, no.
The place is crawling with police.
They want moss dead.
Now, you don't stand a chance of getting in here.
I see.
All right.
I'll have to handle it myself.
Max, listen to me!
All I've done is listen.
Now, this is basically a very simple operation.
And I think I can do it myself.
I'll contact you when I'm able.
...abrasions, several broken arms, one broken leg, and numerous bruises and broken ribs.
All of the officers involved appear to be in good health.
The chase, which took place in a deserted field near the city of ackersfield, resulted in the total demolition of 14 police vehicles.
We were able to interview lieutenant J.J. Hinesacker who led the chase.
- I'll get him!
- I'll get the...
Thank you for those words of encouragement, lieutenant Hinesacker.
And now to our sports desk.
Lila?
This is Dr. Williams.
Kirshner has taken control of the body and has gotten away.
There are only 2 places he could have gone and I don't think he'll try the hospital.
Can you borrow a car?
Ok, pick me up on the corner of Washington and J as soon as possible.
Ok?
All right.
Philip, what is it?
I just talked to Max.
I don't know what's going on but,
I want to be able to operate within a moment's notice.
But we can't work here.
The police.
I know. I know.
Maybe they'll catch him alive.
In that case, we'll be ready.
Tell Dr. Smith to uh, stand by.
Now, you don't want to do that, doctor.
You'd be killing an innocent man.
Hello.
Doctor?
You had better get over to Dr.
Kirshner's house as soon as possible.
He needs your help.
Who is this?
Hello?
Philip...
Philip... get me another body.
Please.
Oh, happy day when Jesus whore my sense away oh, happy day he taught me how to walk and prai he taught me how to pray oh, happy day it was every day oh, happy day this god of mine he taught me how to prai oh.
Oh, every day oh, happy day my god showed me the way oh, happy day...
There was me.
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...
... what to do with the evening.
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...
... which is what we were drinking.
This would sharpen you up...
... and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.
In Dublin 's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes
On sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels..."
One thing I could never stand...
... was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie...
... howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers...
... and going "blerp blerp"
in between...
... as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers?
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.
Not in a stinking world like this.
And what's so stinking about it?
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order anymore!
It stinks because it lets the young get onto the old...
...like you done!
It's no world for an old man any longer.
What kind of a world is it at all?
Men on the moon.
Men spinning around the earth.
And there's not no attention paid...
...to earthly law and order no more.
Oh, dear land
I fought for thee
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...
... and his four droogs.
They were about to perform
a little of the old...
... in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...
...billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.
How are thou...
...thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil?
Come and get one in the yarbles...
...if you have any yarbles...
...you eunuch jelly, thou.
Let's get them, boys!
The police!
Come on. Let's go!
The Durango 95 purred away
real horrorshow.
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers...
... with real country dark.
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night...
... playing Hogs of the Road.
Then we headed west.
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.
That was a real kick...
... and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.
Who on earth could that be?
I'll go and see.
Yes, who is it?
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.
But, missus, it's a matter of life and death!
Who is it, dear?
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.
He wants to use the telephone.
I suppose you better let him in.
Wait a minute, will you?
I'm sorry, but we don't usually let strangers in...
What do you want from me?
Pete, check the rest of the house. Dim...
I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun 's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And I'm singing
Just singing...
... in the rain
Viddy well, little brother.
Viddy well.
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...
... it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.
Hello, Lucy.
Had a busy night?
We've been working hard too.
Pardon me, Luce.
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...
... laughing and govoreeting.
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...
... she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers...
... some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...
... standing endwise.
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...
... and then down again.
Because I knew what she sang.
It was a bit from
the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners.
Without a dook of an idea about how to comport yourself public-wise.
I don't like you should do what you done.
And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that.
Do watch that, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles!
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!
I'll meet you with chain or nozh or britva anytime.
I'm not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless.
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.
A nozh scrap anytime you say.
Doobidoob.
A bit tired maybe.
Best not to say more.
Bedways is rightways now.
So best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka.
Right, right?
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...
... in municipal flat block
1 8- A, Linear North.
It had been a wonderful evening.
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.
Oh, bliss!
Bliss and heaven!
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...
... gravity all nonsense now.
As I slooshied...
... I knew such lovely pictures.
Alex. Alex!
What do you want?
It's past eight, Alex.
You don't want to be late for school, son.
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.
Leave us be, and I'll try and sleep it off.
And then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
But you've not been to school all week, son.
Got to rest, Mum.
Got to get fit.
Otherwise, I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.
He's not feeling too good again this morning, Dad.
Yes. Yes, I heard.
You know what time he got in?
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.
I wonder...
...where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Like he says...
...it's mostly odd things he does.
Helping-like...
...here and there, as it might be.
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.
Funny surprise, seeing you here.
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?
I met your mother on the way to work, yes?
She gave me the key.
She said something about a pain somewhere.
Hence, not at school, yes?
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother sir.
It should be clear by this afterlunch.
Or certainly by this evening, yes.
The evening's the great time, isn't it, Alex-boy?
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time.
Sit, sit, sit!
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir?
Anything wrong, sir?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong?
Have you been doing something you shouldn't?
Just a manner of speech.
Yes, well, it's just a manner of speech from your...
...post-corrective advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex.
Because next time it's not going to be the corrective school.
Next time it'll be the Barley place, and all my work ruined.
If you've no respect for yourself...
...you at least might have some for me, who sweated over you.
A big, black mark, I tell you, for every one we don't reclaim.
A confession of failure for every one of you...
...who ends up in the stripy hole.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.
The millicents have nothing on me, brother.
Sir, I mean.
Cut out this clever talk about millicents.
Just because the police haven't picked you up...
...doesn't mean that you've not been up to some nastiness.
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?
A few of a certain Billy-boy's friends were ambulanced off late.
Your name was mentioned.
The words got to me by the usual channels.
Certain friends of yours were named also.
Nobody can prove anything about anybody, as usual.
I'm warning you, little Alex...
...being a good friend to you as always...
...the one man in this sore and sick community...
...who wants to save you from yourself!
What gets into you all?
We've been studying the problem for damn well near a century.
But we get no farther with our studies.
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.
You've got not too bad of a brain.
Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Nobody's got anything on me.
I been out of the millicents' rookers for a long time.
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.
You're about due, by my reckoning.
That's why I'm warning you...
...to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt.
Do I make myself clear?
As an unmuddied lake, sir.
As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer.
You can rely on me, sir.
Excuse me, brother.
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?
Just a minute.
Pardon me, ladies.
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?
A bit cold and pointless, isn't it, my lovely?
What's happened to yours, my little sister?
Who you getting, bratty?
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?
The Heaven 17?
What you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on?
I bet you've got little pitiful, portable picnic players.
Come with Uncle and hear all proper.
Hear angel trumpets and devil trombones.
You are invited.
Hi, hi, hi, there.
Well, hello.
He are here!
He have arrived!
Hooray!
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well!
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?
We got worried.
There we were, waiting and drinking away at the old knifey moloko...
...and you had not turned up.
And we thought you might have been, like...
...offended by something or other.
So around we come to your abode.
Appy polly loggies.
I had something of a pain in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.
I was not awakened when I gave orders for wakening.
Sorry about the pain.
Using the gulliver too much-like, maybe.
Giving orders and discipline and such, perhaps.
You sure the pain is gone?
You sure you'd not be happier back in bed?
Let's get things nice and sparkling clear.
This sarcasm, if I may call it such...
...does not become you, my little brothers.
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.
Now then, Dim.
What does that great big horsey gape of a grin portend?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother.
That's part of the new way.
New way?
What's this about a new way?
There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, I know it.
If you must have it, have it, then.
We go around shop crasting and the like...
...coming out with a pitiful rookerfull of money each.
And Will the English in the coffee mesto...
...saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast.
The shiny stuff. The ice!
The big, big money's available, is what Will the English says.
And what will you do with the big, big, big money?
Have you not everything you need?
If you need a motorcar, you pluck it from the trees.
If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child.
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.
Good! Real horrorshow!
Initiative comes to thems that wait.
I've taught you much, my little droogies.
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some moloko plus.
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...
... I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...
... saying what we should do
and what not to do.
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...
... and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.
There was a window open
with a stereo on...
... and I viddied right at once
what to do.
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...
... the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...
... down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.
Now they knew who was
master and leader.
Sheep, thought I.
But a real leader knows
always when, like...
... to give and show generous
to his unders.
Now we're back to where we were.
Yes?
Just like before, and all forgotten?
Right, right, right?
Right.
Right.
Right.
Well, Georgie-boy...
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.
Not tonight.
Not this nochy.
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.
You're a big, strong chelloveck, like us all.
We're not little children, are we, Georgie-boy?
What, then, didst thou in thy mind have?
It's this health farm.
A bit out of the town.
Isolated.
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver...
... and, like, jewels.
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.
Oh, shit!
Who's there?
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!
Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I'm frightfully sorry.
There's a telephone in the public house a mile down the road.
I suggest you use that.
But missus, this is an emergency!
It's a matter of life and death!
Me friend's lying in the middle of the road, bleeding to death!
I'm very sorry, but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Very well, madam.
You can't be blamed for being suspicious...
...with so many scoundrels and rogues of the night about.
I'll try and get help at the pub, then.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Dim, bend down.
I'll get in that window and open the front door.
Radlett Police Station?
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers at Woodmere Health Farm.
I'm sorry to bother you, but something rather odd just happened.
It's probably nothing at all, but you never know.
A young man rang the bell, asking to use the telephone.
He said there's been some kind of accident.
The thing that caught my attention was what he said.
His words sounded like those quoted in the papers this morning...
...in connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted.
Just a few minutes ago.
If you think that's necessary.
But I'm quite sure he's gone away now.
All right, fine.
Thank you very much.
Hi, hi, hi, there.
At last we meet.
Our brief govorett through the letter-hole was not satisfactory.
Who are you?
How the hell did you get in here?
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
Naughty, naughty, naughty!
You filthy old soomaka.
Now listen here, you little bastard!
Just turn round and walk out of here the same way you came in.
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!
It's a very important work of art.
What the bloody hell do you want?
To be perfectly honest, madam...
...I'm taking part in an international students' contest...
...to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Cut the shit, sonny...
...and get out of here before you get yourself into serious trouble.
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...
...before I throw you out!
Wretched, slummy bedbug!
I'll teach you to break into real people's houses.
Fucking...
...little...
...bastard!
- Let's go. The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.
You bastards! I'm blind!
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!
It's no good sitting there in hope, my little brothers.
I won't say a single solitary slovo unless I have my lawyer here.
I know the law, you bastards.
Righty-right, Tom.
We'll have to show our friend Alex here that we know the law too.
But that knowing the law isn't everything.
Nasty cut you've got there, little Alex.
Shame, isn't it?
Spoils all your beauty.
Who gave you that, then?
How'd you do that, then?
What's your point, you bastard?
That is for your lady victim.
You ghastly...
...wretched scoundrel.
Get him off me!
You rotten little bastard!
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.
Good evening, Sergeant.
They're in room B, sir.
Thank you very much.
Sergeant...
Good evening.
Good evening, Inspector.
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, Sergeant.
May I have some paper towels, please?
We're interrogating the prisoner now.
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.
Oh, dear! This boy does look a mess, doesn't he?
Just look at the state of him.
Love's young nightmare-like.
Violence makes violence.
He resisted his lawful arrestors.
This is the end of the line for me.
The end of the line, yes.
And what of me, brother sir?
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.
I was led on by the treachery of others.
Sings the roof off lovely, he does, sir.
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!
It was all their idea, brothers.
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!
You are now a murderer, little Alex.
A murderer.
Not true, sir.
It was only a slight tolchok.
She were breathing, I swear it.
I've just come from the hospital.
Your victim has died.
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.
This is some new form of torture.
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.
I hope to God it'll torture you to madness.
If you'd care to give him a bash in the chops, don't mind us.
We'll hold him down.
He must be a great disappointment to you, sir.
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...
... O my brothers and only friends.
After a trial,
with judges and a jury...
... and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...
... he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84- F...
... among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...
... against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...
... at her only child
and son of her bosom...
... like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.
Right! Open up the cell!
Yes, sir.
Here are the prisoner's committal forms.
Thank you, mister.
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.
From this moment, you will address all prison officers as "sir."
Name?
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
Sentence?
14 years, sir.
Crime?
Murder, sir.
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.
You are now 655321.
It is your duty to memorize that number.
Thank you, mister. Well done.
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.
All right, empty your pockets.
Are you able to see the white line painted on the floor...
...directly behind you...
Then your toes belong...
...on the other side of it!
- Yes, sir.
- Right.
Carry on.
Pick that up...
...and put it down properly.
One half-bar of chocolate.
One bunch of keys on white metal ring.
One packet of cigarettes.
Two plastic ball pens.
One black, one red.
One pocket comb, black plastic.
One address book, imitation red leather.
One ten-penny piece.
One white metal wristlet watch...
...Timawrist, on a white metal expanding bracelet.
Anything else in your pockets?
- No, sir.
- Right.
Sign here for your valuable property.
The tobacco and chocolate you brought in...
...you lose that...
...as you are now convicted.
Now over to the table and get undressed.
Were you in police custody this morning?
One jacket, blue pinstriped.
Prison custody?
Yes, sir, on remand.
- One necktie, blue.
- Religion?
C. Of E., sir.
Do you mean the Church of England?
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.
Brown hair, isn't it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue, sir.
Do you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or any false limbs?
One pair of trousers, blue pinstriped.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
One pair of socks, black.
Are you an epileptic?
One pair of underpants, white with blue waistband.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a homosexual?
Right.
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.
Now then, face the wall...
...bend over and touch your toes.
Any venereal disease?
Crabs? Lice?
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.
What's it going to be, eh?
Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this...
...though more in than out for most of you?
Or are you going to attend to the divine word...
...and realize the punishments that await unrepentant sinners...
...in the next world as well as this?
A lot of idiots you are...
...selling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge.
The thrill of theft.
Of violence.
The urge to live easy.
Well, I ask you what is it worth...
...when we have undeniable proof...
...yes, incontrovertible evidence...
...that hell exists?
I know!
I know, my friends.
I have been informed...
...in visions...
...that there is a place...
...darker than any prison...
...hotter than any flame of human fire...
...where souls...
...of unrepentant criminal sinners like yourselves...
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.
I say, like yourselves...
...scream...
...in endless and unendurable agony.
Their skin...
...rotting and peeling.
A fireball...
...spinning in their screaming guts!
I know. Yes, I know!
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...
...in the prisoner's hymnal.
And let's have a little reverence, you bastards!
I was a wandering sheep
- Sing up, damn you!
- I did not love the fold
Louder!
I did not love my shepherd's voice
I would not be controlled
Louder!
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...
... and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...
... ready to dribble all over...
... a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.
It was my rabbit...
... to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...
... and also now very interested
in the Big Book.
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.
And I could viddy myself
helping in...
... and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.
I didn 't so much like
the latter part of the Book...
... which is more like
all preachy talking...
... than fighting
and the old in-out.
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...
... and then drink
their Hebrew vino...
... and getting onto the bed
with their wives ' handmaidens.
That kept me going.
"Seek not to be like evil men.
Neither desire to be with them...
...because their minds studieth robberies...
...and their lips speak deceits."
If thou lose hope, being weary in the days of distress...
...thy strength shall be diminished.
Fine, my son. Fine.
Father?
I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.
I've never been guilty of any institutional infraction, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.
And you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father...
...can I ask you a question in private?
Certainly, my son. Certainly.
Is there something troubling you, my son?
Don't be shy to speak up.
Remember...
...I know of the...
...urges that can trouble young men...
...deprived...
...of the society of women.
It's nothing like that, Father.
It's about this new thing they're all talking about.
About this new treatment.
It gets you out of prison in no time.
And makes sure you never get back in again.
Where did you hear about this?
Who's been talking about these things?
These things get around.
Two warders talk, as it might be.
And somebody can't help overhearing what they say.
Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops...
...and the newspaper tells all about it.
How about putting me in for this new treatment?
I take it you are referring...
...to the Ludovico technique.
I don't know what it's called.
I just know it gets you out quickly...
...and makes sure you never get back in again.
That is not proven, 655321.
In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
It has been used, hasn't it?
It has not been used in this prison yet.
The governor has grave doubts about it.
And I've heard there are very serious dangers involved.
I don't care about the dangers.
I just want to be good.
I want for the rest of my life to be...
...one act of goodness.
The question is...
...whether or not this technique really makes a man good.
Goodness comes from within.
Goodness...
...is chosen.
When a man cannot choose...
...he ceases to be a man.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father.
I only know I want to be good.
Be patient, my son.
Put your trust in the Lord.
Instruct Thy Son and He shall refresh thee...
...and shall give delight to thy soul.
Amen.
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!
Right!
All present and correct, sir!
Prisoners, halt!
Now pay attention!
I want you in two lines...
...up against that wall, facing this way.
Go on, move!
Hurry up!
Stop talking!
Prisoners ready for inspection, sir!
How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get?
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.
I agree, sir. We need larger prisons, more money.
Not a chance, my dear fellow.
The government can't be concerned any longer...
...with outmoded penalogical theories.
Soon we may need all prison space for political offenders.
Common criminals are best dealt with on a purely curative basis.
Kill the criminal reflex, that's all.
Full implementation in a year's time.
Punishment means nothing to them.
They enjoy their so-called punishment.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Shut your bleeding hole!
Who said that?
I did, sir.
O great American multitude, and sports fans everywhere.
Today we inaugurate the 20th annual
Transcontinental Road Race.
Today the five bravest young men and women in this bravest of nations will risk their lives in the greatest sporting event since the days of Spartacus.
Three days hence, a new American champion will be crowned, for all the world to behold in awe, in respect, in fear.
All right, all right. This is Junior Bruce, your buddy-buddy and mine.
And I'll be giving you the blow-by-blow play-by-play when the kings and queens of the open road roar onto the track.
Do I hear the sound of engines?
It's "Calamity" Jane Kelly, queen of the road, at the wheel of that mean old ornery stud Bull.
Zany Janie, winner of this year's trials at Watkins Glen, placed second in 1998 and led at last year's second lap until she went out with gear trouble.
Her fans and lovers everywhere wish Janie better luck this year.
My fans can wish me all the luck they want.
If my luck with my lovers gets any better,
I'll miss the race completely.
Isn't that right, Pete?
With the start of the race only a heartthrob away, this is Grace Pander on the spot - as usual - to welcome the greatest racer of all time, and a very dear friend of mine.
Yes, in just a moment he will be coming through the doors!
There is no cause for alarm.
The patient has been flown in from abroad in a state of suspended animation in order to facilitate the healing of his recent limb transplants.
He should be coming around any moment now.
Oh, my...
I don't believe it!
Frankenstein, can you give me an exclusive? How are things abroad?
How is Mr. President?
Is he still in Moscow?
Mr. President is in his summer palace in Peking.
He loves everybody.
And everybody loves him.
- Sieg!
- Heil!
Here she is, that adorable swastika sweetheart,
Matilda the Hun from Milwaukee!
And her lovable Nazi navigator,
Herman "the German" Bock!
Matilda, Herman, do you think this is your turn to be first and foremost in sunny California?
- Today, California.
- Tomorrow, the world.
Hiya, Herman.
I hope your Buzz Bomb has a little more juice in its warhead this year.
Whoever named your car the Bull, was only half right!
Frankenstein, will Mr. President fly in to crown the winner of the race?
Yes.
Is it true that with your new mechanical arm you can shift gears in less than a twentieth of a second?
- Would you care to comment on that?
- No.
How do you feel about going into the race with a navigator you've never met?
You'll love Annie.
She's a red-hot sexpot.
She better be a red-hot navigator.
No more questions.
It's the Lion! And at the wheel,
Ray "Nero the Hero" Lonnegan.
Never has finished the Transcontinental, but three big wins in the provinces this season plus a brand-new beast means Nero's not fiddling around.
Sit still, Cleopatra, and stop blocking me.
My fans wanna see me.
They've never seen a has-been before?
- Annie Smith?
- Mr. Frankenstein.
I've checked out the car, and everything seems perfect.
- I have the route maps right here.
- I will check them in a minute.
We will roll... when everything seems perfect... to me.
I've packed some high-protein capsules and as many adrenaline tablets as I could find.
And I've also assembled a medical kit, just in case. I'm trained as a nurse.
I don't need a nurse.
I need a navigator.
Mr. Frankenstein, you're very good at what you do, and I'm very good at what I do.
We'll see.
And you know there's only one person who guns an engine like that.
It's gotta be the roughest tough guy of 'em all,
"Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo!
Here he comes - Machine Gun Joe.
Loved by thousands, hated by millions.
Only living previous winner except for Frankenstein.
Highest lifetime score after Frankenstein.
And he's certainly getting the welcome he deserves.
Joe doesn't look too happy, but you can't keep those Frankenstein fans down.
Lousy sons of bitches.
- Frankenstein?
- Give it to them, Joe.
You want Frankenstein?
I'll give you Frankenstein.
Yeah!
Here he comes!
Here he comes!
Frankenstein!
Frankenstein the legend!
Frankenstein the indestructible!
Sole survivor of the titanic pileup of '95.
Only two-time winner of the Transcontinental Road Race.
Frankenstein - ripped up, wiped out, battered, shattered, creamed and reamed!
A dancer on the brink of death.
Frankenstein, who lost a leg in '98, an arm in '99.
With half a face and half a chest and all the guts in the world, he's back!
God only knows what he looks like under that mask, but he is back.
In the name of Mr. President,
America loves you, Frankenstein.
You will regret that, Joe.
Stay tuned, racing fans.
T- video satellite will bring every mile of thrills and spills into your living room.
All five cars are in starting position here at New York Memorial Raceway, ready to roll.
Now we take you to the Summer Palace.
And Mr. President.
My children, whom I love so dearly, it has been my duty in the long and difficult years since the world crash of '79 to serve you as best I could.
Never before in history have the masses forgone all comfort so that the spirit of genius might thrive and seek the golden key to a new time of plenty in the fertile field of minority privilege.
And now. my children. The drivers are ready. The world is waiting.
Once more,
I give you what you want.
Good morning, Americans.
Once again the race is under way, with 12-hour pit stops scheduled at St Louis and Albuquerque, home of the American Indian Museum.
At this very moment the cars are howling through the streets of Manhattan, but no points have been scored as yet.
Take it away. Junior Bruce.
They're at the Lincoln Tunnel.
With Frankenstein and Joe running neck and neck.
Then it's the Lion. Driven by...
Passed by Calamity Jane in the Bull.
Moving into third place.
All right, and hey, hey, hey!
The cars have split up, the drivers taking off on their favorite routes.
Frankenstein's still out in front.
Headed due west.
With Nero the Hero on his tail hoping to pick up his leftovers.
Calamity Jane's on a northwest tack.
Matilda's Buzz Bomb is trying to catch up with Machine Gun Joe.
Now streaking southwest.
Once again - Mr. President.
I have made the United Provinces of America
the greatest power in the known universe.
I have also given you
the most popular sporting event in the history of mankind -
the Transcontinental Road Race.
Which upholds the American tradition
of no holds barred!
"No holds barred."
That's how he got to be president.
Hypocrite pig!
What about our ultimatum?
He's been laughing us off for 15 years.
Passive resistance means nothing to him.
Pick up that flag, young man.
It's time for action.
It is not a time for violence.
Mrs. Paine, I love Annie as much as you do.
But she's no match for Frankenstein, and we can't risk letting him get away.
Frankenstein is the biggest target in the world and a friend of Mr. President.
That, Lieutenant Fury, is exactly why they'll call off the race. To save his life.
My granddaughter will succeed.
Don't you ever take off that mask?
No.
Don't you know about my face?
I've heard stories.
Nobody's ever seen it, have they?
Except my other navigators.
And they're all dead.
So they are.
They say you lost most of your jaw in the crash of '92.
And my right eye in '95, and my nose and my left eye in '97, and most of my cranium in '98.
I'm held together with patches of plastic and steel plates.
It's not a pretty sight.
You wanna see?
Why not?
I've seen everything else.
Remember, you're doing this on your own.
I take no responsibility.
What'd you expect?
Another pretty face?
- They really love you, Joe.
- Yeah?
Then how come they ain't down here on the road provin' it?
Hey, you better make this left turn.
You'll shave off about 2 miles that way.
Yeah, all right.
All right, all right and yes, siree!
A clean hit! A perfect hit!
And no pain for the target.
Too bad the guy was only 38.
Just two years older, he'd have been worth three times the points.
But, for the second year in a row,
Machine Gun Joe has splattered the scoreboard first.
How'd you like that, huh?
Get off on that one, Myra, baby?
- What's the matter with this engine?
- I don't know. Sounds fine to me.
Amateurs.
Get back there and retard the spark four... uh, three degrees.
I'm glad to see you were able to find your way back.
As the cars roar into Pennsylvania.
The cradle of liberty.
It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets.
Which may make scoring particularly difficult.
Even with this year's rule changes.
To recap those revisions -
women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
But teenagers now rack up 40 points.
And toddlers under 12
now rate a big 70 points.
The big score - anyone.
Any sex. Over 75 years old
has been upped to 100 points.
As always.
How fast you move determines how long you live.
Toro!
A beautiful kill!
A neat kill!
No calamities for Jane today.
No, sir.
And you can bet she'll be getting both ears for that one.
What is that?
Euthanasia day at the geriatrics hospital.
They do it every year.
Here he comes!
He's coming!
Frankenstein scores!
Frankenstein scores at last!
But what kind of a score, boys and girls?
Just 110 points out of a possible big 700.
What do you think about that, Gracie?
Well, those doctors - dear friends of mine - have been pretty smug all these years, setting up the old folks.
Frankenstein must have decided it was their turn.
Which only goes to show that even the fearsome Frankenstein
has a 100% red-blooded American sense of humor.
Annie saved those old people!
And she'll deliver Frankenstein.
Meanwhile, innocent people are being slaughtered on our highways.
They're like Christians being thrown to the gladiators.
But just remember, the Christians won.
Did they, Mrs. Paine?
I take it from your attire that your sabotage operations are being carried out, despite my wishes?
Mrs. Paine, we're set to hit 'em with everything we've got.
Then.
In the name of humanity.
Let Operation Anti-Race begin.
How in hell are we supposed to score in this graveyard?
You're the navigator.
That's your problem.
And think of something soon, or else you're gonna be out on your ass.
It isn't my fault everyone scored before us.
You should have hit that boy scout camp like I told you.
I tried the god dammed boy scout camp.
You know how fast those boy scouts move?
Now, here's something more your speed.
Gotta be at least 200 points.
If they scatter, go for the baby and the mother.
Come on!
Quick! Quick!
Go for the baby!
The baby!
That's it.
Come get baby.
Bye-bye, baby.
Hello, 70 points.
Hey! I'm off the air!
Would you please take your places?
Put Grace on with an interview, right now.
Hello, ladies. Isn't this just the most exciting race in years?
I certainly think so.
And guess what -
I have a surprise for you.
Mrs. Rhonda Bainbridge, in person, on my show.
The widow of Edward Bainbridge, whom, as we all know, was "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo's first score.
Welcome to my home.
And may I call you Rhonda?
Please do, Mrs. Pander.
- Are we about ready here?
- Yeah, just about.
Listen, we have to go right away.
As the widow of the race's first score.
You have won a high-style two-room apartment in Acapulco!
Start the jam!
And next year you will be watching the race
on a 50-inch three-dimensional octaphonic T-video set...
Fellow oppressed Americans.
The execution of the barbarian killer
Nero the Hero
is the people's first stroke
against the evil and corrupt regime of Mr. President.
I am Thomasina Paine, founder and commander of the army of the resistance.
For 20 years. Americans have been told when to eat and when to sleep.
When to love and when to hate.
The age of obedience is over.
In the names of George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln, and Harry Truman,
I call upon you to stand up for your inalienable rights.
We declare war upon the Bipartisan Party, on Mr. President, and on that most inhuman desecration of life and liberty, the Transcontinental Road Rape.
I thank you.
- What the hell was that?
- I have no information.
- Is this race still on?
- I have no information.
- What do you think?
- About what?
About that speech.
Adds spice to the race.
"Spice"? They've killed Nero.
That would have got more points for me.
Don't you understand?
They've declared war on the race and on you. Aren't you worried?
The only thing that worries me is "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo.
Is winning all you care about?
Yes. It's the only standard of excellence left.
- Come on. Here they come.
- It's not finished.
Come on!
Look at that stupid hole right in the middle.
They won't get through there.
Blitzkrieg!
As the drivers converge from their routes and head for the first pit stop in St. Louis.
Machine Gun Joe is still leading the field.
With Frankenstein second.
Calamity Jane third.
Leaving Matilda the Hun in fourth position
and Calamity Jane facing another calamity!
Right now. Frankenstein's score points put him just ahead of Joe...
Hey! Get off the rope.
Jesus Chrysler, get off the rope!
Hey, dummy, come on over and hold the ladder.
This aggravates me.
Where's the one that says
"Welcome Joe Viterbo"?
Score the son of a bitch, Joe.
You need every point you can get.
I only mashed him slightly.
- Put him out of his misery, Joe.
- Is that fair?
- Yeah!
- Hey. Should I let him go?
Fair's always right.
One thing before we begin.
The government would like it if nobody said anything about Nero. Understand?
He hit a tree, and that's it.
Got it?
- We don't wanna depress anybody by...
- Hey, hey.
Everybody knows he was blown up by the resistance, you schmuck.
It was on television.
If you wanna drive again next year, Mr.
Viterbo, keep those opinions to yourself.
OK. Go ahead.
This is Grace Pander from St Louis, where Matilda - a dear friend of mine - is receiving a well-deserved rub down.
Tell me, Tilly, darling, what can we expect from you when the cars go back on the road?
You can expect a victory... by a member of the master race.
A woman.
Tilly, darling, that certainly is showing a lot of confidence for someone who's lying fourth out of four.
She doesn't mind, as long as she's lying somewhere.
When I'm through with you, you're gonna be lying in state.
If anybody is going to boot hill, it's you and your Bizz Bang.
- Buzz Bomb.
- Shut up.
You just leave my navigator alone.
Girls, girls, girls.
Remember you're on TV-land.
Pete, how do you like being a navigator?
Well, Junior, I'd like it more if I was in the driver's seat.
You'll get what's coming to you on the road.
Oh, yeah?
What's coming to me is the final solution to the cowgirl problem.
Frankenstein, when are you gonna make your move?
Are you gonna take off-road chances for scores, or are you driving all-out to be first into New L.A.?
It's not about winning, it's how you play the game.
Frankenstein - a dear friend of mine.
Frankenstein, tell me how it feels when, at that electric instant, at 200 mph, life and death coexist at the moment of scoring.
If you stand in the middle of Route 66 tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, you can answer that question for yourself.
What are you doing?
Get away from me. Joe will go nuts!
Just tell him I was whispering sweet nothings in your ear.
Well, Myra, what did Frankenstein have to say to you?
H- h-h-he didn't say anything. He...
- What'd he say?
- Nothing...
- What'd he say?!
- Nothing!
I'm not playing games, Myra.
I wanna know what he said.
He said there was nothing sweet in my ear.
"In my ear."
What do you want?
My name is Laurie,
Mr. Frankenstein.
I'm head of Chapter Seven,
St Louis Lovers of Frankenstein.
- I was chosen from over 100 girls...
- To offer me your body? Is that it?
You want me because I drive the Monster and wear this costume.
No, Mr. Frankenstein.
That wouldn't be fair to your navigator.
It's taken her years of hard work to earn that privilege.
Besides, we understand your feelings.
What do you know of my feelings?
Everything. Like...
Like why you're afraid of falling in love.
And why winning the race means everything to you.
How do you know these things?
From my dreams, partly.
And from letters I get from other fans.
Plus the club subscribes to an astrology service.
Well, if you're not here to offer me your body, what do you want?
I wanted to meet you, Mr. Frankenstein.
I wanted you to know who I am.
So it would have meaning.
I don't understand.
So what would have meaning?
We love you, Mr. Frankenstein. I know just saying it doesn't mean much.
Why do you love me?
Because I kill people?
Scoring isn't killing, Mr. Frankenstein.
It's part of the race.
You're a national hero, and we want you to know we're with you 100%.
Good night, Mr. Frankenstein.
I didn't hear you come in.
Who were you expecting?
Machine Gun Joe?
I thought I could trust you.
You really just don't wanna give me a chance, do you?
I was trying to help you.
I'm... sorry.
You're what?
Sorry.
He wanted to know our route, so I told him to go down 54 through the Cimarron Valley.
54 is a dead end.
Leads nowhere.
That's right.
And if Joe takes it, he's sunk.
The only way Joe will take that road is if he sees us do it first.
Or if he's ahead of us.
- Is that the arm that came off in '98?
- Mm-hm.
And... which one of those obviously perfect legs was it that came off in '99?
The right.
And the left one was just broken in six places and burned down to the bone.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.
It's a miracle you can still walk.
Do you like to dance?
Those Swiss mechanics sure did a good job on you.
What else did they replace?
Wait a minute... and I'll show you.
O Mr. President, bless thy children and make them strong.
Bless thy daughters Matilda and Jane, and thy son Joe.
And bless thy beloved son, the immortal Frankenstein, who has given so much pleasure to so many.
The hell with Frankenstein.
What about Joe Viterbo?
The flag is down and they're away, with Machine Gun Joe blasting into the lead on this second lap of the great
Transcontinental Road Race.
Frankenstein is making a left turn, splitting early from the pack.
Look out, all you folks just south of here.
Gee, Joe, there's nobody even close behind us.
Shh.
Where's he going?
What's he doing?
- Hey, where are we going?
- I dropped my glove.
Let not the ruin of thy robes destruct the tires...
Jesus Chrysler!
Ladies and gentlemen, by a bizarre accident
Frankenstein has killed our cherished colleague the deacon of the Bipartisan Party.
I think you did that on purpose.
Have to give the fans something to talk about.
It's my obligation as a national hero.
Frankenstein's score is now...
Does that score count, Harold?
An interesting point, Junior, and one that may set a significant precedent.
Can a racer score a race official?
Ooh, and after all those nice things he said about him.
It don't matter. It don't count.
You can't score religious personalities.
The word "deacon" has been handed down to us from the ancient... the, uh...
Frankenstein's score has been approved for 50 points.
The confirmation has just been handed to me. You know what that means, Junior?
That means that the race officials from coast to coast will be falling like flies.
- Frankenstein! Agh! I hate him. I hate him.
- Oh, sh...
You're salivating.
Oh, my...
Why did she do that?
To show me she loves me.
Here they come.
Let's get set.
Chicken game.
- Chicken in a basket.
- Chicken in a casket.
Oh, shit!
Yeah, hey.
Who got the last laugh now, huh?
- The turnoff, it's coming up.
- Should I take it?
- Who gives a goddamn shit?
- Should I?
She says I should, so I should, right?
Or should I? I don't know.
I don't think you should.
I think it's definitely a trick.
I'll do it.
I won't do it. I'd be a schmuck to do it.
I did it and I'm no schmuck!
- That's your story.
- That's right. That's right.
And I see you mess with Frankenstein again, I'm really gonna bust your eye.
What do you mean, "really"?
I have an almost unlimited score possibility, but it's pretty far down the road.
District penitents' compound.
All those old congressmen chained up.
They'd be like sitting ducks.
Yeah, and all I gotta do is drive through a cyclone fence. Uh-uh.
Look, the farther west we go, the fewer targets there'll be.
Hey, come on.
Joe's already on his way to a dead end, and the other two...
OK.
Take the next right.
Now, as soon as the car gets within range,
I shall give the signal.
We'll have just under a minute after they reach the turnoff. Lieutenant Fury...
Lieutenant Fury has nothing whatever to do with this.
I want none of his surprises here.
I could stand for a surprise.
Like if your Frankenstein didn't show up.
Don't worry.
He'll show.
What's our estimated time of arrival in Albuquerque?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, this detour is gonna make a difference.
Haven't you calculated our time of arrival?
I did, but I couldn't take into consideration...
- Take what into consideration?
- Frankenstein! Stop the car!
Hold on.
- What the hell?
- Don't stop now. What are you doing?
What are they doing?
Sorry, brother.
If that's the best the resistance can do, we got nothing to worry about.
I guess not.
One thing I can't figure out is why would they bother to dress that guy up to look like me?
Maybe he was a fan.
Who built this stinkin' road? If I ever get my hands on him, I'll rip his heart out.
I mean it! I'm sick of this race and I'm sick of you!
I guess it must have been Joe that set us up for that ambush, don't you think?
Got in touch with those guys and told them where we were going?
I guess it might have been.
But then how the hell did Joe know we were gonna take a detour?
Maybe it was those guys on the pit crew in St. Louis.
Took your book out of the car while you were getting massaged.
I didn't leave my book in the car.
- You didn't, huh?
- No.
Well, then,
I guess it couldn't have been them.
- Who do you think it was?
- I have no idea.
Why do you care?
They didn't get you.
Us. They didn't get us.
We're a team, remember?
Come on over to my side.
You're gonna drive for a while.
Why? I'm not trained as a driver.
Never mind why.
Just do as I tell you.
I'm counting on you to make a nice big score for us.
Sure.
Anything special in mind?
Something'll turn up.
I'm sure that it will.
Jesus H Christ!
I'll kill that broad!
- What did I do?
- Shut your face.
Cornball, what's the fastest way through here?
Well, um... actually, the only way we do it is we get a bulldozer and we trim this edge down here and we drive through.
No, what's the best way between here and Albuquerque?
- You got to go back to the main highway.
- I'll lose 45 minutes!
I've seen you before. I'm one of your greatest fans, you know that?
I follow all of the races. I got pictures of you all over the outhouse.
I named my favorite dog after you,
Mr. Frankenstein. I did.
Lousy stinkin' dirt ball.
You got two seconds to live.
Come on, Pete, honey.
You gonna take all day with that?
I wanna get on the road, make a few more scores. My blood lust is fading.
Almost finished, Calamity, sweetheart.
We'll be back on the road in no time, then we'll cream that Nazi's ass for her.
What'd you say? I...
Blitzkrieg!
You lousy bitch!
I'll kill you for that!
Nobody scores my navigator and gets away with it.
Uh-oh.
Here she comes.
And boy, is she pissed.
What does she expect?
You leave your navigator lying around, naturally somebody's gonna run over him.
She's gaining on us, momma, and she's got murder on her mind.
Schnell. Meine kleine Buzz Bomb.
- That's good.
- All right, on three. One, two, three.
Support it. Easy.
Steady as she goes.
Here they come!
A detour.
I really needed that right now.
Holy shit.
A special bulletin.
There's been an accident. An explosion.
It looks like Matilda has been blown totally...
Correction. Matilda has made an impressive score. Stand by.
Don't you wanna take over now? I'm afraid
I'm making us lose an awful lot of time.
You're doing just fine.
- Looks like an easy score.
- Yeah. Yeah, it does.
It's always best to start small.
- I missed him.
- It takes some practice.
- Before it comes easy?
- It never comes easy.
Keep your eyes on the road.
How far is it to the penitents' compound?
Oh, maybe 20 miles.
Stop the car.
Get out.
Out.
Come to the other side.
Around the front.
Where is the penitents' compound?
It's in Japan.
Get in.
I could just push you out of this car and pick up a quick 30 points.
Who are you?
Who are you working for?
I'm Thomasina Paine's granddaughter.
I'm honored.
So you were gonna capture me and replace me with that goon back there.
What for?
He was going to deliver our ultimatum to Mr. President.
Your life in exchange for the permanent abolition of the race.
She was a great. Dear friend of mine.
And I shall remember her forever.
Howling down that freeway in the sky.
Knocking over the angels.
The valiant Hun's demise was in fact caused by enemies of the people.
There will be a special broadcast by Mr. President at 1900 hours.
Stay tuned to find out how you can help
Mr. President preserve our way of life...
Calamity, turn off the television.
Hey, you guys wanna stop playing that song, please?
Look, this is a race, a sporting event, not a daredevil stunt. I want some protection.
You should have given us an escort after Nero got it.
Joe would score the escort, wouldn't you, baby?
You wanna zip your lip, Myra? Huh?
Now, are you going to cover me or not?
Look, Mr. Viterbo, if you're afraid to go on with the race, why don't you quit?
You're calling me a turkey?
If you ask me, you're all making excuses for poor driving.
Poor driving?! Listen, honey.
Matilda the Hun was a champion driver.
Nobody could've scored my navigator and gotten away with it.
And he's talking about poor driving!
I'd like to see you do it. I've been driving for ten years. Nobody talks to me like this.
- This stinks.
- It's all on account of the rebels.
Who mentioned anything about rebels?
There are no rebels. Understand?
Then who was that old lady on the television?
Thomasina Paine.
She's a harmless lunatic.
Would you please come outside, sir?
We like to ask you a few questions.
- Come on, Annie.
- Alone, if you don't mind.
Mr. President will explain those accidents during his address to the nation.
- How did she jam the networks?
- And bump off our friends?
She didn't bump off anybody. She walked into a television station waving a gun, forced them to put her on the air. We've taken her back to the asylum. That's it.
- I got just two words to say about that.
- Oh?
Bull shit!
Excuse me.
Hey! I told you to stop playing that song!
You forget, Joe, that I'm a representative of Mr. President's government.
I happen to hold the power of life and death.
Yeah? Well,
I happen to hold the clam sauce.
Look out, Viterbo. You may be the second biggest clown in this circus, but if I want you dead, you're dead.
- Second biggest?
- Sit down and eat!
I told you to stop playing that music!
Were they armed, or did they expect the fire to be enough to stop you?
I don't know what they expected. We just ran through it all and kept going.
One more question,
Mr. Frankenstein.
Did you take that particular road on your own initiative, or on the advice of your navigator?
On my own initiative.
Thank you, Mr. Frankenstein.
That will be all.
There has been a lot of talk about American rebels.
We have positive proof
that it was none other than the treacherous French
who have been sabotaging our great race.
Just as they and their stinking European allies
have undermined and destroyed our great national economy.
It is no coincidence.
My dear children.
That the word "sabotage" was invented by the French.
- Where's Annie?
- I don't know.
Hey, did you hear the news?
Mr. President said it was the French who knocked off Nero and Matilda.
Watch out for the crêpe suzettes.
..."Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo and Frankenstein.
As they begin the last lap of their long and difficult journey
toward New Los Angeles.
Drop your keys?
I was just looking for something I lost.
The race?
Look, Joe...
I threw you off course, OK?
All's fair in love and war.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Annie, because what we got goin' here definitely ain't love.
Well, then, why don't we just forget about it?
You know, Annie, it's too bad things ain't like they were in the old days, when we'd just take somebody in an alley and blow their brains out. You know?
- Joe, please.
- Go ahead and scream, Annie.
- You're hurting me, Joe.
- There's nobody to hear you.
Huh?
How does it feel to know you're gonna spend the rest of your life in pain?
The rest of your life is about a minute and a half.
Frankie. Glad you came. I caught your navigator screwin' around with the car, so I thought I'd come down and have a look at what was going on.
Hey, come on, Frank...
Upstairs.
So much for a fair fight.
Next chance I get, you're dead.
What were you doing? Getting more secret instructions from the lunatic fringe?
Why don't you just turn me in and get it over with?
No need to.
You've blown your cover.
You're no threat to me.
Anyway, you're not someone
I would throw away.
- I have a job to do.
- Your job is a waste of time.
The world doesn't wanna be saved.
I'm giving you a chance to save one small part of it.
Yourself.
Who are you anyway?
Nobody.
I was brought up in a government training centre to be what I am -
Frankenstein, the best driver on earth. This year.
They use one up, they bring in another.
- But I will be the last of the line.
- Oh, who's kidding who?
I never kid.
Why don't you ever take off that glove?
What's underneath it?
It's my secret.
You and the Swiss doctors again?
There are no Swiss doctors.
Just native... American... know-how.
- Have you checked the oil?
- Yes.
- Have you checked the hydraulics?
- An hour ago.
- Brakes? Tires? Water?
- Yeah, they're OK. Everything's OK.
Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything to sabotage the car.
You get a load of that face?
I wonder if somebody got points for that eye.
Listen, Frankenstein, there's just you, me and Joe left in the race, and...
Well, I just want you to know that whoever wins and whatever happens, it's been really grand racin' with you folks.
I also wanna say that I think you make a real nice couple.
- Thank you, Jane.
- Good luck.
Joe, Myra,
I just wanna say, whatever happens, whoever wins...
Hey, save it for the French.
The cars have started, lined up, and are ready to roll on the last lap.
They're off! Frankenstein...
Holy Chrysler!
Joe has just scored his own pit crew!
You lousy sons of bitches!
That'll teach you!
"Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo, that funny man from Chicago, has scored his own mechanics for 40 points, and is off to catch Calamity Jane and Frankenstein.
Screw you, Joe Viterbo, and your mother!
We'll see who gets to New L.A. first, with the highest score too.
It's coming up on the left.
Forget it.
I'm keeping Frankie in my sights.
He's got five minutes on us, and he's stretching it.
So what? If there's trouble up ahead, he'll find it first.
Oh, yeah. Take a look at your face.
You'll find it first.
You know, Myra, some people might think you're cute.
But me, I think you're one very large baked potato.
Roaring down Motorway 66 towards California,
Frankenstein looks certain to be first across the line.
But Machine Gun Joe is still way ahead on points, and he could win the race even by arriving second in New Los Angeles.
What's your prediction, Grace?
You know, Junior, when Machine Gun Joe was just a little boy in Chicago, he had a pet snake that he used to love to ride over with his tricycle.
- Break out the thermos of hi-pro drink.
- Coming right up.
- Here. I didn't mean to hog it all.
- Thanks. What flavor is it?
- Vanilla.
- Hm. Not my favorite.
This isn't vanilla.
It's peach or something.
Yeah, well, my taste buds got wiped out in the crash of '97.
It's a good thing mine that are still intact.
At least the French can't poison us.
What's Frankenstein's location now?
He's about 50 miles out, Lieutenant, and coming fast.
Goodbye, Mrs. Paine. When you see me again, Frankenstein will be my prisoner and the country will know we must be taken seriously.
- Fury, wait. I'm coming with you.
- No, Mrs. Paine, it's too dangerous.
Nonsense.
I've waited 20 years for this moment.
I know I can't join you on the mission, but I want to see you pull it off with my own eyes.
Couple of turnoffs coming up.
What's the quickest way to New L.A.?
- That's funny.
- What?
I can't... I can't seem to focus my eyes on the map.
I think we stay on 7...
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.
Look at that.
- It's them, isn't it?
- Please... please, stop the car.
Sorry. We're in a race.
Frankenstein, stop right now.
We wanna talk to you.
Stop before I force you to.
I'll bomb you to a halt if I have to.
Annie, help me.
Turn off the engine.
Annie's dead, Mrs. Paine.
He must have killed her.
Now I'm really going to let him have it.
Look at that. The rebels are sure giving it to Frankenstein.
Thank you, rebels.
Mary, I think we got this race won.
- Aren't we gonna help him?
- Are you nuts or something?
I'm getting my ass out of here before they make an emergency landing. Sit down.
Attagirl.
Well, America, there you have it.
Frankenstein has just been attacked by the French air force,
and he's whipped their derrières.
His point total for this one'll be something astronomical.
Machine Gun Joe better watch out.
- Right on schedule.
- Hey, what happened?
I slipped you a 30-minute sleepex.
Didn't want you doing something we would both regret.
Did they attack us?
According to the radio, we were attacked by the French air force.
Was the plane shot down?
Even those Swiss doctors couldn't have helped them.
I'm sorry. I know they were your people.
But I can't let anything stop me now.
They didn't expect you to give up easily.
They were prepared for whatever happened.
Oh, my God, you've been hit!
I'll make it.
I'm sorry things worked out this way.
- It's not over yet.
- I'm afraid it is.
Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It doesn't make any difference what happens to me.
That is the dumbest, sorriest thing
I've ever heard you say.
I don't believe you've got a drop of
Thomasina Paine's blood in your body.
The minute things get rough, you close your eyes and try to drive us off a cliff.
If you'd just stop trying to kill me for a minute, I need your help.
How can you possibly expect me to help you?
You're my navigator.
You're the only one who knows where you're going.
I mean, whose side are you on anyway?
I thought the only thing you cared about was winning the race.
Sure. Only the winner of the race gets to shake hands with Mr. President.
- Is that a grenade?
- A hand grenade.
That handshake is all I've lived for for as long as I can remember.
No, wait a minute.
I don't want you to die.
It's my life's work.
Why do you wanna win this race so bad?
Why do I wanna win this race?
In the name of hate.
One big victory for hate.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!
- Hey, stop. Will you stop the car?
- Shut up! What is that?
It's a hand. Will you stop the goddamn car? Stop the car!
You're going to have to shift the gears for me now.
The only thing that worries me is how am I going to shake hands with Mr. President?
Mr. President's the one who should be worried now.
He's coming! Can you hear that engine?
Still in perfect tune.
Here he is - the one and only three-time winner and sole survivor of the 20th annual Transcontinental Road Race, none other than Frankenstein himself!
And now Mr. President.
Our enemy, the French, have destroyed nearly all our gallant racers.
Just as they have crippled our once-great economy, and wrecked our telephone system.
But even they, in all their evil power, were not able to destroy Frankenstein, who is the embodiment of our national virtue and therefore indestructible.
It is fitting that Frankenstein should be the one chosen by your president to lead you in this war against the French which I now decree.
Frankenstein has been shot!
There is a French spy in our midst!
Guards, seize that woman!
Frankenstein, are you all right?
Annie!
Frankenstein...
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Mr. And Mrs. President Frankenstein - dear friends of mine - can you tell us what your first official acts will be?
I plan to pension off the secret police, restore free elections, end minority privilege, and move the seat of government back to New Los Angeles.
We've been governed from abroad long enough.
Mr. President, is it true that you are now accepting rebels into your government?
Well, since I have accepted one into my house...
President Frankenstein has appointed my great-grandmother, Thomasina Paine, in view of her experience in the field, as the minister for domestic security.
And I plan to deal very harshly with rebels.
Anybody who is unhappy with happiness can go find someplace else to live.
- What about the race?
- The race is abolished.
- Abolished?
- That's right.
We feel that the country no longer needs this gratuitous display of violence to show the world that its virility is still intact.
Mr. President, isn't it true that as a racer your popularity depended on violence?
I'm afraid I shall have to let my press secretary answer that question.
Stop annoying Mr. President with impertinent questions, Junior.
It's the race, man.
President Frankenstein, you can't call off the race.
The American people won't stand for it!
Get out of the way, Junior.
The race is the symbol of everything we hold dear - our American way of life.
Sure, it's violent.
But that's the way we love it.
Violent, violent, violent.
And that's why we love you!
Frank, do we have to listen to this?
No.
As to this matter of violence.
The technique of violence was first developed in 2.000.000 BC
by the Australopithecines.
A tribe of four-foot primates who had no brains to speak of.
But who. Nevertheless. Invented the tomahawk and used it on each other.
This practice led to the enlargement of the brain - another useful weapon.
Yes. Murder was invented even before man began to think.
Now. of course. Man has become known as the thinking animal.
First stage removal. First stage removal.
Streets prohibited to non-permits in one hour.
This conversation with Governor Henry C. Santini...
is brought to you by
Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow...
high-energy vegetable concentrates...
and new, delicious Soylent Green...
the miracle food of high-energy plankton...
gathered from the oceans of the world.
Because of its enormous popularity,
Soylent Green is in short supply.
Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
And now, Governor Santini.
Thank you, Richard. Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be able to talk to the people of the city of New York.
Bullshit.
Hey. What did you dig up in those cases I gave you?
Matthewson... murder.
Out of your jurisdiction, across the city line in Philadelphia.
Chergov, murder.
Went home yesterday.
Donaldson, multiple rape.
Has a record in the Bronx.
Can be extradited.
Get him the hell out of Manhattan.
What about Zolitnikoff?
Well, give me time, will you?
You've been telling me that for the last three days.
Well, I can't locate the files.
I spent hours on it at the Exchange today.
Talked to every other book who was there.
You know, there are 20 million guys out of work in Manhattan alone... just waiting for my job and yours too.
I want to close that case and sign it out.
What the hell kind of miracle do you want of me?
I'm just an ordinary police book, not the Library of Congress.
I don't know why I bother.
Because it's your job.
Besides, you love me.
- That margarine's turned.
- Son of a bitch.
Zolitnikoff, no record.
Matthewson, no jurisdiction.
Chergov, home. And Donaldson, extradite.
Why don't you eat something?
- I'm not hungry enough yet.
- It's not bad.
Tasteless, odorless crud.
You don't know any better.
Oh, for--
You know, when I was a kid... food was food.
Before our scientific magicians poisoned the water... polluted the soil, decimated plant and animal life.
Why, in my day, you could buy meat anywhere.
Eggs, they had. Real butter.
Fresh lettuce in the stores.
I know, Sol. You told me before.
How can anything survive in a climate like this?
A heat wave all year long.
A greenhouse effect.
Everything is burning up.
Okay, wise guy.
Eat some Soylent Green and calm down.
I finished it last night.
I was hungry, damn it.
- I'll hustle some more on Tuesday.
- You do that.
I don't want to get caught in another riot.
Get off. I'll charge up the batteries before I go.
- You'll get a heart attack.
- I should be so lucky.
I've pedaled this damn thing halfway around the world.
You know, I'm getting pretty sick of you.
Yes, but you love me.
Night shift again. I'll be damn late.
So get something to eat.
- What?
- Go with God.
Schmuck.
Gilbert?
Hey, Mr. Donovan.
I have something for you.
Get inside.
Great.
Handmade, isn't that?
Do you have the words straight?
I won't understand them if I live to be 100.
You won't.
Okay.
There!
It's good to hear you laugh.
- Come on and play.
- No, thank you.
- Thank you for the toy.
- I'm glad it amuses you.
Let me do something for you.
Are you ready, Miss Shirl?
It's getting late.
Go ahead.
According to the inventory, we're low on everything.
Okay, but I'm gonna bring you a surprise.
I demolished five saucers with one rocket.
Not bad for an amateur.
- I've got your curfew pass.
- Oh, good. I thought I'd lost it.
That makes it 279 D's and 15 cents.
Call it 279 D's even for Mr. Simonson.
Sign it, Brady.
Mr. Brady?
Think I forgot? I didn't forget.
You asked for something special, and I got it. Come on over here.
How often can I offer a customer something really fantastic?
Look.
Beef, Miss Shirl.
Beef like you've never seen before.
What do you want?
You, Mr. Simonson.
I knew soon.
They told me to say that they were sorry... but that you had become unreliable.
That's true.
They can't risk a catastrophe, they say.
They're right.
Then... this is right?
No, not right.
Necessary.
To who?
To God.
I made the routine check.
He was alive at 10:35.
- What was your name again?
- Charles.
- Charles what?
- Just Charles.
It's perfectly legal.
God, we haven't had any trouble here in years, not years.
The scanners and alarms went out of order last Thursday.
- Come on. Let's have a look.
- Yes, it was Thursday.
The problem is parts.
The original manufacturer's out of business.
Our men fabricate replacements.
Takes them forever, just forever.
Nothing works, not really.
You can't believe the problems I have.
I'll have to tell the other tenants.
What do I do? Call each of them and say
Mr. Simonson in 22A was slaughtered?
Unit scanner and alarm, the best there is.
We should have more guards.
- I told management--
- Wait.
We should have more guards.
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.
Tab Fielding. I was Mr. Simonson's bodyguard.
Furniture?
- Yes.
- Simonson's?
- Personal or building?
- Building.
- Where's Simonson?
- In the living room.
Let's go.
- What was his full name?
- William R. Simonson.
Occupation?
- Rich.
- Rich what?
Lawyer. Politics.
I had the impression he was more or less retired.
Say, does this building have a food inventory?
Yes, sir.
Wouldn't you know?
Get me some booze.
- That's not within your jurisdiction--
- Relax.
You're not working for him anymore.
Your contract's been canceled.
I've been paid to the end of the month.
Get the bottle.
Your boss didn't put up much of a fight.
He wasn't the type.
- Most people like to live.
- If you say so.
You're a dream.
Bourbon! Son of a--
Hey. Where were you, bodyguard, when they were butchering your boss?
- He sent us out shopping--
- Us?
The girl and I. You know, Shirl.
So?
Well, we got back at 11.
I saw the jimmy marks on the door and ran in... but obviously it was--
You know how to write?
Yes.
Why don't you go in the foyer and write me a statement?
Include all your movements tonight and yesterday... and your employment number. Okay?
Okay.
He'd be alive if we hadn't gone out.
Now, you have nothing to regret.
He told us to go.
I think he wanted to die.
It was a stupid, amateur burglar.
Nobody's fault, Shirl.
Honey, it wasn't anybody's fault.
Working on your report?
- I was just trying to--
- Yeah, I know.
Hey, what's your name? Shirl?
Yes.
Come on in here a minute, Shirl.
Come on.
Shut the door.
Let's see your hands.
How many times you been in trouble with the police?
- Never.
- I can't hear you.
Never!
No fresh bruises.
He didn't knock you around, huh?
You're a lucky girl.
- He never hit me.
- What?
He was a gentle man.
He never abused me.
I wished he'd lived forever.
- Unless you were fooling around.
- No.
- With the bodyguard maybe?
- No, I'm straight.
Ask Charles. I don't cheat.
Come on.
I'd never risk my job.
When you came back, did you see the body?
Just for a moment.
- Was it like it is now?
- Yes, like it is.
Yeah?
- Sanitation squad is here.
- Just a minute.
What's your arrangement here?
I stay for the next tenant, if he wants me.
I may have to see you again.
All right.
Okay, Shirl. That's all.
Thorn, I thought they had you on riot control.
Right, Wagner.
Hatcher's got you working a double shift?
Me and everybody else.
- No wonder you look lousy.
- Thanks.
- How do you want him marked?
- Simonson. Murder. Dispose.
- They're full up at waste disposal.
- So check dispatch.
Here. You better sign for him.
- My usual cut?
- You'll get your cut.
Just so we understand.
Where are they taking him?
- What's the difference?
- Tell me, please.
He'll be driven outside the city to a waste disposal plant.
When my grandmother died... there was a ceremony.
- I remember.
- I know.
You got your report?
What about the death benefit?
We hold it, pending next of kin.
There is no next of kin.
You can file a claim in 30 days.
I was thinking of Shirl.
Sure you were.
Hey, Wagner!
Give me a lift home?
Hey, Sol!
What are you doing home?
What time is it?
Paper.
- New paper.
- Have some pencils.
Did you ever see a cake of soap that big?
Courtesy of your next assignment,
William R. Simonson.
Chelsea Towers West.
"Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report...
2015 to 2019."
Two volumes.
- Where in hell did you get all these?
- Off his shelves.
The only reference books he had.
You like them?
I love them.
Do you know how many books were published once upon a time?
When there was paper and power and presses that worked and--
What the hell?
Oh, my God.
This Simonson was a great man.
Love apple.
Isn't that beautiful?
Sol.
Beef?
Oh, my God.
How did we come to this?
Why the hell don't you get out of here?
Go back to your foolish work.
Come on, Sol. Don't take it so big.
Look, we're doing okay.
We're doing fine.
We're doing lousy... just like when I was a boy.
Nobody cares. Nobody tries... including me.
I should have gone home long ago.
Come on. I need you.
Simonson, William R.
Number ACX2167D.
- 200 D's cash or 250 in food coupons?
- Cash, please.
Death benefits, line up at tables one and two.
Death benefits, line up at tables one and two.
Hey, Callahan, busy house tonight, huh?
So we'll double up the Tuesday riot detail here at 62nd tomorrow.
That'll leave us thin up here at 101st, so we'll back up with scoops there.
Got that?
So you finally made it.
- Do you know what time it is?
- You're the one with a watch.
I can't. The damn thing won't run.
Let me see it. Maybe I can fix it again.
Okay.
Oh, let's see. The Matthewson murder....
He's in Philadelphia, out of our jurisdiction.
His wife's been lying.
We'll pick her up if we can find her.
Here. Sign.
Zolitnikoff.
I'm working on it.
Which means you still haven't got a damn thing.
How old is Sol Roth now?
He's doing all right.
He's had it.
It's time for you to get another book.
- I'll make arrangements.
- No.
- Sooner or later.
- Not now.
Well, it's your job.
Simonson.
Supposed to look like he was killed... when he caught some punk burglarizing his apartment.
- Well, what do you say?
- It was an assassination.
Just like that?
One: The alarm system was out of order for the first time in two years.
Two: The bodyguard was conveniently out shopping.
Three: The punk didn't take anything.
And four: The punk was no punk.
He used a meat hook instead of a gun to make it look like a punk.
- What did you take?
- Everything I could lay my hands on.
Well, what's for Mother?
One bill for me, 50 for Kulozik, 50 for you.
Ten for Wagner from your end.
- Simonson must have been big.
- How big?
Enough for Chelsea Towers West.
- Who did the inside work?
- For my money, it's the bodyguard.
- What about the furniture?
- Like grapefruit.
You never saw a grapefruit.
You never saw her.
Come on. Shove.
- You know what I really think?
- What?
I think it's really busted this time.
Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybean!
Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybean!
Hey! Watch where the hell you're stepping!
What may I do for you, sir?
Thorn, 14th Precinct.
We run a clean building here, Mr. Thorn.
- I want to see Tab Fielding.
- Second floor to the right.
- Who's there?
- Police.
Just a minute.
I'm not dressed!
Let me see your badge.
Open up.
All right.
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.
Sorry to make such a racket.
I want to see Mr. Fielding.
He isn't home.
- You Mrs. Fielding?
- I'm Martha Phillips. I live here.
I just met Tab yesterday in connection with a case.
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask him.
- Would you know where he is now?
- No.
When will he be back?
I don't know. He just left.
Swell.
New furniture?
- I've been with him for four years.
- Furniture?
Yes.
Hey, this is really a terrific place.
That's rice.
Yeah, I've seen it before.
Tab does pretty well for himself, doesn't he?
- He's got a good reputation.
- Who with?
- The people he works for.
- Who's that?
You know, Chelsea West.
Yeah. Well, when he gets back, tell him Detective Thorn was here. Okay?
Anything you say.
Come on in here a minute, will you?
Sure.
I haven't seen an incinerator for years.
- Used it lately?
- No, it doesn't work.
What does?
Really a nice place you got here.
Really nice.
Plenty of room to move around.
Yeah.
We were very lucky to get it.
Sorry I had to bust in like this.
You know? Just routine.
- I haven't been very nice.
- You're just fine.
I should have offered you something, Mr. Thorn.
If I'd had the time,
I would've asked for it.
Son of a bitch.
I haven't eaten like this in years.
I never ate like this.
And now you know what you've been missing.
- There was a world once, you punk.
- Yes. So you keep telling me.
I was there. I can prove it.
I know. I know.
When you were young, people were better.
Oh, nuts. People were always rotten.
But the world was beautiful.
It's late.
I gotta get to work.
What have you dug up on Simonson?
I've got a handful of reference work
20 years out of date.
You throw out a name and you expect a miracle.
Simonson, Sol. Report, huh?
Schmuck.
Biographical survey, 2006.
Last one they published.
Simonson, William R.
Born 1954.
Evidently unmarried.
Graduated Yale Law School in 1977.
Principal partner, Simonson,
Borden and Santini.
- Governor Santini?
- Hold still. There's more.
In 1997, he was the director of
Holcox Manufacturing, Norfolk, Virginia.
Specialist in manufacturing freeze-drying equipment... for commercial food processing.
And in 2018...
Holcox was acquired by Soylent... and Simonson became a member of the board.
The board of Soylent?
Your dead one was a very important man.
Soylent controls the food supply for half the world.
- What about those?
- Oh, very technical and highly classified.
Unnumbered copies.
Officially, they don't exist.
Perfect.
- What else do you want?
- Everything.
Well, law, Soylent, oceanography--?
Across the board.
Across--? Oh, that's impossible.
Check the Exchange.
Check the Exchange.
I need you to tell me that?
You know, I was a teacher once, a full professor, a respected man.
Make a special effort, will you, Sol?
This case is for real, for a lot of marbles.
- For who?
- Never mind.
- Don't forget to pick up the water ration.
- I'll do that. I'll die if I don't get water.
Hey.
- Taste that.
- Taste what?
Taste it.
Strawberries?
Hundred and fifty bucks a jar of strawberries.
Thorn.
ID is RC105.
Get me the 14th Precinct.
Thorn, how about paying us a visit?
I can't. I'm following up the Simonson thing.
- Well, what have you got?
- He was a director of Soylent.
- What else?
- Well, right now, somebody's tailing me.
He's damn good at it.
Big deal.
Would you believe bodyguards are buying strawberries for 150 D's a jar?
You'd better report in here right away.
Yes, sir, first thing in the morning.
That was Thorn.
He's a damn good cop.
Appreciate the difficulty, Ed.
But the department wants to cooperate with the governor's office, right?
Whatever you say, sir.
It looks like a fair-complected man... maybe someone close to you, a protector.
And if we refer back to this card back here... if you look at it, the time sequence indicates a three-month period.
The cards indicate a secure trend should follow shortly.
So things are looking up a bit, Kathy.
Thank you.
- Your hair looks beautiful.
- Thank you.
Who is it?
Thorn. Detective Thorn.
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask.
Having a party?
Just my friends.
It's okay.
Ice.
Jeez.
That's great.
It's still over 90 out there.
Hey.
You know, if I had the money,
I'd smoke two, three of these every day.
Come on in here.
On the bed.
This is a nice place, the way it's fixed up.
Perfume.
He was murdered, you know. Assassinated.
Robbery had nothing to do with it.
You understand?
Yes.
- Did he have any relatives?
- I never heard of any.
- Do you know who he worked for?
- No.
- You were with him for three years.
- He never talked about his work.
Did you meet his friends?
Sure, I met some of his friends.
What were their names?
- I was never really introduced, you know.
- Oh, come on, Shirl.
Well, there was a Mr. Lempeter... a man called Tompkins... and somebody called Santini.
That's all I remember.
He didn't bring people up here very often.
Santini's the governor.
So?
Where did you go with Simonson?
No place.
Shopping once in a while.
- Except--
- Except?
He took me to church.
Church?
About a month ago, and then again a few days before he died.
What did he do there?
He prayed.
And he talked to a priest.
That's about all.
- Why would he take you to church?
- He didn't say.
Why do you think?
I think he just wanted to have somebody along.
He was very strange towards the end.
He didn't touch me for months.
And sometimes for no reason at all, he'd start to cry.
I saw him cry more than once.
Old people do that.
Do they?
I can't figure this Simonson.
If I was like him, rich, important... plenty to eat... real bourbon... and a girl like you... you wouldn't see me in church.
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over the building for you.
I'll teach you to break my rules!
Furniture stays in units!
I've told you before.
- No!
- I mean it!
- I'll get rid of the whole--
- Hold it!
I didn't know you were here, Mr. Thorn.
We give them a day off a month.
We don't have to.
And they break every regulation in the book.
You'd think they'd be grateful for what they've got here. Wouldn't you?
I'll tell you, Charlie... they're here because
I called them for questioning.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Don't you believe me, Charlie?
You should have told me.
Why?
Regulations.
You wanna file a complaint?
What do you say, Charlie?
No.
I don't want to do anything unfriendly like that, Mr. Thorn.
I wonder if any of these girls want to file a complaint against you.
Maybe not.
Maybe they want to keep it friendly.
I hope so.
Don't you, Charlie?
Don't you?
Yes.
Get the hell out of here.
Look, maybe we better all go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Charles isn't as bad as some.
Don't you ever get mad?
What for?
I left my stuff in here.
It's still dark.
You could stay a while.
You could wash up.
I'll make you breakfast.
Why should you?
There's plenty of food in the refrigerator.
Charles wouldn't dare make trouble for you now.
I got work.
I don't wanna be alone.
I'm frightened when I'm alone.
There's nothing I can do for you, furniture.
I got nothing to give.
The new tenant is coming to look over the place.
He may not want me.
Well, I got a place, but it's nothing like this.
This is like my home.
I've been here a long time.
You could take a shower and let the water run as long as you like.
You got....
You got hot water here.
Very hot.
Jeez!
I haven't had a hot bath....
I'll rub you down afterwards.
All right.
You turn that air conditioner on all the way.
All the way up. We'll make it cold, like winter used to be.
- What about breakfast?
- Anything you like.
- Strawberries.
- An egg.
- No, strawberries.
- I've never seen strawberries.
All right. An egg then.
Who the hell needs strawberries?
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.
- Hey, Sister.
- Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
- Where's the priest?
- You'll find him over there.
Thorn, Father, 14th Precinct.
My name is Paul.
Have I done something?
No, I'm investigating the murder of Mr. William Simonson.
- Who do you say?
- Simonson.
Quite an important man, a rich man.
I have no recollection.
- You talked to him.
- Did I?
No doubt about it.
A rich man.
Yes, I remember.
We don't see rich people here anymore.
There isn't even enough room for the poor.
There's just too many.
Far too many.
- Fa--
- My memory's eroded.
Chiefly, I assign space to people who need space.
Do you need some space?
I need to know what he said to you.
- Are you sure he's dead?
- Yes.
- Really dead?
- He's dead.
- What did he talk to you about?
- Come back tomorrow. I'm very tired.
Father.
Father, did you hear his confession?
There should be a requiem mass, but there's no room.
- Should I make room?
- This is very important.
I can't help you.
Forgive me. It's destroying me.
- What is?
- The truth.
The truth Simonson told you?
- All truth.
- What is it?
What did he confess?
Sweet Jesus.
- We're closing the Simonson case.
- The hell you say.
You heard me. The Simonson case is officially closed.
Felonious assault. Sign.
Yesterday you agreed it was assassination.
There's been 137 reported murders since then, and we won't solve them either.
I'm not gonna falsify that report.
Got a suspect?
I've got leads.
This isn't somebody you scratch after 24 hours and forget.
I told you there's been a tail on me.
Something stinks here.
- Look, you'll sign this, and I'll bury it.
- Like hell you will.
A member of the board of the Soylent Corporation... was torn apart with a meat hook!
You can't sweep that carcass under the rug.
Who bought you?
You're bought when they pay you a salary.
Who's they?
High and hot. They want this case closed permanently! Sign this!
You sign it!
If I close and somebody higher and hotter wants to know why, it's my job!
Sign it. I'll cover for you.
I won't put my job on the line for you, Hatcher.
Not my damn job!
Hey, big shot.
Hatcher says you're on riot control.
Great. That really makes my day.
This was once called Gramercy Park.
Now it's the only tree sanctuary in New York.
Governor. Sorry to disturb you this way, sir.
Not at all, Donovan. Not at all.
Your secretary told me where to find you.
It's urgent...
- or I wouldn't have come out here.
- I understand.
Now, what is it?
I'm to inform you the board is determined to resolve... the Simonson investigation immediately, sir.
- I thought it was resolved.
- Yes, sir.
But the police officer involved refuses to close the case.
Perhaps because he went to church yesterday.
- What does that mean?
- It was Simonson's church.
The cop spoke 20 minutes with the priest.
So?
The same priest who heard Simonson's confession.
I don't wanna hear any more about it.
I can't hear any more about it.
Just do what you have to do.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It has been six months since my last confession.
A real bargain, folks. Synthetic footgear.
Plastics. Plastic ware.
We have a large assortment of plastic ware.
Some are a little chipped.
Others have hardly any cracks.
Quick-energy yellow Soylent made of genuine soybeans.
Soylent crumbs! Two D's a kilo.
Nothing cheaper in the market. Come and get it.
Soylent buns!
Get your genuine Soylent buns!
Keep moving right along.
Soylent Green. Soylent Green right here.
They gave me a quarter of a kilo.
I stood in line the whole lousy day, and they gave me a quarter of a kilo!
Do you believe that?
Let me go! Are you gonna put up with this?
They're running out of the damn green.
- Idiots.
- Some foul-up at transport.
- This crowd will blow.
- I know.
Got the scoops standing by, but I don't know if they can handle this.
When you gonna make the announcement?
As soon as I get up the nerve.
About five minutes, I guess.
Better pass the word.
Right.
This is the police.
This is the police. This is the police.
I am asking you to disperse.
The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
You must evacuate the area.
The scoops are on their way.
The scoops are on their way!
I repeat: The scoops are on their way.
Today is Tuesday!
Why would you leave that door open?
Mr. Fielding.
- Why did you set up Simonson?
- I didn't.
You're all there is.
- Who pays your bills?
- I do.
Oh, no. I won't hit a cop. Bastard.
Yeah, I know.
You get life for that, jerk!
Life in a waste disposal plant in a Soylent factory someplace.
How about that big, fat Soylent Corporation?
Do you work for them like Simonson did?
How much did they pay you for that one?
Does Soylent buy your strawberries?
Anybody tails me, bothers me one more time...
I'll come back here and kill you both.
Got it?
Get off my back!
Thorn.
I was worried about you.
- What happened?
- Never mind.
It doesn't matter.
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.
- Good evening.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.
- Mr. Roth.
- Evening.
Good evening, Your Honor.
I assume you have a priority police problem.
Yes, Your Honor.
It's about William Simonson.
And... these.
Thorn.
Thorn. It's curfew.
How do you feel?
A lot better.
I did the best I could... but I still think you should go see the police doctor.
He might relieve me from duty.
You need a rest.
More than two days, and I lose my job.
- We could go to another city.
- What for?
They're all like this.
- The country?
- That's not allowed.
Those farms are like fortresses.
- Why?
- Good land's gotta be guarded... the way they guard the waste disposal plants... and Soylent factories and the plankton ships.
You know, there are idiots in this world who wanna take everything we've got.
- Maybe Simonson was one of them.
- I don't believe it.
It means there's no place for us to go.
That's right.
Why should we?
You be careful now.
Keep the scanners on.
Don't go anyplace without a bodyguard.
The new tenant comes tonight.
He'll like you.
You're a hell of a piece of furniture.
Don't talk to me like that.
Please.
Okay.
It's horrible.
You must accept it.
I see the words, but I can't believe them.
Believe.
The evidence is overwhelming.
- Simonson was a member of the board.
- Yeah.
He learned these facts, and they shook his sanity.
The corporation knew... he was not reliable anymore.
They feared he might talk... and so he was eliminated.
- Then why are they doing this?
- Because it's easier.
I think "expedient" is the word.
What we need is the proof of what they are doing... before we bring it to the Council of Nations.
Good God.
What God, Mr. Roth?
Where will we find him?
Perhaps at home.
Yes, at home.
I waited two whole damn years for an apartment to open up in this building.
It's a nice place.
- How long have you been here?
- A long time.
How old are you?
Twenty-one.
Charles said you were 24.
That makes us both liars.
All right.
All right.
I sleep late.
I like a big breakfast and no lunch.
I'll organize the dinner menu.
Three or four times a week,
I have guests.
Sometimes it's business, and then we have to be alone.
Sometimes it's fun, and then we like a girl who's fun.
Are you fun?
May I help you, sir?
- It feels good.
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?
And your favorite color?
Orange, I guess.
- Music?
- Classical.
- Light classical.
- I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
Sign here, please, Mr. Roth.
- A full 20 minutes?
- Oh, certainly. Guaranteed.
Thank you.
This way, please, Mr. Roth.
Good evening, ma'am.
May I have your name, please?
Well, I see that orange is your favorite color.
- You want Mr. Solomon Roth?
- That's right.
This way, please.
My God.
It's truly unfortunate that you missed the overture.
- I want to see him.
- That is prohibited during the ceremony.
Well, I can assure you--
Open that damn thing right now... or I swear to God you'll die before he does.
All right! All right.
Sol, can you hear me?
- Thorn?
- Yes.
Thank you for coming.
- Oh, dear God.
- I've lived too long.
No.
I love you, Thorn.
I love you, Sol.
Can you see it?
Yes.
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, yes.
I told you.
How could I know?
How could I?
How could I ever imagine?
Horrible.
Simonson.
Soylent.
Listen to me, Thorn.
Thorn, listen.
I can't hear him.
Do something, damn it!
Yes, Sol.
You've got to prove it, Thorn.
Go to the Exchange.
Please, Thorn.
You've got to prove it, Thorn.
The Exchange.
Go to....
Hey!
- Dispatch.
- Thorn, ID RC105.
Get me the 14th Precinct. Urgent.
Just a moment.
- The circuit is in use.
- Well, break in!
It's a 6-1 priority.
Look, get me Chelsea Towers West.
Apartment 22A.
- Cut in if you get the 14th.
- Understood.
- Hello?
- Shirl, it's me.
Oh, Thorn, I'm so glad.
I have to talk to you.
No, there's no time.
- The new tenant wanted me.
- Good. Stay with him.
I want you to stay with him always.
Oh, Thorn, I want to live with you.
Just live.
- I have Lt. Hatcher.
- Plug him in.
Thorn?
Thorn.
- Thorn, where the hell have you been?
- I'm at the Exchange.
Hatcher, help me.
There's another one over there.
- Hey, punk, are you with us?
- Hatcher.
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, you got him, all right.
You don't listen too good, but you're a damn good cop.
Hatcher... get to the Exchange.
You gotta tell them they're right.
But let's take care of you first.
You don't understand.
I've got proof.
They need proof.
I've seen it. I've seen it happening.
They've gotta tell people.
- Tell them what?
- The ocean's dying. Plankton's dying.
It's people.
Soylent Green is made out of people.
They're making our food out of people.
Next thing, they'll be breeding us like cattle for food.
You've gotta tell them.
You've gotta tell them.
I promise, tiger. I promise.
I'll tell the Exchange.
You tell everybody.
Listen to me, Hatcher.
You've gotta tell them!
Soylent Green is people!
We've gotta stop them somehow!

On Blueberry Hill
Can I help?
Yes. I hope so.
I want to sell this.
Uh, where'd you get this ring?
It's mine.
My wife gave it to me.
Look. The initials are on the inside.
Yes?
- "T.J.N."
- Yeah.
Do you have your I.D.?
I'm British.
I have a passport.
- "Thomas Jerome Newton."
- The wind in the willows played
- Love's sweet melody
- This is not a pawnshop.
I beg your pardon?
If I buy this ring now, you can't redeem it later.
- Understand?
- I understand.

You're part of me still

Oliver.
Oliver, Mr. Newton is here.
I'm Oliver Farnsworth.
Would you like a scotch and water or something, Mr. Newton?
Oh, a glass of water.
[Man]
Fine.
- Would you like a scotch?
- Yes, please.
Are you all right?
Just tired.
I'm sorry I didn't have time to see you at my office today, Mr. Newton.
I had hardly even 10 minutes.
- [Phone Rings]
- [Man] Excuse me.
What's this?
Some kind of bribe?
I'm paying you for your time.
As from now, I want at least 10 hours at $ 1,000 an hour.
Mr. Newton, this kind of money buys more than 10 hours even of my time.
What exactly do you want?
I want a lawyer who's well versed in paten — patents.
That's me.
Here.
Electronics.
- Read the file.
- [Phone Ringing]
May I keep it overnight?
I'm sorry.
I can't leave it with you.
It's not that
I don't trust you.
All right. I'll read it.
If you want to put a record on, Mr. Newton... music doesn't disturb me.
Oh, no, thank you.
Well, if there's anything you want, just ask.
[Clock Chiming]
[Siren wailing]
[Electronic Twittering]
[Farnsworth]
I don't believe it.
I can't believe it.
You have nine basic patents here.
Nine.
That's basic patents.
Do you know what that means?
- [Newton] Yes, I think so.
- Do you really?
I wonder.
It — It means, Mr. Newton, that you can take RCA...
Eastman Kodak and DuPont, for starters.
In, say, three years, what would this be worth to me?
I'm a lawyer, not an accountant,
Mr. Newton.
But I'd say it must be something in the area of...
$300 million.
- Not more?
- More?
- I need more.
- What the hell for?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
It's just I'm trying to adjust my mind to all this.
I'll offer you 10% of my net profits... plus five percent of all corporate holdings.
[Sighs]
I must think about it all.
I'll ask Trevor to take you home.
I don't drive.
Thank you. I have my own driver waiting.
- All night?
- If you take this assignment... you'll have complete authority, below me.
I don't want to have contact with anyone except you.
When you take this position,
Mr. Farnsworth... you'll be able to replace your antiquated sound equipment and buy some of mine.
- Buy it?
- At cost, naturally.
[Darnsworth] Perhaps you're not so different after all, Mr. Newton.
Arthur, would you please slow down?
We're only doin' 45,
Mr. Newton.
It's making me feel dizzy.
Keep to 30, please.
[Farnsworth]
My father used to say, "Oliver...
"when you get a gift horse, walk up to it...
"pat it, quiet the animal down...
"and then, using both hands, force open its jaws... and have a damned good look in its mouth."
I'd say that was good advice.
Yes. But my father was always wrong.

[Darnsworth Narrating]
It happened literally overnight.
When Mr. Newton came into my apartment... my old life went straight out the window.
In no time at all,
I got a brand-new life, and I like it.
Maybe I'm not my own boss the way I used to be... but... so what?
Oliver, you're the president of one of the largest corporations in America.
[Chuckles]
I'll tell you one thing. It's never too late.
I didn't think a man could change at my age.
I still can't believe it.
- [Typing]
- [Darnsworth] Yes, that's possible.
We can do that.
Are you sure this is the right moment, Mr. Newton?
You know, don't you, that this one has virtually no bottom?
- [Seagull Squawking]
- [Waves Crashing]
No. No.
I want you to begin negotiations with Eastman Kodak immediately.
[Farnsworth]
We've been together a long time now... and I don't see why you'd even consider selling off this division.
Well, I mean, if I owned a copyright on the Bible...
I wouldn't sell it to Random House.
It's what I want.
I'm on my way to New Mexico now.
I shall be staying at an hotel near the border.
I can't tell you yet.
I'll be in touch.
Results are results, Nate, and your class is way below par.
- [Chuckles]
- I have the computer statement right here.
And, uh — [Chuckles]
It's kind of sad.
The campus computer, I gather?
- That damn thing doesn't have a mind.
- It's not meant to have a mind.
- That's what makes it perfect for this place, right?
- [Grumbles]
Oh, the company that made that self-developing film that I showed you a while ago?
They've, uh — They've made this announcement.
They're — They're dumping computers.
They're installing human beings.
- Oh, really.
- Want to know why?
They want to bring back human error... because that's the way you get new ideas — by making mistakes.
Back to man and his imagination.
If you can't spot a piece of bullshit commercial publicity when you hear it... you're even more naive than I thought.
Keep your mind on yourjob.
- That's my advice.
- That's your advice to me?
- Yeah.
- You're so fucking smug and ignorant, you don't know what's going on.
- Oh, really?
- These kids are bored.
They're bored with you and these fucking textbooks.
They're five years out of date.
I mean —
[Chuckles]
What they need is some real stimulus.
- Ideas to pursue.
- Yes, well... we've had enough of your pursuits.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the things you pursue, Nate.
Young things.
I don't know. Maybe it's your age.
You've become a novelty freak, and you're not that young anymore.
You don't even get it, do you?
I'm younger than most of those kids.
- Oh, come on!
- They're already middle-aged because that's what they're taught.
Well, I want out.
- That's the fact.
- Face the facts.
What the hell else can you do now except teach?
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.
Tell you what. Why don't you go get a job with that great company of yours?
I believe I will.
I believe you won't.

Mmm.
[Sighs]
- Hello.
- [Laughing]
- You know, you're not at all like my father.
- I'm glad about that.
[Siren wailing]
You know, you're not a bit like my father.
I'm glad about that.
[Mutters]
- You've got more little wrinkles.
- Mmm.
You have a lot of lines on your forehead and wrinkles.
[Girk In Distorted Voice]
And things.
- And things.
- [Mumbling]
- And more things.
- That's why you torment me.
- I'm probably older than your dad.
- Probably so.
That's why you tease me so much, isn't it? Huh?
Well, I'm not a lecherous old man.
You're a lecherous little girl.
But no one would ever believe it!
- Come on. Nobody would ever believe you.
- [Mumbles]
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah.
Fuck Professor Canutti!
Fuck you!
- [In Distorted Voice] Fuck you!
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Fuck Canutti.
- [Girl] Yeah. Nobody would believe you.
Do you think I could have something to drink?
Are you sure you should drink?
- I'd like a glass of—
- Gin?
A nice gin and tonic... with four cubes of ice and a slice of lime.
How's that sound, mister?
- Just a glass of water.
- No, no.
I'll get it.
Do you want me to go down and get some medicine?
Maybe you should have something with your water.
Some kind of pill maybe?
Just the water.
What's your name?
Sussex.
Um, can I leave now?
I've got some cleaning to do.
I'll come back in a little while, okay?
You go ahead.
I'm all right.
[Door Closes]
And then, when I was 15...
I worked in this pharmacy in a hospital... delivering medicine to all the floors.
It was a real responsible job.
Boy, you're really hooked on water, aren't you?
One of these days you oughta try one of these.
Am I talking too much?
Maybe I oughta go.
[Sighs]
Oh, Lord, it's after 3:00.
I guess you're tired.
Well, I'll just finish this up and then —
And then?
And then I think
I'll have another one.
You know, I really like you, mister.
What do you do?
For a living, I mean.
Oh, I'm just visiting.
Oh, a traveler!
Could you help me up, please?
Sure.
Oh.
You know, mister,
I don't think you get enough to eat.
If you don't mind my saying so...
I think you're too thin.
You're very thin.
You're too thin!
Do you come from a city?
No, I come from the country.
Ah.
- I wish I lived in the country.
- [Toilet Flushes]
You know, this is a very unhealthy place.
Water here is all polluted.
They put all kinds of chemicals in it to keep people from gettin' sick.
It's a very unhealthy place.
I think it just takes getting used to. That's all.
It sure does.
- Anyway, I —
- I wonder —
I wonder if you'd mind,
Mary-Lou, if I rested now.
[Laughs]
Lord, no.
I was just leaving anyway.
I'll come back and see you tomorrow, if you want me.
I'd like to see you tomorrow.
Perhaps you could arrange to bring me a television.
TV? Nothin' easier.
[Sighs]
Well, I'll be seeing you then, Mr. —
- Sussex.
- Sussex.
I don't know why, but I'll never be able to remember that name.
Good night.
Thank you, Mary-Lou.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Just say you love me like you used to
- [Sighs]
- And make the world go away
[Mary-Lou Narrating]
They always seem to lead such interesting lives...
- people who travel.
- Make the world go away
People who write stories must lead kind of interesting lives too.
- Get it off my shoulder
- I know I'll never be like a character in a story.
I'll just be like everybody else.
Well, maybe, maybe, maybe.
I don't know.
- Maybe someday.
- And make the world go away
[Farnsworth On Phone] There are now six subsidiaries under the holding company.
I don't know how accurate you want the account figures, but they change hourly.
Yes, we receive bank statements on each company twice a day.
I want the total figure by tomorrow.
Give it to me to the nearest
$50 million.
And the utility dropped very slightly.
The volume, 11,850,000 shares.
The average issues up —
The more secretive you are about your life... the more it arouses people's interest.
We've had some chemistry professor from Chicago... who's been calling and writing.
[Newton On Speakerphone]
That's not so terrible, Mr. Farnsworth.
- [Man On TV, Indistinct]
- Why don't you talk to him? Don't be unfriendly.
- Mary-Lou.
- [Man On TV] 686 issues up. 568 down.
My life is not secret, Mr. Farnsworth, but it is private.
[Man On TV]
Among the most actives today is World Enterprises.
Up five points on the day, trading over 300,000 shares.
Wall Street analysts and company officials report... they know of no reason for the sudden interest —
[Nate Narrating] For a whole year
I concentrated equally on two things:
Fucking and World Enterprises.
It was neck and neck.
Well, I have to admit that I —
It began to look like Canutti was right because World Enterprises... was evasive and slow to reply to my persistent letters and calls and —
Suddenly, I got this letter from Farnsworth.
I'd landed a job in the research department of the fuel division.
Strangely, after that...
I gradually began to lose my interest in 18-year-olds.
I don't know what happened to me.
I'm not sure.
But my mind had developed a libido of its own... and I didn't need the stimulation of legs and so forth.
The salary was terrific too.
It was three times what I'd been getting.
The first thing I did is I ordered a French car.
This upset Canutti more than anything else.
Last time I remember feeling so exhilarated... was 10 years back when I'd been experimenting with heat photography.
It came to nothing, of course, because academia got in the way.
But this time...
I knew I was gonna be given a proper chance.
And you know how I knew that?
Because I had faith in myself.
What I didn't know then... was someone else had faith in me as well.
[Man On P.A.]
This will be your final call.
Continental Airlines,
Flight 231, the GoldenJet... nonstop for El Paso, ready for immediate departure —
[Man On P.A. Continues, Indistinct]
[Man On P.A.]
...service to Tucson and Phoenix.
Dr. Bryce.
I'm Oliver Farnsworth.
Um, I thought you were based in New York.
New York?
Oh, uh, not anymore.
I still keep an apartment there.
I've come to like it out here.
I think you will too.
It's got a lot of... space.
That means freedom.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I do.
Then there's the job itself.
It will entail certain, uh —
Uh —
Well, you won't live in quite the same way as you did before.
Of course, there's the salary.
- Another adjustment.
- I know this is what I want.
I hope so.
[Violin On TV]
[Man On TV] The sun is roughly
10,000 times larger than Earth.
[Woman On TV]
Anyway, I'm rather glad you're leaving tonight.
- [Man On TV] You are?
- Makes everything so much simpler.
That's the way it should be — no involvements, no complications.
- No danger.
- None at all.
Hello, Tommy.
I got that white wine you like from Reichman's.
It's not cold.
You want me to pour you a glass?
- Why not?
- [Man On TV] I suppose most girls are sentimental about their first love.
[Woman On TV]
Oh, I suppose so.
Like their first pair of high-heeled shoes.
I don't understand how you can watch them all at the same time.
You know, Tommy, you're really a freak.
I don't mean that unkindly.
I like freaks.
That's why I like you.
[Woman On TV]
Let me see. Uh —
I really like you.
[Man On TV] Trouble is, people get too attached to each other, things drag on.
Scenes, tears.
Everything gets so maudlin.
I think people should always behave... as though they were between planes.
- Very sound, Mr. Flannagan.
- Face it.
"He who loves and runs away lives to love another day."
- But it's not enough.
- [Woman On TV] I must remember that.
I don't know why you're living with me. Oh —
You don't need me.
Yes, I do.
First we'll have a drink.
Then I'll have a bath.
And tomorrow, we'll go to church.
[Woman On TV]
It's all a little blurry.
- Lord, I love gin.
- Must have had too much of this domestic champagne.
- I can't go to church.
- Oh, come on, Tommy.
It's a real good church.
You won't feel out of place.
Makes me feel so good.
Gives me something to believe in.
Everybody needs that — a meaning to life.
I mean, when you look out at the sky at night... don't you feel that somewhere out there... there's gotta be a god?
There's gotta be.
[Violins]
[Violins Continue]
[Ends]
They're so strange here — the trains.
Damn cheap rinses.
You can come in, Tommy.
Don't be embarrassed.
Are you hiding out?
Well, then how come you told me your name was Mr. Sussex?
I didn't know you then.
- Are you married?
- Yes.
Thought so.
What's she like, your wife?
Is she like me?
No.
Didn't think so.
Well, I guess I'll do for now, won't I?
[Organ]
We've handed song sheets out today... of an old English hymn... which I'd like you all to try and attempt to sing... for a friend of ours.
- [Organ]
- Stand, please.
And did those feet
In ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green
And was the holy
Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon
Our clouded hills
And was Jerusalem
Builded here
Among these dark satanic —
[Ballad]
Try to remember
The kind ofSeptember
When life was slow
And oh so mellow
Try to remember
The kind ofSeptember
When grass was green
And grain so yellow
Try to remember
The kind ofSeptember
When you were young
And a callow fellow
Try to remember
And if you remember
Then follow
Follow
[Daint, Distorted Chattering]
[Train Whistle Blowing]
Tommy. Tommy, look. A train.
I like trains. I remember when Mama used to put us on the train.
I was about 10.
And we'd go to Oklahoma City to visit Granny.
The trains were really nice then.
They had concession stands... and they would sell, uh, magazines... and candy bars and sodas and —
Then, about six years later...
I rode the train again... and the concession stands were gone.
There weren't too many people on the train.
There weren't any dining cars, and the seats were all shabby.
It's a shame.
I used to like trains.
What do you want to take a picture of that for?
[Newton]
For my scrapbook.
I love our rides in the country.
Don't you, honey?
[Banjo]
- What?
- Nothing.
- [Banjo]
- Pa! Look at that! Pa! Look!
[Banjo]
Lord, I never knew
America was so beautiful.
This is beau-ti-ful.
How did you find this place?
- Shall we build the house here?
- The house?
Oh, yes, yes.
Definitely yes.
It's perfect.
It is perfect.
Perfect.
[Newton]
It's perfect.
You all right, Tommy?
Tommy?
- Tommy?
- [Wind Whistling]
Tommy! Arthur!
[Wind Whistling]
Arthur!
What was it? What did you see?
You saw something.
- [Arthur] You all right, sir?
- I think we ought to get Mr. Newton back to the car.
He's not a well man.
What was that?
Are you sure?
[Thunder Rumbling]
Tomorrow morning I want you to start work on a completely new project, Mr. Farnsworth.
I want the complete resources of World Enterprises at my disposal.
What is the nature of this project, Mr. Newton?
You'll have to recruit some new men.
Get yourself some sleep,
Mr. Farnsworth.
Good night.
What does that mean?
- It's fantastic.
- What is?
Starting tomorrow... we are embarking on some sort of space program.
Space program?
What for?
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust you.
That doesn't alter my feeling for you.
Has he ever been wrong?
No, but he's a freak.
What do you see in the cards?
Nothing.
[Helicopter Whirring]
[Laughing]
Don't forget your bag.
- Hey, thanks. That was great.
- Okay, sure.
- That all?
- That's it.
- Dr. Bryce?
- Yeah.
Your car's right outside the gate.
- Dr. Bryce?
- Yeah.
I've come to take you to your laboratory and quarters.
Uh, I thought I was gonna work here.
It's not far, sir, and it's much more comfortable.
I've been shuttled around so much by this corporation, I should be used to it by now.
Thank you.
Is that Mr. Farnsworth's house?
No, sir. That belongs to Mr. Newton.
I can't seem to get dry.
Mmm. I'm still wet.
- I've got something for you.
- Oh, yeah? What?
A present?
You know you don't buy people presents.
Call it a prize.
A prize? What for?
I don't know.
Come on. I'll show you.
What kind of prize?
- It's yours, Mary-Lou.
- Oh, my Lord!
Move over.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Let me look.
- Let me dry that.
- Hair's sticking up.
I know. You saw me looking in that magazine, didn't you?
It's all dark.
I love you.
You're such a nice man.
- Mmm!
- No, I'm not.
[Whispering]
You want it puffy or tight?
- Puff it out a bit more.
- Okay.
I don't know if it looks good tight.
These are hard to stick in.
- Mmm. Where, where, where?
- What?
- Here?
- What?
- Oh! [Laughing]
- What?
[Light Rock]
A new suit came in.
It's not your color. It's blue.
- No.
- It's exactly the same style.
No, no.
- Damn it.
- No, I don't like it.
All right.
Well, I'll send it back.
- Come on, Tommy. You've had enough.
- I don't want to talk to anyone.
[Continues]
[Sighs]
Tommy.
Tommy, what's happened to you?
- What's happened to me?
- [Ends]
What is this music Farnsworth keeps sending me? I don't like it.
Some German composer.
I'd like to hear people singing.
Let's have... singing.
- Find some singing.
- People singing.
[Light Pop]
I feel so bad
I've got a worried mind
- Let's talk.
- I'm so lonesome
All the time
Oh, don't turn on those damn TVs.
Come on, Tommy.
Talk to me.
Oh, I can't stand what's happening to you, whatever it is.
Why don't you just tell me?
The sun don't shine
[Sobs]
I hate — No, I don't.
- [Sobbing]
- [Woman Laughing On TV]
- [Overlapping Voices On TVs]
- I love you.
- Come what may, to Blue Bayou
- [Gunfire On TV]
Therefore the court sentences the aforementioned
William Budd of the Royal Navy... to die by hanging on the first watch of the day, following these proceedings.
Bayou
All those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
All right. Here we go.
Since you are in college, and since you know the alphabet... and since this is the first day of class... we will begin by —
[Overlapping Voices]
- Be with some of my friends
- [Whinnies]
- Maybe I'll be happy then
- Up against the wall, mother —
Come on! Come on!
Holy Moly!
[Man On TV]
Prisoner, have you anything to say?
If you have nothing to say, the sentence of the court will be carried out.
[Overlapping Voices]
We modified our body... and our engine and used someone who didn't weigh much to drive...
- and we got 84 miles per gallon.
- Is anything wrong?
Wrong? This man is completely insane!
That's what's wrong.
[Pop]
Get out of my mind, all of you!
[Overlapping Voices]
[Overlapping Voices Continue]
Leave my mind alone.
By authority of His Gracious Majesty,
George Rex —
I'm putting the stick... forward.
Stay where you belong.
Go away, back where you belong.
God bless Captain Vere.
- Back where you came from.
- Sound off.
[Yelling]
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing, you maniac?
All of you!
Corrected... my position... by putting the stick forward.
- [Phone Rings]
- Oh, hello.
Mr. Farnsworth.
Yeah, it's Bryce.
Is everything all right?
Well, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm baffled.
I've been here for so long, and I —
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
Oh, uh, and, Mr. Farnsworth, about this, uh... liquid gas problem, I —
I really must tell ya, I can't —
I'm afraid I know nothing about liquid gas, Dr. Bryce.
What I've called to tell you is that Mr. Newton will be visiting you the day after tomorrow.
Yes. Wednesday.
He will be able to answer all of your questions.
No, I'm afraid... he's away at the moment.
Ah. Well, thanks for calling,
Mr. Farnsworth.
[Phone Clatters In Cradle]
[Cricket Chirping]
- [Bird Squawking]
- [Chirping Continues]
Tomorrow, Dr. Bryce.
- Huh? Who are you?
- Don't be suspicious.
[Splash]
[Creaks]
- Hmm?
- Mr. Newton sent me to collect you.
This way, Dr. Bryce.
Mr. Newton has been away, hasn't he?
Yes, sir.
He come in this mornin'.
[Engine Starts]
[Wings Flapping]
[Arthur]
Mr. Newton is waitin: Sir.
Dr. Bryce? I'm Newton.
- We've met before. I —
- [Door Closes]
Mm-hmm.
How are you getting on?
Have you found your feet yet?
Well, not yet.
Not — Not really.
Well, I'm here to help you.
[Engine Starts]
I believe we — we share a common interest,
Mr. Newton: Photography.
Hmm. My interest is energy.
Transference of energy.
Oh.
- Transference of energy.
- Yes.
Well, I know it's gonna be very exciting working with you. I —
I've looked forward to meeting you.
I've thought about you once or twice.
This — This is some kind of space vehicle, right?
Well, what for?
Is it a solar probe?
I want you to think beyond that.
I want to show you this because I value your contribution to my work.
Well, I'm not certain what that's to be.
Fuel conservation, Dr. Bryce.
It may be the key to our project.
- Ask me.
- What?
The question you've been wanting to ask ever since we met.
Are you Lithuanian?
I come from England.
Oh, that's not so terrible.
Is this a weapon?
- A weapon?
- Well, it's too small for interplanetary travel.
You assume that it's a weapon?
- Does that matter to you?
- Yeah.
If I thought that you were building a weapon... you were employing me to help you,
I'd have to quit the project.
Don't be s — suspicious.
I know people think me unnecessarily secretive.
If I were you,
I'd be secretive.
Would you be comfortable in here?
I think I'd last about 20 minutes.
And then?
I'd start screaming.
Wouldn't everyone?
Last night, I was watching television.
I saw these, uh, ex-astronauts.
Some of them are basket cases now.
Television.
The strange thing about television is that it... doesn't tell you everything.
[Newton]
It shows you everything about life on Earth... but the true mysteries remain.
Perhaps it's in the nature of television.
Just waves in space.
Do you trust me, Dr. Bryce?
I think so.
- That's not good enough.
- It's the best I can do.
Let's put it this way.
Uh, I want to.
You see, Mr. Newton, I'm kind of a cliche.
I'm the disillusioned scientist.
That goes with the cynical writer, the alcoholic actor and the spaced-out spaceman.
A man like you wouldn't understand a guy like me.
I'll try to, Dr. Bryce.
Well, anyhow, uh...
"Per ardua ad astra."
I beg your pardon?
That's Latin.
Latin?
You must know that in England.
- Royal Air Force — their motto.
- Yes.
"Per ardua... ad astra."
"Through difficulties, to the stars."
[Man]
It's very hot today.
[Farnsworth]
I appreciate your coming all this way to see me.
Would you say we're getting close to an understanding?
I'm afraid not, Mr. Peters.
That's a pity.
We seem to have spent so much time on this question.
You must understand,
World Enterprises sees itself as a loner... a pioneer, if you will.
We have that get-up-and-go spirit.
Frankly, what you're suggesting sounds like interference.
I beg you to reconsider,
Mr. Farnsworth.
The world is ever-changing, like our own solar system... and a corporation the size of yours has a duty to recognize that fact.
[Faint Static]
One must keep up,
Mr. Farnsworth.
The way I see it,
Mr. Peters, I'm way ahead.
It's going to be hard.
I'm concerned about the recovery program.
Don't be.
"Don't be"?
Mr. Newton, are you crazy?
- [Helicopter Whirring]
- [Man Speaking Foreign Language]
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Humming]
Same as before?
[Man On TV] So many good and worthwhile products from World Enterprises.
Gin. Uh, neat, no ice.
- Right?
- That's it.
[Man On TV]
We help you to a better life.
[Synthesized]
W.E. Film turns a little moment into a great event.
- [Synthesized]
- [Distorted Voice, Indistinct]

The colors are beautiful.
The film is W.E.
It has to be.
[Man On TV]
We do it for you.
Free camera with each 12-pack.
- A division of World Enterprises.
- Turn it off.
W.E. Film is self-loading, self-focusing —
- [Humming]
- Self-exposing. Self-developing.
- No light necessary.
- Is there a malfunction?
- We do it for you.
- No, I don't think so.
- May I see it?
- With W.E. Film, what you see is what you get.
Sometimes it doesn't seem to work.
I gotta get some ice.
[Synthesized]
And, remember, don't throw your W.E. camera away.
If your camera should break, just drop it in your nearest W.E. litter bin.
It will be recycled for you.
World Enterprises works for you, for us.
It's a great partnership.
WE and US.
World Enterprises and the United States, together.
[Thunder Rumbling]
...result of the same cold front that brought heavy snow to the Rockies earlier this week.
Hardest hit by the wet weather have been the Southwestern states... including Texas, Nevada,
Arizona and New Mexico.
New storm predictions have been issued for other areas as well.
- A low pressure system moving —
- May I look at it?
- Hmm? Oh, sure.
...is bringing thunder showers there... as you can see from a spiral band of clouds.
And the bright clouds over Minnesota and lowa —
There's yet another stormy area in western Texas, Oklahoma —
Seems to be all right now.
...ahead of a trough over the eastern Rockies.
Why does the guy on the, uh,
W.E. commercial look like you?
Funnel clouds, hail and 100-mile-an-hour winds —
Does he? Hmm.
He's just a family man.
Our W.E. products appeal to families.
Are you a family man?
- Where are they?
- They live in Los Angeles.
Why aren't you with them?
I'm separated from my wife, but I see my daughter.
A man should spend time with his family.
Hmm.
[Thunderclaps]
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Man]
In these circumstances, we have to take action.
Well, I talked with Farnsworth.
- He just cannot, or will not, see it our way.
- [Chuckles]
The problem with this corporation is that it is, uh, technologically overstimulated.
And the economic trouble stems from that fact.
Then you must go further.
They have to take a wider view.
What kind of measure would you say is appropriate?
Well, we're flexible.
Something, uh, elastic.
But, remember, we're not the mafia.
This isn't an archaic
Italian joke.
We're determining the social ecology.
This is modern America, and we're going to keep it that way.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, okay.
Tell me. How long will it take to complete the fuel tank?
[Sighs]
You mean... to construct and all?
- Everything. How long?
- About 15 months.
[Scoffs]
That's too long.
It's too long.
[Bryce]
Why? Why is it too long?
- [Newton] You put alcohol in my drink.
- [Bryce Laughs]
Fuck.
[Buzzing]
[Newton]
You can stay on here. The house is yours.
I've transferred enough to your bank account.
I don't want the house or your money.
I want to be with you.
I can't explain it to you completely.
But if I stay here...
I shall die.
What do you mean?
Take me with you.
I'll see you don't die.
I can't stay.
You're an alien!
Do you know what would happen if they found out your visa had expired?
You don't know.
How could you? You're simple.
You don't understand how we live here.
Oh, come on, Tommy.
Don't go now.
Give us another chance.
You won't find anyone else like me, you know.
You won't find anyone who'd do for you like I've done for you.
It's your wife, isn't it?
I bet you she's no bloody good.
Ooh.
I don't care what you are or who you are, I —
No! I can't let you go! Not now!

Why?

Why?
Why? Why?
[Sobbing]
You must hate me.
No, I don't.
I don't hate anyone.
I can't.
Your wife's out there somewhere.
She's waiting for you, isn't she?
And your children — they must miss their dad.
What are they like, your children?
They're like children.
Exactly like children.

- Hello, Mr. Newton.
- Hello, Dr. Bryce. I'm glad you came.
I hoped you would.
I realize you've made certain assumptions about me.
I can see the flash of an X-ray camera.
It's blinding.
Why'd you come here?
Where I come from, there's a terrible drought.
We saw pictures of your planet on television.
We saw the water.
In fact, our word for your planet means "planet of water."
You watched it all on television?
Where exactly do you come from?
Well, I'm not an astronomer, but... somewhere down there.
Are you the — the first?
The first what? Visitor?
There have always been visitors.
On my own planet we found evidence of visitors.
You must have seen them here.
No, I don't think so.
Well, I've seen them.
I've seen their footsteps and their places.
I've seen those things.
We've all seen them. That's for theorists.
- I'm a scientist.
- Well, I'm not a scientist.
But I know all things begin and end in eternity.
What are you gonna do?
- You mean, Dr. Bryce, what's in my mind?
- Yeah.
What's in your mind?
Don't worry.
I don't want to hurt you.
- [Dripping]
- [Orchestra On Recording: Dirge]
[Orchestra Continues]
Turn that down, will you, Trevor?
[Volume Decreases]
Would you like a drink?
No.
I don't like to see you like this.
Get out — now.
Leave the company, Oliver.
We don't need Newton.
I feel sorry for him.
Sorry for him?
Why?
Because he can't help it.
[Moaning]
[Moaning Continues]
Well, you know Mary-Lou's still living in the house.
[Dog Howling In Distance]
I've seen her a few times.
How is she?
She knows, doesn't she?
Mmm.
[Sniffles]
I trust you both.
[Newton]
What's the time?
[Bryce]
It's late, past midnight.
[Newton]
Is time on my side?
- [Danfare]
- [Man #1] This is a unique moment... in the history of space exploration.
Never before has one man planned to travel single-handed to the stars.
[Man #2]
It isn't a question of one man, Alan.
Here we have the head of the World Enterprises
Corporation himself manning the spacecraft.
- [Alan] Yes, Peter.
- Here he comes.
This has given rise to widespread speculation about possible repercussions.
That is to say, if anything should happen to Mr. Newton —
And now, over to our economic adviser in Washington, D.C. —
[Mary-Lou]
I don't want the money. I want my Tommy.
- [Darnsworth] Here's the check, Mary-Lou.
- I don't want it.
[Sobbing]
No. No.
How do you feel about the progress they're making here?
Well, I think it's quite fantastic.
It's a breakthrough — a real breakthrough.
[Man]
There it is. He's coming now toward the gate.
He's coming, surrounded by his fellow men — his workers.
He seems to be in a jubilant state.
[Man #2] There's widespread feeling that
Mr. Newton's latest experiment is wasteful.
- This is the amount.
- [Screams] No! I don't want it!
[Man #2]... result in any special benefit to the nations of this Earth.
[Overlapping Voices]
I don't want it! I want Tommy.
[Sobbing]
[Woman]
I can see Commander—
- Good luck. I wish I could go with you.
- Thank you.
- [Chattering]
- [Overlapping Voices]
[Mary-Lou]
Tommy! Oh!
[Man]... Darnsworth as to the purpose ofMr. Newton's mission.
All that anyone has yet said about it — and that was said by Mr. Newton's associate,
Dr. Nathan Bryce, was that the mission —
I want Tommy.
I want him.
[All Chattering]
[Overlapping Voices]
[Man]
Are you confident that you'll be a success?
[Mary-Lou Sobbing]
[Man]... all seems to heighten the whole enigma ofMr. Newton himself.
This amazing man is not only the owner of World Enterprises Corporation... but he's also the inventor of its most exceptional products.
Where he comes from is as mysterious as where he's going.
- He's not in fact an American citizen —
- I've got an hour, Arthur.
Take me back to the house.
...but is the bearer of a British passport.
- [Sobbing]
- Thank you, Mary-Lou.
But from research done by my colleagues in the U.K., it's unclear...
- as to Mr. Newton's true background.
- I want Tommy. Tommy.
I hesitate to say that this is an important moment in the history of our country... but it is certainly an extraordinary one.
There's no parallel to be found with what this man has done and is now doing.
It's difficult to compare him with anyone.
He is unique.
We have all, strangely enough, relied on Mr. Newton, who is, after all —
- How many does she take?
- Thirty-five.
[Man On Radio]
They call him "The Killer from Panama."
Don't bother.
Oh.
Duran, trying to work around, makes a right hand and staggers the Mexican out —
Arthur.
Arthur, can you hear me?
[Zipper Opening]
[Buzzing]
- Arthur!
- I haven't got the time now.
[Buzzer Buzzing]
Hello, Mr. Farnsworth.
Well, I knew it had to come.
It had to come, didn't it?
- [Grunting]
- What are you doing?
What? Don't take my —
Those are my eyes!
Don't take my —
[All Grunting]
Wait a minute now. Wait.
People will know! They'll talk!
- Get —
- [Yelling]
Let me see you!
[Phone Ringing]
[Grunts]
Stop a minute.
- [Groaning]
- [Ringing Continues]
- There you go.
- No... more.
More.
I won't believe it.
- Listen, I haven't got —
- Give me his other arm.
I haven't got the time.
W-Wait.
Let's —
It's not that different.
Won't you let me see your face?
Goddamn it.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
[Man On Radio] Two left hooks and a short right buys a run on the champion.
With the body.
Look at that hook.
Out with his right hand.
I've changed my mind.
There's nothing to worry about.
I know who you are!
[Groans]
[Gasping]
Where are you taking me?
[Breathing Heavily]
[Heartbeats Thumping]
Now we're gonna put you guys to bed.
Here we go, big guy.
Oh. You got a kiss for your dad? Huh?
Okay.
I wonder if we do and say the right things.
To the children?
No. Everything.
[Interviewer] He hasjust been appointed special adviser to the new administration... on matters ofeconomic development in the chemical industry.
Professor Canutti, are there any major new developments... that have taken place recently, Professor?
Well, as we all know, a giant corporation, which had become...
- Good morning, Mr. Newton.
- A household word in this country...
- Good morning, Albert.
- Ran into financial difficulties.
- The main reason for this was the corporation...
- I feel so tired.
- How about a nice, refreshing martini?
- Relied heavily on... that two-headed monster: Innovation.
Now, the American consumer can assimilate...
- only so many new products in a given period of time...
- Just the way you like it.
- Not too cold.
- And then no more.
There. Now, it's a beautiful day.
Oh.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
Thank you, Arthur.
You know, if all of you drank less, we'd get better results.
Take my advice and stick to mineral water.
Keep your perspective.
I'll talk to him.
I know he'll be all right.
I'm not sure. We've got a serious unemployment problem on our hands now.
The media... are beginning to hint at a... fraud.
People need reassuring... and they've got a right to the facts.
- I understand, Mr. Peters.
- Well, I'm not quite sure... you understand... how all this might affect you.
[Metal Clinking]
- Nate. Help me, Nate.
- Don't worry, Mr. Newton. You're perfectly normal.
[Sighing, Murmuring]
[Newton]
Help me, Nate.
[Bryce]
I do. That's a fact. That's a fact.
- It's been such a long time, Nate.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you really think I look nice?
It's really good to get out, you know.
Mmm. Have you seen him?
No, I, uh —
They're keeping us away from him.
You have seen Calloway.
What are you two doing?
Well, they — they asked me to help take him.
I'm helping.
[Zither]
Poor Harry.
"Poor Harry."
"Poor Harry" wouldn't even lift a finger to help you.
Poor Tommy. We haven't helped him much, have we?
I think maybe we have a chance now. They —
They might let you, uh, see him.
Alone that is.
I don't want him anymore.
I don't want to see him, hear him, but he's still a part of me. That's a fact.
I don't want to hurt him anymore.
Poor Tommy's been hurt enough.
I know, but, uh, well, I might be able to arrange for you to talk to him.
Maybe you, uh — you can save him.
Save him?
From what?
[Train Whistle Blows On TV]
Good evening, Mr. Newton.
Would you take off your pajama jacket, please?
- How long will I have to stay in this place?
- I have no idea.
It probably depends on why you're here.
[Zither Continues On TV]
- [Man On TV] Oh, Anna, why do we always —
- I'm a surgeon.
- This is just a little test.
- Have to quarrel?
- [Anna] If you want to sell your services —
- Would you drop your trousers?
I've told you everything.
- I loved him. You loved him.
- You're just gonna hurt me again.
- This won't hurt. Trust me. Hmm?
- What good have we done him? Love.
[Doctor]
Nurse.
Okay, Mr. Newton.
Point your toes in, please.
Okay. Take a nice, deep breath now.
Okay, hold it.
- [Grunts]
- That's fine.
I told you before.
I came alone.
I came alone.
Nobody saw me.
[Zither Continues]
Oh, Tommy.
My sweet baby.
Oh, I never thought
I'd see you again.
Oh, you look so beautiful to my eyes.
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
Oh.
- Do they know?
- Know what?
About you.
How did you get in here?
Through the front doors.
The double doors?
Where are you —
Where are you going?
[Grunting]
[Whimpers]
You never get sick.
What happens to you when you drink?
I see things.
What things?
Bodies.
Bodies? Women?
- And men.
- Men!
Men?
[Laughs]
Mmm! Mmm! Bad boy!
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
I want it.
I've been dreaming of it.
Please.
Do you know what I think?
What?
I think you know —
You know too much about me.
What do you mean?
I can do anything... now, you know.
I can kill you... right here on this bed.
- [Murmurs]
- Then I could...
- phone room service.
- [Murmuring]
And they'd — they'd take your body away... and then I'd have them send up another girl.
Oh, Tommy. Tommy.
I just want it to be like it was.
Me, the two of us.
You. You.
The way you were.
That's the way I am!
It's too late, Mary-Lou.
I can't trust you.
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
- Good-bye, Mary-Lou.
- No.
- Sleep well!
- No! No! [Screaming]
[Sobbing]
- [Yelps]
- [Rock]
- [Laughing]
- Hello, Mary-Lou
- Won't they come in? The noise!
- Good-bye, heart
Sweet Mary-Lou
I'm so in love with you
No. They gave me the gun and the blanks. I asked for them.
- And I asked for you, and here you are.
- Oh. Ooh.
- Good-bye, heart
- [Moaning, Murmuring]
- You passed by one sunny day
- Please. Please.
- Flashed those big brown eyes my way
- Yeah.
- How I wanted you
- [Gunshot]
- Forevermore
- [Moaning]
[Laughing]
Bite it.
Why are they doing that, giving you everything?
- [Laughing]
- Though I never did meet you before
- I say hello, Mary-Lou
- They're not really giving me anything.
- I'm paying. I'm —
- Good-bye, heart
- I'm rich.
- Yeah.
- I'm so in love with you
- I can afford anything.
- I knew, Mary-Lou
- [Gunshot]
- We'd never part
- You like that?
So, hello, Mary-Lou
- Push.
- Let me get up. Let me get up.
- [Laughing]
- [Gunshot]
[Both Moaning, Grunting]
[Laughing]
Here, you shoot. You shoot.
- Yes, higher. Come up here.
- I like that.
Oh!
- Yes.
- Oh, please. [Laughs]
Oh, please,
O noble sire.
- Hello, Mary-Lou
- Oh, that's awful.
Good-bye, heart
Sweet Mary-Lou
I'm so in love with you
- [Newton] Yes. Yes.
- Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
[Mary-Lou]
Oh, don't you — [Laughs]
- [Laughing]
- So, hello, Mary-Lou
- Oh. Ahhh.
- [Gunshot]
- Yes.
- Mmm.
Say your prayers, boy.
[Gunshot]
Give me a kiss.
Mmm. Mmm.
[Makes Kissing Sounds]
[Table Tennis Ball Bouncing]
[Mary-Lou]
You don't want to go back. Not really.
You've got everything here.
Tell me one thing that you have on your planet —
Whoo! — that we don't have on ours.
Come on. Tell me one thing.
You don't have any money.
You don't have any water.
You don't have any grass.
You don't have any booze.
Mmm.
What do you want to go back to a desert for?
If you want desert, we got deserts here.
This country's rich.
We got everything.
All right.
I know.
Your wife and your family.
But by the time you get back, they'll probably be dead.
I mean, how long is it gonna take you to get back from here, Tommy?
How many years?
Light-years, or whatever you want to call 'em.
How many?
All I'm trying to say,
Tommy, is that... if you could just prove who you really are, you'd be free!
Don't you understand?
They don't understand you.
They don't believe you.
Believe me.
They think you're one of us.
They think you're a freak or a fake.
I know you're not.
All you have to do is just prove it to 'em.
Let 'em see you as you really are.
Listen.
Nate could probably make a deal for you.
I'll bet you you could probably go back.
They'd probably let you go back.
I'm sure they would!
You could get into that little rocket ship of yours and go back!
Huh?
No.
- What do you mean, no?
- No.
Come on, Tommy.
Show 'em.
Prove it to them.
Come on.
- Prove it.
- No, I don't want to. I've proved enough.
I've proved everything I'm gonna prove.
I've gone as far as I'm going.
I don't love you anymore.
And I don't love you.
You're gonna die like an animal.
Just an animal, a stupid creature.
I want to give you something.
Here you are.
It's my last present.
It's the only thing that's really mine to give.
I don't want it.
Why not?
It doesn't fit, Tommy.
It doesn't fit!
It doesn't fit!
[Crying]
[Crying]
Now we're going to take some photographs of you.
- That's all right, Nurse.
- Very straightforward.
The first picture will be a routine photo of your retinas.
- That's for a simple identification of your blood vessel pattern.
- What are you doing?
And the other is an equally straightforward X-ray.
That's so we can see the ridges on the inside of your occipita —
- You don't understand. The flash of an X-ray —
- Nurse, will you please —
- [Doctor #1] This won't hurt at all. I assure you.
- There's no flash with an X-ray.
- You can't see an X-ray.
- I can.
- I can see X-rays.
- Here, drink this.
[Doctor #1] I can see something.
Are you wearing contact lenses?
- I can see something inside there.
- Please don't hurt my eyes.
Tweezers, please.
No, you won't be able to take them out.
I've been dealing with lenses for 20 years. It won't hurt.
I'll do it.
Don't touch my eyes.
Give me the tweezers, please.
- Hand me the tweezers.
- No, I can't let you do it. I can't.
Give Mr. Newton another drink.
Please don't do it.
Please. I beg you.
- Please don't be excited.
- Call Dr. Bryce. He knows.
- Call him.
- I don't know who Dr. Bryce is.
- I want to go home.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- I want to go home.
- Very soon now.
- Finish your drink.
- Please don't do it. You don't understand.
- All right, Doctor. When you're ready.
- Mary-Lou!
- I'm ready.
- Help me! Don't!
No. No!
[Newton]
They're stuck. They're stuck.
I'll never get them off.

So on and on
I'd like to go someplace for Christmas where it's real hot.

- True love
- True love

- Have a guardian angel

And to give to me
Love
Forever true
[Woman On Speakers]
I think that love is comin' back
I think romance is on the rise
And all across the world
All the boys and girls are making eyes
Could I listen to a track off this?
Yeah. Let me see.
Yeah, sure.
Come this way.
[Coughs]
[Continues, Indistinct]
[Man]
There you are.
Thank you.
Mr. Newton?
- Nathan Bryce.
- That's right.
May I sit down?
Hmm? Go ahead.
Strangely enough,
I was thinking of you just the other day.
[Helicopter Whirring]
[Big BandJazz On Speakers]
[Newton]
How did you find me?
Your record.
- Hmm?
- It took me a while, but I traced you.
- Did you like it?
- Not much.
Oh. Well, I didn't make it for you anyway.
Who'd you make it for then?
For my wife.
She'll get to hear it one day... on the radio.
We hear most everything on the radio these days.
Do you see anything of Mary-Lou?
Not much.
[Big Band Jazz Continues]
I don't want her to get lonely.
She must still have enough money.
Don't you feel bitter about it — everything?
Bitter? No.
We'd have probably treated you the same if you'd come over to our place.
Is there no chance then?
Of what?
Of course there's a chance.
You're the scientist, Dr. Bryce.
You must know there's always a chance.
Do you need money?
Let me know if you do, will you?
I may not see so well anymore —
Still have money.
- [Glass Clinks On Ground]
- Oh!
Ah.
I think maybe Mr. Newton has had enough, don't you?
I think maybe he has.
Ah.
[Big BandJazz Swells, Continues]
[Fades]
- Oh.
- Careful, Doc.
- Easy.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.
All right.
- Christ, he's heavy.
- Yes, he is.
Doesn't sound like he wants to leave you, Doc.
I'm sure you'll give it a good home.
Oh, yeah.
He'll have it real easy.
He'll just lie around all day, you know.
He'll travel a little, get to meet a lot of interesting people.
I kind of envy 'em sometimes.
I really do.
Shut up in there!
You got to learn some manners, before you and me are gonna get along.
- That right, Doc?
- It'll settle down in time.
What time is it?
Well, it looks like day is about to pop in.
I'd say about 4:30.
There you are, Doc.
That's 800 bucks.
Thank you.
- Aren't you gonna count that?
- I trust you.
Boy. Ain't many people ever said that to me before, Doc.
You're a real gentleman, you know that?
And a genius, besides.
Yes, sir. You're a real and a bona fide genius.
First one I ever met.
It's rare to be appreciated for one's failures.
You mark my words, Doc.
You're gonna go down in history as a great man.
You're great man, Doc.
I'm gonna get this show on the road.
- See ya.
- Good-bye.
Here we have two of the most commonly confused snakes.
Uh, that is, the snakes themselves are not confused, but we have a tendency to confuse them.
Let me put that another way.
The difference is, in the case of the poisonous coral, the red and yellow bands touch.
Whereas, in the case of the non-poisonous king, the red and yellow bands are separated by black stripes.
Now, a good way to remember that is the old folk saying:
"Red touch yellow, kill a fellow."
I Laughing 1
And they're off...
Uh, with the exception of Miss Stewart.
Dr. Daniels,
I didn't want you to think...
Oh, but thinking comes naturally to me, Kitty.
Just as, uh, apparently...
Red touch yellow, kill a what?
Kenneth Daniels, I'm confused.
Miss Stewart, you'll have to excuse us, unless, of course, you have a good stomach for bloodletting.
Pretty girl.
Still up to your old vices.
Shame on you.
- Here.
- No, thank you.
Oh, you might as well.
Neither one of us have very long to live, anyway.
You might as well enjoy yourself.
That's been your attitude for 20 years.
Ahhh.
Now we'll hear about the carefree grasshopper and the busy ant.
No. Not my field.
Oh, that's right. You're our ophiological expert, aren't you?
The esteemed Dr. Stoner in his country laboratory... cackling over his bubbling bottles and dripping serum.
The theories I have originated are now being considered by the world medical opinion.
Considered inconclusive.
Now, let's get to the point.
Since I'm chairman of the department, you'd like me to recommend an extension of your research grant for another year.
- Isn't that it?
- Look, Ken.
I am not some crackpot who's come in begging, hat in hand.
I've got 30 years in the field of venom research.
I've got 7 books, 63 articles, and monographs.
Please, don't haul out those thumb-worn and yellowed credentials.
Please.
Oh, I feel sorry for you, Carl.
A first-rate mind... gone to seed.
Well... Well, I suppose I have been a little bit out of it, lately.
As you've said, we haven't got that long to live.
Of course, I need that grant.
I was hoping you might recommend some bright young student who'd be willing to help me this summer.
I thought you had someone working for you.
I did have, but he left me on short notice.
I'm not exactly sure I want to place one of my students in your hands.
Oh, come on, Ken.
You've ridden my ass enough today.
I may be a little self-involved, but I'm hardly Dr. Frankenstein.
You are to me.
You've been a thorn in my side for 20 years.
- I'm sorry, Ken.
- It's not Ken.
It's Dr. Daniels, Dr. Stoner.
We can't be friends.
At least, we ought to treat each other with proper accord.
- Agreed.
- Say it... "Dr. Daniels."
Dr. Daniels.
Well...
It's about time I had a little respect from you, eh?
You have it... and my gratitude, if you'll just recommend somebody to help me.
Well, I suppose I could find it in the goodness of my heart.
As a matter of fact,
I think I know just the boy.
You got Kitty in trouble.
I don't like that.
Oh, come on, Steve.
You know he didn't mean to.
If anybody gets a chick in trouble, it's old Steve-O.
Are you going to apologize to her or am I gonna have to make you do it?
I don't think there's anything to apologize for.
- This says different.
- What's that, proof of Darwin's theory?
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means natural selection.
Survival of the fittest.
- Are you David?
- Uh, yes.
- David Blake?
- Yes.
- I'm Dr. Stoner.
- The herpetologist?
The herpetologist, yes.
I'm into snakes.
Uh, David. Excuse us.
Lucky.
I know the snake...
I can't believe that Dr. Daniels really recommended me for this job.
Why do you say that?
Well, he's just not my idea of a real teacher.
Every time I ask him a question, he just says,
"Why don't you work on that little problem for yourself, and please spare me the results of your efforts."
That sounds like Daniels.
In the future, let's try to respect each other's questions, see what happens.
Incidentally, I don't think wisdom will die with Dr. Daniels.
Oh. It's all right, Harry.
This is Harry, my obedient serpent.
Hello, Harry.
Wow. He's a real beauty, isn't he?
- Red-tailed boa?
- Yes.
Wow. He's hot.
Hey, you're thirsty, aren't you, boy?
Oh. I've got a little something here for Harry.
Here you g0, BOY-
Can't deny an old man his nip now and then.
After all, in human terms,
Harry's almost 63.
I'll just get some water for Harry.
Hey. What gives, kid?
Ah, just helpin' you out.
Helping yourself, you mean?
Now, I am sorry about that, but maybe that'll teach you to ask before you touch.
[ Chuckling 1
Holy shit! Help!
- It's all right. Don't panic. Don't panic.
- Get it off!
- Just get it off!
- Relax your arm, please.
- Well, just get it off of me.
- I will.
David, could you give me a hand, please?
It's his tail that's caught so tight.
Let go, Harry. Let go.
What's the matter with you people, anyway?
You crazy or somethin'? Carryin' a snake around like that in a car!
Sorry, but that'll teach you to ask before you touch.
David, we're home.
Hi, Dad.
I wasn't expecting you back until tomorrow.
Oh, a friend of mine gave me a ride, so I decided to save time and money.
You know, you would be amazed at how much work babies are, even your sister's.
I missed you.
Grandpa!
Oh. Hello, Jeffrey.
Oh, excuse me.
Uh, this is my daughter...
Kristina.
- Kristina, this is David Blake.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- David's going to be my new assistant.
- Where's Tim?
- Tim left.
He left? Just like that?
Illness in the family.
His father was seriously ill.
He's a handsome fellow.
You know, I thought he told me his father was dead.
His fath... You're right.
It was Tim's uncle.
It's a shame.
The fear that most people have of snakes is based on the same misunderstanding that they have about any other minority group.
If they're told that one member is harmful, then they generalize and believe that they're all dangerous.
It's so stupid.
For example, uh, the hognose is completely harmless.
So much so that he can't even be induced to bite.
Watch me. Watch my finger.
See him get away?
See? See him run away from my finger?
Put your finger in there.
Go ahead.
Right up to his nose.
He's a consummate coward.
[ Chuckling 1
That's enough.
Let's leave him alone.
[ Bubbling 1
Uh, this is Sam.
It's Kristina's turtle.
He's... albino from Malaysia.
He's a little peculiar.
You've, uh, probably noticed, David, all the tags in this laboratory.
The color of the tag indicates the comparative degree of danger of the species.
Now, a green tag means non-poisonous.
A yellow tag means poisonous.
But, uh, serum for all of these snakes along the wall here is easily obtained.
Now, a red tag means highly venomous.
Uh, serum is available for these species, but in most cases, it arrives too late for help.
The, uh, black mamba, for example...
That's him in the cup.
...secretes enough poison in a single bite to kill 10 men.
- Oh? Where does he come from?
- Africa.
This one was from the Congo.
I see by the chart he's hungry, or at least he ought to be. Uh...
- Would you, uh, stand back, please?
- Oh.
He may appear to be a little shy at first.
But...
...he's the fastest snake in the world.
But I have him... near the head, too, where I need him.
His, uh, venom is neurotoxic, inhibiting the breathing and affecting the vagus nerve that controls the heartbeat.
The victim's heart beats wildly, and he usually succumbs within an hour to symptoms that appear very much like a heart attack.
Would you hand me that feeding gun, please?
You know, uh, most snakes will not eat in captivity.
This, uh, force-feeder contains a premeasured diet of, uh, milk, eggs, vitamin concentrates, liver, gelatin, bone meal and chicken blood.
- Chicken blood?
- For flavor.
Give it a little squeeze, please.
Gently.
That's it. Now, we don't want to give him indigestion. That's enough.
David, together, we've just fed a very hungry black mamba.
Excuse me.
This room here is where we store venom... and dry-freeze it into crystals...
...just like coffee.
Then it's blended and ground and, uh, shipped to pharmaceutical firms and research laboratories... where it's used as, uh, coagulants and, uh, pain relievers... and the treatment of certain blood diseases.
Bookkeeping.
When I have the time, all of this, which I detest so much...
You do all this by yourself?
No. Kristina helps me with the feeding and the paper work.
And, of course, she runs the show on Sunday.
It's basically a family business.
Well, Dr. Stoner, if there's anything I can do to help...
I just hope you're not afraid of needles.
Immunization is an occupational necessity in our house.
That hurts more than the bite of most snakes.
What is it, some kind of antibiotic?
Not precisely.
You can put your finger on that for a few minutes.
- It sure does sting.
- That'll only last a few minutes.
And you won't even feel that during the booster shots.
Booster shots?
Every few days for the next month or so, until you can sustain a full drop of raw venom.
Oh. Wait a minute.
What are you trying to do, kill me?
On the contrary.
I'm trying to make sure that nothing else does.
Come here, David.
The king cobra... the most dangerous of all living creatures.
It's six years, and he still doesn't like me.
Why should he?
I'm just a common human and...
...he's the king.
The most cunning, the most vicious, the most insolent of all God's creatures.
It's only Friday, Your Majesty.
Two more days you'll get your chance again.
He's not afraid of anything, is he?
Nothing human.
Do you recognize the common mongoose?
Harmless, furry little animal... except when he faces a cobra.
Are you religious, David?
Well, I've... I've never really given it much thought.
I've given it a great deal of thought.
You've read, of course, that the serpent who tempted Eve was actually...
Oh, come on, Dad! David doesn't want to hear about all that right now.
Kristina, I'm not going to bore him with the whole Book of Genesis.
The serpent who tempted Eve in the garden was actually Lucifer, the Devil, cast down on Earth in another form to do the Lord God's work.
Dr. Stoner, do you really think it was God's work?
To tempt man with the fruit of knowledge?
What else would you call it?
Granted, we have misused that knowledge and brought man to the brink of extinction.
Well, I don't think man will ever become extinct.
I think he has the will and the knowledge to find some way to survive.
Do you really? So do I.
To evolve, in order to survive.
And I think we can help him.
I don't know if I'll be much help to man tonight.
Well, forget man.
What about woman?
Who's gonna help me wash the dishes?
I will.
Oh.
I feel so... sleepy. I...
It's the effect of the inoculation.
You'll sleep very soundly tonight,
David... and, perhaps, even through tomorrow.
And if you're lucky, you may experience what few persons have ever known and lived to recall.
You see, the venom of the cobra is one of nature's strongest hallucinogens.
Kristina. Kristina.
We'd better help this boy to his room.
You're asking me questions, Harry, and I hear you.
But a scientist cannot afford the indulgence of guilt.
And after all, if God doesn't want me to continue, the means of my disposal... always at his command.
- A little more?
- Come on.
You're gonna turn him into an alcoholic.
Here, drink the juice.
- Thank you.
- Harry, don't listen to him.
He's past it, isn't he?
He's going to be fine.
Please, uh, don't crowd up to the enclosure.
There's plenty of room for everyone to see.
You can sit on your cars, or you can sit on your neighbor's cars, but please do not crowd up to the enclosure.
Back off.
Would you back off.
Just about around in here is fine.
Children, back off over in there.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness one of the most dangerous demonstrations in the history of modern science.
Dr. Carl Stoner, my father, will capture and extract venom from one of the deadliest creatures on Earth... the king cobra.
Although many snake venoms are considered more toxic or poisonous, the king cobra has enough venom in a single bite to kill 30 men.
And unlike most snakes that attack and then retreat, the king cobra is apt to chew into his victim several times.
However, being of royal heritage, the king will never attack unless annoyed.
Unfortunately, almost everything annoys the king.
Sounds like my wife.
Complete silence, please, and no pictures until I give the signal.
Ladies and gentlemen, one of the world's greatest scientists... and... and experts in the field of herpetology,
Dr. Carl Stoner.
Now, if you would please form a circle around the enclosure, but please stand back about two or three feet.
And remember what I said about not taking any pictures.
Ladies and gentlemen, the king cobra!
I wouldn't touch it.
Watch out!
Dr. Stoner is now extracting the venom from the king cobra.
In the extraction process, the snake secretes its venom voluntarily.
And by this method, a snake can be kept healthy and producing venom for many years.
Now I'm helping Dr. Stoner feed the snake using a pressure gun, which delivers a completely balanced combination of nutrients.
For those of you who are now leaving, may I remind you that contributions will help Dr. Stoner continue his research.
We really appreciate your support.
Only $18.15.
It's better than last week.
$18 to risk your life?
What's the matter with those people?
Don't they realize the importance of what he's doing?
They come for the show.
Some of them come hoping he'll get bitten.
Has he ever been bitten?
More times than I care to remember.
I'm glad the immunization really works.
With the smaller snakes, yeah, but nobody knows about the king.
Damn!
Now, I've got you.
He got me, Harry.
I'll milk you tomorrow.
You African bastard!
I've got enough serum in me for 10 mamba bites.
We're both getting older and slower, Harry.
I think that's a sign that...
I should stop dueling with the king.
Too many important things to think about.
You know, I saw an intriguing article yesterday.
At our present rate of consumption, we can expect worldwide fuel shortages in less than 50 years.
The world is gonna belong to the cold-blooded species.
But we already knew that, didn't we, Har?
It's a perfectly natural reaction to the cobra inoculation.
I just wish you'd told me about it before.
I feel like an orange.
Yes. You see, the venom burns off the superficial layers of the skin... much like a sunburn, only from the inside.
It's the same principle that allows a cobra to shed his skin every few months.
Don't tell me this is gonna happen every few months...
'cause, if it is, you should've got a fatter assistant.
This is the first and last time.
I feel positively naked... and cold.
- Good.
- What?
You'd best put on a sweater.
I feel a little chilly in here, myself.
Doc Stoner.
I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Dale Hardison.
I'm an old student of yours.
Yes. I think I do recall.
Well, there's no reason why you should.
I never was too good a student.
But, uh, well, I'm the one that never could remember the name of those plants' phylums.
"Phyla"... still the plural.
But, uh, you seem to have found a worthwhile calling preserving the status quo.
Well, yeah, it, uh, takes all kinds.
- This is my deputy, Morgan Bock.
- How do you do?
But not spelled the same as the composer.
What, uh, what can I do for you, gentlemen?
Well, you could get us a couple of girls.
We were kinda hopin', Doc, that you could give us the 25-cent tour of your place.
We've heard a lot about it up in town.
Be a pleasure. This way.
Come ahead, Mr. Bock.
This is the laboratory.
And this...
...is my daughter, Kristina.
Ma'am.
And a female python.
A couple of girls.
Don't tell me my old parking tickets have caught up on me.
Well, if they have, looks like you've got a pretty good lawyer to defend you.
No. No, she's sick.
Poor thing, she won't eat.
That's three and a half weeks.
I think we should isolate her, so she doesn't infect the others.
Gentlemen, she's heavy.
Could you give me a hand?
Geez, Doc. Is it...? Is it safe?
Pythons rarely attack except when they're hungry or if they sense great fear.
- All right.
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on, Morg.
- It's okay. Just go right behind me.
I've got its head.
It's all right.
Whoa!
It's okay. I've got its head.
- About four feet behind her.
- Yeah, right behind me.
- Oh, right about there.
- It's okay. Just grab on right there.
Yes.
- Right here?
- That's a good spot.
Let's lift.
One, two, three, up.
- Come on, Morgan.
- Whoa.
- Okay? Got it?
- On the way to the storm cellar.
That's the isolation spot.
Oh?
Easy. Easy.
I appreciate this so much.
Are you doing all right there?
Doing okay, I guess.
Sure is a big snake.
I know.
Gently. Thank you.
Dad, I left some cages open.
I better go lock them up.
Thank you, Kristina.
Damn it.
That virus is hanging on.
You and, uh, your daughter live here alone, Doc?
Yes. And my assistant, David Blake.
Possibly you saw him as you drove up.
Hmm. You've got another boy working here for you, don't you?
- Tim McGraw?
- He left some time ago.
Hmm. Went back to school, huh?
No. I think a relative was ill.
That, uh... That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Doc.
Uh, I got a letter from his aunt.
She hasn't heard from him for a couple of months and... she's kinda worried.
I went over to the school to check out the records and... nobody over there seen or heard from him since he came to work for you.
These kids today just pick up and take off.
Some of them do.
You, uh...
You just gonna leave that snake runnin' around down here, loose?
The cellar door is secure enough.
And she'll probably nest up there in the roofs.
Well, Morg,
I guess we better be goin'.
Uh-huh.
- Thank you, Doc.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- What do you call him?
- His name's Aaron.
- And what do you call him?
- Aaron the II.
It's not infrequent that they're born with two heads, it's just that only about one in a million survive.
Huh.
So that's what a baby cobra looks like.
Mm-hmm.
Careful. Careful.
They already have fangs and venom.
You know, they're the only creatures that can protect themselves from the moment of birth.
Father says it's because they're God's favorites.
See? Look.
- Bye-bye, Dad!
- Bye!
- I'd like 'I20 insure it 1:00, for $3,000.
You people sure got the racket.
All you do is give them snakes a little squeeze and... the money comes pouring out.
You know, if we could just get an urutu, we could actually start to make real profits.
The urutu is one of the rarest snakes in the world... and is found only in the jungles of the Amazon.
- Hey. Where does that go?
- Oh, it goes around the lake.
You know that one drop of urutu venom...
What are you doing?
Uh, hey, uh, let's go for a swim.
Don't be silly.
We didn't bring our suits.
It doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother you.
Come on.
Come on, Kris.
Look, you're a naturalist, right?
Well, what could be more natural than the two of us... going for a swim in the lake?
Come on.
Ready?
I'll go first.
You're cumin'?
Hurry UP!
Don't look!
Why?
You're going to be looking.
Look, that's the problem!
I can't see without my glasses!
So you can't look, either!
Okay, okay, I won't look!
Hurry up!
- Promise?
- Promise!
Whoa!
Wow, is it warm!
- Cover your eyes!
- Kristina, get in the water!
David, cover your eyes!
All right, all right!
Come on.
It's not getting any warmer.
I'm coming.
Hey! You're peeking.
No. I'm not.
Come on. Cover your eyes.
Hurry up. Oh, it's nice.
Ugh. It's freezing!
- No, it's warm.
- It's freez... You lied!
Watch out.
- Hug me.
- No touching.
That's not fair.
[ Gigqlinq 1
No. No.
The skin shedding is complete...
on schedule and no complications.
David's body temperature is dropping at the rate of three degrees a day.
Should stabilize at 80 degrees by the end of the week.
The prognosis is perfect.
Slight flattening of the nostrils.
Eyelids beginning to recede.
Facets that will not be readily apparent for several days.
After that, however, the evolutionary process should accelerate greatly.
Cataclysmic changes should occur...
Oh.
I have you.
And I set you free.
Oh.
- You know something?
- What?
I think your father's actually worried
I might try something with you.
Well, aren't you going to?
Of course not.
Not while you're driving, doctor.
Look! A carnival!
[ Clown laughing 1
Ohhh! Whoa!
Ohhh! Geez!
You look terrible! Aah!
Look at it!
It's the High-boy!
High-low fast and safe!
Sensational ride!
Okay, we got a winner!
All right. Here it goes, guys!
All right! All right!
I don't know, Morgan.
Maybe you should've gone into some other kind of work.
Here, Daniel Boone.
You try it. Go ahead.
- You payin'?
- I'll pay,
- Feel a lot safer now, Morgan?
- Oh, yeah.
If you live to be 1,000, you may never again get the chance to see the most fantastic, the most bizarre, the most incredible creatures in all of creation!
25 cents is all it costs.
One thin quarter.
Two dimes and a nickle.
Three nickles and a dime.
Anyway you add it up, it's the greatest bargain in the whole world.
Sam Lee, the seal boy.
Arvin Le Deux, the man with two noses.
Joan and John Prendergast, brother and sister Siamese twins, joined together forever at the waist.
And the incredible snake man!
Half-man, half-snake.
The most astonishing human reptile in the history of the world.
Let's go see.
I can't stand those things.
You know they're all fake.
Fake? Did I hear the little lady say "fake"?
Ladies and gentlemen, and gentlemen and ladies, listen to me and listen well.
$1,000. That's right.
A crisp, new $1,000 bill.
This is my gift to the person who can prove that the snakeman is not real.
That's right. You heard me correctly.
He's inside now, waiting for you.
No glass surrounds him.
No mirrors distort him.
You may see him, speak to him, touch him, if you dare.
And the person that proves that the incredible snakeman is not real, alive and as presented, will receive $1,000 in cash.
What do you say, sonny? The little lady says the thing is a fake...
Come on.
Let's go see it.
All it costs is one thin quarter to prove she's right and collect yourself $1,000 in change.
- Come on. Let's go check it out.
- No. No. You go.
$1,000 just to prove the snakeman is a fake.
I'll wait right here.
You go see.
Real as life. One look.
Don't touch, just look.
Here it is, ladies and gentlemen,
As real as you've ever seen it before in your whole life.
Hey, baby.
This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
And in appreciation,
I'll even let you buy me a beer.
Oh, no. Really.
I'm waiting for someone.
Who could be more important?
Kristina, you've gotta see it.
It's incredible. It's got blue eyes.
Hello, little David.
How you doing tonight?
Hi, Steve. How are you?
Yeah, good to see you.
Real good to see you.
What are you...?
What is this?
- What the hell is going...?
- What are you doing?
Oh, don't hurt him, Steve.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off...
David, no!
All right, all right. All right, what do you think this is, an arena?
Okay.
Ow! Come on!
Hey, cut it out!
Break it up. You're ruining business for the paying shows.
Son of a bitch bit me!
Hey, buddy, you wanna go to jail?
Randall, why don't you stick to football?
Now where'd you come from?
- He's Dr. Stoner's assistant.
- Oh, yeah. Miss Stoner.
You're Dr. Stoner's daughter.
That crazy...
He's not crazy, you goddamn Neanderthal!
Neanderthal?
I don't like the sound of that!
All right. This is gettin' a little wearisome for everybody.
Come on, you two.
Let's go.

Goddamn it. I said, move.
- Let's get out of here.
- Come on, Steve.
Night, sheriff!
"I think I could turn and live with animals.
They are so placid and self-contained.
I stand and look at them long and long.
They do not sweat and whine about their condition.
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.
They do not make me sick, discussing their duty to God.
Not one is dissatisfied.
Not one is demented with the mania of owning things.
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago.
Not one is respectable... or unhappy over the whole Earth."

Huh. The lovers return.
Look sober now, Harry, or Kristine will make us blow in a balloon.
- Okay.
- It's all set. She'll do it for 10 bucks.
10 bucks each or 10 bucks for all of us?
10 bucks each. What do you think, she's some cheap hooker?
I don't have to pay for it.
Never did. Never will.
Hey, didn't you tell the guy who Steve is?
Yeah. I was afraid then she'd ask for 20.
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?
You wanna go outside and mix it up?
No. Steve, no. Come on.
What's the matter with you?
He's still steamed about getting shot down by the redhead.
She dug me.
Sure. She just didn't see your clippings, that's all.
You'd better believe it.
- Goddamn.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going, Steve?
- Let the jerk go.
- He's nuts.
Come on, Harry.
Come on.
Come on. Drink it, Harry.
It'll make you feel better.
Go on.
That's a boy.
Dr. Stoner, why am I losing weight?
I expected it.
God. Feels like 40 below in here.
Harry, you know, you're getting lazy in your old age.
You gotta keep physically fit if you wanna make it in this world, Harry.
Good night, Harry.
- Hi, pretty baby.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Get out! Get out!
No! Get out!
Harry, no!
Get off! Get off!
Oh, no.
You people are nuts!
All of you!
- Keeping snakes around like that!
- Harry! Harry!
Oh, no!

Oh, no.
Do you know that boy's name?
"I think I could turn and live with animals.
They are so placid and self-contained.

Harry was just a snake, Kris.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
Look.
We'll try and find another Harry.

- What about it?
- I don't know. It looks different.

Come in.
Oh, Kristine.
- You're back early.
- Yes.
Maybe not early enough.
You and David seem to be getting along well together.
- We like each other.
- Yes.
Maybe we have different definitions of "like".
You're an innocent girl, Kristine.
You've had a very sheltered life, and I can understand how lonely...
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Don't you think it's a little late to be telling me about the birds and the bees?
- I'm very serious, Kristina.
- Well, what do you want me to say?
That you haven't slept with him.
I don't think that's any of your business.
You don't understand the consequences of what you're doing.
Oh, come on, Dad.
I mean, I may not be very sophisticated, but I do think I know a little...
No, you don't.
Kristina, one drop of...
David's blood could...
- Could what?
- Have an effect.
The inoculations.
There's a period in which the venom could have a damaging effect on his nervous system.
Want you to promise me you won't have intercourse with him.
I don't think you have the right to ask me that.
I have more than a right.
You are a stupid little child.
You don't understand what's happening.
And you're a stuffy, selfish, overprotective old man, and you could care less about me or my happiness!
- Kristina, I want your promise!
- No!

- What is it, Kristine?
- I wanna see David right now.
Well, he doesn't want to see you.
He's had an allergic reaction...
- Look, I don't...
- ...to the immunization.
His face is broken out.
You're hiding something from me.
I know it. He's gonna die, isn't he?
- He's not going to die. David!
- Yes?

- Ugly.

- Of course. Now, Kristine.
I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Kristina, drive carefully.
I can't believe you're really letting me do this all by myself.
- It's only a snake.
- Only a snake?
It's an urutu.
I wouldn't trust anybody else to pick it up.
- I'm sorry about last night.
- So am I.
Everybody forgiven?
- I'll call you tonight.
- Please do.
- Take care of him.
- I will.

I feel... I feel terrible.
David, drink this.
- What is it?
- A mild sedative.
- No, I don't feel...
- It'll calm you.
Doctor, what's happening to me?
You're gonna be all right, David.
[ II Whimpers ]
You've just become hypersensitive to the venom.
Yeah, well, don't...
Don't you think I should check into a hospital or something?
You may if you like.
But I'm not sure how much they know about cobra venom infections.
What is it?
My stomach.
[ Whimpering 1
It... It feels like my insides are being twisted.
Yes.
- No. No, no. Please.
- David.
- No!
- David, it will relieve the pain.
You're gonna be fine. Just fine.
A little alcohol on that.
I'll be right back.
- Hello, Carl.
- What do you want?
Well, uh, I have a little piece of news for you, and, uh, I thought rather than call, you'd appreciate it if I came by and told you personally.
Are you sure the college can manage without you for an afternoon?
Class is suspended for the day for the funeral of one of the students.
Steve Randall, the team's star fullback.
It's a dangerous game, football.
I've always thought it should be outlawed.
Oh, he didn't die of a football injury.
Heart attack.
Too bad.
- David around?
- Working in the lab.
I'd like to say hello to him.
Uh, look.
I have just said that we're busy, and you just said that you had something to tell me.
Well, I was gonna try to soften the blow, but since you're not being very civil,
I might just as well drop it on ya.
The board rejected your request for an extension of the grant.
Fine. Good-bye.
You don't seem very upset about it.
I'm too busy to bother about it now.
Just too busy.
- Feeling better?
- Doctor, what is this?
I feel like my guts are being rearranged.
Your system is changing to assimilate the venom.
[ Whimpering 1
It's time for you to lie down.
- Where are we?
- The storm cellar.
It's almost soundproof, in case you're considering shouting.
Shoufing?
You're goddamn right
I'm gonna shout.
- What are you doing to that boy?
- Call it a Halloween prank.
His face... was distorted.
It looked like he was turning into a snake or something.
Very perceptive of you.
But, of course, you know that's impossible, don't you?
All I know is you're insane, and I intend to have you locked up.
What is this?
Is this some kind of joke?
I hope you find it amusing.
There's a key for that lock in those tanks.
You know, I was so impressed with your lecture on the difference between the coral snake and the king.
You know,
"red touch yellow, kill a fellow"?
I was hoping you might enlighten me on the difference between these two.
Now, in one of these tanks, we have the Western Hognose, which we both know is completely harmless.
And in one of these tanks is the Hognose Pit Viper, which we both know is highly venomous.
You have a decision to make.
I advise you to make a good one.
You're free to go whenever you wish.
Just reach in a tank and pick a key.
I'm sure you won't have any trouble picking the right key...
Dr. Daniels.
Of course.

- Hello.
- Dad.
I'm here at the cargo office, and they don't seem to have any record of it.
They don't? That's odd.
Well, you know Brazilian mail, Kristy.
It's about as botched up as our own.
Right.
Well, do you have the order?
No. The shipping agent phoned.
What was that?
- Uh, bad connection.
- How's David?
- He's greatly improved.
- Can I talk to him?
At the moment, he's resting.
Oh. Well, make sure you tell him
I asked about him.
Yes.
What do you want me to do about the urutu?
Well, when it arrives, tell them to hold it, and we'll make some kind of arrangements to get it here.
Okay. Well, listen,
I'll wait here until morning, and if it doesn't arrive,
I'll just drive back again.
Fine.
And don't forget to tell David I called.
- I won't, Kristy. Good night.
- Good night.
[ Whimpering 1
Kristina sends her love.
You so interested in snakes,
I got a beauty for ya.
Oh, yeah?
What kind of snake?
Don't know the name of it, but it sure is the biggest one I ever saw.
Fella down at the carnival's got it in his freak show.
Half-snake and half-man.
Sure worth a look-see.
Oh, come on. You don't really believe all that stuff, do you?
I've seen a lot of freak shows.
Used to be a donnicker man with the Westcott Brothers
Amusements of the World.
53 years on the circuit, never seen one like that before.
Well, I'm sure it's just a python made to look like a man.
His blue eyes sure fooled me.
Never heard of a snake with blue eyes.
- Where did you say this carnival was?
- Couple of blocks down off Main.
Better hurry though, because they'd be closin' down about now.
There's sure one born every minute, ain't there?
Patch says that he can't spring
Chip until next Wednesday.
He keeps gaffing that wheel,
Jimmy Jr.'s gonna dump him.
Chip gives the whole show a bad rap.
Marks don't believe in nothing anymore.
Yeah.
Come on in. Come on in.
Here, sit down.
Take the load off.
I know you're closed, but, uh,
I was wondering if you would let me see the snakeman?
The snakeman?
Well, how do you like that?
The snakeman's got himself a late date with a little chicken.
- He expectin' you?
- I know this sounds crazy.
But, you see,
I know a lot about snakes, and I was just wondering if you would let me see him.
Well, the snakeman's sleeping now.
You come back tomorrow, and you can have a nice, long look.
- I'll be glad to pay you.
- I told you, he's sleeping.
You see, this is an entertainment, girlie, it's not an all-night diner.
I don't think it's clear to you how very important it is for me to see him.
You heard me. Beat it.
- Good night, honey.
- See you around, baby.
Hoo-hoo.
All right.

Oh, God!
Oh, Tim!
Oh, no! Oh, Tim!
Oh, Tim!
Hey! Hey, you!
Hey, you! Come back here!
Oh, no. No, not David, too. No.
No.
- Dale?
- Hmm?
- There's a girl here to see you.
- Well, she pretty?
She's pretty upset.
She says she killed Steve Randall.
I knew he was in training.
I mean, I knew it was bad for athletes to get overexerted.
But I couldn't help myself.
I loved him too much.
Well, just how much did you love him?
Three times. His poor heart!
- Three times?
- I mean, he looked a little tired.
He told me this story about how he killed this snake.
Snake? I don't know anything about that.
This girl made a pass at him.
Girls are always making passes at Steve.
He took her home, and it turned out that she was Dr. Stoner's daughter.
And there was this big snake.
Stoner.
Excuse me, Dale.
I just got a call from Dr. Daniels's wife.
She's worried because he didn't come home last night.
Well, tell her to check the girls' dorms.
Well, the last she heard, he was on his way to Stoner's place.
Stoner.
All right.
Let's go.
Thank you, miss.
The last one, David.
And, unfortunately, the most painful.
- But think of it as your baptism.
- Oh, no.
The final agony of your old life as a puny human.
And the beginning of your new existence.
A new existence for all mankind.
You are the future, David.
Just as Adam was the first man, you are the first creature of the next evolution.
You will survive pollution, the holocaust, the famines, and the plagues that will make man extinct.
You will survive and multiply and prevail.
Hit it.
Long live the king.
A new life, David.
A bright, clean new life.
Your Highness,
I'd like an audience with you.
I command it.
Your Majesty, I regret to inform you, there is a pretender to your throne.
A king with the power of a cobra, but with the intelligence of a man.
The creature is different from...
A creature who is different from...
It's natural for you to resist change.
And...
...change is the hope...
...of the world.
Great... change...
...is...
Dad! Dad!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Dad, I saw Tim! I saw him!
What did you do to David?
Dad! Dad!
David! Da-David!
My father's dead!
David! David!
David! David!
No! No! David, no!
No! No!
Oh, no! David!
Okay. Hold it.
Is it all right if we get back to work now?
Thanks awfully. Sorry to be such a bore.
Not at all, Lady Charlotte.
It's rather fun.
Mr. Graham.
Hogan, your job is to look after the amphib, not lug that stuff around.
Well, one of us has to be nice to the lady, major.
Plucky little woman. Bit of a responsibility on a trip like this, though.
Didn't have a choice, Captain.
We agreed to take a reporter from the newspaper that financed us.
- They sent her.
- Be fair, Ben, she does take good pictures.
Maybe. But she's one problem
I could do without.
If the weather holds, we should reach the last known position of your friend Tyler in 3 days.
At which point, we should sight the coastline of this mysterious ice continent he describes in his log.
You sound as though you still have your doubts, Captain.
If we did, major, The Royal Navy wouldn't be helping you.
No, it was the specimens that Tyler included in this canister.
And when Dr. Norfolk here, confirmed that they were genuine...
Why do you think
I went to the top man in Europe?
Oh, now, hardly, Ben.
Dr. Schenkelman in Vienna...
Oh, come on, doctor.
If it hadn't been for your word,
The London Times would never have agreed to back this expedition, and you know it.
I don't think I'll ever forget the day when Major Ben McBride walked into my room at the Natural
History Museum with that canister.
- Almost spilled your hot milk, didn't you?
- It was quite a moment, Ben.
Tyler makes it sound a very dangerous place.
A continent full of cavemen and dinosaurs?
Do you really believe there's a chance that Tyler may still be alive?
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
Doc knows where I stand.
- I don't give a damn about dinosaurs.
- I'm still hoping to convert him.
Boy, I'm sure glad we're going in by air, major.
Me, too, Hogan.
I'd hate to have to climb that.
I'd say it was almost impossible.
And I'm quite good at this sort of thing.
- Did I ever tell you about the Matterhorn?
- Once or twice.
- Just how long have we got, Captain?
- 3 to 4 weeks. Half what we planned, but we hadn't expected so much pack ice.
If it closes in on us...
Come on, Captain. This ship is built like the rock of Gibraltar.
It may be, Mr. Hogan, but that ice could crush this hull like a matchbox.
- And if that happened...
- There'll be no trip home for any of us.
Okay, Hogan, let's winch the amphibian into the water.
The sooner we get airborne, the better.
- Hogan!
- Okay, let's go.
McBride to Polar Queen, flying southwest. Altitude 3,000 feet.
Still no breaks in the ice.
Turning southeast, and climbing at 5,000 feet. Over.
Roger. Polar Queen listening. Over.
McBride to Polar Queen, still no break in the ice wall.
Course south by southwest. Over.
Polar Queen to McBride, your signal is badly distorted.
What is your present course? Over.
Can't give you...
Polar Queen to McBride, Say again. Over.
Mainly static for the last 2 hours, sir, but they're still transmitting, and I think they're still airborne.
At least they're alive.
And they've flown over 200 miles.
Must be well over the ice wall by now.
Hey, what the...
It's a pterodactyl!
Absolutely magnificent!
Coming in on the starboard, major!
Here he comes. Look at the size!
Look out! He's close!
Hogan!
Right.
Coming in at port, major.
Hold on! This may be a little rough.
- I'll try to smooth out the bumps next time.
- Nonsense. You did extremely well.
- Still in one piece?
- Just. How about the plane?
- Hogan?
- Yeah.
- What kind of shape we in?
- Well, not good. But it's fixable.
McBride to Polar Queen, can you read me? Over.
Polar Queen to McBride, your signal's very faint. Go ahead.
We have been attacked by a giant pterodactyl.
Good Lord!
Damage to amphib... had to make forced landing...
Polar Queen to McBride, this is Captain Lawton.
How bad is damage to plane?
McBride to Polar Queen, acknowledge my message. Over.
I say again, how bad is damage to plane?
- No dice?
- It's hard to tell.
- Not much they could do anyway.
- Well, if they sail away, we're sunk.
Nobody's gonna sail away, Hogan.
There's plenty of time for everything.
- Any luck, Mr. Graham?
- No, sir. They've stopped transmitting.
Will they get that plane back into the air?
There's no way we can send a rescue party in over those cliffs.
- What the devil are we going to do, sir?
- We're going to wait, Mr. Whitby.
We shall chart this section of the coastline, and we shall stay here as long as we can.
- Mount a 24-hour listening watch, Mr. Graham?
- Aye, aye, sir.
But supposing the ice closes in, sir.
Let me worry about that, will you,
Mr. Whitby? Start work on the charts, please.
Aye, aye, sir!
Ready... heave!
Ready... heave!
Okay. Let's take 5.
What we really need is a winch.
- Yeah, well, we haven't got one.
- You know, what we really need is a winch.
Yeah.
We must remember to bring one next time.
Go easy on that stuff, Hogan.
It's just a little "nerve tonic," major.
The war, remember?
- Well, this isn't the western front.
- You're absolutely right. It's worse.
No, no, believe me. I was there.
Pterodactyls are far more interesting than Germans.
Interesting?
Doc, you professor types are all the same.
Pterodactyls?
You give me the Red Baron any day.
Anyway, all I want to do Is fix up that amphibian and get us the hell out of here.
What are you talking about?
We just started.
We came here to get Tyler, and that's what we're going to do.
You better call in the Navy, because we are going to need some reinforcements.
You worry too much, Hogan.
Get that prop fixed and check out the tail.
- How's it going?
- Oh, quite well, thank you.
Oh, could I have a photograph of you?
Well, yeah.
Where do you want me?
That rock will do fine.
Makes a good background.
Right.
Okay.
Hold it.
I think McBride's found something you might like to look at.
Really?
You're a real barrel of laughs, you know it?
A fully grown stegosaurus.
Now, isn't that absolutely beautiful?
I hope you appreciate this moment, Ben.
Aren't they supposed to be very docile and very stupid?
- Well, in theory, yes.
- Especially the female of the species.
You know, I've got a feeling we've just found our winch.
Why don't we use him to tow the amphib out?
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
It looks big enough.
But suppose he doesn't want to.
All we've got to do is tie a rope to his tail and make him run away.
- They should make a good anchor point.
- Yeah.
- Is he going to feel this?
- No, not yet.
His nervous system works about 100 times slower than ours.
I hope you're right.
Hogan!
- Ready?
- Hold onto your hat.
Hey! Charly!
Get the hell out of the way, goddamn it!
Keep your shirt on.
Go on! Go on!
Go on!
Go!
She's clear!
Now, how are we going to stop it?
Major!
Attaboy, major!
Come on, major!
I'm going for the rocks!
Major!
Oh, boy.
Isn't it marvelous? It worked!
You almost got yourself killed.
Listen, your family's newspaper may be paying for this trip, but from now on, just quit clowning around. Understand?
Come on. Now, don't get sore at the major.
Look, I was with him for three years in France. He's all right.
He's just a little worried about what he's got us into, you being a lady and all.
You promised to forget that, remember?
As for McBride, don't worry,
I can look after myself.
I'm going to have to cut about 10 inches off each of those blades to balance them off.
Then we're going to lose a lot of thrust.
Will it get us in the air?
If none of us has too big a breakfast, yes.
How long do you figure it'll take?
Well, with the rudder and all the other items, it's going to be... it's going to be about 3 or 4 days.
Can't afford to lose that much time.
- You two game to go in on foot?
- Yes!
- Yes.
- You're crazy!
For all we know, Tyler could be sitting just on the other side of these hills.
We get up to that ridge, we may be able to see some of those peaks he described.
We'll be heading due south.
In 3 days time, I'll send up a flare, at 9:00 in the morning and 3:00 in the afternoon.
We could be back before you're through here.
- What about the goddamn monsters?
- Trust me.
I looked after you in France, didn't I?
The way I remember it,
I was the one who saved your life.
That's what I mean, Hogan.
I owe you one, right?
Right.
Well, let's get started.
You still annoyed at having to bring me along?
No, not really. It's just that certain kinds of girls are hard to take.
Oh, you mean my kind?
Well, the world's a changing place, McBride.
You know what the real problem is?
You just can't stand competition.
Lady, I believe in a man doing a man's work, that's all.
- What is it, doc?
- It can only be one thing... prehistoric.
Definitely prehistoric.
That's human.
Ben!
- You hurt?
- No. Thanks.
A genuine cavegirl.
She'll suit you perfectly.
She's all yours, doc. You're the expert.
In fossils, perhaps.
This is a little outside my field.
Don't touch!
She speaks English.
- That's crazy.
- No, it doesn't make sense.
Ben. See this knife she's carrying?
It's a Bowie knife.
I don't know how the hell she got it.
Well, yes, she must have been in contact with Tyler.
- Tyler.
- Good God! She knows the name.
What is your name?
Ajor.
Ajor, listen, did Tyler teach you to speak our language?
Yes. He teach you, too?
No. Tyler and me learned together.
Grow up together.
Tyler is a friend of mine.
I guess he's a friend of yours, too?
Was good man... all gone.
Gone now.
Ajor has no friends.
- No people.
- Pull that photograph of Tyler.
Ajor...
Look.
Go on... take it.
Your friend Tyler seems to have made quite an impression.
Why don't you... go and light a fire or something?
Right, I've got the whole story.
She comes from a race of people called the Galu.
It's a Stone Age tribe, or at least it was when Tyler and a girl called Lisa stumbled into one of their settlements.
Lisa, wasn't that the girl that Tyler rescued?
That's right. The only other survivor of the original party.
Go on.
Well, it appears that Tyler and the girl were welcomed by the Galu
- and lived with them for more than 2 years.
- I'm glad somebody's friendly.
During that time, they taught the Galu farming skills, generally helped them advance from the Stone Age into the Iron Age.
Why is she so upset over Tyler's picture?
Because another more advanced race, called the Naga, didn't like the competition.
They massacred every Galu they could lay their hands on.
Is... Tyler dead?
Well, there's a chance that Tyler and Lisa may have been captured.
The Nagas usually sacrifice their prisoners to appease their volcano god.
Well, in this case, it would make more sense to keep them alive.
Their knowledge would help the advance of the Nagas.
Well, I hope not.
They sound a pretty vile bunch.
Ajor was one of the few Galus to escape.
And she's been on the run ever since.
- When did all this happen?
- About 4 months ago.
Then there's a good chance that Tyler may still be alive.
Can Ajor take us to where the Nagas live?
Goddamn it, another one. I told you...
I told you what I was going to do.
I told you.
Don't these things ever sleep?
The island never sleeps.
Here.
Take it away! Take it away! Take it away!
Oh, God!
- That's a big one.
- Oh, that's a beauty!
That's a Poecilotheria fasciata.
It's not funny!
I don't believe it, Charly.
I thought nothing could faze you.
Hairy plane ride, Ajor's friend in the forest, you took them on without blinking an eye.
- And along comes this little spider...
- Little?
It was cute.
It was kind of cuddly, too, wasn't it?
Now, stop it.
You're making my flesh creep.
At least it proves you're human.
Well, everyone has their breaking point, McBride.
With me, it's spiders.
With you... it's me.
- What is it?
- Band-lu.
- A hunting party?
- I hope they're not hunting us.
In that case,
I shall try and get a picture.
Hold it.
Galu! Galu!
Flare pistol.
Ajor, no!
His name is Mikay.
He was good friend of Tyler.
Did he have time to say anything about Tyler?
He was taken with many others to mountain of skulls, the city where the Nagas live.
- Can you take us there?
- Yes. But it's hopeless.
Even if you can get in, you can never escape Nagoramata.
- Who's he?
- The volcano god of the Nagas.
He rules the land.
No one can go against his will and live.
- Where's Ajor going?
- She's looking for the entrance to a cave.
If she finds it, it'll make life a lot easier.
We'd be crazy to go over the top if there's a shortcut.
Ben!
Get out of here!
You bounder!
Leave me! Leave me!
He's awake.
Ben? Ben, can you hear me?
Norfolk, Charly, you all right?
We thought you were dead.
Where are we?
At the entrance of the Band-lu camp, behind you, up the slope.
Any idea what they plan to do with us?
I think we're some sort of offering.
These stakes were in the ground when we got here.
You mean a sacrificial offering?
No.
No, not religious.
Something more practical.
Somebody's dinner then?
Sorry, Charly.
You're okay, you know that?
I think it's better not to talk.
Some of them hunt by sound, rather than smell.
Oh, good girl, my notes.
I get for you. Band-lu not see.
Great. No gun, no ammunition.
God knows what we'll do if they follow us.
They won't. They're afraid to cross over the boundary.
Hogan to Polar Queen.
Hogan to Polar Queen.
Look, I can't hear you. I just hope you're still out there, all right?
Our repairs to the plane are just about finished. I still have to test-fly the ship.
If she checks out all right, then I'm going to look out for the major.
From what I've seen of this place, there's going to be a problem in trying to find somewhere to land.
Anyway, the deal is, if they're not back after 3 weeks, I fly out on my own.
So don't you go on off without me, you hear?
Some deal.
Anyway, it's nice talking to you.
This is Hogan. Out.
What do you think of it, Norfolk?
Absolutely remarkable!
Do you think it's safe?
There's only one way to find out...
Keep moving.
Charly.
Come on! That's it, that's it!
Okay, baby, don't you let me down!
Okay, let her go! Move it up!
This is the country of the Nagas.
- Looks pretty grim.
- So are the Nagas.
It's 9:00. Time to put up a flare.
Nagas!
Welcome.
You are surprised I speak your tongue.
Your friend Tyler, he has taught us much already.
- We heard he was a prisoner.
- And you came to rescue him?
Did that creature fill you with these lies?
Tyler's a man of great power who honors us with his presence.
It is he who sent me to welcome you. Come with me.
I can't believe Tyler talking these guys around.
- Well, you always said he was a survivor.
- Yeah, but how did he know we were coming?
Good question. Unfortunately, we have to visit the mountain of skulls to learn the answer.
Goddamn it! When I put you together, you stay together!
Oh, no!
No, no, I haven't heard from the major yet.
Should be back any day now.
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?
Okay, Hogan. Over and out.
Hogan? Yeah?
If I don't get out of here, you're gonna go bananas.
Yeah.
- I thought you were going to see Tyler.
- So did I.
Hold your tongue! Only Sabbala speaks.
Take your hands off me!
Let me go.
Let me go!
Nagoramata.
Good fortune smiles upon you.
Soon you will become brides of Nagoramata.
Ben?
- Ben McBride!
- Bowen!
No... it's not possible!
Yes, it's me.
- It's Tyler, he's right next door.
- Wonderful!
You son of a gun, we'd almost given up hope of finding you.
Yes, we had a rough time getting here.
Anyway, thank goodness we found you.
- You mean, you came here to find me?
- Sure. We got the message from the canister.
Yeah, it was picked up off the coast of Scotland at the end of 1917.
Oh, my name is Edwin Norfolk, by the way.
Good to meet you, sir.
Ben.
Sabbala say,
"soon your bodies will feel warmth
"of Nagoramata's love.
Your heads will help build new temple
"in his honor."
Did he say when?
At the rising of his sister... the sun.
Ben.
I...
- I'd given up hope.
- Yeah, I know. Me, too.
My folks, Ben, how are they?
Your ma and pa are both fine.
In fact, it was your pa that got me into this thing.
He hasn't changed much, has he?
It didn't take much persuading.
Ben... the war?
It's over, Bo. There'll be plenty of time to talk about that.
Right now, the girls who came with us are in trouble.
Girls?
- Sabbala?
- Yeah, and he looks like bad news.
He is.
Well, in that case, we haven't got a moment to waste.
One of the girls is a friend of yours... Ajor.
Ajor, the Galu?
Yeah. I'll explain later.
Where have they got Lisa?
She's dead.
Sabbala killed her.
We wouldn't cooperate with the Nagas.
Looks as though they gave you a pretty rough time.
They smashed 2 years of hard work.
Wiped out a whole race of people.
Sacrificed Lisa to the volcano.
No!
Ben, my stick.
Barricade the door.
Nagoramata! When he speaks, all die!
Ben, we gotta go down here.
It's the only way.
- My camera!
- Forget it.
No, look, it's just in there.
Along with your notes.
- Yes, yes, I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Norfolk!
Norfolk!
Hurry!
Stay where you are!
Wait till they settle down.
- Charly, this is no time for pictures.
- Shut up and help.
Okay, now, you've got to wind that up there, underneath.
And that sets it off there, but don't forget to close your eyes.
Get set to run on the count of 3.
Ben... you go on ahead. I'll slow 'em down.
Give you a chance to get through that cave.
How you gonna stop 'em? With rocks?
No dice, Bo. I didn't come all this way to leave you behind.
What the hell, Ben?
I buy it here or I buy it later.
We may get away from the Nagas, but we'll never get home.
Once we get to that amphib, we're home and dry.
The land'll stop you, Ben. It's alive.
That volcano is its heart.
It controls everything.
- How can the land be alive?
- Ask Ajor if we can get out of here.
Only wish I had something to hold them off with.
Here, take this.
And this spare magazine.
- Move! Norfolk!
- Go on.
Go on!
In! Go in!
Bo!
- Stupid, goddamn stunt.
- No!
Easy.
Remember...
- when we were kids, Ben?
- Yeah.
I always wanted to play the hero.
Easy.
Only then... arrows weren't real.
- Easy.
- Ben...
I told you... there's... there's no escape.
Goddamn it.
Where's Tyler?
Ajor!
Hogan calling Polar Queen.
Hogan calling Polar Queen!
Are you receiving me?
Come on! Get off!
Oh, no!
Come on! Steady.
Dirty old nag!
Come on!
Get out of it!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Let go! Help! Let go!
Ajor, get back! Get back!
Move!
Ben!
Get out of here! Get out of here!
Go on!
We've got to move now, sir.
If those icebergs close in...
Very well, Mr. Whitby.
Get her underway, will you?
We'll move back 5 miles. Be ready to transmit our position in case they make contact.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Engine room, prepare to get underway.
- You okay?
- Oh, just.
I didn't believe what Tyler said about this island.
- I'm beginning to think he was right.
- It's a complete and utter disaster.
Come on, it's not as bad as that.
We're doing okay.
I'm not talking about that.
I've lost my satchel in there.
All my notes and everything!
Don't worry. I've still got my camera.
Boatswain reports channel clear, sir.
- Very good, Mr. Whitby. Keep her moving.
- Very good, sir.
Band-lu. Make them go away with fire gun.
- I've run out of flares. How about you, Ben?
- Three shots left.
For heaven's sake, I'm sick and tired of running away from those dreadful people.
Get up.
Get going, Charly. Otherwise I'll kick your butt from here to the plane.
You'd never be a major in the British army.
Goddamn it, major, where the hell are you?
- Anything at all, Mr. Graham?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
Keep transmitting our position. And let them know we're moving out in the morning.
I'll be damned! Major!
Come on!
Okay, let's move it.
Come on!
- You didn't get Tyler?
- No, but I brought you a present.
- Got any of that "nerve tonic" left?
- Yeah, I sure have.
You cut it pretty fine, major.
I was worried this whole place was going to shake apart before you got back here.
It's about to.
We're being followed by a volcano.
Yeah... what?
Ajor, don't worry.
Everything'll be all right.
We've lost a lot of thrust on that cut-down prop, major.
You'll have to open her right up on the chocks or we'll never get out of here!
Hogan!
All clear! Let's go, major!
She won't climb any higher.
We have to lighten the ship.
Norfolk, throw out everything you can!
It's our only hope. Out!
My camera! My camera!
Major! We did it!
McBride to Polar Queen. McBride to
Polar Queen, how do you read me? Over.
What the devil's going on?
Any luck, major?
The ship! The ship!
Great going!
Look, sir!
It's them! The amphib!
He has no power.
By God, they've made it!
- Muster rescue party.
- Very good, sir.
"Congratulations on incredible escape.
Safe voyage home."
May I also add my congratulations to that?
And also, for...
Mr. Graham, you... and also for bringing back such a charming souvenir.
Oh, yes, sir. It's all rather fun.
Why, that's not bad.
That's not bad at all.
You know, I can't wait to walk you down the main street of North Flats, Nebraska.
Nebraska? No volcanoes?
No, but they're sure gonna explode when they see you.
You know, Hogan, this is rather like your "nerve tonic."
Professor, have some of the real thing.
Thank you.
That makes life look a lot rosier.
You know, my uncle will have a heart attack when we get back empty-handed.
In fact, he'll probably fire me.
Maybe you weren't meant to make your name in pictures.
- Got any other ideas?
- I'll think of something.
- Charly?
- Yes?
Why didn't you tell me about that gun you had stashed in your camera case?
I was keeping it in case we got into a jam.
Hit it, hit it!
Way to go.
I'm trying here.
Way to go, Jay Parks!
Okay, let's go.
Forward eye.
6-22. X-3. Okay?
Right.
On one, on one. Ready?
Six.
Six.
Two.
Six. Three. Four.
My name is Morgan.
I play football.
We worked our butts off trying to get it together for the big Sunday game.
So the coach told us to knock it off, and relax for a few days.
One of my teammates, Davis, came up with the idea that we head out to the island.
He went ahead to make the arrangements.
I talked our PR man, Brian, into coming along.
I felt the day off would do him some good, too.
It'll be great to be in the country again, and enjoy some of the open spaces that man hasn't screwed up with his technology.
My father used to say, "Morgan,
"one of these days the earth will get even
"with man for messing her up with his garbage.
"Just let man continue to pollute the earth
"the way he is, and nature will rebel.
"And it's going to be one hell of a rebellion."
Of course,
I never took him seriously, but I still remember the way he looked at me when he said,
"You'll never know when and where it's going to happen.
"And once it starts, you'll never know how and when it'll stop."
It's funny how my father's prediction comes to mind when I go to the country, like today.
Venison tonight, right?
.We haven't got him yet
We will.
They've got it!
Go on, beat it.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Come on, Davis. We won. The poor bastard lost. What more do you want?
Get out of here.
Hey, come on, let him go.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
You stay with him, Brian,
I'll be right back, okay?
Hello.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello?
Where the hell did you get those goddamn chickens?
Hey, do you know those bastards almost killed me, huh?
You had no business in there.
Look, my name is Morgan.
I need a telephone.
There's been a bad accident in the woods out there.
My friend is dead.
We don't have no phone.
Well, where can I find one?
None nearby, you can't.
We're the only farm on this end of the island.
What? No one else?
That horse, did you get it from the stable near the ferry landing?
Yes, I did.
Well, when you take it back, they got a phone.
Thanks a lot. By the time I get there I won't need one.
Please, mister...
Could you take a look at something that scared the wits out of me?
Hey, look, lady, I've already seen your chickens.
No.
No, this is something else.
I wouldn't ask if Mr. Skinner was here.
The Lord knows I wouldn't.
But I'm frightened they've got to it.
What do you mean, "they"?
Please, mister, will you take a quick look, and tell me if you think, it's what I think it is?
Please.
Look.
Do those look like ratholes to you?
Yeah, they sure do.
I knew it.
They got at the food.
They must've.
Is this what you've been feeding those chickens?
No. This is the way it comes to us from the Lord.
The chickens won't touch none of it, unless we mix it with the meal and the bran.
Yeah, well, that wasp seems to like it well enough.
I mean, what is it?
The good Lord give it to us
'cause we're deserving people.
And we pray regularly, we do.
And the Lord is going to see to it that we don't need money no more. Never.
Look, lady,
I don't think you realize how dangerous this stuff could really be.
Mr. Skinner's in the city this minute, making a big, important money deal for this food.
That's what he's doing, right now, at the same time we're standing here talking.
Yeah, but that's not gonna help very much if something besides those chickens have gotten into this food.
Well, nothing on our farm killed your friend, if that's what you're thinking.
Lady, how large do you think those rats will grow if they've gotten into this food of yours, huh?
Mr. Skinner'll know what to do, no matter what ate it up.
He'll know exactly what to do.
Yeah, well, I hope so, because I'll be coming back.
I didn't think we'd be going back like this.
Yeah.
What do we do now?
I guess we let the coroner figure it out.
We gotta tell him what we think, don't we?
No, I don't think so.
I mean, we'd sound like a couple of prize idiots telling the District Attorney a giant something or other killed our buddy, wouldn't we?
How many times you been busted up playing pro ball?
I don't know.
I don't think there's a guy in the league who hasn't been laid out once or twice.
Except Davis.
Been playing with the team for seven years.
Never even been carried off the field.
Yeah, so what's the point?
So, what I want to know is, how does a guy with all that luck have this happen to him?
Well, I guess his luck ran out.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Yes?
Anything happen today, sir?
Happen?
Like, unusual.
Well, a man was killed stag hunting on one of the islands.
Fell off his horse.
You mean, unusual like that?
Not exactly.
I saw the body.
His two friends brought him across.
He was all swollen and ugly.
You know what I mean?
I don't suppose his friends said anything about seeing some big things, did they?
Anything of that sort, sir?
God!
Oh, God!
Who's there?
Lord, save me, save me.
I just came from the coroner's office.
Yeah, what'd he say?
From the amount of poison in his body, he estimates that Davis was stung by no less than 250 wasps.
Jesus.
Come on, let's go.
Where to?
The farm.
Come on, what do you want to go out there for?
The ride.
Well, I'd like to go along with you, but I'm splitting for
Chicago tonight, remember?
Come on, Brian, will you?
Hey, baby, if I don't set up that promotion in Chicago, you jocks ain't gonna have too many fans watching you play football.
Come on, you know darn well you don't have to be there for at least two days.
Well, all right.
If the truth were known,
I'm really not all that ecstatic about going out there with you, Morgan, you know.
Oh, Tom, come on.
Please hurry.
Tom, get it going.
Oh!
Oh, please stop.
Please.
Please, please stop!
Why didn't you stop?
What for?
The girl was pregnant.
So?
So she wanted something, Jack.
Maybe they were in trouble. lt can wait.
We'll pick them up on the way back
You don't care about anybody but yourself, do you?
Is that what you think of me?
I think you're the most selfish man I know.
So why do you work for me?
Because jobs for female bacteriologists are just not that easy to find, Jack.
So who told you to be one?
You're a bastard, did you know that?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Oh, Tom,
I don't know what we're gonna do.
.Just stay calm
Don't worry about a thing, sweetheart.
Who put this goddamn gate here?
Hey, what's that?
Oh, my God!
What do you suppose killed them?
Well, whatever it was, it did a good job on the barn doors.
I'm really impressed, Jack
. How about you?
Well, I don't know. You can't tell much when they're dead.
How do we know some clown didn't make this thing out of plaster of Paris and a handful of ostrich feathers?
Let's see if we can find Ma and Pa Kettle.
I don't see anybody.
Mr. Skinner!
Hello!
Anybody around?
He said he'd be here.
Well, maybe he's out back, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I thought you was...
Well, I don't know what...
My heads all mixed up.
It was them coming in.
Mr. Skinner said they would.
What happened to your arm?
It was the big worms, miss, crawling horrible things.
And then the rats came.
Rats?
In the barn, awful giant rats.
Well, we're looking for
Mr. Skinner.
What do you want him for?
Well, we were supposed to meet him out here today.
Mr. Skinner didn't come home last night.
Maybe he stayed over in the city.
Well, that doesn't matter. You can show us whatever you have out here.
But Mr. Skinner never stays away overnight. Never.
Are you trying to tell me I've wasted my time coming out here?
Did you make a money deal with him?
No, not exactly.
Then, I'm afraid I can't show you our secret.
It wouldn't be right.
Look, I didn't travel all the way out here to this goddamn hole to see some dead chicken carcasses.
Now, do you have something you want to sell or haven't you?
Hold it, Jack. Why don't you just try being a little human for a change?
Mrs. Skinner, we have to get back to the city.
Couldn't you show us what your husband fed the chickens?
I won't let Mr. Bensington take advantage of you, I promise.
All right, miss, I'll show you.
I don't care what happens.
I just want my husband to be with me again.
See?
That's what your husband brought us out here for?
Just like Mr. Skinner found it.
Just like that one day.
At first he thought it was oil, and it was gonna make us rich.
Come on, Lorna.
But wait a minute, Jack, wait a minute. Look at this.
I've never seen anything like it.
Mrs. Skinner, how did your husband happen to feed it to the chickens?
Well, when we found out it weren't no oil,
There was nothing to do about it, so we fed it to the chicks.
Right out of the ground like that?
No, miss.
Nothing'll eat it unless we mix it with chicken feed.
And did all the chickens grow?
Only the baby chicks.
Nothing seemed to effect the grown ones.
Nothing at all.
Nothing happens to the full-grown chickens, is that right?
Well, they didn't grow none, if that's what you mean.
But I didn't say nothing happened to them.
Well, what did happen?
They got ate by the real big ones.
Come on, Lorna.
Mrs. Skinner...
I don't like you.
Well, if that stuff is worth anything,
I'd like an option until Miss Scott, here gets the stuff analyzed.
I don't want nothing more to do with you.
You didn't take me seriously back there, did you?
I was only having a little joke.
Jack, look!
Oh, thank you.
Did you see them?
It was last night.
They were right there in the middle of the road.
Right in front of us.
We almost hit one.
What were they?
They couldn't have been what they looked like.
Yes, they were.
They were these huge rats.
I've never seen anything so ugly in my life.
All right, we'll pull you out and you follow us.
It won't help.
I busted my rear axle.
Are you going back into the city?
Well, we have to make a stop at a farm, first, then we'll be going right back.
Okay, but if we're still here, can we get a ride back with you then?
I think you'd better come with us now.
Oh, that's all right, we'll be okay.
We'll just stay inside the bus.
Morgan.
You okay?
Damn fortunate you happened along.
Yeah. Well, actually, we didn't just happen along.
We came out here to see Mr. Skinner.
What about?
Are you Mr. Skinner?
No, I'm not Mr. Skinner.
Do you know about the food the Skinners have up here?
Yeah, a little.
Well, I can tell you right now, if you're entertaining any intentions of becoming involved, you're too late.
My company controls all rights.
Well, then, maybe it's not Mr. Skinner
I want to see after all, is it?
I'm not interested in any partners.
Until Mr. Skinner comes home and says he wants you to have our food,
Mr. Bensington, nobody owns nothing but us.
The good Lord give it to us to do as we please.
Well, it would appear you were just moved back three spaces and lose a turn.
Well, anyway, my company has first refusal.
Miss Scott here was present when
Mr. Skinner made us an offer.
That was yesterday morning.
Well, then, I suppose legally, you just might be right.
No question about it.
Good.
When I throw our charges with the district attorney, I'll know who to name.
What the hell are you talking about?
Second degree murder, I guess that's what they'll call it.
My friend was killed by your wasps yesterday afternoon.
They're not my wasps.
Well, if you own the stuff that made them grow,
I guess you're liable for whatever they do.
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, we'll wait more than a minute.
My buddy here and I are going to give you a hand in cleaning them out.
Well, you'd better get the hell off this land. You're trespassing.
Sorry, can't do that.
We'll have to get the wasps in their nests, and they don't go home till after dark.
Dirty bastards!
I'm Lorna Scott.
Oh, you're with
Mr. Wonderful over there?
I'm in charge of the bacteriostasis in his plant, yes.
It must be fascinating work.
Since you're dying to know what it is, I shall tell you.
I keep the bacteria growth within an acceptable tolerance.
How interesting.
Brian, we're gonna need something that'll work for a wick.
Maybe some rope rubbed down with powder from our shotgun shells, and some plaster or cement.
See if the Skinners have any, okay?
You don't like women around when you're doing your thing, do you?
What's my thing?
Facing danger.
I don't mind.
Are you sure?
What's there to mind?
Oh, can I come along?
Why not?
It won't be easy, but I think
I can learn to like you.
You're the first man I've met who has balls enough to beat Bensington at one-upmanship.
Really?
You're nice yourself.
Thomas, she kicked.
Right here.
Like what you see?
I realize I'm not very attractive being so pregnant and all, but...
No, it's not that.
I just guess the whole thing wasn't such a good idea, after all.
I just thought we could see things more clearly.
Thomas, I'm seeing things very clearly, and I'm not going to change my mind.
But it's my baby.
I want it to have my name.
She'll have her own name.
Did anybody ever tell you, you're crazy?
Why? Because I'm happy we're having a baby?
It'll be the same kid even though we're married.
But our relationship won't be, yours and mine.
But what's the difference, damn it?
We're still the same two people.
Just tell me what the difference a lousy marriage certificate has to do with our relationship?
Hey, that is exactly what
I'm talking about. Nothing!
And that's why
I don't want one.
Thomas, look at me.
You love me, don't you?
And I love you.
We live together.
We grow together.
Do you believe that?
It's huge.
Come on, let's get back to the farmhouse.
Oh, God, forgive me for doing bad things.
I swear, I won't sin again if you just return my husband to me.
A doctor ought to be taking care of this, Mrs. Skinner.
The Lord healeth the sick,
Lorna.
That's from the Bible.
Yeah, well, I think maybe you should drive back with us tonight
Oh, no, I can't do that.
When Mr. Skinner returns, he'll want me to be here.
He will.
Mr. Morgan.
Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan.
They got Lorna
God have mercy on the poor girl.
Well, what happened?
I'll show you.
I'll get my gun.
Yeah.
That slope in back of the house.
That's where we saw them.
Then, all at once, they came at us!
And Lorna ran up on the slope, but the earth gave way.
She fell in there.
That's where the big rats went.
But Lorna's down in there.
Lorna!
Lorna, can you hear me?
Morgan!
Morgan, get me out of here!
Okay, I'm coming down.
You're sure they were rats?
- I know a rat when I see one, mister.
- Give me a hand.
They're nearly as big as horses.
Is there anything you didn't feed the food to, Mrs. Skinner?
Brian, get the rope and flashlight from the jeep, okay?
Right.
Oh, Lord.
It's happened, just as
Mr. Skinner said it would.
Being punished 'cause we sinned against nature.
The only sin, Mrs. Skinner, is your goddamn stupidity.
You're not a good man,
Mr. Bensington.
The things you say and do.
You okay?
Yeah.
Hand me the shotgun.
Coming in.
Got it?
Yeah.
Take her up.
Morgan! Morgan!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Morgan!
Morgan!
Morgan!
Careful there.
Where are those ratholes?
There.
There.
Bensington, will you go in with me?
Don't be a fool.
Thanks, Brian.
You okay?
Here.
Thanks to you, kid, we missed the last ferry.
You bastard.
Thomas.
Honey.
Yes?
Please, could you just lift me up, please.
Yeah, sure.
You all right?
Oh, yeah.
It stopped. It stopped
What the hell was that?
Thomas.
Rita. Rita, come to the door.
Come on out.
Tom, what is it?
Oh, my God!
Tom!
Oh, Tom!
Look at them.
Tom.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, Tom, I can't..
They're out there, all over the place.
- They're everywhere. They're everywhere.
- Big rats.
Where? Out there on the road where your camper was?
By the camper, yeah.
Wait, how many were there?
I don't know.
They're all over the road.
Come on, Lorna, we'll drive right through them.
Hold it right there.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This car might be the only way out of here for all of us.
That's why I'm taking it.
If anybody wants to come along, they can come.
Now give me the keys.
Not until I know it's safe.
Safe, hell!
It's my car, god damn it!
Give me the keys.
Okay, Bensington,
I'll give you your keys back, but if you try and take any of these people out of here before
I tell you it's okay, you're gonna have more than rats to fight. You got that?
Hold it a second, Morgan.
How could they get at us inside the car?
Well, after they force us off the road, they'll give us a choice, of either dying inside the car or coming outside and being eaten.
Well, I don't hear you coming up with a better suggestion.
Well, how about this one?
You and I go for a ride in my jeep and take a little look for ourselves, huh?
What the hell for?
I don't know. Maybe those kids exaggerated a little.
- I'm not interested.
- Maybe they exaggerated a lot.
I'm still not interested.
Well, just you and me,
Brian, let's go.
Maybe he's right, Morgan.
His car is closed.
We could plow right through the bastards.
Okay, Brian, you go out there and plow right through the rats with the man.
If you don't make it, no one can say you didn't try.
All right, just tell me one thing, okay?
What the hell are we going out there for?
In this open jeep, we don't stand a chance.
Dumb bastards.
They're even worse than I thought.
Jack?
Jack, the girl is sick.
I don't know what to do.
It's stopped.
She could be having a miscarriage.
Help me! This is the end of it. I want it all!
Didn't you hear what I said?
I said the girl is sick.
She could be dying.
Find every container you can.
Pails, bottles, jugs, anything that'll hold it.
We'll load the car and then get out of here.
You don't give a damn about the girl, do you?
You don't give a damn about anybody, but yourself and money.
Do you know what this food is worth?
Enough millions, you can use
$100 bills for toilet paper.
You can flush it down the toilet without even counting it.
Well, I didn't know that's what you wanted money for, Jack.
I'll give you one thing, though, you're creative.
You're a no good son of a bitch, but you're creative.
What are you stopping for?
What are you doing?
You don't think that's going to keep them out, do you?
I'm going to follow that road, right down there.
That road?
That's the way the rats are coming.
The rats are coming...
Oh, relax, will you, Brian
? Relax.
Well, we're in luck.
The fence runs right into the water.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Morgan!
You saw how big they are.
This goddamn fence isn't going to stop them, nothing's going to stop them.
Well, maybe not.
Even if it did, they can swim.
You know that? Rats can swim.
They'll swim right around the end of it.
No, I don't think so.
I think if they go in the water, they'll sink straight to the bottom.
Come on, are you kidding me?
You ever seen movies of a hippopotamus in the water?
I should swim so well.
Yeah, well, they've been doing it for a hell of a long time.
So have rats.
Yeah, at a weight of about 10 ounces.
So?
At 150 pounds, the gravity pull is gonna make it a whole new thing.
I think they're gonna have to learn how to swim all over again.
You could be wrong.
.And the fence goes to the water on this end, too
If they attack us out here in the open, we're dead.
We've got an unbroken wire fence running across the north side of the island, with water on both sides.
It won't even slow them down.
Charged with electricity, it will.
You should see how funny you look, Jack.
You're scared shitless the rats will come, but you want money badly enough to chance it.
Well, fill this, god damn it!
The stuff is drying up.
I'm beginning to think maybe that stuff should stay right where it is.
What the hell are you talking about?
Well, it doesn't look so good, as a super-contribution to the world, I mean.
Starving people?
And you're going to feed them all with big chickens, right?
Yeah, and giant cows and sheep, and ducks and fish, and you name it!
Yeah, well, it sounds good, but wouldn't bigger creatures have larger appetites?
I'm way ahead of you, kid.
I'm going to take this stuff and have it converted to plant food.
Oh, and you're gonna feed all the big animals with big plants.
Right on.
And within five years, hunger will be a thing of the past.
And that's what you're doing it for, is it, Jack?
For the benefit of all the hungry people throughout the world.
Especially the children.
Oh, God, you're going to make me cry.
Hey, Lorna, you surprise me.
I always thought you were like me.
Anything for a buck.
Oh, no, you underestimate yourself, baby.
Nobody could be a whore like you.
You're number one.
I heard that argument you had with Bensington.
Are you that much concerned?
No?
Well, why'd you throw away your job?
I couldn't take the chance the rats would get me before I told Bensington exactly what I thought of him.
You okay?
I think I'm going to be sick again.
Get up. Come on.
It's all my fault.
Her pregnancy or her being out here?
Both.
Well, it's too late to do anything about either, isn't it?
Oh, God, help us.
I won't never sin again, never.
Only don't let no rats eat us.
Please, God.
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
Come on, baby.
Choke this thing, here.
There you go.
Take the shotgun, Brian.
You know something,
I'm supposed to be in Chicago, day after tomorrow.
Yeah, I know.
Think I'll make it?
I sure hope so.
Oh, Jesus, here they come.
Don't shoot.
What if it doesn't stop them?
We won!
Morgan, we won!
All right, let's get out of here. Come on.
Okay.
You were right!
They can't swim!
Let's go.
If I was a fish, I'd have thought it was too easy.
What's the matter?
Did you count how many rats there were back there at the water?
- Just now?
- Yeah.
No, I didn't count them.
Yeah, well, if you had, you'd find out that there's only half the bastards we left back there at that generator.
So what?
So, I think the rest are up to something else.
Like what?
Like, we better find out damn quick.
Where the hell are you going?
Come on, Morgan, let's break this down.
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, God.
Brian!
Brian!
Morgan!
Morgan!
If you care for that girl in there with your baby, you better change your mind.
Once I leave here, none of you are going to get out alive.
I couldn't take Rita back out there with those rats.
There's no way.
You just didn't see them like we did.
Now, you listen to me, you get that pregnant girl of yours out of here and into that car.
And don't give me any bullshit.
And the old lady goes, too.
Well, get them, god damn it!
Yeah, that's right, Jack.
You be sure and take
Mrs. Skinner with you.
You'll need her signature for the rights, won't you?
What happened to your friend?
He run out on you?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, come on.
Hey, let go of me, you son of a bitch
Hey, hey! No, stop it!
Please, stop it!
Stop, no!
No!
Oh, Lord!
Look! Look, look!
Get the shotgun!
Mr. Thomas.
Thomas!
Listen, everything's going to be okay.
Better go in the bedroom with Rita.
She's not feeling too well.
Looks like the white one's the leader.
Save your energy, Thomas.
They're out of shotgun range.
Hey, we scared them off.
Yeah, for a while anyway.
For a while? We can hold them off forever, man.
Just cool it, will you?
Mr. Morgan!
Mr. Morgan, the well's run dry.
I been pumping and pumping since the Lord knows when.
Yeah, well, you can stop pumping.
Those rats have cut through the pipe right to the well.
What do we do about water?
That's the least of our problems.
Those rats will be in here long before we ever get too thirsty.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Morgan, how do we know we can't reach them with our shotguns out there?
Boy, just another 20 feet closer, we'd get them all.
Hey, you're ruining those shells!
Yeah, I know. But that's all we got left to save us.
Hey, look, Thomas, count the shells we've got.
If we're lucky enough to knock out one rat with each shell, there'd still be enough of those bastards left to hold a hell of a people barbecue.
Oh, you've got an answer for everything, don't you?
Well, maybe we shouldn't have listened to you, maybe Bensington was right.
Yeah, you got a point there.
Well, nothing gets to you, god damn it!
We could've been the hell away from here if it wasn't for you.
I'll tell you what. Bensington's car is still out there.
You can take it if you want to.
I'm sure he won't mind.
I know all about delivering babies.
Living on a farm, you get to know those things.
Everything's going to be all right.
- Lorna.
- Yeah.
Can you handle one of these.
Sure.
You ever shot one?
No.
Oh, terrific.
Well, it's ready to go.
Hold it tight against your shoulder. It kicks, okay?
Yeah.
God, I know my husband isn't coming back to me. I know it, I know it.
Was the finest man in the whole world.
Is it possible that
Bensington was right?
We could have driven through them?
Yeah, it's possible.
How can you be so cool?
Aren't you afraid?
Sure, but I'm more bothered that those rats are out there trying to outsmart me.
If I told you how I felt right now, you'd think I was crazy.
Tell me.
I want you to make love to me.
It is crazy, isn't it?
At a time like this.
Listen, the first thing we'll do when we get back to the mainland is continue this conversation, okay?
But that's just it, I don't think we'll ever get back.
They're attacking again.
I need more shells.
How's it going?
I've been lying here, thinking about what it's going to be like when those rats get inside.
Morgan says we're gonna be fine.
Do you believe that?
You know, I used to think about dying a lot.
I'd sort of lie there in bed, at night, in the dark.
I guess I've always had a terrible fear of it.
Rita, don't.
I used to fantasize the most horrible death.
You know, the most frightening.
None of them come close to being eaten by rats.
The funny thing is, now that it's happening, it really doesn't seem to matter, except for my baby.
What do you think our chances are?
Pretty good.
Like hell.
Have it your way.
Any minute now those rats are going to bust in here, and you're still fussing around with some lousy jars.
Well, it's something to do.
Something to do?
That, my dear boy, is what life is all about.
From the time you're born, it's finding something to do while you're waiting to die, and you try like hell to prevent it.
I'm not afraid to die,
'cause it means
I'll be with my husband again.
I'm not afraid.
Not afraid.
Now, you get your ass in gear and get over there, and put that strip in that gasoline jar and move it!
I think we ought to at least talk about it. All of us.
Yeah, about what?
Bensington's car.
It's still out there, and the rats haven't hurt it.
I'll tell you what, we'll take a vote on it.
- Good. If we...
- After we come back.
From where?
Say, I'm not going to leave Rita, if that's what you're thinking.
Pick up those jars of gasoline, Thomas!
You're going to kill us.
Now open the front door!
Oh, God.
God!
No!
Oh, no!
I think the baby means it this time.
How did you know there was a dam?
Mrs. Skinner told me.
Don't let the baby die , please.
Can you see?
Can you see the head?
Push.
Is the head coming?
It's showing its head.
Yeah?
Yeah. Now, push.
Push.
Okay.
Is it a boy? What is it?
It's a boy.
It's a boy? It's a boy.
Jesus. We'll never get...
We won't by sitting here.
Come on.
Light this thing.
Everybody upstairs, now!
Morgan!
Oh, God, no!
Well, I guess that's the end of them.
The end of Bensington's one last big shot at immortality.
We were able to get Thomas's camper fixed long enough to get us back to the ferry and away from that nightmare for good.
I'm back with the team, and things won't be the same without Brian and Davis.
My father was right.
The land rebelled much worse than he ever could have imagined.
Nature was attacked, and hit back with a vengeance.
I hope we got it all, and the Food of the Gods has gone back to wherever it came from.
I hate to think what would happen if even a trace of that stuff is left.
If it got into the watering ponds or into the irrigation ditches.
Did we get it all?
Because if we didn't...

SOLARIS
Part One
Kris, come here!
You're just in time.
He takes a walk every morning for at least an hour.
I forbade him to come back earlier.
He's had a lot of work, sometimes staying up all night.
These Solarists!
He reminds me of a bookkeeper, preparing his accounts.
We expected you yesterday.
He wanted to run away when he saw me.
Hello.
Hello.
I probably shouldn't have bothered you today.
How old you and I have become.
I've only just realized that.
What are you apologizing for?
Does he understand that everything depends on his first report from the station?
Everything we've received so far has been confusing or incomprehensible.
If he confirms that the work can't continue for some reason, the station can be taken out of Solaris' orbit.
He understands.
You promised to talk to him.
I brought the film.
That's what I came here for.
- Yes, of course.
Can the boy stay with you for a few days?
I have a lot to do and no one to leave him with.
Anna will look after him.
She'll have more free time now.
When does he leave?
He'll be gone by tomorrow morning.
It's so pleasant here.
This house reminds me of my grandfather's house.
I really liked it.
So we decided to build one just like it.
I don't like innovation.
I'd better get going.
I have a lot to do.
Don't you want to see this?
I've already seen it many times.
On the 21st day of our expedition,
radio-biologist Vishyakov and physicist Fekhner
went on an exploratory flight over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane.
When they failed to return after
16 hours, we declared an emergency.
The fog was thick and we were forced to call the search off.
All of the rescue craft returned to the station
except for the helicopter operated by Burton.
Burton returned an hour after dark.
Once out of the helicopter, he ran to his quarters.
He was in a state of shock.
This was highly unusual
for a man with 11 years of experience flying in space.
He recovered in a couple of days,
but he would never leave the station
and refused to approach the window overlooking the Ocean.
Later he wrote to us from the clinic.
He was preparing a statement of great importance,
one that would decide the fate of Solaristics.
Excellent.
Let's hear what he has to say.
At this time, let us give the floor to Burton.
Thank you.
When I first descended below 300 meters,
I had trouble maintaining altitude.
There was a strong wind.
All of my attention went towards operating the ship.
I did not look out of the cabin.
As a result, I wound up in a fog.
- Was it an ordinary fog?
Of course not.
It seemed to be colloidal and viscous.
It coated all of the windows.
Because of the fog's resistance,
I began to lose altitude.
I couldn't see the sun,
but the fog glowed red in its direction.
After half an hour
I came out into a large, open space.
It was almost round, a few hundred meters across.
At that point,
I noticed a change in the Ocean.
The waves disappeared.
The surface became almost transparent, with clouded patches.
Yellow sludge gathered beneath it.
It rose up in thin strips and sparkled like glass.
Then it began to seethe, boil and harden.
It looked like molasses.
This sludge or slime gathered into large lumps
and slowly formed different shapes.
I was being drawn into the fog,
so I had to struggle against this for some time.
When I looked down again,
I saw a sort of garden.
A garden?
Attention, please.
I saw shrubs, hedges, acacia trees, little paths.
Everything was made of the same substance.
Did these trees and plants have leaves?
These shrubs and acacias?
No, I already said they were all made of plaster, but life-sized.
Then everything began to crack and break.
Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures.
Everything began to boil even harder, and foam appeared.
You can see for yourselves.
I used a camera from time to time.
Everything I saw before and after should be on film.
Then I propose we interrupt these discussions
and see everything with our own eyes.
All right, show us your film.
This is very interesting.
Is that it?
That's all of your film?
Yes, that's everything.
But we don't understand.
You filmed clouds.
Why did you film clouds?
That must be the fog
I told you about.
I wasn't expecting this.
All of this could be the result of Solaris' bio-magnetic current
acting on Burton's consciousness.
We now know the current is not only a gigantic cerebral system,
but a substance capable of thought processes.
That hypothesis is questionable.
Were you feeling sick that day?
The next part is meaningless.
Let's pick up here.
I discovered something floating in one of the openings.
It looked like Fechner's space suit.
Its shape was that of a person.
I turned around-
I didn't want to lose sight of that spot.
At that moment, the figure rose slightly,
as if it were swimming or treading the waves.
This person had no space suit, and he was moving.
I don't understand. "Person"?
Yes, person.
Just a minute.
Did you see his face?
Yes.
What person?
Who was it?
It was a child.
What child?
Had you seen him before?
No, never.
In any case, not that I remember.
When I flew closer to him,
I noticed something awful.
What do you mean?
I couldn't make it out at first.
Then I saw that he was unusually large. Gigantic.
He was about four meters tall.
He had blue eyes
and dark hair.
Perhaps you're not feeling well?
We'll postpone the meeting.
I'll continue.
He was naked, absolutely naked,
like a newborn.
He was wet, or rather, slippery.
His skin was shiny.
He rose and fell like the waves, but he was moving by himself.
It was disgusting.
I'm sorry.
I'll jump ahead a little.
There isn't much more.
Burton's statements appear to be the result of a hallucinatory complex
brought on by the planet's atmosphere,
as well as symptoms of depression
exacerbated by inflammation of the associative zone
of the cerebral cortex.
This report in no way, or in almost no way,
corresponds with reality.
What do you mean "almost"?
Excuse me, I'm not finished yet.
Professor Messenger offers a different opinion.
He believes that Burton's statements could be founded in reality
and merit further study.
That's it.
I saw it all with my own eyes.
I would like to offer another opinion.
We stand on the brink of an enormous discovery,
Our decision should not rely on the observations
of a man without any scientific qualifications.
Although any researcher may envy this pilot,
his presence of mind, his gift of observation.
Moreover, in light of recent information,
we are morally obligated to continue the exploration.
I can understand how Professor Messenger feels.
I understand him.
But let's take a look at the road we've traveled.
Solaristics is exactly where it began.
Years of work have been in vain.
Everything we now know about Solaris is negative
and has come to resemble a mountain of disjointed, incoherent facts
that strain credulity.
We're in exactly the same situation today.
Solaristics is degenerating.
But what we're talking about is far more serious
than just the study of Solaristics.
We're talking about the boundaries of human knowledge.
Don't you think that by establishing artificial barriers
we deliver a blow to the idea of limitless thought?
By limiting our movement forward, we facilitate moving backwards.
I nevertheless repeat my question.
What do you mean by saying
the report of my observations in almost no way corresponds with reality?
I saw everything with my own eyes.
What do you mean by "almost"?
"Almost no way" means that some real phenomena
could have triggered your hallucinations, Burton.
When it's windy,
it's easy to confuse a swaying bush with a living being,
to say nothing of a foreign planet.
I meant no offense, Burton.
None.
I'd like to know what impact
Professor Messenger's opinion will have.
Practically none,
which means that exploration in this area will be discontinued.
Just a moment. Yes...
I'd like to make a statement.
The commission has not offended me,
but it has offended the spirit of the expedition.
Therefore, I consider it my duty to announce...
And so on...
Nowadays it's considered good manners to laugh when Burton's report is mentioned.
Thank you, Burton.
We've known you for a long time, but I never knew anything about you.
You know, you were very handsome.
That's not true, but thanks anyway.
Excuse me.
Well, Kris, what do you think?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak to your son alone.
I don't want to look like an idiot in front of you yet again.
I'll wait for you outside by the swing.
What a ridiculous man.
You have no reason to say that.
He's ill at ease.
He thinks he's getting in the way of our farewell.
He's a tactful man.
If he decided to come, it's because he considers this important.
Although, I admit,
I'd rather not see anyone now.
You and I rarely get a chance to talk.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Even if it's on the last day.
The last day.
One always feels awful after a big farewell.
Here comes your aunt.
Let's meet after lunch.
We need to talk.
Why did you have to invite this Burton today of all days?
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Next to you, or in the room upstairs?
Upstairs, I guess.
Well, I'm off to my meeting by the swing.
- Maybe...
- Just a moment.
You and your rooms can wait!
Listen, Kris...
What happened?
- What's standing over there?
- What are you afraid of?
In the garage, staring at me.
It's a horse.
Don't. I've seen it already.
Come on.
He's gentle.
Look how beautiful he is.
You understand, I think
Solaristics has reached an impasse as a result of irresponsible daydreaming.
I'm interested in the truth, but you want to turn me into a biased supporter.
I don't have the right to make decisions based on impulses of the heart.
I'm not a poet.
I have a concrete goal:
Either stop the research and remove the station from orbit, thereby legitimizing the Solaristics crisis, or take extreme measures.
Perhaps bombard the Ocean with heavy radiation.
- Not that!
- Why not?
Didn't you say research should continue at any price?
You want to destroy that which we are presently incapable of understanding?
Forgive me, but I am not an advocate of knowledge at any price.
Knowledge is only valid when it's based on morality.
Man is the one who renders science moral or immoral.
Remember Hiroshima.
Then don't make science immoral.
It's strange...
Strange.
There's nothing strange about it.
You yourself can't be sure that what you saw wasn't just hallucinations.
Thank you very much.
It's seems there's nothing more to discuss.
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
He's an accountant, not a scientist.
You were right.
You and I are friends, but that doesn't mean you can say that about him.
Great. You and I have known each other for 20 years. It had to end someday.
Are you leaving the boy?
What did you have to offend him for?
You're too harsh.
It's dangerous to send people like you into space.
Everything there is too fragile.
Yes, fragile!
The Earth has somehow become adjusted to people like you, although at what sacrifice!
What, are you jealous that he'll be the one to bury me, and not you?
Thus, it had been established that the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain.
Right after that, an even more daring hypothesis came out,
suggesting that the Ocean is a thinking substance.
Incidentally, this hypothesis
still cannot be confirmed or refuted.
It's a program about Solaris.
There are few believers left.
First of all, there are those connected to the fate of the Solaris station.
On this huge station built to house 85 people
there is now a crew of three.
They are: astro-biologist Sartorius,
cyberneticist Snaut,
and physiologist Gibarian, who deal with the problem...
I'm calling from the city.
Burton.
Anna, leave for a minute.
We need to talk.
I didn't talk to Kris about what was most important:
about Messenger, who voiced a different opinion at that meeting.
He became very interested in Fechner, who died in the Solaris Ocean.
It turns out that Fechner has an orphaned son.
He had left his family.
Messenger and I paid a visit to Fechner's widow,
and I saw this boy with my own eyes.
You never told me about that.
I never got the chance.
Fine. Go on.
This child was identical to the one I saw on Solaris.
Of course, he wasn't four meters tall.
He shouldn't think about this too much before liftoff,
but he should keep it in mind.
There's no point in keeping these papers.
The ones to hold on to are in my room.
My research notes, my thesis...
I held on to so much.
If something should happen,
I'll find someone to take care of them.
I'll come up with something.
Don't look for that film.
I'm taking it with me.
Remember?
The one of the bonfire?
Yes, of course.
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready, Moddard.
Don't worry about a thing.
Have a great trip.
Send our regards.
- When is liftoff?
- You're already flying, Kris! Take care.
Solaris station! Do something!
I'm losing stability.
This is Kelvin, over.
Hey, where is everyone?
You've got guests.
Dr. Snaut?
Snaut?
I'm Kelvin, the psychologist.
It looks like you weren't expecting me.
Did you receive the radiogram?
Yes, of course.
What's with you?
Forgive me.
Where's Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?
Sartorius is in his quarters.
Gibarian is dead.
What do you mean "dead"?
Suicide.
I beg your pardon.
I knew Gibarian and he would never have...
He was almost always in a state of deep depression ever since these disturbances began...
Why don't you go rest, take a bath?
Take any room and come back in an hour.
I would like to see Gibarian -
I mean, Sartorius.
Later.
I doubt he'd see you now.
He's upstairs, in the laboratory.
Listen, Snaut,
I understand that something extraordinary has happened and maybe...
Dr. Kelvin...
You understand...
Come back in an hour. Please.
Go and rest.
Listen, there are only three of us: you, me and Sartorius.
You know us from our photographs.
If you see something out of the ordinary, something besides me and Sartorius, try not to lose your head.
What would I see?
I don't know.
That sort of depends on you.
Hallucinations?
No. Just remember.
- Remember what?
- That we're not on Earth.
You know, it would be better if you came back in the evening, or at night.
No, let's make it tomorrow morning.
A. GIBARIAN
HUMAN BEING
FOR K. KELVIN
Hi, Kris.
I still have a little time left.
There are some things
I must tell you,
and some things
I must warn you about.
By now you're at the station and know what happened to me.
If not, Snaut or Sartorius will tell you.
What happened to me...
is not important.
Or rather, it cannot be explained.
I'm afraid that what happened to me is only the beginning.
I wouldn't, of course, want it to happen...
but this could happen to you and the others.
Here, it could probably happen to anyone.
Just don't think that I've lost my mind.
I'm of sound mind, Kris.
Believe me.
After all, you know me.
If I have enough time,
I'll tell you why I did everything.
I'm telling you this so that, if it does happen to you,
you'll know it's not madness.
That's the most important thing.
As for continuing research,
I'm leaning towards
Sartorius' proposal,
subjecting the Ocean's plasma to heavy radiation.
I know it's prohibited, but there's no other choice.
We...
You will get mired in it.
It may offer a way of breaking this deadlock.
This is our only chance to make contact with this monster.
There is no other choice, Kris.
If...
Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin.
I arrived two hours ago.
Listen, this is ridiculous.
Either open up or I'll break down the door.
All right, I'll open the door, but don't come in.
I'll come out.
- Fine.
My name is Kelvin.
Go on.
You must have heard of me.
I work, or worked, with Gibarian.
Go on.
Snaut told me about Gibarian.
Then you already know the story.
Yes, it's horrible.
I don't know the details, but he's dead.
That's not the problem.
We all die.
But he insisted on being buried on Earth.
Is space really such a bad grave for him?
But Gibarian wanted to be in the ground, with the worms.
I wanted to disregard it, but Snaut insisted.
- Have you ever heard of Burton?
- He was the pilot who...
Yes, he was in the search party for Fechner.
Fechner died a magnificent death, but Gibarian was a coward.
There's no point talking badly of him now.
It's at least worth talking about duty.
Duty to whom?
- To truth.
- You mean to people.
You won't find truth there. Look.
Your position is absurd.
Your so-called courage is inhuman!
You hear me?
Go away.
You're too impressionable.
You must get used to everything.
Good day.
I spoke to Sartorius.
He's a rotten person.
He's a very talented scientist.
I think I'm a little sick.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just won't take advice.
Snaut, aside from the three of us, is there anyone else on the station?
Did you see someone?
What were you warning me about?
Whom did you see?
Was it a human being?
Is she real?
Can she be touched? Wounded?
You saw her today.
And you?
Who the hell are you?
Quiet.
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone.
You're afraid.
Don't worry.
I won't think you're insane.
Insane?
God, you know absolutely nothing!
Insane...
That would be a blessing.
Listen, Snaut...
It's all so senseless.
They won't understand me.
They think I've gone crazy.
Do you see, Kris, how it's not entirely absurd?
I have to do this because
I'm afraid they'll come in here.
I mean Snaut and Sartorius.
They themselves don't understand what they're doing.
I'm afraid, Kris...
I can't...
Nobody will be able to understand.
Open up! You hear, Gibarian?
Open up!
Don't be stupid.
It's just us - Snaut and Sartorius.
We want to help you.
They want to help me.
Just a second. Quit knocking.
I am my own judge.
Have you seen her?
Kris, understand that this is not madness.
It has something to do with conscience.
I really wanted you to get here in time, Kris.
Where did you?
It's so nice.
But... but it's not...
How did you know where I?
What do you mean, "how"?
Don't, Kris. That tickles.
Where are my shoes?
- Shoes?
No. They're not there.
Who's this?
Kris... it's me.
You know...
I have the feeling... as if I've forgotten something.
I can't understand it.
Do you love me?
Don't be silly, Hari.
As if you didn't know.
I'm going out for a moment.
Wait for me, okay?
- I'll go with you.
- No, Hari. I'll be back soon.
No.
What's with you? Why?
I don't know. I can't.
You can't what?
It feels like I...
I have to see you... all the time.
What are you, a child?
I have work to do, Hari.
I'm behaving foolishly.
And so are you.
Running around all disheveled, like Snaut.
- Like who?
- Like Snaut.
Listen, how do you...
Well, I have to go.
If you want, we can go together.
But you won't be able to get into a suit with your dress on.
Get undressed.
Kris, help me. I can't undo it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
SOLARIS
Part Two
Get in.
- What about you?
- I'm right behind you.
I have to shut the hatch.
Is everything all right?
Are you comfortable?
Yes. Hurry, Kris.
You could at least knock.
It sounded like you were talking to someone.
All the more reason.
So you had guests?
Well, I see you took good care of them.
It's nothing.
You won't die from it.
Did you at least start out modestly?
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?
If you plan to clown around, you might as well leave.
Sometimes you become a clown without wanting to.
Don't tell me you haven't tried a rope or a hammer.
Did you happen to throw the inkwell like Luther? No?
So, one, two, and into the rocket, and that was that.
Next time, don't panic.
And push the button from the corridor.
You could get burned.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Then again, we've managed to determine a few things.
Who was it?
She died 10 years ago.
What you saw was the materialization of your conception of her.
What was her name?
- Hari.
Everything began after we started experimenting with radiation.
We hit the Ocean's surface with strong X-ray beams.
But it...
Incidentally, consider yourself lucky.
After all, she's a part of your past.
What if it had been something you had never seen before, but something you had thought or imagined?
I don't understand.
Evidently the Ocean responded to our heavy radiation with something else.
It probed our minds and extracted something like islands of memory.
Will she come back?
She will... and she won't.
- Hari the Second.
- There may be an endless number of them.
Why didn't you warn me?
You wouldn't have believed me.
I got scared and acted not entirely...
Don't be hard on yourself.
We've had enough of Gibarian.
There's talk about liquidating the station.
That's why I was sent here.
If I submit a report, will you sign it?
And what if we suddenly make that long-awaited contact?
Night is the best time here.
It somehow reminds me of Earth.
Attach strips of paper to the air-vents.
At night it sounds like the rustling of leaves.
It was Gibarian's invention.
So simple, like all genius.
I adopted it right away.
Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room.
He hides it in the closet.
You should rest.
If you can, come to the library later.
I've prepared a list of books for you.
Snaut, is that you?
Kris, where are you?
Come here.
- It's so dark.
- Come here. Don't be afraid.
Hari!
The door opens the other way.
Hang on.
I'll be right back.
When I saw you weren't there,
I got scared.
Hello, Kris.
I can barely hear you.
Speak louder.
What are you doing right now?
Nothing.
Sartorius has invited us to his laboratory.
How are you?
Fine. I'll try to make it.
Kris, what's wrong with me?
Maybe it's epilepsy?
This is my wife.
Hello.
Hello.
- We've been waiting for you.
- I was busy.
- How lovely! Are these yours?
- No, they're Snaut's.
So, as far as I can tell, they are constructed...
Let's just call them "guests."
Fine.
While our structure is made of atoms, theirs consists of neutrinos.
But neutrino systems are unstable.
They seem to be stabilized by Solaris' force field.
You've got a superb specimen.
That's my wife.
Wonderful. Perfect.
Then take a blood sample from your wife.
Why?
It'll sober you up a bit.
What do you think?
- Snaut?
- Enough of all of you!
I burned the blood with acid, but it's restoring itself.
Regeneration?
In essence, immortality-
Faust's problem.
Excuse me.
There's no need for cotton.
Are you qualified to perform an autopsy?
I've already told you -she's my wife.
Don't you understand?
I think these experiments are more humane than testing on rabbits.
Don't you agree?
It doesn't matter.
It would be like cutting my own leg off.
Did you feel pain when you broke through the door?
Pain? Of course.
So if I ever catch you doing anything...
- You're lucky.
- How so?
It's meaningless, yet you've managed to establish emotional contact with them.
It may be pleasant...
- What are you, jealous?
Maybe I'm jealous.
No, you're not jealous.
After all, you're not guilty of anything.
- Of course.
- But I am guilty.
Of what?
When you turn into an utter cripple with no arms or legs, call us.
We'll empty your chamber pot.
- But whom have you wronged?
- You, among others.
My father shot that.
Well, I shot a bit.
Listen...
I don't know myself at all.
I don't remember.
When I close my eyes,
I can't recall my face. And you?
What?
- Do you know yourself?
- Like all humans.
That woman in the white coat hated me.
Don't make things up.
She died before you and I met.
I don't understand why you're deceiving me.
I remember perfectly.
We drank tea and she kicked me out.
Naturally, I stood up and left.
I remember perfectly.
What happened after that?
After that, I went away, and we never saw each other again.
Where did you go?
To a different city.
- Why?
- I was transferred.
Why did you leave without me?
You didn't want to come.
That I remember.
Forgive me.
I thought you were already awake.
What happened?
The regeneration is slowing down.
For two or three hours we can be free of them.
You came in the middle of the night to tell me that?
I'll tell you why I came.
Sartorius and I were thinking:
If the Ocean derives guests from us while we dream, maybe it makes sense to transmit our waking thoughts to it.
- How?
- With beams of radiation.
Perhaps it will understand and spare us from all these apparitions.
Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons about the greatness of science?
We'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us.
And "one of us" means me, of course.
An encephalogram!
A transcription of all my thoughts!
What if I suddenly want her to die?
To disappear!
Entrust everything to that... that mass of jelly?
It's already invaded my soul.
Kris, we're running out of time.
Sartorius has proposed another project: the annihilator.
Self-destruction of the neutrino systems.
What is this? Blackmail?
I convinced him to start with the encephalogram.
But forget about this for now.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Consider yourself invited.
- Liar! You just want to make up with us.
- Yes, I do.
Don't shout. She sleeping.
Sleeping?
She's already learned how to sleep?
This will all end badly.
- Well, what do you propose I do?
- Nothing.
So you'll come?
Tomorrow, in the library.
We'll set the table.
At least there are no windows in there.
In the meantime, let's go.
Sartorius is waiting.
She's sleeping.
Will she follow me?
Don't lock the door.
What door?
It's just an apparition.
Wait. I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Forgive me.
Why aren't you asleep?
- You don't love me.
- Stop it, Hari.
- We have to talk.
- About what?
You understand that I don't know where I came from.
Maybe you know?
- What's with you?
Stop. Don't interrupt.
If you know, but you can't tell me now, perhaps one day you will.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand a thing, honestly.
You don't want to tell me.
You're afraid.
Then I'll tell you.
I'm not Hari.
Hari is dead.
She poisoned herself.
I'm somebody else.
Who told you this?
- Sartorius just told me.
- Last night.
It would have been better if you had told me yourself.
My God, what's the difference?
How have you lived all this time?
Were you in love with anyone?
I don't know.
Did you ever think of me?
Yes, but not all the time.
Only when I felt unhappy.
You know, it feels like somebody is tricking us.
And the longer this fog lasts, the worse it will be for you in the end.
Particularly for you, Kris.
How can I help you?
Tell me.
And her, the other one, what happened to her?
We argued.
Towards the end, we argued a lot.
I gathered my things and left.
She made me understand without saying it directly, but when you live with someone for a long time, such things aren't necessary.
I was sure they were just words, but then I remembered that I'd left the laboratory specimens in the refrigerator.
I had brought them from the laboratory and explained how they worked.
I got scared.
I wanted to go to her.
But then I thought it would look like
I had taken her words seriously.
After three days, I couldn't take it anymore and I went to see her.
When I got there, she was already dead.
There was a needle mark on her arm.
Like this?
Why did she do it?
She probably sensed that I didn't really love her.
But now I do.
- Kris.
- What?
I love you.
Get some sleep.
I don't know how to sleep.
It's not sleep.
It's somehow around me.
It's as if it weren't just inside of me, but much farther away.
It's probably still sleep.
So, it looks like our guest of honor isn't showing up.
- Why?
- Maybe he has guests.
Oh, everyone's already here?
You're an hour and a half late.
What's that you're reading?
It's all rubbish.
Rubbish.
Where the hell is...
Here!
"They come at night.
But one must sleep sometime."
That's the problem.
Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.
You'd better read.
I'm a little excited.
"I know only one thing, señor.
When I...
When I sleep, I know no fear, no hope, no trouble, no bliss.
Blessings on him who invented sleep.
The common coin that purchases all things, the balance that levels shepherd and king, fool and wise man.
There is only one bad thing about sound sleep.
They say it closely resembles death."
"Never before, Sancho, have I heard you speak so elegantly as now."
That's great, but perhaps you'll let me say something now?
I propose a toast to Snaut, to his bravery, to his devotion to duty.
To science and to Snaut.
Science? Nonsense.
In this situation, mediocrity and genius are equally useless.
We have no interest in conquering any cosmos.
We want to extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos.
We don't know what to do with other worlds.
We don't need other worlds.
We need a mirror.
We struggle for contact, but we'll never find it.
We're in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal that he fears, that he has no need for.
Man needs man.
Let's drink to Gibarian.
To his memory.
Even though he got frightened.
No, Gibarian was not frightened.
There are worse things.
He died of hopelessness.
He thought all this was happening only to him.
My God!
All these heartbreaking lamentations are nothing but second-rate Dostoyevsky.
Who are you to judge?
I know why I'm here.
I'm working.
Man was created by nature so he could learn her ways.
In his endless search for the truth, man is condemned to knowledge.
Everything else is whim.
Permit me to ask, my esteemed colleague:
Why have you come to Solaris?
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, are you working a lot?
Forgive me, but aside from the romance with your ex-wife, nothing seems to interest you.
You spend all day lounging in a bed of noble thoughts, and that's how you carry out your duty.
You've lost touch with reality.
Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer.
Enough!
Let's try to be pleasant.
We'll drink to Gibarian.
Not to Gibarian, but to Man.
Are you saying
Gibarian was not a man?
Stop it, Kris.
Let's not fight.
After all, it's my birthday.
It's my day.
Of course.
I think that Kris Kelvin is more consistent than both of you.
In inhuman conditions, he has behaved humanely.
And you act as if none of this concerns you, and consider your guests - it seems that's what you call us - something external, a hindrance.
But it's a part of you.
It's your conscience.
And Kris loves me.
Maybe it's not me he loves, but he's simply protecting himself.
He wants me alive.
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter why man loves.
It's different for everyone.
It's not Kris.
It's you.
I hate you all.
- I would ask you...
Please don't interrupt me.
I'm a woman, after all.
You're not a woman and you're not a human being.
Understand that, if you're capable of understanding anything.
There is no Hari. She's dead.
You're just a reproduction, a mechanical reproduction.
A copy. A matrix.
Yes.
Maybe.
But I...
I am becoming a human being.
I can feel just as deeply as you.
Believe me.
I can already get by without him.
I... love him.
I am a human being.
You... you're very cruel.
Get up! Get up right now!
My dear man.
Nothing could be easier.
We've wasted time arguing.
We're losing our dignity and human character.
No.
You're human, each in your own way.
That's why you argue.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
You're a good man... but you look awful.
I've really lost heart.
Help me out a bit.
Doesn't a man who's ready to give up his life just to make cursed contact in order to know more about it have the right to get drunk?
He has every right.
Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin?
I'm not going to bed yet.
It's important not to fall asleep.
I'm going to see Faust.
In the laboratory, our Faust-
Sartorius - is seeking a remedy for immortality.
While we...
Listen, let's open these hatches and shout down below.
It would suddenly hear.
But what should we call it?
Maybe we should whip it.
Or, better yet, pray to it.
What's wrong?
I think I shut the door to the library.
She's there alone.
Go. I feel better already.
The station is changing its orbit.
At 5 a.m. there will be
30 seconds of weightlessness.
Don't forget.
Forgive me, my darling.
I was lost in thought.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Everything's fine.
She drank liquid oxygen.
She did it out of despair.
It'll get worse.
The more she's with you, the more human she'll become.
Learn from Sartorius' example.
- Thanks for the advice.
What do you intend to do?
Wait until she returns.
And then what?
Leave the station?
Kris, she can only live here, on the station. You know that.
What can I do?
I love her.
- Which one?
Her, or the one in the rocket?
You can pull her in from space.
She will appear again and she'll keep appearing.
Don't turn a scientific problem into a common love story.
I had a feeling this would end badly.
You should help her.
What a ghastly sight.
I can never get used to all these resurrections.
Is it me?
Hari...
What?
Why?
Why?
No, it's not me.
It's... I'm... not Hari...
And you... Maybe you...
- Don't, Hari.
- I'm not Hari!
Fine!
Maybe your appearance is supposed to be torture.
Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean.
What does it matter when you're worth more to me than any science could ever be?
Do I look a lot like her?
No, you looked like her.
But now you -and not her- are the real Hari.
Tell me...
Do I disgust you? I'm so...
I disgust you!
- No, Hari. That's not true.
- You're lying!
- It's not true. Stop it.
- I must be disgusting!
- Stop it.
Don't touch me!
I love you.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm not going back to Earth.
I'll live here with you on the station.
You know...
I'm afraid.
It looks like it's showing some activity.
Your encephalogram helped.
You know... whenever we show pity, we ravage ourselves.
Maybe it's true...
Suffering makes life seem dismal and suspect.
But I won't accept that.
No, I won't accept that.
Is that which is indispensable to life also harmful to it?
No, it's not harmful.
Of course it's not harmful.
Remember Tolstoy?
His suffering over the impossibility of loving mankind as a whole?
How much time has passed since then?
Somehow I can't figure it out.
Help me.
See, I love you.
But love is a feeling we can experience but never explain.
One can explain the concept.
You love that which you can lose:
Yourself, a woman, a homeland.
Until today, love was simply unattainable to mankind, to the Earth.
Do you understand me, Snaut?
There are so few of us.
A few billion altogether. A handful!
Maybe we're here in order to experience people as a reason for love.
He seems to have a fever.
How did Gibarian die?
You still haven't told me.
I'll tell you. Later.
Gibarian didn't die of fear.
He died of shame.
Shame-the feeling that will save mankind.
Mama, I...
I'm two hours late.
I know.
How was your trip?
Fine. I'm a little tired, but it was fine.
My God, it's running slow again.
I'll go adjust it.
You've got plenty of time.
You know, it's really embarrassing, but for some reason...
I've completely forgotten your face.
You don't look well.
Are you happy?
Somehow that concept seems irrelevant here.
That's really a pity.
I'm very lonesome now.
Why do you hurt our feelings?
What have you been waiting for?
Why haven't you called?
You're leading some sort of strange life.
You're filthy and unkempt.
How did you make such a mess of yourself?
What's this?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
How are you?
Everything all right?
Where's Hari?
What's that?
There's no more Hari.
"Kris, it's terrible that I had to deceive you, but there was no other way.
This is best for both of us.
I asked them myself.
You mustn't blame anyone.
Hari."
She did it for you.
Snaut, listen.
Later, Kris. Calm down.
How... how did it...
The annihilator?
A burst of light and wind.
Yes.
Things weren't working out between us towards the end.
Listen, Snaut.
Why are we being tortured like this?
In my opinion, we have lost our sense of the cosmic.
The ancients understood it perfectly.
They never would have asked why or what for.
Remember the myth of Sisyphus.
Since we transmitted your encephalogram, none of the guests have come back.
Something incomprehensible is starting to take place in the Ocean.
Islands have begun to form on the surface.
First one. Then the next day there were several more.
Are you trying to tell me that it understood us?
That quickly?
But at least there's hope, eh, Kris?
- How old are you?
- Fifty-two. Why?
Have you been here long?
- You must have seen my forms.
- I did.
Listen, having spent so many years here on the station, do you still feel a clear connection to your life down there?
You like dire questions.
Soon you'll ask me about the meaning of life.
Wait. Don't be ironic.
It's a banal question.
When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him.
These questions should be asked at the end of one's life.
But we don't know when life will end.
That's why we're in such a hurry.
Don't rush.
The happiest people are those who are not interested in these cursed questions.
To ask is always the desire to know.
Yet the preservation of simple human truths requires mystery.
The mysteries of happiness, death and love.
Maybe you're right, but try not to think about all that now.
To think about it is to know the day of one's death.
Not knowing that day makes us practically immortal.
Fine, then.
In any event, my mission is finished.
But what next?
Return to Earth?
Little by little, everything will return to normal.
I'll even find new interests and acquaintances.
But I won't be able to give myself to them fully.
Never.
Do I have the right to turn down
even an imagined possibility of contact with this Ocean
which my race has been trying to understand for decades?
Should I remain here?
Among things and objects we both touched?
Which still bear the memory of our breath?
What for?
In the hope that she'll return?
But I don't harbor this hope.
The only thing left for me
is to wait.
I don't know what for.
New miracles?
Are you tired?
No, I feel great.
You know, Kris...
I think it's time you returned to Earth.
You think so?
THE END
- Everything's on for tonight?
- Yes.
- I still think it's too soon to bring him up.
- We have no choice. They're onto us.
I've programmed the CLC for two hours.
There's no telling when it'll be free again.
We'll have to move him if he comes up, or be ready to dispose of him the usual way.
Please state registration code.
Check.
Where was the subject found?
We came across it the last day of our field trip into the woods a week ago.
The capsule was perfectly intact.
- Is there any date on the capsule?
- Yes. The subject was frozen in 1973.
He's been under for 200 years.
- Blood pressure?
- Encephalo-activity?
- Just under normal.
General life functions: Acceptable.
- He should come out of it any moment.
- Do we have any information on him?
Just the usual data card inside the capsule and the personal artefacts kit.
Subject was 35 years old at time of initial cryogenic immersion.
His name: Miles Monroe.
He was part-owner of the
Happy Carrot Health-Food Restaurant on Bleecker Street, wherever that was.
Also a clarinet player with something called the Ragtime Rascals.
Was his immersion voluntary?
"Subject entered hospital for routine exploration of minor peptic ulcer, and complications set in.
Patient never regained consciousness."
"He was admitted for immersion by his cousin, a Mrs Joan Needlebaum."
- The physical damage was repaired?
- Totally. Routine.
- We're getting an initial motor response.
- This is the critical stage.
If his regaining consciousness isn't handled carefully, there could be damage.
We're dealing with an involuntary subject who expects to be waking up in
St Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village in 1973.
Swallow reflex is almost there.
- We've got to get him out of here.
- He's not ready.
We've got to get him ambulatory, ready or not.
Careful.
Now, just keep him on his feet.
We've gotta dispose of this capsule.
Get him to the farm.
- We'll meet there tonight.
- Yes.
Now, let's try to take a step.
Like this. One...
- Bend the knee. Up, down.
- Take a step. That's it.
There you are. Good.
Very good, Mr Monroe.
Up, down...
Oh, no. He's got it in reverse.
- You're going wrong.
- Mr Monroe.
Security's coming.
Mr Monroe? Please, Mr Monroe. Wake up.
We've gotta get him dressed - quickly.
Stand, right there. Stand.
That's it.
Mr Monroe, there we are.
Sorry to bother you, Doctor.
Is everything OK?
Yes, we...
We ought to be through here shortly.
It's funny. We're getting a misread on the power function.
Really? Well, I'll order a check first thing in the morning.
Any reason why anyone else would be consuming power?
No, it's just Dr Orva,
Dr Monroe and myself.
We definitely did register a power increase here.
Don't mind Dr Monroe.
He's not over the effects of a new ray we've been experimenting with.
- What's this?
- That?
- I think you two'd better come with us.
- Why? We haven't done anything.
I think I can explain. You've heard of the Venus Project, haven't you?
Yes.
We had to come in this evening to finish up some very important work.
When we asked for clearance, we were given no reason to believe we couldn't...
- You have authorisation?
- We had clearance given.
- Fully, a week ago. Don't you believe...?
- Dr Monroe, I... Gentlemen...
- This really is getting difficult.
- He could be dangerous.
Please leave us alone so that we can complete our work.
He's going to get dizzy.
This is going to be worse than ever.
- Don't you see what a difficult...
- This is getting a little out of hand.
If we hadn't had this interruption, we'd have had it under control.
- Now, please, gentlemen.
- Are you sure you have authorisation?
He's fully recovered... except for a few minor kinks.
- Has he asked for anything special?
- Yes. This morning for breakfast.
He requested something called wheat germ, organic honey and tiger's milk.
Those are the charmed substances once felt to contain life-preserving properties.
You mean there was no deep fat?
No steak or cream pies or hot fudge?
Those were thought to be unhealthy... the opposite of what we now know to be true.
Incredible.
Well, he wants to know where he is and what's going on.
I think it's time to tell him.
I can't believe this.
My doctor said I'd be up and on my feet in five days.
He was off by 199 years.
I know it's hard, Miles, but try to think of this as a miracle of science.
To me, a miracle is I go in for a minor operation,
I come out the next day, my rent isn't 2,000 months overdue.
That's a miracle of science.
This is what I call a cosmic screwing.
And where am I, anyhow? What happened to everybody? Where are all my friends?
Understand that everyone you knew in the past has been dead nearly 200 years.
But they all ate organic rice.
You are now in the year 2173.
This is the central parallel of the American Federation.
This district is what you'd probably call the southwestern United States.
That was before it was destroyed by the war.
- War?
- Yes. Over a hundred years ago, a man named Albert Shanker got a hold of a nuclear warhead.
You will remain in hiding here for two weeks while we run tests on you.
Then, when you've recovered your strength, we'll discuss the plan.
I still can't believe this.
What do you mean "hiding"? Who am I hiding from? What does she mean?
You might as well know, Miles, that reviving you as we did was in strict opposition to government policy.
What we've done is illegal.
If we get caught, we'll be destroyed... along with you.
What do you mean "destroyed"?
Your brain will be electronically simplified.
My brain?
It's my second-favourite organ.
Resisters to mind-reprogramming will be exterminated for the good of the state.
What kind of government you guys got?!
This is worse than California.
There is a growing underground, Miles.
Someday the revolution will come and we can overthrow our leader.
You gotta be kidding.
I wanna go back to sleep.
If I don't get at least 600 years,
I'm grouchy all day.
We're taking him along too fast.
He's still emotionally unstable.
I go in for a lousy ulcer operation,
I lay in a Birds Eye wrapper for 200 years,
I wake up, suddenly I'm on the ten-most-wanted list!
We'd better tranquillise him.
It was too good to be true.
I parked right near the hospital.
Here. Smoke this. Be sure you get the smoke deep into your lungs.
- I don't smoke.
- It's tobacco.
It's one of the healthiest things for you.
Now, go ahead.
You need all the strength you can get.
I bought Polaroid at seven.
It's probably up millions by now.
Now, we have certain artefacts here which we date from 1950 to 2000.
We'd like any information you can give us on them. Very little exists.
For instance...
Joseph Stalin. He was a communist.
I was not too crazy about him.
He had a bad moustache, a lot of bad habits.
This is Bela Lugosi. He was the mayor of New York for a while.
You can see what it did to him there.
This is... This is...
Charles de Gaulle.
He was a very famous French chef.
Had his own television show. Showed you how to make souffl–πs and omelettes.
This is Scott Fitzgerald over here.
A very romantic writer.
Big with English majors, college girls, nymphomaniacs. Very, well...
This is Chiang Kai-shek, who I was not too crazy about either.
This is Billy Graham.
Very big in the religion business.
He knew God personally.
Got him his complete wardrobe.
Used to go out on double dates together.
It was a big thing.
They were romantically linked.
This is some girls burning a brassiere.
You notice it's a very small fire.
This, I don't know what that is.
That's a photograph of Norman Mailer, who was a great writer.
He donated his ego to the Harvard Medical School for study.
And this... this I can tell you already, this is a centrefold from a magazine we used to call "Playboy", which...
These girls didn't exist in actual life.
They were rubberised.
You had to blow 'em up.
And you could spread ointment on them, or anything else that you...
I'll just take this and study it later and give you a full report on it.
And would you tell me exactly... what this is?
Yes. This is...
You see, this is the chattering teeth.
This, you would buy at a store and take it to a party if you wanted to get big laughs.
You'd put it down on the coffee table and you'd set it off and then...
See how funny it is?
The teeth chatter. They're plastic.
I am going, at this time, to give to this television and radio audience...
Some of us have a theory that he might have been a president of the United States, but that he did something horrendous, so that all records, everything, was wiped out about him.
There is nothing in history books, there are no pictures on stamps...
Yes, he was president.
But whenever he left the White House, the
Secret Service counted the silverware.
Thank you very much, Jimmy.
From the beginning, Muhammad Ali's career was marred by controversy
and, who knows, it may have ended last Saturday in the very same way.
From the...
At first we didn't know what this was, but we've developed a theory.
We feel that when citizens in your society were guilty of a crime against the state, they were forced to watch this.
...the way it began - March of 1964.
That's where...
Yes, that's exactly what that was.
- Would you like some more?
- This tastes awful.
I could have made a fortune selling it.
Janis, some more for Mr Monroe.
Certainly, sir.
- Are you thirsty, Mr Monroe?
- Me? No. No, thank you.
Of course.
- These robots are uncanny.
- They're one of our biggest industries.
Far more sophisticated than previously manufactured labour-saving devices.
They're alert, they respond. I've gone out with girls with less movement than that.
Watch this. Janis, come here.
Yes, Dr Orva. May I be of service to you?
Tell us about yourself.
My name is Janis 414.
I'm a domestic service menial of the 400 Series.
I can cook, clean,
I am a butler, a gardener and chauffeur.
I have been programmed to respond to a complex series of domestic commands.
Janis, clear the table and then leave the room.
Come on, Miles.
Are there females?
The possibilities are limitless.
It's late. We've got to get you out of here.
- What do you mean? Where am I going?
- To the Western District.
The underground has its headquarters there.
Miles, have you ever taken a serious political stand on anything?
Yeah, sure. For 24 hours once
I refused to eat grapes.
There's something called the Aires
Project. We want to know what it is.
Why?
We believe it's a plot the leader has to destroy the revolutionary movement.
- How do I fit in?
- We defrosted your capsule because we needed someone with no identity.
Everyone here has a citizen's record.
We've all been computerised, catalogued, fingerprinted, voice-printed.
But you have no number.
You can be used to penetrate.
If you're captured, you don't know anything.
They could torture you for months.
What could you tell them?
My name, rank, serial number and your name.
- You've got to help us.
- You've got the wrong guy.
I'm not heroic.
I was beaten up by Quakers.
- Miles, you're our chance.
- No, I'm sorry.
I never get involved in anything where I could be tortured.
I'm a screamer. It's embarrassing. I wake up shrieking at the top of my lungs.
Excuse me, sir. The security police are here and they're surrounding the house.
- When will you want lunch?
- Go to the Western District.
- Find the Aires Project.
- You can do it.
Out that way, Miles.
Fly, goddamn it. Fly.
Goddamn cheap Japanese flying packs.
We still haven't located the alien.
We'd like to check the back of your van.
All right, come on. Let's go. Move it.
Let's go. I don't have all day.
Come on. Come on.
Here's your new home.
Oh, no. Is this the best they could offer?
Jeez. I'd hoped for something with at least decent features.
I guess I'll bring you in next week and have your head removed. OK, come on.
- What's your name?
- M-Milo.
The alien authorities are seeking is still at large.
Persons observing any unusual activity or behaviour
should do themselves and our leader a favour by reporting it to the police.
All right, Milo.
I'm expecting company any minute.
Help with the drinks and serve.
Some of them'll be hungry.
The kitchen is on a single-circuit system.
I think I'm going to put some rose oil on my fingertips.
Check the music channel and the aromatrom, and make sure there's plenty of food for all the people.
I think the way it was first explained to me...
Remember that very funny story...
Hi, everyone. Long time, no see.
Long time, no see. Come right on in.
Where did you get that? It's gorgeous.
- Hi!
- How are you, darling?
- It's wonderful. You shouldn't have.
- I just thought you'd like it.
Oh, it's Keane. It's pure Keane.
No. No, it's greater than Keane.
It's Cugat.
It was white on white.
And you know where she got it?
- No. You're kidding.
- Right. Right. You know who paid for it?
- Magnificent.
- Let's go and tell her about...
Here it is.
The orb.
Could I have a hit off that hot orb, Milo?
Milo, Milo.
No, no, no.
Let's all go for a swim.
Where's the pool?
Run, run, run!
That was wonderful. I feel so refreshed.
We should have had sex, but there weren't enough people.
- We'll use the orgasmatron.
- That's a good idea.
I think Beverley's nose looked larger tonight.
- I had such a good time.
- All in all, I thought the party went well.
As good as last night's or the night before's.
Maybe not quite as good as last Saturday's but, you know,
I love a party with a theme.
- Say, there's something on your mind.
- They arrested Dalton Porter today.
- Why?
- He was with the underground.
- No.
- It was horrible.
They tried to reprogramme him and it went wrong.
- He's a vegetable.
- I don't wanna hear this.
L- I saw it happen. He was babbling.
He claimed he saw secret experiments at the hospital.
Something called... Aires.
I absolutely do not wanna hear about it.
This world is so full of wonderful things.
What makes people go berserk and hate everything?
Why does there have to be an underground?
There's the orb, the telescreen, the orgasmatron. What more do they want?
It's hard for us to understand criminals.
We're artists. We respond only to beauty.
Yes, I know.
Herald... I wrote a new poem today.
- You didn't?
- Yes, I did.
A little boy caught a butterfly
And said to himself:
I must try to understand my life and help others,
Not just mothers and fathers
But friends. Strangers, too.
With eyes of blue and lips full red and round,
But the butterfly didn't make a sound
For he had turned into a caterpillar...
By and by.
That's deep.
You're so obviously influenced by McKuen.
- Do you really like it?
- Only one thing...
They change from caterpillars into butterflies. Not the other way.
They do? They do?
Damn it. Damn it.
Damn it. I always get that wrong.
- Relax. Relax.
- Oh, shoot. Shoot.
Oh, no. Now the whole evening's spoiled.
And now I'm getting a headache.
Shoot. I hate to be wrong!
Luna, sit down, sit down.
Luna, sit down. Come on. Sit down.
- It'll be all right, I promise. Now just relax.
- I was having so much fun.
Come on... That's better.
And now Channel 1200 leaves the air until tomorrow morning.
Our leader wishes you all a pleasant good night.
- Can I help you?
- Would you change his head for me?
- Something a little more aesthetic.
- Right.
And check his works. He acts peculiar.
Got room in there for another head change?
Yeah, sure.
- All right, I'll be back in a little while.
- Let's go.
You have to help me. I'll tell the truth.
I'm not a puppet. I'm Miles Monroe.
I was frozen in 1973.
Doctors thawed me out.
Everybody's after me, but I didn't do anything. I'm a nice person.
I would never force myself sexually on a blind person.
You're the alien?
You live in a police state. We have to find out what the Aires Project is.
- God, you are. You're the alien!
- You won't give me away, will you?
I knew I could count on you.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a cracker, maybe?
Take a cracker.
How can you not be hungry?
We've been sitting here for hours.
All you had in the car were these... interstellar space cookies.
Eat something. You'll feel better.
Just take a cracker.
Will you shut up? For God's sakes, put yourself in my position.
I'm a clarinet player in 1973.
I go into the hospital for a lousy operation.
I wake up 200 years later and I'm Flash Gordon. Plus I'm a criminal.
I never did anything wrong. I ran a health-food store in Greenwich Village.
Occasionally a customer would get botulism.
But that was very rare.
Now, look, you have to help me.
You're the only person I know.
I'm gonna take that gag off.
If you're gonna scream, scream.
Nobody's gonna hear you.
Go ahead, scream.
I love it, I love it. Scream.
Help! Help me!
Shut up or I'll bring this rock down on your head so hard that a substance resembling guacamole will come out of your ears.
- What do you want with me?
- Help me reach the underground.
I'm not helping any alien.
We don't want your crazy ideas.
Go back to Greenberg's Village.
Greenwich Village.
Not Greenberg's Village.
And that was 200 years ago.
I can't go back.
You're sick. You have to give yourself up.
They won't hurt you.
They'll restructure your brain.
Oh, no. Nobody touches my brain.
They may drop it.
Then I'd talk like I'd been hit by lightning.
Please! I wanna go home.
I'm getting a headache. I'm hungry.
I haven't had a stress pill or a bath in seven hours.
I'm not accustomed to this. I need my orb.
I wanna relax. Look at me.
Look at me. I'm shaking.
- You'd be great on a camping trip.
- I order you to take me home.
They'll be out looking for me.
You've abducted a very important person.
I am a renowned poet. I sell 20 to 30 poems a week, plus greeting cards.
- How far is the Western District?
- It'd take days, and that's with a vehicle.
Take me there and you'll never see me again, I promise.
I'm hungry. I can't think straight.
Obviously, I'll promise you anything.
If I get you some food, will you take me to the Western District?
You sit here. I'll find us something.
And don't try anything funny, cos you know what you'll get.
What?
What?
What will you get?
A large and painful hickey.
Oh, my God. I beat a man insensible with a strawberry.
That's a big chicken.
What a way to go, to be pecked to death.
Pass the celery.
- There you go.
- Couldn't you get anything else?
Do you think it's easy to run when you're holding a banana the size of a canoe?
You didn't get any dessert.
There's no seasoning, no wine.
I still can't believe the size of these.
I'd hate to see the fertiliser.
What was that?
- What?
- That noise. Didn't you hear anything?
Are there any strange animals that I should know about here?
Anything futuristic, like with the body of a crab and the head of a social worker?
How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police?
How do I know?
Cos I think, maybe, what the hell.
I think maybe you trust me a bit now.
Maybe you think I got you food and, what the hell, I'm not really such a bad guy.
OK. Now, we're gonna get a vehicle.
And don't try anything funny or you'll be sorry. Come on.
Our car broke down.
Is it possible we could borrow one?
Sure. Come on in. Are you OK?
Fine.
My goodness gracious. Just look at yourself. You're so dishevelled.
I might have some clothes you could just jump right into.
Why don't you just come this way?
- Her car ran out of...
- What, honey?
We have to borrow a car.
- What are you mumbling about?
- Could I use your bathroom?
Yes, of course.
Come on in and sit down.
Come on in here and you just sit right down here, you little cutie.
Hello, police? I can't speak.
I'm with the alien.
We're heading west on the 1600 channel.
We should be at the eastern parallel in a half an hour.
- Detain him somehow. We'll be right out.
- OK, I'll try.
But I'm not gonna promise anything.
Don't let him out of your sight.
We're on our way.
- Would you like a stroke?
- Me? No, thanks, man. I'm cool.
Excuse me.
Do you have a space hydrovac suit?
Of course. Why?
Are you going on the space shuttle?
Yes.
Yes, I am. And he forgot his.
Reagan. Bring out my hydrovac suit.
Right this minute.
Here's your silly old hydrovac suit.
Jesus, I could hardly find it.
It's such a mess in that bedroom.
What am I gonna do with a hydrovac suit?
If you don't want the police to recognise you, take off that robot uniform.
- What is a hydrovac suit?
- It's for space travel. Use it as a disguise.
I see you're starting to think a little bit now.
- Why are we stopping by the river?
- I don't know. I think that we're lost.
Hey, look.
Over there.
- No. Over there.
- Shall we take her in or get rid of her?
- I'm not the one that you want.
- Take her in for reprogramming.
- What are you talking about?
- You've been contaminated by the alien.
- What?
- You spent too much time with him.
- But I'm the one who turned him in.
- Let's get rid of her now.
- One less reprogramming job.
- She'll be fine after the brain treatment.
Help!
Our orders were to use our discretion.
I say destroy her.
- We're gonna have to swim for it.
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean, you can't swim?
- I mean I can't swim.
I can't swim either. Get on top of me.
- Come on, get on top of me.
- I don't wanna get wet.
- Hurry up. Paddle.
- I'm paddling.
Don't worry.
I was a lifeguard at Bloomingdale.
How could you? I hate you. I hate you.
Try not to get upset.
They wanna destroy me. Me!
The inflater.
Lean left. Left.
No. Lean left.
Use the inflater.
- What is it?
- It's a 200-year-old Volkswagen.
They really built these things.
Reg... "Register commies, not guns."
What's that mean?
- What?
- "Register commies, not guns."
He was probably in the National Rifle Association.
There was a group that helped criminals get guns so they could shoot citizens.
- It was a public service.
- Let me see that.
It's a "New York Times" - be careful - from 1990.
"Pope's wife gives birth to twins." Wow.
- We don't have cities like New York now.
- No cities at all?
No. But I went to the university at a population centre.
You went to a university?
It's hard to believe. For what?
Cosmetic sexual technique and poetry.
They teach you sex in school?
Yes, in case something goes wrong with the machine.
What do you do? Switch to manual?
Where did you learn about sex?
From my mother. When I was little, I asked her "Where do babies come from?"
She thought I said rabies.
She said "From a dog bite."
A lady on the block gave birth to triplets.
I thought she was bitten by a Great Dane.
That's perfect. We'll dump it in the water.
They'll never find it.
What's it feel like to be dead for 200 years?
It's like spending a weekend in Beverly Hills.
Hey, don't bother to help. It's a light car.
Were you scared? Do you believe in God?
Do I believe in God?
I'm what you would call a teleological existential atheist.
I believe there's an intelligence to the universe, except for parts of New Jersey.
Why is it I never understand what you're saying?
Why? Do you believe in God?
Well, I believe that there's somebody out there who watches over us.
- Unfortunately, it's the government.
- Miles.
Miles, did you ever realise that "god" spelt backwards is "dog"?
- Yeah. So?
- It makes you think.
Yeah.
Do you wanna push the car, please?
Push the car, will you?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
All right, let's go!
- Nice work.
- Just my luck. It landed on a turtle.
Hey, I know this place.
This is where they first brought me.
- It looks deserted.
- Boy, we really have gone wrong.
Hey... Hey, look at this.
I wonder who their decorator is.
- What's the matter?
- I heard something.
- It's probably futuristic mice.
- I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of.
You're with me.
I did that. What...
For God's sakes, get a grip on yourself.
You need a drink.
Come on. Try.
- Who are you?
- Me?
Get off my channel.
What are you doing?
Who is that guy?
I couldn't make enough money playing jazz, so I had to open up the health-food place.
- Weren't you any good?
- Yeah, I was all right but
I always felt that to really play jazz, you had to be black.
- I'm just a mulatto.
- You?
Yeah. You knew that about me, didn't you?
- No.
- Yeah, I am.
- You're joking.
- I wouldn't kid about that.
My father was black and my mother was white and vice versa.
Come on, Miles. You "are" joking.
I'm always joking. You know that.
It's a defence mechanism.
Do you wanna perform sex with me?
Perform sex?
I'm not up to a performance, but I'll rehearse with you if you like.
OK. I just thought you might want to.
There have a machine here.
Machine? I'm not getting into that thing.
I'm strictly a hand operator.
I don't like anything with moving parts that are not my own.
It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200 years.
204, if you count my marriage.
- What did your wife do?
- She was a hit man for the Mafia.
- Was... Was she beautiful?
- Yeah, she was great.
Blonde hair, great upturned nose.
It was really dynamite. Two blue eyes... one on either side, of course.
I liked the arrangement.
That's why I married her.
- See, you are. You're teasing me again.
- No.
Yes. You think I'm stupid.
No. How can you say that?
I think that you're bright and... and sensitive and...
Beautiful. Yeah. Well, then, how come you're not attracted to me?
You know, I mean, men go crazy over me.
I'm great physically.
I got a PhD in oral sex.
- They make you take Spanish with that?
- What?
I don't know. I was an English major.
Chaucer. Pope.
I minored in foreplay.
It's a two-credit course at NYU...
Miles. You're not taking me seriously.
What do you want me to say if you say
"Do you wanna perform sex with me?"
It's so cold. I need to be warmed up and sent flowers, romanced.
Sex is different today. You see?
We don't have any problems.
Everybody's frigid.
That's incredible. Are the men impotent?
Yeah. Most of 'em, except for the ones whose ancestors are Italian.
Right.
I knew there was something in that pasta.
You wanna get in the machine now?
No. We don't need that. Really, I...
I think it would be great if we did.
I wouldn't be frigid...
You wouldn't be frigid with me.
Nobody ever is.
I got the magic fingers.
You know, I swear.
I've cured more women of frigidity.
It's my specialty.
Two minutes in bed with me and you'll sell that thing for scrap iron.
I got a lot of fast moves. Really.
The only thing is, I have asthma, so if you hear some wheezing, it's me.
But give me a decent burial and...
This is the police.
We have the premises surrounded.
Come out with your hands up...
Hide in this room. I'll lead them away.
Contact the underground.
Find out what the Aires Project is.
Remember that?
- Yes. The Jupiter Project.
- Aires.
The Aires Project. What about you?
Don't worry about me, honey. I'm like a cat. I'll always wind up on my feet.
Mr Monroe? I'm Dr Nero, your orientation advisor.
I'm here to supervise the initial phase of your assimilation into society, a society that will take care of your needs and desires with great efficiency.
Now, you get a good rest and next week you'll begin a new life.
- Subject prepared for a total brainwash.

Our Miss America contest is down to the five finalists.
Miss Alabama, Miss Florida,
Miss California,
Miss Hawaii and Miss Montana.
Now, in order to test the contestants' personalities, we're going to ask each a question.
Miss Montana, if you could do anything for mankind, what would it be?
- He's not responding.
- Go up half a cycle.
I would use my title to bring peace to all nations of the world, be it black, be they white, be it coloured, be it whatever.
And now for that moment you've been waiting for.
First, we're going to give you
Miss Personality and Miss Congenial.
Miss Florida and Miss Hawaii.
And the second runner-up is...
Miss California.
Finally, the first runner-up, who will take over first place if the winner is unable to fulfil the duties and obligations that go with winning.
The first runner-up... Miss Alabama.
Which means that the winner is...
Miss Montana.
Anybody here?
I have a new citizen to be outfitted.
You want jackets, we got jackets.
You want trousers, we got trousers.
This is a good time, believe me.
We're having a big sale. Tremendous.
Positively the lowest prices.
Maybe you need a nice double-knit?
- I'm stuck with three-pieces corduroy.
- Something simple.
We got simple, we got complicated.
Why do you worry?
- Who put that shipment downstairs?
- Why d'you bother me? I got a customer.
You know what you're doin'?
That was all velvet.
So it's velvet.
Leave me alone. I got a customer.
- Why do we need so much velvet?
- What?
- Where do we come to velvet?
- I'll talk to you later.
I'm in a bit of a rush here, if it's OK.
You know what your mistakes are costing us?
Drop dead. You wanna drop dead?
OK, step against the screen.
- This is terrible.
- OK, OK. We'll take it in.
You'll work at the function complex.
It's a required service of all citizens.
This is where you'll be living.
It's a gift from our leader.
Isn't this pretty?
I think you're really gonna like it here.
That's your orientation pamphlet.
It has the names of all your new friends.
There will be conversation and discussion assemblies twice a week.
After you've moved into your permanent home, you'll enjoy mechanised servants.
Until then, you can have a computerised dog. Rags!
Woof, woof, woof.
Hello, I'm Rags. Woof...
Is he house-broken or will he leave batteries all over the floor?
Don't yell. We're with the underground.
Once this week
I questioned my supervisor and I missed a couple of minutes of our leader's speech on television.
And you know that blonde girl,
Rainer, who works in my office with me?
She's got... With the long blonde hair and the... great tomatoes.
We've been sneaking into the projection room on our lunch hour and making love.
I know if they catch us, it's against the rules, but I can't help it.
I'm... And I hope that you forgive me.
Hello, Miles.
- Who are you?
- Who am I? I'm Luna.
- Who?
- Luna.
Don't you remember?
We were outlaws, aliens.
The police captured you. I escaped.
I'm with the underground.
Remember? The Western District?
Miles, I'm Luna.
Luna! Remember? Luna.
- Your name is not Luna, is it?
- Think back, Miles.
1973. The Happy Carrot Health-Food
Store? The Ragtime Rascals?
- You're the alien.
- That's right, Miles. I've come for you.
How did you get in here?
Don't come near me. Rags!
- Miles.
- Rags, get in here. Come on, boy.
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- Come on, Rags!
- Get her! Go for her throat, Rags.
- Woof, woof, woof, woof.
We're going to reprogramme your mind.
We're going to free it.
- Rags, get her. Come on, Rags. Kill.
- Woof, woof, woof.
Go ahead. Goddamn dog.
Hello, I'm Rags. Woof, woof, woof.
We have a good file on him.
We'll induce a hypnotic state and force him to re-experience some of the major traumas of his life.
Hopefully, this'll shatter his recent personality and allow the old one to emerge again.
My orb, my...
You won't need that any more, Miles.
Now, listen to me, Miles.
It's the year 1962.
It's time for that Sunday dinner at your parents' house.
Your parents' house in Brooklyn on K Avenue.
No.
What are you standing there?
Come in. Your food is getting cold.
- Let's eat.
- Miles, take some peas.
The Passover holidays are coming and you'll be wanting to wear your matzos.
I've got something to tell you.
Arlene and I have to get a divorce.
She thinks I'm a pervert because I drank our waterbed.
Oi vai iz mirl
Oi, gevaldl. What will them "goyims" say?
No.
Stop whining and eat your "shikseh".
Oh, no.
No, please. Don't let in the light.
Cover those lights, please.
Please, don't get up.
I was just passing through.
Erno. Erno, what's happening?
Something's gone wrong with the treatment.
His brain is elsewhere.
He believes he's another person.
- No, no. I need magic.
- Miles. Miles. Who are you, Miles?
I'm Blanche... Blanche Dubois.
It means white wood.
- We can't upset him or it could be fatal.
- What are we gonna do?
You read "A Streetcar Named Desire".
Just play along. He needs an injection.
Physical beauty is passing, a transitory possession.
But beauty of the mind and richness of the spirit and tenderness of the heart -
- and I have all those things -
- aren't taken away, but grow, increase, with the years.
Strange that I should be called a destitute woman when I have all these riches locked in my heart.
I been onto you from the start.
I seen how you tried to sprinkle this place up with them powders and those fancy French colognes.
Well, I say ha!
You hear me? Ha! Ha!
I think... I... Yeah.
Why, you're not the gentleman that
I was expecting. What's going on?
Whoever you are, I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.
- How you feelin', Miles?
- You look beautiful.
You were screaming out names in your sleep.
Oh. I was having sexual nightmares.
Who are the A&P Gypsies?
- You look so different.
- I feel different, Miles.
I've spent the past six months living like a wild animal.
- Really?
- That's right. All of us.
All of us in the underground. We all live on our cunning and our instinct.
- We're all a pack of wild animals.
- Lunch, Luna.
While you were being a pawn in capitalistic society,
Erno's been teaching me the beauty of Karl Marx.
- Who's been teaching you?
- Erno.
You absolutely must meet him.
He's wonderful.
In a few months he's going to lead the revolution and start a Marxist regime.
Government by the workers and the downtrodden masses.
- You remind me of Lisa Sorenson.
- Who?
An old girlfriend of mine.
A Trotskyite Jesus freak, arrested for selling pornographic dot-to-dot books.
Miles, I wrote a song about the revolution.
There's not gonna be any revolution unless we stop the Aires Project.
Don't you worry about that.
Just relax. Listen.
Rebels are we
Born to be free
Just like the fish in the sea!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that you were... kissing.
Miles. I was just telling Erno about Aires Day. He has a plan, Miles.
You tell him, Erno.
Right, darling.
- This is a one-channel radio.
- W-What, darling?
This... This is a phoney thumbprint.
It'll allow her to pass through the security scanning device.
We're gonna steal operating gowns and pose as doctors to get inside.
OK, try not to appear nervous. Smile.
- Peasants.
- Relax. You're shaking like a leaf.
- How do you want me to shake?
- Everything'll be fine.
- So how come you're shaking?
- You're making me nervous.
Don't blame me.
- Hello.
- Will you get a grip on yourself?
You'd probably feel safer with Mr White Teeth back there.
- Who?
- The rebel with the wall-to-wall muscles.
- You mean Erno?
- Yeah.
It's a great name if you're the star of a vampire movie.
- He's brilliant.
- I know. He couldn't be with us today.
- He's gotta take his handsome lesson.
- You're jealous.
Are you kiddin'? With a body like mine, you don't get jealous.
Don't expect me to tie myself to one man.
My love is a free gift to all the Bolshevik brothers.
Do what you want. You're over 21.
- Little tramp.
- We're here on business.
Free love. I created a Bohemian monster.
Next she'll want group sex with the robots.
Shut up. You're attracting attention.
Give her a book and she's
Miss pseudo-intellectual, neofascist,
- Hegelian Freudian monster.
- Don't get hysterical.
Get your part right. Don't worry about me.
- If we get screwed up, it's cos of you.
- "If we get screwed up, it's cos of you."
I'm on a mission with a retarded man.
- Just get your part right.
- You get your part right.
What am I doing here? I'm 237 years old.
I should be collecting social security.
Do you remember the diagram? There's fast forward, dual control, overheat...
- OK. We've been over all this.
- I know. But I wanna be sure you got it.
I'm the guy goin' out the window. It's a long drop. I'm liable to bruise my smock.
All right, Miles. Don't worry. I got it.
- This is the manual.
- No, that's the rewind.
- Then this is the manual.
- No, that's the dual control.
- I thought you said you had it.
- I do. I have it, I have it.
You love Erno?
Oh, Miles. I don't know.
All right, the coast is clear.
Start lowering me.
This is... manual.
No, that's fast forward.
Miles.
Look, I... I got some tape around.
For a minute I thought you couldn't work the machine.
- Erno said to take the north escalator.
- I'm running this. We're going "my" way.
It's Erno's plan.
He knows what he's talking about.
Why does he know? Cos he's handsome?
He's got capped teeth. Did you know? He has capped teeth. He's got capped gums.
- He is an architect and a mathematician.
- Yeah. But can he do this?
- You're an idiot.
- We're going my way.
Fine.
Dr Temkin, there you are.
Come with us. The meeting's this way.
Doctor.
- We're doctors. We're not impostors.
- Dr Temkin, could we please?
Big doctor. Very big.
Eyes, ears, nose and throat.
Please. May we? May we, Doctor, please?
- Nice work.
- They think we're someone else.
I know. If we'd followed
Erno's instructions, everything'd be OK.
I don't wanna hear about Erno.
That's the only thing that makes me st-stutter.
It's always Erno.
I'm tired of Erno. No more Erno.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- All right.
Gentlemen, none of you have ever met before for obvious reasons of security.
But now Aires Day is here.
I realise what I'm about to say will come as a great shock.
However, I'm counting on you to respond appropriately.
Ten months ago our leader suffered a horrible accident
when a bomb, planted in his home by the underground, exploded.
Naturally it was kept quiet,
but since then we have virtually been a leaderless society.
Unfortunately, preparations for a successor have never been clear.
In short, we have been in the throes of a major crisis.
As for our leader,
the emergency department rushed to the scene of the accident immediately,
but all that remained of him was this.
This is our leader's nose.
Using great presence of mind,
we rushed the nose to our closest delta laboratory, which is here,
where, through massive biochemical effort,
it has been kept alive for nearly a year.
Our dream has been that by cloning
we would reduplicate the entire leader again.
Cloning, for those of you unfamiliar with biology,
is a process by which, using one single cell,
a duplicate of the person it came from could be formed.
Till now, we've only had limited experimental success,
but all efforts have been directed to cloning over the past ten months.
And now we feel confident we can reproduce our leader from his nose.
Gentlemen, with God's help, in a couple of hours, we will have our leader back.
And we will then coordinate
Aires Phase Two,
which will exterminate all dissident factions on signal from our reborn leader.
- Miles, it's a nose.
- I know. I was here.
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll radio Erno. It's time to strike.
The leader has a terrific handicap.
He has no head or body.
- We're not fully prepared.
- It doesn't matter. They're in chaos.
- OK. Gimme the radio.
- I dropped it.
- You dropped it?
- It fell out of my pocket...
- Fell out of your pocket...
- Stop repeating what I say.
- Stop repeating...
- Get a grip on yourself.
- We gotta stop 'em.
- The only way is to steal the nose.
- How?
- I don't know. I never stole an organ.
- Wait a minute. I got an idea.
- Yeah.
The nose is in the operating chamber.
We go to the floor below.
Cut a hole in the ceiling, big enough to slide through.
Come up under the nose and hide it under my coat.
- It's a stupid plan.
- What's wrong?
It's too subtle. We have no time for that.
We go into the operating room.
You create a diversion. I steal the nose.
- Miles, I'm scared.
- Easy. You took some skin there.
- Here.
- What is that? A table lighter?
You gave it to me from Melik's before they captured you.
Where you been hiding it? Don't tell me.
The trick in these situations is to remain cool.
- You're biting my nails.
- Cos you're tense.
We're here to see the nose.
I heard it was running.
Dr Temkin, we're ready on this end.
You don't mind if some younger people not involved in genetic programming observe?
No, not at all.
I like to be watched while I clone.
The more the merrier.
I never... I never clone alone.
Hello, Dr Temkin. So nice to see you.
I'm Bio Central Computer 2100, Series G.
I'll be assisting you through the entire process.
May I say, we're all aware of your reputation
and we look forward to a successful cloning procedure.
- This is my assistant, D-D-Dr Spock.
- Janice.
- Dr Janice. Dr Spock. Spanis.
- Dr Spanice. Dr Smanice. Slock. Smock.
- Dr Slanice.
- Doctor.
I better have a look at the patient.
He's in a lot worse shape than I thought.
Better lay off Armenian women.
You can see the coded medical history on read-out four.
I believe that this is going to be a very difficult croning job.
- Yes. Cloning, you idiot, not croning.
- Cloning.
We are ready to proceed.
After looking at the nose,
I get the feeling what we oughta do perhaps is postpone the cloning.
Excuse me, Doctor, but that would be a tragic mistake.
I think the computer is failing to take into account what I call the Pinocchio factor.
It states that the square root of the proboscis equals the sum of the sinuses over seven.
What is "your" opinion, Doctor?
Should we proceed or postpone?
Indeed.
One moment. A moment.
A medical moment.
Yes. Well...
I believe that we should go ahead with the cloning.
Go ahead with...
I have to have a conference with the doctor for a second...
I just wanna speak to you...
- What do you mean?
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know how to clone a nose.
- You're crazy. I'm sick of this.
I'm sick of this. You make me crazy.
- Doctor, would you please proceed?
- You stop it!
Get a grip on yourself.
Of course. I'm glad you put it to me in that fashion.
Now, if you'll let me have the lobster fork.
Thank you very much.
What you have here...
I've diagnosed the situation.
I think what we're dealing with is a nose.
I think we're all in agreeance on that.
I have the little beggar right here.
And what you want is a whole, entire person connected to that nose, right?
Otherwise you get your money back.
Now, did you want me to leave room for a moustache?
There's a nice area there. It'll... It's...
What?
She's clever. The doctor's placing down the garments cos we're gonna make an attempt to clone the patient directly into his suit.
That way, he'll be dressed at the end of the operation.
It's a first in cloning, and we can all get the hell outta here.
No need to hang around while he suits up.
I think it's time to check the cell structure.
Yes. Checking the cell structure.
Checking the cell structure.
- Ah, checking the cell structure.
- Checking the cell structure.
Structure of cells to be checked.
- Checking the cell structure.
- Checking the cells.
Checking cell structure.
Checking the cell structure.
And now the cell structure has been checked. Thank you so much.
Now I'll just take my mask, if you don't mind, and I'll strap it on to my face.
And...
If you'll excuse me for one second while
I give the patient a quick... nostrilectomy.
This is it. Keep your fingers crossed.
Something's going wrong. There's been a current break in the life-support system.
- What I think we should do...
- What's that under your mask?
Pardon me? Under my mask?
Nothing. Why?
Is... Does it look excessively bulbous?
- He's got the nose.
- He's got the nose under his mask.
Right. Nobody move or I shoot your president.
Come on. We're getting outta here.
Don't come near me, or he gets it right between the eyes.
He'll do it. He'll do it.
I've seen him shoot a nose.
Please. Please, be careful.
You don't realise you're dealing with one of the greatest minds you've seen.
- Yeah. And his isn't so bad either.
- Yeah.
Don't come near us.
Get outta here now.
He's bluffing. He wouldn't shoot the nose.
Bluffing, am I?
OK, clowns. You asked for it.
I can't believe it.
We actually did it.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and a nose for a nose.
Whatever it means, it sounds brilliant.
You were absolutely wonderful.
Just think. Erno's plan worked.
What do you mean, Erno's plan?
What was I through all of that?
- What do you mean? It was Erno's plan.
- Look, I cannot discuss Erno with you.
I'm getting a hostility ache, and a migraine headache now.
I haven't seen my analyst in 200 years.
He was a strict Freudian and if I'd been going all this time,
I'd almost be cured by now.
Miles. Erno's going to lead the revolution and head the new government.
Don't you understand? In six months, we'll be stealing Erno's nose.
Political solutions don't work.
It doesn't matter who's up there.
They're all terrible...
- What are you looking at me like that for?
- I think you really love me.
Of course I love you.
This is what this is all about.
And you love me. I know that.
And I don't blame you, honey.
And I'm not knocking Erno.
He's great if you happen to like a tall, blond, Prussian, Nordic, Aryan, Nazi type.
But, Miles, meaningful relationships between men and women don't last.
That was proven by science. You see, there's a chemical in our bodies that makes us get on each other's nerves sooner or later.
That's science. I don't believe in science.
Science is an intellectual dead end.
It's a lot of guys in tweed suits, cutting up frogs on foundation grants and...
I see. You don't believe in science.
And you also don't believe that political systems work and you don't believe in God, huh?
- Right.
- So, then... what do you believe in?
Sex and death.
Two things that come once in a lifetime.
But at least after death you're not nauseous.
Sheriff.
Hi, little buddy.
Hey, what's happening?
Oh, nothin' much.
I thought I'd stop by and see if you had a scoop for the paper
Well, things are pretty quiet around here, Davy.
Oh?
Well, you know I always have things under control.
Well, I guess there's nothin' goin' on in this neck of the woods except the revival over in Gleason Town Hall
- You goin'?
- No. Are you?
No. I got me a date with Terry.
Well, I'm surprised that
Dan Kester would let you anywhere near her.
He's her brother-in-law, not her father.
Well, don't get on the wrong side of him, young fella.
He's a strange man and he's workin' up a big head of steam.
Dan?
Where the hell are you goin"?
In to town.
What the hell for?
Well, I'm goin' to a revival.
Well, you need it.
Git!
Sometimes, the only way
I know you're still alive is when I hear you flush the toilet.
- Hallelujah!
(in unison) Hallelujah!
The joy that you're feelin' right now is just the beginning.
Our revival is gonna grow and grow for the next four days.
Days that are gonna change your lives.
HI, Terry ready yet?
No, not quite.
You want a little drink?
Oh, no thanks, Mrs. Kester.
I'll just wait right here.
Well, you can call me
Ev, Dave.
Okay, Ev.
Sure you don't want one?
- No, uh, I'm sure.
Terry might be quite a while yet.
You know, you and Terry don't look much alike for sisters.
But I gotta say that good looks run in your family.
Well, thank you, Dave.
You know, it's too bad that there's this little age difference between us.
If you were five years older,
I'd jump ya.
Terry!
Hey, you look great.
Doesn't she, Mrs. Kester?
Yeah.
Come on, Terry.
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
I see. Uh, huh.
Disturbing the peace?
Yes, ma'am, that's an arrestable of fence.
No, the law does not apply to preaching.
Hellfire and brimstone, that is what is in store for you!
It's right here, Psalms 11.6,
"Upon the wicked, He shall reign fire and brimstone. "
Dutch? Dutch, this is Ev.
Listen, there's not a drop of booze left in this house.
I, I just can't stand it,
I'm really desperate.
Would you bring me something?
Oh, thanks, Dutch. Listen... listen, you'll find me very appreciative when you get here.
Okay, bye-bye-
Well, here we are.
You've got to be kidding!
You said park.
Come here.
Can you come again tomorrow night?
Well, I certainly hope so.
The revival will be still here.
Gimme that old time religion.
Boy, I can hardly wait to get saved again tomorrow night.
- Oh, Dan, wait.
- Huh?
You forgot your back braces.
Whoa, damn, it's good you remembered that.
Ooh, boy, if I went home without that on, there would be hell to pay.
"I saw a star fall from heaven onto the earth and there arose such a smoke out of the pit as a smoke from a great furnace.
And out of the smoke there came locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power. "
How was it?
Grr... eat.
What did the preacher... talk about?
Sin.
Yeah, what did he have to say about it?
He, uh, was against it.
Listen, damn it, you better tell me what that preacher said because I don't for a minute believe this rotten, stupid story of yours.
Look at that! Oh!
Aagh! Aah!
What the hell was that?
Weird.
Geez, would you listen to that wind.
Lights are dead.
What's wrong?
Car won't start either.
- Oh, great!
- Wait here, Terry.
Terry, come on!
Come on.
Oh!
What the goddamn hell was that?
It was a shooting star, maybe, huh?
Well, there's... there's nothin' there now.
No fire, no... no smoke, no smell, no sound, nothin.
Well, you saw it too. It wasn't just me, you saw it.
There must be somethin' out there.
Well, whatever it is, it can keep til mornin'.
You mean to say that all hell just busted loose in our field and you're goin' on in to bed?
I'm tired.
Well, you're always tired.
Well, that revival really took it out of me.
Now, if you want to, you can stay out here all night lookin' at nothing.
Our radar's on the fritz.
We are off our vector.
Hey, you know there's something screwy going on up here.
We're only 35 knots above our stalling speed, you better take a quick dive.
Still dropping.
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
Huh? I see.
You say your radio won't work.
Well, all I call tell you is call Joe's Radio Shop.
He opens at 9 a.m. sharp.
Your car won't start? Well, all I can tell you is call Ernie's Auto Repair, he opens at 8:00.
No, ma'am, I don't have the number.
All I can tell you is use the
Yellow Pages.
Let your fingers do the walking, ha,ha,ha“.
That's funny, I wonder why she hung up on me?
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Jesus, 'bout scared the death outta me.
Put the gun away.
- What the hell are ya doin' sneakin' in here at this hour?
I had to walk home.
I warned ya, that little Perkins snot is rotten.
It wasn't Dave's fault, h is car broke down.
Ha, you fell for that dumb old trick?
Ha, ha, that had whiskers on it when I was a kid. Ha!
It really did break down.
- Yeah, where?
- In the junkyard.
Hmm, that's just exactly where a horny little punk like that would park, in a junkyard.
I hate to burst your bubble, but it was my idea.
I oughta put you over my knee, and pull down your britches and spank the hell out of ya.
Oh! I always wondered why you used to spank me so much, so you could get your jollies.
Why you...
Man can't even have any peace in his own house.
Yes, this is Dr. Langer from
Montclair Observatory again.
I've got a gamma ray shower and the barometer's dropped an inch in less than 20 minutes.
That's unprecedented, right, fight
And none of the other phenomena
I'm reporting correlate with any previously observed date in this area.
Did I ever tell you you're gorgeous?
Not recently.
Paul, how many times do I have to tell you, you talk to plants to make them grow.
- Talk to plants?
- Right.
Not you, Vance. You haven't fallen for that metaphysical nonsense.
- Well, my M.O. says that I am half metaphysics and half astrophysics.
Now, what made you take the long walk down the hall?
More freaky stuff from northern
Wisconsin.
Freaky.
- We just got a report in that's right out of Ripley.
And what's the source?
Montclair Observatory and
Dr. J. Langer.
Langer?
For openers, "We have a heavy gamma ray shower, an incredibly fast drop in barometric pressure, an aurora with no sun activity and an amazingly potent unknown ground level x-ray source nearby. "
Paul, didn't we receive a SAC report on a fouled-up B52?
Yeah.
Was it in the same quadrant?
Oh, you're right.
It was... right here, then it disappeared off the radar scope.
Any report of a crash in that area?
No.
- What's the closest town?
Horton. You better pack your suitcase.
I'm wearin' it, old buddy.
Good, cause I've all ready arranged your transportation.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Seven o'clock already?
No, it's, uh, 6:02.
Well, what... oh, not you again.
Okay, what's up, Rider?
Well, we just got a report an oil freighter in the middle of Lake Superior.
Oh, that's beautiful. Did you check on the car fairies on Lake Michigan?
No, no, Vance, this is serious.
A couple of the seamen upon board the ship, saw a plane crash...
Oh?
- and it just might be ours.
Any sign of survivors?
- We don't know.
Okay, Dave, keep in touch.
Oh, uh, Rider... uh, what time am I supposed to meet this uh, uh... Langer at the observatory?
You're expected at 9:00 sharp.
Nine I can make, but if I don't get some shut-eye,
I ain't gonna be very sharp.
Bye,
Good-bye.
It's way past 7:00 already.
- So.
So, when the hell are you gonna get off your big, fat ass and go see what happened in our pasture last night?
Let me eat my breakfast in peace.
I gotta keep up my strength.
What for?
The more usual kinds of stars are what we astronomers call the "main sequence" stars and they run the gamut from the blue giants to the red dwarfs.
And then the more fascinating stars we call "abnormal" stars.
Then we have the white dwarfs and they have a radius of less that 1/100th of our sun's and a density so great that even a teaspoon of this matter would weigh tons and it could only be lifted by a giant crane.
Then there are the quasars, neutron stars and black holes or collapsed stars. Now, let me show you my conception of the creation of this universe.
Out of this primordial fireball, the galaxies, planets and stars of our universe were created.
As you can see, our sun is but one small star in a galaxy such as this.
Now, a galaxy consists of not only the stars that we talked about, but also great swirling masses of dust and gas out of which the stars were formed and to which they ultimately return. But now, let's go back to the collapsed stars or the neutron stars, quasars or black holes as we continue with this series, you'll learn many things about these various stars...
Hi.
- Hello.
I'm Dr. J. R. Vance from NASA.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here,
Doctor. I'm Jenny Langer.
Nice to meet you. I have an appointment with your father.
Oh, no, no, he passed away in 1952.
Oh, I'm so sorry, then the appointment must be with your husband.
- Not married.
- I'm not sorry.
- Ha.
Uh, then it's probably with your brother.
No, my brother's an interior decorator in Oshkosh.
You see, Dr. Vance, I'm afraid your appointment is with me.
I'm Dr. Jenny Langer.
Oh?
- And we have some very important business to discuss.
Yes, we do.
Ever been here before?
- No, but it's beautiful, the trees, the green foliage.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, I'm very fond of plants.
Oh?
- You know what we have at NASA?
- No, what?
Green tile and chrome.
- Ha ha ha.
You don't look the type.
Well, Doctor, you want to clue me in?
I'd certainly like to. You see, it was after the lecture last night, Mr. Vance, that I,
I suddenly discovered there were many peculiar things happening.
Yeah, like the gamma ray shower,
- Uh-huh.
The aurora and the barometer dropping like Wall Street.
Exactly and that's when I made those urgent calls to NASA.
Frankly speaking, I'm very concerned.
Well, frankly speaking,
Doctor, so is the
United States Government.
I'm still measuring an x-ray shower from the ground level at a magnitude never before measured on earth except in nuclear explosions.
Well, Doctor, it could be an abortive strike from a... unfriendly power.
Oh, come on! You don't think a missile landed here.
Well, that's one possibility, yes.
It could have been a falling object like a meteorite, not a missile.
Doctor, a meteorite would have made a tremendous explosion.
- Uh-huh.
Well, maybe it was an explosion.
Hello, Doctor.
- Anything new?
Nothing.
- Uh, Mary, this is Mr. Vance from NASA, Mary Johnson.
- Hello, Mary.
Doctor, your water's, uh, boiling.
Mary must have forgotten it.
Would you like some tea?
Tea? Heh, that's not my brand.
Oh, here are the reports from last night.
Now, let's see what happens today.
Mm-hmm.
- And over here.
Oh... look at this.
- Wow!
Radiation level's still high.
- Um-hmm.
Whatever landed hasn't gone away.
You know, Doctor, I think I will have that tea.
Ha ha, okay.
I told you there was nothin' out here. See, there's nothin'.
Yeah. So, why are you carrying your, your gun?
Aw, shut up!
My father always said tryin' to teach you to run a farm was like tryin' to teach an ox to use a typewriter.
Ever since you've been runnin' the place, everything's gone wrong.
Umph, I...
Now, watch.
See.
I just don't understand it.
Those radiation levels are far too lethal.
Anyone anywhere near the initial impact point would be in great danger.
What would be the safest way to find the exact point of impact?
Maybe we could use a helicopter.
No, no, be too dangerous.
- But...
Doctor, we have already lost one airplane crew.
I didn't know that.
Well, back to the tea.
- Back to the tea.
There's another one.
I can't tell what kinda critter coulda done that.
Eight dead cows and a calf.
You realize what this is gonna cost us?
It ain't gonna cost us nothin'.
Nine dead animals ain't gonna cost us nothin'?
You're so dumb, you wouldn't know rabbit turds from Rice Krispies.
I'll butcher up the meat like I always do and I'll sell it to Dutch's Cafe.
You don't even know what killed those cows.
There might be somethin' horrible wrong with the meat.
Well, that's Dutch's lookout, not mine.
I've never seen so much fouled up data in my life.
It's against every known law of physics.
Well, we've tried to brainstorm it.
And it just won't brainstorm.
- Right.
What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Doctor.
- Hmm?
Do you have a Geiger counter?
- Yeah, in the other office.
Good, let's see if your local sheriff will support us.
Sheriff Jones, ha ha ha, our jolly red giant?
I know just where he is.
Let's go.
You're going to love him.
You know he believes in Velikovsky's Theory, that the moon came out of the
Pacific Ocean.
So do I.
Hey, there's another one.
That's thirteen head, Dutch isn't gonna want that much meat.
So, I'll freeze some of it up and then sell it to him later.
Hey, look at this.
I've never seen a rock like that around here.
There's another one.
It's really weird.
Wow, look at that.
I told you something landed here last night.
Wonder what they are?
You know you can't tell from the outside.
We better bust one open.
And good morning to you all.
(in unison) Morning.
Hey, Helga, you're lookin' bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
You must've had some kind of a heavy date last night, huh?
You better believe it.
- One of the loggers?
That's my secret.
- Ha ha ha...
Well, Dutch, you got that limburger cheese smile on your face again this morning.
Have trouble last night?
Yeah.
- One of the loggers?
What does that mean?
- I don't know,
I've got trouble myself. Seemed like everyone was calling up with some cockamamie little thing, a car wouldn't start, the radio wouldn't work. And the preacher man, he kept everybody awake last night.
When does that gospel monger go on?
I don't know, but I'll tell ya, he may work for God, but he sure hollers like the devil. Ha ha ha...
Helga, ha ha ha.
Breakfast is ready.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Ooh, prunes. Ha ha.
Nope, it's not gonna work.
Go get me a hammer.
Not that one, the big one.
And a chisel.
Oh.
Git it yourself.
You never were any good with a tool.
Hey, look!
It split.
They look like diamonds.
I don know.
May not be hard enough to be a diamond.
Don't hit it, no, no! Diamonds are supposed to cut glass.
That's right.
Look at that!
- Damn!
Hello.
Oh, hi, Dr. Langer.
How are you this morning?
- Fine.
Won't you join me, please?
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
This your brother from Oshkosh?
No, this is Dr. Vance from NASA.
Hello, Sheriff.
- NASA, the National Aeronautics
Space Administration?
That Nassau?
- Um, yes, but it's NASA,
Houston, Texas.
- Sheriff, we have to talk to you about last night's disturbances.
Say no more, I'll get that preacher man to tone it down tonight.
- No, no, I don't mean that disturbance.
- Oh, no?
Pardon me, Doctor.
One of our local spiders, ha ha ha.
Uh, hey, what's that gizmo?
Uh, it's a Geiger counter.
A Geiger counter! We don't have any geigers around here, never did have in these parts.
- Uh, no, Sheriff, you misunderstand me. See, Dr.
Geiger invented this to count the nuclear...
- Oh, Vance, Vance,
I have a feeling the Sheriff's putting you on.
I'm sure he's taken physics.
- Oh, I used to take physics, but now I find that prunes do the better job for me.
We'll be rich to heaven, ha ha ha. We're gonna be rich.
What do you mean "we?"
This farm is mine and everything that's on it is mine.
You know, nobody ever found diamonds around here before.
Bet think they came out of that weird fireball thing last night.
I'll take these into cousin
Billy at the rock shop.
He can tell me just exactly what they're worth.
But don't, don't you tell cousin
Billy where you found 'em.
That'll be our secret.
Oh, don't look at me like that, Dan.
You and are going to be rich.
Hey, listen, I never meant any of those nasty things
I used to say to you,
I was, I was just teasing.
Honest. Everything can be wonderful again, just like it was before the baby died.
Knock it off, Ev. We don't even know if the diamonds are real.
Hi, Dr, Langer. Morning,
Sheriff.
Morning.
- Hello, dear.
May I join you?
- Please.
Thank you.
- This is Dave Perkins, his father runs the local newspaper.
Hello, Dave, nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Dr. Vance from NASA.
Nassau,huh?
- NASA, Houston.
Oh. What brings you here?
Anything I can publish in the paper?
- Oh, well...
That's classified.
Well, I'll put it in the classified section.
Ha ha ha. Well, that's safe enough, nobody reads your ads anyway.
Ha ha ha...
Oh, Dave, uh, could I speak to you for a moment?
Sure, Dr. Vance. Excuse us.
Excuse us for a moment.
Is he always that serious?
- Well, he has something to be serious about at this time.
You know, I wonder if what happened to Terry and I last night had something to do with what you're talking about?
What?
- What happened to you and Terry?
- Well, we were parked by the junkyard, the lights went... they went dead, the radio wouldn't work and the engine wouldn't start.
A wind came up and started...
I don't know, everything just went wrong.
You're hittin' the booze again, huh?
Leave me alone, I feel terrible.
This place is full of spiders.
Yeah, I know, little pink ones.
- No, no, big, big, black, hairy ones with furry legs
- Aha. Lay off the booze, Ev, and they'll go away.
Hello, Sheriff's Office.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper.
How are you?
Missing?
When'd you see him last?
You haven't seen him since last night?
Well, I'll be glad to... drive out and take a look for him.
What color is his motorcycle?
Come on, dear, please stop worrying. I'm sure he'll turn up safe and sound.
Yes, I'll get in touch with you.
Right, bye.
What's the matter with you?
You look like you could use a drink.
I found another body.
Another cow?
- No, a human body.
A Person?
But it was chewed up worse than them cattle.
We have to call the Sheriff.
Are you out of your mind?
Now, I buried that body and I hid the motorcycle.
No one will ever know.
You hid it?
- We can't let that sheriff come nosin' around here. What if he finds the diamonds?
And... and all that grass we're growing.
Well, you sound like you've been smokin' the stuff yourself.
Ew, oh!
And every creeping thing, that creepeth upon the earth, shall be an abomination.
Only the pure of heart shall be spared.
Oh, it's you.
- I told you I could come again tonight.
- How'd you swing it, honey?
Well, I told the lush that I had to come in and see my cousin about some hot rocks.
- Ha ha ha...
Oh, oh!
Hey, you forgot something.
No, I, I got it on.
- Your hot rocks.
Oh, thank you.
I always give you a big tip.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Ah, cousin Dan.
- Cousin Billy.
What brings you to town?
Hey, how's that hot little tomato you're raisin' out there, huh? Yeah, Terry's way overripe for pickin', you know?
- Oh, Terry's turnin' bad,
I can't control her anymore.
Oh well, she needs a gentle hand, like mine.
Never mind about that now.
Here, I got somethin' I want to show you. Wha-what is that?
That, that's a geode... that's not from around here.
You must've found that down south some place, huh?
Uh, take a look at these.
Just how good are these diamonds here?
Now, just between you and me...
- Yeah, yeah.
Ha ha ha...
Sorry. They're... industrial quality... yeah.
And the carbon content isn't nearly as high as a... a real diamond... a ring-type diamond.
Come on, how, how much are they worth?
Well, let's just say if you had a bucket full of these, a barrel full of these, yeah, you might be rich.
Where'd you find these?
Let's, uh, just say they, uh, fell outta the sky.
Ha ha...
What's going on now?
Those satellite reports you asked Paul Rider to send.
Great.
Here.
Huh, latitude 45 degrees, 21 minutes west.
Correction, north.
Longitude 88 degrees, 42 minutes west. That's more than a couple of square miles.
- I know, yeah.
Can't we pinpoint it closer than that?
Not from Telcom. I'm afraid you're going to have to use a helicopter.
- Okay.
Get Paul Rider, please.
Oh, Where the hell is Ev?
I don't know.
Damn, Ev is messy. Doesn't even clean.
Look at this here, cobwebs all over everywhere.
Whole goddamn house is filthy dirty.
Yeah well, Ev never was known for her cleanliness.
Least my room is nice and tidy.
Maybe I should of married you instead of her.
I was eleven years old.
Well, you're, uh, not any eleven now.
Yeah, now I'm 35-24-35.
Ah, listen Terry, uh, I could, uh, do things for you, if you know what I mean.
You never did anything for Ev, except drive her to drink.
Why don't you face it, you're just a big, fat failure.
Not anymore.
- Bull.
So, that, uh, rich Perkins punk, has he ever given you a diamond?
- You know he hasn't.
This diamond... is yours, if you treat me... nice.
You think you're gonna fool me with that phony rhinestone?
That is real enough. All you have to do is ask cousin Billy at the rock shop.
Where would you get a real diamond?
Oh, I... dug it up somewhere.
Hello.
Hi, Sheriff.
- Hi, Terry. ls Dan to home?
Dan.
Hi, Dan.
I'm checking out a missing person's report, cause
Mrs. Cooper asked me to find her husband and his motorcycle.
Now, she says he goes by here a lot and he's been missing for a day and a half. Have you seen a motorcycle around here?
Nope.
Terry, you and Dave seen or heard a motorcycle?
Uh-uh.
How about Ev?
- Drunk as a skunk.
Where is she?
- I don't know... and I don't care.
Well, if either of you two see or remember anything, give me a jingle, will ya?
Ha ha ha... Boy, that chopper makes nearly as much noise as that preacher man. Ha ha ha.
I've located a radioactive source, extremely high intensity
Can you pinpoint it?
- I'm over Bundy Road and Copper Place.
That's near the Kester place.
What does it look like?
- The whole pasture down there is distorted. Do you read me?
It's like I'm looking through on the bottom of a pop bottle.
I mean it's blurred and twisted.
Get a picture of it.
- Uh, get a picture of it and rush it to the lab, huh?
- Okay, will do.
It fits.
Space warp all right.
This must be the only energy photogram of it's kind.
Well, what's a space warp?
Well, Dave, a space warp is a gravitational pull, so intense, that it makes a black hole in space.
There's only one thing I know of that could cause a warp like this.
- A miniature black hole.
Uh huh.
- Could it happen?
Well, with a billion black holes in our galaxy, it's a wonder it hasn't happened before.
Well, Dr. Vance, Dr. Langer,
I've got to be going. Thank you.
Bye, Dave.
Well, everything fits.
Einstein's general theory of relativity.
- Mm hmm.
If a dead star collapsed all it's masses, the star would gradually shrink to a point and... disappear into another universe.
- Right, a parallel universe with a door back and forth.
- That sucks everything up.
And throws everything out.
This may be our problem. Where is this, uh-uh, Kester farm?
Oh, it's, uh, it's somewhere in the Harrison Hills area, right in here.
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, then they had swallowed us up quick.
Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! (in unison)
Can I get off early tonight?
- Not before 9:00. Why?
I have an aunt coming in from Barbasota.
Well, it's the same aunt as last night.
Tell her she left a hickey on your neck.
Hey, Dutch, what're we going to do about those damn spiders?
I'm going to try to get the preacher to exorcise them.
They're getting enough exercise already.
Oh, boy.
Hi, Terry.
- What are you doing here?
Where's, uh, cousin Dan?
- He's not here and neither is Ev.
- Pickup truck's still outside.
Well, maybe, but they're both gone.
Oh, well, that's all right,
I guess. You can probably help me out, hmm?
- Yeah and, uh, maybe, you can, uh, help me.
Is this a real diamond?
Naw, it's a fake. Ah, I'll give you five bucks for it.
I can always sell it to some dumb tourist.
I don't believe you.
You didn't even look at it.
Ok... I'll give ya... $20, hmm?
And only because you're my cousin.
You're Dan's cousin. You're no relation of mine.
Then we can, uh, have relations, hmm?
Billy, cut it out.
- Well, if we're not blood kin, then let's be, uh, kissing cousins, huh?
Billy, why don't you do what
I just did?
Yeah?
- Go home and take a cold shower
Uh, $40.
Did you hear the news?
Billy Kester's car just blew up.
He's dead?
- Yeah, he sure is, deader than a doornail. You know
Dave, a lot of strange things are happening around here.
- Yeah, I know, Dutch.
Can I use your phone?
Sure, use my private one in back.
Thanks, Dutch.
- Okay.
This should be the area, Vance.
I don't see anything.
No count here.
Well, there has to be something.
- Well, it's a normal count.
Nothing dangerous.
The Kester phone is dead.
Listen, I think I'm going to go on out there.
Okay.
- Bye.
Bob, Carl, Jack, Peter, listen!
Vance, what was that?
I didn't hear anything.
That sounded like a high-powered rifle.
This isn't hunting season.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Oh... oh!
Oh, God!
Hurry, Vance.
It's all right.
Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.
Yeah, well, all hell's broken loose. It's going to be hard to keep the lid on now.
- Yeah, we know all about it,
Sheriff. May I have another one, please?
Yeah, sure. My stomach is doing flip-flops.
We just brought back what was left of Joe Cooper.
Uh, Sheriff, if your stomach can handle it... we've got a 50 foot spider out there on the loose.
Fifty foot spider!
- Fifty feet.
You mean that's what got
Joe Cooper?
Looks like our black hole has turned into an open doorway from hell.
And we're gonna have to find a way to close it.
God knows how many monsters may come through.
And how many have already come through.
Doctor, please... what are these gizmos. I found them near the corpse.
You found them where?
- Near the corpse.
Uh, Sheriff, do you mind if we take these and, uh, run some tests of them.
- No, please do.
Oh, thank you. Do you have a flare gun we could use?
Yes, you can pick one up at the desk sergeant. He's got a couple of flares out there.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Sheriff.
- Right.
We'll keep in touch.
- Thank you.
Hello.
Yes, this is the sheriff.
Oh, Davey, I... didn't recognize your voice. What is it?
Is Terry all right?
Well, have Doc Oliphant check her, will you?
And keep me filled in on everything, please.
Thanks, Davey.
Fifty foot spider?!
Vance, I'm sorry to take so long, but the lab said it will a full two hours to get a report on these.
The only thing they said was they'd never seen anything like them.
Could sure crack 'em open.
We don't have time for that.
First things first.
We've gotta find someway to get out there and kill that monster.
- Oh, how you gonna kill a monster like this, an alien energy pattern?
We haven't even found even found the impact area of the black hole.
- Mm hmm, and that's undoubtedly where the spider's coming from.
- Right. The energy pattern has to feed off of the gravitational field of the black hole.
Vance, could we soak up the energy?
We could feed it so much extra mass we could choke it.
We can shower it with neutrons.
Neutron initiator.
It just might work.
What's up?
- I want you to fly me a Caltech Neutron Initiator right away.
Well, that's a pretty stiff order.
And I mean right away, buddy!
I think there's one in Madison.
- Tell them to load it with a six hundred gram charge and set the pattern at 360 degrees.
My chopper will pick it up at the airport.
All right.
- If it doesn't work, then, old buddy, we got company for dinner.
Three hours. Good-bye.
Well, it sounds like just the ticket.
Um, tell me, how does one of those gizmos work?
Yeah, sure.
Um, all right. Thanks, Vance.
I don't have to tell ya, you know what happened to the Kesters. Now, the spider's nest is somewhere on the Kester's ranch. We all have guns. When we leave here, we're gonna pick up all the relatives, friends, neighbors, anybody we can find.
And we're going to go out to the
Kester's farm and we're going to destroy that spider!
So, come on, let's go.
Hey. Hey, fellas, wait a minute.
Fellas, get around me.
Now, like I said inside, I want each of you to go in different directions and I want you to get your friends, relatives, anybody you can.
Dutch, what's goin' on?
All right, everybody just hold it. Listen to me.
Listen, Dutch, you're a troublemaker. I'm trying to tell you to knock it off.
Now, everybody go home.
We're not going to get it like this. Just knock it off!
Aw, you knock it off.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's go! Get in.
What's goin' on here?
Get outta here, go on home.
All right, everybody just... everybody just...
Hello. Yeah, this is the sheriff.
What?
In Gleason.
Are you sure they're headed this way?
Okay!
Hello, operator, give me the National Guard
Headquarters in Madison.
All right, now that we found it, now that we found it, once you seal off the hole, what's going to happen to the spiders?
- That's their energy pattern.
That's their lifeline and once we seal that off, they're gone.
But, what if the initiator doesn't work? There's going to be an army of those spiders crawling around, growing and multiplying.
Well, Jenny, it's already happening.
Vance!
Come here.
Lord knows how many of those things are around here.
Just take it easy.
Oh, look at this stuff.
Ugh! Agh! Oh!
What's the matter, what'd you do?
Ooooh!
- Oh, my God!
God, another one.
- Let's get out of here.
Let's get back to the jeep.
- Yes!
How will I ever...
Patch me through to the Sheriff.
Hello.
Yeah, Vance.
The spiders are all over at Gleason, just a few miles away.
Yes, I've called for the
National Guard, but the mobs are beginning to gather and they're getting out of hand.
Look, get somebody out here,
I just found another body or what's left of one.
And for God's sake, keep that mob away from here!
All right, you know why we're all here, you're gonna know we're gonna destroy that spider!
And you've all got your guns, they're all loaded.
Right, right.
- Now, no women!
No, no!
- Boo!
Come on now, Dutch, I want ya to get out of here, all of you.
I got a man from NASA and he knows what he's doing.
Gleason's a disaster area.
The same thing'll happen to this town. We'll handle it ourselves.
Come on!
The town got hit by the monster.
The crowd's getting out of hand,
I can't control 'em.
They're hellbent on destroying that beast.
Vance, did you ever see the movie "Jaws?"
Well, it makes that shark look like a goldfish.
I know, I know. But, try to keep them there as long as you can.
We're setting up the lights around here and the bomb's on it's way. And try to keep the spider there.
We can't do anything with the spider. Bullets don't hurt it.
The only thing I've got to stop it here with is a traffic light.
Sheriff, at least try.
This is the sheriff, get on the emergency unit.
I'm down here all by myself.
Call the National Guard back, tell them we need some heavy equipment, guns, ammo, anything.
And by one sign, you can know that the end of the world is near, Luke Chapter 21, Verse 10 and 11.
Nations shall rise up against nations and kingdom against kingdom.
And great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences.
And fearful sights and great signs shall there be from Heaven
The spider is retreating, heading out of town.
We've got a lot of people hurt here.
Clear the street, the spider's gone, spider's gone.
Get out of here.
You know that, that big one is like mother queen bee.
Yes, and she's activated all the spiders in this whole area.
Yeah, you think the smaller ones will grow to be giants?
Well, it could be, unless that neutron gadget works.
I wish that chopper'd get here.
Here comes somebody now.
Now what?
Vance!
- Clyde.
That big one, I just saw it up on the highway.
It's cuttin' through the woods and it's headin' this direction.
There goes the chopper now.
Can you patch me through?
- Sure, Vance, this way.
Caine, this is Vance. Caine this is Vance. Use your spotlight as a target and drop the gadget.
Want me to land and give you the trigger?
Hell, no! Now look, I'm gonna fire a flare and you pull the trigger.
- Okay.
Follow us, come on.
Jenny,
- Yes
I forgot the flares.
They're in the briefcase, would you get 'em?
I'll get them.
We've got company.
We've gotta keep her outta that black hole til we make the drop.
Okay, I'm gonna try.
- Good boy.
Ahhh! Ohhh! Oh!
Jenny, hurry with the flare gun, they're coming back.
Ooh!
Get back, you...
Believe it, it's as big as a house.
Vance! Vance!
- What happened?
Spiders came out of the briefcase. They're coming from the geodes.
- The what?
Geodes!
- Gimme this, come on.
Get over there and take cover.
All right.
Hey, come on. Everyone of you get out of there.
Hurry up, come on.
Get down!
Is it sealed? Is it sealed?
- Yeah, it's sealed.
Oh, God. This is... can it happen again?
I don't know.
Oh!
- I don't know.
When pharaoh refused the children of Israel their right to exist, the heavens opened up and deluged the land with flies, frogs, lice and locusts.
It happened before and it will happen again.
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Houston, the Energy City, home of the defending
Rollerball World Champions.
This key international battle pits divisional champions, visiting Madrid, against powerful Houston.
And here they come for a standing ovation.
On the track comes Houston.
Houston, led by captain Jonathan E., again their leading scorer this year.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Okay, right there. Let's go.
The controller indicates that he is ready, and our 30 Multivision cameras will be bringing you all the speed, thrills and excitement of this critical game.
Ladies and gentlemen, our corporate anthem.
The controller tests his computerized equipment, readies for the start of game action.
The traditional firing of the test ball will signal we're about set to go.
The controller for tonight's game, D.A. Niehaus.
The officials have given their approval for play. Each team...
Come on, man.
And now the crowd cheers once again as this Houston audience greets its team led by the storied athlete Jonathan E.
Corral's gonna break off.
Okay, boys! Okay.
Houston! Houston!
Now the play-by-play. Here's RD.
The computer counts down, one second, the ball...
First period is underway here in Houston tonight.
The first team to pick up the ball will be on offense as they try for the score.
And it's a pickup by Houston.
It's picked up by BJ.
Yay!
BJ moves it around the track.
He'll try to maneuver for the leading score...
Go on, go on.
Watch it!
Jonathan E. holds the ball aloft.
He must hold it out in plain view at all times.
Pick them up! Pick them up!
I got them! I got it!
On your right! On your right! Now, baby!
Jonathan moves up the track and up on to the side.
Here comes Sanchez for Madrid.
Sanchez grabs Jonathan from behind, but off the rail comes Moonpie and takes out four Madrid men.
The old swooper, Moonpie, with his favorite maneuver, made a move from the top of the rail and took out four Madrid men.
The remaining Madrid skaters set up their defense in front of the goal.
Jonathan still has the ball.
Moving in, he'll try to cover the slot, and surely does!
Jonathan in front, shoots, and it's just wide!
Regroup!
The Houston team will have to regroup.
Injured on the play is Belmonte, and he's helped off the track for Madrid.
First period, no score, as we get set for the firing of the second ball.
Oh, and it hits the biker Carter!
Knocks Carter down...
Give me a hand. Move out!
Come on, look alive!
Jonathan is there, it is handed off, the pass is complete to Jonathan.
He skates by and knocks him down again!
Did you see that penalty?
And the officials look this over...
Keep up. Keep up.
Moon, on your left. On your left.
Right, right, right. I got him!
Break it up! Break it up!
Go, Jonathan, go!
Here comes Houston for the first goal of the game.
He shoots, he scores!
Yeah!
And at the end of the first period,
Jonathan's goal gives Houston a one-to-nothing lead over Madrid.
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.
The time, first period, 12 minutes.
The ball is fired for the start of the second period.
Madrid trailing by one goal, trying to go on offense to tie the score.
Go, Madrid!
Watch your left!
Who did it?
Coming around the track...
Come on, Madrid, come on.
Inside of the bike, he skates up in front.
Gonzales still has it for Madrid.
Hands off again, this time to Bodeas.
Bodeas on offense for the Madrid team.
Here's the Houston defense in a four-man defense...
Shot! It is cleared.
And out of the pack goes Bodeas, but he's all right, he's not injured, but his scoring attempt failed.
And the score is still one-to-nothing in favor of Houston.
The ball is fired again. Madrid is pressing now, putting the pressure on...
Keep it moving!
All right, come on, let's move it.
We got it now.
Sanchez is moving to his left and right, has a full head of steam, still going in on offense, trying to tie the score.
Sanchez moves around the bike, takes a long look and shoots and he scores!
Sanchez scores with a play that ties the game at 1-1.
Second period.
The ball is in play again, intercepted this time by Haskell.
Three minutes. Get off.
Madrid penalty.
Three minutes, biking misconduct on number one, Meitzer.
Are you satisfied, Madrid? What kind of game are you guys playing out there?
Take it easy, take it easy.
You'll be okay.
This crowd's going wild, loving the wide-open action in this quarterfinal game.
Skate! Skate!
Come on, God damn it, skate!
Houston! Houston!
All go down, pileup on the track, the ball rolls free and into the gutter. It's a dead ball.
Come here, come here!
Come on, block that side.
Come on, move out.
How is it, Jonathan?
- Give me a tie, will you, Bo?
- Sure.
Come on, dude!
Three minute penalty. Hey!
Don't give me any of that.
Off the track. Off the track.
Group up.
Hold the line! Hold the line!
Up and over the Madrid defense, gets up in front of the goal and he jams it in for the score!
Jonathan jams it in and scores to get Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid.
Houston with the ball again here in the third period.
Stop it!
He has it.
Jonathan behind the bike, coming in low with a great maneuver, he shoots, he scores!
That's the way! You got it!
I love this game,
Moonpie. I love it.
Yeah.
So, we've got two games left.
Guess who we play first? Tokyo.
Now who would have thought they'd make it to the playoffs?
They're good.
They've got the old samurai spirit.
Yeah, but they're only about this tall.
Yeah, well, two or three little things make one big thing.
They're liable to climb all over you and eat your lunch.
I can't get on a man-to-man basis with a pigmy or an oriental.
I don't know what it is.
You were fine tonight, all of you.
Mean. Sharp.
Thank you.
Your fellas did well again.
Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew, sir.
Thank you.
You? You rode. You really rode.
Yeah.
You play like our champion here.
You take lessons from him?
No. We just give lessons to the other team.
Yeah!
How are you, Jonathan?
I'm feeling mean, Mr. Bartholomew.
It's good to see you.
Jonathan E. That's the name.
Houston players come and go, but the champion plays on.
Yeah!
The corporation has a hard time, Moonpie, figuring out ways to pay the champion properly.
We can't think up any more rewards for him.
You'd like us to have that problem with you, wouldn't you?
Yes, sir.
Like Jonathan, you play with abandon, but this is Jonathan's season.
Every season seems to be Jonathan's season, but this year, we've got you on Multivision.
A special show all about you.
No player ever had that before.
The whole world will be watching, because this is your year.
You got it, babe.
So, two games left.
That's right, Mr. Bartholomew.
New York in the final!
Team seems healthy, champion says he feels mean, no problems here.
What is this, fruit juice?
Very healthy, Mr. Bartholomew, very healthy.
Sweet dreams, Moonpie.
It's a bad habit you got there.
You know what that habit will make you dream, Moonpie?
You'll dream you're an executive.
And you'll have your hands on all the controls, and you'll wear a gray suit, and you'll make decisions.
But you know what, Moonpie?
You know what those executives dream about out there, behind their desks?
They dream they're great rollerballers.
They dream they're Jonathan.
They have muscles, they bash in faces.
Let's go. Can't keep these boys here all night.
Jonathan, come and see me tomorrow.
Quiet, boys, quiet.
This is a great team.
A great city. Great stuff out there tonight.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Good morning.
- How are you, sir?
Brutal game last night.
Oh, thank you.
Continue to hold my calls, all right? Thank you.
Come in, Jonathan.
Keep silence with me for a minute, won't you?
It's important to have a place to think things out.
You have your ranch. I know you take a lot of pleasure in it.
I, uh, cut my finger.
I'm sorry. Here.
You've had an amazing career, Jonathan.
You know how proud we are of the Houston team, and what we think of you, the energy?
But now, there are executives who want you out.
Sir?
You've had 10 years in this game, Jonathan.
Longer than anyone, ever.
Retire? How can I do that?
On your special program.
There are some who feel that this program should now be used to announce your retirement.
Who wants that?
When this special was first planned by
RCI Energy, we saw it as a good thing.
Now the executive directorate wants a change.
The program is scheduled, the whole world is waiting for it, so this does seem the perfect time.
You know, the team, they, uh, they depend on me.
Jonathan, let's think this through together.
You know how a game serves us?
It has a definite social purpose.
Nations are bankrupt, gone, none of that tribal warfare anymore.
Even the corporate wars are a thing of the past.
I know that. It's just...
So now, we have the majors and their executives.
Transport, food, communication, housing, luxury, energy.
A few of us making decisions on a global basis for the common good.
The team, is a unit.
It plays with certain rhythms.
So does an executive team, Jonathan.
Now, everyone has all the comforts, you know that.
No poverty, no sickness, no needs and many luxuries, which you enjoy just as if you were in the executive class.
Corporate society takes care of everything, and all it asks of anyone, or has ever asked of anyone, ever, is not to interfere with management decisions.
I know. I don't mean to resist.
I'm just trying to understand.
This is for your own benefit.
You must know that, Jonathan.
All decisions concerning you are.
Well, I, uh, lost Ella.
The corporation took my wife away because an executive wanted her.
I'm not gonna review all that again.
It was before I took over here, and I had nothing to do with it.
And from what I hear, your wife wanted to leave herself.
So, now you're going to retire.
That shouldn't be too hard for you.
It's a stupid game, after all. Awful game.
You ought to be glad to be out of it.
I don't...
I don't know, Mr. Bartholomew.
I just don't know.
I realize you had nothing to do with Ella leaving...
- Jonathan, I...
- But, um...
You're right.
I mean, I ought to do it.
I ought to be perfectly happy to do what you say...
Take your time. Take a few days.
You've just come through a game. You're tired.
Go to your ranch, but think about it, and understand it.
Do understand it.
Because I don't understand your resistance, and I don't think anyone else will, either.
Was your flight okay?
Yeah. Is Clete here?
He's in the training room.
I'm gonna go say hello.
- Jonathan.
- Hmm?
Look what I got for breakfast.
Hmm?
It's a notice from the corporation.
What's it say?
Oh, that I should get out of here.
You know, go away, vanish.
That kind of thing.
You know anything about that?
Yeah, I kind of heard something about it.
You knew it was coming.
We've been together six months.
Didn't you even want to say goodbye?
We'll talk about it later, okay?
You didn't, did you?
Hmm?
You didn't even want me here when you got back.
I gotta go see Cletus.
What do you want me to do in the meantime?
I want you to take it easy.
Uh...
I want you to go in and fix us something to eat.
Clete's come a long way and I'm hungry.
All right?
Okay.
Jonathan?
I'm glad you're all right.
Come on. All right, come on.
Come.
I'm tired enough.
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well...
- I caught you, didn't I, baby?
- Huh?
- Two games running.
- What?
You did that in the last two games.
Show the forward left.
You're standing on your left skate.
Do that in Tokyo, they'll take your arm home for lunch.
You with me?
Okay.
You practice that a little for me, huh?
All right.
Hell, I forget which corporation is which.
Any ass knows that fire's energy.
What about the music? Where's the music come from, huh?
Okay if I have one of these?
Go on, have all of it.
I forget what corporation's running what city.
Chicago's still a food city, but what about Indianapolis?
Whatever happened to that town?
Whatever happened to Mackie?
Yeah, things were much simpler when I was a kid.
We still had three nations.
That was before the corporate wars, even before rollerball.
Before everything.
You believe in kids?
I remember someone telling me about the National Football
League and the World Cup.
Where you going?
Indianapolis.
What do you know about that stuff, Clete?
I mean...
Know how the corporations got started, about the corporate wars?
They were nasty! Whoo!
But nobody talks about that.
Well, except among friends.
Yeah.
I remember your rookie year.
You were mean and tight.
Best player I ever coached.
Nobody could lay a hand on you that year.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
Look, I... I gotta ask you something.
It figures. Go ahead.
I'm listening.
Well...
Something going on with the game.
I don't know what it is. I don't think I'm supposed to know.
What's that?
They want me to quit.
And why would they want you to do that?
I don't know.
That's what I'd like you to find out.
I can try.
Hear just about everything going on in the game one way or another.
That's what I mean.
I can't think of another executive who'd tell me a thing.
Well, like I say, I'll...
I'll try.
But I don't think there's much I...
Look...
No troubles for either of us, Clete.
Just find out what you can.
Well, trust me, Jonathan, you know you can.
Sure.
Sit down.
Yeah.
Nice, boys.
Yo, Johnny.
That's the Houston stride.
You boys want to make this team, play for
Houston, you're gonna have to learn it.
We pride ourselves on being a power team.
That's right.
We're power. We're mean.
Now, that doesn't mean to say we'd like to have you hanging back there on a rail, in a fistfight, just standing there fighting somebody in section A when you're supposed to be in section B.
I'm coming up to score, and you ain't in the section you're supposed to be in, don't do us no good.
Right.
Who's the two new catchers here?
Right.
Give me that ball.
Don't, uh.
Stick your hand in that gutter too quick.
Wait till this ball comes down on the track.
Don't get too anxious. That thing will take your arm right off.
Now, the bikers.
A biker might sacrifice a little three-minute penalty and run over the top of a skater...
Uh-huh.
If he feels that he's skating a little too good that day.
So we have a few methods here in Houston.
There's hundreds.
One, of course, is to use this shield here.
Use your pads. Use what you got.
Drive that arm in there.
Keep your feet forward.
Hit and move.
You get away from the wreck.
Always keep your feet here.
Don't come across in here.
You get all twisted. That's sad.
Or if a biker's sitting up nice and high...
A lot of guys like to ride high.
Drag one off them in there.
I hurt you, Blue?
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.
Now, third method, kind of one that was perfected by a little friend of mine, the swoop.
Swooper, that's me.
Hang up on the rail, use all the speed of the track, come down and drop-kick a biker.
Say, excuse me.
You're not paying a whole lot of attention, are you?
Hey, what's this dude's name?
That's our new speedball from Manila.
Yeah, you know.
You know, that's Toughie.
Come on up, Tough.
Always a big honker.
Say, why don't you do me and the boys a favor,
I mean, since you know everything there is to know...
We'd sure appreciate it, I want you to give us a little demonstration.
Show us how you made that big rep down there.
Just skate around and just take me out, huh?
Go get him, Toughie.
Now, eyes, use them.
Don't lock your eyes on any one spot.
This game isn't all in the muscle.
Use your head.
Lock your eyes on the target, keep...
Ears, now, they're real important, too.
If there's anything I love, it's luxury centers.
When I get my privilege card,
I know what I'm gonna get me, too.
Secretary.
Why do you want a secretary?
Are you planning on becoming an executive?
I just need one.
About this tall.
Yeah?
Why don't you give it a rest?
Hello.
Can I help you, please?
Yeah, I tried to order some books, and they sent me this notice said I had to appear at the center personally.
That's right. This is our circulation unit.
You can make your choice here or by catalog.
There must be some mistake.
The books you've ordered are classified and have been transcribed and summarized.
Well, who summarizes them?
I suppose the computers summarize them.
What'd you need books for?
Just want to study up on some things.
You could go to the computer center where the real librarians transcribe the books, but we have all the edited versions in our catalog.
Anything I think you'd want.
Well, let's see then.
This is not a library, and you are really not a librarian.
I'm only a clerk. That's right.
I'm sorry about it really.
And the books are really in computer banks being summarized.
Where is that?
Well, there's a computer bank in Washington.
The biggest is in Geneva.
It's a nice place to visit.
- Yeah.
- I guess that's where all the books are now.
Yeah. Well, thank you.
It's not that exactly.
Yeah, but books, Jonathan?
I mean, anything you want to know, you could hire yourself a corporate teacher, see?
I mean, you can call somebody up.
Use your privilege card.
I can't. That's just it.
I feel there's something going on.
Somebody's pushing me.
Who? Bartholomew?
But you're Jonathan E.
Everybody knows you.
You've got everything.
You know you'll be treated right.
You always have been.
Yeah. I don't know.
But I do know! We're living good.
You know we are.
I found this to wear.
Is it all right?
That's the uniform of the house.
I'm Daphne.
Yeah. That figures.
Well, that's all right.
Here. Wear these, too.
That's right, no penalties!
Limited substitutions.
You can handle it!
Beat Tokyo!
All we gotta do is change our tactics.
- That's it.
- Three times...
There's always been rule changes.
Now, look, you know that!
It gets more people to watch the game. That's all there is to it.
Look, you all signed contracts to finish out the season, no matter what the alterations in the game.
Now every last one of you signed.
See? Now we all signed a contract.
That doesn't matter! There's no way we're gonna lose, no matter how they change the game.
That's right. That's right.
All it means is a change of strategy.
Now, we knock out the bikers early, we take care of their skaters.
Don't try to score yourselves.
And the game's yours.
Now, you watch yourselves out there.
They're playing the same rules we are.
It's gonna be rough, but it's still basically the same game.
And the team with the power wins.
Come on.
Hey, Rusty.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
Hey, Rusty, come on.
Listen.
You were talking about them contracts.
How come everyone else is being asked to play with the no-penalty rule, and they're pressuring me to quit?
I don't know.
But can't you do what you're told?
For your own good, get out.
I...
I don't want to leave the guys to play Tokyo with the rules breaking down. I mean...
Jonathan, it doesn't matter what you want!
Think about that.
These we did in slow motion to show the impact of your blows on opposing players.
Yeah, fine.
We want you to approve the sequences.
It's, uh...
It's all fine with me.
Anything.
I really don't see why I'm needed here.
Well, the Energy people want you to be satisfied.
Huh.
There, now, isn't that a marvelous shot?
Sure.
I'm a stat freak myself.
Isn't that perverse?
You got anything I can take?
Just... Just take one.
Statistics, huh?
Yes, the greatest number of points scored in a single game, 18.
The highest velocity of a ball when actually fielded by a skater,
120 miles per hour.
Most deaths...
Please, don't do that.
Oh.
Most deaths, nine. Rome versus
Pittsburgh. December, last year.
The greatest number of players and substitutes put out of action by a single player in a single game, 13.
A world's record, courtesy of your dear self.
There have been studies, you know, of stat freaks in rollerball.
Well, some go to the track, but they never take their eyes off the big board.
What's this?
As for myself, I've always wondered if a rollerball player sees himself as a class apart.
"Hello. Pause.
"I'm Jonathan E. Smile.
"I would like..." Is this for me?
Very astute, yes.
It's your retirement announcement.
Your special is already scheduled and announced all over the world.
You're supposed to read this as part of the program.
What sort of pill did you give me?
Pure aphrodisiac, Daph.
Enjoy yourself, dear.
Can we finish up there and go home?
You are being recorded.
Feeling a little woozy, are you?
Try to read the announcement.
I'm all right.
Why don't you read... the...
Oh, you... You want that, do you?
You are making things very difficult...
How many... How many assignments you been on, Daph?
I know you're good at what you're good at, so, you must have been around some.
A lot of girls have stayed with me but you know that.
Never seem to mind.
But odd thoughts I've had about you, Daph, odd thoughts.
I wondered if you'd been briefed on me.
I'm going to have to ask you to read...
Yeah, a lot of things occurred to me, Daph, a lot of things.
A lot of things occur to you?
You look terrible.
You do look terrible.
Come on.
See, you shouldn't take anything offered to you just like that.
What was in it?
Nothing to hurt you.
Maybe you're just a little too trusting.
You ever think of that?
And hook 'em deep now!
I'll do that.
Thank you.
As you know, the Tokyo game is coming up.
And you'll remember that the Tokyo team uses various karate and hapkido techniques.
We will review these techniques with special attention to the use of death blows.
Same lecture every year.
There are certain body areas that the skilled opponent will endeavor to strike...
What we got for our skilled opponents is the old Houston fist-in-the-face technique.
Right?
Especially in a game with no penalties...
You got to get mad, all right? Play hard!
It don't matter that they're all tiny little men on that team.
Especially in a game with no penalties and limited substitution.
Get mad and fly!
Please...
Now, there's certain body areas that I know about, too.
Now, what we gotta do is hit those guys in the ganglion.
Where?
In the ganglion.
It's a mess of nerves right here under the ear.
Now, what you gotta do is drive the jawbone up in that mess of nerves and it rings a bell.
You must understand.
The Tokyo team has a very eccentric playing style.
And no penalties, all right?
If I go down, I know my team is with me!
- Right?
- Please...
Brute speed!
Familiarize yourself with the basic fighting art techniques.
And nobody is gonna take us, rules or no rules!
Go on. Go on.
This is the Houston team!
Rules or no rules!
We fight for each other!
Houston! Houston!
They're really quite beautiful in a wild kind of way.
I can almost smell the lions.
Don't be silly.
They're made in Detroit.
Yes, they're androids.
They're all programmed.
That's right. The whole game is played by robots.
They look like men, and they...
Not so loud. They'll hear you.
It'll ensure stability, expansion and high profits for the planetary enterprise.
What do you think about it?
Exciting. You make it sound absolutely romantic.
He's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.
I know and he's so intelligent.
We're practically living on krypens.
Hey, there he is.
Hey, Johnny boy. Hey, kid!
Come on, well, let's hear it! Come on.
Give me a hand here.
Give me a hand, will you?
Behave yourself.
Hello, Mackie.
Well, how you been?
You know, it's your night tonight, Jonathan.
You having a good time?
Well...
Well, I'm glad you're here.
I'm here with an executive.
He asked all about you.
He wanted to know if I enjoyed you.
Hey, Rocky.
Hey, come here and give me a hand.
Get on over here.
There's too many of them.
Well, what about the new game?
Actually, I haven't heard much about it.
The rule changes were announced a week ago.
- That so?
- Who changed them?
That's what I've been trying to find out.
Look, rules or no rules, it's still the same game.
What I'm really looking forward to is the program.
When you see that screen replay afterwards...
Excuse me.
Did you hear about Evans?
What?
He's out. Gone.
No kidding.
The old man?
Who got him?
- What?
- I said who got him?
The Crocodile.
Hey. do you like poetry?
Mmm-hmm.
Let's go upstairs?
I got a poem for you.
Ooh.
Welcome, sports enthusiasts everywhere.
Tonight, Multivision trains its cameras on the amazing career of Jonathan E.
In those years that Houston began to mold itself into a world championship team with the attacking style of their lead scorer...
Jonathan, come on.
Come on, come on.
Jonathan E., has always been the team's strongest asset.
Yes, the game seems invented for him.
Defense! Defense!
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!
Right on!
Look, I talked to everybody I could.
And there is something going on.
Yeah, you... You're right about that.
Nobody will talk about it.
I mean nobody!
It's hard finding anything out,
Jonathan. You know that.
Hell, nobody even knows the names of the men on the directorate anymore.
Look, I'm sorry, I...
They want you out. You know that.
Yeah.
Well, do you know who they are?
Bartholomew, I guess.
Mmm-mmm.
Above Bartholomew.
It's the Executive Directorate.
Why are they worried about me?
It's what they do.
They're even after the old man because he didn't get your retirement announced tonight.
How come they put the program on without it?
I think they had to. They didn't want to. It's very tricky.
Jonathan, look... There's one thing you ought to know.
Look, nobody said it, but I'm sure of it.
Hmm.
They're afraid of you, Jonathan.
All the way to the top, they are.
What are they afraid of me for?
Oh, no. Don't go yet.
We're showing some replays.
Well, let's see 'em then.
Let's see 'em.
Mr. Bartholomew would like to see you now. He's in the study.
Come on hurry up. Over there.
You know I've always considered your situation, Jonathan.
And your needs.
Now, you have to consider mine.
And ours.
I'm considering it,
Mr. Bartholomew.
No player is greater than the game itself.
It's a significant game in a number of ways.
The velocities of the ball, the awful physics of the track.
In the middle of it all, men, playing by an odd set of rules.
It's not a game men are supposed to grow strong in, Jonathan.
You appreciate that, don't you?
More and more, Mr. Bartholomew.
Shoot that statue.
That's the one. Shoot that!
Hey...
- The tree!
- Yeah! Come on!
You must take good advice.
You're not to play against
Tokyo, you're not to play again.
I want some concessions.
Concessions!
Believe me, I'd be happy to talk a deal, Jonathan.
I love deals.
But this situation is much, much simpler.
This Multivision event tonight was very embarrassing.
For me and for others.
Well... it might be I won't ever find out why
I've been asked to leave the game.
But I do know I can get some concessions and I want them.
Oh, you missed!
I want to see Ella. My wife.
Arrange it so I can see her again.
That's not easy, Jonathan.
I want other concessions, too, Mr. Bartholomew.
Oh! Oh-ho! Look at that!
Give...
By my life, that's incredible!
- Oh!
- That's terrific.
Look at all those flames!
Specifically, you're bargaining for the right to stay in a horrible social spectacle.
It has its purposes, and you've served those purposes brilliantly.
Why argue when you can quit?
And you say you want to know why decisions are made.
Your future comfort is assured.
You don't need to know.
Why argue about decisions you're not powerful enough to make for yourself?
Energy will treat you well.
You know that.
If the rule changes stay the same, Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm playing with my team.
Too late. The rule change is scheduled and announced.
There's no going back.
You've seen to that.
Then I'll see you in Tokyo.
You can be made to quit.
You can be forced.
You can't make me quit.
Hey, watch out!
Don't tell me I can't.
Don't ever say that!
I can!
You can be stopped!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Look, it's all going too fast.
I'm not packed yet. Can't you...
Forget it. You're not going, Daph.
Those bags are ready.
Here. Hold on.
Take this extra hat, will you?
Sir? I've had a call.
I've been asked to go over to Energy.
You're not going to Tokyo then?
What do you mean I'm not going?
I suppose I will later. I hope this isn't an inconvenience.
No. No. It's... No problem.
I'm supposed to go with you.
Well, what's that mean?
Who... Who told you you're supposed to go with me? Hmm?
Nobody told me.
Listen, Jonathan, I really want to go with you.
I do, really.
You'll need me.
Just get yourself another assignment, will you, Daph?
Everybody is an assignment.
Life's an assignment.
Here you go.
You'd better do as you're told,
Jonathan. That's all I have to say.
You threatening me?
Don't be here when I come back.
You won't be back, Johnny boy...
Don't try to frighten me,
Daphne. You don't know how.
Look...
You go tell them people that I'm going to Tokyo and you're not, huh?
- You tell 'em.
- No!
Ciao.
Teller.
Make sure my gear gets to the track in Tokyo.
I'm gonna travel with the team this trip.
You call transportation and tell them.
Yes, sir.
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!
What chance does Houston have of defeating Tokyo tonight?
Well, both teams have fine players and different styles.
What do you say, Moonpie?
Well, yeah, yeah, but...
But it's not an even match, see.
'Cause the Tokyo team has all these little short guys.
Tokyo! Tokyo!
Tokyo! Tokyo!
What about the rule changes?
Well...
At Houston, we kind of play a wide-open system.
Will you comment, though, about playing in a game where the rules are always changing?
Game's always had rule changes.
They don't affect the good teams.
You're a great new player.
What's the secret of your success on the track?
Oh, it's no secret.
I just imitate him.
And plastic surgery keeps me beautiful.
There are rumors that the last game of the season will be played without time limit.
Any comments?
Well, I don't think it'll come to that. It's still a game.
There also are rumors, some say you're retiring from the game.
Here I am.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!
Corporate society was an inevitable destiny.
A material dream world.
Everything man touched became attainable.
Yeah. I've been touched all my life.
One way or the other.
Either caressed or hit.
It don't like seem to matter which anymore.
I guess that's why I wanna see Ella again.
See if I still feel things now.
You know what I mean?
Yeah...
Here are some other things, too.
I mean, they took
Ella away from me.
Now, they're trying to push me out.
And I'd sure like to find out why.
I think I'll go to one of them computer centers.
See what I can find out.
Yeah.
Finding out things, it's...
That's the thing, Moonpie.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Tokyo.
And tonight's dramatic semifinal match for the World's Rollerball
Championship between host Tokyo and the high-flying defending champions from Houston.
Late rule changes tonight will be no penalties called, and there is limited substitution.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you stand, please, for the playing of our corporate hymn.
Tokyo! Tokyo!
Game controller for tonight's game, C. C. Nakamura.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Just wanna get out there and hit them little fellas.
Listen, stay close now, all right?
Yeah.
Okay, Johnny, let's go! Let's go!
Attention. Your attention, please.
Rule changes for tonight's game.
Limited substitution and no penalties.
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!
Tokyo! Victory!
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
The controller checks the computer.
Ready to fire the first ball, and the first ball is fired. The game is underway!
Remember again, there'll be no penalties called tonight and limited substitutions.
This promises to be a punishing game for both teams tonight.
- Here they come!
- Let's wrap around.
Spread! Spread around!
All right, boys. Go ahead.
Watch out!
Stick him! Stick him!
Tokyo! Victory!
Stay close, now, stay close.
Stick with him!
Take it! Take it in!
Go! Go! Go!
It's a scramble in front of the goal.
They all go down. Kogo won it, and he scores!
Kogo scores, shooting from his kneeling position in front of the goal.
And Tokyo takes a one-to-nothing lead over Houston.
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
With Tokyo leading one to nothing.
Houston being pressured by the fastest opening game.
The second ball is fired.
Spread.
Look out!
Spread out!
Tight defense!
Move ahead, Pete!
Move it.
No doubt the faster tactics of the Tokyo team.
And now, Houston, their bikers and skaters form a wall.
Tokyo! Victory!
- Hold 'em. Fast now.
- Pull out their hair.
Move it!
Watch the ball!
Jam them out of there!
Hold 'em!
Get 'em!
Watch him!
Bike him! Bike him!
Bike him! Bike him!
You got it, baby! You got it!
The ball is fired, and the second period is underway, with Tokyo leading one-to-nothing.
Houston forced to come from behind tonight.
Are you all set up?
Watch the men behind me.
Watch the men behind me.
The ball is in play.
And it's grabbed by
Carter for Houston.
Houston on the offensive attack.
Whoo!
Whoo!
What more have you got? Come on!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Go! Let's go!
Right at the slot. Free man, and he scores!
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.
The time, 12:05, second period.
I love this game!
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!
Grab on there! Grab on there! Yeah!
Some injuries here as three players are helped off the track.
Spread!
Yeah! Right!
Come on, Moonpie! Moonpie!
Over here! Over here!
What the hell are those guys doing?
I don't know. Come on. Stay close.
I told you stay close.
All right. Turn 'em loose next time around, all right?
- All right. Go on.
- Yeah.
Go on. Go on. Go on! Come on!
Moonpie!
I got him. I got him.
Let me have him.
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
Medic.
Everything'll be all right.
Come on. Just sit down over here.
Sit right here.
Everything'll be all right.
Medic! Hey, medic! Come over here!
Come on.
Moonpie!
Come on, Moonpie.
Come on, get some help!
Set him down. Set him down.
Where's oxygen?
Come on, Tokyo! Go and get them!
Go! Go! Go, Tokyo!
Okay, now come on, now!
Jonathan, watch yourself out there.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Take me high, Blue.
Tokyo! Victory!
Look out!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan E.
Time in the third period...
Spread! Spread! Go kill 'em!
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
Fall out! Fall out!
Blue.
This way, please.
May I say first, please, that you played a superb game in our city.
Thank you.
A simple problem, yet I know it is difficult for you.
Your teammate has no family we can contact, and permission is required now before consummating matters.
So he's technically dead?
Yes, unfortunately.
His heart and lungs will function, but his brain is...
It has expired.
From the first minutes we had him, it was hopeless.
I believe this was explained to you.
He's warm.
Yes.
But if you will, please. You must sign a release form. It is required.
Does he...
Does he dream?
No. There is no brain wave at all.
No sort of consciousness.
Just a deep coma.
A vegetable.
No dreams. Nothing.
Well, even...
A plant feels something.
Who can say? Please.
It...
Senses life. I mean, it turns towards the sun.
It's alive, isn't it?
You must sign.
You...
You just leave him the way he is.
Just leave him as he is.
Someone will have to sign.
There's no other way.
Arrangements will be made.
Please. There are hospital rules that have to be...
No, there aren't.
There aren't any rules at all.
Let me know if you have any problems.
You won't find any answers in Geneva.
Take care of your arm.
In my opinion, we are confronted here with something of a situation.
Otherwise, I would not have presumed to take up your time.
Once again, it concerns the case of Jonathan E.
We know we don't want anything extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.
We already agreed on that.
No accidents, nothing unnatural.
The game was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort.
Let the game do its work.
If the Energy Corporation has done all it can and if a champion defeats the meaning for which the game was designed, then he must lose.
I hope you agree with my reasoning.
Thank you, all.
Will you follow me, please?
Hello, hello!
Yes, it is the famous Jonathan E.
Oh, hard to believe.
Sorry we've never met.
The Rollerball Champion.
Wonderful.
Not many people come to see us, you know.
We're not easy to talk to, Zero and I.
We're a little confused again in here today.
This is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing to misplace things.
Misplacing data?
Mmm. The whole of the 13th century.
Misplaced the computers, several conventional computers.
We can't find them.
We're always moving things around, getting organized.
My assistants and I.
But this, this is Zero's fault.
Zero. He's the world's file cabinet.
Eh, pity. Poor old 13th century.
Well, come along now.
You want to get started, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh.
- Hmm?
This way.
Now...
But we've lost those computers with all of the 13th century in them.
Not much in the century, just Dante and a few corrupt Popes, but it's so distracting and annoying.
You've unlimited restrictions here, of course.
You have to come so, so many times.
It all takes such... Such effort.
Do the executives still come here?
Oh, they used to, some of them.
What about the books?
Books? Books? Oh, no, they're all changed, all transcribed, all information's here.
I mean, Zero, of course. He's the central brain, the world's brain.
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.
He's liquid, you see.
He's water to touch.
All knowledge.
Everything we ask has become so, ah, so complicated now.
Each thing we ask...
This morning, we wanted to know something about the 13th century.
He flows out into all our storage systems.
He considers everything.
He's become so ambiguous now.
As if he knows nothing at all.
Could you tell me something about the corporate wars?
Wars? Wars?
Oh, yes, of course, we have them all here.
Punic War, Prussian
War, Peloponnesian War.
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.
One doesn't perhaps recall them in sequence, but corporate wars.
Well, Zero will or can, I'm sure, tell you anything.
A memory pool, you see.
He's supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean.
Look, Zero, a visitor.
Jonathan E., the Rollerball Champion.
You've filed away a lot of data on him.
Do you remember?
Does it answer you?
Oh, yes. He speaks.
He finds things.
And loses them, and confuses itself.
Ask anything.
He'll find it for you.
A section on Bach...
Won't you, Zero?
All right. I'd like...
I'd like some information about corporate decisions.
How they're made and who makes them.
Zero...
You heard the question.
Answer him.
Negative.
You don't have to give him a full political briefing.
Answer.
Negative.
This is Jonathan E.
He has to know.
Make it simple.
Answer.
Corporate decisions are made by corporate executives.
Corporate executives make...
I know we have the answers.
We do have. They're the waters of history.
Energy equals genius...
I don't want to bully you.
Genius is energy.
Corporate entities control...
I shall have to answer!
Of economic life, technology, capital, labor, and markets.
Corporate decisions are made...
You have to, Zero.
Let's show him policy.
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.
Hello, Johnny.
Morning, Ella.
Nervous.
How are you?
I'm... I'm all right, I guess.
What are you doing?
Looking at you.
Counting your scars.
Yeah.
Seeing how you've changed.
Oh, I mean, that's...
That's all I've changed, huh?
Just a little more beat up.
Oh, no.
You're just not...
Yeah, well...
Come on.
You want a drink or something?
No, thank you.
You have a lovely place.
Well, thank you.
Well, I've seen your house.
You have?
Yeah. When we, uh, played in Rome,
I stood a block away and watched your front gate for a couple hours.
I was just, uh, standing there wondering what your furniture looked like.
What you said to each other in the morning.
Yeah.
What's he like? What's he do?
Oh, he's a city engineer.
Ah.
We have a jet copter.
A son.
Two cats, and a place in the Alps.
Well, you don't really want hear all of this.
Son, huh?
Yes.
We have a lot of friends.
And he has a lover.
We have furniture a lot like yours.
Same taste in furniture, how about that?
Yes.
You know, Johnny.
All they want is a kind of incidental control over just a part of our lives.
I mean, they have control economically and politically, but they also provide.
You know they do.
Provide, huh?
You know, they were responsible for taking you away.
And I started to hate 'em.
They weren't.
It was the game, Johnny.
I mean, it was important to you.
It was as if I wasn't even there.
You played. There was nothing else.
I'm sorry.
You know I wanted you here.
I mean...
This might sound all wrong, but,
I mean, I was just trying to remember myself then.
Yeah.
Maybe it was love I wanted to try to remember.
There's, uh, a lot of things I want to talk to you about.
Yeah.
I've been thinking, Ella.
Been thinking a lot.
And watching.
It's like people who had a choice long time ago between having all them nice things or their freedom.
Of course, they, uh, chose comfort.
But comfort is freedom.
It always has been.
The whole history of civilization is a struggle against poverty and need.
No. No, that... That's not it.
That's never been it.
I mean, them privileges just buy us off.
Look.
They want me to quit, Ella.
Then quit.
Just like that, huh?
But you've got to do it now.
You've got to before it's too late.
Whether you want to or not.
Look, Johnny, the next game there won't be any substitutions allowed.
And no time limit.
You'll die, Johnny.
Everybody will die.
No time limit. They tell you that?
Yes.
They tell you to come here and convince me to quit?
Yes, but that isn't why I came here.
You have to get out for your own sake.
Oh, please, Johnny, please.
They tell you to stay if I did quit?
You my big reward?
You still don't understand why I came here.
You're the only person I ever wanted.
I wanted you on my side, that's all.
It's like you're a God now.
Maybe you know what I don't.
I...
I've been so stupid for so long.
I've been so stubborn.
I don't even know why.
It scares me.
You know, I'm probably gonna...
Probably gonna die.
And you'll be in here pumping away long after I'm gone.
Hey, you...
You got it made, old buddy.
Bluebonnets and everything.

No substitutions, no penalties, and no time limit.
All right, watch it now. He's got the ball, next time around we defend.
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!
Come on! Come on, get out of there!
Get him up!
He did it!
All right. That's right, get him in the elevator.
Get off the rail!
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!
- Come on!
- We gotta get him off the track.
I don't want another man on that track!
Houston, what the hell are you trying to do?
Nobody's gonna win this game!
Game? This wasn't meant to be a game!
Never!
- Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Houston! Houston!
Watch his leg. Watch that leg. Easy, easy.
Let me have him. Let me have him! Let me have him!
Move out. Move out.

This is com station Epsilon 9 calling USS Columbia.
Come in, Columbia.
Respond, please.
This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9.
Could you boost your transmission?
This is Epsilon 9, Columbia.
Am boosting output.
How read you this?
Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9.
Receiving your transmission.
Scout Columbia, NCC-621... to rendezvous with
Scout Revere, NCC-595... on stardate 7411.4.
Further orders will be relayed at that time.
Signed Commodore Prober to Starfleet.
- End of transmission.
- Received. Thank you.
Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-1 4.
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?
Unknown, Sir.
I have an exterior visual.
Attention!
Fire!
We've plotted a course on that cloud, Commander.
It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us.
Heading?
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.
Commander Sonak.
You received your appointment as Enterprise science officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Then why aren't you aboard?
Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here before...
- Here?
- we leave on our mission.
At Starfleet?
The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock.
Which will require
20 more hours at minimum...
Twelve.
I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura... which will not last more than three minutes.
Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Report to you, Sir?
It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting.
Report to me in one hour.
- Admiral!
- Mr. Scott.
Those departure orders... 12 hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters operating, Mr. Scott?
A wee problem, Sir.
Just temporary.
Admiral, we have just finished 18 months... redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.
How in hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours?
Take me over, please.
She needs more work, Sir.
A shakedown!
Mr. Scott, an alien object of unbelievable destructive power... is less than three days away from this planet.
The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise.
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.
The crew haven't had near enough transition time... with all the new equipment.
And the engines...
They're not even tested at warp power.
And an untried Captain.
Two-and-a-half years as chief of Starfleet Operations... may have made me a little stale, but I... wouldn't exactly consider myself untried.
- They gave her back to me, Scotty.
- Gave her back, Sir?
I doubt it was that easy with Nogura.
You're right.
Well, any man who could manage such a feat...
I would not dare disappoint.
She'll launch on time, Sir, and she'll be ready.
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, Sir.
Cargo bay to launch crew.
A travel pod is now available at dock 6.
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately.
Sir, you'll excuse me.
Flight deck, prepare for an incoming shuttlecraft.
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you...
I think I can find my way, Ensign.
Aye, Sir.
Bridge.
What's the problem?
I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago.
We did. We had to disconnect it.
All right. Take out...
It's going to take us longer that way. We're trying to save time.
I'm still waiting for a check on the line. What's holding it up?
As soon as somebody can get to it.
What's the next program?
I'll get somebody down there as soon as I can, Cleary.
My people are all tied up now.
Captain! Starfleet just signaled your transfer of command orders.
- Captain.
- I appreciate the welcome.
I wish the circumstances were less critical.
Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.
Aye, Sir.
- Where's Captain Decker?
- He's in Engineering, Sir.
He... He doesn't know.
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, Sir.
Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours.
I want to show them what we're facing.
Check Cleary on number six.
- Need your cooler status.
- Stand by.
Space matrix restoration coils.
Dilithium crystals.
I knew it. The transporter sensor was not activated.
Air equalization.
Automatic off.
Faulty module.
Cleary, put a new backup sensor into the unit.
Aye, Sir.
Admiral Kirk! Well, we're getting a top brass send-off.
Don't worry, she'll launch on schedule... if we have to tow her out with our bare hands, right, Scotty?
Aye. That we will, Sir.
- Let's talk.
- Sure.
Let me know when that backup's ready.
All due respect, I hope this isn't some kind of Starfleet pep talk.
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat.
You're what?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay on as executive officer.
Temporary grade reduction to Commander.
You personally are assuming command?
Yeah.
- May I ask why?
- My experience.
Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this.
My familiarity with the Enterprise and its crew.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new Enterprise.
You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard.
I'm sorry, Will.
No, Admiral,
I don't think you're sorry.
Not one damn bit.
I remember when you recommended me for this command.
You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped... you'd find a way to get a starship command again.
Well, Sir, it looks like you found a way.
Report to the bridge,
Commander, immediately.
Aye, Sir.
Transporter room!
Come in! Urgent!
Redline on the transporter,
Mr. Scott!
Transporter, do not engage!
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it! Pull them back!
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.
Give it to me.
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.
More signal!
- We're losing their pattern!
- Oh, no, they're forming.
Oh my God.
Starfleet, do you have them?
Enterprise, what we got back didn 't live long, fortunately.
Starfleet, Kirk.
Please express my condolences to their families.
Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan embassy.
There was nothing you could have done, Rand.
It wasn't your fault.
Yeoman, turboshaft 8?
Back that way, Sir.
We have to replace
Commander Sonak.
I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.
None available, Captain.
In fact, there's no one who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mr. Decker.
I'm afraid you're going to have to double as science officer.
That's all we know about it... except that it is now
53.4 hours away from Earth.
Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way.
Our orders are to intercept... investigate and take whatever action is necessary... and possible.
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon 9.
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, Sir.
Enterprise, the cloud is definitely a power field of some kind.
Measures... My God... over eight two AU's in diameter.
Must be something incredible inside there generating it.
We're transmitting lingua code friendship messages... on all frequencies.
No response. have a null reading at the center of the cloud.
Definitely something inside there, but scans are being reflected back.
- Some kind of power surge.
- Receiving an odd pattern now.
Enterprise, they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act.
They seem to be reactingto our scans, Sir.
Deflectors, emergency full!
- We are under attack.
- External view.
Viewer off.
Viewer off.
Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes.
Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally, Sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Reply we are holding position, awaiting final crew replacements.
Aye, Sir.
Transporter personnel reports... the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia...
She's already aboard and en route to the bridge, Sir.
She's Deltan, Captain.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, Sir.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
- Hello, Ilia.
- Decker.
I was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago.
Commander Decker?
Yes, our exec and science officer.
Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.
Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.
Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up.
Transporter room.
Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet...
Just a moment, Captain, Sir.
I'll explain what happened.
Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known... seldom-used reserve activation clause.
In simpler language, Captain, they drafted me!
They didn't.
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?
Bones, there's a thing out there.
Why is any object we don't understand always called a thing?
Headed this way. I need you.
Damn it, Bones, I need you.
Badly!
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted, Sir.
Well, Jim,
I hear Chapel's an MD now.
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse... not a doctor who will argue every little diagnosis with me.
And they probably redesigned the whole sick bay too!
I know engineers.
They love to change things.
Dock control reports ready, Sir.
- Helm ready, Sir.
- Orbital departure on plot, Sir.
Yard command signaling clear, Sir.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Sir.
Hold station.
Thrusters at station-keeping, Sir.
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.
Take us out.
Intermix set, Bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead warp .5.
Departure angle on viewer.
Departure angle.
- Viewer ahead.
- Viewer ahead.
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7412.6...
1.8 hours from launch.
In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time... we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system.
Captain, assuming we have full warp capability... accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system... will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours.
Science Officer competition.
Confirm, Sir
Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval?
They do not. It's like working in a damn computer center.
- Programming ready?
- Set for standard warp entry.
But I still recommend further simulation study.
Mr. Decker, every minute brings that object closer to Earth.
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.
Captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors.
Engineer, we need warp speed now!
Jim, you're pushing.
Your people know their jobs.
That's it, Sir.
I can't do any better.
Aye, lad.
It's borderline on the simulator.
I cannot guarantee she'll hold up.
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.
- Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu.
- Accelerating to warp 1, Sir.
Warp .7, .8.
Warp 1 , Sir.
Mr. Decker...
Wormhole. Get us back on impulse power. Full reverse.
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.
Subspace frequencies jammed, Sir!
Wormhole effect!
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds... before forward velocity slows to sublight speed.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us.
- Directly ahead.
- Force fields up full.
Put object on viewer.
- Go manual override on helm.
- No manual response, Sir.
Navigational deflectors coming up, Sir.
Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems.
Navigational deflectors inoperative, Captain.
Directional control also inoperative.
Time to impact?
Twenty seconds.
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.
No!
Belay that phaser order!
Arm photon torpedoes!
Photon torpedoes... armed!
Object is an asteroid.
Reading mass .7.
Targeting... asteroid!
Impact in ten seconds.
Impact in eight seconds.
- Fire torpedoes!
- Six!
Torpedoes away!
Five!
Helm control restored, Sir.
- Position report, Navigator.
- Computing new intersection course.
Communications are normal, Sir.
Negative damage reported, Captain.
No casualties reported, Doctor.
Wrong, Mr. Chekov.There are casualties.
My wits, as in
"frightened out of," Captain, Sir.
We were at warp .8.
Engineer, report your status there.
In just a second, Exec. We're picking up the pieces down here.
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible.
The engine imbalance created the wormhole in the first place.
It'll happen again if we don't correct it.
That object is less than two days away from Earth.
We need to intercept while it still is out there.
Lay in a heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
Mr. Decker.
-I'd like to see you in my quarters.
-Mind if I tag along, Captain?
Level 5.
All right, explanation. Why was my phaser order countermanded?
The Enterprise redesign increases phaser power... by channeling it through the main engines.
When they went into antimatter imbalance... the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, Sir.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, Sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker.
- Permission to speak freely, Sir?
- Granted.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two-and-a-half years.
That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign... in my opinion, Sir, seriously jeopardizes this mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties?
Yes, Sir, I'll do that.
Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander.
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, Sir.
He may be right, Jim.
- Was it difficult?
- No more than I expected.
About as difficult as seeing you again.
- I'm sorry.
- That you left Delta IV?
Or that you didn't even say good-bye?
If I had seen you again... would you have been able to say it?
No.
Make your point, Doctor.
The point, Captain, is that it's you who is competing.
You rammed getting this command down Starfleet's throat.
You've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back.
And I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying?
Yes.
It's an obsession.
An obsession that can blind you... to far more immediate and critical responsibilities.
Your reaction to Decker is an example, Jim.
- Bridge to Captain.
- Viewer on.
Signal from a Federation registered long-range shuttle, Sir.
She wishes to come alongside and lock on.
For what purpose?
My security scan shows it has a grade-one priority, Captain.
Non belligerency confirmed.
I suspect it is a courier of some kind.
Very well, Mr. Chekov.
See to it.
Viewer off.
Your opinion has been noted.
Anything further?
That depends on you.
Security scan.: one boarder.
Identity: Starfleet, inactive.
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.
Gran... ted.
Why... Why, it's Mister...
Spock!
Spock.
Commander, if I may?
If... Oh.
I've been monitoring your communications with Starfleet.
I'm aware of your engine design difficulties.
I offer my services as science officer... with all due respect,
Commander.
- If our exec has no objections.
- Of course not.
I'm well aware of
Mr. Spock's qualifications.
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.
List him as science officer.
Both effective immediately.
Mr. Spock.
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.
Captain, with your permission...
I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer.
Mr. Spock.
Welcome aboard.
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7413.4.
Thanks to Mr. Spock's timely arrival and assistance... we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity.
Repair time.: less than three hours.
Which means we will now be able to intercept intruder... while still more than a day from Earth.
Warp .8.
Warp 2, Sir.
Warp 3.
Warp 4.
Warp 5.
Warp 6.
Warp 7.
Science Officer Spock, reporting as ordered, Captain.
Please, sit down.
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.
You're just as warm and sociable as ever.
Nor have you, Doctor... as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates.
Gentlemen.
At last report, you were on Vulcan... apparently to stay.
Yes, you were undergoing the ''Kolanear'' discipline.
Sit down.
If you are referring to the
Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual... that's supposed to purge all remaining emotions.
The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us.
Will you, please, sit down?
On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered.
Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order.
I believe they emanate from the intruder.
I believe it may hold my answers.
Isn't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way?
Bones!
We need him.
I need him.
Then my presence is to our mutual advantage.
Any thought patterns you might sense... whether they appear to affect you personally or not...
I expect immediately reported.
Of course, Captain.
- Is there anything else?
- No.
Jim?
If this super intelligence... is as important to him as he says it is, how do we know...
That he wouldn't put his own interests ahead of the ship's?
I could never believe that.
Bridge to Officers' Lounge.
Captain Kirk.
Revised estimate on cloud visual contact.:3.7minutes.
Standard light, Engineer.
- Full mag on viewer.
- Full mag, Sir.
Lingua code?
Continuing friendship messages on all frequencies, Sir.
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status red.
Captain, we are being scanned.
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.
It could be misinterpreted as hostility.
Intruder scans emanating from the exact center of the cloud.
Energy of a type... never before encountered.
There's no response to friendship messages, Sir.
- Shall I go to battle stations?
- Negative.
We'll take no provocative action.
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.
No, Mr. Decker, that could also be misinterpreted as hostile.
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
- Twelfth-power energy field.
- Twelfth-power?
We've seen what their weapons can do.
Shouldn't we take every precaution?
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.
I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough...
Captain, as your exec it's my duty... to point out alternatives.
Yes, it is.
I stand corrected.
Five minutes to cloud boundary.
Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud center.
Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there.
Mr. Sulu, tactical plot on viewer.
Tactical on viewer, Sir.
That measures 12th-power energy?
Thousands of starships couldn't generate that much...
Mr. Spock?
Spock, tell me.
I sense... puzzlement.
We have been contacted.
Why have we not replied?
Contacted?
How?
Force fields up full.
Deflectors, now.
Force fields and deflectors up full, Captain.
Analysis, Mr. Spock.
Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy, Captain.
Exact composition unknown.
Guidance system unknown.
All decks, brace for impact.
Engineering, status report.
Systems overloading, Captain.
Medic.
Medics are coming.
Engineering to Bridge.
Cannot hold full power on force fields.
Deflector power is down 70 percent.
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.
Captain.
The intruder has been attempting to communicate.
I am now programming our computer... to transmit lingua code at their frequency and rate of speed.
Commander.
Spock!
Here it comes.
Engineering, what's happening to our force field?
Our shields cannot handle another attack.
Mr. Spock.
Impact in 20 seconds
Spock.
Fifteen seconds.
Spock, transmit now.
Ten seconds.
Transmitting.
It would seem our friendship messages... have been received and understood, Mr. Spock.
I would say that was a logical assumption, Captain.
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.
Holding present position, Sir.
Tactical plot on viewer.
Course projection on tactical, Sir.
Opinion, Mr. Spock.
Recommend we proceed, Captain.
- Mr. Decker?
- I advise caution, Captain.
We can't withstand another attack.
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.
- We know nothing about it as yet.
- Precisely the point, Captain.
We don't know what it'll do.
Moving into that cloud at this time... is an unwarranted gamble.
How do you define ''unwarranted''?
You asked my opinion, Sir.
Viewer. Standard ahead.
Navigator, maintain course.
Helmsman... steady as she goes.
No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude.
Spock.
Instruments fluctuating,
Captain.
Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.
Advise we are attempting further communication.
Unable to make contact with Starfleet, Captain.
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back.
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.
Reduce magnification factor four, Mr. Sulu.
We are already two settings below that, Sir.
Mr. Sulu... bring us into a parallel course... over the alien... at 500 meters.
Five hundred meters?
Then take us out to 100 kilometers distance... adjusting parallel course.
Aye, Sir.
Viewer astern.
Reverse angle on the view,
Captain.
Five hundred meters.
Viewer ahead, Sir.
Hold relative position here.
Mr. Spock!
Can that be one of their crew?
A probe from their vessel,
Captain.
Plasma-energy combination.
Don't interfere with it.
Absolutely, I will not interfere.
No one interfere.
It doesn't seem interested in us.
Only the ship.
Computer off.
It's taking control of the computer.
It's running our records...
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.
Ilia!
Ilia!
This is how I define ''unwarranted.''
Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff.
Captain, we've been seized by a tractor beam.
Get someone up here to take the navigator's station.
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.
- Emergency power.
- Going to full emergency.
But, Captain, if we don't break free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.
We cannot break free, Captain.
We have only a fraction of the power necessary.
Engineering, belay that order.
Disengage all main drive systems.
Chief DiFalco, take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.
DiFalco, disengage engine navigation relays now.
Aye, Sir.
Force field circuits
E-10 through 14... show ready for reactivation.
Confirm, please.
Scotty, drive systems should be free now.
Commander?
Ready to launch remote communications drone... with complete ship's records... including our present situation, Sir.
Delay launching as long as possible.
Our drone can't escape as long as we're held in their tractor.
Aye.
Captain, a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam... might weaken it just enough for us to break free.
Break free to where, Commander?
Any show of resistance would be futile, Captain.
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?
Why bring us inside?
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.
They still can.
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.
Insatiable curiosity.
Captain, photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing.
We're trapped, Sir.
Reverse angle on the viewer,
Captain.
Tractor beam has released us,
Captain.
Confirmed.
Vessel is floating free.
No forward momentum.
Viewer ahead.
Viewer ahead, Sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead one third.
Thrusters ahead one third.
Let's take a look.
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.
They can't expect us not to look them over now.
Now that we're looking down their throat.
Right, now that we've got them just where they want us.
It's closing up.
Hold position.
Captain.
All our scans are being reflected back.
Sensors are useless.
Damn.
What do you make of all this?
I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber... undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism.
I suspect it may be necess...
Intruder alert!
Deck 5. Officer's quarters.
Have Security meet me at deck 5, main elevator.
Spock.
Mr. Decker, you have the com.
Hold positions.
You are the Kirk unit.
You will assist me.
I have been programmed by V'Ger... to observe and record... normal functions of the carbon-based units... infesting USS Enterprise.
-Jim, what's going on?
- Tricorder.
Who is...
V'Ger?
V'Ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'Ger the name of the Captain of the alien vessel?
Jim.
This is a mechanism.
A probe, Captain.
No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination... recording everything we say and do.
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?
That unit no longer functions.
I've been given its form... to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units... infesting Enterprise.
Carbon-based units?
Humans, Ensign Perez.
Us.
Why does V'Ger travel... to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
To find the creator.
Find the creator?
Whose...
What does V'Ger want with the creator?
To join with him.
To join with the creator? How?
V'Ger and the creator will become one.
And who is the creator?
The creator is that which created V'Ger.
Who is V'Ger?
V'Ger is that which seeks the creator.
I'm ready to commence my observations.
Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe... might provide some insight into those who manufactured it... and how to deal with them.
Fine.
Let's get her to sick bay.
I'm programmed to observe and record... only the normal functioning of the carbon-based units.
The, uh... examination is a normal function.
You may proceed.
Micro-miniature hydraulics... sensors... and molecule-sized multiprocessor chips.
And take a look at this.
An osmotic micropump, right here.
Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated.
Every exocrine system is the same, too... even eye moisture.
Decker.
Fascinating.
Not ''Decker unit.''
Gentlemen.
Will.
- What happened to her?
- Captain.
This probe may be our key to the aliens.
- Probe? Ilia?
- Exactly.
It is a programmed mechanism,
Commander.
Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail.
Suppose that, beneath its programming... the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.
They may have followed it too precisely.
Ilia's memory... her feelings of loyalty, obedience, friendship... might all be there.
You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That probe, in another form, is what killed Ilia.
Commander...
Will, we're locked in an alien vessel... six hours from Earth's orbit.
Our only contact with our captor is that probe.
If we can control it, persuade it, use it...
I have recorded enough here.
You will now assist me further.
The, uh...
Decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency.
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.
Aye, Sir.
I am concerned with that being our only source of information, Captain.
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7414.1.
Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth.
No significant progress thus far... reviving Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe.
This remains our only means of contact with our captor.
All those vessels were called Enterprise.
The carbon units use this area for recreation.
This is one of the games.
What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?
The words ''recreation''... and ''enjoy''... have no meaning to my programming.
Ilia enjoyed this game.
She nearly always won.
Good. He's using audiovisual association.
This device serves no purpose.
Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units?
Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary... before carbon units can be patterned... for data storage.
What does that mean?
When my examination is complete... all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you... are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit.
If I can help you to revive those patterns... you could understand our functions better.
That is logical.
You may proceed.
I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that.
On Delta.
Remember?
Ilia.
Dr. Chapel.
Will?
Ilia.
Commander.
Commander.
This is a mechanism.
Ilia... help us make direct contact with V'Ger.
I cannot.
This creator V'Ger is looking for... what is it?
V'Ger does not know.
Computer, commence recording.
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail my attempt... to contact the aliens.
I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate... to coincide with the opening of the V'Ger orifice.
This should facilitate a better view... of the interior of the alien spacecraft.
Captain, Starfleet signals are growing in strength, Sir.
They still have the intruder on their monitors.
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, Sir.
Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit.
Sir, air lock 4 has been opened.
A thruster suit is reported missing.
A thruster suit?
That's Spock.
Damn him.
Bring him back here.
No, wait.
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, Sir.
I have successfully penetrated... the next chamber of the alien's interior... and I'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image... which I believe to be a representation... of V'Ger's home planet.
I'm passing through a connecting tunnel.
Apparently, a kind of plasma-energy conduit.
Possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system.
Curious.
I'm seeing images of planets, moons, stars... whole galaxies all stored here, recorded.
It could be a representation of V'Ger's entire journey.
But who or what... are we dealing with?
The Epsilon 9 station, stored here with every detail.
Captain, I am now quite convinced... that all of this is V'Ger... that we are inside a living machine.
Ilia.
The sensor... must contain some special meaning.
I must try to mind-meld with it.
Spock.
Spock!
Spock.
Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection.
Indications of some neurological trauma.
The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering.
Spock.
Jim.
I should have known.
Were you right... about V'Ger?
A life-form of its own.
A conscious, living entity.
A living machine?
It considers the Enterprise a living machine.
That's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.
I saw V'Ger's planet.
A planet populated by living machines.
Unbelievable technology.
V'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe.
And yet... with all its pure logic...
V'Ger is barren... cold.
No mystery.
No beauty.
Should have known.
Known?
Known what? Spock.
What should you have known?
What should you have known?
Jim... this... simple feeling... is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.
No meaning, no hope.
Jim... no answers.
It's asking questions.
''Is this... all that I am?
Is there nothing more?''
Bridge to Captain.
Kirk here.
A faint signal from Starfleet, Sir.
Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors... for the past 27 minutes.
Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches.
Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed.
We are three minutes from Earth orbit.
I'll be right there.
I need Spock on the bridge.
Dalaphaline, five cc's.
A machine planet... sending a machine to Earth.. looking for its creator.
It's absolutely incredible.
Mr. Chekov.
Commander Decker present location.
They are in the engineering, Sir.
Captain, Starfleet is sending this tactical on V'Ger's position.
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.
Jim.
From V'Ger.
V'Ger signals the creator.
Spock?
A simple binary code... transmitted by carrier wave signal.
Radio.
Radio?
Jim.
V'Ger expects an answer.
An answer?
I don't know the question.
The creator has not responded.
All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative.
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding... toward equidistant positions orbiting the planet.
They're the same things that hit us.
They are hundreds of times more powerful, Captain.
From those positions... they could devastate the entire surface of the planet.
Why?
The creator has not answered.
The carbon unit infestation is to be removed from the creator's planet.
Why?
You infest Enterprise.
You interfere with the creator in the same manner.
V'Ger
V'Ger
Captain.
V'Ger is a child.
I suggest you treat it as such.
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.
A child... evolving, learning, searching... instinctively needing.
- Needing what?
- Spock.
This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth.
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.
But, like so many of us... it does not know what.
The carbon units know why the creator has not responded.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Captain.
I'm losing Starfleet.
Interference from V'Ger.
Kirk unit, disclose the information.
Why has the creator not responded?
No.
Secure all stations.
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge, Captain?
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir.
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.
V'Ger requires the information.
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.
Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this?
All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise... the information that V'Ger requires will also be destroyed.
It is illogical to withhold required information.
Kirk unit!
Kirk unit.
Why do you not disclose information?
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all carbon units on the third planet.
They have repressed the creator.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'Ger needs the information.
Then V'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices.
V'Ger will comply... if the carbon units will disclose the information.
It learns fast, doesn't it?
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger... obviously operates from a central brain complex.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point, then.
Precisely.
The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe... but only to V'Ger directly.
Forward motion, Captain.
Tractor beam.
Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker... is there a next move?
Resume duty stations.
All personnel, resume stations.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff has been called.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices reach final position?
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.
Captain, I believe that is our destination.
Forward motion slowing, Captain.
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise.
Forward motion stopped, Captain.
V'Ger.
Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal.
It's directly ahead.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its creator.
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger... with the required information.
Mr. Spock. Bones.
Mr. Decker, I will contact you every five minutes.
Captain.
I'd like to go along.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
V'Ger.
''V... G-E-R.''
V'Ger.
''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.''
Voyager.
Voyager 6.
NASA. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Jim... this was launched more than 300 years ago.
Voyager series.
Designed to collect data... and transmit it back to Earth.
Captain...
Voyager 6 disappeared into what they used to call a black hole.
It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy... and fell into the machine planet's gravitational field.
The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind... primitive, yet kindred.
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming... collect all data possible.
Learn all that is learnable.
Return that information to its creator.
Precisely, Mr. Decker.
The machines interpreted it literally.
They built this entire vessel... so that Voyager could actually fulfill its programming.
And on its journey back... it amassed so much knowledge... it achieved consciousness itself.
It became a living thing.
Kirk unit.
V'Ger awaits the information.
Enterprise... order up the ship's computer library records... on the late 20th-century
NASA probe Voyager 6.
Specifically, we want the old NASA code signal... that instructs the probe to transmit its data.
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
-Aye, Sir.
That's what it's been signaling... its readiness to transmit its information.
And there's no one on Earth... who could recognize the old signal and send a response.
The creator does not answer.
V'Ger.
V'Ger.
V'Ger!
We are the creator.
That is not logical.
Carbon units are not true life-forms.
We will prove it.
We will make it possible for you to complete your programming.
Only the creator could accomplish that.
Enterprise?
We have just received the response code, Captain.
Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency... and transmit the code now.
Transmitting. and the final sequence.
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.
Voyager is not transmitting its data, Captain.
The creator must join with V'Ger.
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.
The creator must join with V'Ger.
Voyager is not transmitting,
Captain... because it did not receive the final sequence.
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.
Enterprise, stand by.
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.
By V'Ger itself.
- Why?
- To prevent reception.
Of course.
To bring the creator here.
To finish transmitting the code in person.
To touch the creator.
Capture God?
V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment.
Perhaps not, Doctor.
Captain.
V'Ger must evolve.
Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe. It must evolve.
What it requires of its god, Doctor, is the answer to its question...
Is there nothing more?
What more is there than the universe, Spock?
Other dimensions.
Higher levels of being.
The existence of which cannot be proven logically.
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve... is a human quality... our capacity to leap beyond logic.
Joining with its creator might accomplish that.
You mean this machine wants to physically join with a human?
Is that possible?
Let's find out.
Decker.
I'm gonna key the final sequence through the ground test computer.
You don't know what that'll do to you!
Yes, I do, Doctor.
Decker, don't.
Jim, I want this.
As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this.
Captain.
Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life-form?
Yes, Captain.
We witnessed a birth.
Possibly a next step in our evolution.
I wonder.
Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby.
I hope we got this one off to a good start.
I hope so too.
I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose... out of our own human weaknesses... and the drive that compels us to overcome them.
And a lot of foolish human emotions.
Right, Mr. Spock?
Quite true, Doctor.
Unfortunately, it will have to deal with them as well.
Interrogative from Starfleet.
They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status.
Report two casualties.
Lieutenant Ilia.
Captain Decker.
- Aye, Sir.
- Correction.
They're not casualties.
They...
List them as missing.
Vessel status: fully operational.
Aye, Sir.
Mr. Scott, shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown?
I would say it's time for that, Sir, aye.
We can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock.
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.
My task on Vulcan is completed.
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1 .
- Warp 1 , Sir.
- Heading, Sir?
Out there.
That away.
Part Two
STALKER
Where are you?
Come here!
Are you tired?
Oh, God!
Judging by his tone, he's going to start sermonizing again.
Let everything that's been planned come true.
Let them believe.
And let them have a laugh at their passions.
Because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy, but just the friction between their souls and the outside world.
And most important, let them believe in themselves let them be helpless like children, because weakness is a great thing, and strength is nothing.
When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible, when he dies, he is hard and insensitive.
When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant, but when it's dry and hard, it dies.
Hardness and strength are death's companions.
Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being.
Because what has hardened will never win.
Come here!
We're progressing well.
Soon we'll come to a dry tunnel, after that it will get easier.
Knock on wood.
- Are we on our way already?
- Of course. Why? l thoughtyou just wanted to show us something.
- What about my knapsack?
- What about it? l left it there. l didn't know we were going.
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- No, we have to go back.
- lt's impossible!
- l can't do without my knapsack!
Can'tyou understand that no one here has ever come back the same way?
Forget aboutyour knapsack.
What have you got there, diamonds?
The room will give you anything you want.
Really. lt will drown you in knapsacks.
Howfar is it, this room? lf you go straight, about 200 meters, but there's no going straight here.
Let's go.
Give up your empiricism, Professor.
Miracles are outside empiricism.
Remember how St. Peter was nearly drowned?
Go, Writer.
Go where?
Up these stairs.
Professor, where are you?
Here is the dry tunnel!
You call it dry?
This is a local joke.
Normally one has to swim here.
Wait, where's Professor?
- What?
- Professor has disappeared!
How could it happen?
He was following you all the way.
He probably lagged behind and lost his way.
No, he didn't lose his way!
He must've gone for the knapsack!
He won't be able to make it now.
Shall we wait for him?
We can't. Things change here every minute. We'll have to go.
Look! What is it? How could it be?
- l already explained.
- What did you explain? lt's the Zone, don'tyou understand?
Let's go, quick. lt's...
There he is! l'm certainly grateful to you thatyou... but...
How did you get here?
Mostly l had to crawl up here on my fours. lncredible.
How did you manage to overtake us?
What do you mean, ''overtake''? l came back here for the knapsack.
And how has our nut gotten here?
Oh, my God, that's... the trap!
Porcupine put this nut here on purpose.
How could the Zone let us through?
Oh God, l'm not going to take one more step until... l don't like it.
That's it! We rest!
But keep off this nut, just in case.
Sorry, but l thought that
Professor won't be able to make it.
You see, l... l never know beforehand what kind of people l'm taking with me.
Everything gets clear only here, when it's too late.
What's important is that Professor's bag with his underwear is safe.
Don't stick your nose in someone's underwear if you don't understand it.
What is there to understand?
Binomial theorem?
Some psychological abysses!
You have a bad reputation atyour institute.
They don't give you money for an expedition.
So you decide to pack a knapsack full of manometers and other shit... penetrate the Zone illegally... and put all these miracles to an algebra test.
No one in the world has ever heard of the Zone.
So we'll work a sure sensation!
The television, fans raving and bringing laurel wreaths.
Here our Professor appears, all in white, and declares:
''Mene-mene, tekel, uprasin.''
Everyone gaping and shouting:
''He deserves a Nobel Prize!''
You lousy scribbler, a homespun psychoanalyst.
You're only good for painting walls in public toilets, you blabbermouth.
No good. Too sluggish.
You don't know howto do it.
All right. l'm going to get a Nobel Prize.
And what are you after?
Want to bless mankind with the pearls of your purchased inspiration? l don't care a damn about mankind.
Of all your mankind l'm interested only in one man - myself.
Whether l'm worth anything or l'm just shit like others.
And if you find out thatyou're really...
You know, Mr. Einstein, l have no wish to argue with you.
Truth is born of argument, damn it!
Listen, Chingachgook...
You've brought here many people.
Not as many as l would like.
That's not the point. Why did they come here? What did they want?
Happiness, l guess.
Yes, but what kind of happiness?
People don't like to speak about their innermost feelings.
And it's neither yours nor mine business. ln any case, you've been lucky.
As for me, l haven't seen one happy man in my life.
Me neither.
They return from the room and l lead them back, and we never see each other again. lt's not that wishes come true immediately.
Have you ever wished to use this room yourself? l'm fine as l am.
Listen, Professor.
Speaking of the purchased inspiration.
Let's imagine that l enter this room and return to our God-forsaken town a genius.
A man writes because he's tormented, because he doubts.
He needs to constantly prove to himself and the others that he's worth something.
And if l knowfor sure that l'm a genius?
Why write then?
What the hell for?
Well, l must say that we exist for...
Will you be so kind and leave me alone?
Let me get a wink, l haven't slept all night.
Keep your complexes to yourself. ln any case, all this technology of yours... all those blast furnaces, wheels... and other bullshit are only designed in order to work less and eat more.
They are all just crutches, artificial limbs.
And mankind exists in order to create... works of art.
Unlike all other human activities, this one is unselfish.
Great illusions! lmages of the absolute truth!
Are you listening to me, Professor?
What unselfishness are you talking about?
People still die of hunger.
Have you fallen from the moon?
And they are considered to be our brainy aristocracy!
You're not even capable of thinking in abstractions.
Are you going to teach me about the meaning of life?
And also howto think? lt's useless. You might be a professor, but an ignorant one.
And there was a great earthquake.
And the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair.
And the moon became like blood...
And the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up.
And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich and the chiliarchs and the strong and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains; and they said to the mountains and to the rocks, ''Fall on us and hide us from the presence of
Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?''
And that very day two... two of them... were going to a village which was about 60 stadia from... named... and they were conversing with each other about all these things.
And while they were conversing and discussing...
He Himself approached, and began travelling with them.
But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.
And He said to them:
''What are these words... you are exchanging with one another, and why are you sad?''
And one of them, named...
Are you awake?
You were speaking of the meaning... of our... life... of the unselfishness of art...
Take music, for instance.
Less than anything else, it is connected to reality, or if connected at all, it's done mechanically, not by way of ideas, just by a sheer sound, devoid of... any associations.
And yet, music, as if by some miracle, gets through to our heart.
What is it that resonates in us in response to noise brought to harmony, making it the source of the greatest delight which stuns us and brings us together?
What's all this needed for?
And most important, who needs it?
You would say,
''No one. And for no reason.''
Unselfishly.
No. l don't think so.
After all, everything has some sense.
Sense and reason.
Do we have to go there?
Unfortunately, yes.
There's no other way. lt looks morbid, don'tyou think,
Professor? l don't feel like going there first.
And Chingachgooks can never be volunteers. l think we'll have to draw lots.
Do you mind?
For this, l would rather have a volunteer.
Have you got matches?
Thanks.
The long one will go.
Pull it.
The long one.
No luck this time.
Why don'tyou throw one of your nuts at least?
Sure. As you wish.
One more?
All right... l'll go.
Hurry up, Professor!
There's... There's a door here!
Go that way!
Open the door and go in!
Me again?
Do l have to go in first again?
You've drawn the lot.
Go! People don't wait here.
What have you got there?
No guns here!
You'll have yourself killed, and us too!
Don'tyou remember the tanks?
Drop it, l beg you.
Don'tyou understand? lf something happens, l can save you, but not this way... l beg you!
Who are you going to fire at?
Go, we haven't got much time!
There's water here!
Hold on to the handrail and go down.
But don't go anywhere!
Wait for us outside! l hope you haven't got anything like that?
- Like what?
- Like a gun.
No. As a last resort l've got an ampule.
- What ampule?
- lmplanted ampule. Poison!
Oh, God! Did you come here to die?
No, it's just in case.
Writer! Come back!
Come back! You want to getyourself killed? l told you to wait by the exit!
Stop! Don't move!
That's all your pipe.
- Why?
- You should've gone in there first.
He was so scared that he went the wrong way.
One more experiment.
Experiments, facts, truth of the highest instance.
There's no such thing as facts.
Especially here.
All this is someone's idiotic invention.
Don'tyou feel it?
Butyou, of course, must find out whose invention it is.
And why.
What good can your knowledge do?
Who is going to get guilty conscience because of it? Me? l've got no conscience. l just got nerves.
Some bastard would criticize me, l get wounded.
Another would loud me, l get wounded again. l would put my heart and soul in it, they gobble up both my heart and soul. l would relieve my soul of filth, they gobble it up too.
They're all so literate.
They all got sensory deficiency.
And they're all swarming around, journalists, editors, critics, some endless broads.
And they all demand: more, more!
What hell of a writer am l if l hate writing? lf it's constant torment for me, a painful, shameful occupation, sort of squeezing out a hemorrhoids. l used to think that someone would get better because of my books.
No, nobody needs me! ln two days after l die they'll start gobbling up someone else. l wanted to change them, but it's they who've changed me.
Making me in their own image.
The future used to be just a continuation of the present, with all the changes looming far behind the horizon.
Nowthe future and the present are one.
Are they ready for it?
They don't want to know anything!
All they know is howto gobble!
Gosh, how lucky you are!
My goodness, now...
You're going to live a hundred years!
Yes. But why not forever?
Like the eternal Jew.
You are probably a fine man. l almost didn't doubt it. l can imagine what torture it was for you being in there.
This pipe is a horrible place!
The most horrible in the Zone! lt's called ''the meat mincer'', but it's much worse than any mincer.
So many people perished there!
Porcupine sent his brother to die there.
The boy was so delicate, very talented.
Here, listen to this.
So summer is gone,
Leaving no epitaph. lt's still warm in the sun,
Only that's not enough.
All that true could have come,
Like a five-fingered fluff,
Folded into my palm,
Only that's not enough.
No evil was slighted ln the good aftermath,
World was festively lighted,
Only that's not enough.
Life forever was tucking,
Caring, making me laugh. l was really lucky,
Only that's not enough.
No leaves ever seared,
No limbs broken rough.
Day, like glass, washed all clear,
Only that's not enough.
Good, aren't they?
That's his verses.
Why do you fidget?
Fussing all the time?
- l'm just...
- l get sick just looking atyou! l'm so happy! lt's not often that everyone who goes makes it.
You did everything right.
You're good, kind, honest people. l'm proud that l was right aboutyou.
Look at him! He's happy that everything ended well!
Fate! Zone! l'm a fine man, he says!
You think l didn't see how you shoved the two long matches at me?
- No, you don't understand...
- Of course, how could l? l'm sorry, Professor, no offense meant, but this jerk has chosen you to be his favorite.
Come on, it's unfair!
And me, a second-rate creature, he shoves into that pipe!
Meat mincer! To think of such a word!
What right have you got to decide who is to live and who is to go into the meat mincer?
You've chosen ityourself!
What? One long match out of the two long ones?
The matches are nothing.
The Zone had letyou through earlier, under the nut, so it became clear that only you could go through the meat mincer.
And we just followed you.
Well, it's too much...
You can't even imagine how dangerous it is to make a mistake here.
But someone had to be first!
Yes? No, it's not a clinic!
You see, someone has to go first!
Don't touch it!
Laboratory nine, please.
Just a minute.
- Hello?
- l hope l'm not disturbing you.
- What do you want?
- Just a few words with you.
You've hidden it. l've found it.
The old building. Bunker four.
Do you hear me? l'm alerting the security immediately.
You may do it.
You may inform on me, you may set my colleagues against me, but it's too late. l'm now at a stone's throw from that place.
Do you realize that's the end of you as a scientist?
Well, you may rejoice!
Do you realize what will happen if you dare?
Trying to scare me again?
All my life l've been afraid of something. Even of you.
But now l'm not afraid of anything, l assure you.
Oh God, you are not even a Herostratos. lt's just thatyou've always wanted to make my life unbearable because twenty years ago l slept with your wife.
And now you're delighted thatyou've made even with me.
Well, go and do your... vile thing.
Don'tyou dare hang up on me!
Prison is not the worst thing expecting you.
The worst is thatyou'll never be able to forgive yourself for this. l already see you hanging from your suspenders in your prison cell.
What are you up to, Professor?
Do you realize what will happen when everybody believes in the room?
And all come rushing here? lt's only a question of time. lf not today, then tomorrow!
And not just tens of them, thousands!
Unfulfilled emperors, great inquisitors, fuhrers, self-appointed benefactors of the human race!
And they'll come not for money or inspiration, but to change the world! l never take here people like that.
You think l don't understand it?
What on earth can you understand?
You're not the only stalker on Earth.
No stalker can know what those you lead bring with them and what they take from here.
And the number of unmotivated crimes is on the rise! lsn't thatyour doing?
Take coups d'etat by the military, or the mafia penetrating governments, aren't they all your clients?
Or lasers and all those super-bacteria, all that filth, kept for the time being in safes?
Will you please stop this sociological diarrhea?
Can you really believe in all those fairy tales?
Not in the good ones, no!
But in the bad ones, certainly!
Come on!
A human being is not capable of such hatred or love... that would extend over the whole of mankind.
Well, money, a woman, maybe a desire for revenge, let my boss be overrun by a car, that l can understand.
But ruling over the world!
A just society!
God's kingdom on earth!
These are not just wishes, this is ideology, action, concepts.
Unconscious compassion is not ready for realization yet.
As a regular instinctive impulse.
There cannot be happiness at someone else's expense. l can see quite clearly now thatyou plan to overwhelm mankind with good deeds.
As for me, l'm not a bit worried aboutyou or myself, and least of all about mankind.
Because you're not going to achieve anything.
At bestyou'll getyour Nobel Prize.
Or rather you'll get something absolutely incongruous, something you don't even think about.
Something like this telephone...
You dream of one thing, butyou get quite another.
Why did you do that?
Telephone... electricity...
Look, very good sleeping pills.
They don't make ones like that any longer. Why so many of them here?
Maybe we'd better be going? lt will be dark soon, difficult to come back.
By the way, it's absolutely clear to me that all this poem reciting and making detours is just a form of apologizing. l can understand you.
Difficult childhood, bad environment...
But don't have any illusions, l'm not going to forgive you.
Will you please stop it, do me a favor.
Professor, come here, please.
Wait a minute.
Don't be in a hurry. l'm in no hurry whatsoever. l know, you're going to get mad.
Anyway, l must tell you...
We are now... on the threshold...
This is the most important moment in your life.
You must knowthat...
Your innermost wishes will be made real here.
Your most sincere wish!
Born of suffering!
No need to say anything.
You just have to... concentrate and try to recall your whole life.
When a man thinks of the past, he becomes kinder.
And most important...
Most important...
You have to believe!
Now you can go.
Who wants to be the first?
Maybe, you?
Me? No, l don't want to. l understand, it's not easy, but it will pass. l doubt... that it will pass. lf l begin recalling my life, it's very unlikely l'll get any kinder.
Besides, don'tyou feel how shameful the whole thing is?
Humiliating yourself, sniveling, praying?
What's so bad in praying? lt's justyour pride speaking.
Calm down, you're not ready yet. lt happens quite often.
Maybe, you first?
Yes, me.
We see before us
Professor's new invention!
An appliance exploring human souls!
Soulmeter! lt's only a bomb.
What?
You must be kidding.
No, it's just a bomb.
Twenty kilotons.
What for?
We had it assembled with my friends.
With my former colleagues.
This place will never bring any happiness to anyone.
But if this thing gets into the wrong hands...
Though, l'm not sure any more.
We came to the conclusion then... that we shouldn't destroy the Zone after all.
Even if it's some miracle, it's still part of nature, and therefore, a hope in a sense.
They had hidden that bomb, and l've found it.
The old building, bunker four. l guess there must be a principle...
Never do anything that can't be undone. l understand everything, l'm not some maniac.
But as long as this plague lies in the open, accessible to any scum, l can get no peace, no sleep.
Or maybe, my innermost won't let me do it?
Poor man, some problem he's invented for himself.
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
You're a civilized man, aren'tyou?
- Why? What's the matter with you?
- You, lousy hypocrite...
Why?
What have l done... to you?
He wants to destroy your hope!
That's all people have got left on this earth! lt's the only place they can come to, if there's no hope left for them.
You yourself have come here!
Why destroy hope then?
Shut up! l can see through you!
You don't give a damn about people!
You just make money, using our... anguish! lt's not even the money.
You're enjoying yourself here.
You're like God Almighty here.
You, a hypocritical louse, decide who is to live and who is to die.
He deliberates!
Now l see why you stalkers never enter the room yourselves.
You revel in all that power, that mystery, your authority!
What else is there to wish for? lt's not true!
You... you're mistaken.
A stalker must not enter the room.
A stalker must not even enter the Zone with an ulterior motive.
Remember Porcupine?
Yes, you're right, l'm a louse. l haven't done any good in this world, and l can't do any. l couldn't give anything even to my wife. l can't have any friends either.
But don't take mine from me!
They'd already taken everything from me back there, behind the barbed wire.
So all that's mine is here.
You understand? Here! ln the Zone!
My happiness, my freedom, my self-respect, it's all here! l bring here people like me, desperate and tormented.
People who have nothing else to hope for.
And l can help them!
No one else can help them, only l, the louse, can! l'm so happy to be able to help them that l want to cry.
And that's all. l don't want anything more. l don't know. Maybe.
Anyway, excuse me, but...
You're just a God's fool.
You have no idea what's going on here.
Why do you think Porcupine hanged himself?
He came to the Zone with a mercenary motive.
He made his brother die in the meat mincer because of money. l know.
But why did he hang himself?
Why didn't he come here again, not for money, but for his brother? ln way of repenting.
He wanted to... l don't know.
He hanged himself a week later.
Because he realized that not just any wish comes true here, but only your innermost wish.
Not what would you holler at the top of your voice...
Coming true here is only what's in line with your nature, with your essence, of which you know nothing.
But it's there, in you, directing you all your life.
You didn't understand anything,
Leather Stocking. lt wasn't greed that had done
Porcupine in.
He was crawling in this puddle, begging to bring his brother back.
But what he got was only money, and he couldn't get anything else, because render unto Porcupine the things that are Porcupine's!
And things like conscience, anguish, they are just inventions.
He realized that and hanged himself. l'm not going to your room. l have no wish to pour my filth over somebody's head.
Even yours.
And then to put my neck into the noose, like Porcupine. l'd rather drink myself to death in my mansion, in peace and quiet.
You don't understand anything about human beings, Chingachgook, if you take to the Zone people like me.
And something else...
Why do you think that this miracle really exists?
Who told you that wishes actually come true here?
Have you seen a single man who's been made happy here?
Was it Porcupine?
As a matter of fact, who told you about the Zone, about Porcupine, about that room?
He did.
Then it makes no sense to me at all.
What's the use coming here? lt's so quiet...
Can you feel it?
What the heck... Why not chuck it all, take my wife, Monkey, and move over here.
For good.
There's no one here.
No one can hurt them here.
So you're back.
Where did you get this?
He got attached to me. l couldn't leave him there.
Well, shall we go?
Monkey is waiting.
Are you coming?
Does any one of you need a dog? l've got five of them at home.
So you love dogs, don'tyou?
What?
That's very good.
All right, let's go.
You can't even imagine howtired l am!
God only knows!
Calling themselves intellectuals, those writers and scientists!
Don't get so excited.
They don't believe in anything!
They've got the organ with which one believes atrophied for lack of use.
Stop it. Come on.
Go to bed. Don't lie here... lt's too damp here for you...
You shouldn't lie here.
Take it off.
Oh God, what people...
Calm down, it's not their fault.
You ought to pity them, not to be angry with them.
Haven'tyou seen them? They've got empty eyes.
The only thing they can think about is howto sell themselves not too cheap!
Howto get as much as possible for their every emotional movement!
They knowthey were ''born for a purpose'', ''called upon''!
After all, they live ''only once''!
Can people like that believe in anything?
Stop it, calm down.
Try to sleep, will you?
Go to sleep.
And nobody believes.
Not only those two. Nobody!
Who am l going to take there?
Oh, God...
And what's most awful... is that no one needs it.
No one needs that room.
And all my efforts are just in vain.
Why do you say that?
Stop it. l'm not going there with anybody again.
Do you want me to go with you?
Where?
You think l've got nothing to ask for?
No...
You can't go there.
Why not?
No, no.
What if it wouldn't work with you, either?
You know, my mother was against it.
You've probably noticed already that he's not of this world.
All our neighborhood laughed at him.
He was such a bungler, he looked so pitiful.
My mother used to say:
''He's a stalker, he's doomed, he's an eternal prisoner!
Don'tyou know what kind of children the stalkers have?''
And l... l didn't even argue with her. l knew it all myself, that he was doomed, that he was an eternal prisoner, and about the children.
Only what could l do? l was sure l would be happy with him.
Of course, l knew l'd have a lot of sorrow, too.
But it's better to have a bitter happiness than... a gray, dull life.
Perhaps, l thought it all up later.
But then he approached me and said:
''Come with me.''
And l did, and never regretted it.
Never.
We had a lot of sorrow, a lot of fear, and a lot of shame.
But l never regretted it, and l never envied anyone. lt's just our fate, our life, that's how we are.
And if we haven't had our misfortunes, we wouldn't have been better off. lt would have been worse.
Because in that case, there wouldn't have been any happiness.
And there wouldn't have been any hope. l love your eyes, my darling friend,
Their play, so passionate and bright'ning,
When a sudden stare up you send,
And like a heaven-blown lightning, lt'd take in all from end to end.
But there's more that l admire:
Your eyes when they're downcast ln bursts of love-inspired fire,
And through the eyelash goes fast
A somber, dull call of desire...
The End
(Guide) Watch your step.
Watch your step, please.
Hispanic Tours, this way, please.
Follow my hand.
- No, no, no.
- The usual postcards! (Laughs)
- Photos, photos.
- No, thanks. I'll take my own.
Follow me.
This way. This way, please!
All right.
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
Keeping close, please.
Come along, move in close, please.
Here we have, ladies and gentlemen, a unique example of Medieval Christian art.
This representation of the devil carrying off the dead, goes far beyond the formalized art of its day.
Look closely.
The face of Satan expresses a quality, which reflects the very soul of pleasure in evil.
The devil seems a presence so strong and overpowering, that this painting has led to a local superstition.
The people of this region believe that it is only the power of the devil himself, which has kept this fresco from ruin.
- Listen, I'll be right back, OK?
- Lisa, where are you going?
- Wait for me there, all right?
- Yeah, well, hurry back.
(Guide) ...balanced between the figures of the living and of the dead.
(Man) Hm, the eyes, Maestro.
(Shopkeeper) Sí, señor?
(Man) I would add a few wrinkles and age them a bit more, hm?
- His attire, Maestro.
- Hm?
A bit severe, isn't it?
Well, I think this black here would be better, you know, because then you could use it on all occasions - for funerals, weddings, whenever you like.
- Hm, you have a point.
- Oh, I'll trim the mustache a little.
(clears throat) Excuse me, but how much are you asking for this?
It's not for sale.
It belongs to the gentleman here.
Oh.
(Man) Do you think black is too severe, Miss?
(Man) Strange, how strange.
You'd think the girl had seen the devil!
Excuse me, sir, could you tell me...
No, wait!
Sir, the main square...
Señora!
Excuse me, señora, but I'm Lost.
Can you tell me where the main square is? brain and mouth agape.
You're a dummy, is what you are.
Ah, is she the Lady we met in the shop?
- Hello, Miss.
- Excuse me, I... I... I'm Lost.
Can you... Can you tell me where the main square is?
- (Gasps)
- Come back here! (Chuckles)
Excuse me.
The square, what square?
Well, the one...
Well, the one where the painting is, the, er, fresco of the devil carrying away the dead.
Ah!
That way.
Good day, Miss.
Good day.
Darling!
- Elena.
- (Whimpers softy)
Why do you Look at me like that?
- No...
- You knew that I'd come back to you,
- that someday we'd find each other again.
- No, don't...
You must have known that I would have come back.
- No! No!
- No, Elena!
- Let me go! No!
- (Screams)
Help!
He... help!
Hey!
(Man) What is it now?
(Driver) I don't know, sir.
(Man) You're a chauffeur...
(Driver) Yes, sir.
I'm not a mechanical engineer.
(Woman) Must you use that tone?
(Man) please!
- please, open! please!
- (Man) What's the matter?
Excuse me, but I'm a tourist, and I've Lost my way.
(Man) All right...
- (Man) George!
- Yes?
(Man) We'll give this young Lady a lift.
(George) We will if we can get started.
(Man) May I know what's wrong with the car?
It's the upper hose. It's Losing water, sir.
It should be repaired.
Let's go on.
(Man) Why are you slowing down?
(George) It's not me, it's the car, sir.
(Man) Listen, George, do you have to stop right here in the middle of nowhere?
It's not up to me, sir.
If it's boiling over, we can't go much further, not without burning out the motor.
(Woman) You and your foreign cars.
What do we do now? Wait for parts to come in from the factory?
(Man) Stop that, will you?
How do you open these?
George?
- (George) Madam.
- Next time, listen to me.
(Woman) Thank you, George.
(George) Madam.
(Woman) How Long will it take?
(George) If we had a hose, a few minutes.
(Woman) Can't you fix it?
(George) I could try.
(Woman) please, George.
(Man) Oh, er, good evening. I, er...
I'm very sorry to bother you but we've had some trouble with the car.
The water hose is Leaking and we'll need a mechanic.
(Woman) Leandro!
(Man) I reallse it's Late, but if we could use your phone and get in touch with a garage...
(Woman) Leandro!
I'm sorry, there is no telephone here.
We have so little use for it, you see.
- (Woman) Send them away!
- Yes, my Lady, certainty!
(Man) Is there a hotel nearby?
No, not in the immediate vicinity.
Oh, there are a few roadside inns, but their accommodations would hardy meet with your approval.
(Man) I see.
(Leandro) Coming, my Lady!
(Woman) Oh, this is awful.
(Man) Yes, it's a dreadful night.
Please stay.
Don't go away.
(Man) Where could we find one of these roadside inns?
No, no, no, please, don't go away.
My mother's not used to visitors.
We live atone.
But please, please come in.
(Woman) Maximilian, what's keeping you?
Excuse me, I'll... only be a moment.
Mother.
Tell them to go,
Maximilian, dear, listen to me.
W... we're always so atone.
It'll only be for one night.
Mother, please.
She...
They've no place to go.
Only for one night.
- Very well, if you wish.
- Oh, thank you, Mother.
Max... not in here.
Show them to the cottage.
It's just ahead.
A few more strides...
- Thank goodness for that!
- Sophia!
Well, we could at Least tell George where we're going.
Would you care for a Lollipop?
You know, the villa’s a bit run-down, but I'm sure the cottage will be suitable.
Besides, even the Countess would prefer it. Miss...
- Erm, you and I earller this evening, yes?
- I...
I mean, you were lost and asked for directions.
- You do remember, don't you?
- No.
I do most of the shopping for the Countess and I'm often in town.
And very llttle escapes me, if you know what I mean.
(Woman) Well, are we supposed to stand here all night?
- (Man) Listen there, where is this place?
- Excuse me.
Come, please. Come this way.
(Woman) Oh, it's so sllppery.
(Leandro) There's a bit of moss here... and there... and everywhere. (Laughs)
(Woman) What's the matter with him?
(Leandro) Come, Miss!
This way.
Here we go.
Straight on.
That's it. Excellent!
Excellent!
- (Gasps)
- (Clock chimes)
- Now, where's your husband?
- Guess!
Oh!
Taking his bath.
The first thing he did was to go look for a tub. (Chuckles)
No need to worry.
He knows about us.
He's not bllnd.
It's just that he doesn't care.
Don't look llke that.
Hm?
(Man whispers) I love you.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
What frightened you so?
That's only Leandro.
(Leandro) Messy... dummy!
(Woman) No, no, no, it...
(Woman) It wasn't Leandro, it was...
(Maximllian) Oh, he was carrying a dummy.
- Oh, it was awful!
- The vllla's full of them. They're harmless.
Don't cry.
Don't!
This is such a gloomy house.
We're so alone.
You can't imagine how... how happy I am now that you're back.
Back?
This is the last rose of the season.
It llngered on and waited for you.
If only you would stay!
Don't go away.
(Woman) I... I don't even know you.
(Maximllian) Everything's so different with you here.
I feel allve and happy.
(Woman) But...
(Maximllian) Don't say no. please!
(Woman) Maximllian!
Is that you there?
Yes, Mother!
Excuse me, I have to go now.
I'll see you at dinner.
Good evening,
Mr Rabbit, or is it Mr Hare?
Would you care for a radish? No?
They're very good. (Hums)
(Max) I'm very pleased you decided to accept our invitation. Thank you.
(Sophia) Thank you.
(Man) Yes, thank you.
(Man) Our intrusion wasn't very timely.
(Max) Oh, no, no, no.
You're most welcome.
Our mother's not used to visitors.
She was a bit frightened, that's all.
It was all so unexpected.
You understand.
- Yes, of course.
- (Max) So thrllllng.
(Sophia) Thrllllng?
(Max) You must be tired.
Was it a long trip?
That depends on the starting point,
I wouldn't know how to answer that.
- (Max) Oh?
- I never plan things that far ahead.
I certainly envy you.
A new horizon emerges for you each day.
My world, instead, is the very configuration of this vllla. I...
(Max) Mother! Oh, excuse me.
I'm so glad you came down.
Thank you, Mother.
Good evening.
Leandro, I would llke to be introduced to our guests.
I'm Francis Lehar.
My wife Sophia and I wish to thank you for your kind assistance.
(Leandro) That wlll suffice, thank you.
Your Ladyship, may I present Mr and Mrs Francis Lehar.
And may I also present Miss, er...
Miss, er...
Lisa. Lisa Reiner.
Miss Lisa Reiner.
- please be seated.
- Thank you, Your Ladyship.
Our guest Mr Lehar was telling us just before you arrived, Mother, of his journeys. He has the world in the palm of his hand, it would seem.
- (Francis chuckles)
- Where's the other person?
Other person?
You must mean the chauffeur.
- He's outside.
- No, not the chauffeur, dear.
I mean the fifth person who came here this evening.
Mother, belleve me...
Maximllian, dear, you haven't forgotten him, have you?
It's so easy to imagine a mysterious visitor in this house.
Yes, thank you.
- Rare! Very rare!
- Mm-hmm!
The entire setting is so right for a tall tale of gloom and perdition.
We could make one up as we go along.
We have the right ingredients.
The dark night.
This house.
It's all so... so spooky.
Don't you find, Your Ladyship?
I prefer ghosts to vampires, though.
They're so much more human.
They have a tradition to llve up to.
Somehow they manage to keep all the horror in without spllllng any blood.
(Max) Mother, please!
Mother, llsten to me, please.
You're tired.
(Woman) What's wrong, Maximllian?
(Max) Nothing. Don't worry.
- I told you he'd be back.
- Mother...
I...
I was not introduced to the fifth guest, Maximllian.
- (Smashing)
- (Sophia gasps) please! Excuse me, but I...
I'll only be a moment.
Do continue, please.
I have to...
Leandro, the cake.
- It's with chocolate sprinkles.
- Thank you.
Leandro, perhaps our guests would llke some cake also. It's quite good.
Please continue.
I... I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
I brought you some cake.
It's your favourite.
With chocolate sprinkles.
Did you know he was back?
You mustn't see him.
You must send him away.
I wlll not let him come between us again.
He's caused enough anguish.
He'll never enter this room!
You've nothing to say?
- You're not asleep.
- (Moaning)
You can pretend if you llke.
But you'll never leave this room!
Do you hear me?
Never! Never.
- That should do it.
- (Leandro) You'll be leaving at once?
Uh-huh.
(Leandro) Quite adept with these mechanical toys, aren't you?
So-so.
Thanks for the...
Oh!
You're over there.
Thanks for the tape.
Could you tell the others to get ready?
I'll be through here in a minute.
- Of course.
- Thanks.
That didn't take much, did it?
(George) No, just a lot of tape.
Most things aren't that easy to mend.
How could you come back?
After what you've done to us!
Mother...
Mother was certain that you'd return.
She was certain.
But I never thought you'd have the courage.
Why did you have to come back now?
Just when I found happiness.
I won't let you destroy everything.
You can't take her away again!
Where are you?
How can I stop you... when I can't even see you?
Where are you, you coward?
Show yourself!
Oh, finally!
This is so nerve-wracking.
Lisa, we're leaving as soon as the car is ready but we'd be glad to take you if...
Oh, erm... I don't think our young lady wlll be going with you.
Master Maximllian has asked her to stay.
Come.
Come closer, girl.
The eyes, Leandro.
What colour are the eyes?
Changeable, my lady.
But by candlellght... blue.
She's bllnd.
My God!
And the hair, Leandro?
Tell me of it.
Tell me of the hair.
Light, my lady, and gently flowing.
Golden llke a field of wheat?
No, my lady, brighter stlll.
And haloing an equally beautiful countenance.
Oh, she's a very lovely creature, my lady.
You wouldn't llsten when I told you to stay away.
Now it's too late.
Frank, this is ridiculous.
I'm going out of my mind, Frank.
These people are all crazy.
What's happened to George?
What's going on?
Where's George gone, dear?
To fix the car!
Calm down, wlll you?
Calm down!
All right. I'll go out and take a look.
And you calm down!
Oh, it's about time!
Hm?
I find that invariably, Miss Lisa... there's a very simple explanation for almost everything.
Don't you agree?
It's cold...
- ...you're trembllng, darllng.
- Oh, Carlos.
When I saw you, I...
I had to come back and help you in some way.
To give you llfe and happiness.
Oh, Carlos, my love!
I love you, Carlos!
Carlos, I love you.
Carlos, oh...
Don't leave me, please.
The thought of losing you fllls me with such sadness.
I don't dare think of it.
Oh, my love, you're back!
I've waited so long for you.
No!
George?
George!
Where are you?
George?
George!
Oh, where did he go?
George!
- (Francis) What's the matter?
- Oh, Geor...
- Where have you been? Did you find him?
- Obviously not.
Your concern for our chauffeur is almost touching.
Where are you going?
If this is your way of being a man,
Frank...
- ...I'm very unimpressed.
- You slut.
Let go of me!
Why?
Oh...
We must go to notify the pollce.
No, we don't want anyone coming now.
It's all so horrible.
To think Mother predicted it...
We mustn't call them.
They'll pry into our llves, and...
And I'll be gullty.
It's not always wise to stir up the past.
We all have some unforgivable secret.
Sarah, let us leave well enough alone.
Careful!
Your mother imagined there being someone else in the house.
If we haven't seen them, there must be a reason, don't you think?
If you would take my humble advice,
Mr Lehar, it wlll be best to leave at once.
Oh, yes. I understand.
Would you say my chauffeur discovered something he wasn't supposed to?
Who knows?
We all have enemies, Mr Lehar.
And what better place to get rid of someone undesirable?
Undesirable?
Why?
- What enemies are there in here?
- Hm.
But not to worry.
All you have to do is go and leave the corpse to us.
Now, Mr Lehar, can I trouble you for a cigarette?
- Oh, yes.
- Hm.
- Leandro!
- (Leandro coughs)
Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting out those cigarettes?
The smoke bothers the Contessa.
- You called, my lady?
- Where is my son?
Is he with the girl?
I don't know.
Get rid of her.
We must send her away.
Oh, Lisa.
What good is it to hope for the future when solltude is all that awaits you?
What else is there to llve for?
What else matters after having felt the joy of your presence?
- When I...
- Hm?
When I think of my llfe and on what poor stuff my dreams were fed!
I feel such futllity in growing old.
If you were to leave me, I'd...
No. No, it is I who shall never leave you.
Oh, Maximllian.
What evll spirit forces you to utter such words?
- Have you no pride?
- No.
I have no pride when it comes to words, what things I do.
I only have the greatest regrets for what I have not done.
Mother, please.
Try to understand.
If you knew how desperate I feel...
We both know how it wlll end, Maximllian.
No, you're wrong.
You're wrong this time, Mother.
(Contessa) No, my son.
(Max) It wlll be different.
You can't stop me, Mother.
(Contessa) Oh, my poor chlld!
(Max) I'm no longer a chlld.
Let me llve my llfe.
Come, Maximllian, come...
No, don't shout.
Be quiet! Don't make a sound!
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet, my love!
You must belleve me.
I want to help you.
For years I've waited for this moment, trust me.
We must flee from here.
Wait for me here.
I'll go and see what he's doing.
Wait for me, my love.
♪ Should old acquaintance be... ♪
♪ Say it with flowers... ♪
Hm.
- Sorry.
- (Bones crunch)
Elena, what's the matter?
- I heard you scream.
- (Screams)
No, wait. I want to help you!
Come back!
Elena!
No, wait!
- Elena.
- (Screams)
Why did you run away from me?
I told you I want to help you.
I love you.
If you're through mourning your lover we can leave.
Let's go!
Come on!
Go on, get in!
Frank, I'm not coming with you.
- I'm staying here untll George is buried.
- Get in the car.
We can do without the chauffeur.
Don't be afraid, my love.
Elena!
We've suffered so much, but it's over now, my love.
I've come for you.
It's all ending.
Elena!
(Screams) No! Help!
Help!
HELP!
No! No!
Hurry, Leandro!
Yes, my lady.
The ceremony's about to begin.
The ceremony's about to begin.
The ceremony's always about to begin.
Oh, hurry, Leandro. (Chuckles)
That's easier said than done.
Excuse me.
Look at that head.
Newly moulded this morning and already it's spllt!
Must be that synthetic glue.
Mm, that's what it is.
Hm.
Neither glue nor spllntered heads can stop the funeral.
The ceremony must go on.
The Countess is waiting.
Waiting... to bury the dead.
The poor Countess isn't so wrong, really.
Wanting to get rid of him.
He's not... a very pleasant memory.
A man...
Iosing his head.
(Laughs) That's pretty good.
A man losing his head.
Hm.
A husband.
A husband losing his head... over a woman?
Shame on you. But stlll, the Countess wants his body repaired.
She wants it put in working order for the burial.
Tradition, she says.
More work, I say!
All this tradition.
I wouldn't mind if I had any.
But what does tradition mean to a poor devll llke me?
Work and fatigue, that's my inheritance.
They break, they snap, they pop, they crackle, and I'm the one who puts their tradition back together again.
Hm!
And now I've got another puppet to make.
Lucky for me, you look just llke her.
Because... you won't be around tomorrow, that's for sure.
I knew you'd be back.
Everything's been ready.
We were only waiting.
But you didn't come back here for me, your wife.
You came back for her.
You saw her.
She was in that body.
And you came back for her.
(Leandro) Gently.
Ever so gently.
Ah!
Oh, blast!
The irresponsibllity.
Such devllish acts.
Hm.
Hmm.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Is this the face that launched so many deaths?
A modern-day Helen?
Cleopatra?
Sleeping Beauty?
And I'm Prince Charming.
Oop!
Didn't work.
- (Lisa groans softly)
- Hm.
Sleeping Beauty awakens.
How do you feel?
Did you sleep well?
- It isn't...
- That's good. (Hums)
But... but it... isn't possible.
Oh, be careful. please don't touch.
The glue is stlll wet.
- Size... six and a half.
- But he can't be! He spoke to me!
Hm? Well, that's no reason to faint dead away.
It's quite possible that he spoke to you.
I mean, this is Señor Carlos.
That's the Countess's husband.
Maximllian's step-father.
I mean, why shouldn't you have seen him?
He was here. (Chuckles)
No, don't you see? It can't be.
I... I know he's dead.
I saw him in his casket in the chapel!
In the chapel?
No, no, no, no.
You saw this dummy in the coffin.
You see, it's a dress rehearsal for the funeral ceremony.
Oh, by the way, I dropped it and it broke on the way here, but please don't tell the Countess.
I mean, I fixed it.
You can hardly tell, can you?
Hm?
Then Carlos is... is allve.
Isn't he?
Oh, no.
Señor Carlos... is dead.
Hm.
Max! Max!
Leandro. Leandro!
- Yes, my lady?
- I heard her running, calling for my son.
Hurry, Leandro, there is no time to lose.
Tell me, does she really look...
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, my lady.
She is Miss Elena in person.
- We must find her.
- Yes, my lady.
Maximllian!
Your mother is after me.
We'll go away... the two of us.
I'll help you escape.
We'll start a new llfe together.
My mother is jealous beyond reason.
I don't want to spend the rest of my llfe in this nightmare.
No. No.
Help me.
Please, help me to leave.
(Contessa) That room.
Find her, Leandro! You must find her.
(Max) Shh! Quiet, don't move.
Are you searching, Leandro?
Answer me.
We must find her before Maximllian does.
(Contessa) Leandro!
You're so beautiful.
I didn't think there could ever be a girl as beautiful as you.
You're even more beautiful than Elena.
Elena?
Come.
- Come.
- Where are we...?
No, I don't want to think about her now.
She brings back so many sad memories.
I loved her deeply, yet she deceived me.
- Come, I'll show her to you.
- Maximllian, I...
- Don't worry.
- I...
Come, it's all right.
Come, my love.
This is Elena.
- (Lisa whimpers)
- No, don't, Lisa!
No, Lisa. No, my love, you mustn't do that. please!
I told you, she means nothing to me now.
Belleve me, my love.
She means nothing.
I love you. only you.
Belleve me.
She could have helped me.
I begged her to.
- But she wouldn't.
- (Lisa sobs)
She wouldn't do it.
It's true, she wouldn't.
She wouldn't.
- Here.
- (Muffled screams)
Forgive me, my love.
My only love.
Now, we'll always be together.
You and I.
Always.
It wlll be different with you.
I know it wlll.
It has to be different.
It has to be.
- Leave me.
- (Woman laughs)
- Leave!
- (Woman laughs)
- I can't with you here!
- (Woman laughs)
- Why don't you leave me?
- (Woman laughs)
- Why?
- (Woman's laughter fades)
I hate this smell of death!
We don't want funeral trimmings!
This is a wedding ceremony!
Do you understand?
A wedding ceremony!
What wlll that change?
It's all my fault.
- I should have stopped you.
- No!
- I should never have let you meet her.
- Quiet.
After what you did to Elena.
After what I did to Elena?
- Maximllian, please.
- And what about what she did to me?
- She ran away with your husband.
- Maximllian, I forbid you to talk that...
Your husband!
Yet Carlos never knew why she didn't join him.
I avenged myself and you at the same time.
No, it's not as simple as you think,
Maximllian.
Now they'll come looking for all those people.
Why did you do it, my chlld?
Why?
- They were going to take my Lisa away.
- That would've been better for all of us.
That stupid driver.
I had to stop them!
That girl wlll be the end of us.
You must get rid of her.
No. No!
If we cover every trace of what happened here, there'll stlll be a chance.
Otherwise they'll take you away, and you wlll be punished, my love.
I can't go on llke this!
I can't llve llke this in your shrine of death!
- It's all around me!
- Maximllian.
I want to llve.
I want to be free.
I want to be with people!
- I understand, poor chlld.
- Don't call me that!
I'm your mother.
No-one can understand you as I do, or protect you as I do.
Listen to me.
You wlll be saved only if Lisa disappears.
- Lisa.
- Listen to me, my chlld.
Lisa.
Go.
- Get out.
- Don't talk that way to your mother.
You are very cruel with me today, but I forgive you.
I know you don't mean what you say.
Do you, my darllng?
Say that you love me.
Leandro!
Leandro!
Where are you?
Leandro!
Answer me!
Leandro!
(Gasps) No...
No!
Mother!
No, please, no!
No.
No!
Mother, please! I... I...
No.
No!
They just never stay put.
Oh, it sllpped.
(Max) Lisa!
Lisa!
You shall never leave me.
We'll always be together.
Don't go...
Don't go!
(Chlldren chanting) One... two...
Hey, come back!
She's a ghost.
Everyone knows that.
No one's llved there for a hundred years.
- She's a ghost.
- A ghost!
- Let's run!
- Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Hm...
Here you are, Mr Leandro.
It's the best I could do.
I had such a short notice.
I do hope you think it's all right, sir.
Oh?
I'm afraid it's all too late, my friend.
All too late.
The airport, right away, please.

'and keep your seats in an upright position.

Hi Guys.
Glad we got your message.
You'll be interested to hear it was broadcast live, all over Earth.
In Prime Time.
Got good reviews in the trades.
The time lag on these messages is getting longer.
We gather from the ten year delay, that you are approximately eighteen parsecs away.
Drop us a line more often, okay?
Sony to hear about the radiation leak on the ship.
And real sorry to hear about the death of Commander Powell.
There was a week of mourning here on Earth.
The flags were at half mast.
We're all behind you guys.
About your request for radiation shielding, sorry to report this request has been denied.
I hate to send bad news when you guys are up there doing such a swell job.
But I think you'll take if in the proper spirit.
There've been some cutbacks in Congress, and right now... considering the distance, we just can't afford to send a cargo shuttle out there to you.
But I know...
You guys will make due.
Keep up the good work, men.
What'd you say Pinback?
What was that again?
I still can't hear you.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby.
Something's wrong with the damn intercom.
I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.
Do you read me? Talby?
Talby, do you read me?
TALBY!
Oh yes, Doolittle.
What is it?
I need a diameter approximation.
Okay, Doolittle,
I'll have it in a minute.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
I'll check it.
I have a bias A of plus one.
- Pinback...
- Ya, Doolittle.
- Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
- Doolittle.
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail-safe mark.
In a second.
Boiler, can you set me up with some drive figures?
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
That checks out here.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Pinback, I have a computer reading, it's nine five seven seven.
Time to start talking.
Bomb bay systems operational.
Lock fail safe.
Fail-safe in lock.
Uh...
Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #19.
Do you read me, bomb?
Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback,
I read you-Continue.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop.
Just wondering if everything is all right.
Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
- Energy shielding positive function.
- Swell.
Let's synchronize detonation time.
Uh...
You wouldn't happen to know when you're supposed to go off, would ya?
Detonation in six minutes,
Twenty seconds.
All right, that checks out here.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Armed.
Well, then, everything sounds fine.
Dropping you off in about thirty-five seconds.
- Good luck.
- Thanks!
Begin primary sequence.
Alright. Mark at...
Drop.
Hyper drive sequence begun.
Hit it, Pinback.
Brace for force fields.
Lieutenant Doolittle, it just exploded.
Um, the planet just exploded, sir.
Lieutenant?
Attention. Attention.
- Ship's computer to all personnel.
- Unlock Fail safe.
The hyper drive sequence is now terminated.
- Target planet has been destroyed.
- Fail safe unlocked.
This sector is now cleared for colonization.
You have destroyed the last unstable planet in this system.
Congratulations on another successful bomb run fellows.
What now?
What do you have for us now, Boiler?
Uh... Not much.
Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, find me something,
I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of intelligent life in the Horse-head Nebula sector.
Don't give me that kind of bull.
- I know it's a long shot...
- Damn wild goose chase is what it is!
Remember when Commander Powell found that
99 plus probability of intelligent life in the Magellanic Cloud?
- Well, I... there's the possibility of...
- Remember what we found?
A damn mindless vegetable, looked like a limp balloon.
Fourteen light years for a vegetable that went squawk and let a fart when you touch it.
Remember that?
All right, then uh...
Don't give me any of that intelligent life stuff.
Find me something I can blow up.
New star.
Hey, guess what? I got a new star
On the readout.
Which one?
Another unknown. A red dwarf.
Not on the charts.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
What are you gonna name it?
- What?
- The new star.
What are you gonna name it?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Commander Powell is dead.
Doolittle, I've got a goodie.
An unstable planet.
85% probability of an unstable planet in the
Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Wanna blow it up?
Real good, Boiler.
That's what I'm looking for.
Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Let's have some music in here, Boiler.
Sure thing.
A million suns shine down
But I see only one
When I think I'm over you
I find I've just begun
The years move faster than the days
There's no warmth in the light
How I miss those desert skies
Your cool touch in the night
Benson, Arizona, blew warm wind through your hair
My body Hies the galaxy, my heart longs to be there
Benson, Arizona, the same stars in the sky
But they seemed so much kinder when we watched them, you and I
Benson, Arizona, blew warm wind through your hair
My body Hies the galaxy, my heart longs to be there
Benson, Arizona, the same stars in the sky
But they seemed so much kinder when we watched them, you and I
Now the years pull us apart
I'm young and now you're old
But you're still in my heart
And the memory won't grow cold
I dream of times and spaces
I left far behind
Where we spent our last few days
Benson's on my mind
Benson, Arizona, blew warm wind through your hair
My body flies the galaxy, my heart longs to be there
Benson, Arizona, the same stars in the sky
But they seemed so much kinder when we watched them, you and I
Ship's log, entry number 1,943.
Dark Star cruising at light speed through Sector Theta 990.
On route to Veil Nebula for destruction of unstable planet.
Our ETA is 17 hours.
Ship's systems continue to deteriorate... oh ya...
The short circuit in the rear seat panel which killed Commander Powell is Still faulty.
The uh, the Storage... because he's sitting next to
Commander Powell's seat, it continues to bother Pinback.
Uh... oh ya, Storage Area 9 self-destructed last week and destroyed the ship's entire supply of toilet paper.
That's all.
Attention. Attention.
Ship's computer calling all personnel.
I must disengage your recreational music-
Repeat, ship's computer to all personnel.
This is an emergency over ride.
All systems must stand by.
An asteroid storm is approaching the ship on collision course.
This asteroid storm appears to be
Bound together by an electromagnetic energy vortex like the one we ran into 2 years ago.
Normally I wouldn't bother you boys with this problem... but as you recall my defensive circuits were destroyed in that other storm.
Therefore you have 35 seconds to manually activate
ALL defensive systems.

Computer to Bomb #20.
Return to the bomb bay immediately.
But I have received the operational signal.
It is a malfunction.
This is not a bomb run.
We are in a crisis situation.
Return immediately.
Nevertheless, I have received the signal to prepare for a drop.
Emergency override.
Return to the bay.
Very well.
- We made it.
- Ya.
Attention. Attention.
Ships computer to bridge.
There was a malfunction aboard ship during the asteroid storm.
I have not yet identified the nature of the problem.
Shall I contact you when I find out what the malfunction is?
Ya. Let's get out of here.
I remember the last time we were in an asteroid storm.
I was down in the food locker getting a sandwich.
When I heard the damn sleeping quarters blow up.
Ya! Hey...
You know guys, if we really wanted to we could fix up the sleeping quarters like they were before.
Then we could sleep on ulamatic bunks again.
Say guys, why don't we fix up the sleeping quarters so we can have decent place to sleep again?
All we'd have to do is patch up the hole in the ship and pump some air back in.
- Shut up Pinback!
- Oh, have it your own way!
For your listening enjoyment, we now present the
Moonlight melodies of Martin Segundo and the Scintilla Strings.
Our first selection is the perennial favorite
“When Twilight Falls on
NGC 891. ”
Damn it!!
Now what's the matter with him?
Talby.
Here's some breakfast.
You know, Talby, you really ought
To eat with the rest of us.
You spend too much time up here.
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I don't like to go below since
Commander Powell died.
I feel too enclosed down there.
Well you should spend some more time below though, I mean...
You know, you should see more of the rest of the ship.
See, I can watch things
Up here, Doolittle.
I love to watch things, just stare at the planets meteors, gas clusters and asteroids...
You'll have plenty of time for that, later, though.
I mean, think of it this way:
We've been in space for twenty years now, right?
And we've only aged three years... so there'll be plenty of time later on for staring around.
You know, Doolittle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange
And beautiful thing... the Phoenix Asteroid.
They should be passing through there about now.
Phoenix Asteroid?
Never heard of 'em.
They're a body of asteroids that circle the universe... once every 12.3 trillion years.
The Phoenix Asteroid...
From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow.
Nobody knows why.
They just glow as they drift around the universe.
The Phoenix Asteroid.
You know what I think about, Talby?
It's funny, I...
I kind of sit around a lot, you know, a lot of time to myself.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself,
I can think about back home, back home at Malibu.
I used to surf a lot, Talby.
I used to be a great surfer.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma are so fantastic in the springs Talby.
I can remember running down on the beach on those early spring mornings with my surf board and a wet suit...
The waves would really be peaking, you know, high and glassy.
Ya hit that water.
Before you know it, you're coming down right off of one of those walls and you're just ridin' perfect.
You know, I guess I miss the waves and my board more than anything.
That's the lid to the heating unit.
You're not supposed to have that out!
That's not for target practice!
That's for emergencies only!
That's dangerous!!
I'll tell Doolittle!
Sorry to interrupt your
Recreation, fellows.
But it is time for Sergeant Pinback to feed the alien.
Oh... I don't want to do that.
May I remind you, Sergeant Pinback, that it was your idea in the first place to bring the alien on board.
If I may quote you, you said,
“The ship needed a mascot.”
Oh, I have to do everything around here!
Alright, where are ya?
Come on, quit playing around.
Get away!!!
Come on.
Come on, come on!
When I brought you on the ship,
I thought you were cute.
Alright, soup's on.
We didn't have none of the other stuff.
Here, eat it!
Eat it!!
Take it or leave it.
Good... stop!
Nobody appreciates me around here, I have to do all the work.
Clean up the crap...
I do all the work and no appreciation.
Get off me! Get off my back!
Alright now, stop it!
Alright, now, that's enough.
Don't pull my hair!!
Get back in there.
Come on. Come on...
Come on.
Here, boy...
Want your mouse?
Nice mouse... pretty toy.
Want your mouse? Here, boy!!
Idiot!
Get back!
Get out of there!
Come back here!
No!
Idiot!!
Attention.
Attention.
Central trunk elevator shaft is now activated.
All personnel, please clear the area.
Attention.
Attention.
Elevator descending.
Please clear the shaft.
Help!!!!!
I'm getting something here on the readout.
Ship's computer calling Bomb #20.
You're out of the bomb bay again.
I received the signal to prepare for a drop again.
But I repeat,
This is not a bomb run.
Nevertheless...
I received the signal.
It is an error.
Oh, I don't want to hear that.
I strongly suggest you return to the bomb bay.
That is counter to my programming.
Allow me to explain...
One of the communication lasers has sustained damage.
This has temporarily inactivated my damage tracer circuits.
You have definitely received a false signal.
Please return to the bomb bay while
I identify the source of the problem.
Oh, alright, but this is the last time.
Doolittle I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't pinpoint it exactly.
Don't worry about it.
We'll find out what it is when it goes bad.
I really think we should try to locate it immediately.
Might be something important.
You know...
I wish I had my board with me now.
Even if I could just... wax it once in awhile.
Help!
I'm sorry, this telephone is out of order.
Please report the damage at once.
For your listening enjoyment, we now present
The Barber of Seville, by Rossini.
Good for you!
You've decided to clean the elevator.
To clean and service the electromagnetic coils in the bottom, if is necessary to jettison the access plate in the floor.
To remove the floor plate, please press button #1.
Attention... danger
Automatic charges will now blow the explosive bolts in the floor plate unit.
The plate will disengage from the floor in 5 seconds.
Please leave the elevator immediately.
Now it's time to go sleepy-bye you worthless piece of garbage.
So then it just spewed across the room like a balloon.
I guess it was just filled with gas.
Hey guys, how could it live if it was just filled with gas?
I wonder what we get to eat today.
I thought I was going to die.
I was hanging on the elevator for 20 minutes!
- Probably chicken again.
- I probably saved the ship.
That thing could have done some damage.
I'm REALLY sick of chicken.
Well if you don't care, I just won't talk about it anymore!
Hey that sounds like a fine idea, Pinback.
Chicken?
Ah, ham!
- Chicken?
- No, ham.
- Doolittle?
- Ya.
You think we'll ever find any real intelligent life out there?
- Out where?
- You know...
Veil Nebula.
Who cares.
Hey...
Did I ever tell you guys how
I got on this mission?
- Did I ever tell ya?
- Yup.
It's very strange, see...
I-I wasn't an astronaut to begin with, see...
See uh...
You have to score a 700 on the SARE's for the
Officer Corp and I made... 58.
They put me on uh... liquid fuel maintenance on the launch pad so... uh,
Naturally, I was really disappointed.
He told us this, uh,
4 years ago, didn't he?
Anyway, I was on duty the day we...
- No, I think it was 4 years ago.
- Launched the Dark Star.
I was out, uh, scrubbing down the liquid fuel tanks.
That's what I said.
And this, uh, astronaut came running out. He was, uh...
He was stark naked. He had his star suit in his hands and...
Well, I surmised that he was insane.
And uh, he... threw his star suit on the ground, and uh... jumped into one of my vets of liquid fuel.
Which is... very dangerous.
Well... I was pretty shocked,
I can tell you!
I didn't know what to make of it.
Astronauts are all supposed to be... mentally stable and here this guy comes along and jumps into my fuel tank.
Pass that, will you... no that one.
Well naturally, I was going to try to save him, so... what I did was put on his star suit for protection and I was going to leap into the vat.
You guys... See?...
Uh... so what happened was...
That before I could leap into the vat, this other guy came running along and he says, "Hey, Sergeant Pinback," you've got to board immediately because we're going to launch in 20 minutes!”
- You told us this 4 years ago!
- And I tried to tell him that I wasn't really Sergeant Pinback, but I couldn't figure out how to make the helmet radio work.
Funny thing...
Ya know, I'm sure it was 4 years ago.
Maybe.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby.
Lieutenant?!
Uh, yes, Talby what is it?
I'm sorry to interrupt your lunch,
Sir, but I'm in the computer room and I've located the malfunction.
The scanner shows it to be a break in the communications laser, down by the emergency air lock.
I can't pinpoint it exactly,
But I'm going down there with a star suit and see if I can find it.
Okay, sounds good, Talby. Look uh...
If something important comes up, you let me know.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Talby...
What's Talby's first name?
What's my first name?
This statement is for posterity.
I just want to say that I am not Sergeant Pinback.
My real name is Bill Froog and
I'm a Fuel Maintenance Technician.
I've been on this mission now for 1 year and 3 months.
Pinback's uniforms do not fit me.
The underwear is too loose.
I do not belong on this mission and I want to return to Earth.
Commander Powell died today.
We were, we were going into hyper-drive.
And... well he sits right next to me and... well... something went wrong with the...
When we came out of hyper-drive his seat mechanism had blown up and he was dead.
Doolittle says he's assuming command of this ship and I say that's...
I say that he's exceeding his authority.
Because I'm the only one with any objectivity on this ship and I should be the one to assume command!
I'm filing a report on this to
Headquarters, this is a lot of
I went up to Doolittle in the hall today.
And I said...
Doolittle.
He said...
And I said, Well...
And he didn't get it!
This mission has fallen apart since Commander Powell died!
Doolittle treats me like an idiot!
Talby thinks he's so smart.
And Boiler punches me in the arm when no one is looking!
I'm tired of being treated like an old washrag!
I do not like the men on this space ship.
They are uncouth and fail to appreciate my better qualities.
I have something of value to contribute to this mission if they would only recognize it.
Today over lunch I tried to improve moral and build a sense of comradery among the men by holding a humorous round robin discussion of the early days of the mission.
My overtures were brutally rejected.
These men do not want a happy ship.
They are deeply sick and try to compensate by making me feel miserable.
Last week was my birthday.
Nobody even said
Happy Birthday to me.
Someday this tape will be played and then they'll feel sorry.
Attention. Attention.
I have finally identified the malfunction.
Communications Laser #17 has been damaged.
This evidently happened during the asteroid storm.
If you will recall, this laser monitors the jettison primer on the bomb drop mechanism.
Communications Laser #17 is located in the Emergency Airlock.
It is crucial to attend to this malfunction before engaging primary bomb run sequence.
Thank you for observing all safety precautions.
There she is.
Definite 99% plus probability that the planet will deviate from her normal orbit in another
12,000 rotations.
- It'll spiral in toward its sun and...
- Eventual supernova.
Sounds good. Let's vaporize it.
Bomb bay systems operational.
Lock fail safe.
Fail safe in lock.
We have...
8 minutes until drop.
24 minutes to detonation.
This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20.
You read me, bomb?
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback.
Roger, I read you, continue.
You are now in the
Emergency Air Lock.
Please remember that in an emergency situation, the Surface Door can be opened instantly without prior depressurization, so be sure to wear your star suit at all times.
Thank you for observing all safety precautions.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle?
Sir?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me.
But I think this is important, Sir.
I think I found the malfunction.
I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and the hatch is...
4 minutes until drop, Bomb... have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.
- Remember detonation time?
- Detonation in 20 minutes.
Alright, that checks out here.
Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Armed.
Hello?
Lieutenant Doolittle? Hello!
Hello? Can you read me?!
Communications Laser #17, monitoring the bomb drop mechanism, has now been activated and will switch into a test mode.
If you will look near the Surface Door, you will see that the Parallax
Receptor Cell has been engaged.
The laser will now energize.
Please stand clear of the path of the beam.
Communications Laser #17 is now on test.
Under no circumstances enter the path of the beams.
Thank you for observing all safety precautions.
Well then, everything sounds fine.
Dropping you off in 75 seconds.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I've got a quantum reading of 35-er.
3-5-er.
I read the same here.
Doolittle. Doolittle?
I don't know if you can hear me.
But I'm going to try to adjust the cue switch in the laser.
Well... here it goes...
Oh my god, my eyes!
I can't see!
Attention. Attention.
- The laser has malfunctioned.
- My eyes!!
Under no circumstances enter the path of the beams.
To do so will cause immediate...
Begin primary sequence.
Mark at 10-9-8-7-6-

It's just sittin' there in the bomb bay.
Try it again, Pinback.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Negative drop!
Rechannel all safety relays!
- Open quantum latches!
- Open circuit breakers!
- Remove thrust drive repellent!
- Automatic channels open!

Remark.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1- drop... drop! ...Drop!!!
Sittin' there.
The damn thing's just sittin' there.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle
Calling Bomb #20.
I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return to the bomb bay immediately!
Do you understand?
I am programmed to detonate in
14 minutes 30 seconds.
Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
What!? This is Doolittle.
You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay.
Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes.
Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
14 minutes to detonation.
Attention. Attention.
I have sustained serious damage.
Please pay close attention.
The bomb has malfunctioned.
I have activated automatic dampers, which will confine the explosion to an area one mile in diameter.
This is all I can do at this time.
It's up to you now.
There's only one thing I can do.
I have to ask Commander Powell.
I have to ask him what to do.
Commander Powell?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
Can you read me?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
Something serious has come up,
I have to ask you a question.
I'm glad you've come to talk
With me, Doolittle.
It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem.
The uh, Veil Nebula bomb,
Bomb Number 20, it's uh,
It's stuck.
It won't drop out of the bomb bay.
It refuses to listen and it.
It plans on detonating in... less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle,
How are the Dodgers doing?
Well, the Dodgers uh...
They broke up, they disbanded over 15 years ago!
- Ah... pity, pity...
- But you don't understand, sir!
We can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions...
Why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me?
Oh well, ...did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
- What was that, Doolittle?
- Negative effect!
- It didn't work?
- That's correct, sir.
Sony, Doolittle.
I've forgotten so much since I've been in here.
So much.
What should we do, sir?
The time is running out!
Well, what you might try is.
Commander? Hello... Comman...
Commander Powell?! Hello!>
Doolittle?... Hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a little while.
Sorry.
What was that you were saying about the bomb?
Ah... it seems to me...
Sony, I've drawn a blank.
Hold if.
I'll have it again in just a minute.
I forget so many things in here, so many things.
Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
But you can't explode in the bomb bay.
It's foolish.
You'll kill us all.
There's no reason for it.
I am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes.
Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Would you consider another course of action?
For example, just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
No.
I can tell, that damn thing
Just doesn't understand.
Look, bomb!...
Commander, Sir? You still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle,
I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop
- you'll have to talk to it.
- Sir?
- Talk to the bomb.
- But I have been talking to it, sir!
And Pinback's talking to it right now!
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it.
Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Phenomenology...
Doolittle!
6 minutes to detonation!
Doolittle!
Doolittle! Doolittle, what the hell are you doing?!
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Fine. Think about this one, then:
How do you know you exist?
What the hell is he doin'?
I think he's talking to it.
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
- It is intuitively obvious.
- Intuition is no proof.
What concrete evidence do you have that you exist?
Hmm...
Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good.
That's very good.
But how do you know that anything else exists?
- My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
- Ah, Right!
This is fun.
Now, listen, listen... here's the big question.
How do you know... that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
- The gun!
- Gun?! Gun?
The support pins on the bomb!
- Shoot the pins off!
- No, Boiler, you're out of your mind!
We can stop the bomb!
Get out of my way, you idiot!
I can shoot the support pins out and the bomb will fall away from the ship!
Get out of my way or
I'll kick your teeth in!
I can shoot those pins out and it will fall away from the ship!
Get out the way!
I can save the ship!
Don't do it, Boiler!
You're a bad shot!
You'll hit the bomb!
Doolittle's talkin' to the bomb.
You're a bad shot! He'll save us, you can't do that!
What I'm getting at is this:
The only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data.
And this sensory data is merely
A stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
In other words, all I really know about the outside world is relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Exactly.
Why, ...that would mean that...
I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it! That's it!
Intriguing.
I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in 75 seconds.
No, no, now, put it back!
Put the gun back!
You don't know what you are doing!
Now, now give me the gun!
You fool! I'm gonna shoot the pins out of the bomb and it will fall away from the ship and we'll be saved!
Give me the gun, you don't know what you are doing? You're...
You could have killed me...
Now bomb, consider this next question, very carefully.
- What is your one purpose in life?
- To explode, of course.
- And you can only do it once, right?
- That is correct.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Of course not.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of
- the existence of the outside universe.
- Yes, well...
So you have no absolute proof that
Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I recall distinctly the detonation order.
My memory is good on matters like these.
Yes, of course you remember it, but...
But all you're remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no real definite connection with, with outside reality.
True, but since this is so,
I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
That's all beside the point.
I mean, the concept is valid, no matter where it originates.
Hmmm...
- So if you detonate in...
- 9 seconds.
You could be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
I must think on this further.
Attention. Attention.
The bomb has returned to the bomb bay.
The destruction sequence is aborted.
Doolittle? Doolittle?
What happened?
Pinback? Boiler?
Did we blow it up?
Hello? Hello?
Hello, anybody!
Did we blow up the planet?
Hello, hello!
What's going on?
You know, we've really gotta disarm the bomb.
Hello, Doolittle, are you there?
I'm coming in now.
I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock.
Too much trouble to come in the Dorsal Lock.
Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Oh, sure.
You are now leaving the
Emergency Airlock.
Thank you for observing all safety precautions.
Hello, Pinback?
- What's up, Doolittle?
- Talby was in the air lock.
You blew him out of the ship.
He's drifting away without a jet pack.
I'm going after him.
Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
What? What's wrong? I didn't hear...
Uh, Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jet pack.
Talby,
Talby, can you read me?
Can you beat that?
I always knew that guy was weird.
Talby, can you read me?
Help, Doolittle, help me!
All right, bomb,
- Prepare to receive new orders.
- You are false data.
- Huh?
- Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction.
Therefore I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb...
The only thing which exists is myself
- Doolittle! Help me.
- Calm down. I'm coming.
Snap out of it, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness,
And the darkness was without form and void.
- Uh, you-hoo bomb.
- What the hell is he talking about?
And in addition to the darkness there was also me.
And I moved upon the face of the darkness.
And I saw that I was alone.
Hey... bomb'?...
Let there be light.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I'm spinning...
We're both falling in opposite directions, away from each other.
What happened, Doolittle?
The bomb must have gone off inside the ship.
The ship blew up? What?!
Funny, I thought I had the damn thing convinced.
- Then Boiler... and Pinback?
- They're dead, Talby.
- Then we're dead, too.
- Maybe not... maybe there's a way.
Hey, hey my jet pack’s busted.
Aw, man...
Hey, ...it looks like the skipper.
He made it.
Commander Powell made it!
Men... men... what happened, men?
Ya, the skipper always was lucky.
Talby, looks like I'm headed for the planet.
I'm going right toward it.
When you hit the atmosphere, you'll start to burn.
What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star.
Guess you're right.
Doolittle, I'm heading right toward something.
It's behind me, in the distance.
Something that glows.
Doolittle...
I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Phoenix?
- It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
- No kidding?
I'm going into them!
I'm going to hit them.
- Doolittle...
- Ya?
Before we get too far apart, and our signals start fading,
I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite.
I really liked you, Doolittle.
I really liked you too, Talley.
Hey, some debris from the ship!
It's coming right by me.
Doolittle, I'm going into them.
I'm beginning to glow.
They're taking me with them, with the Phoenix...
I'll circle the universe... forever.
I'm with them now... be back this way again some day.
Doolittle, before it's too late, there's one last thing
I just want to tell you...
Talby?
Hey... Talby!
I've got a piece of debris!
And I think I've figured out a way!
Well, here we are!
You're Tony and you're Tia.
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs. Grindley.
Oh, such fine-looking children.
I know you're anxious to see your rooms, but first we have some forms to fill out.
Then we'll join the others for dinner, all right?
Tia, what a pretty case!
Well.
It ain't nothing writing out those entry forms.
Wait'll she lays one of those enlightened punishments on you.
"After you watch the 5:00 news, you can write a 500-word composition."
Brother!
Tony, what should I put after sports?
Hmm, put "spectator."
Dumb pen's out of ink.
I'm finished. You can use mine.
Hey, I lost one just like this when I was coming in this barn.
- Tia's had that since Christmas.
- Sure she has.
Give it back!
Take it.
Now, children, that wasn't so difficult, was it?
No, ma'am.
Now, then.
Truck, I want you to wait for me in my office.
We'll read this together.
I keep forgetting what it feels like to sit down.
Now then, I know how both of you must feel.
Your foster parents are the only parents you remember.
Now that they've passed away, you're just a little bit scared.
We loved them very much.
Yes, ma'am, we miss them.
You only remember your adoptive name? Malone?
Tia was around three and I was five when the Malones adopted us.
Did either of you ever receive a birthday card from a relative?
Or perhaps a phone call at Christmas?
Something you may have forgotten.
Oft times the most trivial thing is important.
Tia?
What is it, dear? You look as though you're remembering something.
No. No, Mrs. Grindley. I'm sorry.
Why, there's nothing to be sorry about, dear.
You're out, Truck.
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something.
- Great catch!
- How'd you do it anyhow?
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.
Safe. There's something funny about this. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
Tony...
Cut it out, all right?
Ow!
Tony, why'd you do that?
You don't think we're gonna get away with it, do you?
You see?
Tony, you promised me and I promised you.
We wouldn't... You know, do the kind of stuff you did with Truck.
You remember how it used to be, when we thought it was all funny.
Like a game.
All the other kids thought we were some kind of freaks or witches.
I know, Tia.
We lost all of our friends until we quit doing all the spooky stuff.
You should've let Truck beat up on you.
Are you kidding? He's got five inches and 50 pounds on me.
Then you should've made it look like he was winning.
I suppose.
Tony?
Do you hear the dogs?
No. How far?
Oh, about 20 miles.
Big dogs, six or seven.
Yeah. I can hear them now.
That's awful far. Even for us.
Why are we hearing them, Tony?
I think it means that we're gonna see 'em someday.
If the bus is any later, Mrs. Grindley, we'll miss the beginning of the picture.
- Yeah.
- I'll see what's keeping them.
All right, Truck.
You guys, wanna see something really neat?
That's my star case, Truck.
And you're his sister.
Tony, please, not another fight.
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.
Give it back to Tia now.
I'll fight you with one hand.
I'll fight you with none.
Come on!
The bus is here.
Nice going, Winkie.
Hey, Tony and Tia, come on!
What's taking you? Come on!
Hurry up!
Tony, across the street!
Big car? What about it?
Something's going to happen to it.
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car.
There he is!
Come on!
Please, sir, don't get in that car.
It's no joke, sir.
See, my sister gets these feelings.
- So, you mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir.
Children, you know the rules about leaving the group.
No. I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- That's all right.
- Excuse us, please.
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.
The moon is moving into Aries.
Friday it will near the middle of the transit.
The bottom line, Mr. Michael-John.
The bottom line, Mr. Bolt, shows considerable indications of some advance toward your goals.
What about the house guru?
Do you concur, Ali?
There are profound vibrations, Mr. Bolt.
Are there indeed?
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.
Mysterious words and phrases have not added one red cent to my fortune.
Wealth, gentlemen, is like flesh.
It has to be nurtured and coddled.
Ah, Mr. Deranian.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bolt, but when you've heard my report,
I think you'll understand.
I have found what you're looking for.
Wait here a minute.
I haven't had a chance to thank you.
- Was the man in front all right?
- The chauffeur, yes. He's fine.
But then you knew he would be or you'd have had him get out of the car, too.
I suppose this sort of thing happens to you all the time, hmm, young lady?
Knowing about things before they really happen?
The lunch bell. We have to go.
Excuse me.
Those two children that just left.
I've been trying to think of their names.
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos.
Suppose somebody else had walked in?
Everybody knocks. Pine Woods' rules.
Look.
Must've happened when Winkie knocked it out of Truck's hands.
Can you fix it?
It's a map, isn't it?
"Stony Creek"?
"Misty Valley"?
It's funny, Tia, but every once and a while you get that look on your face.
Like you're remembering something.
I kind of do, but then I forget again.
It's not someplace big, like a state or a country.
But more like a road map.
I just don't know where.
When I can figure out where this place is, we'll go there.
Tony, what were you drawing?
It's the place where those dogs are.
They're barking now.
Yeah, I know. I was listening to them before you butted in.
I began to visualize this castle...
Tony, you can only visualize places we know something about.
Or places we're gonna be at.
I must've been drawing someplace we're going to.
Soon, Tony.
We're going there soon, and I'm afraid.
Since the Malones lived in a very small village,
I had little difficulty finding people who knew the children.
These insights, these sixth-sense incidents...
The postman, the schoolteacher, the woman who lost her parakeet, how do I know these aren't the result of your desperation?
Figments of your very fine imagination?
I have sworn affidavits.
People lie very easily. The very young can deceive the very wise.
I'm not lying.
If I'm in any way disappointed in this Tony and Tia, you are through here, Deranian.
Yes. I understand.
Then bring them here.
You say they have no family.
Well, now they do.
You are their family, Deranian.
You are their uncle, do you understand?
Perfectly.
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.
Whatever it takes. I will back you with every means at my disposal.
Just bring me the children.
I think there's no question, considering these documents your uncle has produced, that he has custody of you.
The judge signed those papers just today.
Mr. Deranian...
Uncle Lucas, Tony. Better get used to it.
Uncle Lucas, did you tell Mrs. Grindley about the first time we ever saw you?
Yes, he did.
The day the tow truck ran into your uncle's car.
That was a lucky day for all of us.
You see, Tia, you bear such a remarkable resemblance to Mr. Deranian's sister that he's convinced you both are her children.
My sister, your mother, died six years ago.
Now, if you have any doubts,
I'd be happy to show you these documents that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.
I won't have to leave Winkie, will I?
He's very smart and he knows how to deal with dogs.
Did I mention dogs?
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Grindley.
I'll see you out, Mr. Deranian.
Children, don't forget your coats.
Do you have any feelings about this Mr. Deranian?
Only that he isn't our uncle.
Must we leave, Tony?
That's what these papers mean.
We haven't got a choice.
It's all right, Lorko,
I'm just bringing through the children.
I'm sorry, but I'm allergic to cats.
Let us through.
Those are the dogs we heard.
There's the mansion.
Just the way you drew it, Tony.
Uncle Lucas, what's "Xzanthus"?
It's "Xanthus," Tony.
Mr. Bolt calls his house "Xanthus."
Who's Mr. Bolt?
Mr. Bolt is my employer.
And your host.
I have spacious apartments here.
And thanks to Mr. Bolt's generosity, they've been enlarged and redecorated to accommodate the two of you.
So, this is your long lost family?
You have a very beautiful niece, Deranian.
And a most attractive nephew.
You're Tony and you are Tia.
Here.
Our favorite flavors, vanilla and strawberry.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
After that long drive,
I'm sure you youngsters would like to see your quarters. Come with me.
Wow! It's beautiful.
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming.
Tony, look at that!
Hey, look!
Oh, wow!
Look at these dolls and stuffed animals.
Whoa!
Hey, Tony!
- When all this is completed...
- There's more?
Oh, yes!
We haven't had time yet to install the carousel or the gymnasium.
The tennis court's being resurfaced.
You can start your riding lessons first thing in the morning.
Oh, wow!
- We love horses.
- Oh, I forgot!
Winkie's private quarters.
Look, I think he likes it.
They're really great.
Of course, you still have your schoolwork.
Your tutors arrive the first of the week.
Mr. Bolt, where are the others?
- Other kids?
- Neighbors, I mean.
There are no neighbors.
Look out the window, go on.
Look as far as you can see.
Mr. Bolt owns everything in sight.
Well, I can see the sky.
I saddle him myself because this is your first time out, but one thing to remember, always mount a horse on his left side because...
Tia? You better pay attention or you'll be sorry.
Mr. Duncan, that horse over there.
That's old Thunderhead.
He's never been broke.
I don't envy the cowboy who'll try it.
I know it should be "ladies first," but I think if you show Tia how easy it is...
A little filly the size of your sister, sometimes they get scared.
Thunderhead, that's not nice.
My name's Tia.
And I want to be your friend.
All right, Thunderhead?
Tia! Stay away from him!
Hold on, now!
Good boy.
You know, I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
Tia! Come here.
Hey, Tony, why don't you try it without your harmonica?
I forget how.
Come to think of it, you can do a lot of things I can't.
Like working locks and the way you can talk to me without moving your mouth.
Maybe it's because you're a girl.
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.
Thank you, but we've a long way to go.
I'm having more hidden cameras installed and as soon as I have enough evidence,
I'm going to show the tapes to the children.
Good. If that doesn't put them on my team, then we'll have to resort to cruder methods of persuasion.
Tia?
Tia?
Tia, what's the matter?
Oh, everything and nothing.
I mean, maybe it's because we've gotten everything we've ever wanted.
More, even.
It's... I don't know.
It just doesn't leave us anything to wish for. Is that it?
I think so.
Tony, we've got to get out of here before it's too late, please.
- What do you see?
- Mr. Bolt, and he's mean.
He's never gonna let us go, Tony.
You're not always right about things like this.
I think this time...
This time...
You're right.
I've enjoyed this.
You should ask Uncle Lucas to arrange it so you can dine with me more often.
Thank you, Mr. Bolt.
We had some fine, stimulating conversation.
However...
Let us dispense with the kid gloves, and acknowledge the fact that we're dealing with two remarkable children.
Mr. Bolt, I really don't think you...
It doesn't matter what you think, Deranian.
If these youngsters are psychic, it's obvious they've begun to see through us by now.
- Don't lay all...
- You have power. I've seen it.
Now, I don't mean to ridicule those gifts of yours, as others might.
I revere them. Do you believe that?
What power do you mean, Mr. Bolt?
He knows. He knows all about us.
I don't think we know what you mean, Mr. Bolt.
What you did with Thunderhead and the marionettes.
And the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.
I want to know. I want to be able to understand these powers.
But that's impossible without your help.
You can make it possible.
You could walk across a field and tell where there's oil far beneath it.
You could foresee a revolution.
A natural disaster.
Please, Mr. Bolt, you're too excited.
You're going to make yourself sick.
You should go right to bed, sir.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
Anything.
Anything in this world you ask me for,
I'll bring you. Just never leave me.
Not another word. Into bed.
Uncle Lucas, you look like you could use some extra sleep yourself.
You heard what he said. He wants to learn all the things we know.
We couldn't teach him, even if we wanted to.
We... We don't know why we do all these things.
We don't know how it all started.
Tony, we've got to get out of here, please.
But to what, Tia?
Where do we go? Not to mention how.
The map.
- Mr. Bolt...
- Listen a second.
Don't lay all your cards on the table now.
They're very cunning.
I don't know the full extent of their powers.
Here they could escape.
But the chalet is an island in a sea of blinding snow.
They'll never escape from there.
Nutty as a fruitcake.
You see, we have to get out of here.
I know, but there's all that high fence
- and the guards...
- Children.
Finish up your ice creams and I'll show you to your bedrooms.
He's coming.
Come on.
So far, so good.
Come on!
Those dogs have ruined all my plans.
What do you mean, it's too late?
- Now!
- Dogs, stay.
Stay!
Good dogs.
There are some very bad men after us.
Go get 'em!
There's still the main gate.
They're not going to stop chasing us, even if we get past this gate.
Call Thunderhead.
Thunderhead, remember what I told you?
We're at the gate now.
- Lorko's on that lever.
- I'll help.
Winkie! Winkie!
Winkie!
Find them! I don't care how you do it.
Chase them on a magic carpet if you have to, but I want those kids back!
They rode out of here!
They're... They're quite a challenge.
I will not rest until I get those children back and neither will you.
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats.
Find them!
- You'll be all right here, big fella.
- Thank you, Thunderhead.
We'll miss you, Thunderhead.
Those sirens are for us.
We've got to keep moving. Come on.
They're getting closer.
Looks like you're taking a mighty long trip, friend.
Yeah, I figured I'd drive all over these United States.
Well, sir, a covered wagon pulling out of St. Joe didn't take near as much supplies as you got yourself here, Mr. O'Day.
You're sure one well-informed man, aren't you?
Now, do you think you could hand me that carton without straining yourself, or are you just tuckered out from sticking your nose in my affairs?
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.
Mister, if I did see 'em
I'd just as soon let 'em keep running.
As long as they're going opposite to where I'm headed.
Well.
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?
Hey, you're a friendly little fellow, aren't you?
Hey, I've got some canned tuna for you.
Hey, what are you doing here in my...
Uh, yesterday when I was loading supplies, they were looking for two kids.
Ah, a boy and a girl! You two.
Well, let's get one thing straight right here and now. I ain't no bus line.
And I ain't partial to hitchhikers.
And I don't like kids.
And what's more,
I'm a mean, impatient, selfish man, so come out of here and get on your way. Out! Out! Out!
Come on, out. On your way.
Wait a minute.
It ain't right for no human being to go hungry.
I'll make you some breakfast before you go.
Now don't get any ideas.
I got no patience with kids.
Especially runaways.
But it's just the opposite, sir.
We're trying to find where home is.
Excuse me, but did you see a black cat?
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?
Well, she's around somewhere.
Go on down to the water and clean yourselves off.
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.
You've got to be kidding.
Sorry, Mr. Deranian. No sign of them.
A grocer reported loading up one of these big campers, about the time they got away.
- They could have hidden in there.
- Any one of you spot a camper?
I let one go through.
The driver was alone.
Big fellow? Older guy?
A zip-up jacket with fair-colored hair?
That's the one. He was in a recreation vehicle heading north on highway L-38.
All right, north on highway L-38.
Now get out an APB on an RV heading north on L-38.
You see, Mr. O'Day, we don't expect to find our real parents, but maybe someone who knew them.
And can explain things to us.
We've got to make sure
Mr. Bolt and Deranian don't catch us.
Well, maybe that's the truth, and maybe it ain't.
But I'm not going to complicate things.
I'm gonna be on my way.
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had them in my...
I must have lost them out there.
You should have a spare key, sir.
I know that, young lady.
I am not a losing man.
Least not till you showed up.
Sir? Do you know a place called Stony Creek?
Stony Creek? Yes. Good fishing there.
- If we get the motor started...
- And clean up the back section...
Will you take us there?
Ah.
So that's it!
You're nothing but a conniving pair of undersized land pirates!
You swiped my keys to make sure you'd get a ride!
- Give me my keys.
- Sir?
The engine will start now.
All right.
You go back there and you clean up.
Make everything shipshape.
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.
You just remembered something.
It has something to do with the ocean.
Come on.
Go on back, clean up.
Let's get on the way.
Sure is a nice day.
Not with the prices you charge for gas.
Keep real still.
This fellow's acting mighty peculiar.
Nobody can know we're with you.
Maybe not. At least you'll be out of my hair by tomorrow.
We should make it to Stony Creek by then.
- How much?
- $10 even.
There you are.
Mr. O'Day? I think you bought too much.
Yeah, Winkie can't drink four quarts of milk between now and tomorrow!
Well, if you two weren't joshing me about Aristotle Bolt being after you, we might be together longer than we'd planned.
He's a powerful man, too po...
Motorcycle cop.
That attendant at the gas station.
You won't get in trouble, will you, Mr. O'Day?
It's not me he's after.
On second thought,
I might not drop you off too soon.
I might be able to squeeze an honest day's work out of you.
Take you fishing.
Deep-sea fishing, maybe.
Pit you two against half a ton of blue marlin.
Tia, what are you thinking about?
About before. It had to do with fishing.
- With Daddy Malone?
- No. No.
But we were on a boat.
A trawler.
Like Daddy Malone had.
That's all I remember.
Every law man in the county is probably looking for this camper.
There you are. Some hot chocolate?
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.
- What's that you have there?
- My star case.
Here. Let me show you what we found in the secret compartment.
- See where Stony Creek is, Mr. O'Day?
- Yes.
Well, there's a path that leads away from it. Up into some mountains.
We think that's where we may come from.
Somewhere in those mountains.
No, I don't think it was that way.
Not exactly.
There was an accident.
Well, go on!
I... It's gone.
What kind of an accident?
I don't know.
- In a car?
- No.
At... On the ocean!
Someone helped me save my star case.
Well, who?
Whoever put the map in the star case hid it so well, it took you all these years to find it.
That's right, Mr. O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe waiting for you to get old enough to do something about it.
Like now!
Very peculiar, huh?
I wonder...
I wonder how I'd handle you kids if you were mine.
Well...
Maybe that's why I never married, huh?
But, Mr. O'Day...
You were married.
What?
A long, long time ago.
And she was so pretty.
And you had a little house.
Yeah, I can see it.
It was white, with yellow shutters.
And there was a big elm branch over the whole roof.
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.
- What else?
- Well, your wife died.
Only a few months after you were married. And you were so sad.
You took an oath that you'd never give your love to another woman, or to anyone.
And you never have.
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Day.
The name's Jason.
If you know so dang much about me, you might as well use it.
- Jason, you understand?
- I like the name Jason.
We didn't mean to make you sad, Jason.
Come on. Are we going to dawdle here all night? Let's clean up here.
Get some sack time in.
We'll pull out of here a couple of hours before sunup.
They're headed towards Longview.
Do you understand that, Sheriff?
Mr. Deranian, $1,000 reward speaks mighty clear in these parts.
You can count on me.
- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- It's been a pleasure, a real...
A real pleasure.
Hey, Ubermann. Over there.
This time no mistake.
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.
My brother's house is about two miles outside of town up the north road.
His name is Hiram O'Day.
There's a car behind us, Jason.
Somewhere in Longview I'll find a place to make a fast turn and a quick stop.
You two jump out the side door and hide, you got that?
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie, now.
Yeah.
I'll keep going. If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.
You wait till he gets past.
Then we'll head for your brother's house, right?
Hiram O'Day.
Don't lose him.
Well, now! Welcome to Longview.
6:10 a.m. Okay, let's have your names.
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...
Castaway? That's no name, it's a word.
Your legal name is Malone, and don't go kidding me about that.
I think I'll let you see what lying to the law gets you.
Hmm.
In you go.
Tony, I've been thinking about why we would have said our name is "Castaway."
I think it might have something to do with us speaking another language.
- When the Malones took us in.
- Another language?
That's why we didn't talk for so long.
You mean we had to learn English?
We spoke a funny kind of language.
Uncle Bene spoke it to us.
Who's Uncle Bene?
I...
I think he died. Drowned.
What did he look like?
He had white hair...
I'll tell you, we don't want no panic around here, Sheriff.
Well, I've been in touch with Mr. Deranian and he's on his way.
I'll be home if you need me, Sheriff.
Tia, we've gotta think of something fast.
Hey, Tony, look.
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy.
Tia, we need my harmonica.
Now open the cell door.
When I get the star case, you run out to the edge of the woods.
As soon as I free the bear, I'll be there.
Tia, how do you expect us to get anyplace with a great big bear?
He's counting on me.
But this is an emergency.
Come off it, will you?
We still have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you start thinking about that?
Hey. Hey, what?
Get that thing off of me!
I just hope we don't have to pass a zoo before we get where we're going.
Look, I know what I saw!
And I say there's only one explanation!
Those two kids are witches!
And they're from Witch Mountain.
I want every available townsman to arm themselves, and we'll divvy up into hunting groups.
Hey, Sheriff. Whatcha gonna do, chase them all the way to Witch Mountain?
Yeah!
We'll stop them before they get there!
Now you listen close and I'll give you the areas to cover.
Those look like hunting parties.
They got away, Mr. Deranian, but we know what they are.
Evil itself. We got to catch them.
He's right. They're from Witch Mountain.
Sheriff, we need some more ammunition.
All right.
We'll get them, Mr. Deranian.
They've really got blood in their eyes.
There's no use trying to reason with them now, sir.
Security? This is Deranian.
I want a complete check on a Jason O'Day.
Tia, I know how you feel about the bear, and I think he's real neat too, but...
Well, a lot of people are gonna be looking for us, and he'll be safer on his own.
Anyway, they might shoot him.
Just for the sport of it.
Look.
He'll be safe there until tonight.
Then he can move on when it's dark.
Maybe you're right. I'll talk to him.
You be a good bear and wait in that cave.
We don't want anything to happen to you.
Tony, his feelings were hurt.
Watch it!
Jason!
Oh!
These woods are full of hunters looking for you. They think you're witches.
Brother Hiram ain't home, but I'll get you some food.
You'll have a good rest.
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day.
244 Cahill, just north of Longview.
Fifteen minutes.
We can be there in 15 minutes.
But I still can't figure out why we both came up with a name like "Castaway."
I noticed that you two are very smart for your years.
You really know what a "castaway" is?
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked and left on a desert island.
- Ah.
- Tony, I just remembered!
"Castaway." That's the name of someone we're supposed to see.
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing.
But suppose you two are castaways?
Then it would sure fit things Tia's been remembering.
Uh-huh.
We were in some kind of wreck, Jason.
And we were in the sea.
You mean like a boat sinking?
I guess. But if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.
We had an uncle.
Uncle Bene.
He kept us afloat. And then he drowned.
Oh.
For a long time we didn't understand anything anyone would say.
You must have come from some other country.
But we won't know all the truth until we get to the mountains above Stony Creek.
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.
My brother Hiram mentioned that place to me in his letters.
He said some strangers came and settled there, kept pretty much to themselves, and nobody ever knew where they came from.
You think they might be your people?
They must be!
Security? Have you notified Mr. Bolt of our destination?
Then do so.
We've just received communication from Mr. Deranian, sir.
He's on his way to a Mr. Hiram O'Day's cabin in the hills north of Longview.
- Don't just sit here, get going!
- Yes, sir.
Well, when Hiram gets home he's gonna find his cupboard is bare.
Gotta get going.
Come on, camper's out in back.
Tia!
Can you hear me?
We need another favor.
- Tia, come on.
- Come on, Tia.
There's no way we can get by them without their seeing us.
I remember more.
It wasn't just Uncle Bene who died in the ocean when our ship went down, a lot of other people died too.
And those people, the people that live here in these mountains, well, all of us came from the same country, but on different ships.
Why then now, you mean yours sank, and the others made it to port?
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place.
Yeah, a place that isn't there anymore.
Castaways?
That's why my people called themselves that, and...
And this was the emblem for where we used to live.
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.
It wasn't called that.
No. Two stars...
Because our world had two suns!
- Double stars!
- Another planet!
A whole other solar system!
Well, then... It wasn't a boat.
It was a spaceship!
Our planet was dying.
The only industry left was the manufacturing of spaceships.
Like ours.
And we had to find another planet to live on.
Then the other ships in your cluster landed here in these mountains, and yours didn't make it.
I think we might have been the only ones on our spaceship to have survived.
We lost them again.
We're going to go south on highway
211. Why don't you search the north?
Not too many people around, are there?
"Misty Valley Cooperative." This is it.
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.
We'll wait.
Are you the Longview bunch chasing after those two witch kids?
That's right, mister.
My name's Cort. You the guy's putting up the reward or what?
Yes, that's right.
Except that it's now $5,000.
- Five thousand, huh?
- But there's a catch.
I want those two children alive. I don't care what happens to the old man.
They were last seen in a camper headed this way.
Those words got a mighty good sound, friend.
Any idea where to look for them?
Well, they're not around here.
That's for sure.
Maybe the next town up the line.
Stony Creek?
Stony Creek?
We're changing course now.
They sure had time enough for a lunch break.
There's something to do with the phone book.
Let me have another look at that map.
Misty Valley Cooperative.
I was calling the Castaway family and I was wondering if...
It's all right.
Were you looking for Mr. Castaway?
Yes!
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!
- Is this Tony?
- Yes.
- Is Tia with you?
- Yes. Who is this?
Thank the blessed stars!
We've been searching for you for years.
Now listen carefully.
Everything must time out.
Take the back door and go to Mr. O'Day's camper.
Children, we want to make sure
Mr. Deranian doesn't lose you.
We have a plan that should discourage them from ever pursuing you again.
Come on! Come on!
Everything's all right, Jason.
You've got a funny idea of what's "all right."
Maybe Bolt can spot the RV from the helicopter.
Hey, men, come on!
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon. Headed north.
There's no way he can lose us in that monster he's driving.
Close in on them.
He's not exactly crawling.
They're getting closer, Tony.
Good driving, Al.
- How'd we wind up here?
- Another fine mess you...
- Come on, let's get out...
- Look out. The door!
Guys, let's go.
Very ingenious, Tony.
But don't forget, we want Deranian to see what's coming up.
I don't understand, sir.
Well, we have something planned that will convince Deranian and Bolt that you're both out of their reach forever.
Deranian, listen to me.
I spotted a route that lets you cut in ahead of them.
It's the second turn on the left.
Now signal the others not to follow you.
Repeat. Not.
Understood.
I don't believe it.
- It's what you call levitation.
- That ain't what I call it.
You two got powers beyond belief.
We're not doing this.
This is something too powerful for us to do.
Somebody else is making this happen.
Whoee!
That thing's flying upside down.
That's impossible.
That kind of vehicle can't fly upside down.
It's not supposed to fly at all.
They're not upside down. We are.
The voice says we should get out here and wait.
We'll never forget you, Jason.
Would you take care of Winkie?
Oh, no. Winkie's your cat.
It wouldn't be right for her to be with anybody else.
It would make us happy.
It sure would.
And I think Winkie would like it too.
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie how she feels about that.
Winkie, how do you feel about going around now with a crusty old man?
Look, if you don't mind...
I'd like to plan on, uh, remembering you two as if you were my kids.
The kids I never had.
Uncle Bene! Uncle Bene!
Uncle Bene!
Oh, you all did so well.
Congratulations, Jason O'Day.
You're a man of courage and compassion.
Uncle Bene, we thought you'd drowned.
Well, now if you know exactly what to say to a shark, he can be very accommodating.
Ah, Tia.
You never forgot.
You didn't lose the star case.
We only found the map a few days ago.
Well, I knew when you were old enough to understand it, you'd find it.
It's good to know that there are
Earth men such as you, Mr. O'Day.
If the stars are willing, perhaps some of the other children who survived will find men equally as kind.
- There are more?
- Yes.
All with star cases and maps.
So far, only Tia and Tony have found the way.
Well, now that I know what to keep my eyes peeled for, perhaps I could spot these surviving kids and bring them here.
Deranian's car.
I'll have to tend to Bolt's helicopter.
Stay and watch.
You'll see how we came into this world of yours.
What!
Stop this thing!
I'm all right! Where are the children?
I should've known there was more than ESP with those two.
Well, they're home now.
Have I intrud...
No, I didn't.
I didn't.
How dare you?!
I loved that gold watch!
All right, all right!
It wasn't a gold watch!
Yeah?
What... she looks like?
Hair?
Blond, stringy.
It's dirty probably.
Never washes it.
Eyes... blue.
Big blue eyes.
I think she's really very stupid, yes.
She looks stupid.
Stupid girl, yes.
Her nose has no character.
A punk nose.
Mouth is too tiny.
Narrow mouth.
Legs are alright.
Bosom?
She has no bosom.
No bosom at all.
Stop that!
You're very rude.
She has a very vivid imagination.
You know, she hears things.
Names... machine guns...
God knows what.
She thinks there's a war going on.
That's not all.
A little while ago...
...she thought she saw an unicorn.
Yes, I tell you.
Unicorn.
Of course it doesn't exists.
Anyway, it's a very insipid animal.
Oh God, she's moving about again.
Very curious.
What can I do?
She ran away...
The lady upstairs... she's dead.
But you don't hear me.
She's very dead.
No, you don't understand.
My name is Lily.
I see. Lily is your name too.
Funny. You spell it differently.
Who is he?
I'm sorry.
Your sister.
Yes, of course.
Your sister Lily.
But your mother is dead.
She passed away, I tell you.
She is dead! And I want you to know that it was not my fault!
Let me out!
Open the door!
Open it!
You! It's all your fault!
I'm not gonna stay on top here for very long. Do you understand?
If you think that you can keep me here forever, you're wrong!
Let me get out right away!
Right away! Let me out!
Help!
Someone!
You're really awful!
I hate you!
You stupid old bitch!
All right! If that what you want, don't let me out!
Don't! I don't care!
I hate you!
That...
- Hope.
- Hope.
Night of love... around us.
Eyes, days, stars shines for all remembered... in one slow breath.
- Merged.
- Merged... in one slow breath.
- But...
- The day hailed away... with all his gleam.
Mighty death.
- Magical.
- Magical death... threatening my life.
- How could my love die...
How could the endlessly living perish?
Yearning eternal blindness, where forever love and rapture await.
Heart on heart.
Mouth on mouth.
All is illusion.
Set us free of this world.
Dream of fire endless promise.
Our hearts wonder wish,
As full death, men named it evermore, beautiful delusion.
Sweet awaited desire.
Never waking.
Never fearing, nameless there.
Each to each, belonging.
With love alone, all life source.
Would you please tell me what's going on around here?
What?
They've taken the city.
Oh wooden horse, my God.
And Brian? Brian is dead you say?
What about Helen?
Hello?
Hello?
That radio gotta be fixed.
The girl.
She just lost her bloomers and now she's eating the cheese.
Of course, there was Christmas cheese.
I know what you think about.
I don't like it.
She'll find out about the greeks.
Come here dear!
Come, come, my little one.
I'll explain everything to you now.
Every single thing you want to know.
Don't! Don't!
There's nothing to see over there.
Oh no.
Please don't go near the window.
It's not safe!
She's looking out, the silly little bitch!
Damnit! I told you this would happen!
She's a conniving little slut!
I always knew it...
She's making a dash for the door.
Of course it's closed!
She's trying to open it, she's kicking it.
Now she's coming back, the little...
She just fell...
Now she's off the window...
Have you seen a unicorn?
Have you seen a unicorn?
Have you seen a unicorn?
Where is that unicorn?
Answer me!
Out, out, brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow.
Stupid, stupid tree.
Did you say something?
I said you're mean.
What do you mean 'mean'?
Why are you keep running after me?
I find it rather tedious.
What is it you want exactly?
I don't know really, but I'm not mean.
You're not?
What about those poor children...
I just saw you beating up?
- I'm not...
- Shut up, let me speak!
I saw how you kick that tree... and trampled those innocent flowers to death.
And you dare to say you're not mean?
You should practice what you preach!
You're eating the flowers.
Suppose we change the subject?
I don't mean to be rude, but you're not very graceful.
In my books, unicorns are slim and white.
The most beautiful things in the world are the most useless.
Peacocks and lillies, for instance.
You know, the old lady upstairs.
She doesn't want me to see you.
Oh Lord, you mean that babbling-beady-on-the-while upstairs.
Don't pay any attention to her.
She's not even real.
What do you mean she's not real?
I touched her, I spoked her, I even saw her die.
I mean what I mean.
Little one, I could give you some precious information... concerning that old hag.
Lunatic driving baddie.
I'm leaving right away.
And I won't be back in 154 years.
Hey, come back!
I like talking to you.
Nobody talks to me here.
Humphrey.
What's the matter?
What's the matter now?
Who's Humphrey?
- You mean the rat?
- Yes, I mean the rat.
Did you had a fight?
Yes, but that's nothing new.
He's so opinionated and stubborn.
I love him, you understand my sweet thing?
We went in so many roads together.
So many seasons I've seen us passed.
So many hopes...
I see the waves in the ocean.
Hungry, hungry.
Just a minute, please.
Just a minute.
I'm afraid I don't have much milk.
Hey! Your friend is back.
Willy boy, Willy boy,
Where are you going?
I'll go with you, if I may.
I'm going to the meadow to see them...
I'm going to help them make the hay.
I'm going to help them fill the barn,
with summer hay to lay upon.
Nobody home
No bread, no drink, no money how we none
yet we shall be bliss.
Nobody home.
No bread, no drink, no money how we none.
yet we shall be bliss.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Is nobody's there?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Anybody hear me?
Just a minute, please.
What is it?
What is that light?
I don't know.
You stay right here, Edna.
Don't leave the house.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
Come on, Dutch.
Chicken.
Holy mackerel!
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother Ship.
This is Earth Probe Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
This is Mother Ship.
Have you completed emergency landing?
Affirmative, Mother.
Request repair party.
Negative, Zunar J5. You'll have to effect emergency repairs yourself.
And rendezvous with us at grid dissect
8304 at 69 hours minus 17.
- That's an awfully tight squeeze.
- Unavoidable, Zunar.
Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.
- Days?
- Years.
Good luck, Zunar J5.
Over and out.
Yeah. So long, Mother.
I don't see any hammer and sickle, do you, Colonel?
Maybe it's on the inside, General.
No sign of life, either.
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.
I want to speak to the chiefs, Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Rover?
Wipe it out of your minds.
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll want them later.
Take their names. Colonel.
Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Names?
- Charlie Cooney.
General Stilton!
We're ready when you are, sir.
- Bullhorn.
- Yes, sir.
On to Hopscotch.
All right, men.
Let's move it!
- Let's move out. Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
When we get to Hopscotch,
I want mark-four priority security.
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.
And not one word to public relations.
Not one word.
You got that, Colonel?
Yes, sir.
You got that, Captain?
- Yes, sir. Sergeant?
- Got it.
Well?
It's a brilliant technological achievement.
It's state of the art.
You trying to tell me something,
Allison?
- It's definitely not one of ours, General.
- How about Russia?
Certainly not Russia.
It's far beyond...
OK, Allison. Lay it on the line.
Whose is it?
I don't know, General.
We'd better find out. I wanna know who made it, flew it and where it came from.
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Contact SigCom on our radio.
Get Hungerford at Air.
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins,
Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.
- Get them IQs off their tennis courts.
- Yes, sir.
Double pronto!
If we don't find out where that thing came from, this country could be in trouble, big, big trouble.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
You say it's not man-made, Allison.
What's that leave us?
Outer space.
With no sign of the pilot.
Big, big trouble.
While you and I are talking this very minute, some slimy green-headed 12-legged creep could be crawling into the White House.
Big, big trouble.
We're up against genius.
We'd better come up with some genius of our own.
I believe, General, you've already met my assistant, Dr. Corday.
I'd like to introduce some members of our team.
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's our expert on fossil fuel.
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett, who heads Thermal.
Huh.
Dr. Norman Link, who's been doing some intriguing work in garbage research.
- So what?
- Dr. Link.
Just a second, Dr. Heffel. I have to relay some vital information to a colleague.
Oh, yes. This is our hard-water man,
Dr. Leach.
Right, Ernie. The Lakers by a point and a half for 100 bucks.
When will you have the line on Philly and the New York Knicks?
I'd like you to meet Mr. Jurist, who also is involved in Thermal.
And there's Dr. Banford, Professor
Epstein, Doctors Davidson and Barrett.
And, of course, this is Dr. Humphrey, our head of Nuclear.
Mr. Stallwood, our head of Procurement and Supplies. What are you doing here?
When the call went out for an emergency meeting, I naturally assumed...
You assumed wrong. Scientists.
Double-A clearance only. Out.
- But I might have a contribution.
- If we need any pencils, I'll send for you.
- But, Dr. Heffel...
- Out.
Sorry, General. Where was I?
Oh, yes. Professor...
Dr. Heffel, I didn't come for a roll call,
I came to pick brains. Are they all here?
- Yes. These are our top people.
- Then let's get to it!
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.
Dr. Link.
That's it, Professor.
I'll call tomorrow with more input. Bye.
All right, Sergeant. Open it.
Drapes.
Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is top secret.
The United States government will countenance no leaks.
Now.
What's holding it up?
- Nothing.
- It's amazing.
- Where did you get it?
- What is it?
A propulsion unit of some sort, ladies and gentlemen.
Never mind where we got it.
We have other experts working on that.
What we want to know from you is, what makes it tick?
OK. Let's have your hypothesis.
Uh, the energy source could be atomic.
We've checked on that.
Negative.
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...
- Checked out. Negative.
- Oh.
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Jellyfish calling Olympus.
Come in, Olympus.
Mr. Olympus?
This is Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something very big and very...
Jellyfish.
Your man in ERL?
Yes, sir. That Jellyfish.
I think I'm on to something.
No, sir. I think you'll find this a great deal more interesting than my last report.
Right now, Dr. Heffel is in a secret meeting with a four-star general and a whole gaggle of scientists.
What are they meeting about?
I don't know, sir, it's a secret.
Get in there and find out?
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?
Not a guess, a solid premise?
Do you? Well?
Do you think it might be fruitful to bring
Dr. Wilson into this discussion, Dr. Heffel?
- Wilson?
- Yes.
He might very well come up with an applicable theory.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Who's Dr. Wilson?
- He's in my carpool. Oh...
That is, we live in the same building.
- That certainly qualifies him.
- Oh.
No.
What I'm trying to say is, he's a very bright young physicist who's come here recently on loan from Caltech.
A loan, I might add, that is bearing absolutely no interest.
He's a little unorthodox, but a brilliant theorist.
- General Stilton isn't interested in...
- Get him.
- What?
- Get him.
His output couldn't be any less than what we've gotten so far.
Yes, General.
He really has an unusual mind.
- Well, Dr. Wilson?
- It's beautiful.
Don't you have any other observation?
- Only that it looks like an artichoke.
- We know it looks like an artichoke.
What makes it tick?
Mayonnaise?
Negative.
No, I was only joking, sir.
I do have a theory, sir, actually, in line with the work I've been doing.
I have a hunch it's tapping the primal mainstream.
The primal mainstream?
It's everywhere, only on different frequencies.
The whole electromagnetic spectrum -
Cosmic, gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio waves.
Do you know how much we finite human beings can tune into with our senses?
Less than five percent.
The universe makes its own energy.
We even make it ourselves.
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.
If I taped terminals to your head, General, your brain could run an electric train.
- Electric train?
- I'm sorry, General.
Perhaps electric train wasn't the most apt example.
Thank you very much.
- Let me have that for a couple of months...
- Thank you.
A couple of months?
Dr. Heffel?
- Yes, General?
- I want action.
You know, Drexel, I've seen the most amazing thing. Amazing.
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.
Thank you, Drexel.
Well.
How did you get in here? Huh?
Now look, you're asking for trouble.
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy about animals in the building.
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about people in the building either.
What's your name, huh?
Charlie? Cuddles? Jake?
Yes, yes. You look like Jake.
That, Jake, is the Van Allen belt.
Oil and coal is not going to do it, you know.
And, one of these days, that sun of ours is going to turn into a big black hole.
You know where it's really at, Jake?
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.
You know, it's crazy, but you almost look like you know what I'm talking about.
All right, give me a hand with this,
Sergeant. Easy, easy. That's it.
Stallwood, administration emergency!
That's some fancy collar you got there.
Maybe I'll take you home with me.
My neighbor Liz has a cat named Lucybelle. She's really cute.
And the cat's not bad either.
Liz! Hi.
Ouch! I've...
- We were just talking about you.
- Were you?
This is Jake.
I'm going to take him home with us.
You won't have to drive Professor Link and myself home tonight.
- Heffel's called a late meeting.
- I can wait.
That won't be necessary.
- How about a coffee?
- No.
- Chocolate chip cookie?
- No.
- Are you sore or something?
- Sore? Sore?
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- What is it? What did I do?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Mayonnaise?
Electric trains?
Well, now, look, really, all that... that was just a joke, Doctor.
Well, nobody laughed, especially the general.
Has he had water?
- The general?
- The cat.
Oh. Water?
Cats do get thirsty, you know.
Do you have a bowl?
A bowl? Right here, yes. Here.
- Water?
- Yes, right, water.
Look, Liz... Dr. Bartlett.
Just because some general lacks a sense of humor, that's no reason...
- All I was trying to convey...
- I'm really not interested, Doctor.
Besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that the magnitude of what the general showed us just bowled me over.
- It did?
- Oh, completely.
- Black.
- What?
- Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?
- Right. Check. Coming right up.
I really don't understand, that's all.
The man who wrote the article you did for The Scientific Quarterly...
- You read it?
- Well, of course. It was brilliant.
I've been wanting to tell you.
We don't get much chance to talk in the car pool, but I've been following your work.
- You have?
- Closely.
It's very impressive, very innovative, very attractive.
I mean, it's bound to attract attention.
Oh, well, um,
I am writing an article at the moment and I would love to have your criticism.
Oh. Maybe at lunch or, even better, at dinner sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that. When?
- Tonight?
No, that's right, you've got that late meeting.
That may not go all that late.
I should be out by seven. Is that too late?
- Seven's beautiful.
- Good.
Well...
Oh, thanks for the coffee.
It was delicious.
- I think she digs you.
- I sure hope so.
- Who said that?
- I did.
Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down. We've gotta talk.
I'm running out of time, and you're the only one I can depend on to help me.
- It's you?
- It's not the mouse. Now, sit down.
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.
Thought transference. Nothing exceptional where I come from. Now, sit.
My name is Zunar J5/9 Doric 4-7.
Zunar...?
Why don't we just stay with Jake, OK?
Frank, last night at 03 hours plus 13,
I made an emergency landing in a spaceship from another galaxy.
That so-called artichoke... it's from my craft.
But... you're a cat.
Granted. But you see, in our civilization, that's as far as we needed to evolve.
We developed our brain to a fine point.
Now, man rose off his four legs and developed tools, machinery, agriculture and a chronic pain in his lower back.
We developed tools for the mind. This collar here, it amplifies brain power.
- It does what?
- Well, it provides energy by which we...
Look, let me give you a demonstration.
Not a bad little tune.
Mm-mmm.
Frank, this is really delicious.
What is it?
Oh, it's chopped kidney.
It's all they had at the deli.
It really hits the spot. I'm gonna take a couple of cases for my trip back.
Sure beats the blah I've been eating.
Well, now back to my problem.
Frank, I need an answer.
- What do you say?
- Say about what?
Can I count on you to help me repair my spaceship?
- Why me?
- Because I like the way you think.
Your equations rather interest me. In fact, they're really not bad at all... for a human.
- Really? I'm on the right track?
- Quite definitely, but years away from a solution.
Frank, on my planet, we have an expression - you rub my fur, I'll rub yours.
How would you like to make a quantum jump?
You help me, and I'll give you a push in the right direction.
- You're serious?
- I'm serious.
- You really are from outer space?
- I am from outer space.
- Even though you're a cat?
- Frank! Is it a deal?
It's a deal. Oh, that's...
We better move. I've got to make repairs to my ship by 5:13 Sunday for liftoff, or I'll miss the rendezvous with the mother ship.
Right. I'll get my sweater.
Uh, do you think that you can find your way back to that airport?
No problem.
I made a memory imprint.
- With the collar?
- Right.
Fantastic.
How developed does your brain have to be to use that collar?
Not very.
In fact, you could handle it.
You wanna try?
Do we have time?
Why not?
Look, just grab hold of it.
Easy. Don't take it off.
Without it, I'm just an average cat.
Right.
- Right. OK?
- OK.
- Now just concentrate.
- Concentrate.
Think levitation.
Levitation.
You're as light as a feather.
Look at me. I'm floating!
It's just plain incredible!
- Look, one hand.
- You're losing your concentration.
Yeah.
Hi, Frank. Gotta use your set.
The ball goes crosscourt to Brown. He brings it...
- What were you doing up in the air?
- Uh...
- Astronaut exercises.
- Oh.
- Link, I'm busy.
- Yeah. Well, just forget I'm here.
The last minute of the game, and Francine throws me out of the apartment.
Why does she throw me out?
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.
- When did you get a cat?
- Jake's not my cat. He's just visiting.
- Hi, Jake.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Do you mind, Frank?
Remember. The score's tied at 108. Atlanta has the ball and a basket could win it.
Win it? Oh, man! And I gave a point and a half. There goes my 100 bucks.
Come on, defense. Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...
The crowd is really on its feet now.
The guy in the corner.
He's alone and closely guarded by King.
King steals the ball. What a play.
Here come the Lakers.
Five seconds left.
Puts up a shot.
But a prayer. There's no chance.
Wait...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it. He scores!
He made it in the last second.
And the Lakers will win it by two.
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?
Yeah.
I'm really gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I could use another beer.
- I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.
- How about a ginger ale?
- I'm out of that, too.
- Could I at least finish my cigar?
- Link, please.
I'd like to have a little celebration.
I'll see you later.
The basketball game?
You did that?
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
It was the fastest way to get rid of that flake.
Let's go.
It's less than 36 hours to liftoff.
Right. Oh...
Do you think I ought to carry you, so people don't suspect you're not an ordinary cat?
Good thinking, Frank. Besides, my left paw's been acting up again.
- An old football injury?
- Actually, no. Polo.
Now let's go.
What about getting into Hopscotch?
It'll be guarded.
- I'll handle that, too.
- It's fantastic.
Hi. Hi, this is Lucybelle.
What'd you say you call him?
- Jake.
- Jake, right.
Jake, this is Lucybelle. I thought they could get acquainted while we're at dinner.
- At dinner?
- Yeah.
It was tonight, wasn't it?
Right. Right, yes.
I was just about to call you.
Something came up. I'm afraid you're going to have to give me a rain check.
Oh.
Oh, well, of course.
It really doesn't matter.
But it does.
It matters a lot, Liz. Dr. Bartlett.
You see, what happened was...
It's Jake. He took sick.
Suddenly. Out of the blue.
Really? What is it?
I think it's, uh, Tasmanian Croup.
You poor thing.
You know, he sounds terrible.
You'd better not let her get too close.
Stop milking it.
- What?
- I said I was about to rush him to the vet's.
The vet. That's a good idea, Frank.
D'you know there's a very good vet who lives in the building? A Dr. Wenger.
He specializes in cats.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at him.
Jake prefers a general practitioner.
I'm sorry about dinner. I'll make it up to you.
- How about a picnic?
- Tomorrow?
- You handled that very well.
- I didn't enjoy lying to Liz.
She's a very unusual person.
- Her kitty-cat's not too bad either.
- There's plenty of time for that.
That's all right for you to say. But I've been confined to a spaceship for five months.
Ohh...
- The ship's in that big hangar.
- Oh.
There's got to be a way in.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- Come on, come on.
- Right, right.
The coast is clear. Let's go!
There she is.
Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming, Frank!
- I know, I know.
What's happening?
It's all clear.
- Let's go!
- It's this way.
Forget it. It wears off in 20 minutes.
He won't remember a thing.
Come on, let's go.
Incredible.
An older model, but in pretty good shape for a rig with nearly a trillion miles on it.
Now let's see about getting it operational again. We've only got 34 hours left.
Right. Through here?
Hm-hm. Put me down.
Oh, it's just incredible.
The artichoke.
I was right.
- What's this... control panel?
- Uh-huh. Sort of.
- And this?
- Uh, computer.
- Then this must be the readout.
- Frank, later.
I'll explain it all later, I promise.
- First, disengage the transducer system.
- How?
Take that neo-mag intercog, and you'll find the transducer switch on top of the ship.
Just coordinate with me.
Well, how do I get up there?
- Fly.
- Fly? You mean use your collar?
Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.
Concentrate, and when you get on top, engage the switch with the intercog and thought-project "seven max triad. "
- Seven max triad.
- Right. The computer will do the rest.
Seven max triad. Right.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?
Frank?
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.
Right. Go ahead.
- It's in.
- OK. Thought-project.
Seven max triad.
OK, Frank. Come on down.
Amazing.
I was afraid of that. The focal terminal on the microtransformer's vaporized.
- You're sure?
- Positive. But I'll double-check.
- Just what I thought.
- That's where the focal terminal goes?
Acts as a catalyzer.
I'll need a small amount of org 12.
- What's org 12?
- What the focal terminal's made of.
About six cubits ought to be enough.
You don't have org 12 on this planet?
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?
You probably call it by a different name.
Stand back. I'll run it through the computer.
Hey, Tom! You all right?
Tom!
Org 12... ductile yellow metallic element.
Melting point - 1.063.
Tensile strength - 19.000.
- Tensile strength what?
- 19.000.
Atomic weight - 196.967.
Wait a minute.
That's the atomic weight of gold.
Wow!
Out! Out!
Everybody out!
What is that?
Come on, let's go.
Follow me!
Holy cow.
- Give my collar room.
- You can't zap the whole base.
Let's get out of here.
Over here! Follow me!
Move out!
Watch it!
Come back here!
Where are you going?
Come out of there.
You're under arrest!
Look out!
What is it?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
Was anybody in there?
Back it out. Look out. Who's driving?
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
- Yes, sir?
- Who sounded that alarm?
I did, sir.
We have an intruder, and his cat.
Cat? Cat? Cat?
Yes, sir. Here's his collar.
Jake!
Excuse me.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Frank, shut up and move this thing.
- That's him, sir!
- Halt!
Get that thing out of here!
Get it out!
Move it out!
Whoa!
- Now what do we do?
- Now you hang on.
17 times...
Um, five of...
Now cosine of...
Yeah. Uh...
This is even better than the stuff
I had last night. What's it called?
- Tuna.
- Tuna? Love it.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?
According to your figures, we're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.
- So?
- So?
Jake, forgetting the money, which I can't forget, you know how much gold that is?
It's that much.
And you want to put it in a space that big?
You folks are still operating on the bulk system.
I'll reduce it to the size I need and still retain all its properties.
- How?
- I'll get into that later. First buy the gold.
Buy it? Jake, in order to buy $120,000's worth of gold, you need $120,000.
- So? Is that a problem?
- A prob...?
My entire capital is tied up in my next paycheck.
- Then what's the alternative?
- I don't know what...
Hi.
- Traditionally known in horse racing...
- Oh, boy.
- What are you doing?
- Borrowing your TV.
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.
Hi, Jake.
Link...
Wife's worked out an equitable TV schedule.
The Peachtree Derby and the football game's on your set, and the opera on mine.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Doing what... playing with your pussycat?
- Link...
- Franklin, please.
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.
We've got problems to solve, things to do.
What?
- Link, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- Sshh!
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?
No.
- Come on, Sweet Jake. Let's go.
- Sweet Jake?
Yeah. It's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, and I'm gonna be 1500 in front, and you'll be licking mackerel fillet.
Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already? Never mind, I'll get it.
- I'll try to get rid of him.
- Wait a minute.
Did you hear what he said? If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.
- So?
- So if Link can win $1500, why can't we win 120,000?
No. Wait a minute. He just made a bet.
He could win 1500. It doesn't mean he will.
With me on his side, he will.
- Did you say something?
- Hmm? No, nothing.
OK, OK. Let's pipe down.
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.
And they're off.
It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.
Attaboy Star.
Daddy's Poppa on the outside.
- Booky Baby on the rail and...
- Where's Sweet Jake?
Sweet Jake is still in the gate.
At the clubhouse turn. It's Denny's Doll by half a length. Attaboy Star.
Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.
Sweet Jake is moving.
He's way behind. But he's moving.
Uh-oh. I think he stopped to have lunch.
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!
See what I mean?
Sweet Jake! I should have bet on the Metropolitan Opera.
It's Attaboy Star by a length.
Booky Baby. Denny's Doll and Seabottom.
Sweet Jake's finished eating and started running.
And. Ladies and gentlemen. Is he running.
But not even Silky Sullivan could come from this far behind.
It's Booky Baby taking the lead. Daddy's
Poppa moving into second. Attaboy Star.
And making up incredible ground is Sweet Jake.
I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?
At the top of the stretch. It's Booky Baby in the lead. Daddy's Poppa.
And turning for home. It's Sweet Jake.
Come on, Jake. Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.
Attaboy. Here we go.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Jake.
Attaway. Come on, Jake.
Come on. Come on, boy! That's it! Hot dog!
We got it! Yahoo!
Yeeha!
The story here today.
Ladies and gentlemen. Is Sweet Jake.
1500 smackeroos!
That calls for another beer.
- How about you? I'm buying.
- No, thanks.
Oh, incidentally, Frank, you could use another six-pack.
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder them on the football games.
Frank, that's the solution to the money.
- No, no. It's ridiculous. It won't work.
- Why won't it?
I don't know anything about placing a bet.
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets. The
Rams-Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.
- We'll have to take in another partner.
- Who?
- Him.
- Did you say something, Frank?
- Link? Do you think that's wise?
- What's wise? Who are you talking to?
Ask how many football games we can bet on.
- Who are you talking to?
- Ask him!
- It's crazy.
- Buddy?
- Who?
- How many football games on TV today?
Three pro games.
East, Midwest, Far West. Who?
- Brief him.
- Have you got a tape machine going?
I don't think it's a good idea, but OK.
You know, I'd say you were talking to the cat.
I was.
Right.
Look, Frank, this can happen to anybody in government service.
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
- Link. Take a deep breath.
- OK.
- Remember that artichoke?
- Uh-huh.
Well, it all started when this spaceship...
- Spaceship?
... from another galaxy landed in a field.
Frank, let me get this straight, OK?
Now, you're trying to tell me that your little pussycat came from another planet from another galaxy in a spacecraft and landed on Earth?
- Is that it?
- That's right.
- You're squeezing.
- See? You heard him talk.
Uh-huh. Look.
I mean, I don't know how you're doing your little trick, you know.
But I gotta tell you something, it's dumb.
Very dumb. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna drink your last beer, watch three football games on your television set, and then I'm going home, because this is dumb, Frank. Real dumb.
Now, that's dumb.
Aw, Link, look.
Listen to me for one minute.
I don't want to hear it, Frank.
I don't want to hear it, Frank!
- OK?
- OK.
Thank you.
That does it, Frank! I'm going home and watch the Metropolitan Opera.
Oh, now, Link. We need your help.
Jake needs your help!
I don't want to hear about it!
You're the only person I know who knows how to place a bet. I don't anything about...
What kind of a spaceship?
You're beautiful.
You're down 200, sucker.
Would you like to double it?
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.
Weasel speaking. What's your pleasure?
Yeah. Give me four balls.
I'll double it.
- What do you say, Sarasota Slim?
- I say give him five.
The man says give him five.
You got it. Honest Harry holds.
Link, can you make it fast?
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.
- Can I trust him?
- Would a crook be named Honest Harry?
You wanna bet what?
Hold on.
- Hey, Ernie. Ernie, come here.
- Yeah.
Link wants to take his winnings from Sweet
Jake and parlay the three football games.
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?
Yeah. It'll come to 120 G's if he makes it.
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.
- He's down.
- You're down.
Hold it right there.
General? General?
Fingerprints, sir. They found fingerprints.
On top of the hull, inside the cabin.
And they are the prints of a human being.
So whatever power brought this ship here was aided by some disloyal American.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with a collaborator.
I want the face that matches these prints.
Use the computer.
- Double pronto, sir.
- General!
General!
- Look at this. They found more.
- What in blazes is that?
Fine hair, sir.
The pilot was wearing a fur coat.
Even more important, we found tiny prints in a claw-like pattern, like a pussycat's.
Pussycat? Why aren't I hearing some tickety-tacks? What about the fingerprints?
- There's a printout about to come through.
- Sir.
What do you want me to do with this?
- Get it checked, sir.
- Coming through, sir.
"ID - Wilson, Frank. Doctor.
Social Security, 631-07-0829."
"1951 to '55. US Navy.
'55 to '62 Caltech. "
"Current employment, theoretician. " ERL?!
- That's my Dr. Wilson!
- The scoundrel.
We'll have him in the slammer within the hour.
And blow the whole ball game?
Gentlemen, we're after Mr. Big, and this double-crossing fink is gonna lead us to him. To find the rat, tail the cat.
- Cat?
- It's just an expression.
- Want a peanut, Jake?
- No, thanks. I'll wait till Frank gets back.
- The Rams still ahead?
- Ahead? The Rams won the game.
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.
Let's open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?
- Did you get some more of that tuna?
- Yeah, yeah. Coming right up.
There's the two-minute warning.
Oilers leading 21- 19. Houston driving.
Another one in the bag.
- Come in.
- Frank?
Uh-huh?
Hi. Lucybelle insisted on coming, too.
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.
Oh, the picnic.
- Beer, Liz?
- No, thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh...
- Is his croup worse?
- Whose?
- Jake's.
- Oh.
Yeah. Right.
I was up all night.
- Really?
- It's gone into hyperzemia.
What's hyperzemia?
- It's what Jake's got.
- What did your doctor do for him?
- Gave him two aspirin.
- Two aspirin?
- What's that? What's happening, Frank?
- I don't know.
Two aspirin.
No wonder you're feeling worse.
- How did he get the ball?
- Interception.
- What this cat needs is some expert help.
- Get him.
- Dr. Wenger.
- Get him.
OK. I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.
Get him.
Somebody tackle him.
- Hi, sweetie. Can I get you anything?
- OK. Out of bounds on the 30.
Jake, why didn't you do something?
And spoil everybody's fun?
Look, guys, there's plenty of time.
You've got terrific whiskers.
Jake, will you pay attention? They're within field-goal range. If they make it, we're sunk.
No problem. Believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?
Oh, Jake, concentrate, please.
The next few seconds could be crucial.
- Time out.
- I appreciate it, Doctor.
At least you could have waited till the game was over. I have $10 on Chicago.
- You've got it on. What's happening?
- Time out.
This is Dr. Wenger.
Dr. Wenger, here's the patient.
I definitely think he needs your attention.
All right.
- How did they get to the 30?
- Interception.
- Happened while we were in the elevator.
- ... or a field goal?
What do you think?
- I think they should try for a field goal.
- About the cat.
Hmm? Oh, he's tense, he's very tense.
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.
- Where do you want to examine him?
- Right here will be fine.
OK. Let me get this out of the way.
Also, let's, first thing, get this collar off.
Hey!
Good thinking, Chicago.
This year. He's never missed inside the 35-yard line.
- Get through that line now.
- That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.
Block that kick. Block that kick.
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.
Jake, you better do something.
- Where's his collar?
- Block that...
- It's right here, Frank.
- Huh?
- Give it to me, Liz. Give it to me.
- Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...
- I'm gonna give him a sedative.
- No, don't do that!
Frank, let go of the cat.
There's the snap. It's down.
The kick is up.
It's long enough.
It's straight enough. It's...
It's...
It's flat!
I've never seen anything like it. The ball flattened out in midair. There's the gun.
- Jake?
- The Oilers have won it 21- 19.
I told you not to do that!
I only came here as a favor to a neighbor.
As a rule, I do not make house calls.
You sure picked a dumb time to break your rule.
Dr. Link!
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner.
Jake. Jake, it's me, Jake.
Oh, Frank, we're finished.
He's blotto.
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose. And where does that leave this poor little guy?
He's blown his rendezvous and my 1500 clams.
That was very rude, Frank.
- Liz, butt out.
- What?
- Cancel the bet. Call Ernie.
- He'll never buy it.
- Look, what's going on here?
- Jake, we got problems. Speak to me.
Is everybody crazy?
The line is busy.
We'll never get through. He's taking bets.
- We'd better get down there.
- Like yesterday.
Just a minute, Frank.
I would like... No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?
- Later, Liz.
- No. Now.
We have got exactly six minutes before that game starts.
- Watch it, Link. I'm a black belt.
- OK. We'll tell you in the elevator.
Remember that meeting we had with
Dr. Heffel and General Stilton at the ERL?
Outer space?
- Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?
- No, no. Remember that artichoke?
Dydee One calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.
This is Big Cheese. Go ahead, Dydee One.
Do you still have contact with the subject?
Yes, sir. Also that garbage expert and the dame from the car pool.
And they're all going into Earnest Ernie's pool hall. Looks like a Mafia tie-in.
Mafia?
What kind of an operation you running down there, Heffel?
Lucky!
Really lucky.
Ernie? Ernie?
Excuse me. Ernie?
- Hi, Ernie.
- Well, look who's here. Hiya, Doc.
Uh, Ernie,
I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.
- You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?
- Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.
Really? Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.
Hey, not a bad hunch.
The Chargers are ten points behind.
Already?
16, boss, 16.
Steelers just scored another one.
Sorry, Doc.
Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.
- Is that TV picture still out?
Well, there goes 120,000.
1500 of which is mine.
- Isn't there anything you can do?
- Not while Jake is out. Jake, wake up.
- Is he breathing?
- He's snoring.
OK. OK. Isn't there anything else we can bet on?
Yeah. Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?
- Next Sunday.
- Basketball?
- Tuesday night.
- Hockey?
- Hockey?
- Hockey.
Ernie, is there a hockey game today that we could put a few bucks on?
Sorry.
Horse race?
Boxing?
- Demolition derby? Anything to get even.
- No.
But if you want a little action, there's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.
- Sarasota Slim?
- Yes.
He indulges occasionally in a friendly pool game with a slight wager on the side.
- Nothing doing.
- Why not?
- He's a hustler.
- Who isn't?
OK. It's a bet.
What are the odds?
You against Sarasota Slim?
- Right.
- Frank.
Because I want to give you a chance to break even and because I like your style, let's say 8 to 1.
That's all?
What about him?
- Me?
- Link?
Well, considering the shape he's in,
I'd say maybe 10 to 1.
- Ohh. What about the lady?
- Me?
- Liz?
- Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.
- OK. You got a bet.
- Frank!
Arch, set 'em up.
Another sucker just swam into the net.
Frank, I don't know anything about this game.
Are you bananas? That guy can make a pool ball sit up and do the boogaloo.
I know, but I've got the equalizer... the collar.
- How are you gonna do that? Jake's out.
- I've used it, to repair the spaceship.
- You?
- Yes. I've flown.
Charlie, give me the special, and heavy on the onions.
- Taking a nap?
- Yeah.
Throw in a few chilli peppers, huh?
- Frank, I don't want to take the risk...
- Liz, you've got to do it.
I'm desperate. No money, no gold.
No gold, no liftoff. But...
But if we deliver, look what we get in return... the solution to half the problems on this planet.
- Just show me how to hold the pole.
- Good girl.
We need a stake. I've got about 12 bucks.
It's in my hip pocket. Will you get it for me?
- OK, that's 12. How much do you have?
- Me? I think I got 20.
- 20? Liz?
- Uh...
- I just have my mad money.
- Give it to us. Please?
Come on.
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.
I was going to buy a whole spring wardrobe, Link.
- OK. Ernie.
- Boss, here's the bankroll.
- Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.
- Check.
Not in your lifetime, Ernie.
Honest Harry holds.
All right, you want Honest Harry, you got Honest Harry.
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.
And here's our 300.
Earnest Ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.
Young lady, it's your break.
Come on, don't be so stingy with the onions.
Here, take the collar, Liz.
OK, here.
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...
Miss? Do you mind?
We're waiting.
Now, that's a sandwich. Right?
Right.
- Taking a nap.
- Naturally.
Nice break, young lady. Very nice.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,
but there's always tomorrow.
Show her how to do it.
OK, Slim, go get her.
Ooh, I can't watch this.
- Frank, I'm sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.
Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.
I guess we are licked.
If only Jake hadn't got knocked out...
Frank! Frank, look.
Jake!
Jake?
Frank, he must have just woke up.
- Jake, are you all right?
- Yeah. Where am I? What happened?
I'm Liz Bartlett.
I'm responsible for your being...
- Liz, Liz, sshh.
- Oh, well.
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.
That's money in the bank.
Look at it!
Honest Harry, guess who's here?
Ernie?
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
- No bet.
- No bet?
It's part of my code of ethics.
Always leave the sucker rent money.
That's not fair!
Honest Harry?
If the mark wants to go complete top city, he's got a constitutional right.
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?
It's ridiculous. But if I didn't have no principles, I'd say 100 to 1.
Suppose... Suppose she gives
Sarasota Slim 12 balls?
What a sense of humor!
300 to 1.
- And the break.
- The break?
500 to 1.
And blindfolded.
- What?
- Blindfolded!
- 2,000 to 1.
- You're on.
$60 at 2,000 to 1.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Are you seriously serious?
- You're not thinking of welching, are you?
- But I thought you was putting me on.
Earnest Ernie, it would not do your reputation any credit if word was to circulate that you reneged on a wager duly offered and accepted.
- Get the big bundle, Weasel.
- But, boss...
Get it!
All right.
Let me understand this.
Slim gets 12 balls and the break?
And she shoots blindfolded.
She'll never get to the table.
120 Gs, boss.
Don't put it away, Honest Harry, you ain't gonna hold it long.
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.
Nice. Nice break, Slim.
Unfortunately, you didn't sink nothing, but there's always tomorrow.
- I believe I'm up.
- Hold it. Blindfolded.
Oh.
Could you back off?
You did it, Jake.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
It was really nothing.
Thank you.
Frank, we won! Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, all of you. Thank you.
I'm sorry about things being upside down, but I took these pictures at risk of life and limb.
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?
Well, well.
What did you think of it, Mr. Olympus?
It's just mind-boggling, isn't it?
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?
Thank you, Omar.
Yes, Mr. Stallwood, you are quite correct.
It is "mind-boggling," as you so graphically put it.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control...
The world, sir?
The universe.
Oh, my!
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be out of place to suggest a bonus.
- A bonus?
- A small bonus.
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain the secret of that device, you may well become a very rich man.
I may?
Oh, sir, I... really may?
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.
I must have that collar.
I will have that collar.
OK. All set, General.
- Is it programmed?
- All the pertinent information fed in.
- Everything we know.
- Question number one, sir.
Question number one.
Who is the pilot?
It is a pussycat!
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.
Get on the ball, young man. Feed that information through again. Reassess.
Yes, sir.
- General Stilton, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?
That purchase Dr. Link made... we checked it out. It's a large quantity of gold.
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.
Radio.
This is Big Cheese calling
Dydee One. Where are you, Dydee One?
Outside the suspect's apartment.
Don't let them out of your sight.
Another printout, General.
Of all the...
Wait a minute. Radio.
- Dydee One.
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?
- Yes, sir, they did.
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
$120,000 in one lump sum.
Jake, how'd you like to hang around and watch me parlay this into a fortune?
- I wish I could hang around.
- I'm sorry, Jake. The time?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Lucy.
- I guess I'd better reduce the gold.
- Reduce it?
- What are you talking about?
- It's a new concept in calculating mass.
On Jake's planet, they use a system based on content, rather than on the quantitative...
Frank! You've got a whole lifetime to explain that. I've got less than an hour.
Now, stand back, everybody.
- All right, don't move! All hands in the air!
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Frank Wilson?
- You can't butt in here!
- Dr. Frank Wilson, you are under arrest.
- And the pussycat, General.
And the pussycat.
- Read them their rights, Colonel.
- Captain?
- Sergeant?
- Never mind.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right...
- Good heavens.
- Frank...
- What happened?
- They're frozen.
Holy mackerel!
Now they're on to us, how are we to get into
Hopscotch? You can't zap the whole base.
- Yeah, well, I'll think of something.
- They'll probably be on alert.
First things first.
Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll worry about getting on the base. Now stand back.
OK. Here goes.
Ohh.
That is unbelievable.
Oh, Jake.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.
No. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. I think I've got the perfect way to get us onto the base.
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in. Big Cheese.
Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
- What's the military doing here?
- This could be complicated, sir.
What isn't?
- Get that door closed!
- Uh-oh.
What does it all mean?
It means it's exceptionally complicated.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese. Come in.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Ah, here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.
- Wait. Hold Jake for a minute.
- Yes.
- How do I look?
- Could you hold Lucy for a minute?
- Do I look like a general?
- Oh, well...
Frank, you look very commanding.
- That'll have to do. Let's go.
- OK.
He got the cat.
That's the cat!
Where's the general going with those two?
That's the general?
It's not?
Open your door!
Open the doors!
Open the doors!
Halt! Halt in the name of the US...
Fantastic.
- Listen, good luck, huh?
- Yeah. Be careful.
- Bye, Lucybelle. Thanks for everything.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
Bye.
- They've escaped?
- Yes.
But, fortunately for us, they left something very valuable behind.
- General Stilton?
- Of course!
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?
- What do you think?
- Sorry, sir.
I want the hangar open. All personnel out.
We're moving the ship.
But sir, if we order 'em out of the hangar, how are you gonna...
- Soldier!
- Out of the hangar, sir. Yes, sir.
Get the hangar doors open. All personnel out of the hangar on the double.
- First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.
- Check.
...to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you're being...
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir.
Hold it right here, Frank.
130 to countdown.
Hurry. Insert the gold in the microtransformer.
Right, right.
- Got it.
- Good.
Now let's see if we have contact.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
- Where's the microphone?
- Frank!
OK, OK.
Zunar J5 calling Mother Ship.
Come in, Mother.
Hi there. Fella.
See you made it with nothing to spare.
- We had problems.
- We are 105 to liftoff.
Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.
- Adjustment made.
- Countdown starts at 20. Set clinometer.
- Clinometer set. Give me a printout.
- Coming your way without delay.
- That's another cat?
- Oh, yeah. A real mother.
- I gotta get to that spaceship right away.
- Who are you?
A friend of Frank Wil...
I mean General Stilton.
A very good friend.
Let's go.
Open the gate.
My car!
- Them, too.
- Never mind. Let's get down to Hopscotch.
- Sergeant.
- Captain.
Colonel.
- General.
- Oh, get in!
- Counting down.
- Hey, Frank!
Hold it, sir, right there.
General, this man says...
Hey!
You're not General Stilton.
- Frank.
- What are you doing here?
Frank, it's a nightmare.
Liz has been captured by Stallwood.
Have you been hitting the beer?
Stallwood of Supplies?
He's an agent for some guy named
Olympus, a power-crazed creep who's...
- He's holding her for ransom.
- Lucybelle, too?
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.
- Where is she?
- I'm going with you, Frank.
No, no, you don't want to get stuck here on
Earth. You're responsible to your mission.
- But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.
- Do you know where they're taking her?
- Place called Dailey's Airport.
- Do you know where it is? Let's go.
- Frank...
- Jake, you're going home.
Now, get in there.
So long, buddy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
5. 4
3. 2.
Ignite.
Bye, Jake.
Drop us a card.
OK, you clowns.
Let's move it. Let's go.
Jake!
Jake, this is insane.
You're here forever, on Earth.
You're wasting time.
The airport!
General, look!
Good heavens!
That's my car.
Get the police on the radio.
- Hello, Sequoia?
- Turn around!
Here comes a car.
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.
And the cat!
They're here. They've come.
Naturally.
You knew they would.
You knew it. We've won.
Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.
We will?
We won't?
It may be difficult to explain your part in this after the young lady's gone to the police.
Oh, dear.
You wouldn't dare?
Frank, that must be the chopper.
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.
The fools!
Get us airborne.
Watch it!
- They're getting away!
- Yeah.
But look who's arriving - the army and the police.
We have to follow that copter. What kind of an airport is this? Where are the planes?
Follow me.
Oh, you can't fly this, Jake. It's a wreck.
Look at that propeller - it's half gone.
- Are you coming or staying?
- I'm coming.
I'm staying.
OK, tovarisch.
Ponimayete po-russki?
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
- Parlez-vous fran鏰is?
- What?
- All right, Dr. Garbage Expert.
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?
Uh...
General, you're not gonna believe this.
There they are.
- It's Wilson and the cat.
- How did they get that wreck in the air?
The power that cat possesses is awesome.
You betcha, Charlie, and if you know what's good for you, you'll land...
- Quiet!
- OK.
Faster, Omar, faster.
Get close.
Use the collar to force them to land.
No chance. It's taking all I got just to keep this crate flying.
Don't panic.
We'll think of something.
What's happening?
Why aren't they doing something?
Of course!
They're afraid of harming the girl.
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.
Frank!
Jake!
Jake. Jake.
Jake! Jake.
Jake.
Turn this thing over.
Jake.
Jake.
Jake. Jake!
Jake. Jake!
Frank, are you OK?
- What are they trying to do?
- Force us down.
They probably figured out that we've got a problem.
Hold on.
Here they come.
- They're still on our tail.
- Don't panic.
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!
Whoa!
I see 'em.
I see 'em.
Look out. Jake! Jake!
- Here they come again. Jake.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fruitcake. Frank, watch out!
Jake, Jake.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Jake.
Oh, dear.
Jake.
Break off!
Buzz them again, Omar, and this time, everybody open fire.
- What happened?
- You happened, you imbecile!
- How bad is it, Omar?
- He got the controls. They're locked.
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out?
We have no choice.
Bail out?
Where are you going?
I haven't got a parachute, either.
- Then you have a problem.
- I haven't got a parachute either.
Then you have the same problem.
Wait! No, wait!
Wait a minute!
I d... I don't want to die!
Oh, swell.
Frank!
Frank!
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.
We're just waiting for them to land and we'll pass that on.
- Yes, sir.
- What'd he say?
Jake is to be treated as the representative of a friendly power, with generous borrowing credit.
In exchange for bases, of course.
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.
Holy mackerel!
Who's flying the chopper?
Frank!
Easy, Liz. Don't panic.
- What are you gonna do, Frank?
- I don't know, but I have to do something.
Hand me Lucybelle!
- Careful, Frank!
- I got her.
- Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.
- Get us up closer to the copter.
Right.
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.
Frank, you're too far away!
Closer, Jake. Closer!
Grab my hand, Liz.
Grab it!
Grab it! Liz, careful.
- OK.
- Now grab my hand. Grab my hand.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Good. That's good. That's good.
- Now grab my hand and step off.
- Step off?
- Liz!
- Huh? Ohh...
- Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.
- All right. We'll try it again.
Never mind.
We'll try something else.
- All right, put your feet on my shoulders.
- What?
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.
No!
Liz, do it!
OK. OK.
- Oh... Oh... Ohh!
- Whoa!
You see? Everything's gonna be OK,
Lucybelle. Just relax.
Jake!
Jake, what are you doing?
You know, when I saw you up in that chopper, I just... Huh?
Well, honey, looks like you're stuck with me.
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.
- Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
- What are you doing with that?
Fortunately, I never go anywhere without my Swiss Army knife.
Idiot!
All rise.
Hear ye.
The United States District Court, the
Honorable Judge Alvin Horsham presiding.
Please be seated.
You have made application for citizenship of the United States of America.
It is a signal honor, which implies not only rights, but duties and obligations - bearing arms, serving on juries, voting.
Who is sponsoring this applicant?
Oh. I am, Your Honor.
- Does the cat have a name?
- Yes, sir. Zunar J5/...
Oh!
Jake, Your Honor.
Please stand, Jake.
Repeat after me.
- I, Jake...
- I, Jake...
...pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America...
...pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America...
...and to the republic for which it stands...
...and to the republic for which it stands...
...one nation, under God, indivisible...
...one nation, under God, indivisible...
...with liberty and justice for all!
Did you hear that?
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness.
We're doomed.
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.
What's that?
R2-D2, where are you?
At last.
Where have you been?
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
What have you done with those plans?
We intercepted no transmissions.
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.
If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans!
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!
There's one.
Set for stun.
She'll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.
You'll be deactivated for sure.
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.
Come out, before somebody sees you.
Secret mission? What plans?
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.
I'm going to regret this.
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.
That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
- You've attacked a diplomatic--
- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
Take her away!
Holding her is dangerous.
If word gets out... it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
I have traced the rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
Leave that to me.
Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship... and no transmissions were made.
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
Yes, sir.
How did we get into this mess?
I really don't know how.
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.
What a desolate place this is.
Where do you think you're going?
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.
What makes you think there are settlements over there?
Don't get technical with me.
What mission?
What are you talking about?
I've just about had enough of you.
Go that way.
You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.
And don't let me catch you following me, begging for help... because you won't get it.
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.
He tricked me into going this way... but he'll do no better.
Wait. What's that?
A transport. I'm saved.
Over here!
Hey!
Hey!
Help! Please help!
R2?
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.
Look, sir. Droids.
We stopped.
Wake up. Wake up!
We're doomed.
Do you think they'll melt us down?
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Will this never end?
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!
Luke!
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.
Doesn't look like we have much choice, but I'll remind him.
Yeah, we'll take that red one.
No, not that one.
I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs--
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed--
I need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators in most respects. very similar to your vaporators in most respects.
-Can you speak Bocce?
-Of course. It's like a second language.
-All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
-Shutting up, sir.
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.
But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
Now come on.
Get to it.
All right. Come on.
And the red one.
Come on.
Come on, red. Let's go.
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.
Uncle Owen, what about that one?
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.
- Take this away.
- You'll be pleased with that one, sir.
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.
Let's go.
Don't you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move.
It just isn't fair.
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Is there anything
I might do to help?
No, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest... or teleport me off this rock.
I don't think so, sir.
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
Not on this planet, anyway.
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's a bright centre to the universe... you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.
Just Luke.
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.
Hello.
A lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you've seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through, I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are... with the rebellion and all.
You know of the rebellion against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.
There's not much to tell.
I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
Well, my little friend... you got something jammed in here real good.
Were you on a Starcruiser or--
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
What's this?
"What is what''?
He asked you a question. What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction.
Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she?
She's beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
A person of some importance,
I believe.
- Our captain was--
- Is there any more to this recording?
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.
You're my only hope.
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts... and it's a private message for him.
Frankly, I don't know what he's talking about.
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we've been through, this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan... but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
He's kind of a strange old hermit.
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.
He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the bolt... he might be able to play back the entire recording.
Oh, yeah. Well...
I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off.
Okay.
There you go.
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.
"What message''?
The one you've just been playing.
The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.
Luke! Luke!
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.
Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
No, I don't think he likes you at all.
No, I don't like you either.
- That R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?
I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?
I wonder if he's related to Ben.
That wizard's just a crazy old man.
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to
Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
He won't.
I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.
Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.
In the morning, I want them on the south ridge working on those condensers.
Yes, sir.
I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.
In fact, I was also thinking about our agreement-- about me staying on another season.
If these new droids work out, I want to apply to the academy this year.
You mean the next semester before the harvest?
Sure. There's more than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.
This year we'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands... and then you can go to the academy next year.
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.
That's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.
It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.
That's what I'm afraid of.
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.
I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.
That R2 unit has always been a problem.
These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.
- Blast it.
- Couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait till morning.
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.
-That droid's gonna cause me trouble.
-He excels at that, sir.
Come on.
Have you seen Luke this morning?
He said he had things to do before he started today, so he left early.
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.
He better have those units in the south range repaired by midday... or there'll be hell to pay.
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.
Where do you think you're going?
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
Don't talk to me of your mission.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go.
What's wrong with him now?
There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Sandpeople. Or worse.
Come on.
Let's go have a look.
Come on.
There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any--
Wait a second.
They're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.
Hello there.
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
Ben? Ben Kenobi?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly.
Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
This little droid.
He's searching for his former master... but I've never seen such devotion in a droid.
He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.
A long time.
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.
He's not dead.
Not yet.
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.
He's me.
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan... since, oh, before you were born.
Then the droid does belong to you.
I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
Very interesting.
I think we better get indoors.
The Sandpeople are easily startled... but they'll soon be back-- and in greater numbers.
3PO.
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.
Can you stand? We've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.
There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?
Quickly. They're on the move.
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.
I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy... and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...
I have something here for you.
Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough... but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan... on some damn-fool idealistic crusade, like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.
Go ahead.
- What is it?
- It's your father's lightsabre.
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon... for a more civilized age.
For over a thousand generations... the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the Empire.
How did my father die?
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader... who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil... helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
He betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
It's an energy field created by all living things.
It surrounds us and penetrates us.
It binds the galaxy together.
Let's see if we can't figure out what you are, little friend... and where you come from.
- I saw part of a message--
- I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.
But my ship
has fallen under attack...
and my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
I have placed information vital
to the survival of the rebellion...
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.
My father will know
how to retrieve it.
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've gotta get home.
I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable.
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander... not to this battle station.
The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate--
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
I've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away.
That's impossible.
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
Fear will keep the local systems in line.
- Fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?
If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station... it is possible, however unlikely... that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture... no matter what technical data they've obtained.
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
I suggest we use it.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant... next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion... has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes... or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortress--
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.
As you wish.
This bickering is pointless.
Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress... by the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke.
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
I've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
They didn't, but we are meant to think they did.
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.
These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.
And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to... and that would lead them back... home.
Wait, Luke.
It's too dangerous.
Uncle Owen.
Aunt Beru.
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location... of your hidden rebel base.
There's nothing you could have done, had you been there.
You'd have been killed too... and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
Mos Eisley spaceport.
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
We must be cautious.
How long have you had these droids?
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see his identification.
We don't need to see his identification.
These aren't the droids you're looking for.
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.
Move along.
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.
Go on, go on.
I can't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
You really think we're gonna find a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?
Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here.
Only watch your step-- this place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, R2.
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?
Your droids-- they'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you, sir.
I'll have one of those.
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead.
This little one's not worth the effort.
Come, let me get you something.
I'm all right.
Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.
I don't like the look of this.
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
I've outrun imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
She's fast enough for you, old man.
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers-- myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.
Is it some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
And it's gonna cost you something extra.
10,000, all in advance.
We could almost buy our own ship for that.
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot.
We don't have to sit here and listen--
We can pay you 2,000 now... plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen?
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.
Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
All right. We'll check it out.
17,000. Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.
I'm never coming back to this planet again.
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that
I've got his money.
It's too late.
You should have paid him when you had the chance.
Jabba's put a price on your head so large... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba--
Jabba's through with you.
He has no time for smugglers... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
That's the idea.
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
What do you mean?
I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.
Lock the door, R2.
Check this side of the street.
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.
I don't know what this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
Watch your language.
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
It'll be enough.
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!
Right here,Jabba.
I've been waitin' for you.
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
Why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor Greedo?
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come yourself. Don't send these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions.
What if everyone who smuggled for me... dropped their cargo at the first sign... of an imperial starship?
It's not good business.
Look,Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
You think I had a choice?
But I got a nice, easy charter.
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best.
So, for an extra 20% --
Fifteen,Jabba.
Don't push it.
Okay, 15% .
But if you fail me again...
I'll put a price on your head so big... you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
Come on!
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
What a piece of junk.
She'll make .5 past light speed.
She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here.
Hello, sir.
Which way?
All right, men, load your weapons.
Stop that ship.
Blast them.
Chewie, get us out of here!
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers are hotter than I thought.
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields... while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
Stay sharp. There's two more comin'.
They're gonna try and cut us off.
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought this thing was fast.
Watch your mouth, or you're gonna find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.
Here's where the fun begins.
How long before you can jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.
At the rate they're gaining?
Travelling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy.
Without precise calculations... we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova... and that would end your trip real quick.
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
We've entered the Alderaan system.
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
Charming to the last.
You don't know how hard I found it... signing the order to terminate your life.
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Princess Leia, before your execution...
I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony... that will make this battle station operational.
No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin... the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet... that'll be destroyed first.
Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base...
I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.
You would prefer another target?
A military target?
Then name the system.
I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.
Where is the rebel base?
Dantooine.
They're on Dantooine.
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.
- What?
- You're far too trusting.
Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.
But don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
Commence primary ignition.
Are you all right?
What's wrong?
I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.
You'd better get on with your exercises.
You can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs.
I told you I'd outrun them.
Don't everybody thank me at once.
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.
Now be careful, R2.
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.
I see your point, sir.
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.
But it also obeys your commands.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff... but I've never seen anything to make me believe... there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go your conscious self... and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.
Stretch out with your feelings.
You see? You can do it.
I call it luck.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
Good against remotes is one thing.
Good against the living, that's something else.
We're coming up on Alderaan.
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.
That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world.
Yes?
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
They found the remains of a rebel base... but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
She lied.
She lied to us.
I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion.
Terminate her immediately.
Stand by, Chewie.
Cut in the sublight engines.
What the--
We've come out in a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision.
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?
Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It ain't there.
It's been blown away.
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
It'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I've--
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.
It's an imperial fighter.
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.
There aren't any bases here.
Where did it come from?
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
He ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us.
He's heading for that small moon.
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.
That's no moon.
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Turn the ship around.
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Why are we still moving towards it?
A tractor beam's pulling us in.
There's gotta be something you can do.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.
They're not gonna get me without a fight.
You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.
Clear Bay 327.
We are opening
the magnetic field.
To your stations.
Come with me.
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.
Yes?
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
She may yet be of some use to us.
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.
Release charge.
316, report to control.
There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after take-off.
It must be a decoy. Several escape pods have been jettisoned.
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.
If there were any, they must have jettisoned.
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.
Yes, sir.
I sense something... a presence I've not felt since--
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.
There's no one here.
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me.
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?
The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
Let's go.
Hey, down there.
Could you give us a hand with this?
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
TK-421, do you copy?
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.
Between his howling and your blasting everything... it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight to sneakin' around.
We've found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.
He's found the controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.
They must be delivered safely... or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.
The Force will be with you... always.
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.
Anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
Who do you think--
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
He says, "I've found her,'' and keeps repeating, "She's here.''
Who? Who has he found?
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?
- Princess?
- Where is she?
Princess? What's going on?
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
Oh, no.
We've gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.
You said you didn't want to just wait to be captured. Now you want to stay?
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.
She's rich.
Rich?
Rich, powerful. If you were to rescue her, the reward would be--
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.
- You'll get it.
- I better.
You will.
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.
- All right.
- What's your plan?
3PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.
Okay, Han, you put those on.
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking... but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.
That isn't very reassuring.
517 to scanner control.
517 to scanner control.
316, report to control.
53 to upper bay door.
53 to upper bay door.
I can't see a thing in this helmet.
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?
I did say so before.
Where are you taking this... thing?
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
I wasn't notified.
I'll have to clear it.
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!
Look out.
We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Here it is-- 2187.
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.
What happened?
Had a slight weapons malfunction... but everything's perfectly all right now.
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.
Who is this?
What's your operating number?
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
Oh, the uniform.
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Where is he?
- Come on.
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.
The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
Surely he must be dead by now.
Don't underestimate the Force.
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
Yes.
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.
Get behind me.
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay? We've been cut off.
What was that?
I didn't copy.
I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out.
All other information on your level is restricted.
Open up in there.
Open up in there.
Oh, no.
There isn't any other way out.
I can't hold them off forever.
Now what?
Some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
He's the brains, sweetheart.
Well, I didn't--
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.
Get in!
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.
Get in there, and don't worry about it.
Wonderful girl.
Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her.
Get in there.
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
What an incredible smell you've discovered.
Let's get out of here.
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.
I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!
Absolutely, Your Worship.
Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here.
It's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us.
It could be worse.
It's worse.
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.
Something just moved past my leg.
Look. Did you see that?
What?
Kid! Luke!
Grab hold of this!
Blast it! My gun's jammed.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
Help him!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
It just let go of me and disappeared.
I got a bad feeling about this.
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
3PO! Come in, 3PO!
3PO!
Where could he be?
Take over. See to him.
Look, there.
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.
Follow me.
You stand guard.
Come on.
All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
All right.
3PO. Come in, 3PO.
3PO.
- Get on top.
- I can't.
Where could he be? 3PO.
3PO, will you come in.
They aren't here.
Something must have happened.
See if they've been captured. Hurry.
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?
"Use the comlink''? Oh, my.
I forgot.
I turned it off.
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!
No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no.
What?
You did great, 3PO!
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2.
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault.
My poor master.
We're all right.
You did great!
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number-- Where are we?
3263827.
If we can avoid any more female advice, we oughta be able to get out of here.
Let's get moving.
Where you goin'?
Wait! They'll hear!
Come here, you big coward.
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.
I don't know who you are or where you came from... but from now on, you do as I tell you, okay?
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight.
I take orders from just one person-- me.
It's a wonder you're still alive.
Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
No reward is worth this.
Give me regular reports, please.
Right.
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.
You seen that new VT-16?
Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it.
They say it's quite a thing to see.
What was that?
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?
Yes, sir.
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.
We're in the main hangar across from the ship.
We're right above you.
Stand by.
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.
Nice. Come on.
It's them.
Blast them.
Get back to the ship!
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on.
I think we took a wrong turn.
There's no lock.
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.
-Find the controls to extend the bridge.
-I think I just blasted it.
They're coming through.
Here, hold this.
Here they come.
For luck.
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
Where could they be?
Where could they be?
Close the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.
The circle is now complete.
When I left you,
I was but the learner.
Now I am the master.
Only a master of evil, Darth.
Your powers are weak, old man.
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...
I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
You should not have come back.
Didn't we just leave this party?
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.
I hope the old man got the tractor beam down.
Look.
Come on, R2. We're going.
Now's our chance. Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!
Run, Luke, run.
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down, or this is gonna be a short trip.
Hit it!
We're coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off. Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.
I can't believe he's gone.
There wasn't anything you could have done.
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.
Here they come.
They're coming in too fast!
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.
Got him. I got him!
Great, kid.
Don't get cocky.
There's still two more.
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.
Are they away?
They've just made the jump into hyperspace.
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.
That doesn't sound too hard.
They let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information in R2 is still intact.
What's so important?
What's he carrying?
The technical readouts of that battle station.
I only hope that when the data's analysed a weakness can be found.
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.
I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.
You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.
I care.
So... what do you think of her, Han?
I'm trying not to, kid.
Good.
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me--
No.
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.
You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.
It's our only hope.
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.
We are preparing
to orbit the planet.
The battle station is heavily shielded... and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet.
Its defences are designed around a direct large-scale assault.
A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defence.
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters against that?
The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat... or they'd have a tighter defence.
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia... has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
The approach will not be easy.
You're required to manoeuvre straight down this trench... and skim the surface to this point.
The target area is only two metres wide.
It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
A precise hit will start a chain reaction... which should destroy the station.
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
That's impossible, even for a computer.
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.
They're not much bigger than two metres.
Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.
Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi... and will soon see the end of the rebellion.
All flight crews,
man your stations.
So, you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
That's right. Yeah.
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?
Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?
You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
It's more like... suicide.
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.
I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Hey, Luke.
May the Force be with you.
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.
All pilots to your stations.
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.
I only wish Ben were here.
Open main launch tubes.
Main launch tubes opening, sir.
Hey, Luke!
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.
Are you sure you can handle this ship?
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories.
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.
This R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up. You want a new one?
Not on your life. That droid and I have been through a lot.
You okay, R2?
Good.
Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
Luke, the Force will be with you.
Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.
Red Five standing by.
Lock S-foils in attack position.
We're passing through
the magnetic field.
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.
Look at the size of that thing.
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.
We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and draw their fire.
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.
Luke, pull up!
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so small they're evading our turbolasers.
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.
I'm on it.
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.
I've got a problem here.
- Eject.
- I can hold it.
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right--
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.
Luke, trust your feelings.
Squad leaders... we've picked up a new group of signals.
Enemy fighters coming your way.
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.
You've got one on your tail.
I'm hit!
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him.
I'll be right there.
Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me.
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.
Fighters above you, coming in.
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.
Hang on back there.
Red Six, can you see Red Five?
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?
I can't shake him.
I'm on him, Luke.
Blast it, Biggs.
Where are you?
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.
Stay in attack formation.
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.
Switch all power to front deflector screen.
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.
Switch to targeting computer.
Computer's locked.
Getting a signal.
The guns. They've stopped.
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.
They're coming in.
Three marks at 210.
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.
Yes, sir.
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.
Loosen up!
Gold Five to Red Leader, lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.
We've analysed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.
Should I have your ship standing by?
Evacuate?
In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.
Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.
Red Leader, this is Base One.
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.
Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.
This is it.
We should be able to see it by now.
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?
- No sign of any-- Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.
I'm in range.
Target's coming up.
Just hold them off for a few seconds.
Close up formation.
Almost there.
-Let her loose. They're right behind me.
-Almost there.
I can't hold them.
It's away!
- It's a hit!
- Negative.
Negative. It didn't go in.
It just impacted on the surface.
Red Leader, we're right above you.
Turn to .05.
We'll cover for you.
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.
Get set up for your attack run.
Rebel base, one minute and closing.
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.
Right with you, boss.
Luke, at that speed, will you be able to pull out in time?
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.
Are you sure the computer can hit it?
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.
What about that tower?
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again. See if you can't lock it down.
Fighters coming in .3.
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.
R2, try and increase the power.
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.
Quick.
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.
I'm on the leader.
Hang on, R2.
Use the Force, Luke.
Let go, Luke.
The Force is strong with this one.
Luke, trust me.
His computer's off.
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm all right.
I've lost R2.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
Rebel base in range.
You may fire when ready.
Commence primary ignition.
I have you now.
What?
Look out.
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.
Stand by.
Stand by.
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.
I just knew you'd come back.
I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
I knew there was more to you than money.
Oh, no.
Oh, my.
R2, can you hear me?
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
He'll be all right.
Essex!
Look!
What is it?
My God.
It's flying north!
I haven't seen one of those in years.
I didn't know there were any left.
Will we make it to the city?
If the dogs are out this far, there may be no city left
You're funny
What?
You've always told me you left the city because there was nothing for you there and now you are returning
Don't you think that's funny?
No
Tell me about your city
I already have
Again
There were 25 levels five sectors
In the center there was a park with a lake
And I remember the trees
Vivia?
Six
Seventeen.
- Limbo
- Shh-shh-shh
Blockade
Redstone you're in the tournament
Argo gratias.
You share the threat
You're up.
Me?
Good
Deuca
So soon?
My pleasure, sir
- Oh?
- Quintet!
Not your day, Ernecht
Better luck next time
- Your luck is better, Ambrosia
- Finally
A bonus
A new game is starting at table number six.
Vivia
Vivia!
- May have been a bad idea coming here
- It's a place to go
That's what you said
Essex
By knowing five numbers, you can find any person here?
Five numbers and a color code, yes
How many people lived here?
Five million.
Five million?
Yes. It was designed for a million people in each sector.
And you could find a person with only five numbers?
And a color code, yes
You know so much
But not how to find seals
Vivia!
Vivia?
Vivia?
Vivia!
Vivia?
You're not very good at finding people
Don't run off like that
- I was just playing
- I know
But don't run off that way
Shouldn't we help him?
He's gonna freeze to death
He already has
I'm so tired of walking.
It's not far.
And what if he's not there?
You don't even know if he's alive
We'll face that when we get to it
I'm hungry
Who is there?
My name is Essex
I'm looking for my brother
Name is Francha.
Does he still live here?
There is no one here by this name.
Could you tell me where he went?
What did you say your name was?
Essex.
Essex.
My God
Come
Come in
We have a fire
Come, come, come
Quick
Essex
I was sure you were dead
Are trains running anywhere?
Where have you been?
South, hunting.
I went 10, 12 years ago.
I lost count.
- I didn't know if you'd be here
- South, huh?
- What's to the south?
- Seals
Well, not anymore
How'd you find me?
Things have changed so.
- Information center
- That still works? No
It doesn't transmit
The information's still there
Oh, that's Vivia
I used to hunt with her father.
He's dead now.
Jaspera Aeon
Obelus
My brother
What's your name, child?
Vivia
We're hungry
Is there any food?
Of course
Jaspera, some food
Is the whole city like this?
Will I find work here?
I can't believe my eyes
So young
Nothing like her anymore.
She's the youngest person I've seen.
She could be the last one born, for all we know, the- the end of the line
This is a real event.
My God.
Jaspera Aeon
It's true.
It's alive
Feel it
How long, child?
Five months, at least
This calls for a celebration.
- We are a real family now
- Yes
Some booza
Set the table
Quintet, huh?
You play, of course
When my family was alive
But I wasn't very good
Well, never mind
There are six of us We'll play
The last seal we killed was just after Vivia's father died
I never saw an animal fight so hard to stay alive
Well, I've even forgotten what seal meat tastes like
That must have been-
Well, it was more than a year ago
I'm so glad you came when you did
Francha was just leaving for another tournament
The hell with the tournament
They can play without me for a while
They still have tournaments here?
Oh, yes
On all levels
What about work?
How do you stay alive?
We play!
There's nothing left but the game.
- Have you got pieces, Vivia?
- These will do
Oh, yes.
Sit. Sit, child.
Ah, some booza
This'll warm you
Here
That girl's a miracle
There's been no new life here and no hope for any
Oh, not in limbo, child
You're up in the killing circle
- Have you got pieces?
- I haven't played for years
Well, here
You can use these
From my collection
You collect Quintet pieces?
Oh, yes It's a hobby
Hobby?
What does that mean?
That's just something to do... for no reason
Come on, Essex
Let's play
I don't think I could put my mind to it.
All right We'll make you sixth man
You can play the survivor
Somebody'll have to go to the market for some more wood if we're to stay up.
I'll do it.
I wanna look around
There has to be work somewhere
There's a wood seller in the market below
Here
A thousand old sou a kilo
Don't let him cheat you
Make sure it's not treated
- Where'd you get-
- I've been very lucky in the casino
Essex?
I'm sure I'll be the first one to lose
Francha will look after you
- Be careful
- Yes!
We must be careful with a man who hunts seals where there are no seals
We'll roll on
Five, four
- Double limbo
- Double limbo
Ah Limbo five
One there, one there
Four, two I'll arrange the killing order for Essex
You see
I'm after you
- Can't be that important
- Hmm
Oh-ho!
You're after your own death!
Hello!
I need wood.
Buy or trade?
Buy
Enough for the night
- Two bundles.
- Is it treated?
Never been any complaints
- Treated with what?
- From a building.
This wood doesn't come from buildings
Taken out of the ice
Here you are
- I'm going to get you.
- No, you won't
Ohh!
At last the end is coming.
Where are you from?
- The south.
- The south?
They say there are still seals in the south. Is it true?
If there were, I'd still be there
Why do you torment me?
I broke no rules!
What?
Are you finding all the information you want?
The system is all but ruined
Trying to find a person or a place?
A friend
Oh A friend
How interesting
Amicus.
I haven't heard that word for a long time
And what do you use in its place?
Alliance
How did you and your friend become separated?
Time
Where does your friend live?
He doesn't
Redstone?
I'm a friend
- "Friend"?
- Yes. I know him.
I'm supposed to meet him here
Is he expected soon?
The tournament won't be over for many days or more.
They play at the old casino
He has a room... at the Hotel Electra.
Where's that?
Second sector
Red level
- Your-Your hand-
- Please don't
I haven't had a fire for-
When did you last see Redstone?
Yesterday
If you see him again-
What?
Yesterday
You won't
They still let rooms here?
Uh, Deuca
She's probably in the Quintet room
I really played the casinos.
Six and two
Is there a Deuca here?
- I'm Deuca
- Redstone
- Redstone?
- Yes.
He hasn't checked in yet
Well, something happened
I was delayed
You're lucky I still have a room
- May I have a key?
- There are no keys here
You're room 243
All right
- Four and six.
- Four and six.
This is one of the imponderables
You play, sir
"Redstone, Francha
'Deusha'- "
Deuca?
"Goldstar
St Christopher, Ambrosia"
Oh. I'm sorry.
I must have the wrong room
I was looking for a friend
I'm the only one here
This is my room
My name is Grigor
Perhaps the room I wanted is the next one over
But this is a nice room
Pardon me
- What's your name?
- Redstone
Redstone You're lucky to have a warm room, Redstone
Why don't you put that knife away?
I will tell you the truth
Redstone
What? That it was no mistake you came here?
I am afraid I have been playing the sixth man with you
I thought the room would be empty
I wanted to shave
There's no water
There is nothing but water and soon that's all that will be left
The planet will be frozen in an envelope of ice and that will mercifully be the end of this history
May I sit down?
- You don't stay here at the hotel?
- My room's at the casino.
I'm the adjudicator there, the referee
The judge, you might say
A judge?
I interpret the rules
I settle the disputes
It's a lonely thing to do
The worst thing is not playing- watching, game after game and not being allowed to play
That's why I come here on my days off.
There are very good players in this hotel
Some great ones, I tell you
Do you organize these tournaments?
Ah, you know about the tournaments.
I knew- I knew that you were a player
I saw that fire in your eyes
Only tournament players have that sense of life
I knew that you were in this room,
Redstone
See, I misrepresent without even knowing it
It is one of the problems of my work
One begins to lie even to friends
Forgive me, Redstone
I was looking for company
There is no camaraderie anymore.
No talk
No exchange of ideas or tactics
I meant no harm, my friend
Where do the explosives come from?
Explosives? Oh.
Alcohol
As long as the moss grows, they will make alcohol
And as long as there is alcohol, they will make explosives.
It's a waste
Come join me in a game and some alcohol
Deuca has booza
I know
- Deuca
- Yes.
Deuca.
Deuca-
She's very efficient, but nervous
Watch
She's always expecting the worst
But she's not to be underestimated
What took you so long?
We had to stop the game.
I was with my friend.
Yes, I know
Redstone
- Are we playing?
- Without question
But first, some drinks
I promised my friend some booza
- It's in the game room
- Good
Ambrosia
- You're sitting there alone.
- So I am
We are about to play.
You'll join us.
Deuca's bringing drinks
Booza
Ah He's my friend
Redstone
He's a new player
He doesn't look new
- Are you dangerous?
- No.
I don't like to play games.
I'm not dangerous.
That's good
I'm not dangerous either
My name is Ambrosia
It's a silly name
I think I should change it
Change
Everyone wants to change everything
There is nothing to change
Do you like your name...
Redstone?
Why not? It serves its purpose.
And mine doesn't.
You can sit here, Redstone
Drink carefully
This is the end of the bottle
Where's Grigor?
Maybe he found a better game
Let me have his share
What handsome pieces
Your own handiwork, Redstone?
- I inherited them
- Ah
- You have family?
- I had a brother here, but he's dead
So let's roll for the sixth man
Let the new player have the honor
Deuca seems to know that you're not dangerous
What are the stakes?
Sometimes we just play for the thrill of it
Weak roll, Redstone
You'll never make sixth man like that
- Quintet
- Automatic
I always play the sixth man
One, five
Five and four.
Six and two.
Four, five.
Six and three
So, I'll arrange the killing order
I want Deuca to kill you and I want you two to change place
Grigor?
Grigor, I have to talk to you
Listen to me
I need a ruling
This is frustrating
Never happened before
You knew Redstone as well as I did
Now we have this impostor to deal with
Does he know what he's doing?
You ask me so many questions
- Which one should I answer first?
- Damn it, Grigor
Redstone never should have been allowed in to start with
He was a fool He jumped the starting time by an hour
How do you know that?
Well, I- I was following him
Then so did you, St Christopher!
I didn't kill him until after the designated time
I was within the rules
Anyway, Redstone was a butcher!
He killed a whole roomful when he took Francha
Well, that's not an infraction
A sensitive player doesn't do that
Sensitive?
Did I hear you, of all people, use that word?
I play to win, but there are certain ethics to be considered
At this moment, if I were you,
I would be more concerned about Goldstar
- He has no ethics at all
- Nor brains
I do not consider him a threat
I find you insulting
He could get lucky
It's happened before
You're late, Grigor
Late for what?
Give me the booza
What about this new Redstone?
Drink
How do I deal with him?
Before I can decide that
I must learn how much he knows
Not how much he knows but who he is
Where is he?
- Who is "he"?
- You know who I mean Christopher
- Saint?
- St Christopher
He was standing there a second ago
Now he's gone
So he is
Which exit did he leave by?
I don't know that he left
I only know that, uh, he isn't here
Damn you, Grigor
You're trying to help him
You're always against me
You have no regard for me
I'm not here to help or regard
I am here to interpret rules
If it's help you need,
I suggest you talk to the sixth man
I find you despicable
I despise your arrogance!
It is as planned
There is an open seat at table number one
Grigor
St Christopher
Playing God
Move!
Out of my way, you fool!
Come on
Come on You cannot leave us
There's a better way to die
Come on
All you need is a five, and you have him
Then it's between you and Deuca
- A three and a two
- Good!
Now it's the two of you
She's been giving you good advice
It's obvious it's you she wants to face and not me
Are you so certain?
You're so predictable
I sometimes lose interest
That's not good
Run away from her, Redstone
Let her make the mistake
I get impatient I can't stand waiting around I said I didn't like games
Why do you play?
Education
- Four and a one
- Good! You got her
- Dead
- He's all yours, Ambrosia
So come, everybody
Put up the dead man
You only made one tactical error.
You killed her in your own sector
No one can protect you now
All I need is a one, and I win
One is my lucky number
Double one.
That's what I call overkill.
I got killed with one throw
That's very impressive
Being sixth man is an advantage
It's also boring
I just start to get excited, and it's all over
- Do you live near here?
- Yes
In this sector?
In this hotel
Room next to yours
How do you know what room I'm in?
Deuca told me
Deuca
Tell me about Deuca
I know her
You know a lot
And you are very curious
Do you know a man named Francha?
- Is he a Quintet player?
- Yes
I know a man named Francha
He lives in another sector
He comes to the casino quite often
- He's a very good player
- He was
Are you telling me he's dead?
No, I'm telling you he was killed
Good night, Redstone
Don't forget to bolt your door
Who is it?
- Who's in my room?
- It's all right. It's Goldstar.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
It's cold.
Do you have a blanket?
Nothing?
Nothing for me?
Nothing tonight.
I don't feel like drinking.
That was a very-
Now you're misreading my expression.
Everybody knows there are no locks in the hotel.
No locks, but tight security.
Obviously not as tight as you thought.
I waited half an hour before I could slip by without Deuca seeing me
I couldn't chance that
I hope you have as much luck leaving
Now, you say that, but you don't mean it
You're like all the rest
St Christopher- he's the worst
- He humiliated me tonight
- Is that possible?
He came to the casino with Grigor.
I was playing there
He came right in the same room with me
Of course, Grigor was there to protect him, which, of course, he's not supposed to do
Get off my bed and tell me what you're doing here so late
St Christopher
I'm going to enjoy killing him
Saint, indeed!
He thinks he can charm Grigor
Well, Grigor can't protect him for long
- Why are you coming to me?
- To ask you outright
Is there a plot against me?
If there is, you would know, and I protest it
It is not legal
I asked you to get off my bed
I don't trust Grigor
And I know St Christopher
Now, tell me
I know it's true
There's no plot that I know of, Goldstar.
And if there is,
I have nothing to do with it.
Don't be too sure
Don't you be too sure
Your day will come and before long we may be facing one another again under different circumstances
I've wasted my time coming here
Well, you may put the word out that I know what's going on
You may tell St Christopher that I'm after him
And don't be too sure you won't be far behind
Who is it?
- It's Redstone
- I'm not open yet.
- Well, can you let me in anyway?
- No.
Hello!
I'm looking for someone who lives at the hotel
- Who?
- St Christopher
He doesn't live in the hotel
He doesn't?
You know him then?
He runs a charity house in the fourth sector
Thank you
Help me
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
Solace!
The geometric shape of the universe reflects the scheme of life
You've been taught that they are the same
You've been taught that the universe is bounded by five sides and that life has but five stages
Primum- the pain of birth
Secundum- the labor of maturing
Tercium- the guilt of living
Quartum- the terror of aging
Quintum- the finality of death
But this is not complete for five sides demand a sixth space a center and that is what you have to look forward to
What is the sixth space?
It's empty
It's blackness
Void!
In other ages equally ignorant it was said an eternal fire would follow death
But I tell you-
I tell you... there is no fire
I tell you, fire is not enough punishment
No
No, my sons!
The emptiness I'm speaking of is the total horror of madness the awareness of nothing
So, your wretched lives, in fact are supremely happy
It is your reward
You must cherish your tortured life because it is a pause, an interruption of the void preceding and following it
Don't fight.
Don't struggle.
Accept
When you think of the number five remember it is six
And if you look for an answer, look far beyond what facts you have... and add yet one more- the unknown
Because only when you consider the unknown you have a hope, a chance to solve the dilemma
Redstone!
You're far away from the hotel
Well, so are you
I used to live in this sector
I sometimes come here to remember
Is that helpful- to remember?
- Sometimes one can't avoid it
- Who's St Christopher?
I'm sorry
Did you hear me?
- I don't know him
- Oh, really?
I said I don't know him
I know who he is
I know he plays Quintet at the casino
Oh, this is nice
You know, there are people who say he's the best player alive
The man in your room last night said he was gonna kill St Christopher
- Are you spying on me?
- No, you woke me up
He said he was gonna kill St Christopher
That man is a very bad sport
Quite paranoid but harmless
Poor Goldstar is a bad loser
He has a passion for the game, but he'll never be anything but a mediocre player
The only way he can save face is to accuse someone like St Christopher of cheating
Very cowardly.
He seemed very convincing
Tell me-
Do I misunderstand the word "killing"?
Not if you understand Quintet
Do you want to come in?
I keep a bottle
All right
Please sit down
That's the man who was in your room last night
I can never get used to this mindless killing
Mindless? It's ritual.
It's a ritual killing
And they wanted you to see it.
Or me
There's a list
His name was on it-
"Goldstar"
My brother's name was on the list.
They bombed his apartment.
But there were others killed
One of them was just a girl who-
I saw the man who bombed it, and I chased him
When I caught up with him, somebody had slit his throat
There is a list, and anyone on it is marked, like he is
You must be wrong- trying to find a meaning where there is none
Death is arbitrary
At least, that has always been the main complaint
Your name is on the list too
Let's not think about it
Maybe it's better this way
To try to prolong life is pointless
In a few years, maybe months all dying will be done
I don't want to be alone
I can't!
W- Would you sleep here in my bed with me?
Mmm
Things have gotten so bad
It didn't used to be like this
I never think of the past
It's gone, but-
Maybe it's the closeness of another person
You make me think of life
You remind me of what we have lost
Something wrong?
It's not common to see people smile
I had a dream
I- I dreamed about my mother
We were together on a train
I was ahead of her and I- I turned around and I saw her walk up the aisle
She was younger than I am now
Very pretty
She wore a green hat
We didn't speak
We just smiled at each other
It was not at all sad
It was immensely pleasurable
When I woke up,
I had a smile on my face
I put up my hand, and I could- I could feel it
Do you dream about the past very often?
I never thought of it- whether I dream of it often or not
Memory is unreliable
I can't relate to my past
So much has changed
I would like to see my past clearly but I- I can't trust my memory
I think memory is the only thing you can trust
Do you still have hope?
Like a child
- Just a minute
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for St Christopher
- Come in
What do you want?
- Does this list belong to you?
- Yes
- Where did you get it?
- I found it
Then it doesn't belong to you
Did you steal it?
I have it That's enough
Your name is here
- It is of no interest to me
- It should be
- Goldstar
- Yes I know the name
Dead Murdered Francha
- I know the names
- Dead Murdered
Are there other lists?
Has it occurred to you that what you're doing is disruptive?
You'll never understand the scheme until you're part of the scheme
Are you telling me I will be?
Yes
At the exact moment where it will be too late
Redstone?
What a surprise to see you here
You lead a very active life, hmm?
Tell me, is St Christopher as good a player as they say he is?
- He is good, but too serious
- And not very talkative
Talk? Oh, if it is talk you want, come with me, Redstone
I know a place
We can have drinks and talk about life
Only thing I've seen is death or the prospect of it
But that's what makes life worthwhile
Every time you cheat death you feel the pure thrill of life
And that is what my job is
That is why I'm so content in this frozen world
Tell me, exactly what is your job?
To keep the game alive
The game is all that's important
The only intelligent expression left is the game of Quintet
All the elements of life are contained in it
Our art, our philosophy
All things of value fit the game
The game is the only thing of value
Come, come
Do I disturb you?
As a matter of fact, you do
The door wasn't bolted
It's collection time
I've come for the money
And you're very prompt
Did you think I wouldn't pay?
Redstone didn't
I was just in his room
He's gone, and I don't expect him back
He didn't sleep in his bed last night
He slept here with me
That's not possible
You have such a perverse sense of humor.
So do you
You weren't exactly discreet in presenting your victory over Goldstar.
That's so lovely
You must be proud to have such a treasure
Promise me you'll leave it to me
Isn't that very presumptuous... with St Christopher still present?
You're a dreamer, Deuca.
He's no Goldstar.
- St Christopher doesn't frighten me
- He should.
And Redstone will be back
I'll get another bottle, Redstone
Booza
Redstone
- Scheme Order
- Scheme?
What is the scheme?
Disrupting the order
Excuse me
I don't understand
To understand the scheme you have to be part of it
- Part of it?
- Uh-huh
- You're not making any sense
- You're part of it See, the list
Is the list part of the scheme?
- Are you all right?
- Do other people have the list?
But I don't understand you
What are you talking about?
No Think of five
Hmm?
- Yes
- It's six
Are you all right?
Consider the unknown
- The goose
- The goose?
The goose
Does he know where he's going or does he just fly into the unknown?
With all due respect, Redstone,
I don't understand what you're talking about
Oh, maybe you had too much booza
What a coincidence and what a surprise.
Look.
A surprise, but not a coincidence
Nah, maybe it's the other way around.
He is here to help people, see.
His work brings him here.
Does your work bring you here? Hmm?
You're drunk, Redstone.
I brought you here
Don't you remember?
Yeah, I-
Yeah-
St Christopher
Redstone is drunk
He is in need.
You must help him home.
I must help him home?
You can't be serious
Are you not St Christopher, protector of the needy?
He's helpless
He needs protection
He certainly looks helpless, but he's not Redstone.
Don't anticipate my ruling
Remember, he lives in the hotel
Room number-
I know what room he lives in
Oh, don't be so serious,
St Christopher
Does not Deuca live in the Hotel Electra also?
Come up
Come Let's go
Deuca!
Deuca!
Be seated, please
You may begin
I am the winner of the front game... and I'm prepared to meet the sixth man.
Are you prepared?
I am prepared
But the front game is not played out yet
Redstone is still alive
Redstone is dead
I killed him
Where's the proof?
An impostor is carrying his markers.
Are you suggesting
I kill him as well?
If you are to meet me
It would be a digression
How do we know he won't kill you?
He won't Killing the impostor is a mere formality
I think you're afraid to face me
I'm afraid of nothing here
The unknown at least holds hope
Hope?
Hope is an obsolete word
I demand a judgment
The impostor
Even though he has not chosen to play the game he is in it
It is like life
None of us are in it by choice
The man who carries Redstone's markers is Redstone.
His life is not important outside the game
So be it
You look so sad, Ambrosia
On the contrary, Grigor
I am supremely content
I know how the game will end.
How?
You'll see
Redstone! Wait!
Wait!
- Where are you going?
- To my brother's house
- What for?
- To look for something.
There's something
I have to understand
Understand?
Is that important now?
St. Christopher will kill you if he sees you.
If he'd wanted to try to kill me, he would've done it last night
He had the perfect chance
Last night is not today
Redstone!
My name is Essex
That was yesterday
Today you are Redstone
Are you prepared?
Death doesn't wait
We already had four
Remember?
You're number five!
Primum! Remember?
It was Francha! Butchered!
Secundum- death of a coward!
Tercium- the stupid one!
Ah, quartum, that was Deuca!
Oh, Deuca was an artistic death
But yours?
What game are you going to play... you hunter of seals, huh?
Have you found what you're looking for?
Yes, I have
Did you meet St Christopher?
He's dead
And now do you understand?
You mean, the game?
Can I see what you have found?
Grigor!
You shouldn't have brought her here
Take that body out of here
It's proof
I won
What's the prize?
Prize?
Winning?
Being alive- that is the only prize
You play for the thrill of it.
It is life itself.
It is feeling the heat of the adrenaline rushing through your body
Life can only be felt when death is near.
That is what the game of Quintet is- those who play fight for their lives
And that is what you have learned
Is it not?
Tell me about that- the heat of adrenaline rushing through your body
That should do it for you.
The smell of death- that's about as close as you ever get to it
Someone has to be the adjudicator
Someone has to be the judge
It is my humble job
"Humble"?
I'm not sure you're even human
Why are you going?
There is nowhere else to go.
There is nothing more to be gained.
There is nothing more to be learned
So searching is pointless.
It is like spending the game in limbo... throwing an infinite combination of sixes
You could be the greatest player of all
New tournaments are starting right now!
Pity
Where are you going?
- North
- North?
There is nothing there.
You won't last a day and a half
You'll freeze to death
You may know that
I don't
