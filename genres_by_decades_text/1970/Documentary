There was to ¿no reason that something like this dream.

One of the last bastions of nature
On the ground.
However, even in this paradise unblemished
In death becomes a way of survival.
During the observation of many creatures
With local d¿ungli zda³em realized
That nature wyposa¿y³a
Each time one creature
The assistance necessary for survival.
There is no shelter for vulnerabilities.
The right to territory must be respected.
One Wrong move can easily skoñczyæ to death.
When an animal becomes aim
It is only in death kwesti¹ seconds
¿And none opportunity is not wasted.
There is a natural balance that
Must zostaæ preserved in d¿ungli.
In death of one of the creatures it is to prolong
¿YCI else.

This is the commencement of the feast.

In contrast to the Maasai who œwiêtuj¹

It is just one of the many denials of modernity.

Nothing more and nothing less.
Do animals czuj¹ that zostan¹ killed?
The study data show that not.
But when the machine starts pracowaæ
A zaczn¹ pistons to rotate
Odg³os za¿ynanych livestock is audible

"A Mosfilm Production"
SERGUEl EISENSTEIN
EDWARD TISSE
GRIGORY ALEXANDROV
QUE VIVA MEXICO!
Mexico, 1931
Sergei Eisenstein, the film director.
His assitants:
Edward Tisse, cameraman... and me, Grigory Alexandrov, director.
How did we land in this amazing country?
Sergei Eisenstein's films of the 20's... especially "The Battleship Potemkin," won him renown.
He, and we along with him... were invited to Hollywood to make a film.
But Eisenstein didn't see eye to eye... with the Hollywood tycoons.
Helped by Upton Sinclair, the American writer... we decided to shoot a film about Mexico.
But first there was much we had to learn... about that country.
The great Mexican painters,
Diego Rivera...
David Siqueiros... and Jose Orozco... were our guides and teachers.
We spent two months filming.
We travelled north to south, east to west... driving thousands of miles along rugged roads.
A feature of this land... struck us as amazing.
A hundred miles meant the difference between epochs... separating the pre-Columbian
Mexico... from that of the time of the Spanish conquest... the Mexico of the feudal rule... from modern Mexico.
Eisenstein felt that this unusual country... deserved an unusual film and that Mexico's tragic story... could be told without actors or sets.
A script was written... and we began making
Que Viva Mexico!
Our filming crew... consisted of only us three.
But we were young.
We were ready to move mountains.
Even so, we did not manage to complete shooting or editing the film.
All our reels of film were held up in Hollywood, where they had been developed and printed.
Later they landed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
They were turned over to us only a short time ago... after nearly half a century of negociations.
Eisenstein and Tisse are no longer with us... but what they did belongs to the living.
You will see the film... as Eisenstein conceived it... and as we planned it.
We do not know what the great director... would have done with the picture today.
But using his script and drawings, we have tried... to get as close as possible to what he had in mind.
The film was to consist of several parts... some close to being documentary and some acted.
On the whole, it was intended to be... a colourful film symphony of Mexico.
QUE VIVA MEXICO!
"Prologue"
The time in the prologue... is eternity.
It could all be taking place today... or have happened 20 years ago... or even a thousand years ago.
"The text is by Eisenstein.
It is read by S. Bondarchuk."
Stone.
Gods.
People.
A land of sacred ruins and huge pyramids.
Men and women with the features of their ancestors.
The pagan temples of holy cities.
A kingdom of death... where the past dominates the present.
And faces like those hewn in stone- like those... of the Mexicans of old.
Symbolic reminder of the past:
A funeral amidst dead ruins.
In total bondage... to the idea of death, of man's physical end.
Tropical Tehuantepec.
Here time flows slowly... to the accomplishment of the rustle of the palm fronds.
The way of life remains unchanged for centuries.
At its dawn, the world must have been full... of the same regal indolence.
"The Sandunga"
Girls sing the sandunga as they daydream of the future.
Full of pride in her youthful beauty.
Concepcion.
Her most cherished dream - a gold necklace.
A dream shared by every girl in Tehuantepec.
The necklace is her dowry, her key to marital bliss.
The woman works, she chooses a husband for herself... and she brings him into their new house.
Matriarchate.
Rule by the women.
Here the girls go to work early and save every copper... to acquire a necklace of gold coins... by the time they are 16 or 18.
Concepcion needs one more gold coin - just one - for her dream to be realized.
May your necklace bring you happiness!
Abundio, the object of Concepcion's affection.
Isn't this what you wanted,
Concepcion?
What you dreamed of for so long?
The matter passes into the hands... of the mothers and matchmakers.
They inspect the dowry.
How many coins in the necklace?
Are they pure gold?
The whole population of Tehuantepec... takes part in the event.
A slow, semi-vegetative existence.
A way of life... that has not changed over the centuries.
As the years go by, new flowers blossom.
"Fiesta"
The action of this story is set... during the Feast of the Holy Virgin of Guadalupe.
But this is also an annual reminder... of Spain's conversion of Mexico... into a colony of bloodshed and suffering.
In the 16th century.
Cortes conquered Mexico
The monks who came with him wiped out pagan cults... with fire and sword.
On pyramids once crowned by Aztec and Toltec temples... the Spaniards erected
Catholic churches... so as not to change the routes of the pilgrims... who had been coming there for thousands of years.
A mystery play, in which the pilgrims who enact it... portray the sufferings of Jesus.
Sharp prickles penetrate the bodies... of those who make crosses out of cactus stems... and, with these tied on their shoulders... crawl for hours to the top of the pyramid.
Masks of devils, pagan gods... and Spanish conquistadors side by side.
The dance goes on from dawn to dusk.
Without a pause.
Over and over again... they repeat the same steps... in honor of the Holy Virgin.
Or perhaps - who knows - of a more ancient goddess - the awesome mother of gods
Then the gory finale, the bullfight.
Introduced by the Spaniards... and now a national spectacle of the Mexicans.
David Liseaga, a famous Mexican matador.
His younger brother.
Baronito, a picador.
They call on their mother... to say good-bye to her... perhaps for the last time.
Today is a day when the toreros will kill bulls... in honor of the Virgin.
The chosen queens of the bullfight.
The razor's edge... between death and victory.
Among the local belles...
Baronito catches sight of his lady love...
Se? Ora Calderon.
What else is there for the poor picador to do?
Mexico, tender and lyrical.
And also cruel.
Above the high hacienda walls... floats a plaintive song.
The peons beg the Holy Virgin to ease their sufferings... on the day now dawning.
The time: The beginning of the 20th century... during the reign of dictator Porfirio Diaz.
"Maguey"
Native to the hilly country of the state of Hidalgo... is a large cactus named maguey.
These lands... are a part of the Tetlapayac hacienda... in Llanos de Apam.
Their lot, day after day, is to suck out... the thick juice from the heart of the cactus.
The juice will ferment and be ready to drink.
The strong, milky white beverage is called pulque.
Sebastian, a peon, is at work in the fields.
His betrothed, Maria, is brought by her parents.
Felicio, Sebastian's younger brother.
The landlords and his friends.
Every bride-to-be on the estate must be shown to the master.
The old man's daughter Sara... arrives with her cousin.
A family holiday.
The landlord celebrates.
Maria is forgotten.
The naive girl is unaware of what is in store for her.
Fate takes the form of a drunken guest.
Hatred sparks a plot.
Three of his comrades and Felicio, his brother-
They will help him to take revenge.
They want to free Maria.
Slumbering Mexico. Enslaved Mexico
Fermenting Mexico
And finally, fighting revolutionary Mexico
But that last part remained undone
The picture's small budget was used up... and shooting came to an end.
We returned home.
"Soldadera" was intended to depict Mexico... during the uprising of 1910 a country engulfed in the flames of civil war... divided into hostile camps... and then united by the victory of the revolution.
The Mexican people at arms... were to be the heroes of this story.
Soldaderas are the wives of soldiers.
They broke into villages and captured provisions... to feed their weary men.
The soldaderas were always beside the men.
The soldadera to us was to have been... a symbol of Mexico itself - a symbol of land whose people came to realize... that strength lies in unity... and that they must unite to fight reaction.
"Epilogue"
The time. 1931
The place. Mexico.
Another holiday, the Day of the Dead.
On this day, November 2... the emblem of death and, above all, skulls... are everywhere.
The day begins with mourning for the dead.
Revelry in cemeteries, eating on gravestones...
Iovemaking in the cemetery shrubbery.
From candles and food in the graveyard... to a rollicking carnival.
The Mexican scorns death.
What is more... the Mexican mocks death.
Chocolate coffins complete with sugar corpse.
And at the day's end, all this goes... into the bronzed bellies of Mexican children.
A skull under a minister's top hat... a fireman's helmet, a policeman's cap... a general's cocked hat.
Not a cult of death this, not the stillness of stone... or the awesomeness of stone idols...
No!
But man's triumph over death through mockery of it.
The masks are removed.
Not sham skulls now but real ones.
The corpses of a doom class.
Whom will we see behind this mask?
A soldadera's son?
One of whose hands are destined to forge... a truly free Mexico?

Interesting. - It is interesting.

Do you like the lines around the lips?
No, I don't like and she knows that.
But I like the idea of the blue lines with the pink lipstick. That's quite good.
- You see how they pick on me and make me feel terrible?
- You're a girl. What do you know about make-up?
Exactly! That's what I say all the time(!)

In 1963 World in Action made a film about these seven year old children they talked about their homes, their schools and what they wanted to be they were filmed again when they were fourteen we've brought them all together to watch the films because this year they are twenty-one what are they doing now?
How have they changed?
What sort of people are they?
Stop it at once!
Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man
When I leave the school I'm going to..
Colet Court and then I will be going to
Rossminster Boarding School if I pass the exam and then we think I'm going to
Cambridge and Trinity Hall
Well... before I'm old and that, enough to get a job
I'll just walk around and see what I can find
I want to be a jockey when I grow up yeah
When I leave school
I'm going to The
Dragon School, I might and after I might go to
Charterhouse Marlborough
What about university Charlie?
I might go to Oxford
What does university mean?
Well...
Well I don't think I need to go to university
'cause I'm not going to be a teacher
I don't think you have to go to university if you want to be an astronaut
When I leave this school
I'm down for Heathfield and Fairfield Manor and then maybe I may want to go to university but I don't know which one yet
I will buy myself a nice new made house, you know
One that's all nice and comfy
I'm going to work in Woolworths
Well, going to Africa and try and teach people who are not civilised to be, more or less good
When I grow up I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that
It's just that the limitations of such things as :
What the audience require and the time don't allow it to be a real study
I mean if we accept this then it....
Okay I think it's probably good entertainment
I don't think we've changed that much
I think we talk, no I don't mean looks
I mean the way we talk I don't think we've changed that much
Well you never lose an
Eastend accent do you
I tell you what, as it goes you've definitely changed
- You think so yeah?
- In facial
You haven't changed a bit have you?
Don't you think so?
I thought I'd got bigger
You might be about an inch bigger yeah
- An inch?
- I know it's unbelievable
That's something I did notice, the way our teeth have changed
Teeth?
Yes
- Mine were out like that and I had them shoved back - Well I noticed the ears actually
Have you not noticed that a lot of people... your ears have been made real fun about them
They've got they're conclusions settled already
They must
...met here today and we've seen the films and we feel as if we know everybody who is in the films now has broken any class barriers that could previously existed and therefore the film itself has possibly defeated its own object
- They do lead me on a bit don't they
- That's what I mean and they hype the program up too much
Yeah and make that you're good and I'm bad
- Or
- Well Vice-versa I think
- No don't be silly
- No I really do, especially the "7" one
People tend to read significance into it that I don't think exists
One of my friends for instance, had me pointed out to him as... being destined to run the farm and being educationally pretty inept, this is obvious from the film
At seven Nicholas was at a one room village school in the Yorkshire Dales
Do you have a girlfriend?
I don't want to answer that
I don't want answer those kind of questions
I thought that one would come up because when I was
When I was doing the other one somebody said
"what do you think about girls?" and I said "I don't answer questions like that" is that the reason you're asking it?
- yeah
- thought so
The best answer would be to say that I don't answer questions like that but I mean.. you know it was what I said when I was seven and it's still the most sensible but I mean, what about them?
Well you seemed at fourteen very shy of the whole sexual life, has that changed?
I've tried to make a change yes a very definite conscious effort not to be shy to be more outgoing and this is actually something I can put a point to in my own past and think yes I did make my mind up here, here and here that I was going to try and change this, this and this
"this" being basically my confidence and my my sort of approach to well this is to people in general
When I grow up I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that
I mean
I'm not when I said that I was interested in physics and chemistry well I'm not going to do that here
You might be able to get... somebody to ex... will you explain this to me again
Nicholas is now in his
2nd year at Oxford University
Well I'm trying to be a physicist to fill in the detail of whenever you meet somebody at university that the standard question is, where are you and what are you doing? and my answer is I'm at Merton
College and I'm doing Physics so it doesn't move up and down and just rotates
- OK
- Then you put it in
We'll give it a whirl
So what career are you going to pursue?
It depends whether I'll be good enough to do what I want to really do
I would like if I can to do research
Are there any disadvantages in coming from a small place like this and preparing yourself for Oxford?
Well it's a rather different background to go any where,
Oxford perhaps especially it is a rather more firm foundation I would've thought as to your character? I don't? perhaps character than being brought up in the city
It's a fixed reference point in a sense that sort of earthy life and death cycle that you get living on a farm so when something dies it rots and feeds back into the earth
Sometimes it's helpful in a city where things that some people are very concerned about seem quite irrelevant
Is there a new strength of your father as a farmer that you think he's trying to teach you
Well you get a certain sort of calmness in some situations take things as they come you become resigned to things if the dog's chasing animals in the wrong direction then you just have to put up with it if it won't do as it's told you become resigned to these things
I suppose yes that's one possibility come on come on lad
I suppose of all the seven year olds the original ones, you are the big success
I am not inclined to accept that
Why? You wouldn't agree with that?
Well what have I achieved?
I'm not really prepared to accept that
I've done anything very special yet
I'd like to think that....I mean I'm hoping that I might do at some stage but I don't really think I've done anything that you can call a great success
It would seem really ridiculous to any of my friends who watch this if I said
"Christ aren't I a great success, look at me"
Well what? You know, what success?
I can't think of it in those terms
I haven't done anything that can be called success nothing out of the ordinary really
Singing Waltzing
Matilda in Latin at an exclusive pre-preparatory school in London
Charles
Andrew and John
I think it's not a bad idea to pay for schools because if we didn't schools would be so nasty and crowded
Yes, so do I think so
The poor people would come rushing in and the man in charge of the school would...
Would you think there's any truth in the ideas behind the program that certain people have more options than others and this is undesirable?
It's certainly true that more people know they have more options or imagine they have
I think in practical terms the difference in numerical number of options isn't that great the fact is that the three of us know that there's a whole range of things we can do
But the mere knowledge creates an option in itself, so I think we do have more options and it is undesirable but it's very difficult to correct
I don't think it is undesirable at all
I think what's undesirable is people who have had options don't make advantage of them, take best advantage of them but I can't see there's anything wrong as long as people don't abuse the opportunities and privileges they've had
If people behave responsibly
I think it's very good they're the sort of stability and structure in society
We've been taught to expect more it's not that because we've been to private schools we're not better qualified necessarily
- No
- Yes I agree with that
It's a matter of expectations
Yes I must say, all this talk about opportunities something I did slightly object to in the program was we were shown at the age of seven outlining the academic career that most of us did in fact pursue each sentence ended up
"John is at Westminster"
Andrew is at Charterhouse and everything implied that we just sailed through, merely manifesting an intention at the age of seven we didn't show the sleepless nights, the pouring over our books sort of, you know all the sweat and toil that got us through to university it was presented as if it was just part of some indestructible birth right that we went to all these places and I thought that was unfair, they didn't show us having to do beastly jobs in the holidays y'know, to make ends meet and things it didn't give a very real sort of...impression
The three girls are earning income wise they're far better off than
I imagine all three of us are, certainly I am and background wise in terms of qualifications or the means of achieving their ends they probably have just as many options as we do
Jaqueline how do you think about coloured people?
Well they're nice, they're just the same as us really but, one thing it's only 'cause their skin's brown and we're white sort of pinkish we are
Jackie, Lynn and Susan they went to primary school together in the Eastend of London
Lynn chose to go on to a grammar school and Jackie and Susan to a comprehensive
There is a danger that you would get married at early twenties and have children quickly and then be stuck at home have you any thoughts on that?
- I don't really think about it much
- No
I don't think I'd eh.... get married to early
I'd like to have a full life first and
- I'd like to enjoy myself before I...
- Meet people and...yeah
Before you can commit yourself to a family
What would you do if you had lots of money? about two pounds
I would buy myself a nice new made house you know one that's all nice and comfy
Jackie was married last year and now lives on a new estate in Essex
- It's a nice estate
- Yeah - Yeah not bad at all
What are they like the neighbours?
Have you seen a lot of them or what?
Well you know, to say hello to more than anything, I mean we borrow things off of her, which is just as well
- That's what neighbours are for isn't it?
- Yeah right!
Here, It's a similar colour scheme down here moving up stairs isn't it?
Yeah but this was more by luck than judgement really
- Was it like this when you came?
- No it was all white but you can imagine the state it was in friends had some paint handy so Dad and Mick just used the rollers and in a day it was done two coats, wallop! that was it
Susan is still single
I work for a travel company they don't deal with the public, they deal with groups and company groups it's sort of incentive, holidays abroad and conferences, that sort of thing which I like because
I like foreign places and I have to do eh....
I do quite a bit of typing but a lot of my work is involved in making bookings and dealing with hotels abroad
I left school and started work... for an Australian bank and I'm still there and I've been there what?
Three and a half years now
I've done various jobs within the bank
I started off as a telephonist-typist which was very interesting actually, you'd be surprised the sort of calls you get
Then I went on to work the NCR machine which is the actual machine that processes the accounts and counter work dealing with clients money and things like that
I'm going to work in Woolworths
Well I'm a school mobile librarian and assistant to the young peoples office
Which is where we are now and I've been here since August last year
Lynn is now married but still lives and works in the Eastend
I visit schools with the van where they've not got position to get into a local library for class visits
I love working with children do you remember on the last one I wanted to teach?
Well I didn't get to that and seeing how it is today I'm glad I didn't the job situation for all teachers as it is and I think it takes a lot more patience than I've actually got
I'm much more at home here
- Have I stamped yours?
- Yes
I've not stamped yours
Sleeping Beauty
I've lost the stamp!
Do you sleep like a beauty?
What do you say?
Thank you
I definitely make a point in reading all my new books I get in
It's quite funny, I take loads of books home and people come and say "who are these kids books on the table?"
- "They're mine"
- "Oh"
Then they sort of shut up
At the moment a career's probably about the furthest thing from my mind and I don't really know what I'm aiming for except to get the house together and that can take years, as fast as you replace one thing something else needs replacing, so ... it could just go on like that, I don't know
Well admitting that you're not a career girl does it mean that you're therefore looking for a family?
Oh I don't know,
I suppose I am
But erm.. every thing's not that cut and dried it's not either career or family or... but is what's in the middle, am I just going to carry on as I am now? for? and end up .....on the shelf? or am I just going to get married? could be any day, but
I suppose Lynn is a career girl in a way isn't she?
Yeah she's more wrapped up in her job than I think we are and you all three were sat there at seven and she's gone that way and you've gone this way is there? can you?.... think of any reasons why that should be?
I think just basic personality, Lynn's always been that little bit different from us
She's always been more serious as far as studies are concerned
I didn't feel like going to a grammar school, I just er... you know, comprehensive school it just seemed more friendly
At that time that is, but now a little bit different
- Grammar school's fantastic
- If you say so!
When I leave this school
I'm down for Heathfield and Fairfield Manor and then maybe I may want to go to university but I don't know which one yet
This is Susie the product of a private education and wealthy parents
What do you think about making this program?
I just think it's ridiculous, I don't see any point in doing it
Why not?
What's the point of people going into peoples lives and saying:
"Why do you like this and why don't you?" I don't see any point in it
Well I didn't want to do it when I was fourteen
I know I was very difficult because I was very anti doing it because I was pressurised into doing it by my parents and I hated it and I vowed I'd never do it now but here I am
I'd like to do... short hand typing or something like that
I left school when I was sixteen, went to Paris went to secretarial college and got a job
What made you decide to leave school and go to Paris?
I just wasn't interested in school and just wanted to get away and why did you choose Paris?
I don't know, it was my parents really
Did you sort of feel the need to get away? and why?
Well I'd lived in
London or Scotland and I knew people who were going out to Paris and so I thought I'd go as well
Comparing yourselves to Susie who stands at the other end of the social scale do you think you've had the same opportunities as her?
I've had the opportunities in life that I've wanted
I'd say I've had more opportunities than Susie
I'd say I've had more opportunities than her in a different aspect to what she's had them
But eh, my life,  I've been able to do more or less what I wanted to do
I'm not going to say it on film, what i feel for her
But I think she's been so conditioned into what she should do and what she shouldn't do
Yeah but I mean
The whole thing is you're saying
"do we envy anything Susie's had?"
No
I mean I don't know
I don't know what Susie's had, what's Susie had that I haven't had?
I mean, until I know that I can't honestly say whether I envy her
- She's had money and she's travelled
- I've got money!
Maybe not enough but I've got it!
I have been to Honolulu with my father about two years ago for a couple of months which I didn't really enjoy there's nothing much out there, there's no meet people my own age out there and I hated it and I was glad to come home apart from that I've been to France on holidays
I'm going to Australia in the summer for about two months otherwise I don't know where I'm going to go and I'd like to go and travel more
Why?
Well I don't think there's any point in sitting in your own country
I'd like to see how people live on the other side of the world
Tell me about the
Australian trip
Well I'm going in July for about two months with my cousin her elder sister's married out there and we're just going out to.... see what it's like we're going to not work out there, we're only going for two months
We just feel if we don't go now we never will
We've got the opportunity and the time to go now so we're going
How are you going to pay for it?
Save up and go
Do you get depressed by money problems?
No, why?
Why should you?
- If you can manage on what you've got
- I refuse to get depressed over money
- It's so easy to but why should you?
- I do, I do
Why worry about it?
When I reach the 18th day of the month and my mortgage is due on the 20th and there's nowhere near enough money in there, I get depressed about it obviously
Suddenly thinking, oh my god what's going to happen, you know
But it gets there, don't ask me how but you get it
Do you think you've settled down to young?
No
I've married and we do things together, or...
I go out on my own sometimes with friends from work he does the same, what do you mean by settled down?
If you think that getting married as far as we're concerned is a case of going to work, come home, cook tea for hubby, going to bed, getting up, going to work you're totally mistaken
Did you meet enough men before you decided who to marry?
I've been married a year and... a couple of months you do think "christ, what have I done?"
- See I've still got my ideals
- and I'm being honest about it! and my husband thinks the same, at times you think "christ, what have I done?"
- But then if...
- But marriage...
Marriage means a different thing to me
I've still got my ideals about marriage, I don't know what it's all about, obviously
So I've still got pictures of
- Cosy evenings indoors...yeah
- With roses!
She'd have cosy evenings indoors with the central heating!
Or lack of it!
- Yeah, I've got a lot to learn about .... getting married
I mean, your parents split up soon after you were fourteen
What sort of influence, effect did that have on you?
Well I was the only child going through their parents splitting up aged 14 at a very vulnerable age and it does touch you up, but...
You know, you get over it
There was no point in them staying together for me if it was worse,
I mean the rows and... and it's worse so if two people can't live together there's no point in making yourself even for the sake of children
What is your attitude towards marriage? for yourself?
Well I don't know, I haven't given it a lot of thought as I'm very cynical about it
But then you get a certain amount of faith restored in it
I mean I've got friends and their parents are happily married and it does put faith back into you but me myself I'm very cynical about it
Why?
Because I think it kills whatever love is it just seems to go wrong
What do you base that on?
Well, people I've seen, people around me
I mean I've got....not a lot of my friends are married a lot of people who are 20,30 all seem to be getting divorced and can't stay together and at the moment I just don't really believe in it
Why do you think people can't hold marriages together?
I don't know, I really don't know
I don't sort of sit down and think "ooh ...analyse marriage"
It's not something I've had to think about whether I was going to get married and I've got no desire to at the moment, I think twenty is far too young
What was the wedding like?
Our wedding? a laugh!
I wanted, white wedding, all trimmings
My husband would've been satisfied with very little but being as we were going into it as a full thing we went into it
I had an all white wedding, all white
We were both in white and my bridesmaid was in white
It's a funny day actually because I suppose I was up somewhere around the five o'clock mark and I spent all day preparing well all morning I should say and then sitting around for about three hours just waiting for something to happen then when it did happen I don't remember it
So it was just complete confusion really
- It was a nice day though
- Oh yeah
It was funny actually, you can imagine some of the comments
I was pleased I was there, it seemed the right place to be
I mean I was glad I was at her wedding, I've known her a long while
Did anything happen?
Anything funny?
I can’t forget the cake
It was horrific really, the cake what happened to the wedding cake it was sitting right in between Mick and myself suddenly the columns just completely gave way and it just all fell into one
- It was a nice cake though!
- Yeah it wasn't bad!
I read the Financial Times
I read the Observer and the Times
What do you like about it?
Well I like...
I usually look at the headlines then read about them about it
I like my newspaper because
I've got shares in it
- and I know every day what the shares are
- The stuff that misers like you like!
But on Monday's they don't move up so I don't look at it
That's one of the troubles with this sort of program, I don't really think that people like us
Unless we're seven and being rather funny, have very much to say that's... very interesting, because I mean... we don’t know very much
Well we didn't know very much when we were seven
- But we were still quite funny
- We were at least funny!
- Yes! - Yes!
- In ourselves!
I agree with John, all we can say is what we think and if that's of interest to people, good luck to them
Yes and I can't believe it is
More fool them!
When I leave this school
I'm going to College Court then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam and then we think I'm going to
Cambridge and Trinity Hall
John is in his final year at
Christchurch Oxford, reading Law
I do believe parents have a right to educate their children as they think fit
I think someone who works on an assembly line in a car factory, earning a huge wage could well afford to send their children to private school if they wanted to
Just because.. some sort of people perhaps don't put that as high on their priorities as... having a smart car or something
I don't think that's any reason for abolishing public school
I think an awful lot more people could afford to send their sons to school
You know, to fee paying school
But they don't choose to, and that's their choice
I'm going to Charterhouse and after that,
Trinity Hall Cambridge
Andrew is in his last year at Trinity
College Cambridge, reading Law
I think if people earn their money they should have a right to spend it an education is very important and you can never be sure of leaving your children any worldly goods but at least you can be sure that once you've given them a good education that's something that no one can take away
What about university Charlie?
I might go to Oxford
You're reading history at Durham
University, you didn't make Oxford
What are your feelings about that?
I don't mind at all
In fact
I'd say I'm pleased I didn't because it was very much a sort of sort of set of
Marlborough Prep School
Marlborough, Oxbridge, conveyor belt you get shoved out at the end and you... when you go to Oxbridge and it's obviously not true in all cases but
I think for the majority they mix with the same people they were at school with
So what attracts you to Oxford?
Well first of all it's such a beautiful place there's more to it than just studying away at one's books
I think it's very difficult not to get something out of it there’s such a sort of... atmosphere of culture and... and timelessness about the place that
I think you do sort of mature an awful lot
So what is Beagling?
Beagling is the hunting of the hare with a pack of hounds, done on foot
I mean a lot of people seem to imagine a days hunting with either fox to hunt or beagles unadulterated butchery.
I mean this just isn't true, I think
I wish people had a more realistic idea of what it's about
The hounds are over there I think
I saw them last streaming along that hedge there
- Frustrating isn't it?
- Yes
I'm reasonably old fashioned about some things but I mean
I mean people who go on a lot about the permissive society are missing the point if they think the only thing that's wrong is sex
I think you know, decreasing respect for the family as a unit increasing dishonesty, both in business.... there used to be much more much stronger developed ideas of commercial integrity than seem to be going around nowadays, nowadays people seem to be out for themselves
I really do think I suppose there is an invasion by the American way of life which I think is a very sad thing
Is that unstoppable?
That trend do you think?
I think it really is unfortunately, yes
So where does that leave your values?
Well it leaves them with me and my future children whom
I shall implicate them in
But do you not find yourself isolated?
That really doesn't matter
If I believe my principals are right and I'm doing the right thing to bring my children up by them it won't matter to me whether
I'm living in the middle-ages mentally
I shall do what's right
Well when I was very small my father always used to go ski-ing and he took me with him and we've been ever since really and how old or young were you when you started?
Oh about five, on tiny little ski's it was quite frightening then what is the appeal of it?
Well the sort of freedom and going in the snow and the mountains and the feeling of speed and getting away from people if you can
Do you save up to come ski-ing or...?
I don't but my father does as he pays for me
Your parents have been divorced since fourteen
- Since you were fourteen
- That's right, quite recently yes
Tell me about that and the influence it's had on you
Well not much influence in fact because it's happened when I'm quite old and I'm away from home a lot anyway it's very sad of course but I don't think it has had a great deal of influence if it had happened when I was much younger it would've had much more influence an adverse influence
I would've thought
Did your parents divorce leave any lasting mark on you?
I don't know, I mean seen the film at fourteen so and that's of our closest time,
I would've thought it did but... don't talk about that anyway so...
Why?
I think it's unfair on them
Very few parents I think, bring up their children... with the intention of belittling them or doing as little for them as possible
I think you have to assume that most parents do as much as they can given the circumstances of the children and obviously things could've been far worse
Do you think it's changed your attitude to marriage? or...
It just means that because I was faced with that situation I have an attitude which is a positive attitude rather than "well everybody else gets married therefore I shall get married"
My attitude would be that if one is going to have children if you want to have children then that's a very real reason for getting married but if you get married... it's an agreement to make the thing work for eighteen years or however long it is until the children have grown up no there's no point in just sitting it out for eighteen years there's nothing worse than that, it would be better for the parents to get a divorce
I think people perhaps don't make as much effort as they should have, or should do to make marriages work it's very easy for me to say so as
I've never been in the position
In what way should people make more effort?
I think people just take too much for granted when they get married or used to, not now perhaps
I mean, I don't know about you for instance
I know my mother, she's said that she's spoilt really and she never realised how lucky she'd been until she'd been divorced
Up to about twelve maybe it's different with other people, but
I found that you're much more attached to your parents once you come to about thirteen, fourteen you're not quite so attached to them
I think the system of having house captains is rather good because when somebody is naughty the house captain asks him and... and has a talk to him once I had a talk to Grevil, he was in my house and
I asked Sir if he could put him out of my house because he was always getting minuses
What did Sir say?
Sir said that he would... we would see about it this term
Well I think it's a very good system
Have you had to speak to anyone?
- Just because you are one I suppose?
- No, no I haven't!
- You're not are you?
- But I am!
Straw, Mac and Nessie got three minuses in a day
If I work in Law I should like a reasonable amount of success
I shouldn't like to be on the bread-line which is all to common
I'd like to be a Solicitor and, also fairly successful
I only know what I don't want and that's a nuclear family in a semi-detached in Brentford
Do you three see yourselves... staying in England, living in England, making your careers in England?
Yes
Well the trouble is Law is not really very exportable
From my point of view anyway
I quite like England
'cause I can't say I really approve very much of the sort people who emigrate
I mean it's too easy for people who... this is where I would agree with you about people who have had opportunities
I do think they've got a corresponding duty to sort of put back.... you know, people who have had things going well for them really ought to stay and help the country out when things aren't going very well
I don't believe in all this pulling one's money out but that's a moral point of view, I do believe people have the right to live where they like and also to move their assets around but on a moral level I do feel very strongly that people shouldn't quit
- Is that why you don't want to leave?
- Yes and also I can't imagine anywhere so nice as England
Probably stay in England for the reasons that
John put forward, I think one has a moral duty
It sounds terrible but,  you know...if...
It's up to one certainly to make an attempt to put something back in to whatever it is that you're doing in England
Having used the various facilities that are put out for you by the state
I think the more you've had out of the country the more privileges you're born with the greater your duty is
We chose two boys from a children's home in Middlesex
Paul
Say you had a wife say you had to eat what they cooked you and say I don't like vegetables, well I don't and say she said "you have to eat what you get"
So I don't like vegetables so say she gives me vegetables then that's it
Well as far as I know my mother and father got... well they separated originally I think they eventually got divorced
I went to the boarding school for one year then we emigrated to Australia my father got remarried and how do you get on with your step-mum? pretty well but like I said before I'm just not close enough
I'm not really close to my father either
Paul left the children's home when he was eight
Our other boy stayed until he was thirteen
Symon
Was it difficult moving from the home back to live with your mother?
- You're still here after, eight years now?
- Yeah yeah
Well I find it's comfortable
See I can get on well with my mother sometimes well that's good because a lot of ... young children can't get on with their parents at all at this time of the year, their life but I get on pretty well with my mum now we talk very well with each other but it's.. sometimes not quite as mother and son sort of more like friends
What sort of life does your mother have?
Well it seems hard, I mean she's always been... nervous not all the time, but... she has periods of depression or deep depression or whatever you want to call it that sort of makes me think
"well what happened there?"
What effect has that had on you do you think?
Well it's made me very sort of protective towards her
I feel I've got to help her all the time
They say "Where's your father then?"
You know when your mums out at work "Where's your father?" and I just tell them
I ain't got one
What effect has that had on you?
Well I don't think it's had any effect on me, 'cause... what you don't have you don't miss
Twenty years ago when I was born an illegitimate child, you know that's something that's only whispered about people feel strongly about it in those days but nowadays it's.. it's not a serious matter the serious point is whether you stay with someone or you leave them
We took Paul and Symon round the buildings which were once the children's home
I remember this path but I've never walked on it was out of bounds the only place I saw this was from out the windows and that
- What was that there?
- That? That was eh...
That was hospital juniors, that's where we used to be
- Really?
- Yeah
I don’t like the big boys
Hitting us and... and the staff is up in the washroom sends the nurse out,
"well there's no talking"
"No I wasn't talking today"
Then Brown sent me out for nothing
Remember the tiles?
- No not really
- Yeah I remember them when they were cleaner
- I remember the two offices
- Yeah the doctors and the nurses
Some things gone
- The seats
- Yeah the seats
The smell, the smells gone
- Remember Midgely
- Yeah
He was a real bastard
I remember one night,
I forget what I actually did
But he made me clean all the shoes in the house there was about fifty pair of shoes and took about two hours or something
Well I feel like joining in when there's already a fight
Ah do you remember Froggy Page?
No
He was the tailor
- I remember him
- Tailor?
Yeah he was here for thirty-seven years or something bent over backwards or bent over forwards or something
- The golf course
- Yeah
Used to think about running away over that when you'd get scared
That's where the headmaster's son used to shoot the squirrel's off the trees isn't it - yeah
Do you remember the boy that in the senior part where my brother was, he he was sleeping one time and he went out the second story window
Oh the sleep walker,
Weaver, Robert Weaver
- We all had to pray for him
- Yeah
- Everybody said he had a steel plate in his head
- Yeah
How have you got on with Symon? after you haven't seen him for fourteen years
Well I didn't recognise him at all
I think we got along really well, I don't know what he'd say to that but
I found him very likeable
He's just the sort of person who if I could I'd like to do something for them
Because I feel I've got, no offence to him, but I feel I've got more than him
It's just that it seems to me that things have fallen into line now for me
Every thing's started to come good, I've started to enjoy life and I've started to think
"well I'm not a no hoper"
Because I think that's what
I've always thought about myself
I know I didn't have any confidence in myself despite what I said when I was fourteen
I've always lacked confidence
I still do to a certain extent but nothing nothing like I did say when I was fourteen
The job I'm in, I mean, brick laying
I mean I enjoy it, it interests me and I'm very content at work in June last year I was made a junior partner though that was through circumstances but I look at it this way
I'm not great with my life but if I wasn't good enough and my boss didn't think I was good enough he would've never made me a junior partner as for the job you know, you build a house then you turn around and look at it and say "well I did that" it's better than having a whole row of figures it's substance you know, there's something there
Symon works in the freezer room of a meat company near his home in Middlesex
My job’s running away from me
You do jobs which I suppose are fairly routine and dull
- Yeah
- What keeps you going during them?
Oh it's definitely the people there
You work up a kind of team spirit there, y'know what I mean
You can ..... think about all the work you've got to do in the morning and you just don't want to go but once you get there just sort of generally....
I was going to say messing around there, I won't say that the managers might see it sort of joking about they make you feel you want to get the work done
Go out and get some just ask for them and we always say when we come out of the chiller we don't want to go back in but when we get back in we get on with it
So are you a good time keeper?
Ah it depends
Usually I try to get to work early but I have periods of where I just say "sod it" if I get there I get there
I think the hardest thing is to get up in the morning for me it takes a great deal out of me now
Do you never feel you should be doing better jobs than these?
Aren't you worth more than this?
No I haven't really
I suppose I just like hard work, I don't know
But eh...
It's never really sort of worried me
I suppose it should but it just hasn't and how do you see the future as far as work goes?
Well I know I can't stay at Walls forever, I mean it's just not me
I couldn't stay there for that long, my mind would go dead
But eh...
I think if I really wanted to
I could learn a trade, even now
Y'know if I really felt that I ought to get out and do something different
I could learn a trade if I wanted to and what would you like to be doing say in seven years?
Well I couldn't really say I haven't thought one year ahead yet
I think I'm still sort of young in my head
I don't really sort of take things seriously
All I want out of life is to be happy and when I say happy I want to be happily married as well because I can't say I don't want to get married because I think I do but I want to be happily married y'know therefore I want to make sure I think
How would you define happiness? What is it?
Basically to me it's the will to live
I mean, me I literally love life, I love people
I mean I think before I didn't
I mean, when I was fourteen I said
I've forgotten what the question was but I said something about I want to be alone and when I said that I know even now I meant that if someone had dropped me out in the Sahara Desert
I probably would've been happy more or less if you get the point
Whereas I'm not like that now,
I'd sooner be around people
I don't like doing things by myself and happiness to me is a love for life and a love for people
I think I admire people with great determination y'know like people who just come up from nothing they build up their life from absolutely nothing
I could say Muhammad Ali because he absolutely came from nothing
I mean you can't agree with everything he says but his word goes down now he's the biggest thing in sport he's one of the biggest things in life
I mean people like him
What when you look at yourself do you think your weaknesses and strengths are?
I think my main weakness is
I don't really take a grip of life
I don't really look...
I always look deeply into it but it just seems to be ... just a sort of hobby with me, I look at everything and I criticise it and I work everything out but after that I just sort of leave it
I find it hard to express emotion most of the time although I'm getting on top of that more happy now? just the simple things to say to Susan, y'know "I love you" or something like that
I mean I can tell you about it but
I really haven't been able to say it freely to Susan
I suppose that's a weakness
Do you have a dream?
A dream? not....
Not so much a dream but I know if I ever wanted to get on I could do it
I mean I always feel that I've got something inside me that would make me move
But eh...
I think what it is really is I'm just waiting for an excuse to use it
Y'know at the moment I feel ok just getting on with my life just sort of keeping up but I know if I really wanted to I could get on
It'll only take a little spark with me to do it
Is it important to fight? Yes
Would everybody please sit round now and get on with their work
I don't want to see any backs to me
Shouldn't be anybody turning round, Tony do you hear aswell?
Get on with your work in front
Tony!
Don't turn round again
I want to be a jockey when I grow up yeah I want to be a jockey when I grow up
Tony left his Eastend secondary modern school at fifteen and became an apprentice at
Tommy Gosling's racing stables in Epsom
This is a photo finish of when I rode at Newberry
I'm the one with the white cap
I was beaten a length and a half for third and had a photo finish so I took it out the box and kept it as a souvenir
Have you any other pictures of you as a jockey?
Yeah I've got a lot of them
Show me that one
That one when I was at Windsor that was my last ride on the old horse, Sharrod Heath that was he was a lovely old horse,
I'll never forget him
How many rides did you have?
Only three
Why was that?
Well obviously if I was good enough I would've had more that was the first day I ever put myself in jockey silks that was my first ride ever
How did it feel like?
It feel like there's no words that can explain how it felt that one was when I was going to the parade ring
They're not very good my brother, I mean he's not no good at taking photos
He's no Lord Snowdon
But describe the feeling, go on
Describe, well....I mean I..
Frankie Durr right, he was told to look after me so I went in there I said "I don't know my first ride" and he said "alright don't worry, your boss has told me to look after you" and so
I was changing into my silks and I felt good y'know, I could see all the faces that I think and when I look at the newspaper I think, Jeff Lewis, Frankie Durr and...
I thought to myself all of a sudden I'm in the same room getting changed
Then I walked in the parade room the parade ring and eh... and all my family's there and they're all going "Go on Tone!" and the boss came over and he said you've got to do this to the horse, you hold him back, you go half pace keep your hands down, keep him in the rails and I'm going "yeah yeah" like, nod and all of a sudden when he said "Jockeys please mount" and the bell went "Ding ding" and my heart just sunk because I thought to myself
Here I was yesterday a sort of nobody and here I am today, I'm king like
I felt king for one day, well for ten minutes
Do you regret not making it?
Well I would've given my right arm at the time to become a jockey
But now... well I wasn't good enough, it's as easy as that
What will you do if you don't make it as a jockey?
I don't know
If I knew I couldn't be one I'd get out of the game wouldn't bother and what do you think you would do then?
Learn taxi's
Taxi driver
I will be a cab driver right, how can I fail?
I got one brother taxi driver pulling me and the other brother pushing me so I got to make it
I will be a cab driver and I know I will and I'm going to prove every person who thinks I can't be a cab driver wrong and I'm going to get that badge and put it right in their face just to tell them how wrong they can be and how under estimated I am
Doing the taxi knowledge means Tony going out on his motorbike every day and learning the hundreds of routes round the streets of London
Well I can just get up, go on my bike, do two runs, come home call them over then boom, I've done my days work then I go out here and earn my money
Hackney Wick it's my sort of living
I can say until the time
I am a cab driver
But  mean my freedom's here and that is the main thing what I want
Tony spends his spare time at Hackney Wick
Greyhound Stadium placing bets for the punters
Fifty-five to twenty Boris
Five to one Cooladine
Four and a half fifty's, four and a half fifty's
Poor-Sunshine fourteen to one
Take it, take it!
If your father gambles you always looked upon how he gambles
I tried my luck and see what he does and I took it from there, it's sort of in you some people drink and they can't get out of drinking, some people smoke and can't stop smoking well I think I'm firmly on the ground as a gambler
I know you can't win gambling, putting money on the dogs and horses, I know that
But when you put other peoples money on you can't lose
What do they call you here?
I reckon a pest, or something like that
'cause I'm always running and doing everything that I shouldn't be doing
I thought I was going to get barred one day 'cause I used to...
Well I don't mean to make a nuisance of myself
I mean if the other patrons of the place they don't want to see a little boy nipping between their feet running, putting a bet on for a person
You understand? they think "cor what's he doing is he mad?"
I mean I walk up there
I order the teas
There could be eight people in front of me, I just go...
Can I have a tea please, tea please, five times tea please tea please and they've got to serve me before them to get rid of me, do you understand?
So that’s how you've got to do it
Just keep on and on and on and they go
"oh driving me mad, here you are, get rid of him" it's as easy as that
That's the way to get on in life, just be a noise, annoyed annoyance all the time to a person and they go
"oh he's driving me mad, get him away from me and more or less they give you the first option sort of find that
You're very short, has that had much trouble?
Well a bird said to me the other day
She said "ain't you small"
So I said "but you're ugly at least I can grow"
What can they say to that? they can't say nothing can they? to a thing like that, or... or example...
She said to me "Ain't you small" so I looked at her tits and she was only about a thirty
I said "But you're not too big either so we're both in the same way"
- Have you got a girlfriend?
- No
Would you like to have a girlfriend?
No
Do you understand "The Four F's?"
Find the, feed them, forget them for the other F I'll let you use your own discrimination
I mean... this one
I tried to do the three F's but I couldn't forget her
I'd done the three F's but I couldn't forget her
It sounds silly but that's the only way I can put it
Tell me about the family, are you fairly closely knit?
Well I love them all
There's not one I don't love more than the other, other than my mum obviously but your mum is the root of the tree, you love your mum best
So what do you like about living in the Eastend?
It's very sort of real, there's nothing false only the police!
I'm firmly placed and there's no way I can see getting out, I wouldn't want to get out really
It's very hard to make it in the Eastend because the roots are firmly stuck in the ground and you've got to have a big hard pull to get them out
So are there many villains in the Eastend?
There has been in the time I suppose the originals were the Kray twins
We're in Vallance Rd now, as it goes they used to live here in a house they used to call Fort Vallance
'cause it was that hard to get into I expect
Do you have much to do with villains?
I can't say I have much to do,
I wouldn't say I'm a villain myself
I don't go thieving and don't do anybody any harm fighting wise
I'm trying to say that
Wherever you go there's villains and whether you mix with them or not it's up to you
Does it worry you the possibility of becoming one of them?
How can I become a villain?
If it's not in there, it's not born in there you won't become one
Don't you think you're going to regret not having an education?
Where does that come into it? it doesn't come into it in my mind?
Education is just a thing to say
"my son is higher than him" or "my son had a better background than him"
I mean
I'm as good or even better than most of them people especially on this program
I mean
On one of the trailers you'll think oh the Eastend boy and he ain't got a no good education but all of a sudden the Eastend boy's got a car and a motorbike and he goes to Spain every year and whatever and have I worked for it?
No I'm here putting bets on and you think "how does he do it?" and there's a boy, who's he? and whatever he's studying to be a professor, he's making up things
They're mainly education, there's no education in this world
Just one big rat race and you've got to kill your man next to you to get in front of him
What do you think about trade unions and things like that?
I don’t under know I don't
I don't know enough to know about them if you understand me
I mean
I'm not a politician so let them worry about what's coming for the next day all I understand is dogs, prices, girls, knowledge, roads, streets, squares and mum and dad and love that's all I understand that's all I want to understand
Here you are
Come on three chase it
Come on boy
Go on three inside
Come on three???
He's checking everywhere....
Well going to Africa and try and teach people who are not civilised to be more or less good
No I don't want to be a missionary because
I just can't talk about it to people
Y'know, I am interested in it myself but I wouldn't be very good at it at all and I wouldn't enjoy it
Why wouldn’t you be good at it
Well I'm just not very good at... at standing up in front of people and making a speech or anything like that
I'd like to keep it private, y'know
Is it possible you might ever think of going to the church?
It is possible, I've never said no definitely
But I wouldn't be doing it after I go to university
I mean it's just possible in ten years time I suppose
What would draw you to the church?
I don't know, it wouldn't be dissatisfaction with whatever I'm doing at the moment
In a way
If whatever I was doing I was doing very successfully then that would be a better reason for going into the church really or at least if I did go into the church it would meant I was giving something up
But
I think the wrong reasons are if you are dissatisfied with what you're doing in the general sense of doing a job badly or a failure in some sort of way
Bruce is in his final year at University
College Oxford, reading mathematics and by Eisenstien you can show that this is irreducible then you do a transformation on this ???? x = to T+2 which you find is T cubed plus
17 squared plus 14 T plus 7 and you observe that seven which is a prime divides the co-efficient of T squared
T and the constant, not T cubed and seven squared doesn't divide the constant term so by Eisenstien this is irreducible so therefore two cross, two by seven is of degree three and that length isn't constructable from the quarry of our original theorem so therefore the septagon's not constructable
Well that's a nice way of doing it, particularly using Eisenstien down here his test is very popular, he was an interesting mathematician
What sort of job are you going to try for?
Well there was one job, I'd like to make maps really and it's nice sort of outdoor life you go to...I mean you travel around and eh... but there are very few jobs like that going
I'm sort of qualified, a general maths or science degree would do or geography degree
But eh...
I think I've probably missed it this time round and eh....but that's only.... perhaps I won't like making maps, it's something that I think I would do
Millbrook probably had a great influence on me in a way
I mean I was absolutely shocked rigid when I went to my prep school and found people who thought of doing things wrong
I never really upset anyone or questioned authority or misbehaved in any of my two later schools which may seem an ideal thing but it's probably healthy to question why you have to do certain things which I never did
Bruce was a border at this pre-preparatory school from the age of five
Squad left foot in one place squad breathe in
Well it is mainly this lack of responsibility for doing jobs given to me people will say "why haven't you done this? Look you've upset us"
I was secretary of bridge society, chess society, cricket society
Scottish dancing society and I didn't do anything for any of them, they were all very angry and I spent last summer term in total seclusion
I saw maybe half a dozen people all term in my room, darting across courts people would say "I saw Balden today" and they'd say "No? really?" it was awful really
My hearts desire is to see my daddy who is six thousand miles away
Y'know I've been getting on well with my step-father and I like seeing my father occasionally and he does come over from Rhodesia
What effect has the fact that you've seen very little of your father had on you?
Nothing really, I only
...something I regret that...
I didn't really get to know him better at all
We've written and we're both very bad writers, I'm probably worse than him and eh... that's something I regret is not having a just a regular correspondence because I think he's an interesting man actually and eh... he probably regrets it as well
What do you think about your own upbringing? what have been the strongest influences on that?
Probably to not let down my mother really because she's worked awfully hard to get me through school and
I haven't let her down yet then.. as far as...eh
...not having... my mothers divorce
I don't think that really has the effect that people imagine it to have
I mean I always have got on well with my stepfather and with my half-sister, so in that sense I've had a family life
I'd help people if I had a chance
Y'know by say giving a little bit of money to charity or sponsoring things or things like that
Well I took nine months off between school and university and there I taught at a school and worked in the Banbury sewage works two months
What sort of school was it?
Well I never like admitting this but it was a handicapped school
I mean it seems to present me as wanting to do these things
I suppose in a way I do, and
I do get some satisfaction from doing it, but....
I could so easily have done something else it was just almost an accident that
I ended up at the spastic school and eh...
I'm glad I did it because I enjoyed it not for its....
I suppose slightly charitable nature of the work, but the people I met, work, it was quite good
Why are you frightened of presenting this image of yourself
It's...
It’s possibly because I
I don't know, I never want to feel to proud really
I mean it's dangerous for a start and it's so easy and it doesn't work in a way because I can try and pretend to be humble that's being proud in just the same sort of way
I find it a very difficult thing to avoid, pride
Tell me, are you interested in politics at all?
Not as much as I was
I am about the only socialist in my village and I go into the pub and sort of expect to stand up and defend all socialist policies sort of, this is the village socialist no, village idiot, sorry you agree with all this immigration so I stand up and defend it and it's awfully hard work though
I think I'm going to give that up
So where do you stand politically now then?
I'm still socialist but not as energetically as I was I suppose
What do you think about the way
England's being run at the moment?
Well...
I'm glad the socialist's are in power because
This illusive thing called freedom is sort of rearing its head and the conservatives are pushing it forward and I thought this argument was smashed at the early years of this century but it seems to be coming back and it really is exceptionally dangerous because the more you try and defend freedom you allow everybody to do exactly what they like within limits then the less you have
I mean there's no freedom in living in a slum
It's alright you can say the chap can do whatever he wants he can get a better job or anything but that's just not the case the more you defend freedom the less you have it
Well my girlfriend is in Africa and I don't think I'll have another chance of seeing her again
Have you got any girlfriends?
No, not yet
I'm sure it will come, but not yet
What is your attitude to sex?
Well it's not quite, normal attitude to anti-sex
I mean I as it were burnt my fingers a little
I don't feel as though I'm missing anything now
I don't feel a need for it and I'm quite happy at not feeling a need for it really
I mean I do think a lot of people think too much about it
What happened when you burnt your fingers?
I'd rather not talk about it really well no in fact I don't really mean that
I don't mean I don't want to talk about it it's just I'd need quite a long time to think about it really
Why?
Well in the end I decided the eh... the effect, the pleasure, or... just didn't seem worth it really didn't seem worth...
See I think there's two different sorts there's casual sex then there's sex in love and marriage and casual seks is not...
I don't think it's quite as widespread as people believed because if both the people treat it as casual sex then I think it's alright but if you're sort of looking for
I don't know this may seem awfully silly but if you're looking for casual sex but don't want to treat it as such then it doesn't seem to be worth the lies, I don't know the... the sort of effort
- Is this what happened to you?
- I suppose in a way yes
Have you been in love?
No, no and eh...
I think I'll probably have to wait for that really
Play international wrestling
Yeah that's only at summertime though
Yeah summer we can go on the grass
Neil went to a comprehensive school in Liverpool got four A-levels then walked out of Aberdeen university after one term and is now doing casual labour in London
I came to London I think because
I wanted to start a new life really
I'd left the university in Aberdeen in the end of nineteen seventy-five and I became conscious of the fact that I was drifting around which I suppose I'm still doing here but at least I took the decision to move myself and I think possibly there's more challenge in
London than there ever could be in Aberdeen
Peter, Neil's school friend from Liverpool is now in his last year at
London university, reading history
It was obviously a big step it was exciting more than anything,
I mean that sounds corny but it was
Do you remember the day you left Liverpool?
Yeah very well
It was pouring down with rain, I remember that just had the traditional send of from the train station, my mum and dad were there a couple of mates turned up at the last minute, from the school to see me
- Catch a girl and kiss a girl
- Yeah and what happens then?
- Well the girls are all screaming
- Yeah and then we catch them we kiss them
We're interested in contrast with you and Neil were you aware of differences in home background at the time?
Oh sure yeah, I mean both Neil's parents are teachers as you know that's got to be a hell of a difference for a start
I mean, I'm not knocking them for a minute, they're very nice people but eh... there's obviously going to be some sort of academic type atmosphere in the house which I did notice one or two times but I think Neil whether by design or just by the situation he was in was obviously going to be under more pressure
I came to London and I contacted an agency for squatters and they were able to give me the address of somebody who was able to help people who were looking for accommodation in the London area and by a process of chasing people around
I eventually managed to find this place here
I wouldn't squat in a place which
I knew to be owned by somebody else
I wouldn't, certainly because
I knew if I had a place of my own and found somebody squatting in it I'd be disgusted
But this place was empty and I was simply offered a place to live here and was very grateful for it and I think in questions of squatting a bit of humanity is more important that vain rules about who can live where
In contrast, Peter lives in a flat in North London sharing with three other students there have been three guys living here originally and one of them left to get engaged, virtually married and the flat was meant for four in the first place so Dave and Trev asked Ian and I if we'd like to move in because we did 'cause we'd been searching for a flat for some months so we jumped at the opportunity really
I've got my own room, I can cook whenever I like
I haven't got a landlady to tell me what time to come in
I've got my own front door key and to tell the truth it's a lot better than a lot of the accommodation I've had over the last eighteen months or so it could be a bit warmer, it's a bit chilly but eh... it's perfectly satisfactory for the time being
These are obvious restrictions, y'know not able to cook for yourself you've got to think for yourself a lot more but it's eh... certainly not as exhausting or wearing as I thought it would be
I mean, y'know... coming up myself is a challenge of some sort we're going to have to split two sausages into three now
Well once Caroline Tetford said she loved me and I'm going to marry her when I grow up
I hate her, she's always getting bad tempered and cross with me
- Does she?
- Yeah
She says "Neil Hughes, move your desk forward" and when I put it back she says
"Neil Hughes put your chair forward" and she just gets into a girly mood with me like that
Tell me about the period in your life when you went to university and what happened
It was a very short period
I was only at university... well I was only taking university seriously for a matter of two or three months maybe I went to the wrong university or maybe university life didn't suit me either way
I felt a very great need to get out of the system
Well this is my final year so
I'm not in college that much
I don't have to be so what I'm expected to do is to be ... laying out revision timetables at home and.. working like a slave which I'm not at the moment, but I will be soon
I did make an application to Oxford but I didn't get in and eh well I think that's in the past now and that's...
I don't know whether I would've been any happier at Oxford it always had been a dream to get into Oxford
I think being as people had encouraged me because I knew famous people having been to Oxford
I'd read memoirs written by famous people things such as Brideshead's Revisited which was a great favourite but these I suppose are well they were dreams which
I had while I was at school and
I have to just get over the fact that I didn't get into Oxford probably because I didn't approach the thing in the right way
Are you bitter about it?
I was very bitter at the time maybe I still am but
I try to get over it
I think once I can get myself going I can work solid, yeah but it's the motive which is very hard to acquire when you're in the flat most of the time it's hard to sort of look ahead to next June and think of those exams but I dare say I'll do it, get the average type degree and...
I'm not worried
Is it a problem to you motivating yourself generally?
Yeah it can be
I can look back on the day and think "how I wasted that" although I must've enjoyed it at the time
What sort of influence did your parents have on you?
Well they made me believe in god from the start which I certainly wouldn't or I don't know even now whether I believe in god or not
I've thought an awful lot about it actually and
I still don't know but still this was the absolutely certain one if one was to survive in the world one had to believe in god this was something which was taught to me always think of other people first before yourself to a ridiculous neurotic degree which I think affected me
What do you mean by that?
Well this I suppose is basic christianity it's sort of... if somebody slaps you on one cheek let them do it on the other almost literally taken which gave me a few shocks when I tried to put it into practise
- In what way?
- I don't think to be honest to go back to that question I don't think
I was really taught any sort of policy of living at all by my parents this was probably their biggest mistake that I was just left to fend for myself in a world which they seemed completely oblivious of and I found even when I tried to discuss problems which were facing me in school my parents didn't seem to be aware of the nature of the problem
Were they ambitious for you?
Yeah but along set lines which they had planned
I think they have often said to me that they they had seen me even from when I was very young in a certain type of career and possibly they'd never even thought that anything else was vaguely possible they probably imagined I would be maybe a university lecturer or a bank manager or something like this some kind of indoor work which involved writing and reading and this sort of thing because they didn't take account of the other side of my personality but
I wonder how many parents really think of their children as individual human beings
What are your feelings about them now? Your parents
I'm glad they're there because if I ever become homeless again
I will be able to go back and live with them they wouldn't object to this
I'm capable of getting on with my parents perfectly well
If they are willing to let me live as another adult in their house and appreciate that I'm living my own way of life and that I am living there because I can't think of anything else to do with myself
What do they think of what you're doing now?
They accept it, I think now they do accept that I'm the person I am they see this as simply my attempting to add more experience to my life which satisfies me
Are they worried about you?
Probably yes but no more worried now than they were when I first left for university that was probably the time at which they were most worried and we have in fact managed to discuss a lot of personal things which I felt at one time I'd never be able to discuss and therefore, as I say it is possible for me to live for a few weeks even a month or so at home without there being to much friction
So are you under pressure to get a job to think of what you're going to do when you leave in June
Yeah I suspect I am from my parents, they keep dropping hints which is only fair I can understand their feelings obviously I've got to get a job
I don't want to laze around on the dole for months and months you'd go mad
I just can't see what I'll be doing in nine, ten months time though
Does that depress you or does that excite you?
No it certainly doesn't depress me perhaps it does excite me in a way yes something will turn up, something of that nature y'know but obviously you've got to think realistically about doing something
I mean I might be living in cloud cuckoo land y'know my mum and dad might say "no son"
"you don't get a job you like"
I'd like to think I could
Well, we pretend we've got swords we make the noises of the swords fighting and when somebody stabs us we go "Arrrrrgghhh!"
What goes through your mind when you saw those two films when you were at seven, bright and perky?
I find it hard to believe that I was ever like that but there's the evidence
I wonder why I was like that
I wonder what it was inside me that made me like that and I can see even at fourteen and
I was beginning to get more subdued and I was putting a lot more thought into what I was saying too a ridiculous degree and probably when I was seven I just..... I don't know
I lived in a wonderful world where everything was sensation dumb
I could be happy like this I could be miserable the next minute and I didn't have to plan for the future
I didn't have to worry about having friends and all this money because everything was so mapped out for me
I don't know what sort of stumbling blocks should be put in a child's way to get him used to living in the outside world because I think maybe this is something that was wrong in my upbringing
I didn't have enough obstacles to get over, to toughen myself up against
I was unprepared for things as they were but looking back now I couldn't think of what might have been done and I certainly wouldn't start writing educational theory about this because I know how personal a thing it is and it probably wouldn't work in anybody else's case
Would you like to be seven again?
No because I'd know that I had to be twenty-one again
I moved up to a comprehensive school
I found it much bigger of course
I found it hard to settle into at first but now I've been here a few years I know my way around
I think it's a very good idea to have competition otherwise you might start to relax and not try hard enough
Yes at that age I was very conscious of having to struggle because I suppose of what parents and teachers were saying they were saying they said "you've got a brain you must put all your effort into school work" well what else could they have said?
I would've probably been just as angry, looking back if they'd never encouraged my intellectual efforts at all
When I get married I don't want to have any children because they are always doing naughty things and making the whole house untidy
Do you have any great ambition, any dream?
I suppose I... yes well...
I would like to be someone in a position of importance and I've always thought this but I don't think I'm the right sort of person to carry the responsibility for whatever it is
I've always thought well I'd love to be possibly even love to be in politics
Something like this but eh...
I suppose that I'd probably find just as tedious as all the other jobs I've done so...
What do you want out of life?
The satisfaction of knowing that I've left some sort of imprint rather than just lived out my life
I don't know.... it's going to sound like an epitaph
I've left in memory of some people y'know not that this guy worked, made a fair bit of money, good house, died
I'd like to have done something but... then again it must be a drop in the ocean I suppose
I mean who is going to remember me in a hundred years time?
So is it that important, how you live out your life? but I would like to think
I'm going to do something with it something positive
Do you and Peter have the same values?
I think we both value happiness and stability
I think most people do
But you've kicked against the stability that's..
I don't think I ever had any stability, to be quite honest
I can't think of any time in my life when I ever did
I don't think I've been kicking against anything
I think I've been kicking in mid-air the whole of my life
It's only one more
What do they think about each other? and how would they act together? to find out we invited them all to one big party and joined in
#If I say that I love you#
#and you know it's true#
#if you said that you'd leave me#
#what would I do?#
#I'll let you back if you let me#
#I'll change your mind......#
Yes but they were a bit too tough for my liking so they hit me right in the back and I've still got a pain there
The posh ones,
"Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!" they're nuts you just have to touch them
Well some of them were rather dirty
- What do you think about them?
- I played with them quite naturally
I think they were rather nice really
What do you think about rich people?
Well... not much
Tell me about them
Well they think they can do everything without you doing it as well and they think just because they're rich they have to have people to do all their work
What would you do if you had lots of money, about two pounds?
Me? I would help the poor
What for?
The poor, if you don't help them they die soon wouldn't they and every time we have a harvest festival we send food to them and once these two.....no
Susan and Janet Simpson went round giving it out with Mr Floyd
- I don't think much of the accents
- Neither do I
Neither do I it won't prevent me liking them
Don't you ever think to yourself -
Jump out of that suit, come to the Eastend throw the books in the corner and do what you have to do
- I'd certainly throw the books in the corner
- Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yeah
- What are you going to do in life?
- I've really no idea
The idea of just living somewhere and working for a living is just horrifying really
I mean, being a student is very easy
I just postponed the decision by going to university
I wouldn't say being a student's easy, that's why I left school
- It was too hard
- Really
Who is to say what a seven year old child is?
I don't think there's anyway you can do it so a seven year old child could seem to be one thing and you could always argue that the end product was produced by what he actually was rather than what he seemed to be
- you'd normally use the total....
- Not a bookmaker but a....
- I'm always frightened they'd clear off
- What?
I'm always frightened they'd clear off if they had a bad afternoon
No they're not like that, they can always get hold of money
What fears do you have for the future?
Well certainly the idea of, as I was saying before getting into a job and simply getting stuck in it and that's it without knowing why you're doing it but I would think now that this is the time where I would think about something like that and make sure it doesn't happen
I really don't see how one's life can be a failure in that.... if I became a journalist and got sacked at thirty probably because I had grown out of it or I had changed so I was no longer suitable therefore I'd find something else which I enjoyed and which my talents were suited to
No I have never suffered at all never been driven to despair or tears or....
I don't know, have any of the others?
My strength is being able to keep going really and my weakness is not being able to take any positive course of action
I suppose I tend to behave in the fashion of the people that I'm with in some circumstances I think that can be quite a weakness sometimes sometimes wish I didn't occasionally look at myself and think "christ you're a bloody fool, what are you doing now?" and that sometimes disturbs me
We had a teacher at school that his favourite ploy was....
"All you girls want to do is walk out, get married, have babies and push a pram down the road with a cigarette hanging out the side of your mouth" god if there was ever a sentence
I'd resent it would be that one - yeah
There's only one ambition really I want a baby son if I see my baby son that'll be my ambition fulfilled no one knows that, only you now!
Well to me it is a dream to be totally happy
I mean, I don't think you can expect that but...
What happens if you don't make that?
If you don't ever find it? How will you cope?
I don't know, it would be hard to say the human minds very strong and it can be very weak and so you could crack up from it and you could just live your life out from day to day and you could get over it I think well not get over it but you'd sort of cope with it I think but what I'd do
I just don't know
I mean I want to be happy and my dreams are all for happiness but basically that's what
I want out of life
I always leave something inside me, I always leave a bit behind
I always hold back a bit with everything I do just to sort of....something to fall back on
I've always got something else to look on if anything goes wrong anywhere
What is that something you hold back?
I think it's a part of my heart
What do you want most out of life?
To be happy and get on with life you don't want to just sit back and let it always pass you could be run over by a bus tomorrow so you've got to make the most of it while you've got it
Simply to be able to wake up in the morning and feel that this day was going to be worthwhile which is what I don't feel at the moment
At the end of their very special day in London after their trip to the zoo and the party we took our children to an adventure playground where they could do just what they liked those from a children's home set about building a house
The houses in Australia, the average sort of living there will do me fine
I mean it's terrific
I often say I'm saving to settle down with Yvonne and then I think to myself "nah
I might buy a car instead"
There's Nicholas
You have to run fast to stay where you are to go forward you have to run very fast indeed, or whatever the quote is so I'll probably feel I'm actually achieving nothing and Tony
I don't want to change because if I change it proves the other Tony
Walker was all fake
Andrew
After I've qualified as a
Solicitor I'll have to rethink
I don't know at all what will happen after that and Bruce
It all springs from..... loving god and christ I suppose you try and do that as best as possible and that leads your actions in life
John
I'd quite like to go into politics but that's easier said than done
Susie
When you're a child you always think how nice it would be to be grown up and independent and things but there are times when
I wish I was three again
Jackie and her friends give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man this has been a glimpse of Britain's future

Ladies and gentlemen!
200 motels
200 motels . . . Life on the road!
Ladies and gentlemen! and here is . . .
Who?
Larry the dwarf!
Larry likes to dress up funny
Tonight he's dressed up like Frank Zappa
Let's ask him "What's the deal?"
Hi Larry, it's good to have you back on our panel.
Hi Dave, it's really great to be back on your panel.
I'm sure the people at home would be interested to know why such a large dwarf as you is all dressed up like Frank Zappa.
Tell us Larry, eh . . . what's the deal?
He made me do it, Dave. He's such a creep.
He's making me hold this alladin.
And why is he making you do that, Larry?
He wants me to fuck the girl with the harp.
He wants you to fuck the girl . . . with the harp?
No, no, with the magic lamp. He wants me to stuff it up her and rub it.
Hm. Hm-hm-hm. Ho-ho-ho, ha-ha. A-HA-HA-HA-HO-HO.
Let's ask our studio audience. If you'd just been lowered down here on TV by a wire connected to a brown leather harness, forced by a crazy person to insert a mysterious, imported lamp into the reproductive-rep-rep-rep into-into the rep-rep-reproductive orifice of a lady harpist and you were a dwarf . . . would you do it?
YES!!!
Yay!
Let's spin the big wheel, Larry! Go ahead, give it a whirl!
What our studio audience doesn't know is that the reason Larry the Dwarf is doing all this stuff is because its all part of the score to 200 Motels. Every word, every action, the lamp, the reproductive orifice, it's all in the score, so he has to do it. This whole event is a fantasy that occurred touring on the road. Touring can make you crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
That is precisely what 200 Motels is all about.
Say!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
How long?
How long?
Till that mystery roach be arrivin' soon
Ya-ooo Ya-ooo Ya-ooo Ya-ooo

What are we SINGING about?
We must be . . . FLIPPING OUT!
Special delivery for Mr. Volman! Mr. Volman?
Are you Volman?
It's a double cheeseburger from a famous American burger chain, with a symbol in the parking lot that's yellow plastic and goes like this:
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
. . . In a steaming briefcase!
You're Volman!
Yeh-No. No. He's Volman. Who are you?
You must call me "Rance Muhammitz."
"Rance Muhammitz"? Stupidest name I ever heard of.
Yah, but you must remember that within the conceptual framework of this filmic event, nothing really matters! It is entirely possible for several subjective realities to coexist. It is possible that all things are a deception of the senses.
Right on, Rance! The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake, artifical food coloring.
By the way. Mr. Volman, I have . . . YOUR CHEESEBURGER.
We must evolve.
Yeah . . .
We must progress.
Progress . . .
There must be growth!
Yeah . . . macrobiotic foods and tie-dye shirts!
Hey, ya ain't gonna eat that cheeseburger, Mark? . . . (BURP)
Fucking guy will eat anything.
This is registered delivery, you will have to sign for it.
Sure man, I'll sign. Where's the pencil?
I don't wish to alarm you, my son, but the signature will have to be . . . in blood.
Listen man, I just wanna know two things. Is there any beer in this fake nightclub, and when do we get paid?
Just-just a minute, just a minute, in a moment or two you'll be able to get your hands on all the imaginary beer that you want. For the moment, I would like to explain some of the things that you'll all be doing in this movie.
I've been wondering about that.
For Sherwood, we have a vacuum cleaner scheduled . . .
A vacuum cleaner?
. . . and a potential epileptic seizure during a production number later on.
A vacuum cleaner!
I thought the two of you would like to get acquainted.
It says here that you are supposed to be in love.
This abnormal relationship will be great for the big story I'm going to write!
Listen man, I just wanna know one thing: when do we get paid?
No look, look, look, look, look, don't you even care what you do?
So long as I get some beer and I get paid, you can make me do anything, I'm professional!
You should be careful talkin' about that stuff.
Why, does he listen?
He always listens. He always watches and listens to all the guys in the band. I've been in the band for years, and I know. He always listens.
That's how he gets all his material! It isn't s'posed to be natural, friendly, good-natured, humorous, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, YEAH, WELL FINE!
. . . and then he rips it off, and he sneaks off into a secret room someplace, and boils it in ammonia, and he gets it perverted, and THEN he brings it back to us at rehearsal and makes us play it!
Hey man, what's that over there?
It's HIM. You can see him, he's watching.
D'ya think he heard us?
I've been in the band for years. You can bet that he heard everything.
Yeah, let's go over and pretend to be nice to him.
Yeah, let's go over and pretent we don't know he's watching.
Yeah, and rippin' off all our good material.
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hey, Frank!
Hey, that's a GREAT new song you wrote, you know, the one about the penis and everything? I was laughin' a lot the whole time I was learnin' it!
Yeah, we were all laughin', Frank!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha YEAH, WELL FINE!
Yeah, it took a little while to get into it man, but once we got the drift, phew!
Yeah, there's lots of great parts you've got in there for the chorus, you know when they go:
RAN-TAN-RAN-TOON-RAN-TAN-TAN . . .
And I steal the room and everything, you know. I don't even mind you rippin' it off from me, just as long as I get paid.
Oh, and I don't even mind the part where he says, "what can I say about this fabulous elixir," so long as me and
Howard and Jeff Simmons who left the group just before the movie started get credit for special material! Ha-ha-ha!
I'm deeply offended by your lack of artistic sense.
Look here, Muhammitz, or whatever the fuck they call ya, I don't even give a shit man, I got five fuckin' kids at home and . . . can you lend me a coupla bucks until the end of the week? Who are you, anyway?
Oh, she writes for the Imaginary Rock and Roll newspaper in San Francisco.
San Francisco?
Man!
Oh! Eh, he's making me leave here now.
I'll see you later when we play.
What?
I don't expect you to understand that, because uh, we haven't formed the group yet.
Ah, Mark will play the bass . . .
Ba-doom-doom-doom-doom . . .
Howie will sing and play sax . . .
Dwee-dat-dwee-dat-dweet-dat-dwee-dat . . .
I'll play the guitar . . . woop-doo-doo-doo . . . and the dwarf here will play drums!
Waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit! This guy isn't even a dwarf!
That's one of the reasons the group will be so commercial!
Ah. What about the other guys?
Ah, they're already forming groups all over the place! Why wait till the end of the movie, we could have a hit single right now!
He's right, he's right! We don't need Aynsley . . .
No . . . We don't need Ian . . .
No . . . We don't need George!
No! We don't need anybody! Argh!
No!
He needs us, remember. We don't need him! All those other guys are too old for rock. They're out of it! We could have a tight little heavy little band with this dwarf here. You know, that he, he used to play drums for Leon Russell . . .
Ohh . . .
Listen, you're right. Zappa's 30.
Yeah, man.
Ohh . . . whew . . .
Thirty years old . . .
Oh, he's out of it man! He's too old, he should retire.
Yeah, really. You can't trust old people. You know, we should take up a collection and buy him a watch.
I don't know too much about this stuff
I've been a little busy
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
Just a few questions
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
I hear birds!
What's he saying?
You took the mystery burger! You are in full posession of
. . . the burger! Do you know who I am? Hm? Do you know
Who I really am?
Really man! WHO . . . DO YOU THINK . . . YOU ARE?
Yeah, do you want me to tell you WHO . . .
I really think you are?
Yeah, somebody tell me WHO is this guy?
Centerville
A real nice place to raise your kids up
Centerville
It's really neat!
Churches
Churches
And liquor stores
Oh, yeah! It's
Just like Glendale
Look!
Over there
It's a rancid boutique!
Janet, did you see those guys with the hair?
It's those guys from the fake stage across the street from our house.
Eww, I get so excited when someone from a group gets near me. I just . . . eww, I just . . .
Don't you have any taste? That one guy's got gray hair, and the other one's too fat.
Oh, they look so lonely.
Lonely? Good evening honey, they look desperate. Desperate pop stars are so depressing when they've been on the road for such a long time, and they finally get some action.
They drool on you.
Really. All that stuff that comes out of their mouth when they're on top of you. It's so moche. Ew.
Ew, on the pillows.
But I like the drummer with the rivets on his clothes, he's not bad.
Yeah, I've seen him too. He just screams
"Englishness," with that little haircut and the rings . . .
And the binoculars.
Binoculars?
Didn't you notice his binoculars?
No, he's got binoculars?
He watches us through them, he's a pervert!
Oh, I get so hot just thinking about perversions . . . Maybe when we go down to the fake nightclub tonight we can meet him, and find out if he really is perverted.
Just take my word for it; he is perverted.
Mmm. And English, too.
They're all that way.

OPAL, YOU HOT LITTLE BITCH!
Yes, Jimmy Carl Black, Indian of the Group, what can I do for you?
Mo-honnitz! What are you doin' here?
You just called me, didn't you?
All I said was "Opal, you hot little bitch".
I am known by many names.
Mm-hmm. You got many friends who call you
"Opal the hot little bitch"?
Please-please-please-please Mr. Black, let us cut the small talk, and get on with your briefing.
Fine, you can brief me all you want as long as you can tell me two things . . .
I know, when do we get paid . . .
No, I wanna know where's that waitress,
Yes, waitress..
And if she comes in this place, will she sit on my face, and loan me a couple bucks until the end of the week.

Uhhh, Tuesday was the 5th, uh Monday was the 3rd, uh make that out for Sunday-
Eh-eh-eh, don't say Sunday!
What's wrong with Sunday?
Eh!
The Lord's day! Br-r-r! A day of rest! Br-r-r! Just make that sucker out for the 23rd of March, wouldya?
Very well, Mr. Black. Oh, by the way. I have here the special beer I promised you earlier.
Oh man, it's about time, I've been waiting.
Would you care to sign for it?
This is a pencil?
No, Mr. Black, it is a pin.
A PIN?
Would you jab yourself in the finger with it?
Listen, Mo-hannitz, I may be professional, but I'm not THAT professional. I just want my beer.
Sign first! In blood.
Fuck you! Who do you think you are, the devil or something?
I am known by many names.
You probably got some more weird names for yourself, but I'll tell you one thing you ain't nev-, definitely ain't never gonna be called and that's the devil, because you ain't the devil.
Oh, I'm not?
You bet your sweet ass you're not. The fuckin' devil's got an english accent.
I seen him three weeks ago on TV. So you know, you can just take this big needle here and hang it in your ass as far as I'm concerned! (cough) Fuckin' guy musta been a communist!
Hello there. When you go on tour with a musical group, it's possible that any town can seem like this.
Whether it's large or small, or busy, or if there's nothing happening in it.
The reason for this is quite simple. A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent god-fearing citizen, and the life he leads, in many ways, seems useless and irrelevant to those of us who'd prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer. Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people. Many of them study for years, learning to play the violin for instance, only to be rewarded with a humdrum job in the fourth row of a symphonic string section.
That's why the governments have constructed, at great expense, this experimental reorientation facility.
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless old musicians with their brown fiddles and little horns.
Give them a trade! A reason to exist in the modern world! A chance of a happier, more productive life.
Some will enter the military, some will learn shorthand, and some will disappear in the middle of the night on a special train they're sending in.
It's the only way, really, to bring about the final solution to the orchestra question.
I'm sure that many of us realize that a pop group can earn a vast amount of money compared to these other kinds of musicians. That's why the special government agencies for mass response programming and psychological stultification prefer to treat them in a more subtle manner.
They know, just as many of you vigilant and thoroughly upstanding citizens have discovered for yourselves, the power of pop music to corrupt and putrify the minds of world youth are virtually limitless.
Ooh, the way you love me, lady,
I get so hard now I could die
Ooh, the way you love me, sugar,

Oh, no, no, it wouldn't be right
For me to tell you tonight
You better tell me right away

Don't get mad
It ain't no big thing
You better tell me right away,
Don't you treat me cold

Well, there are a lot of reasons why I'd . . . I'd drag a girl such as yourself back to this . . . plastic hotel room and . . . rip you off for spare change to run a

They're driving me crazy.
Hey, look what's comin' through the door!

Ah, it's really great now . . . more paper, more paper . . . page two..

Yes! Oh, show me a little ass! Oh, scuze me

No no no!
Man! This stuff is great! It's just as if Donovan himself had appeared on my very own TV with words of peace, love, and eternal cosmic wisdom . . . ! Leading me. Guiding me. On paths of everlasting pseudo-karmic negligence, in the very midst of my drug-induced nocturnal emission.
For I am your good conscience, Jeff. I know all. I see all. I am a cosmic love pulse matrix, becoming a technicolor interpositive!
Huh? Where'd you buy that incense? It's hip.
It's the same and mysterious exotic oriental fragrance as what the Beatles get off on.
I thought I recognized it . . . Sniff, sniff . . . Mmm, what is that, MUSK? Sniff, sniff, sniff . . . mmmh!
Jeff, I know what's good for you.
Right. You're heavy.
Yes, Jeff, I am your guiding light. Listen to me.
Don't rip off the towels, Jeff!
Piss off, you little nitwit!
Hey man, what's the deal?
Don't listen to him, Jeff, he's no good. He'll make you do BAD THINGS!
You mean, he'll make me sin?
Yes, Jeff. SIN!
Wow!
Jeff, I'd like to have a word with you . . . about your soul.
No, don't listen, Jeff.
Why are you wasting your life, night after night playing this comedy music?
You're right, I'm too heavy to be in this group.
Comedy music . . .
Jeff, YOUR SOUL!
Oh, ah Oh, you're wasting your life
To be . . .
Ah Oh, ah Ah, ah
Too heavy, Jeff
In this group, all I ever get to do is play Zappa's comedy music. HE EATS!
Jeff!
I get so tense!
Of course you do, my boy.
The stuff he makes me do is always off the wall!
That's why it would be best to leave his stern employ.
And quit the group!
You'll make it big!
That's right.
Of course!
And then I won't be SMALL!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ti-diddly-diddly-dee
Ha, ha, ha . . .
He-he-he-he-heh!
Cough, cough. Ahmet Ertegun used this towel as a bathmat six weeks ago at a rancid motel in Orlando, Florida, with the highest MILDEW rating of any commercial lodging facility within the territorial limits of the United States, naturally excluding tropical possessions . . . It's still damp. What an aroma! This is the best I ever got off! What can I say about this elixir?
This is the real you, Jeff. Rip off a few more ashtrays. Get rid of some of that inner tension. Quit the comedy group!
Get your own group together. Heavy! Like GRAND FUNK! Or BLACK SABBATH . . .
No, Jeff . . .
Or COVEN!
Peace . . . Love . . .
Bollocks!
What can I say about this elixir?
What?
WOWWWWWW!
What can I?
WOWWWWWW!
What?
What can I say about this?
WOWWWWWW!

Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the French Riviera at the MIDEM convention. A fake tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and customized by Rantoon
Tan, Hantoon Frammin, and DEE . . .
Followed by twelve potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice, with your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner office, and Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets on Air Rangoon.
Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a fake rock and roll guitar player in a comedy group?

I'm going to die. I know I'm going to die, I can tell because my pulse is so weak. The pills . . . I took so many downers that I know this is the end for me.
You poor thing. You want us to fix your hair for you so you look good when they find you?
Oh . . . would you?
Sure, whaddyawant? A ponytail? A flat-top with fenders?
I'm gonna die, Janet, I'm gonna O.D.! So, make me look good.
Listen, the best I can do for you is fix your hair, so why don't you get up and wash that melted eye makeup off your face.
Is it smeared? I've been crying so much . . . it's so damn sad when you know you'll never see all your friends anymore.
Every week it's the same old thing. You're gonna die. You're gonna die. Somebody went out on you. Somebody doesn't love you anymore. How long you been a groupie? You should get used to romances which are so obviously cheap. Listen, just in case you crash out, and the imaginary rock and roll newspaper from San Francisco wants to get any pictures of you, you'll look like you washed your face. Really.
It's better this way with a clean face.
People think groupies are such dirty girls.
Heh . . . I wouldn't mind sort of fucking all three of them!
Look, over there!
What?
He's doing it, he's watching us from the fake bandstand with the binoculars!
Who, the English dude?
Oh, rivet-boy!
The rivet boy? Where?
Over there, wipe that stuff out of your eyes.
It looks like he's beating off.
Beating off? I knew he was a pervert.
Eww, how exciting. Hey, are you still trying to O.D.?
Yes, this definitely is the end for me!
I feel so faint! So weak!
Good evening honey, that was the most imaginary collapse I've seen since last week.
Janet, do you think she's going to die?
Are you kidding? Did you see her hit the floor?
God, well it was so obviously cheap. Lift up your head, honey.
I'm going to die. This time it's real.
Listen, Lucy, we gotta get ready for our big dance number, we're going to the fake nightclub tonight.
Everything's getting dim.
Why don't you tell her a story while you put your makeup on? Good evening.
Oh. Listen, toots. I'm going to make up a nice little fairy tale for you.
The pills, the Mandrax, I took so many of them.
I'll tell you part of the story, and then you make up another part that goes along with it. Once upon a time there was a tall, handsome, muscular . . .
Dwarf.
. . . with a very special . . .
Swedish apparatus!
. . . that him and his friends would use in c onjunction with . . .
Bold new surgical experiments!
. . . involving . . .
A bludgeon, and a bottle of champagne . . .
. . . and a . . .
. . . microwave oven . . .
. . . from a . . .
. . . jumbo jet, one of the big jobs leased from
Air Rangoon!
. . . which, when used correctly . . .
. . . can effectively increase the dimensions . . .
. . . and firepower of your . . .
. . . dick . . .
. . . to the point where . . .
. . . in some instances, it should be classified as a lethal weapon!
Your dick!
Your dick?
Your dork!
Your dork?
Your prick!
Your prick?
Your pork!
Your pork?
Your pork?
Who calls it a pork? These men, and the stuff they call a wee-wee!
A wee-wee?
You mean a penis, don't you?
A penis?
Penis is such an ugly word.
It's not that ugly, really.
Sure, I-I use it all the time.
Sure, sure, we all say it every once in a while. Listen:
PENIS.
Ewww!
Penis! Penis!
Ew, it sounds so revolting the way you guys say it. Ew, ka-ka.
Ka-ka!
The penis can be a very useful organ.
Yeah, and very exciting, too, once you get to know me.
Oh, yeah, right, yeah, etc . . .
Penis!
It sounds so overwhelmingly medicinal.
A penis sounds like something a doctor would have hanging off of him.
None of the men I know and love in the rock and roll business got penises. They all got cocks or dicks at least.
Sure, you want to go strap on a pop star, and he wants to stick a penis up you, where is that at?
Let's ask our studio audience!
Will you trade what he has in his pants for what I have behind this curtain?
What is it?
You mean what's in his pants?
I know what's in his pants, he's a lonely guy.
You have to choose before the big wheel stops whirling. You! Hey, buddy! Sky marshall! Go whirl the big wheel!
Can I just take the money?
There isn't any money, just the curtain and . . .
. . . the lonely guy.
Time is running out, think it over carefully.
The curtain!
I want the money.
Wait! What could it be in there?
In his pants?
In the curtain!
Doesn't anybody care what's in my pants?
Penis dimension
Penis dimension
Penis dimension is worrying me
I can't hardly sleep at night
'Cause of penis dimension
Do you worry?
Do you worry a lot?
No!
Do you worry?
Do you worry and moan . . .
That the size of your cock is not monstrous enough?
It's your penis dimension!
Penis dimension!
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Hiya friends. Now just be honest about it. Did you ever consider the possiblity that your penis, and in the case of many dignified ladies, that the size of the titties themselves might provide elements of sub-conscious tension? Weird, twisted anxieties that could force a human being to have to become a politician!
A policeman!
A Jesuit monk
A rock and roll guitar player! A wino! You name it. Or in the case of the ladies, the ones that can't afford a silicone
BEEF-UP, they become writers of hot books
"Manuel, the gardener, placed his burning phallus in her quivering quim."
Yes, or they become Carmelite nuns!
"Gonzo, the lead guitar player, placed his mutated member in her slithering slit." Ha ha ha! Ooh . . .
Or race horse jockeys. There is no reason why you or your loved ones should suffer. Things are bad enough, without the size of your organ adding even more misery to the TROUBLES OF THE WORLD!
Right on, right on!
Now, if you're a lady and you've got munchkin tits, you can console yourself with this age-old line from primary school:
ANYTHING OVER A MOUTHFUL IS WASTED! YES!
And isn't it the truth? And if you're a guy, and one night you're at a party and you're trying to be cool, I mean, you aren't even wearing any underwear, you're being so cool, and somebody hits on you one night, and he looks you up and down and he says, uh . . .
Eight inches or less?
Well let me tell you, brothers, that's the time when you've got to turn around and look that sonofabitch right between the eyes, and you got to tell him these words:
I stuff three pair of socks and a bar of beauty soap down in front of my pants!

Out of the shower, she squeezes her spots;
Brushes her teeth;
Shoots a deodorant spray up her twat . . .
(It's getting her, getting her
Hot--Oh-woh-woh-woh-woh-woh)
She's just twenty-four
And she can't get off,
A sad but typical case, yeah
Last dude to do her
Got in and got soft;
She blew it,
And laughed in his face, yeah!
Face, yeah!
Yeah
She chooses all the clothes
She'll wear tonight to dance in!
The places that she goes
Are filled with guys from groups,
Waiting for a chance to break her pants in
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!

Well, at least there's sort of a choice there;
Twenty or thirty at times there have been--
Somewhat desirable boys there--
Dressed really spiffy, with long hair--
Waiting for girls they can shove it right in

Hello there. All the guys in the band are pretending to get ready so they can go out and find some pussy.
Oh, I wonder where the action is in this town?
Every musician likes to find some pussy.
Boy, I coulda really scored last night. But every night its the same thing; Aynsley gets there first. He's so FAST . . . it must be from playing the drums or something. I mean . . . if those girls over there only knew my secret identity, but
. . . but how COULD they? How- how could they know that I am Bwana Dik?
Where's my hair dryer? Got to look lovely for the girls. After all, I am Bwana Dik.
Each guy has his own speciality for getting the girl of his dreams.
I sprayed my pits . . . I put on a new tie-dye t-shirt . . . I brushed my teeth . . .
I cleaned my glasses . . .
I buffed my nails.
I bought a copy of Down Beat so I could carry it around and look like I knew what was happening.
I left my shirt unbuttoned at the top . . .
I just KNOW I'm gonna get laid tonight. I'm not taking any chances. I got this little jar of tinsel glitter here . . . the same brand Danny Hutton puts on his face that makes him look all . . . glistening and seductive. Just put a little on here . . . the cheeks . . . the chin . . . mmm, the quivering lips . . . I'm so commercial I could die! Somebody . . .
TURN ON A BLUE SPOTLIGHT!!!
What will this morning bring me this evening?
Some local hot action
Before we are leaving (maybe we can get some head)
Go to the club or the bar or wherever the pussy is found
In the town your band is booked to play in
It's always a little bit harder to score
If it's just your first time in a town you never hit before
If you stayed in it once and got laid
You've got it made, ahhh, got it made
If it's just your first time
Then you know it's no fun to go
Back to a plastic hotel all alone
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Or wherever the pussy is found
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
She's such a dignified lady
She's so pretty and soft
You can't call her a groupie
It just pisses her off
She got diamonds and jewelry
She got lotsa new clothes
She ain't hurtin' for money
So that everyone knows
That she knows what she wants
Knows what she likes
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . she's got her eyes on you
She left her place after midnight
And she drove to the club
You know that her and her partner
Came here lookin' for love
They want a guy from a group
Got a thing in a charts
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
They will give him their hearts
'Cause they know what they want
And they know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . they got their eyes on you
FAM-BAM-YAK-A-TA-TAHHH!
They know what they want
Know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy

Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Chevy!

['Cause they're dancin'!]
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo . . .
Oh wow, what a night. What's the matter, didn't you get any action tonight?
Didn't you used to be with the Mothers?
Yeah.
Is this what you do now?
I've got my own group, too. I don't mind being in this movie. I get a chance to transform a few times, drink these vile, foamy liquids.
Bleagh.
What kind of a life is that?
It's not that bad! Really! I LIKE to be a monster every once in awhile!
No one will ever take you seriously after this.
Why, because I transform? I LIKE to be a monster!
There's a little monster in every one of us.
You'll probably stay here for the rest of your life with your fake potions and your twisted monster face. You coulda
BEEN something in rock and roll.
I TRIED to get a hit single. It drove me to drink.
Ugh.
Hoo-hoo-ha-ha . . .
Go on, laugh about it. You could have been a star. You could have spread your aura across vast continental areas, your name on millions of small, hot lips, whispering under secure, pink blankets in the lonely midnight dark. But whaddya do? Ya join the Mothers, and ya end up working for Zappa, and he makes you be a creep! You coulda played the blues with John Mayall, or far-out exciting jazz with Blood Sweat and Tears.
You really think so?
Look. No one will ever take you seriously after this. How can they take you seriously? In this business you've either got to play the blues or sing with a high voice.
You're right. I never should have joined the Mothers. Why, I could be a star now! Oh, when I think of all those millions of . . .
Hey.
Hot pink juicy little . . .
Hey. Listen, do you know where I can uh, get any dope in this imaginary town?
Man, there's no dope in this town. Just these vile, foamy liquids.
Well, they're fake aren't they?
No, they're real! I mix them myself at home, and then I bring them in the morning . . . secret spiritual formulas . . .
Ew, what's a secret spiritual formula?
The stuff that goes in the elixir, the potion, whatever
I mix is irrelevant to the result.
You mean they're fake potions, right?
Look, it doesn't matter what's in the mix. It's the liquid! The concept . . . of the liquid . . . is enough to trigger a special cosmic state. Its because I'm so spiritually evolved . . .
Oh, listen, I just wanna get out of it, and go back to me fake motel room and play the blues, you know. Fuck your spiritual evolvement. Anyway, what happens if a new and exciting blues talent such as meself drinks your stuff?
Here. Take this back to your fake room.
Drink it.
I'd feel a lot happier if there was something I could smoke.
Well, here. Dip this in it. Now, let it dry out. That ought to get you a little HIGH. Or something.
Ew, I can't take you seriously.
Look, you might as well take this too.
I know its only fake potion. Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues.
Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks?
White people can play the blues, you know.
Hello. Frank. Yeah, I gave it to him.
Yeah, he went back to the special room.
No, no. He's gonna smoke it. Yeah, right.
Hey, listen. You got any idea when we're gonna get paid for this?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
A succulent fat one
A mod little flat one
Maybe a hot one (to give me the clap!)
Maybe a freak who gets off with a strap
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues. Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? White people can play the blues, you know. Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? Why not some extended blues licks?
Yeah, I gave it to him. Yeah, he went back to the special room. No, no. He's gonna smoke it.
Jeff has gone out there on that stuff!
He should have never have used the elixir and only stuck to the incense. Oh, Atlantis . . .
That was BILLY THE MOUNTAIN, dressed up like Donovan, fading out on the wall-mounted TV screen. Jeff IS flipping out. Road fatigue! We've got to get him back to normal before Zappa finds out, and steals it, and makes him do it in the movie!
You have a brilliant career ahead of you, my boy,
Just GET OUT OF THIS GROUP!
Howard, that was Studebacher Hoch, dressed up like Jim Pons, giving career guidance to the bass player of a rock-oriented comedy group. Jeff's imagination has gone beyond the fringe of audience comprehension.
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, the Phlorescent Leech!
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, Eddie!
I'm stealing the towels! Ha ha . . . ha ha . . .
Stealing the room
Stealing the . . . Stealing the room
I'm  I'm
Stealing  Stealing
I'm  I'm  Stealing
This, as you might have gathered, is the end of the movie. The entire cast is assembled here at the Centerville
Recreational Facility to bid farewell to you, and to express thanks for your attendance at this theater.
This might seem old fashioned to some of you, but I'd like to join in on this song.
It's the kind of a sentimental song that you get at the end of a movie, , it's the kind of a song that people might sing to let you in the audience know that we really like you and care about you, yeah . . .
Understand how hard it is to laugh these days, with all the terrible problems in the world!
Lord, have mercy on the people in England
For the terrible food these people must eat
And may the Lord have mercy on the fate of this movie
And God bless the mind of the man in the street
Help all the rednecks and the flatfoot policemen
On the terrible functions they all must perform
God help the winos, the junkies, and the weirdos
And every poor soul who's adrift in the storm.
Help everybody, so they all get some action
Some love on the weekend, some real satisfaction
A room and a meal
And a garbage disposal
A lawn and a hose'll
Be strictly genteel
Lord, have mercy on the hippies and faggots
And the dykes and the weird little children they grow
Help the black man
Help the poor man
Help the milk man
Help the door man
Help the lonely, neglected old farts that I know
Well, it certainly has been swell . . .
If your name wasn't on the list of blessings we've been passing out tonight, we don't want you to be pissed off.
No . . .
We don't want you to leave that theater.
Forgive him, for he knows not what he does.
But before we go on, I'd like to introduce to you . . .
On the other hand, maybe he does know . . .
. . . my good friend and musical associate, Mr. Howard Kaylan who's about to give us a closing final benediction.
They're gonna clear out the studio
They're gonna tear down all the . . .
They're gonna whip down all the . . .
They're gonna sweep out all the . . .
They're gonna pay off all the . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
Hey hey hey, everybody in the orchestra and the chorus
Talkin' 'bout every one of our lovely and talented dancers
Talkin' 'bout the light bulb men
Camera men
The make-up men
Yeah, the rake-up men
They're all gonna rise up
They're gonna jump up
I said jump up
Talkin' 'bout jump right up and off the floor
Jump right up and hit the door
They're all gonna rise up and jump off!
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
And once again
Take themselves
Seriously, yeeeah!
Two, three, four, seriously
They're all gonna go home (ye-hey!)
Through the driving sleet and rain
They're all gonna go home
Through the fog, through the dust
Through the tropical fever and the blistering frost
They're all gonna go home
And get out of it as they can be, baby
And the same goes for me
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
And each and every member of this rock oriented comedy group in his own special way
Is gonna get out of it as he can be
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
And I am definitely gonna get . . .
REAMED
'Cause I'm such a lonely
I'm such a lonely
A lonely, lonely, talkin' 'bout a lonely guy!
Oh, and I know tonight, I am definitely . . .
I am positively . . .
I just have to get . . .
BENT, REAMED AND WASTED
A disaster area the size of Atlantic City, New Jersey!
He's making me do this, ladies and gentlemen. I wouldn't do it if it weren't for him. You noticed, all through this material, I've been glancing over toward my left? Well, I'll tell you the reason for that, ladies and gentlemen. HE is over there. HE is over on the left. HE is the guy that is making me do all this shit. Right over there.
Now all through this movie, every time we've been on stage, I've had to look over in that direction, right?
You saw it . . . you know. Well that's 'cause HE's over there. I've got to watch him for signs.
He jumps up and down like a jackass. I can't even believe the guy sometimes.
But we gotta watch him. "After all," we said,
"it's Frank's movie."
Now, we're THE MOTHERS, but it's still Frank's movie.
Let's say it, he got to paid for it, he rented the studio, had all these cheesy sets built . . .
It's so moche! I can't even stand it . . .
He's telling everybody, right now, right over there, to . . .

[Mrs. Beale]
What are you doing down there?
Just standing there?
- [David Maysles]
Just filming the main room.
- [Edie] Whiskers!
[Mrs. Beale]
Well, did you know that
Whiskers has disappeared?
- A cat got out.
I'm trying to get him in.
- [David] Has he? Ah.
Yeah, we don't know how he got out.
I think he got out in that hole there.
- No, I knew they were coming, and I...
- I think he got out in that hole.
- He can jump up there.
- I knew they were coming and...
Yeah. No, he got out in that hole, Edie.
I put them all out.
You told me to.
No, dearie, he got out in the hole, babe.
"Take the cats out,"you said.
- Did you hear what I said, woman?
- What?
He got out in this hole here.
That was the noise we heard.
That raccoon did that to my new wall.
Isn't that terrible?
They'll have the whole house
down soon.
[Edie]
Yeah, we'll be raided again.
We'll be raided again
by the village of East Hampton.
You know, they can get you
in East Hampton for wearing
red shoes on a Thursday...
and all that sort of thing.
I don't know whether you know that.
I mean, do you know that?
They can get you
for almost anything.
- [Edie] It's the Maysles!
- [Albert Maysles] Hi, Edie.
- [David] The gentlemen callers.
- I saw your car.
- One of my cats just got out.
- Edie, you look fantastic.
David, you look absolutely terrific. Honestly.
You've got light...
You've got light blue on.
Well, Al, you're still...
Mother says you're very conservative.
[Laughs]
Brooks, everything looks wonderful.
- Thank you.
- Absolutely wonderful.
This is the best thing to wear for the day. You understand.
- Yeah.
- Because I don't like women in skirts, and the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants... under a short skirt, I think.
Then you have the pants under the skirt, and then you can pull the stockings up over the pants, underneath the skirt.
- Uh-huh.
- And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape.
So I think this is the best costume for the day.
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
I have to think these things up, you know.
Mother wanted me to come out in a kimono, so we had quite a fight.
So what did you do, photograph Brooks cutting right down here?
- Yeah, I've been through the jungle.
- Oh, for goodness sakes.
What do you want to do now?
Where do you want to go? Upstairs?
Do you want to go up and photograph it from the top porch?
- Okay.
- Okay.
They're gonna photograph from the top now, Brooks.
[David]
It's a beautiful garden back here.
Did you see the wall garden?
- Oh, you mean the patio.
You mean this.
- Yeah.
That's a Spanish wall garden
over there, you know.
- Oh, yes.
- The Hills put that in.
They imported
everything from Rome.
Mrs. Hill, she was a famous horticulturist.
That was one of the famous gardens of America.
Brooks, next summer,
if we're all living,
I think a vegetable garden
would be a good thing in here.
You don't get enough sunlight in here.
Yeah, Mother says she doesn't mind
if you have to cut down some privet
for the garden.
- Would be nice.
- Yeah.
Because food's going up.
We heard that on the radio last night.
Do you think my costume
looked all right for Brooks?
I think he was a little amazed.
- He's probably seen it before.
- No, no. This is the revolutionary costume.
I never wear this in East Hampton.
[David] He seems okay.
He seems like he can handle it.
[Edie]
You can't be too careful.
Know what I mean?
That was the original living room.
You know, people go back to a kitchen now.
Though the washing machine was always put in the maids' dining room.
You know, the washtubs are in the maids' dining room.
- Let's go up.
- It's very difficult... to keep the line between the past and the present.
Do you know what I mean?
It's awfully difficult.
[Mrs. Beale] That is
a beautiful ocean today, isn't it?
What color would you say
that was? Sort of sapphire?
I've never seen
anything like that ocean.
The 50 years I've been here...
the best in 50 years.
Oh, Edie, are you around?
- Oh, Edie!
- I haven't been out of this
goddamn horrible place... in two years.
God, if you knew how I felt.
I'm ready to kill.
Well, they're not going
to take you to the beach.
- Brooks wants his... his check, Mother darling.
- All right, give me the...
- He's at the door.
- I told you I should do it now.
Twenty-four bucks for three cuttings.
Just a minute.
I told you...
Better bring the pen.
I locked all the cats away.
- [Cats Meowing]
- Don't be so mean.
They don't wanna be locked away.
The poor little kitties.
You know kitties adore sun.
I suppose I won't get out of here till she dies or I die.
- Who's she? The cat?
- I don't know when
I'm gonna get out of here.
- Why do you want to get out?
Another place'd be much worse.
- 'Cause I don't like it.
- Any place will be much worse.
- Here.
- Any place on earth.
- Yeah, but I like freedom.
Well, you can't get it, darling.
You're being supported.
- You can't get any freedom when you're being supported.
- Yeah, but...
- You can't?
- No, you can't.
- I think you're not free when you're not being supported.
- You have to toe the mark.
- It's awful both ways.
- Well, you don't look it.
You look very young
for 56 years of age.
Don't you remember
what you told me...
- I'd just like a couple of days on the beach, that's all.
- What was it you told me?
- Twenty-four bucks.
- You don't have to scream that out.
When are you gonna learn, Edie?
You're in this world, you know.
You're not out of the world.
[Edie Sighs]
Let's see if I can remember the date.
Is it the 12th today?
- Well, there are certain
compensations, I guess.
- Is it the 12th today?
The old woman, she has to remember everything, you know that.
I think this is correct.
Brooks Hiers. H-I-E-R-S.
- Oh, I didn't think it was necessary.
- Yes.
Why didn't you let me do this in the house for?
Why did you make me do it here?
Mother, you don't have
enough clothes on.
Well, I hope... I'm gonna get naked in just a minute, so you better watch out.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Yeah, for what? Now, why?
- I haven't got any warts on me.
- But the movie, the movie.
- I haven't got any warts on me.
- That isn't the point, Mother darling.
Well, you know where you got,
being like that.
No husband, no babies, nothing.
I can't help it.
I like to wear certain things.
- Is that H-Y-E-R? H-Y?
- She likes everything without girdles.
- H- Y, Edie, or H-I?
- H-Y-E-R-S.
- H-Y?
- Yeah.
She and Marjorie don't believe in wearing girdles.
I haven't worn a girdle since I was 12 years old.
- Here you are.
- Mother has certain ideas about, uh...
- I certainly have certain ideas about living a long time.
- About clothes.
- That's what I got ideas about.
- [Door Closes]
It's very hard to live nowadays.
Living is very difficult.
"The Libra husband is not an easy man to please.
"The monotony of domesticity is not to his liking, but he is a passionate man and a respecter of tradition."
All I have to do is find this Libra man.
"The Libra husband is reasonable.
"He is a born judge,
"and no other zodiacal type...
"can... order his life... with so much wisdom."
My God!
That's all I need... order.
That's all I need... an ordered life.
You know, a manager.
But he's got to be a Libran.
[Man]
Hello.
Yeah?
- That sounds like Jerry.
- Oh, is that Jerry?
For goodness sakes.
- [Edie Laughing]
- What are you doing?
Jerry, you're
Aquarius, aren't you?
That's what I saw
when I met you, Jerry.
- Remember I said the Marble Faun,
and it was terrible.
- Yeah.
Terrible, the tragedy connected with the Marble Faun.
- You know, I call Jerry
"the Marble Faun."
- Nathaniel Hawthorne.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Do you have that book here, Edie?
I haven't been able
to find it.
If you run across it,
I'd like to read it.
It's very deep. I don't know whether
you... Well, I guess you're up to it.
They used to have it on all the, uh...
I think it was on the high school reading list. The Marble Faun.
"The Libra husband
does not seek divorce...
"unless the conditions of his life... are not adjustable."
I don't believe in divorce at all.
- I think divorce...
- Was your mother divorced or no?
- No.
- Separated.
Yes, and then my father got a, got a fake Mexican divorce, and he... did have, you know, what he called another wife.
But we didn't recognize it. It wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church.
They don't recognize it, you know.
Say, are you bossing me around, Edie?
All afternoon?
- [Edie] I think that's terrific.
- Oh, Edie, it's not the best one.
This is the worst one
of my wedding pictures.
The others look worse.
I was gonna be a singer, you know.
A professional singer.
When I met Mr. Beale,
the jig was up.
Do you remember this?
- May I see that, please?
- The villain of the piece.
"To my best friend and most delightful comrade,
"to my only sweetheart
and wonderful wife,
"I tender this likeness
of her husband.
Phelan Beale, 1929. "
- So we did love each other.
- Did I laugh when I read that.
Aren't kids terrible?
I just roared.
When the people don't speak,
they never get divorced.
- You just can't tell.
- I've been a very happy woman
all my life.
Shall I tell them about Gould?
Gould was Mother's accompanist.
He was a boogie-woogie composer
who had the most terrific style.
He was the most brilliant man
I've ever met.
That's including Mr. Beale
and Mr. Bouvier.
Completely brilliant.
This is cute, Mother.
I like that very much.
Don't you, David?
You said Michelle Beale stole this, didn't you, Edie?
I never did.
She'd never do that.
See how fat I was, Edie?
Did I look like a good mother?
Was I a good mother?
- [David] It looks like it.
- What? Looks like it.
I didn't starve my children, did I? What?
Fed 'em. Fed 'em well.
[Mrs. Beale]
They were very nice children.
I enjoyed them tremendously.
I'm crazy about my two sons,
absolutely mad about them.
- [David] Who's the little girl?
- [Edie] That's me.
[Mrs. Beale] Well, the boys were,
were not hard to handle at all.
- They were very easy to handle.
- Oh, my mother never saw my brothers.
I saw them every minute,
every single minute.
- Oh, they never got
any discipline, my brothers.
- They didn't need it.
- They were absolutely perfect.
- They never got any discipline.
This was taken with a tiny
little Kodak Number Two.
That was. Kodak Number Two.
Cost two dollars, that camera.
- Mother, I'm mad about these pictures of you.
- Oh, no, don't take those.
- We'll just put them right over here.
- Oh, no, I want those out.
- Will you give me those, please?
- No, you can't have them.
I want them, Edie.
I will never see them again.
Now, I want those pictures.
- I want those pictures, Edie.
- You can't expose them
to the light in here.
No, give me those pictures.
I don't want to ask 67 times.
- Come on.
- I want to show that to Al.
- No, I want...
- I wanna show it to Al!
- It's my picture.
- Look what you made me do.
Well, you did it.
Look what she did.
- Mrs. Beale had a classical face.
I want you to see this.
- Look at what she did.
- Look. Very few people have this.
- Don't touch that!
Al, I want you to see this.
- [Edith Laughing]
- Now look, this is my mother.
This British blood,
maybe Jewish, I don't know.
In the Leaman family,
I'm not sure.
- I don't want that photographed.
- Scotch blood... the Ewings.
- Imagine showing those horrible things
I don't want you to show.
- The Ewing clan's in there.
But it's just a girl
from a good French family.
It's a very beautiful face.
[Mrs. Beale]
I lived alone at least 30 years.
L- I didn't mind.
You get very independent when you live alone.
You get to be a real individual.
- You can't have your cake and eat it too in life.
- Oh, yes, I did.
I did. I had my cake, loved it,
masticated it, chewed it...
- and had everything I wanted.
- You can't have your cake
and eat it too.
I had a very, very happy, satisfying life.
Well, you had a rich husband
You should have stayed with him.
- Now you might as well face it.
- What! For money?
- She was bored.
- Why, I was not. I was a great singer.
I had a perfect marriage,
beautiful children.
Terribly successful marriage.
Never had a fight in my life.
- I never threw anything
at Mr. Beale. Never.
- [Laughing]
They threw the bull around, as they say.
No, I never had any words with Mr. Beale at all.
I came down here to live in this, in this house because I did all my singing here.
I was so happy. I was happier going out and singing... than anything I've ever done since I was born.
I liked it better than anything I ever did.
- I can't find it, Mother.
- Well, you could let me help you.
- Let me...
- Listen, kid.
I'm extremely organized.
I know exactly where to look for this stuff.
I've got it under control right here, but I can't find it.
Get it?
Well, bring in the...
bring in the orchestration...
of"Tea for Two."
I can't do it.
My feet hurt.
Just try, babe.
They're beautiful.
I have to get my voice exactly back the way it was when I was 45 years old.
- You can't, Mother darling.
- Oh, yes, I can. Oh, yes!
- Something happens, face it.
- I never strained my voice ever in my life.
- Oh, but I strain my voice
from yelling and screaming.
- I've never smoked cigarettes.
- What is the matter with me?
I could never speak again.
- Oh, no.
Why, I can get it back
in about a month, just about.
You know, good hard work.

You were able to save

Well, now you see why you lived, because you had music all the time.
That's why.
And you went to the beach too.

"How many times do I have to try?"
Why, it may be a good many times.
For example, I have in my pocket here
a letter from a man in London, England.
"Dear Dr. Peale,
Over three years ago...
"I was in your great Marble
Collegiate Church for the first time...
"and I was having it rough.

- "The job I'd been doing
had come to an end, and I was 55.

"I did think. I did work very hard to find a job.
Eighty-eight interviews."
So did he or did he not get the job?
He did.
Will he or will not handle himself...
in the years that are to come?
He wasn't emotional.
He didn't get upset.
- He wasn't nervous.
- He wasn't me.
He was cool.
Now one thing is sure:
The human mind will not function
when it is hot.
- Only when it is cool and dispassionate...
- Dispassionate.
- That was the word
I wanted to other day.

I couldn't think of what it was.
I think it would be a good idea if every day every individual...
would look at himself

earnestly,
and ask the question,
"Who am I?
Am I a weak person?

You have to.

And my hair will grow...

[David]
You're dressed for battle, Edie.
Mother's telling Marjorie how spoiled I am, how terrible I am.
And Marjorie knew my father and my uncle and everybody.
Mother's giving her all this S-H-I-T, so I went and told her some things about the family.
But, you see, in dealing with me... the relatives didn't know... that they were dealing with a staunch character.
And I tell you, if there's anything worse than a staunch woman...
S-T-A-U-N-C-H.
There's nothing worse,
I'm telling you.
[Sighs]
They don't weaken... no matter what.
But they didn't know that.
Well, how were they to know?
You know, my father had made up his mind about what Farmington produced... and what the
Sacred Heart Convent produced.
I don't think he was so down on the Spence School, but he certainly was down on Farmington.
I don't know why.
Farmington was a junior college.
You could choose what you wanted to study.
Perhaps that was what made my father dislike it so... that I could choose.
But I chose what I thought he'd want me to choose... you know,
English literature and...
Oriental philosophies and, uh... well, I always took French, but nothing ever happened there.
I can read and write in French, but I can't speak it.
I had years and years and years of French.
Terrible.
[Laughs]
This was taken by Amy Dupont
at my last year in Farmington.
I was 17.
- [David] Edie, that's so beautiful.
- Mr. Wainwright did that.
He was an artist from a very good
family. He was in the social register.
He did it in the solarium
of Grey Gardens.
David, look at this.
I was in a fashion show.
- [Laughs]
- [Mrs. Beale] Let me see that.
[Albert]
Oh, beautiful. Look at that, David.
- [Mrs. Beale] May I see that?
- Wow! Look at that.
[Edie] I thought I was
the cat's pajamas in that!
[Mrs. Beale] You did, Edie. See how
pretty Edie was when she was young?
It's perfectly foolish of her
not to look that way now.
She could, you know, if she
didn't worry about everything.
Didn't she look like a girl
that had everything? Huh?
[Edie]
This has inspired me.
I'll have to get another
brown tailored suit and grow my hair.
My God, I have no hair.
[Mrs. Beale] You never put any
lipstick on for this picture, did you?
- I have another kind on.
- You look horrible.
Why didn't you put
lipstick and makeup on?
[Edie] Mr. Beale smashed
the window of Burt Bacharach...
when he put this in the window
on upper Madison Avenue.
- [Mrs. Beale] For God's sakes.
- He offered me a job.
He didn't say to get out
of that family situation,
but he said,
"You need a job, Miss Beale."
[David] Didn't you expect that Edie
might get married someday?
[Mrs. Beale]
Oh, I did. I wanted her to.
Oh, I picked out some nice men.
She didn't like the men I picked out.
[Edie]
They were horrible.
[Mrs. Beale] She could have married
this Gerald Getty.
He was a millionaire, ;
he gave her a gorgeous ring.
She decided not to marry that guy.
She had to give the ring back.
She has a proposal of marriage
from Paul Getty.
Remember Paul,
the richest man in the world?
[Edie]
He married Teddy Lynch.
[Mrs. Beale] Then you could
have married Jordan McClanahan.
He was another millionaire,
and he wanted to marry you.
She just didn't want to get married.
That's all blamed on me.
[Edie]
No, I never fell in love until I was 31.
[Mrs. Beale] Well, how old
are you in these pictures?
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-four. That old?
- 1940.
- Very young looking for twenty-four.
France had just fallen...
to Hitler.
- But you never fell for a man.
- Paris, Paris, excuse me.
France fell,
but Edie didn't fall.
That was the thing.
See, I...
They didn't tell us that when we studied World War I, that everything was so awful with the Versailles Treaty, that we were soon going to get into something four years after I got out.
If I'd only known it,
I would have just... just enjoyed every single minute, just done everything.
[David] It must've been tough
on people. I remember as a kid...
so many loved ones being killed.
But you were the dating age.
A lot of my friends went
overseas and got married.
They went in the Red Cross.
They went to India, Australia.
They all got married.
One of my best friends
went to Australia.
If I'd have been able to go, she
might have persuaded me to go with her.
And she met somebody in the hospital.
She was working for the Red Cross, and she never came back to New York.
But I never had a chance to do anything like that...
'cause Mother wasn't well during the war.
She had her eye operation.
I missed out on everything.
I missed out on the reunion
of my graduating class in Farmington... because that was the fall that
Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in... and I was stuck here with Mother, the cats, the house and T. Logan... and I couldn't go.
- No, you said you didn't want them to know how old you were.
- The 25th reunion of my class.
- No, I think...
- "Well, I didn't want them to know my age," says Edie.
No, I would have enjoyed that, Mother,
because Jack Kennedy campaigned
to get in and won.
Get in the Farmington School?
That'd be a good place for him.
I don't know. I think
it would have been a lot of fun.
Yeah, everything's good that you didn't do.
At the time, you didn't want it.
- I couldn't get away.
- Well, that's the choice.
- You can't go back and say... feel gorgeous right now...
- I couldn't leave.
- and say, "Oh, why didn't I do this?"
- I couldn't leave.
Because you didn't feel then
the way you do now.
Everybody thinks and feels differently
as the years go by, don't they?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- What time is it, chickens?
- [David] What time is it?
- I want to go in now.
- It's, uh, 1:30.

Always. Here.

find it again, ; it drops to the bottom.
I lost my scarf.
I'll never get it again.
Best scarf I ever owned.
The most beautiful color of blue.
It dropped.
You know, it fell off my head.
[Whispering]
To hell with the Marble Faun.
- Hello?
- Hello, Edie.
Oh, hello, Jerry darling.
Do you want to come in?
I just came for the faucet so I can get down to the hardware store.
- Yeah, Mother said you called.
Was that you on the phone very early?
- Yeah.
How are you?
I'm looking at you now.
Really well.
I'll come down and let you in.
Do you want to come up here?
- You want to come up?
- All right, for a moment.
Mother's screaming to have me let you in. I'd better do it.
I'll be at the back door here, okay?
I'll come right down.
- Jerry's puffing and blowing.
- No. I'm tired, and I don't want to get any tireder.
What do you want, Jerry?
Who wants a nice piece of corn?
No. I don't want any.
Thank you.
Jerry, you didn't get
enough to eat tonight.
- Well, I can't resist. I'm sorry.
- The margarine.
Jerry, you're gonna put some of this on, aren't you?
- You wanna do it for me?
- Why, yeah. The pleasure's all mine.
If I don't burn myself.
Which piece of corn do you want, Jerry?
- Doesn't matter.
- See how polite he is?
You want some, Edie?
Where's your plate, Jerry, for it?
- I couldn't eat in front of the camera.
- I've got very big hands.
- [Edie Laughs]
- This corn is out of this world.
Oh, did I do it nicely? He always compliments me on the way I do my corn.
[Mrs. Beale Chuckles]
- [Clattering]
- [Edie] There they are.
There are your raccoons.
Run away from your drinks and do that to your raccoons.
[Albert]
Hear him?
[Edie]
Yeah, he's there. I can hear him.
Everything's in the attic,
everything from sloths, otters,
badgers, uh, possums, raccoons.
I don't leave the bags anymore.
'Cause I had to get up to 200 cellophane bags this, uh...
Horrors. Somebody's removing the books from my room.
Where did this little book come from?
[Jerry]
Edie!
[Mrs. Beale]
That's Jerry. He locked himself out.
No, Jerry hasn't locked himself out.
[Chuckles]
He locked himself out.
[Mrs. Beale]
Who's knocking at the door?
[Jerry]
Who is it?
[Whispering]
He's around there.
Who got this book out of my room?
I cleaned this whole attic up the other day.
Now, who's been dropping books around is what I want to know.
I would have seen that book.
He evidently has been up in that room reading it.
All right, Buster, old pal, come and get it.
[Mrs. Beale] There's somebody
knocking at the door, Edie.
Yeah, all right, Mother.
- [Heavy Knocking]
- Yes?
[Man]
Is Jerry here?
Oh, yes. I'll get him for you.
Just a minute. Hey, Jerry.
- Yeah?
- I think your friend's in the, in the, uh, front.
I found a little book
dropped in the attic, Mother.
- He's been up there.
- Well, you should keep him out.
He told me he was working
on that thing, ; he wasn't at all.
- Want a little bit, Edie?
- No.
- You don't want a little bit?
- [David Mutters]
- My God!
- What?
- I just thought of something.
- What?
Give me that. What did you think of?
What? Come on.
[Whispering]
The guy was standing outside the window,
and he was passing books out to him.
- You think so, Edie?
- Yes.
- I don't believe all that.
- Yes!
I don't believe it.
Want a taste, Edie?
- I don't want any.
- No. We lost the glasses.
The glasses are gone.
Next thing, those antiques
will all be missing.
See, you shouldn't have a contact with the outside world... because how do I know that there isn't something up in that room?
If you get what I mean.
You can't tell what's been put up in that room... or what's been taken out.
- [Sighs]
- Don't worry so much, please.
This cat's going to the bathroom right in back of my portrait.
- Oh, isn't that awful?
- No, I'm glad he is.
I'm glad somebody's doing
something they want to do.
[David Laughing]
I was frozen this morning when I woke up. Were you, Edie?
- I did drop. It dropped.
It dropped quite a bit.
- I missed you last night.
I was so lonely. She only left me one little kitty to keep me warm.
And all these blankets were on the floors, all this pile of stuff here.
Jerry's pretty good at waiting on me.
He can find things here that
I wouldn't find for half an hour.
- [David] Jerry, the major domo.
- I'm so sick of that kid.
- I have great pity for him.
- Lois says...
Well, you know the trouble.
- And I like him, but...
- Lois says... You know the trouble.
- [David] What?
- The trouble is, he's madly in love with Edie.
I said I thought Edie was madly in love with him. Pardon me.
He might as well leave right now,
'cause he's never gonna get it.
- So that's it.
- Get what? Sex with you?
- What he's after.
- He doesn't want any sex with you.
- Well, that's all they're after.
- An old person like you? Good God!
- So why don't you tell him right now?
- Unheard of. Unheard of.
- You should tell him right now so I'm not bothered by him.
- He doesn't want sex.
He's got about six girls
in East Hampton. He's so busy.
- No, but the point is, he thinks...
- I don't know what he's doing.
He's out every single night
with a different girl.
- Yeah, but that's, that's the point, you see.
- He had a wonderful time.
- He's gonna be here for years and years. I see this coming.
- He enjoys himself thoroughly.
- I hope.
- The guy's gonna be here for years and years.
- I doubt that.
- It's gonna be one of those things.
Like Tom Logan.
Aren't you gonna feed Whiskers, Edie?
Come on, go in and feed Whiskers.
Now, don't eat it.
Give it to Whiskers, please.
- You're thin. You want to get thin.
- She's very mean to me.
No. I have to be very strict.
The priest said she needed
a very strict hand.
[Laughs]
What the priest told me.
[Imitating Irish Accent]
"She sure needs a very strong hand, your daughter."
And I tried to give it to her, you know that?
After Mr. Beale, you know, stopped living in East Hampton,
I had a terrible hard time with Edie.
She just went wild after her father wasn't living here.
She went wild, absolutely wild.
I couldn't do anything with her at all.
Isn't it awful when a dancer gets fat?
Isn't it awful? God.
It's awful, I'm telling you.
It's awful! God!
My father believed in running the children's lives, you know?
He wanted me to get my master's degree, be a junior partner in his law firm.
- Take the ice cream.
- He was 165 Broadway, on the ninth floor, and my knees would start to shake...
coming down on the ninth floor
of Mr. Beale's office.
My knees were rattling.
My mouth was dry.
You were scared of your father.
And I'd go in, and he'd come forward out of his office with his watch in his hand, and then he'd look at the clock on the wall, and he'd say,
"You're five minutes late," he'd say. Oh, my God.
- No, he had a very...
- And then he'd sit down and look at me like this... and say, "Take it off.
Take that hat off.
"Take that lipstick off.
Take that nail polish off.
- How dare you wear those high heels!"
- Oh, she's just acting.
Don't you want some of this?
Butter pecan.
Mmm. Mmm.
He said the only thing
to be was a professional woman.
He did say that.
Didn't he, Mother?
Well, I wouldn't say it's the only thing.
He didn't want me to get married.
I don't think people should get married.
I don't believe in it at all.
If you can't get a man to propose to you, you might as well be dead.
- Oh, I don't think it's important.
- I think it's disgusting,
- Aunt Mary had the most wonderful life.
- Absolutely disgusting...
- Lived to be 94 years of age.
- To live alone.
What are they proving?
They have to around with dogs or other women or something.
- Dogs are lovely.
- I, I think it's terrible.
I'll take a dog any day.
[Chuckles]
Why didn't you marry the man you wanted to, like I did?
I think the saddest thing was my not marrying into the Obelensky family...
'cause I adore them.
- Any Obelensky is wonderful.
That's all I can say.
- He's a very sweet man.
If he's related to
the Obelenskys, he's okay.
- I didn't know he was any relation to them.
- Yes.
- I never knew it.
- Serge's, uh, nephew by his half-sister.
Now, there was a boy
I might have married.
Why didn't you marry
Paul Getty?
I said, "How did you
happen to come here?"
And he said, "Oh, I saw you at a dance,"
he said, "in South Hampton."
- I said, "You did?" He said, "Yes."
- He was just a kid.
He was 32. And I said,
"Eugene, what you need is a girl."
And he said, "No, Edith, I'm looking
for a wife. I wanna get married. "
- He wanted to take Edie to Westchester.
- Wasn't that cute?
Tom had just died, and I did not
want another man in my kitchen.
- I went downstairs...
- He'd just made a cookbook.
He'd just written a cookbook.
- Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes.
- Don't want any cookbooks.
Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes because he came from a celebrated family.
The Tyszkiewicz family.
And I suppose mother didn't want me to have anybody that was decent.
- You understand.
- I didn't want anybody in the kitchen.
It would have been perfectly all right for me to marry Tom Logan.
Why did you want to marry
a kid 32?
- I forgot to say that Eugene was a count.
- He didn't have a nickel.
I would have been Countess...
Countess Edith.
I didn't want my child to be taken away.
I'd be entirely alone.
Do you know what I go through with this awful stuff?
Listen, I've got to eat lunch.
I'm starving.
Well, you know me... always hungry.
- [Door Closes]
- I'm not gonna gain the weight back.
I didn't have any breakfast.
- I'll put some lipstick on.
- You want to give me something
to put on, Edie?
[Giggles]
I'm beginning to laugh.
- These are my brother's drawers.
- Give me something to put on.
And I feel so strongly about mementos
and everything because of Mother...
that I was never able to ever
clean out these desk drawers
and throw the stuff away.
- Would you believe that?
You know, it's childhood stuff.
- [Mrs. Beale, Indistinct]
- Oh, Edie, yoo-hoo!
- "Memorabalia" or something.
- Edie, yoo-hoo!
- I couldn't throw anything away.
- They're looking at this room.
- Oh, Edie!
Yeah, just a minute.
They discovered something terrific in here.
- Come on. I've waited long enough.
- Is it from Austria?
- Why, what happened?
- Never mind about me.
[Edie] "The moving finger writes
and, having writ, moves on. "
I was going to write
another line from Omar Khayyam:
"We come like water and we go like wind."
Edie, yoo-hoo!
- Well, I got that one up.
- Edie, bring me the telephone.
That's the man.
This is the woman.
- I can't tell.
- Are you getting me
the blue kimono, Edie?
I'm putting up the silver masks.
Edie, come here a minute. Hurry.
I can't get the thumbtack in the wall.
- I think I have the saddest life.
- Oh, Edie!
I have to go on with the redecoration of this room.
- Yeah.
- Can you get me something to eat?
All right.
[Edie]
I made this.
Those are roses
of all different years.
That's my shell collection.
You can't see it, it's so dirty.
Isn't that tragic?
That's... These...
Then I have two things to go there.
And "Around the World" is supposed to go there.
Edie, I can't do it.
- Open it. I can't do it.
- I'm just gonna put that up there...
'cause I like red in this room for some reason.
And I was gonna hang the birdcage right here... and have
"Around the World" there.
But I haven't gotten to that.
Perhaps I'd better begin taking
care of Mother and bossing her
and cooking her some food.
- What do you boys think?
- [David] Bossing her around?
Yeah.
I let her do what she wants.
I think maybe I ought to give her cooked meals at certain hours.
What do you think?
I don't have any clock.
You know,
I never know what time it is.
You think she'd eat them?
I don't know. You know her
better than anybody.
I give her her head. I let her do what she wants to do. I think it's awful.
She should eat, you know, chopped meat and a baked potato at a certain hour for luncheon.
Then have a nice little dinner.
But that takes timing.
No, I'm not ready, and I have no makeup on!
- [Albert Laughing]
- But things are getting better!
Did you find my sign,
"In bathtub"?
Right.
I couldn't believe it.
Come on in.
We're not ready.
- [Mrs. Beale]
Is that Al down there? Hello, Al.
- [Albert] Yeah. Hi.
- Take your time.
- Oh, God! I almost tripped.
I almost broke my neck then.
God, these stairs are dirty.
Oh.
[Giggles]
[Indistinct Chattering]
How could Edie leave these stairs like this?
Don't I look funny coming down these stairs, hmm?
- [David] No. You look great.
- Don't I? I feel funny.
I feel funny.
- Just like a night at the opera.
- Is it?
The night at the opera will be when
I get in that chair in the dining room.
That would be the night at the opera.
- [Edie]
Mother, Lois and Jack are here!
- Hello, Jack.
- [Lois] Happy birthday!
- [Chatters, Indistinct]
I say, where's the cushion, Edie?
Get the cushion. I'll ruin my dress.
- Oh, yes. She puts it here.
- Oh, God, and those chairs.
Are they dirty, those chairs.
Hello, Jack.
- Hi, how are you? Happy birthday.
- [Mrs. Beale Giggles]
Well, you're very cute
to celebrate with me today.
- [Edie]
I like you in that costume, Lois.
- Oh, why, thank you.
[Edith] I see Edie hasn't...
You better not sit on those chairs.
- They look very dirty.
- They can sit on paper.
I thought you were gonna
clean up, Edie.
I tried.
I swept the, uh, hall.
Well, I'm kind of disapp... Jack, you don't mind sitting by me, do you?
I swept the floor. We have wine.
I'll bring down the glasses.
Bring down the wine, please.
- And Edie is due...
Lois is due ginger ale.
- Okay.
But don't let the cats out.
How do you like that thing
Lois did for me, Jack?
Are your eyes good enough to see that?
- Oh, sure.
- How are your eyes?
[Edie Giggling]
- She's no waitress, I'll tell ya.
- [Giggling Continues]
Well, she's got a pretty heavy tray.
Leave the tray here, won't you?
Oh, no, she's not gonna.
She's gonna do just as she wants, you know.
She's a Schrafft's waitress.
They always do just as they want.
Here's to Mother.
May she live to be at least 80.
- [Mrs. Beale]
Oh, it's one more year. Ha, ha.
- She's in her 79th.
- She's in her 79th now... 79th year.
- [Radio Announcer, Indistinct]
She's gonna tell that to everybody in East Hampton, you know.
- [Jack] Well, that's life.
- Everybody's gonna know my age.
- Well, happy birthday.

- They both had two operations.
- And then they weren't good, either.
One lost her eye. One girl.
Yeah, the eyes disappeared...
dried up and disappeared.
She has double vision. She has to wear dark glasses over the cataract glasses.
She's absolutely cured, Edie!
- She's cured now.
- Did she say she was cured?
She said, "I feel wonderful."

Yeah, I am. Edith, you ever

I need that more than anything to write things down.
I have my things written all over boxes, all over the bed, everywhere.
I got Epstein's address.
I've got...
Who have I got there, Edie?
All the electricians in East Hampton.
- All of 'em. Isn't that a nice book, Edie? Look.
- Terrific.
I can't be late now
and I can't forget.
And I can't hate anybody and I can't do anything.
The little book is gonna keep me straight. Straight as a die.
Isn't that nice? I haven't had a little thing like that in ages.
- I had a wonderful time.
- Your hands are cold.
It did you no good, my food.
- Oh, no.

Did you know it?
The cats are in with me.
Will you turn the heat off?
It is terribly hot in here.
[Edie] Your room is terribly dirty.
It's got to be cleaned.
- Not tonight, Geraldine.
- There's a horrible smell.
I can hardly sit here.
I love that smell. I thrive on it.
Makes me feel good.
We have to hang the portrait and clean the room.

But you're very good, what you do see me as.
I mean, it's okay.
- Are you pleased with those?
- You know,
I see myself as a little girl.
- And all that.
- What I see is a very immature child.
She sees me as a baby, and I see myself
as... some kind of a little girl.
They see me as a woman.
I don't see that.
But when I get out of here, I do.
- You gonna babble on?
- When I go to New York City,
I see myself as a woman.

[Albert]
- Oh, yeah? How's everything?
- I guess you went out.
Then I called again.
You were busy.
- Guess what's happened.
- What?
What I had felt was in the cards.
I'm telling you, I'm not gonna spend another ten years with this.
You know, I spent ten years with the last.
- You mean Tom Logan.
- What is it now?
The Marble Faun is moving in.

- The Marble Faun.
- [David] Jerry?
- Oh.
- He just gave us a washing machine.

I gotta get out of here. I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life... washing clothes in that goddamn...

It came from this house they're gonna sell.
You know, he had a job as a gardener's assistant at this house.
And they're gonna sell the house, so they gave him the washing machine.
[Whispering]
But he's moving in.
Oh.
I can't watch him,
I'm telling you.
Of course, he's still gonna have the gardening job, you know.
But I think he gets home at 4:00.
So, Mother says... Do you wanna come in and speak to Mother?
- She'd like to speak to you.
- Okay.
Come on in. I'm pulverized by this latest thing.
Well, you do!
You have a beautiful face, like a girl.
Like, you look like my mother.
The absolute image of my mother, Jerry.
Jerry, you're not going
to drink anything, are you?
- No.
- Well, what are you gonna have?
- I'll wait for the chicken.
- You're waiting for the chicken?
You mean to say you're not gonna have soup or a drink... or a highball or something like that?
Don't you think we better have some rum?
Oh, no. She didn't put any papers
on that thing today?
I asked her to. Jerry,
I'm badly treated all along.

I don't think there's any point in my meeting anybody that doesn't like music, do you?
'Cause I can't stand them.
Finally, I can't stand them.
There's something lacking,
and it's music, isn't it?
I mean, in a man.
Well, it is nice to have a man who can play the piano for you.
- No, that isn't all.
She doesn't get it.
- You can practice.
Unless a man understands music, there's
no point in my even meeting him...
'cause I never could figure out
what was wrong.
You know, with stockbrokers
and tennis players and...
I tell you who was a songwriter
and a dancer and a playwright
and everything.
Eugene Tyszkiewicz.
But Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes.
- He didn't speak English well.
He'd only been here seven years.
- You didn't try his cooking.
- He might've poisoned you.
- He was Serge Obelensky's nephew.
- You wanna marry a stranger?
- I mean, he was a very, very decent guy.
- I looked up his horoscope.
He was born November the 14th.
- You want to marry a stranger?
- I have to go in now.
- We was a very wonderful boy.
Too young for me, probably... 32.
- Who was this?
- Eugene Tyszkiewicz. He was a twin.
- I couldn't stand having another cook in this house.
- That isn't the point.
And he actually proposed, under the window.
- He had no home.
He was living in a third-class hotel.
- Under the window.
- He didn't have a thing.
- He said, " Edith, if you want to get married, I'll marry you."
- Not one single nickel.
- And I think that was decent, don't you?
- I don't see why.
- He probably wouldn't have, but just the same.
Not one person had entered
Grey Gardens for many years... before Eugene Tyszkiewicz came around.
So I credit him with all the nerve in the world.
Why, no one
would even speak to us.
People who I had walked to the Maidstone Club with for years.
- Don't believe a word of it.
- Admiring all the other people.
- Don't believe a word of it, kid. Not a word.
- All the other people...
- [Rambling]
- If your father could hear you, he'd turn in his grave.
He'd say, "My God, Edie!"
Well, anyway, I think
you were very cruel, Mother.
- Well, I don't think it's nice.
- He came from one of the best
families in Poland.
And he was related to the Obelenskys.
And I think it's terrible that she wouldn't give me a chance with Eugene Tyszkiewicz.
- That was absolutely cruel to drive the only beau away!
- But he was 32!
- Do you want to marry a man 32?
- I don't care!
That was the only one... besides these horrible people that came around here!
- Have you got your thing lighted for that?
- [David] Yeah, we're all lit.
- He was only 32 and from a very good family!
- 32, and she's 52!
And she got rid of him in 15 minutes flat!
- No, he didn't. He said...
- I'm bored with all these awful people like Jerry!
- And all those people!
- That wasn't the truth. No.
Tell him the truth.
That was not the truth.
Uh, no, and that was not the truth.
He said, " How could such a warm, lovely person over the telephone... turn into anything so cold?"
That's what he said right down on the porch.
So I said, I said,
"You'd better go home."
Never said good-bye or anything.
"How could such a warm, lovely woman over the telephone turn into something so cold?"
I thought that was just a little too much.
Uh, I'll tell you the whole thing.
You might as well face it.
It's my mother's house, and she owns it, and she wanted the people she wanted in it... and she didn't want the people that I wanted in it.
But God knows whom I wanted in it.
I mean, besides Eugene,
and Mother wouldn't allow Eugene
to stay even 15 minutes.
But I had to spend ten years
with Tom Logan.
And now we have Jerry
who is Mother's friend.
So, you just can't do anything about it.
So I can see now why girls get married.
You know, they're forced into it.
It's all a question of who you want to stay with.
Of course, I'm mad about animals, but raccoons and cats become a little bit boring.
I mean, for too long a time.
[Laughs]
I don't know.
I don't know.
I better check on Mother and the cats.
She's a lot of fun.
I hope she doesn't die.
I hate to spend the winter here,
though. Oh, God.
Another winter.
[Whispering] Very depressing, you know, when winter sets in here.
You know, 'cause I don't like the country, and I don't want to be here.

Okay, go ahead.
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.
I was here when this crowd really came.
We expected fifty thousand a day, and there must have been a million!
I, myself, was hungry for two days, because I couldn't get any food in.
I couldn't get out to buy any food.
I was eating cornflakes for two days!
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!
And when they see this picture in the news, over the moving pictures...
...they'll really see something!
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...because it's been a long time gone..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time. It's a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Turn, turn any corner."
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."
"...what the people say."
"You know that something..."
"...is going on around here."
"But surely, surely, surely..."
"...one day I'm going to have my day."
"Oh, it appears to be a long, yes it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."
"...against the madness."
"You've got to speak your mind, yes, today..."
"...but don't, no, don't, don't try to get yourself elected."
"If you do, you'll have to cut your hair..."
"...and it appears to be a long, yes, it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time, such a long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...it's going to be a long time gone..."
"...but you know..."
"...the darkest hour..."
"...the darkest phase, is always just before the dawn..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long time..."
"...such a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part of running one of these things?
The worst part?
What's the worst part of running one?
I don't know.
You dig it all?
I guess the biggest hassle is dealing with politics. You know.
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?
And you got that solved?
Well, it looks that way.
How long did it take you to put it together. Two, three months?
Uh, been working on it for about nine months.
Nine months! Full time?
Are you in charge of the whole thing?
Yes.
But you got backers?
Partners and backers.
Where are you going to go from here?
I mean, are you going to do another one?
If it works.
Aw, you're really good tonight!
You know...
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!
There's only one thing I wish.
I sure have to pee!
And there just is nowhere to go!
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going to someplace, where I've never been before."
"I'm going, I'm going, where the water tastes like wine."
"I'm going where the water tastes like wine."
"We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay."
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."
"Just exactly where we're going, I cannot say..."
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."
"Because it's a brand new game and I want to play."
"No use in your running or screaming and crying..."
"...because you've got a home as long as I've got mine."
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."
"...because that is something everybody, everywhere does in the same way."
"I can't see why you called a friend from the other side."
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."
"...can you tell me who I am?"
"Say, can I have some of your purple berries?"
"Yes, I've been eating them six or seven weeks now."
"Haven't got sick once, probably keep us both alive."
"Wooden ships on the water..."
"...very free, easy, easy."
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."
"Silver people on the shoreline, let us be."
"Talking about very free and easy."
"All the ships that watch as you die..."
"...all they can do is echo your anguished cry."
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"
"We are leaving. You don't need us."
What do you think?
Well, what could I think?
We're in the middle of the, of the situation and we make the best of it.
It's about all we can do.
We were standing on the curbs watching them come in, uh, last night.
All the townspeople.
It was just like a, an army invading a town. It's hard to believe.
Do you live here?
No, we're here for a vacation.
Are you having one?
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.
Who is they?
Freaks.
Is that what you call yourselves?
Sure.
Why?
Well, because that's what everybody else calls us.
What do you call yourself that for?
Because we admit it. Compared to everybody else, we're freaks.
I don't think you are. As long as you behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.
I'm not putting bad connotations on the word "freak", you know. I'm just...
Don't you think that the word "freak" itself has a bad connotation?
It's whatever you think about it.
Last time we saw anything like this was at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.
That's right.
Like four ice cubes out of the bag, you know.
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?
Yeah, right.
I don't know, what can you charge them for ice cubes? You know.
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.
Something we needed.
As far as whether it will leave a favorable effect later, besides money...
...we'll know when the festival is over.
Uh, they're beautiful people.
Well is this festival affecting you in any way?
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.
In what way?
Just to take care of, to try to get the people fed,
I would say is one of the main objectives here.
I know all these young fellows here, they've got to be fed and they're going to get hungry.
I hope that they can bring enough supplies in for, for...
That seems to be the big trouble.
And traffic, that's... well, you know yourself without me telling you.
What's it done for business?
Oh, come on.
What's it done?
Increased it about what?
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.
I'll say one thing for the young people.
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like some kind of Biblical, epochal...
...unbelievable scene!
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars, they're strewn on the sides of the roads from the helicopters and...
...in all different angles, you know. They look like jackstraws and stuff like that.
There is this continual flow of people just riding the stream.
They're going along and it...
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.
Well, I mean, I mean, from a practical point of view, what do you think, how could they limit this crowd?
They didn't want this many people here, really, I don't think.
So you find the control points at the beginning of the highways...
...and those with tickets are allowed in and those without tickets are not.
You have to have some control.
You know, when you have man-eating...
...Barabunda ants coming over a hill in South America...
...they want to cut them off and stop them from coming. They make a ditch...
...they put oil in the ditch and they make a flame.
Now I'm not saying they should put up flames to stop the people...
...but there has to be some way of stopping the influx of humanity.
Uh, in numbers, tell me, how many do you expect?
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred thousand people here over the three days?
Where will you put them?
We have contracted for land surrounding the area...
...setting up camp grounds, water facilities, toilets, electric, food.
What does it cost to put one of these things together?
A fortune.
And I suppose the returns will also be good.
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't know what the returns will come up to...
...up to what it's cost or not, but...
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.
In other words, you have to make two million dollars to break even?
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.
The point is that it's happened and it's working...
...and it's enough for now.
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?
What is it the musicians have that they can communicate so well to the kids?
Music!
I mean, they've always had music.
Music has always been a major form of communication.
Only now the lyrics and the type of music is a little bit...
...more involved in society than it was.
I need something now, let me tell you, to kind of run as a voice over... when I'm showing this music on...
If you could, if you could tell me...
...that I can run your voice over while this music is playing...
...what the music is saying, kind of, you know, what that's about.
It's about what's happening now...
...and if you listen to the lyrics and you listen to the, to the rhythm...
...and, and what's in the music...
...then you'll know what's, what's going on with the culture.
I've got to split.
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.
I'd like to see a little bit of him.
Just natural sound, while he's getting harassed and bugged. Okay?
Now, goddamnit, I was going to call you last week!
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.
Now I'm going to order a five-passenger helicopter.
I'm really scared the roads are going to get jammed up.
If anybody wants anymore rooms...
...shows up with more people than they're supposed to have...
...tell them they can drop back fifteen yards and punt!
They've got about as much chance as a snow ball in hell...
...of getting a room closer than Middletown.

Middletown, New York.
Let's clear the road, please!
Peel back, peel back there!

But you know, it really is to the point where it's just a family, man.
All box office people please go to the main box office.
We don't need it any more.
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.
Number two, number three.
You are not giving the world's greatest three day freebee!
Okay, there's only one way to do it.
There's a way to do it, man.
There is no way.
The only way to do it is to get into a rap with...
It's okay. Come here. Come here.
This is one thing I was going to wait a while before we talked about it.
But maybe we'll talk about it now so you can think about it.
It's a free concert from now on!
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...
...we're going to put the music up here for free.
What it means is that the people who are backing this thing...
...who put up the money for it, are going to take a bit of a bath.
A big bath. There's no hype, that's true. They're going to get hurt.
But what it means is that these people have it in their heads...
...that your welfare is a hell of a lot more important...
...and so is the music, than a dollar.
Look, when they hook the electricity up, a great jolt runs all the way through here.
If you've got the ticket, you disconnect the circuit and...
...otherwise you disintegrate.
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim used to sing there. Did you know that?
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!
Could I get the picture, too?
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?
My name is Hugh.
How do you do? My name is Sue.
I'll see you around.
Ah, here they come, here they come.
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.
Some people call it bum trips. I don't think there is such a thing as a bum trip.
We're working with hobo voyages.
A half an hour after we release anybody from our section...
...we turn them into doctors...
...and they care for people that were tripping like they were when they came in.
Now people have been saying that some of this acid is poison.
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.
If you can find out who it is, we...
Anybody who thinks they've taken some poison, forget it.
And if you feel like experimenting, only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.
You know, the Japanese made that motorcycle.
The Japanese affected that thing over there...
...with the yellow robes, or the Indian.
Really does a lot for the music that motorcycle.
Who's on?
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.
So the order of everything just went kaplooey?
You're closing tonight, honey.
Maybe there'll be a few more people here by then.
I don't like a puny gathering like this.
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of my husband, David's, favorite songs.
And let me just tell you that he is fine. And...
...and we're fine too.
And David was just shifted from the county jail...
...which is very much of a drag, to Federal prison...
...which is kind of like a big summer camp...
...after you've been in county jail long enough.
See I just, just now got a letter.
I have it with me. About the trip from the county jail. Manacles on his legs...
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...
...where the first time he felt afraid in the whole thing, was a couple of...
...I guess guards, or something, they started talking very loud.
And he started saying...
...talking about the last draft case that they had been through...
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll get you, motherfucker," you know?
He just prayed a little bit harder.
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but it's not a very comfortable feeling.
But nothing has happened.
Anyway, this is, this is an organizing song.
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...
...after David had been in jail for two and a half weeks...
...he already had a very, very good hunger strike...
...going on with forty-two federal prisoners...
...none of whom were draft people.
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."
"...alive as you and me."
"Sez I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead!"'
"'I never died, ' said he."
"'The copper bosses killed you, Joe!"'
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."
"'Takes more than guns to kill a man'..."
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'
"And standing there as big as life..."
"...and smiling with his eyes."
"Says Joe, 'What they can never kill,"
"...went on to organize."'
"From San Diego up to Maine..."
"...in every mine and mill..."
"...where working men defend their rights..."
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming to carry me home."
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Well, I looked over yonder..."
"...and what did I see..."
"...coming to carry me home?"
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."
"...were a-coming for me..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Swing low..."
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home. Home!"
"See me,"
"feel me,"
"touch me,"
"heal me."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"Right behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"From behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."
"...about a-working all summer, just to try and earn a dollar."
"Well, I went to the boss, said, 'I've got a date."'
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'
"Sometimes, I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'
"'... if you want to use the car to go riding next Sunday."'
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."
"Says they, 'You can't use the car, because you didn't work a lick."'
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"I'm going to take two weeks, going to have a fine vacation."
"Going to take my problems to the United Nations."
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."
"'... l'd like to help you, son, but you're too young to vote."'
"Sometimes I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
Ladies and gentlemen...
...The Who!
The word I get is that...
...maybe the best thing for everybody to do...
...unless you have a tent or some place specific to go to...
...just carve yourself out a piece of territory...
...say goodnight to your neighbor...
...and say thank you to yourself for making this the most peaceful...
...most pleasant day anybody has ever had in this kind of music.
Well, music is a thing that...
Well, you're obviously not here for the girls.
Oh, that's good, that's a basic thing, you know, like...
...there are a lot of girls here and they're probably...
...a lot freer than, you know, other places.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of balling.
Well, you bring your own coals to Newcastle?
Are you two going together or are you just hitching together?
We've lived together for about four months, or five months.
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...
...a communal thing, or someone else would call a communal thing.
But it's just, we just live together...
...and so we just decided to come down together because we were coming here.
And like there's nothing, I mean, no definite thing about...
We're not necessarily going to be together throughout the whole thing.
So you're not particularly jealous of him?
Are you two going together?
But you two came up here together.
You like that?
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.
What do you think about all this?
Well, the way I look at it...
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.
When he moved into the family group...
...that I was alr... that I already knew for quite a while...
...in that time, I got to know him real well and I learned to love him.
Like, you know, we ball and everything, but...
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.
Because if we're not going together and we're not in love or anything like that...
Can you communicate with your parents?
I can communicate with them on, on one level.
Now that I've been away from home for two years.
But at first it was very rough.
Now...
...they, you know, they're beginning to mellow about it.
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.
But I can't really communicate to them...
...about anything that's really important because they just could not understand it.
My mother is really, she really...
...lives in a lot of pain...
...because she's sure I'm going to go to hell and there's nothing I can do...
...to tell her that there is, that it just does not exist for me.
So I, there's no communication on, on those levels.
My father was asking whether I was in a communist training camp or something...
...in, in the house that I lived in.
I could understand, you know, where he came from. Because when he...
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.
And so he came over here to better himself...
...economically and so forth, and all that other rot.
And, to make it better for me and he can't understand why I didn't play, you know...
...saying, "Why aren't you playing the game?"
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...
...which have so much value."
But they only have value to him...
...and he can't understand why they don't have value to me.
But he does have wisdom enough to know, to allow me to be who I am.
I guess he had some kind of idea in his head that...
...I will, by doing what I'm doing, learn for myself how to live.
And that's what he wants me to do, anyway.
So he, he can't understand why I am the way I am...
...but he, he very much wants me to be that way.
Because he knows that's the only thing for me.
He started his trip when he was four years old.
Really?
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?
Me, neither.
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?
I, I don't know. I, I used to be into drugs and...
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...
...now it seems like it's almost contrived.
It's like drugs and revolution and the united front and all.
You know, I'm a human being and that's all I want to be. And I don't...
...I don't want to have a mass change...
...because a mass change only brings around mass insanity.
I just want to be myself and find out, find a place where I can...
...maintain some kind of balance within myself, you know.
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip, you know. To be or not to be.
Do you think you could ever communicate with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?
I hope so.
They're doing their thing, aren't they?
I don't know. It's like they, they're neurotic or psychotic or...
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.
They could say the same thing of you.
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
I, I don't need all that power, you know.
Where I can just, I can just sit here right on this roadside...
...and I, I don't have to become
President of the United States.
And I don't have to go all that way up.
I don't have to make the climb.
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.
Do you have tickets to this thing?
No.
How are you going to get in?
I don't really know.
I figured, you know, once I got here...
...l'd see whatever happens and go along with it.
It's like people that are nowhere are coming here...
...because there are people they think are somewhere...
...so everybody is really looking for, you know, for some kind of answer.
Where there isn't one.
Why would three hundred thousand...
...or a hundred and twenty thousand sixty thousand...
...seventy thousand people come to anything just because it's music?
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.
People don't know, they don't know how to live and they don't know what to do...
...and they think that if they...
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...
...or how to maintain with it.
It's just like people are very lost, I think.
America leads the whole world in several ways.
Very recently, when
I was in the East...
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...
...met me and asked me...
...what's happening in America?
And I said,
"America is becoming a whole."
"America is helping everybody..."
"...in the material field..."
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."
"...with spirituality, also."
"At the hop..."
"...we can rock to and fro and never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."
"When the records are playing, people eat a lot of chicken..."
"...at the hop, hop, hop."
"If you've got a little chicken, share it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"
"We will go rocking and rolling and stomping at the hop!"
"When the records are playing and the women start a-singing at the hop!"
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"
Ladies and gentlemen, the Sha-Na-Na!
Harold, turn up the mike.
Now, very slowly, start coming back up.
Lower the lock and pull yourself back up.
And then keep breathing as fast as you can.
Then exhale.
And relax. Then just feel the energy.
These, these are all beginning exercises of Kundalini Yoga.
Yoga means union.
It's the same energy force that drugs give you with a rush.
Right? It's, it's the same channels...
...only drugs do it for you and this way you can do it yourself.
You can do it when you want to...
...and you don't have to score to be able to do it.
All you've got to score is some clean air.
I learned it in Los Angeles.
And there was only a couple of months of clean air when I was learning it.
That's hard, too, these days.
But while there's still some clean air left, it would be groovy to...
...experiment with it like those guys who have been experimenting for...
...at least six thousand years and getting very high behind it.
The Kundalini nerve, it's called the nerve of awareness.
You can't dissect it. It's a current that runs up the center of your spine.
I don't know if any of you have ever sat down...
...and crossed your legs and smoked
DMT and watched what happens.
But what happens to me is this big thing...
...goes "uuurrrah" up my spine!
And flashes in my brain!
Well apparently, that's what is going to happen if I do this stuff and learn it.
It takes years, I guess, but this is the beginning of it.
These exercises are exercises to create...
...those channels in your body and to free your body of blocks.
The major block is your solar plexus.
That's why we're doing a lot of breath of fire.
It loosens the solar plexus.
And there are blocks in your spine and...
...back and wherever you've got blocks, to keep that energy from flowing.
Go within yourself and meditate on each breath.
Make each breath a complete breath.
And if you do it right, you'll be flashing momentarily.
Just keep up, concentrate on your breathing and hold that position.
Roll your toes forward so they point forward.
We're going to leave you with the usual thing.
Only thing I can say, as I said to so many people, this title, just about...
...puts it all into focus. It's called
"With A Little Help From My Friends."
Remember it.
"What would you do if
I sang out of tune..."
"...would you stand up and walk out on me?"
"Lend me your ears and
I'll sing you a song."
"I will try not to sing out of tune, yes."
"Oh, I'll get by..."
"...with a little help from my friends."
"Well, I never come up alive."
"Hey, there are so many ways."
"Well, I'm going back there for my friends."
"What do I do when my love is away?"
"Does it worry you to be alone?"
"Ho, no, no."
"How do I feel at the end of the day?"
"Are you sad because you're on your own?"
"I'll tell, never say it any more."
"Going to get a little help from my friends."
"I've got to buy favors for them."
"Don't bother about the love I gave."
"Help me find my way."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, I need someone to love."
"Could it be anybody?"
"Oh, I need somebody..."
"...to dream about. I know her."
"Oh, I love her."
"Well, I'm going there,
I'm going there."
"Then I'm going to say that I'll know my way."
"Don't you know I care for my friends?"
"Would you believe in a love at first sight?"
"I'm sure that it happens all the time."
"You know it does."
"What do you see when you turn out the light?"
"I don't see nothing."
"I told you I get a lift, I've got to have a lift from my friends."
"Nobody cares the way I feel now."
"Oh, I sat there all alone."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, Lord, I don't need anybody."
"Could it be that you're lonely?"
"Oh, Lord, I love her. I'll stand by."
"Going to dream about her, I know I am."
"Somebody said, 'Oh, I love her'."
"I've got to get my friends, I've got to get my friends to go..."
"Don't you know I said, there before your eyes...?"
"...l've got to get my friends together."
"All I've got to do is that now."
"I'm going to take them home with me now."
"You've got to get all your friends now."
"...you've got to get all your friends now."
"Nobody goes away..."
"...nobody goes away, yeah."
"You've got your friends, you've got your friends..."
"...you've got your friends, yeah."
"With a little help from my friends."
"Got to have love from my friends."
The Grease Band and myself thank you all very much, indeed.
See you again! Beautiful!
It looks like we're going to get a little bit of rain, so you better cover up.
If it does and if we should have any slight power problems...
...just cool it out. We'll sit here with you. It will be okay.
All right, everybody, just sit down, wrap yourself up.
We're going to have to ride it out.
Hold on to your neighbor, man.
Please get off those towers!
We don't need any extra weight on them!
Please move away from the towers.
The lamps might give us a problem.
Everybody who is in the back, please move back.
We have to get away from these towers.
Please move away from the towers!
Put the mike stands down on the floor.
Cover all the equipment.
Let's keep it nice and cool.
We'll be back with Country Joe in just a second as soon as we get set up.
Okay, so come on down off the towers.
Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain! Yeah.
Please move away from the towers.
Jody, get off the stage.
The wind is blowing this way.
Please be on this side of the towers.
Everyone in the back, please move back.
Just take it calm and easy.
I see it. Please move away from the towers.
I think the wind has run through it.
It is okay?
Give us some room. Go slowly, but move back. It will be cool.
Just move away from those towers!
We don't want one of those lamps to be blown. Please!
That's it. Everybody just help get away from the towers and clear them.
And look up, very seriously. Let's think hard to get rid of it, please.
No rain! No rain! No rain!
Keep thinking it!
Keep your eyes on those towers.
It's going to blow through.
Try and keep yourselves comfortable.
And keep an eye on the towers.
Hey, cut the power off up there, all right?
What do you want?
We're going to have to turn off some microphones for a minute.
Hang in there with us.
God bless you and watch those towers.
Let me get down with the mike.
Oh, can I talk to you a minute?
Sure. What do you want to know?
Do you like the rain?
Yes, yes. It's nice.
It, it gets you clean.
What are you thinking about?
Does, is this encouraging, or what?
Definitely not. It's great! Just a little added attraction, that's all.
You, at least, you don't have to wait for clothes to get dry.
Groovy! I dig it! I dig it!
Do you think it's coming off well with all those fuck-ups, or what?
Yes. The only, the only hassle is the mud, that's all.
Does this discourage you at all?
Or is it all right?
Mud. A drag!
I can't believe it!
Do you feel discouraged at all, or is this all right?
It's a bummer!
It's fine.
Peace, brother!
I've got something to say.
I want to know how come the Fascist pigs have been seeding the clouds?
Right! For the last hour and a half.
Going over twice with that, with all...
...with all the smoke coming out of them, seeding the clouds.
I want to know, know why that stuff is going down there.
And why doesn't the media report that stuff to the people?
You want to talk about what's happened?
I'm telling you these planes...
...come over an hour and a half and they seeded all the clouds.
This is the second time they did it today!
I don't know what they hope to prove, man.
What's going on here?
Sharon Silverstein, return home immediately.
Your father has been taken for open heart surgery.
Please stop at the information booth right away.
The first Aquarian Exposition.
The forecast for this afternoon is...
...intermittent entertainment between intermittent showers.
Somebody was saying this is the second largest city in New York.
There's been no police.
There's been no trouble.
If you check the statistics out...
...you'll find that...
...these people have lived, over three hundred thousand people...
...have lived together peacefully, loving each other...
...feeling for each other, want, needing for each other...
...and wanting to make this the experience it is.
What are they doing?
They're dropping dry, they're dropping flowers and dry clothes.
Out of that helicopter?
You said a moment ago that this wasn't the end of this festival...
...that this was a beginning.
What do you mean, a beginning?
Well, well, look at it!
This is the beginning of this kind of thing.
This culture and generation, away from the old culture and the older generation.
And you see how they function on their own.
Without cops, without guns, without clubs, without hassle.
Everybody pulls together and everybody helps each other and it works.
It's been working since we got here.
And it's going to continue working.
And no matter what happens when they go back to the city, this thing happened.
And it proves that it can happen.
That's what it's all about, you know.
That's the whole thing right there.
Mr. Kornfeld, was, was this a suc... , a financial success?
From the point of view of the fellows that put it on?
It was a financial disaster!
Why do you say that?
Well, we just opened the gates and let everybody in. It's a free festival...
...paid for by the people who put up the money...
...or the people that are going to have to pay it back?
Uh, paid for by the people who bought the tickets.
The two hundred thousand, of which I don't know how many of them got here.
No, this was paid for by, by all the people that bought it.
By all the people...
...that had the thought that put it to the point, to get us in a position...
...to just be a tool, like, like a vehicle...
...like everybody else.
Just to get it to this point.
You're in the red?
Oh? The company?
Financially? If you tried to think in those terms...
...when you're talking about something like this...
...financially, this is a disaster.
But you, you, you look so happy!
I'm very happy!
You can't buy that for anything!
Sure, this is really beautiful, man!
These people are communicating with each other.
That, that rarely happens anywhere anymore.
It has nothing to do with money.
It has nothing to do with tangible things.
You have to realize the turnabout...
...that I've gone through in the last, in the last three days.
In the last three million years that I, meaning us, all of us...
What do you mean, the turnabout in the last three days?
Just to see, just to really realize, what's really important.
The fact that, that if we can all live together and be happy...
...if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street...
...if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody...
...what kind of a way is that to go through this life?
Marijuana!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Waters, Country Joe and The Fish!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We're certainly delighted to be here today.
I'd like to start off my portion of the show...
...by giving you a taste of a little something we call...
...rock and soul music.
"Oh, your love is like a rainbow..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, darling. Now..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, I said..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, all around my shoulders, yeah..."
"...performing all around my shoulders."
"You know that your love is like a rainbow..."
"...falling all around my shoulders.
And I said I love you..."
"...you know I do!"
A lot of freaks!
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big airliner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer..."
"...coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys?"
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"A guy with a ticket to Mexico..."
"...no, he couldn't look much stranger..."
"...walking in a hall with his things and all..."
"...smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"There's a hip woman walking on a moving block..."
"...tripping on the escalator."
"There's a man in the line, she's blowing his mind..."
"...thinking that he's already made her."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big air liner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer?"
Folk music has come a long way hasn't it, Arlo?
It used to be the walk down the road trip, you know.
It's incredible. I heard the
New York Throughway is closed.
This morning we heard they were backed down...
...on Route Seventeen with an eight hour delay!
Right. Well, the New York
State Throughway is closed.
It's incredible!
Isn't that far out?
I don't know if you,
I don't know how many...
...of you can dig how many people there are, man!
Like I was rapping to the fuzz.
Huh, can you dig it?
Man there are supposed to be a million and a half people here by tonight!
Can you dig that?
New York State Throughway is closed, man!
Yeah, it's far out, man!
Hey, man, I've just got to say...
...that you people...
...have got to be the strongest bunch of people I ever saw.
Three days, man, three days!
We just love you!
Tell them who we are.
They'll know if you just sing.
Test. Forty-nine. Sixty-five.
Hike!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome with us Crosby, Stills and Nash!
"It's getting to the point..."
"...where I'm no fun any more."
"I am sorry."
"Sometimes it hurts..."
"...so badly, I must cry out loud."
"I, I, I am lonely."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Remember what we said and did..."
"...and felt about each other."
"Oh, babe, have mercy."
"Don't let the past remind us of what we are, not now."
"I, I, I am not dreaming."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Tearing yourself away from me now."
"You are free, and I am crying."
"This does not mean I don't love you."
"I do. That's forever, baby."
"Yes, and for always."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret."
"Are you still listening?"
"Here is the lock and latch of the key to your heart."
"Yes, and I love you."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard, hard..."
"...and you make it hard, you make it hard."
"Friday evening..."
"...Sunday in the afternoon..."
"...what have you got to lose?"
"Tuesday morning..."
"...please be gone. I'm tired of you."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Can I tell it like it is?"
"Listen to me, baby..."
"...it's my heart..."
"...that's a sad feeling in your heart, and that's what I am."
"I've got an answer."
"I'm going to try and play."
"What have I got to lose?"
"Please come see me..."
"...Thursdays and Saturdays."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Chestnut brown canary..."
"...ruby-throated sparrow..."
"...sing a song, don't be long, thrill me to the marrow."
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Ring around the moonlight."
"Asking me, said she so free..."
"...'How can you catch the sparrow?"'
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Oozing life, not lamenting."
"Change my life, make it right.
Be my lady."
Thank you. We needed that!
This is our second gig.
This is the second time...
...we've ever played in front of people, man!
We're scared shitless!
That's near enough for jazz.
I'd like to say thank you again to you.
This is a thing called
"I'm Going Home by Helicopter."
"Going home, my baby."
"My baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I said I'm going home."
"Going home, my baby."
"Go home, my baby."
"'Go home, baby, I'm going."
"My baby, see my baby around."
"See my baby, see my baby around."
"Love you, baby,
I feel so good tonight."
"Going home, see my baby."
"I'm going home now, see my baby."
"Oh, baby, baby, see my wife."
"Ohh! Baby, going to have more fun."
"Baby, you don't go..."
"...baby, if we don't go..."
"If you don't go..."
"...baby, we don't go.
Man, you hurt me so."
"I love my baby with the red dress on."
"I'm going to shake it on a great big doll. I'm going to have more fun."
"Go back, baby, baby, I want to be a half with you."
"I love you, baby, Lord knows I do."
"I love you, baby, God knows I do."
"We're going steady, doll, that's what we're trying to do."
"Go on, baby, I love that way you walk."
"One for the money, two for the show.
Three to get ready, and go, cat, go, go!"
"Don't you step on my blue suede shoes."
"You can do anything, baby, but lay off my blue suede shoes!"
"Well, back it up, down in front."
"I've got a baby, mean as she can be."
"Not now, my baby, don't be mean to me."
"Yeah, I'm coming on, baby.
Oh, not sitting, going home."
"Climbing on, baby. Oh, I'm not sitting, going home."
"Well, baby, I'm not sitting.
Going home."
"Well, shake up, baby, shake.
Well, shake it, baby, shake."
"Shake up, baby, shake.
Shake, baby, shake."
"Well, love you, baby.
I love the way you walk to me."
"Oh, baby, I love that way you walk."
"I'll sit you right down, knock you off your feet."
"Whoa, baby, I've got a craving."
"I love you, baby, like God knows I do."
"Take your love, baby, yeah, one more time."
"Oh, do the stomp, do the stomp."
"I gave my baby, I gave one more time."
"Yeah, you quit, I'm going to see my baby."
"I'm going home.
Home to see my ba-baby."
"Oh, baby, I played the blues for you."
"Yeah, I love you, baby, with your red dress on."
"Baby, I love you so."
"I'm going home, I'm going home."
"Love you, baby.
Love that way you walk."
"I'm going home."
"Love you, baby. I'm going home."
"Look out, baby! I'm coming to get you!
One more time! Going home! "
"Yeah, home, baby.
Going home, home to my baby."
"Going home. I'm going home.
I'm going home."
"I'm going home, home, home, my baby."
"Going home to see my mama!"
Ten Years After!
Please a warm thank you for Ten Years After!
Alright friends, now you have seen the heavy groups...
...now you will see morning maniac music.
Believe me.
It's a new dawn.
The regular guys.
Don't you get a dial tone, or anything?
Yeah, there are some toilets around here, some of those rolling outhouses...
...like they had in Newport.
You ask for somebody that doesn't exist...
...and then they don't accept the charges and they know you're okay.
You cheat the telephone company.
Oh, yeah. I'm fine, man.
We don't take the car. We walk.
It's the only way to get there.
Why? Because my mother wants to make sure I'm all right.
I'm going to call my mother and father because...
...oh, they think this is going to be like another Chicago.
Like I'm going to get my head beaten in.
They're terrified. So I'm going to call and tell them...
..."Ha-ha, I fooled you. I'm alive!"
They've got, they've, you don't even have to bother bringing your tickets...
...or anything, because they're not going to collect them.
There's no way they can.
They've got a fence that's half up...
...and there are people just sitting in that field.
It's really beautiful.
I'll try. It's like I say, really, you know how crowded it is here.
It, it's just swarming! What?
Out, out on the ground.
It was nice. We got wet.
All I miss is the bathtub.
Okay. Goodbye.
I didn't even finish dialing and they said...
It's so great in some ways and so lousy in others.
Look at the people you're meeting.
Everybody is here for one purpose.
It's ridiculous!
It's getting worse every time.
There is no water. No water, no food and no medical supplies.
Why don't we pray for rain?
They're telling everybody to go home.
They called it a disaster area.
Oh, that's rot!
They called this a disaster?
You should see, everybody's happy!
Who are you calling?
My mother.
Somebody may have noticed, or all of you may have noticed...
...a familiar colored helicopter over there.
The United States Army has lent us some medical teams...
...and giving us a hand.
They're with us, man.
They are not against us.
They're here to give us all a hand and help us.
And for that they deserve it.
There are forty-five doctors or more.
I know at least forty-five...
...who are here without pay because they dig what this is into.
Look, it's acid and shit like that.
One kid died, a heroin overdose.
Yeah, another guy died.
Run over, I believe.
The army is really doing a great job, you know.
All those guys calling them pigs and shit like that, it's not right.
They've done a good job.
Dr. Jack Maitland, please, with full suturing equipment...
...your presence is requested.
You've got a delivery to make!
Marilyn Cohen. Wherever you are, Marilyn Cohen...
...Greg wants you to meet him at the information booth...
...because he wants to marry you!
There goes Marilyn!
About how long does it take to...?
Well, before it was backed up, eight hours.
And they've been working at it and there are still some cats...
...that think they can come here for Sunday.
And they're stopping them in Monticello and all that, you know...
...so it's really getting to be a mess.
So, you know what I would do?
I would wait, because this way...
There's no gas in the gas stations.
Because this is the third largest city in the world.
So I would wait, you know?
Until when?
Until this traffic starts clearing up.
You know, like Monday morning.
I've got to be in North
Carolina Monday morning.
Oh, wow! Do you? Why? A job?
Well, like what? This has been declared a disaster area.
Because I called long distance to Buffalo...
...and asked some cats there and they said...
...it definitely has been declared a disaster area.
Is there any way to get out?
They're trying to evacuate it today.
So maybe late tonight, you know.
You know, like one.
How are they going to evacuate?
We're not sure. I think they're trying to get all the cats in the cars...
...and just direct the cars to get out.
I mean, you can try it.
I mean, like it's all up to you, man.
But if your car gets, you know...
Yeah, if you run out of gas somewhere, there's no gas in the stations.
You're screwed.
Yeah, I mean, like you'd be even more stuck on the highway...
...than you are here, because...
...at least here there are a lot of other cats.
I have to get out of here because there are just too many people!
And I can't leave because my friends will be lost.
And I can't, I can't stay here any more. It's too crowded!
We are only taking drastic emergencies.
Nobody worries. Nobody up here has any money.
You could live and eat here a week without money, so don't worry about it.
I know, but I've got to go back to California.
You can get a ride to California, too.
You know, everybody here, it's the same thing with them, you know.
You just have to dig it and live with it.
About thirty hours, at least.
Thirty hours straight? No naps?
Are you on speed?
No, I'm not on anything.
Blind faith?
Blind Faith is a groovy group.
You wouldn't believe some of the kids that come in here.
They're really spaced out. Last night, this cat, this cat comes in and says...
..."If anger is red and envy is green, what color is jealousy?"
And I mean he's really spaced out!
And you just don't go fucking people's heads up when they're spaced out!
So I said, uh, "Black, right?
Because jealousy is poison."
He says, "Yeah, but it's got to be something else than that."
And I said, "Green, because after all, jealousy is like envy."
"Except that envy is over things and jealousy is over people."
"A lot of people treat other people as, you know, things."
And he says, "Wow! Groovy!"
And he walks off and I never saw that cat!
Another cat comes up and he asks me to tell him about his wild eyes!
Did he have wild eyes?
He was speeding. Really groovy.
And all the people that come up here asking, you know...
...if we can page their freaked out friends.
I mean, like right now
I'm missing my sister.
I lost her. She was on, uh, on mesc.
And I lost her during
Richie Haven's performance.
I've got her tickets home.
I haven't seen her since.
She's all right.
Sure she is.
It's just that I'd like to see her so I can get home in time.
She's got to be back Monday for Court.
Otherwise, you know, I wouldn't care.
Otherwise, I'd probably let her hitch home.
City McGee...
...please come immediately to backstage right.
I understand your wife is having a baby.
Congratulations!
John Sebastian!
This is really a mind fucker of all times, man!
I've never seen anything like this, man!
It's Newport, right? But they owned it.
It was something else!
Just love everybody around you, and clean up a little garbage...
...on your way out and everything is going to be all right.
And Chip. My man, Chip.
Aw, you're doing so well, man.
He says to look out for the fence, too, man. You have to look after the fence.
Like the, the press can only, can only say bad things unless there ain't no fuck-ups.
And it's looking like there ain't going to be any fuck-ups.
This is going to work!
I'd like to hear a tune about...
...I guess about those discussions
I was talking about that...
...small circles of friends around living rooms...
...around pipes, when they weren't selling any papers on the street...
...and we weren't walking around this beautiful green place smoking, and...
...not being afraid.
There's a cat, and I really don't even know his name...
...but I remember that Chip said that...
...his old lady just had a baby and that made me think.
Wow, it really is a city here!
But this is, this is for you and your old lady, man! Whew!
That kid is going to be far out!
"Why must every generation think their folks are square?"
"And no matter where their heads are, they know Moms ain't there."
"Because I swore when I was small, that I'd remember when..."
"...I knew what's wrong with them, that I was smaller, then."
"I determined to remember all the cardinal rules..."
"...like sun-showers are legal grounds for skipping school."
"I know I have forgotten maybe one or two..."
"...but I hope that I recall them all before the baby is due."
"And I know he'll have a question or two..."
"...like, 'Hey, Pop, can
I go ride my zoom..."
"...that goes two hundred miles an hour..."
"...suspended on balloons?"'
"'And I can put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue..."
"...and imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?"'
"And I must be permissive..."
"...understanding the younger generation..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid..."
"...then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid assumes..."
"...and all my deepest worries must be his cartoons..."
"...and still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done..."
"...relating to what he can do when he becomes a man..."
"...and still he'll stick his fingers in the fan..."
"...and, 'Hey, Pop, my girl friend is only three..."
"...she's got her own bitty phone and she's taking LSD..."
"...and now that we're best friends, she wants to give a taste to me."'
"'But what's the matter, Daddy?
How come you look so mean?"'
"'Could it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"'
No, it's not true, because we're doing it! I love you. Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Sebastian!
Give me an "F"!
Give me a "U"!
Give me a "C"!
Give me a "K"!
What does that spell?
Fuck!
Sing it!
More! More!
Country Joe!
Sir? You live here?
I sure as hell do!
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
I'm right here to answer them.
Have you been affected by this festival at all? In any way?
What? We lost all of our milk.
We're just trying to put together a film, to show what the whole picture was like.
You know, from all sides.
How do you feel about it?
Do you want me to explain in plain English?
A shitty mess!
Tell me, in what way?
No bathrooms.
Our hundred fifty acres.
Gone, that's all.
And we didn't rent to them.
They all trespassed, every one!
Clarence, first tell me where you want this to go.
Can I ask you a question?
Is it okay if we use your telephone?
Oh, we have none. It's out.
This is a disaster area.
We don't even have a phone.
It's been out since yesterday morning.
Water?
Water I can give you.
And I'm sorry the phone has been out, I had an emergency call.
It's a disgraceful mess, if you want to know the answer!
What, specifically, has happened to you?
My fields are all cut up.
Our second cutting of hay is going.
Our cows, the milk truck didn't get here.
The milk had to be thrown out.
May I ask you how much money you made on this, uh, four days?
I have no, no conception.
Did you make five thousand dollars? have no idea.
It's too private a question?
It's, it's not only too private,
I didn't even have a chance...
...to total up the amount of purchases we made...
...the amount of money we took in.
We just, uh, haphazardly sent it to our home...
...and had it locked up until we had a chance to sit down and count it...
...which would probably be in about, uh, two to three days.
Would you like to see it again next...?
I'd love to see it again!
You'd love to see it, though?
I can't say the farmers would.
Well, it, it's, it's a matter of opinion.
What are your feelings about the garbage?
Where there are people, there is garbage.
You, you can't stop, stop progress.
Saturday night we got word over WVOS that...
...a lot of kids in town didn't have anything to eat.
Word went out that everybody should contribute food.
We went over to the park...
...the village permitted them to camp there.
A police car went up the street here with a loud speaker...
...and told the kids to come up there.
And we fed them Saturday night and all day Sunday.
Excess stuff was taken over to the school and they flew it to the, to the site.
How do you feel about them now?
Very good. I have a nineteen-year-old myself.
He's out on the Coast, and I felt that we've got to give them a fair shake here.
If kids are hungry, you've got to feed them. I don't know...
...maybe we ought to put, we ought to put everybody on pot.
And those kids were all happy.
They were all on pot.
Well, whatever it is...
It never should have happened.
If pot makes them happy and no trouble...
...maybe we ought to put all the adults on pot!
You want a fifteen-year-old girl sleeping in the field in a tent?
What are you, out of your mind?
It never should have happened!
Do you feel bad about the kids who were killed in Vietnam?
This has nothing to do with...
It's the same thing. The same thing.
There's no comparison.
People get more excited about the kids in Monticello than they do about...
Fifteen-year-old kids sleeping in the field?
They wanted to.
They're all high on pot!
Look, maybe if pot made them peaceful, maybe we all should take pot!
I was giving them water all along the road here, right up on the bridge...
...and they were not on pot!
Very lovely children, believe me.
They were selling stuff.
There was plenty of stuff there.
There's no doubt about it.
They had hundreds of kids in that house.
If you have four hundred and fifty thousand kids...
...and you've got two or three hundred...
...they were selling these, these blue acid tablets...
...which are bad, and they were selling them.
True, but figure the law of averages.
If you took 500 adults and brought them together and had plenty of booze...
...you know what would have happened?
You didn't see any drunks.
That's right. There was no fighting.
There was nobody stealing.
We had to feed them! What the hell else was there to do?
There was nothing else to do!
Having a good time?
Very nice.
The water is nice.
We were all sitting on a tree stump over there.
And the more people got on it, the lower it got.
About a year ago, I wouldn't have believed this was the way to swim...
...but this is the way to swim!
It's the way to go all the time, actually.
Think that's going to happen?
It's got to happen!
You go walking down the street where all the cars were coming in...
...and it's just the first day, and it was just beautiful!
Everybody is free.
Everybody is talking.
Everybody is really nude.
I don't think, uh, people come here to get uptight.
They come here to dig what's going on.
And even if they don't get into a festival, it's just a groove...
...being with all the people.
You know, you realize all over the country, they're coming together.
You realize that you're not the only people in your city...
...who are doing the things you are, but they're everywhere.
We're taking over!
I think the body is beautiful.
I think skinny dipping is just beautiful if, if you want to do it, if you can do it.
Some people can't, because all their...
...their environment made them, you know, feel that it's wrong.
Even though they know in their subconscious that it's right...
...it's kind of normal and natural, but we've been made to feel that it's wrong.
Row, row, row!
"Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream..."
"...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream."
No, I haven't done this too often before.
Get it pointed in the right direction!
Well, did I miss any big spots?
Your cheekbone.
Here?
Why don't you tell me something really interesting?
I can't, really, standing there with the microphone.
Don't worry about it. Don't let it intimidate you. It's just a microphone.
I know, but it's very intimidating.
Just tell me anything, like anybody you'd like to meet.
Oh, wow! I don't know.
What did you think about the kids?
From what I've heard from outside sources for many years...
...I was very, very much surprised.
And I'm very happy to say...
...we think the people of this country should be proud of these kids.
Notwithstanding the way they dress or the way they wear their hair.
That's their own personal business.
But their, their inner workings, their inner selves...
...their, their self-demeanor cannot be questioned.
They can't be questioned as good American citizens.
That's kind of surprising coming from a cop.
I'm not a cop. I'm a Chief of Police.
We've got one more tune for you.
It's called "Soul Sacrifice."
Ladies and gentlemen, Santana!
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher."
"Baby, baby, baby, light my fire!"
"I'll take you higher."
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta, wanta take you higher!"
What we would like to do is sing a song together.
Now, you see, what usually happens...
...you get a group of people that might sing...
...and for some reasons that are not unknown anymore, they won't do it.
Most of us need approval.
Most of us need to get approval from our neighbors...
...before we can actually let it all hang down, you dig?
But what is happening here...
...is a sing-along. Now, a lot of people don't like to do it...
...because they feel it might be old-fashioned.
But you must dig that it is not a fashion in the first place.
It is a feeling...
...and if it was good in the past, it's still good.
We would like to sing a song called "Higher"...
...and if we could get everybody to join in, we'd appreciate it.
"Wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
What I want you to do, is say "higher" and throw the peace sign up.
It will do you no harm.
Still again, some people feel that they shouldn't...
...because there are situations where you need approval...
...to get in on something that could be so good.
"I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
Now, if you'll throw the peace sign up and say "higher", get everybody to do it.
There's a whole lot of people here and a whole lot of people...
...might not want to do it...
...because they can somehow get around it...
...they feel there are enough people to make up for it...
...and on and on, et cetera.
We're going to try higher again, and if we get everybody to join in...
...we'd appreciate it.
It will do you no harm.
"Yeah, I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
"Way upon a hill, I'll take you higher!"
"Yeah, I'll take you higher!"
"Going to take you higher!"
"Higher!"
How are you out there?
You're staying stoned and you've got enough water...
...and you've got a place to sleep, and everything?
Good morning.
What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand.
Now, it's not going to be steak and eggs, or anything...
...but it's going to be good food and we're going to get it to you.
It's not just the Hog Farm, either.
It's like the Ohio Mountain family and the Pranksters...
...and everybody else that volunteered...
...putting in their time into the free kitchens. In fact, it's everybody.
We're all feeding each other.
We must be in heaven, man!
There's always a little bit of heaven in a disaster area.
So, if you want to make it back to your campsites, we'll try and get the food to you.
Or if you stay here, we'll try and get the food to you.
Now, there's a guy up there, some hamburger guy...
...had his stand burned down last night.
But he's still got a little stuff left...
...and for you people that still believe that capitalism isn't that weird...
...you might help him out and buy a couple of hamburgers.
Okay, here it comes! Mess call!
Good morning.
Left side of the audience, stage right here...
...that wants to be fed...
...has got to slowly move it through the forest...
...to the Hog Farm where we've got about seventeen lines going, uh, to serve with.
If you start your lines going through the forest, you'll wind up...
...going into a line that will take you right to where all the food is being served.
Helen Hayman, to the front.
Jim MacLean, please go to the pink and white tent hospital as soon as possible.
And kissing builds up your mouth.
Richard Moss and Barbara, meet us at the information booth.
Cort Ritcher or Greg Hollander, go to the Ferris wheel at twelve o'clock.
Greg's sister has his medicine.
Okay, Gayle, wow!
S, i, r, i, n, c, i, o, n, e...
...meet your daddy-o at the first aid station, near the security office.
If you've got food, feed other people.
Bugsy, to the pink and white tent.
Keep feeding each other.
And if you're too tired to chew, pass it on.
We have a gentleman with us.
It's the gentleman upon whose farm we are. Mr. Max Yasgur!
Is this on?
I'm a farmer. I don't know...
I don't know how to speak to...
...twenty people at one time, let alone a crowd like this!
But I think you people have proven something to the world.
Not only to the town of Bethel, or
Sullivan County, or New York State...
...you've proven something to the world.
This is the largest group of people ever assembled in one place.
We have had no idea that there would be this size group...
...and because of that you had quite...
...a few inconveniences as far as water and food and so forth.
Your producers have done a mammoth job to see that you're taken care of.
They would enjoy a vote of thanks.
But above that, the important thing that you've proven to the world...
...is that a half a million kids...
...and I call you kids, because I have children that are older than you are...
...a half a million young people can get together...
...and have 3 days of fun and music and have nothing but fun and music.
And I, God bless you for it!
I see we meet again.
"Purple haze was in my brain."
"Lately things don't seem the same."
"I'm acting funny, but I don't know why."
"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."
"Purple haze all around."
"Don't know if I'm coming up or down."
"Am I happy or in misery?"
"Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me."
"Help me, baby. Help me, baby!"
The oldest and driest desert in the world.
Fifty thousand square miles of eternally shifting sand.
You'd think nobody could make a living here.
And yet, when the wind dies down and the dust settles...
...you see a tiny track, and many more.
No matter how harsh and inhospitable a place is...
...there's always someone who's willing to live there.
A whole community of little creatures have had millions of years...
...to adapt to the impossible conditions in this desert.
This one must have had three legs.
This one only one.
The beetles who live here have an air-cooled cooling system...
...like a Volkswagen, so they have to run like crazy to keep their cool.
Even courting has to be done on the run.
A quick kiss at full gallop, and the romance is over.
When you can't run any longer...
...you have to dig like mad to get out of the heat.
He goes in upside down.
He doesn't dig, he just walks right in.
And this one pulls the blanket over his head.
And the gecko dives in as if the sand is water.
This beautiful person has a different cooling system, more like a limousine.
She doesn't have to dash around like those Volkswagen types.
She can take life more slowly.
She even has a windshield wiper.
She cleans her eyes with her tongue.
And digging is done at leisure.
First the right hand, then the right foot at half speed.
Then the left hand, left foot...
...right hand, right foot.
The sidewinder's favorite meal is the diving gecko.
But geckos play hard-to-get.
So the sidewinder resorts to a very sneaky trick to catch his prey.
First, he buries himself in the sand until he is quite invisible.
Then his tail comes up and pretends to be a blade of grass.
Now, geckos don't eat grass, but ants do.
And geckos eat ants.
At this point, things happen rather quickly.
Ant goes for tail, gecko goes for ant...
End of gecko.
So some die and some live in the heart of the unearthly Red Namib Desert...
...in southwest Africa on the tropic of Capricorn.
And on the fringes of the Red Namib...
...lives the real miracle of the desert, the oryx.
The most beautiful of all antelope.
These amazing animals always manage to look sleek and well-fed...
...in this arid region where there seems to be no food and no water.
The austere beauty of the Namib remains undisturbed...
...because man finds the region so intimidating, he hardly ever intrudes.
But to the oryx and the little creatures of the Namib...
...this waterless, hostile desert is paradise.
Where the red desert ends, there's a vast white desert...
...where it's so quiet, you can hear the silence.
The White Namib, a region of rugged moonscapes and endless vistas.
Here the eye can feast on breathtaking beauty...
...but for the mouth, there seems to be nothing.
Still, oryx roam its boundless plains...
...and on the barren slopes of a desert mountain...
...you'll find a whole tribe of baboons...
...who are quite content to live in these grim surroundings.
Of course, those rocks do get rather hard after a while.
Home comforts are few, but they don't seem to mind...
...the lack of modern conveniences.
Their social system works very much like human society.
At the very top, there's the big chief whose word is law.
And at the very bottom, there's the little guy...
...who likes to mind his own business.
Now you know who's important around here.
Actually, they're a happy gang.
And when it cools down towards evening, they get playful.
And then the acrobatic types start showing off.
Some don't do it very well, but they're willing to work at it.
Trees are very scarce in the White Namib...
...so the little weaverbirds have learned to share and cooperate.
They build large condominiums where dozens of families can live...
...each in its own apartment.
And they go in for quite a variety of architectural styles:
Squat ranch type, complex...
...modern, artistic...
...high-rise, and even symbolic.
Some nests are more than 100 years old, and the little tenants...
...are continually building on, remodeling and repairing.
A cozy little community where you can raise a contented family.
But sometimes tragedy strikes.
Once in a long while, a dewdrop will hang in just the right spot...
...at the right time, to focus the sun's rays on the dry, combustible thatch.
In a few minutes, the flames destroy a hundred years' work...
...and bring grief to many families.
The vast White Namib is only a narrow band...
...on the map of the immense
African continent...
...but it's gradually encroaching deeper and deeper inland...
...creating a region of scrubby growth and very little grass:
The Pre-Namib, where the dainty springbok roam.
This used to be lush grassland, but for the past 10,000 years...
...the Pre-Namib has been slowly drying out, and the animals and plants that live here...
...have to adapt to a climate where the rainfall...
...gets less and less as the years pass.
Some plants have adapted magnificently to the challenge of the changing climate.
Stapelia flowers, for instance...
...had to evolve a way of getting pollinated...
...in a region where there are no bees.
So instead of emitting a pretty smell to entice bees...
...they put out a powerful stench like a rotting carcass...
...and this attracts the blue fly, who likes smelly meat.
As he scurries about looking for that lovely, stinking food he can smell...
...he does a good job of pollinating the flower.
When he finally realizes he's been tricked, he flies off in disgust.
But he has done something useful for once.
In a few short weeks after the rain...
...this plant grows quickly to maturity, bears seeds, and dies.
But even after death, it protects its seeds...
...in those strange-looking pods for a year or more...
...until the rain comes again.
Then the moisture causes those dead parts...
...to move like bizarre living creatures, and they open up.
And then the moisture triggers little springs inside the pods.
The seeds are shot out in a hurry...
...to germinate and grow while the soil is still wet...
...so they can bear more seeds to start the next generation.
An incredible variety of animals...
...have accepted the challenge of living in the Pre-Namib...
...where you are never sure whether it'll rain this year or next year.
The scaly anteater, who looks like a tired medieval knight in armor.
The wart hog, who's so ugly, he's beautiful...
...and who always goes into his home tail-first.
Porcupines, who should know better than anyone...
...not to go through the same door at the same time.
The scorpion, who carries her babies on her back.
The chameleon, whose eyes move independently...
...so he can see where he's going and where he's been.
He must be the only creature in the world...
...whose left eye doesn't know what his right eye is doing.
The dikkop, who spends 95%% of his life looking like a stuffed bird...
...because he stands so very still and never blinks.
When he does move, it's only for a split second...
...and then he freezes again.
And then there are wildebeests...
...and ostrich and starlings...
...and zebra and giraffe.
There's a whole treasure house of animal life...
...in the wide and thirsty Pre-Namib.
It's also lion country, and at the water holes...
...the animals are nervous and skittish.
Even the appearance of a cub causes sudden panic.
Which, of course, makes Junior feel mighty superior.
Some days, the animals will drink quite calmly...
...in the presence of a whole pride.
They seem to sense that the lions have eaten well...
...and will not be hunting today.
In fact, the king's belly is so full, it gets up long after he does.
So who's afraid of a slob like that?
But if one of the younger generation gets cheeky...
...that slob suddenly walks like a king again.
His Majesty knows how to cope with the generation gap...
...and he will make an example of the young upstart...
...who has dared to challenge the establishment.
A long, long stare until the young one is thoroughly cowed.
And now the young rebel has to lie down again...
...so that the king can come walking past once more.
And this time he knows he'll be shown the respect due to him.
He's not even a very imposing specimen, as lions go...
...but he does remember that he's descended from a long line of kings.
The hyena could have been king of the desert.
His jaws are stronger than those of a lion, and he has those powerful forequarters...
...but nature saw fit to give him a weak and wobbly rear end...
...and a slow, ungainly gait.
So instead of being king of the desert, he's a lowly trash collector...
...who lives off the leftovers of the lion and other hunters.
It's just as well he's not the king, because he's a real stinker.
He's a coward. He's sneaky.
He often slobbers and drools.
He loves to roll in the rotting remains...
...of some dead animal to mask his own smell.
He has a silly giggle.
And, worst of all, he's not content to live on garbage alone...
...so he'll eat the babies of other animals when he can get to them.
The faster ones get away because he's too lazy to exert himself...
...but the smaller and slower ones are in constant danger.
Yellow-billed ducklings are fortunate...
...because their mother is a very clever actress.
She also has great courage.
When she sees a hyena prowling about, she tells the kids to be quiet...
...and walks towards the hyena...
...while they start sneaking away towards the water.
Now she gives a quack to get the hyena's attention...
...and goes into her wounded-bird act.
She really hams it up...
...because she's got to keep him from spotting the chicks.
So she flounders about pitifully to convince him he can catch her easily.
But when he gets too close, she recovers miraculously...
...and streaks for the water.
For a moment, he begins to doubt the sincerity of her performance...
...but she quickly goes into her next act, the pathetic drowning duck...
...with all the cries for help and all the "glub-glubs" the scene calls for.
So he believes her again and follows her at his leisure...
...because he's sure she's easy meat.
And behind his back, the chicks slip quietly into the water.
This is a crucial moment, because they have to swim across open water...
...to get to a safe hiding place...
...so she dare not let his attention wander away from her.
And she has to let him come dangerously close...
...to keep him convinced he can catch her.
When at last the chicks reach the hiding place...
...she can consider her own safety and make another miraculous recovery.
And he begins to wonder whether he's been taken for a sucker.
Somehow the scavengers and the carrion-eaters...
...are the unbeautiful people of the desert...
...not only in looks, but also in character.
The stuffy-looking marabous...
...are members of the elegant and aristocratic stork family...
...but thousands of years ago, they started making their living by disposing...
...of the remains of dead animals...
...and they began to look more and more like unsuccessful undertakers.
Nowadays, the marabou wears a threadbare black coat...
...and a holier-than-thou expression on his unlovely face.
They seem to look down their noses at everyone else...
...and always seem to be discussing...
...the follies and the sinfulness of the other animals.
The female ostrich is a dull gray, but the male is a handsome devil.
At mating time, the handsome boys flash their plumage to impress the girls.
And the less good-looking ones have to fight for their lady loves.
Finally, a loving couple will find a secluded spot...
...to do their beautiful mating dance.
Pretty soon, they start a family.
Actually, he's a better parent than she is.
And on a hot afternoon, she will join the rest of the gang at the water hole...
...leaving him to keep an eye on the nest.
This is a full-time job, because each egg is a whole meal...
...and there are many freeloaders in the Namib.
Meanwhile, back at the nest...
...young Oscar chooses this moment to get born.
There's no one to welcome him because Mother is out swimming...
...and Father is out fighting Hottentots.
Oscar feels very lonely, so he wobbles off to find company.
He is now only two minutes old, but already he knows about camouflage.
On the morning of his wedding day...
...the wart hog goes down to the water hole for a bath...
...because he wants to look nice for his bride-to-be.
That's enough.
Meanwhile, the young lady of his choice moves into his bachelor apartment...
...and immediately starts changing things.
He does a thorough job of grooming himself today...
...and she wants her future home to be just right.
And when he comes home, he begins to realize...
...that you have to make some adjustments to your lifestyle when you get married.
And there you have as handsome a couple of young newlyweds as you can hope to find.
The friendliest and the most affectionate little creatures...
...in the desert are the meerkats.
Sorry, fella.
They're also most inquisitive, and when a stranger intrudes...
...he's received with courtesy and friendly curiosity.
Even a poisonous cobra is inspected and invited to be friendly.
An egg is pure frustration.
He knows there's something good in there, but how do you get to it?
The mongoose looks like the meerkat, but he's from a different family.
When he finds an egg, he hikes it to the nearest rock...
...juggles it into position, takes a quick sighting, and shoots.
But the meerkat doesn't have the know-how.
He always digs for his food...
...so instinctively, he tries to solve this problem by digging.
But it doesn't work.
Maybe he can learn by watching the mongoose.
All right, he'll try that.
That guy makes it look so easy.
But the egg-eater snake...
...can swallow an egg
10 times as big as his head...
...without breaking it or his head.
He unhooks his lower jaw from the rest of his face...
...so he can open his mouth wide enough.
At first, the egg keeps slipping away, and he goes around in circles.
But he has a good reason for that.
Eventually, he has the egg surrounded so it can't slip away anymore.
And now he can do his trick.
Once the egg is safely inside him, he crushes it...
...and squeezes out all the good stuff without spilling a drop.
And a few minutes later, he ejects the shell in a neat, disposable package.
But if you want to swallow eggs whole, there's no room for teeth in your mouth.
That makes him the most defenseless snake in the world...
...so apparently, Mother Nature has played a nasty trick on him.
But to make up for it, she painted phony teeth on his lips...
...and she taught him to put up such an act of ferocity...
...that he can even intimidate an elephant.
That intricate winding movement makes him look twice his size...
...and lets his scales make an angry rasping sound as they rub together.
He pretends to strike viciously, but he has to make sure he misses...
...otherwise his enemy will find out that he has no teeth.
But his act is so good that no one ever calls his bluff...
...and everyone believes he's very dangerous.
A baboon will eat every creepy-crawly thing he can find under rocks...
...but if he should come across an egg-eater snake...
...he'll fall down in a dead faint.
And would you believe it, he looks under the same rock and faints again.
Sometimes he's sorry he got married, because she's always cleaning house.
He wants a girlfriend, and that's his way of advertising.
He knows if there's a lady tapping beetle within half a mile...
...she'll hear him and answer back.
So all day and all night, he taps and listens, taps and listens...
...because tapping beetles are scarce here...
...and he has a long and lonely quest ahead of him.
The backfiring beetle doesn't use his rear end for tapping. He uses it to defend himself.
His ammunition is a stinging acid, and he always hits his enemy right in the eye.
These are some of the animals who are at home in the Pre-Namib.
They've accepted the hardships of the changing planet and seem to enjoy...
...living in this arid land where the rain sometimes stays away for years.
In the southern part of the Pre-Namib, billions of seeds...
...lie waiting for years in the dust of the desert floor.
When the rain comes at last, a miraculous transformation happens.
The desert covers itself in a wall-to-wall carpet, and an incredible variety...
...of flowers celebrate the coming of the life-giving moisture.
For a few weeks, the Pre-Namib tries to recapture the glories of the past...
...when this was a paradise.
But the glory is short-lived.
The sun dehydrates the earth again, and the flowers return to dust.
But they leave billions of seeds in the desert soil...
...because the rain may come again, and they'll have another festival.
For now, the desert reverts to bleakness...
...and those few weeks of color seem as if they never happened.
There is one spot in the Pre-Namib that is a year-round paradise...
...because the Cubango River streams out of the Tropics.
Unlike other rivers, it never reaches the sea.
It blunders into the vastness of the desert and is swallowed.
But before those millions of gallons of water disappear under the sand...
...they create a luxuriant subtropical jungle in the middle of the desert.
A year-round Garden of Eden, complete with serpent and other predators.
The kingfisher pinpoints his target precisely...
...and gets into the exact position by moving this way and that.
Then he strikes.
Like a fighter pilot, he dives with the sun behind him so his prey can't see him coming.
At high noon, he goes straight down.
And later, when the sun is lower, he comes in at an angle.
Far below the lily pads, there's another paradise where life is mostly placid...
...with some hectic moments.
The bream has as many as a thousand babies at one time...
...and she has a very cute trick to protect them from predators.
Father keeps a lookout so he can warn Mother when danger comes.
Old snaggletooth comes prowling out of his lair, and Father nearly throws a fit.
He gives the alarm, so the kids beeline for Mother, who promptly swallows them...
...the whole thousand.
Whoops, little Wilbur is late.
Snaggletooth attacks once more.
"Hey, Mom, let me in, let me in!"
"Shucks!"
The villain gives up and leaves, so Dad gives the all clear, and Mother spits them out.
Most of the kids are happy to be free...
...but there are always some insecure sissies who want to go back inside where it's safe...
...and she cannot get rid of them.
"Go and play outside."
In the jungles and on the flood plains...
...on the banks of the Cubango...
...nobody needs to work, because there's plenty of water and food for everybody.
There's no day-to-day struggle for existence, and the animals enjoy a life...
...of peace and plenty.
One may wonder why animals in the surrounding desert don't flock...
...to share in this life of luxury.
Here, the trees and plants bear fruits and seeds and berries to suit every taste.
The seeds of the tambuti tree jump and cavort...
...because inside each one there's a little worm with the hiccups.
In paradise, even the worms are cute.
And in every tree, there's a whole parade of characters from every walk of life.
A lady with her hair in curlers.
A cross between a zebra and a vacuum cleaner.
A little dachshund, complete with waggly tail.
A dizzy blond with a painted face.
And other beautiful people.
A portly old gentleman in conservative gray.
The hobo.
The poor guy on skid row.
Longhaired hippie.
And the real far-out weirdo who does his own wild thing.
And, of course, the bloated, overfed, overdressed slob.
He illustrates what's wrong with living in paradise...
...because many members of this society have become blasé and bored with life.
Things are just too easy in the Cubango Basin.
They no longer have a zest for living like their cousins out in the inhospitable desert.
Here, life offers no challenge, and many of them have become slobs and easy riders.
The only excitement in their lives comes in high summer...
...when the marula trees are in full fruit.
At first, the marulas are very tasty and hard to get at.
You have to be either agile or strong to get your share.
After a few weeks, the marulas get overripe, and they start dropping from the trees.
Then all the animals wade in and gorge themselves on the rotting fruit.
It starts fermenting in their tummies and turns into a very potent brew.
On the way home, things start happening to them.
When night falls, there's peace again.
A very blissful peace.
Not everybody in the Cubango leads a wasteful life.
Some members of this too-prosperous society are still sober, hardworking folk.
The weavers here don't build condos like those in the White Namib.
Each one builds his own free-swinging nest.
To do that, he has to perform a small miracle.
He has no hands, only his little beak to make all those intricate knots.
So a newlywed is nervous when he builds his first nest under the watch of his bride.
When the job is done, he hops onto a twig and timidly invites his wife to inspect it.
She flits across and takes a long, hard look at her future home.
It doesn't look very neat, and she doesn't even like the neighborhood.
She's got to raise her kids in this?
"You like it, huh? You like it? Huh?"
She makes a closer inspection and subjects the house to testing...
...to see whether it conforms to her specifications, and he's in quite a flutter.
She's not satisfied and vents her fury on his substandard workmanship.
"You didn't like it, huh?"
"You bet your life I didn't like it."
He will try again, and this time he chooses the neighborhood carefully.
He's all of a twitter because she's watching.
First he has to tie two twigs together, but it's not easy. Those twigs are springy.
Oh, boy, it's not easy.
But if all those others can do it, he can too.
One day, he'll build a house he can be proud of...
...although he'll still get nervous when his wife comes to approve it.
The hornbill installs his wife inside a tree trunk and seals her up for three months.
But first he cleans out her cell to make sure she'll be comfortable in there.
Then he flies off to get some clay to wall her in, and she starts undressing.
She plucks out her coarser feathers so she can be soft for the chicks when they hatch.
Without those feathers, she can't fly, but she won't be using her wings for a while.
He comes back with a beakful of clay and blocks the entrance...
...so she and her chicks will be safe.
He leaves only a slit, the size and shape for a hornbill's bill...
...so he can bring her food and water while she lays and hatches her eggs.
And then there are suddenly five mouths to feed, and Father has to provide for them all.
Throughout the summer, he's the hardest-working member...
...of the opulent Cubango community.
When the chicks grow bigger he has to provide a balanced diet.
One day, green stuff with lots of vitamins.
The next day, proteins.
One lucky day, a swarm of proteins comes buzzing around the nest...
...saving Dad a lot of labor.
He's quite sorry when they leave.
Oh, well, back to the grind.
The chicks have been taught not to pollute their own nest, and their aim is remarkable.
As they grow, it gets crowded in the nursery.
So one fine day, Mother breaks open the roof, and out they come.
Father feels happy and proud to see his children at last...
...but perhaps he also feels sad and discarded.
Now they don't need him anymore.
Although wart hogs get as smashed...
...as everybody else during the marula binge...
...they lead exemplary lives for the rest of the year.
Family ties are strong, and the little ones are attached to their mother.
Of course, in every family there is always one unlucky one.
If there are any knocks coming, he gets them.
The cheetah is the fastest runner in the world...
...and if Mrs. Wart Hog is not alert, she can lose some of her family.
But she's quick to sense danger, and hogs are pretty fast on their feet too.
Each one finds a hole and pops in tail-first.
The unlucky one chooses a hole that's too small, and now he can get neither in nor out.
Luckless is trapped very far from home.
They say hogs can't count, but Mother knows that one of her children is missing.
At last, the frustrated cheetah goes away.
Mother searches every hole and behind every bush for her child.
She cannot rest before she finds him.
Luckless guesses it's safe to come out...
...and it dawns on him that he doesn't know the way home.
All night long, Mother keeps a vigil for her little lost one.
He's never slept alone, and in the middle of the night...
...some big animals come sniffing around.
He tries to lie very still and pretend he's only a stone...
...but he's very frightened.
When a baby wart hog gets separated from its mother, it'll try to find a substitute.
It's not easy to get yourself adopted...
...when you have a face that only your mother can love.
The only one who will adopt him is an old rotting log.
He's a very sad little boy.
When a honey badger is young, his parents abandon him...
...and he has to find his own food.
He's not an expert hunter yet.
He'll have to live on worms and grubs in this land of milk and honey...
...unless some fairy godmother comes to his aid.
Incredibly, nature provides just such a godmother in the shape of a little bird.
For a while, she looks on as he scratches and digs...
...for the few scraps of food he can find.
When the time is ripe, she introduces herself.
At first, he resents this noisy, fluttering nuisance, but eventually...
...some deep instinct makes him realize dimly that he has to follow her.
So she finally leads him to the objective:
A big, fat beehive.
All his instincts come to the surface.
He knows his favorite food is in there, and nothing will stop him.
His hide is impervious to bee stings. The only vulnerable spot is the tip of his nose.
At last, the payoff.
This amazing partnership of the honey guide bird and the badger...
...is an intriguing example of teamwork between different species.
He doesn't eat all the loot, because she's entitled to her share.
The inhabitants of the Cubango Basin...
...don't realize how lucky they are to be living in luxury.
To them, this land of plenty is the whole universe.
They're unaware that their bounteous habitat...
...is a small green world floating...
...in the vast emptiness of the Pre-Namib.
The Pre-Namib, again, is dwarfed by its neighbor on Capricorn, the Kalahari.
This is the most treacherous desert of all, because after the short rainy season...
...it looks like an immense paradise that can rival the opulence of the Cubango.
The grass is as high as an elephant's eye, and while the surface water lasts...
...everybody prospers.
At the water holes, there is so much traffic that all the grass is worn away.
Zebra in their thousands.
Graceful kudu, the males with beautiful horns...
...the females with beautiful ears.
Oryx, who, unlike their cousins in the Namib, revel in the abundant water.
Ostrich.
The fussy-looking secretary bird, who's very good at short takeoffs...
...but needs a heck of a long runway for landing.
The towering giraffe, who makes the zebra look like toys.
Some years there's even a vast shallow lake for a short while after the rain...
...where water birds converge in great numbers.
The lake covers 8000 square miles, but it's only a few inches to a few feet in depth.
And most years, a great flock of pelicans establish...
...their breeding colony in the middle of the lake.
They look stodgy and comical on the ground and pompous in the air.
But on water, they have style and elegance.
They gather in flotillas to herd fish into the shallows...
...where they dip in a graceful ballet to collect food for their chicks.
But the lake and the many water holes are impermanent.
Soon the water will sink away into the Kalahari sand...
...and there'll be a long, grim wait of nine months or more...
...before the rain comes again.
The only human beings...
...in the deep Kalahari are a few Bushmen.
They don't live in tribes, but roam about in small family groups.
The region is so vast that one family hardly ever meets another.
They must be the most carefree and contented people in the world...
...because they own nothing.
In the desert, there's nothing you can own, but everything you need.
They're also the most gentle people, possibly because they've never seen...
...anything as hard as a rock or a stone in their lives.
Where they live, there's only sand and trees and grass and animals.
So their tools are made of leather or bone or wood.
They never experience anything harder than wood.
When they find food, they eat it all at one sitting...
...so they have very expandable stomachs.
When they sleep, their heads never touch the ground...
...because there are crawly things in the sand that can get into their ears.
They dig their elbows into the soft sand and use their shoulders as pillows.
The children have to have an intimate understanding of the animals around them.
So the elders teach them, in stereophonic sound yet.
But somehow the children manage to listen to two teachers at once.
They are superb mimics, and they feel a close affinity...
...with the animals who are their neighbors and also their food.
The Bushman is a very small man, and his weapons are puny.
He has to sneak up very close to his food...
...because his arrow can only kill at 30 paces.
The biggest nuisance in his life is the go-away bird...
...who seems to take pleasure in sabotaging him.
It'll watch him stalking painstakingly up to his quarry...
...and then tell it to go away.
Such beautiful targets.
When the water holes begin to grow smaller, the animals get restless.
Soon they'll have to move away, leaving all that beautiful grass uneaten.
They're loath to leave this bountiful food supply...
...and they'll hang on until the last of the water disappears.
Fights break out easily, and when two oryx bulls lose their tempers...
...the outcome can be fatal, so the leader of the herd will try to make peace.
Those horns are like rapiers, and the oryx use them like expert swordsmen.
The peacemaker's efforts are not very successful.
He only succeeds in goading them further.
With a sudden jab, one gets his horn into position for the fatal thrust.
If he can drive that horn in a few more inches, he'll go right to the heart.
When things get too hot, the loser breaks and runs.
He'll live to fight another day.
The smaller water holes dry up first...
...but sometimes there's plenty of water below the sand.
You just have to know where to dig.
But elephants are finicky, and this water stinks.
The royal family has its own water supply, and when it runs low...
...a young female always gets the job of keeping all the other animals away.
She has to work out there on the hot plain while the rest of the family...
...take it easy in the shade.
She grew fat and lazy during the affluent season...
...and finds it a very tedious assignment.
One pesky impala in particular makes her life a misery.
The strange thing is that the impala doesn't really need the water.
He can get enough moisture by licking the dew off the grass...
...in the early morning.
Maybe he gets up too late, or maybe he just likes to pester her for the hell of it.
Of course, lion is king only until elephants make the scene...
...even if they're only youngsters.
The Bushman is not dependent on water holes.
His forebears have had thousands of years to adapt to the Kalahari...
...so he needs very little liquid, and he knows where to find it.
An insignificant-looking dry twig tells him where to dig.
Anyone else would die of thirst in a few days...
...in this treacherous desert that doesn't look like a desert...
...but he can survive for months on end.
He unearths a bulbous root...
...which is really just a solid lump of wood with hard fibers that are merely damp.
Civilized man would need some pretty complicated technology...
...and machinery to get water out of it, but he uses the very simplest of tools.
His scraper is a stick that has been split to give it a sharp edge...
...and he produces some dry-looking shavings.
But you take a handful, point your thumb at your mouth...
...squeeze very hard and wait for it.
The baboons always have a secret supply of water...
...and they're not going to tell anybody where it is.
And when a Machalahari ventures into the deep Kalahari...
...on a hunting trip, he has to find water...
...because, unlike the Bushman, he doesn't know how to make liquid from a root.
But he has his own way of finding out where the water is.
First, he drills a hole in a giant ant heap when he's sure a baboon is watching him...
...because he knows baboons are incurably inquisitive.
Next, he puts some wild melon seeds into the hole...
...and works them in so that they drop into a hollow.
Then he saunters off, knowing the baboon is burning with curiosity.
The baboon doesn't trust that human being at all, so he plays it cool.
But he's dying to know what gives in that confounded hole.
Finally, Mr. Inquisitive can't take it any longer.
He's got to know what's in there.
He reaches in, grabs a fistful, and now his hand's too big to come out.
If he had the sense to drop the seeds, he could free his hand.
Now he lets go when it's too late.
So that was a smart enough way to catch a baboon...
...but he still has to make him talk.
Now, he knows that salt is very scarce in this particular area...
...and that baboon is going to eat those lumps like candy.
In fact, he has such a ball eating salt that he completely forgets he's under arrest...
...and that in a little while he's going to be a mighty thirsty baboon.
Next morning, the Machalahari goes to have a closer look...
...to see whether his prisoner is ready to talk.
He decides the brainwashing has worked, so he sets him free...
...knowing that in his condition he won't care who follows him...
...to the secret reservoir.
The Machalahari has no eyes for the beauty of the setting.
To him, water is beautiful.
Now the water holes have dried up to only a trickle...
...and soon that will be hard-baked soil.
In a few short weeks, paradise turns into purgatory.
The merciless sun scorches down, and dust devils dance...
...across the parching earth.
Most of the animals migrate to other regions...
...but some hardy and some foolhardy ones remain.
And the vultures know that their prosperous time is approaching.
By this time, the great lake has dried up completely...
...into a boundless, white expanse.
Mummified fish lie scattered on the dry, cracked surface.
Animals migrating across the lake from the Kalahari...
...plod through cruel mirages of water that doesn't splash under their feet...
...and they pass phantom trees that offer no shade.
After days of plodding, some begin to panic...
...when there seems to be no end to the vastness.
Some just give up and stop walking.
Some years, the drought comes too soon for the pelicans...
...who nested in the center of the lake.
The parents stand around helplessly as their little black chicks...
...suffer agonies of hunger and thirst and heat.
They're almost fully grown, but are still too young to fly...
...so they're trapped in this boundless desolation.
One little one begins to walk blindly away into the searing heat...
...and his parents can only look on in despair.
In the first weeks of his life, this was a bountiful lake.
He cannot understand how his beautiful world could change into this pitiless void.
So he walks and walks, hoping in despair to find his beautiful world again...
...somewhere in this vast emptiness.
In the evening, cool, moist air...
...comes drifting into the desert, bringing a promise of life-giving rain.
In the morning, the clouds are still streaming into the desert sky...
...but the sun burns mercilessly, and one by one...
...they shrivel in the searing heat.
A few stragglers survive, but as they penetrate deeper into the desert...
...they, too, dwindle and fade.
In the end, the parents have to abandon their chicks...
...and fly away to the sea.
And the chicks begin to walk.
They are very weak now, and the dried-out lake is endless.
It is a death march that leaves a trail of little bodies...
...for mile upon mile on the vastness...
...until only a pitiful few are left alive.
Far away from the desert, the clouds build up into towering masses...
...as they prepare to invade the stronghold of the sun once more.
Like a liberating army, wave after wave of cumulus...
...surges across the African plains.
Even before they reach the desert, the sun begins to pound down on the upper layers...
...and it tears great gaps in the ranks of the invaders.
But when the advance guard reaches the desert, it is still a formidable force.
It penetrates several miles into the desert...
...and some clouds even discharge their load of rain.
But the rain never reaches the ground because the relentless sun evaporates...
...the water before it can fall on the thirsting earth.
The invasion loses impetus under the fury of the sun...
...and the clouds are vanquished.
And the surviving chicks wait in vain for relief from their anguish.
By nightfall, only a few scattered remnants drift around aimlessly.
During the night, the clouds regroup their forces.
Great masses move around in the darkness like vast engines of war...
...as they maneuver into position for another invasion.
At dawn, they launch another massive attack.
Again, wave after wave sweeps towards the desert.
And in the turmoil of a titanic battle of the elements, the sun is finally obliterated.
Then there is a great hush.
Strangely, when deliverance comes at last, the animals show no signs of rejoicing.
They merely wait impassively for the rain to pass.
And after a few minutes, it stops.
Abruptly and suddenly.
The thirsty earth soaks up the long-awaited moisture.
But in the rocky parts, the water runs off and brings new perils.
The flash floods drain off as suddenly as they started.
And now the desert can settle down to enjoy the return of prosperity.
But still the animals show no sign of rejoicing.
It takes several days before it dawns on them that...
...paradise has returned to the desert.
Then their joy of living comes bursting out.

Good morning! It's one minute to five, and it's a beautiful day.
It's time for me to go.
Catch you tomorrow night-
- with the latest and greatest in country music.
All you truck-drivers, late-nighters and early risers - remember:
What you see is what you get.
This is Ashley Wallace...
Thanks for keeping me company.
ABBA - the hottest property on the pop scene.
They sell sixty million records around the world.
- ABBA?
- Yep. How does this grab you:
"Radio 2TW will present, on the night of their departure from these shores"-
- "a two hour ABBA radio special.
For the first time"-
- "your favourite country and western host turns ace reporter."
That's really not my bag, is it?
Come on, it's a good challenge.
Take it!
We want ABBA!
I know it's a rush, but I want it on air 7.30 the night they leave.
That gives you one week.
What about Lenny?
I mean, Lenny handles the pop scene.
Lenny's not on. He's too slick, he's too superficial.
I want an exclusive, in-depth interview with the people themselves.
ABBA, the people. The real people.
We want ABBA!
I want an interview.
I want a gut-level dialogue.
An exclusive, gut-level... dialogue.
You know what I mean?
You don't want me to interview...
You don't want me to interview them?
- You want me to just have a chat?
- Come on. You know what I mean.
Yeah... But...
Get inside their heads. I don't want to know what they have for breakfast.
I want to know what they think, what they feel, what they fear...
- What they hate!
- Sure. Right. I understand.
We want ABBA!
Listen... The pop scene's never been touched like this before.
Really?
We want ABBA!
I mean... It's a good idea.
I mean, about not sort of being an interview.
A slice of life. Got me?
We want ABBA!
Good on you, Ash, my boy.
Your deadline's the night that ABBA departs these shores.
- 7.30 tonight week.
- Right. Okay. Good.
Go.
Go - right.
We want ABBA!
Are you sure you want me to do this documentary?
Don't use that word.
It's not a documentary, it's an event!
This is going to be worldwide.
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Lots of cameras around.
What do you want us to do?
- What's all this?
- I don't know.
Hello!
A little wave.
Excuse me, pal... Do you know what time ABBA are arriving?
- 9 o'clock, I think.
- Where are they coming through?
I really don't know.
You all right?
All right... See you!
Excuse me, what time are ABBA coming through?
- They've gone out the back door.
- The back door?
But I have to interview them.
You'll just have to wait for the press conference, won't you?
- It's on in half an hour.
- Do you know where?
ABBA wishes to thank their supporters for coming- and are sorry they cannot see them.
- I'd like to rent a car, please.
- Do you have a reservation?
No, I don't, but... just any car.
Any car, as long as it's fast.
And now we take you back to the ABBA press conference.
Here they are - ABBA.
They've finally hit Australia for their long-awaited tour.
- What?!
- ABBA, the pop group.
- Do you know where they're staying?
- Who?
The pop group - ABBA.
Do you know where they're staying?
Any performer gets very nervous before going on stage.
Do you still go through that traumatic experience before you go on stage?
Every show is a bit nervous before you...
You think you have a good performance-
- because you had a good audience the day before.
But going from Amsterdam to London-
- or from London to Sydney, is such a difference.
I'd hate the sound of 30,000 people booing.
Excuse me, is this the right jam for King's Cross?
- No, it's back that way.
- Thanks.
I think the travelling is very very hard.
Come on!
One day when I woke up during our European tour...
...I started to think "Where am I?
In which city?" And it's terrible.
I think that it's a bit of an asocial life on tour.
You just eat, sleep, go on stage, and nothing more.
And it kills creativity in a way that I don't like.
It's boring to travel, but it's fantastic to be on stage. I love that.
- Move!
- The biggest pop group ever...
The groups arrival in Australia has been accompanied by a blaze of publicity.
According to the promoters
They are bigger than The Beatles.
And with an entourage of 105 people-
- they are almost twice as big as The Rolling Stones concert.
While they are here they’ll perform eleven concerts in ten days- to a nest, mated 140000 people.
ABBA are obviously very big business-
- and the organizers are treating them like royalty.
They’ve even arranged a civic reception for them in Melbourne.
Do you take drugs or alcohol, or anything like that?
- No drugs.
- You're clean?
No, not clean, but we don't take any drugs.
The four of you admit that you are now millionaires.
Are you worried that you make money faster than you can spend it?
No. It's a lot of money coming in, but there's a lot of tax to pay-
- if you're a Swedish citizen, which is fair. But still, it's...
It's a matter of hard work, and the money isn't that important.
Really, it's more a matter of pleasing yourselves in what you're doing.
We can't do anything else in the future-
- than trying to keep ourselves happy in our work.
I' d like to direct a couple of questions to Agnetha if I may...
I read somewhere w here you are the proud owner of an award-
- which declares you as the lady with the sexiest bottom.
Is that true?
How can I answer that?
I don't know.
I haven't seen it!
Thank you ABBA. Thank you ladies and gentlemen of television.
Excuse me.
Do you know where ABBA are?
- I think they've left.
- They've left... They've gone?
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Have you filmed the umbrellas out there? It's a fantastic sight.
Agnetha, I have...
...four kilos of make-up.
- Is the make-up artist here?
- Where could she be...?
- She'll come if you ask her.
Don't go out and get your hair wet, okay?
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Because the only thing I'm worried about is that the power just stops.
The opening?
Just walk out there.
I don't think there's much we can do, really, with the wind and the rains...
There's not a lot we can do.
We want ABBA!
Ten minutes to the show of a lifetime!
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner and try not to scream
It's me
I am behind you,
I always find you,
I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me,
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you,
I always find you,
I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me,
I am the tiger
The city is a prison, you never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape
Of me
I am behind you,
I'll always find you,
I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me,
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you,
I'll always find you,
I am the tiger
And if I meet you, what if I eat you,
I am the tiger, tiger, tiger!
Thank you!
All right. All right.
- Can I see your press card, please?
- I haven't got my card on me.
I'm sorry, but I can't let you in if you haven't got a card. Okay.
But I'm a radio announcer.
I've got to get an interview with them.
There's nothing I can do. If you haven't got a card, you can't get in.
- I'll buy a ticket. How much are they?
- Sold right out.
I haven't got one left.
I'm very sorry.
Hello, Sydney!
Very glad to see you!
I'll tell you one thing:
You make us forget the rain.
I just hope that we can make you forget it, too!
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seemed so far away though you were standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
ABBA tickets for sale... ABBA tickets going cheap. Want any tickets, mate?
- Want any ABBA tickets?
- Are you selling tickets?
- How much? I'll buy one.
- 50 bucks.
50 dollars? I haven't got 50 dollars.
You ain't gonna see ABBA then, are you?
Money, money, money
Must be funny in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny in the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same
Money, money, money
Must be funny in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny in the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
Money, money, money
Must be funny in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny in the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
Thank you, Sydney!
The Sydney Opera House?
They should be there, mate, that's what they reckon.
Terrific. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Could you... hold this?
Could you, sort of, hold it in the middle?
Let's have a smile.
Down. Lower! Down a bit.
That's it.
- Happy now.
- What do you mean, "happy"?
Excuse me...
Is it possible to have a talk?
Not now.
Go somewhere and have a quiet talk?
I know that this is an incredible hassle for you... with all these people.
I can understand these problems that you have-
- but if we can go somewhere quiet...
Have a drink or something to eat.
Go back. Press photographers only.
- Can we go somewhere quiet...?
- You can't go anywhere with them.
No interviews today at all, it's just press photographers.
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying
I heard someone saying
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going (that we're going)
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
Love him, that's the only way
Yeah, yeah, sure. Everything's fine.
There's no need to worry.
I met them at the airport, we spoke for quite a long time...
Yes. Yes. There's just one thing:
- I have to go to Perth.
- Perth?
That's 2,000 miles and a very expensive airfare away.
Yes, I know that, but you wanted the close personal story, and they...
That's the way it has to be.
I have to get to know them.
They have to trust me.
I want every listener on 2TW to share ABBA with you-
- and me and all of us, privately.
Right?
Don't worry.
I'll get the personal side.
No, no, no. I'll be able to edit and record as I go.
I've already got some interviews in the street-
- some comments on people, how they feel about the group. Yeah.
Oh! Also...
Could you send my press card to Perth?
I left in such a rush that I left it in the studio.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
Could I...
Can I have these two T-shirts, please.
I'll take this as well. Thank you.
Thank you.

Why do you like ABBA?
I suppose it's... It has a good beat.
It's got good rhythm,
I think the lyrics are good.
I think it's appealing to all people.
When a little baby of about eighteen months can say "ABBA"-
- and recognize the pictures and recognize the music...
...I think it even appeals to the very, very young as well, you see.
What do you like most about their music?
Well, I like the clean-cut beat of the music...
- Just the beat?
- No, the beat...
And the clean-cut appearance of them.
They're a fantastic group.
What do you think of their...?
...because I think they're nice and clean.
- What do you mean by that?
- They've always dressed nicely...
...and tidy. I think that's what we all like, the older people.
I don't know about the kids, but we do, anyway.
It's a bit quieter than the more modern ones at the moment.
Not quite as loud.
Well, they look tidy on stage, even though they have nice costumes.
Some of the groups today look positively ugly on stage.
I think they appeal to the young children, too.
Perth Wednesday interview number five:
What do you like most about their music?
Make me very happy.
Make me wanna get up, and dance.
- And... Just everything.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank...
- Are you an ABBA fan?
- Not particularly. I hate them.
I've got a 12-year-old ABBA nut.
He's got the records and posters.
The house is full of them.
It's as much as a man can stand.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
- Hi. Has my press card arrived yet?
- Just a moment, sir.
No, I'm sorry.
There's no mail at all for you.
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA!
Look, can't you see I'm a journalist?
But you haven't got a press card, and we're all sold out.
There's nothing I can do, I'm sorry.
Excuse me. I'm doing some interviews.
Are you an ABBA fan?
- Yes, I am.
- What do you like about the group?
Well... They're a clean-cut group...
...with nice music and a nice beat.
That's great. Fantastic.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me...
Do you know where ABBA are?
- Yes, they're straight through there.
- Good. Thank you.
Very nice.
- What do you think you're doing here?
- L-l-I've...
...got an interview...
- Who with?
- ABBA!
- Who said?
- Stig Anderson, their manager.
- Well, show me your press pass.
- You haven't got a press pass.
- Well, I have, but I...
You haven't got an interview either, have you?
- Out!
- But listen...

You’re gonna feel so fine
You’ll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You’re something I’d been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I’ll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I’ve been waiting for you
Oh, I’ve been waiting for you
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I’ve been waiting for you
I’ve been waiting for you
ABBA - which floor?
Number 5, but you haven't got a chance!
That's okay, I'm a professional.
- The Sydney reviews.
- Thank you.
Would you give me that one, please.
- What does "kinky" mean?
- Kinky? It's a...
...sort of a perversion.
Usually sexual perversion.
What do they find kinky?
- "ABBA's kinky, velvet bed."
- "Velvet" what?
- Velvet bed.
- Bed.
"This is the giant bed
Agnetha and Bjorn ordered"-
"to be ready at the hotel."
"And the manager made sure their dressing-gowns were ready"-
"when the super group arrived."
What a kinky journalist.
Your bottom was the best thing in the show.
- "Agnetha's bottom tops show!"
- Oh, my God...
Don't they have bottoms in Australia?
"'Damn! ', a middle-aged man beside me said with feeling."
"It's really something worth seeing."
I suppose he thought that was a very funny headline.
At least I did something for the show, didn,t I?
Nah, nah, nah.
None of that stuff here, okay?
No, it's okay.
I've got an appointment.
I have an appointment...
I've got an appointment with them.
Nah.
That's a really interesting sound you're making. I collect funny sounds.
- Would you like to do it in there?
- Nah, nah.
Thank you. I think I've got it.
Nah, nah. Cut that shit out.
Look, there's no need to shove!
That was pretty dangerous for a while, wasn't it? The rain on the stage?
- No, not really.
- You were very lucky.
- You didn't hurt yourself.
- Yes, really.
Excuse me.
Cut it out!
Listen, pal.
I ought to shove this microphone-
- so far down your throat I could record your stomach talking to you...
Haven't I seen enough of you today?
Guided tour is this way!
This is known as an elevator. It goes up and down, and you're going down.
Benny!
Bjorn!
THE NAME OF THE GAME
I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
I was an impossible case
No-one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know..
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know..
The name of the game
I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited
Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know..
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know..
Oh yes I wanna know..
The name of the game
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Hello?
Good morning!
Everything is going really well here.
Everything's fine.
There's just one small problem.
I have to tag along with them to Adelaide.
Adelaide...
Ever-Lovin' Adelaide is taking a chance with you, Ashley.
Listen, you don't have to worry.
I know them all quite well...
...but the time is not ripe yet for an interview.
I'm trying to remain friends with you, but you're making it bloody difficult!
They have to have confidence in me.
It's too early.
Do you know what I mean?
All right, go to Adelaide.
But please, Ashley, get that dialogue we spoke of!
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.
The dialogue!
Oh, the dialogue! Yes.
The dialogue...
That's exactly why I wanted to wait.
0h... Just one more thing.
My press card.
Can you send it on to Adelaide?
Great. Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Shortly we will be landing in Adelaide.
Please fasten your seatbelts-
- and make sure that your seat is in an upright position.
They have a very distinctive, a very individual sound-
- which is all their own, which is very difficult for others to copy.
The girls' voices have their own special sound.
They utilize the technical facilities of a studio to the utmost.
I believe it was an English critic that commented that if you took-
- an ABBA song apart and laid all the different pieces, out before you-
- there would be only one way to put the song back together again-
- and that's the way, of course, that they had originally done it.
- Okay...
- It's inflated.
- I thought it would hang...
- It's like a cloud.
- It looks good.
- It's a really good roof.
What do you like about their songs?
It's got type of... a feeling that, you know, you're happy.
I just like them. I don't know why I do.
I just like them.
There's nothing really special about them.
They're only human beings...
Except their music.
That's what's special.
Right. Listen, I just want to recheck with you on the arrival arrangements- in Melbourne on Saturday morning.
Start with violins and then the chellos.
There's only two violas.
Somebody, give me a hand with this.
Very comfortable! Very comfortable.
Their image is very clean-
- and it does provide a large contrast to a great number of popular groups.
They don't have anything to do with chains and violence.
Their music and their performance has to do with having a good time.
I think most parents react very favourably to ABBA.
At the concerts amongst the public-
- you see sometimes two even three generations of a family.
Just a small portion.
Could you rip it off please!
I think it would be very wise if you all slow ed down a little bit-
- and just took your time and s at down. There is plenty of room.
Well they are not like other groups you know that get up-
- and sort of go crazy play their guitars and shake their heads.
- Thanks very much.
- 0kay.
ABBA books and posters! 75 cents each!
ABBA buttons!
Get your ABBA buttons here!
- I don’t much...
- What don’t you like about ABBA?
- They show off too much.
- How do they show off?
They just wear too many...
They just wear too many clothes.
And too much make-up. That's all.
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Why Did It Have To Be Me
When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
Men are toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw them away
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
Well, I like them...
...very much.
They are very nice people.
Would you like to tell me why you like ABBA?
Because I sing it...
- I'm sorry. Could you tell me again?
- I sing it.
You sing it?
I like the songs, and it's really good.
What do you like about the songs?
The parts that are good.
What parts are good?
The songs are good, because their names are good.
And one of the men is sexy, you know.
They look sexy.
- Do you think ABBA are sexy?
- Uh-uh. Nice.
So do I. I think they're nice, but it's a bit sexy.
- Sexy?!
- Sexy...
..... taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn¨t quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
And I couldn´t help it,
I just had to kiss the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
Hey,
I'll tell you something about ABBA!
Do you know that ABBA's in the Bible?
It means "father".
- It's in Mark.
- I didn't know that.
The Gospel according to St. Mark.
Chapter 16.
"Abba the Father", it says. He told me.
I thought he was pulling my leg.
It's right in there. A-b-b-a.
Abba - Father.

- For sure?
- I'll get to talk to them?
- Okay. Bye-bye.
From concert to concert from town to town as though her whole world was spinning
She got what she wanted, and yet she feels like a marionette!
You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around, refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette,
'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall
Can't complain,
I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane
Look this way, just a little smile, is what they say
You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay!!
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette,

I'm a marionette

Okay, and we change across.
Down again. One, two, three, four.
Last time.
One, two, three, four.
So sit down please. There are a lot of children behind you-
- who want to en joy this concert as much as you. Don’t you?
It is time to get your rocks on!
First row, right? Thank you.
Every body on stage!
All right! Ten minutes and away we go!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Thank you. Thank you so much.
- I'm goanna talk to them tomorrow.
- Really?
- Yeah. Interview them.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

Be good, be good...
You’ve been sitting for a long time now so its about time you got up-
- because were gonna play a dancing number for you - "Dancing Queen".
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music’s high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You’re in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
You’re a teaser, you turn ’em on
Leave them burning and then you’re gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You’re in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen
Why the hell didn't you wake me up?
...and music, dancing and singing.
Just like we do here in Moomba for the Moomba Festival.
Let's get together and have fun!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
The Moomba Festival presents the last appearance of ABBA in Australia.
- I suppose they've gone already?
- Who?
- ABBA.
- They just left for the airport.
- They've just...
- They've just gone.
...for the airport?
- I'm afraid so.
Is there anyone else you wish to speak to?
You're beautiful.
Testing one, two. Testing one, two...
Aaaaaah!
So long, see you honey
You can’t buy me with your money
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy
But I’ll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can’t buy me with your money
You know it’s not worth trying
So long, so long, so long
So long, see you honey
You can’t buy me with your money
You know it’s not worth trying
So long, so long, so long
- Thank you.
- We love you!
Goodbye!
Mr. Wallace...
Your press card's arrived.
Keep it. It's yours.
Excuse me... I'd just like to...
Can I have a... an interview...?
- Sure.
- Lf I can just... get this...
If you just...
"Eagle"
They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
And I dream I'm an eagle.
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
High, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please 
That was absolutely fantastic.
Thank you very much!
I have got everything I need.
That's just great.
Fantastic. Thank you.
It's been a pleasure meeting you.
You're fantastic.
Have a nice trip home! Thank you.
Love you, buddy boy!
Righto, see you soon.
We made it!
Not now...
Radio 2... Radio 2TW, and make it fast.
Right. Hang on to your hat.
- What are you up to?
- Radio special on ABBA.
ABBA?
You're not with that mob, are you?
Strewth. I took the wife and kids to see them the other night.
Bloody terrible it was.
Cost me a fortune.
I thought it'd be the nicest, cleanest show I could take the wife and kids to.
Not on your life, mate!
They came dancing out on stage- all dolled up in these white cloaks.
And before you know it, they rip half their clothes off!
And instead of facing the audience with the microphones in their hand...
And this sheila had on the tightest pair of white slacks you ever saw.
...she suddenly turns her back on the audience and starts flapping her...
You know what I mean. Starts flashing at the audience. Doing this sort of thing.
Can you drive a bit faster?
I can't hear you.
Could you please move a little.
People were so nice, you know, and we had a really good time.
We've had such a good time, and I'd really like thank everybody- for supporting us so much.
There she was with what they say is the most beautiful bottom in Europe.
I've seen a few bottoms in my time,
I guess it was pretty nice.
We're both red-blooded males.
I quite admired it in a way-
- because I can take that sort of thing, but not in front of the wife and kids!
And it's not the sort of thing you want to go flashing at them.
Not in front of, literally, thousands of little kids. Flashing it away there.
Goodbye!
- "I am a tiger..."
- Keep the change.
What sort of a song is that?
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Just in time, Ashley.
- In studio 2.
- Right!
- Hi.
- We thought you'd never make it.
Neither did I.
- Okay. I'll go and tell Jim.
- Thanks.
- Benny...
- A pleasure working with you.
- See you again.
- Bye-bye. All the best.
- All right.
- Practice the outside inside, all right?
- Practice the inside outside.
- I'll practice some of it.
Thank you. This is a crazy thing, you know - leaving everything.
This is Ashley Wallace, back from Sydney...
...Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, with...
...a two-hour special, including an exclusive, on-the-spot interview- with those super-Swedes, ABBA.
There’s nothing really special about them.
They’re only human beings...
- Are we on the air?
- Everything’s okay.
- We're on the air...
- Except their music. That’s special.
We're on the air!
I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it,
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it,
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
I've been so lucky,
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it,
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
So I say
Thank you for the music,
For giving it to me

All right.
And happy Thanksgiving.
' Well, baby, don't you do it
' Don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
' Please, don't do it, don't you break my heart
' My biggest mistake was loving you too much
' And letting ya know
' Now you got me where you want me
' And you won't let me go
' lf my heart was made of glass
' Well, then you'd surely see
' Heartaches and misery
' You been causin' me

' Don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
' Please don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Good night. Goodbye.
(Robertson) OK, look.
We've been together 16 years.
- (Martin Scorsese) Who?
- Who?
The Band.
- You want me to plug that in?
- Let's do it again.
The Band has been together 16 years.
Together on the road.
We did eight years in bars, dives, dance halls.
Eight years of concerts and stadiums, arenas.
We gave our final concert,
The Band's final concert, and we called it The Last Waltz.
Why was it held in San Francisco, in Winterland, when you guys have been on the road for 16 years?
Winterland was the first place that the band played as The Band.
Some friends showed up and helped us take it home.
Not just friends. They're more than that.
Would you ask me that again?
They weren't just friends. They weren't just friends who came in to say hello.
You know what l mean? Get that fly!
No. They were more than just friends. l feel they're probably some of the greatest influences on music on a whole generation.
We wanted it to be more than just a concert. We wanted it to be a celebration.
Celebration of a beginning or an end?
Beginning of the beginning of the end of the beginning.
- (Levon Helm) Good evening.

' When l get off of this mountain

' Yodel yodel yodel oooh lt was kind of... We didn't know where we were going, we didn't know what it was.
But, for some reason, it seemed like a good idea.
We got to this place, a joint, in Fort Worth, Texas. lt was burned out, bombed out. The roof wasn't even on the place any more.
And that's when they decided to call it the Skyline Lounge.
And we got there and set up and...
A big place.
Huge. Bar, way at the back and a big dance floor.
- Real old.
- So we set up the first night.
We go down to the place to play.
We go in and, in this huge place, there's about three people in the audience.
A one-armed go-go dancer and a couple of drunk waiters.
- A couple here, a couple there.
- Somebody fires a tear gas...
And a fight starts.
There isn't enough people in the place to get angry.
And we found out a few years later that it was Jack Ruby's club.

16 years ago, when we started, we started with a guy you might have heard of.
We'd like to start with him.
The Hawk! Ronnie Hawkins!
He called me up and l said
''Sure l'd like a job.
What does it mean? What do l do?''
He said ''You won't make much money but you'll get more pussy than Sinatra.''
' Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley, have you heard?
' Baby's gonna buy me a mockingbird
Whooooo!

' Who do you love?

And the week went on and it was a little depressing.
And it was especially depressing cos we didn't have any money at all. No dough.
(Danko) At one point, we had no more food money. lt got to the point where, coming from
Canada, we had these overcoats, big overcoats with pockets and everything, and we had a little routine.
We'd go to the shopping centre, all together.
- But l stayed home, right?
- No, you didn't. l got the cigarettes. l turned the cigarette machine upside down and got everybody some cigarettes.
- Yeah, but that was on the...
- You got me some baloney.
We'd go to the supermarket and a couple of people would buy a couple of loaves of bread, cos that was about the cheapest thing you could get.
And the rest of us would be carousing the aisles, stuffing baloney. lt'd be time to leave, the guy with the loaves would go to the checkout and we'd say ''We'll meet you at the car. You take the bread out.''
- Ya'll come back!
- And with these overcoats...
' And it makes no difference where l turn
' l can't get over you and the flame still burns
' And it makes no difference, night or day
' The shadow never seems to fade away
' And the sun don't shine any more
' And the rains fall down on my door
' Well, these old love letters
' Well, l just can't keep them
' Cos, like the gambler says
' Read 'em and weep
' And the dawn don't rescue me no more
' Without your love l have nothing at all
' Like an empty hall, it's a lonely fall
' Since you've been gone, it's a losing battle
' Stampeding cattle they rattle the walls
' And the sun don't shine any more
' And the rains fall down on my door
' Well, l love you so much
' And it's all l can do
' Just to keep myself from telling you
' That l never felt so alone before

That's what The Last Waltz is. l mean, 16 years on the road.

Well, we were The Hawks.
Everything was fine.
We were sailing along.
And all of a sudden, one day, The Hawks meant something else altogether. lt was right in the middle of that whole psychedelia.
''Chocolate Subway''. ''Marshmallow
Overcoat''. Those kind of names.
When we were working with Bob Dylan and we moved to Woodstock, everybody referred to us as The Band.
He called us The Band. Our friends and neighbours called us The Band.
And we started out with The Crackers.
We tried to call ourselves The Honkies.
Everybody kind of backed off from that, you know? lt was too straight.
So we decided just to call ourselves The Band.
' l pulled into Nazareth just feeling 'bout half-past dead

A dream come true.
Fascinating. Scary.
Kind of hard to take the first time.
You have to go there about two or three times before you can fall in love with it.
But that happens eventually.
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street.
The title of the hotel, it sounded like it was conveniently located in midtown Manhattan.
What did we know? We came out of the hotel after checking in, and you think ''lt's great to be back in New York.''
Movie theatres for ever.
All these friendly women walking up and down the street. lt was... lt was great.
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion. lt was an adult dose.
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.
You just go in the first time and you get your ass kicked and you take off.
As soon as it heals up, you come back and you try it again.
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.
Roulette Records was in the middle of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.
The songwriting capital of the world.
And we met some of the greatest songwriters ever.
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus.
Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.
They were all then.
Carole King. Neil Diamond.
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter was the low man on the totem pole.
But then, these people...
And here come the '60s, with change and revolution and war and assassinations, and a whole other frame of mind coming along.
And these songwriters were expressing the feelings of people in the street. ln a way, it was kind of the beginning of the end of Tin Pan Alley.
' Dry your eyes
' Take your song out

' Dry your eyes

' Sing it like you always wanted
' Like you sung it once before

' To the midst of the waiting crowd

' And come dry your eyes
' And he taught us more about living
' Than we ever cared to know
' And we came to learn the secret
' And we never let it go
' And it was more than being holy
' Though it was less than being free
' And if you can't recall the reason
' Can you hear the people sing?
' Right through the lightning and the thunder
' To the dark side of the moon
' To that distant falling angel
' That descended much too soon
' Come dry your eyes

- (cheering and applause)
- Thanks very much.
When you started playing as The Band, you shied away from publicity a lot.
Talk about that a little.
That was just part of a lifestyle that we got to love in Woodstock.
We got to like it, you know, just being able to chop wood or hit your thumb with a hammer.
We'd be concerned with fixing a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.
Stuff like that.
And getting the songs together.
We always seemed to get a whole lot more done when we didn't have a lot of company around.
We were more productive.
And as soon as company came, of course, we'd start having fun.
You know what happens when you have too much fun.
Something we've kind of evaded around here, but l'll ask it now.
- What about women and the road?
- l love 'em.
That's probably why we've been on the road.
- That's it.
- Not that l don't like the music. l thought you weren't supposed to talk about it too much.
- No, l guess we're not.
- l thought we were supposed to... pan away from that sort of stuff, get into something else.
Since the beginning, since we started playing together, just like we've all grown just a little bit, so have the women.
- You know? And it's amazing.
- That's right. That's good. l just wanna break even.
(Robertson) Joni Mitchell. Right.

Levon's home town, it's near West Helena.
One time we were there, for some reason or another, and we decided we were gonna look up one of the legends of that town, which was Sonny Boy Williamson. ln my opinion, he's the best harp player, that's like harmonica, blues harmonica, that l've ever heard.
He's the big Daddy of 'em.
And he took us to a friend of his, a woman's place, who served food and corn liquor. ln a southern booze can.
He would sit there and he was playing for us.
And we were getting drunk and trying to figure out where we were.
He was spitting in a can. l thought he was dipping snuff. l thought he had something in his lip.
And he kept spitting in this can and playing, and we kept getting drunker.
Finally, l looked over in the can and l realised it was blood.
He was getting pretty tired and pretty drunk by then.
And we made big plans for the future and all kinds of things we were gonna do.
And it was tremendous. A great night.
A couple of months later, we got a letter from his manager, or whoever it was, saying that he had passed away.

(Robertson) Paul Butterfield!
Near Memphis, cotton country, rice country, the most interesting thing is probably the music.
Levon, who came from around there?
Carl Perkins.
Muddy Waters, the king of country music.
(Robertson) Elvis Presley.
Johnny Cash. Bo Diddley.
That's kind of the middle of the country back there.
So bluegrass or country music, you know, if it comes down to that area and if it mixes there with rhythm and if it dances, then you've got a combination of all those different kinds of music.
Country, bluegrass, blues music.
- (Robertson) The melting pot.
- Show music.
- (Scorsese) And what's it called?
- Rock and roll!
(Scorsese) Yes. Exactly.

(Robertson) Garth was one of the most amazing musicians that we knew.
He could play better than anybody we ever heard.
And Garth joined The Band if we would make him the music teacher.
We didn't know why but we said
''Sure. l mean, we're interested anyway.''
And we had to pay him $10 a week each for these music lessons.
Then l was sure it was a riff.
But then l found out what it really was. lt was that, where he was coming from and his musical education, to tell his parents at this point that we was joining a rock-and-roll band would have been like pouring it down the drain.
So he justified it to his people and his background by being a music teacher.
There is a view that jazz is evil because it comes from evil people.
But, actually, the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians.
They were doing the greatest healing work.
And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.
' Boards on the window
' Mail by the door
' Why would anybody leave so quickly for?
' Ophelia
' Where have you gone?
' The old neighbourhood just ain't the same
' Nobody knows just what became
' Of Ophelia
' Where have you gone?
' Was it something that somebody said?
' Mama, you know we broke the rules
' Was somebody up against the law?
' Honey, you know that l'd die for you
' They got your number
' They're scared and running
' But l'm just waiting for the second coming
' Of Ophelia
' Please darken my door
' Was it something that somebody said?
' Mama, you know we broke the rules
' Was somebody up against the law?
' Oh, honey, you know that l'd die for you

' Oh, please, come back home
Most of the show stuff, though, was like travelling shows, like tent shows.
One was Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels.
- (Scorsese) What was that?
- Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. Yeah.
They used to have the show start, right?
They'd have the singers and the players and the different parts of the show.
Then the master of ceremonies would come out just before the finale and explain that, after the kids go home, they'd have the midnight ramble.
- (Scorsese) The midnight...?
- The midnight ramble.
The songs would get a little bit juicier and the jokes'd get a little funnier.
And the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it a few times.
A lot of the rock-and-roll duck walks and steps and moves came from a lot of that.
Everybody did it and so, when you would see Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry or Bo Diddley really shaking it up, it didn't come out of nowhere, lt didn't come out of the air. lt was like the local entertainment everybody was going to see.
So when they exposed it to the rest of the world, it was like this unknown beast that had come out, the grotesque of music that the devil had sent, you know?
Here we go.

Our Father, whose art's in heaven
Hollow by thy name - unless things change.
Thy wigdom come and gone.
Thy will, will be undone on earth, as it isn't heaven.
Give us this day our daily dread, at least three times a day.
And forgive us our trespasses on love's territory.
For thine is the wigdom and power and glory...
Oh, man!

- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
(Robertson) The road was our school. lt gave us a sense of survival. lt taught us all we know.
There's not much left that we can really take from the road.
We've had our share of...
Or maybe it's just superstitious.
- (Scorsese) Superstitious in what way?
- (Robertson) You can press your luck.
The road has taken a lot of the great ones.
Hank Williams. Buddy Holly.
Otis Redding.
Janis. Jimi Hendrix.
Elvis. lt's a goddamn impossible way of life.
- (Scorsese) lt is, isn't it?
- No question about it.

Come back onto this leg.
Weight on this leg.
Pull your weight back onto this....
Off that leg.
Onto this leg.
Weight back, there you go.
Okay, just take with your arm.
You wanna slide forward... and reach with your arm.
And slide back, step back.
- Arnold, do it behind me.
- Reach back with your arm.
And forward.
I'll do this twice, and then I'll come and look at you and correct you.
And back. Now what you want is mobility.
So you want a pass-through position that will keep showing the body, right?
- So where are your arms?
- Like this.
Start, I would think, with the focus up.
- Looking up?
- Looking up.
That would help....
That'll make a nice....
If your eye line goes up there....
- Right.
- Yeah.
That's the idea.
What you have to realize....
Okay, take it a little bit slower.
What you have to realize is that people are watching you all the time.
They're not just watching you there and there.
Keep it up.
And....
Gold's Gym, Venice, California...
where many of the best bodybuilders in the world come to train.
Jesus Christ!
- That's a sick guy.
- You're back.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
- Big Mac.
- How are you?
- All right.
- Good.
- How you doing?
- You remember Joey?
How you doing?
- Paul.
- I thought you'd forgotten all about me.
I thought you liked me as well.
Thought you'd forgotten all about me.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're the greatest.
Big Tony, how you doing?
- This is for me?
- Yeah.
- Kenny.
- How you been? Just got back?
Can I sign up here?
I want to start gaining some muscles.
Come on.
Pumped up, you know.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, 28 years old...
6'2", 240 pounds.
Mr. Olympia for the past five years.
He is preparing to defend his title this year for the last time.
All Mr. Universes from the past five years or so... get together in one contest to find out who is the best of all the Mr. Universes.
So they created the Mr. Olympia contest, which is then the top contest.
And whoever wins that is the top bodybuilder.
- And you are the top bodybuilder.
- Right.
How long have you been the top?
I've not been beaten for the last seven years.
And...
I won the Mr. Olympia contest five years now.
This is now the sixth year.
- They score on points?
- Yeah, on points.
It's like judging the body by muscularity, and by proportion... symmetry, the whole thing.
Do you visualize yourself as a piece of sculpture?
Yeah, definitely.
Good bodybuilders have the same mind... when it comes to sculpting, than a sculptor has.
If you analyze it, you look in the mirror and you say:
"I need more deltoids, more shoulders," so you get the proportions right.
So what you do is you exercise... and put those deltoids on.
Whereas an artist would just slap on some clay on each side.
Does it, maybe, the easier way.
We go through a harder way... because you have to do it on a human body.
I mean, obviously a lot of people look at you... and they think it's kind of strange, what you're doing.
But those are the people who don't know much about it.
As soon as you find out what the whole thing is about... then it's just like another thing.
It's not any stranger as going into a car... and trying to go in a quarter mile, five seconds.
I mean, that's, for me, strange.
The greatest feeling you can get in a gym...
or the most satisfying feeling you can get in a gym, is the pump.
Let's say you train your biceps.
Blood is rushing into your muscles, and that's what we call the pump.
Your muscles get a really tight feeling...
like your skin is going to explode any minute.
It's really tight, it's like somebody blowing air into your muscle.
It just blows up and it feels different.
It feels fantastic.
It's as satisfying to me as coming is.
As having sex with a woman and coming.
So can you believe how much I'm in heaven?
I'm getting the feeling of coming in the gym.
I'm getting the feeling of coming at home.
I'm getting the feeling of coming backstage when I pump up... when I pose out in front of 5,000 people,
I get the same feeling.
I'm coming day and night.
I mean it's terrific, right?
So, you know, I'm in heaven.
All right, got to do that.
This girl maybe didn't have a kiss for years.
I may as well give her a break.
Terminal Island, California...
a federal prison for men and women.
I wanna get me a kiss.
I heard about those guys in here.
Yeah, we got a few of them.
Come over here and I'll give you your kiss.
Yes, I got this pose.
He's got a beautiful body, man.
First time I ever seen somebody's arms 23 inches.
He's a big dude, all the way big dude.
I started reading about gaining weight and weightlifting in some magazines.
And I saw Arnold's picture.
And when I saw him from all those angles...
every angle those shots were taken from, he looked good.
And I said,
"That's the way I wanna look. "
My father's real tall and I'm short, so at least... if I can't get as tall as he is,
I wanna be as wide as he was.
Make one line.
Try to make one line straight.
So you always remember that you have to have a line.
Yeah, see now there's your line.
And look where you point.
Yeah.
Great.
I like what you had in Ironman.
Yeah, that's good.
Again, raise up the hand.
Remember one thing, when you pose... a lot of little guys have one habit.
And they hide away when they pose.
When they do an arm pose, they do like this.
The big guy will come right out with his arm.
Never do that, never hide away.
Like right now, you did like this.
You know, show them.
Show them the whole thing.
Make the move, open up the whole body.
Do the same thing again.
Yeah, great.
Look confident, yeah.
Good.
Yeah, do it!
Just pose slowly, good.
They'll go nuts.
Crowd's good tonight. Is it?
Close that arm more. Good.
Mike Katz.
31 years old, 6'1", 240 pounds.
One of the top amateur bodybuilders in the world.
Mike lives in North Branford, Connecticut, and is a junior high school teacher.
Show them the back, turn around for the back.
Good girl.
How about a "most muscular" in the front, like this, Michelle?
Like this, hands down.
Michael, show her the most muscular.
Good girl.
That's a girl.
- Can you do that?
- I can do that one, dad.
All right, you do that one.
Go ahead, one arm.
That's a boy, it's hard.
Feel this muscle, how hard that is, Michelle.
Feel up here, right here.
Isn't that hard? Yeah.
- Feel mine.
- Feel yours?
She wants you to feel yours, don't jump on me now. Come on.
Feel yours.
- Nothing, no muscle.
- Nothing? How about daddy's?
- Daddy got a big muscle?
- Yeah.
Come on, Mike, ripped, come on get up, come on.
Come on.
Good.
Get up.
Up.
Come on, up.
I can remember back in my life...
when I would be picked on quite often.
I'm sure every kid's gone through it.
But it just affected me more than,
I think, it would affect other people.
"Hey, four eyes, hey, cross-eyes. "
"You got rusty fenders on your bicycle. "
"Your bike isn't as good as our bike. "
"Hey, Jew boy. "
Or, "You're not Catholic, so you're no good. "
I can remember times when kids would be going to dances...
and I would leave a dance, like, 11:00 at night.
I'd leave a dance for no reason and say, "I'll show them. "
And go and run on a track for two or three hours.
Or go home and lift weights.
I got involved in all the peewee sports most kids play, hockey and so forth.
Then when I got into high school...
and I made all-state and all-American in football.
I was doing very well with the Jets until I got injured.
That was my biggest thing, to go on a football field and be so feared.
I wanted to be put in a cage and rolled out, like in a circus.
Big bars with chains and everything.
And then just hope like hell...
that everybody would run off the field when they saw me coming.
Let's give him a big welcome, Mike Katz.
In every contest I ever won...
or ever lost, I always got the most applause...
and the people were most for me.
When I went to the Mr. Universe contest in '72...
and in '73 and in '74...
I knew, even though
I didn't win the contest...
when I go to South Africa this year,
I'm sure the same thing is gonna happen.
The crowd is gonna be for me.
The contests in South Africa, in Pretoria... are the most important or prestigious amateur contests in the world... the IFBB Mr. Universe contest... which is amateur, open to amateur athletes.
Sort of along the guidelines of the Olympics.
And the other contest is a professional contest... open to professionals, because there's money prizes involved... and that's called the Mr. Olympia.
So I'll be competing in the Mr. Universe, since I am an amateur.
And... as I see it, from all of the people who I know who are gonna be there... and the best in the world will be there...
I feel it's gonna be between me and Ken Waller... for the overall championship.
I told you boys, I'm the quarterback.
I don't worry about Mike Katz, anyway.
The only one guy I worry about is Robbie.
He's good, but he lacks too many things.
His arms aren't big enough to match his chest.
His thighs are too big for his calves.
He hits one pose.
In that, he looks like a big spider.
What I'm gonna do when I get to Africa?
I'm gonna take Katz's shirt and hide it.
I'm gonna take everything I can find of his and hide it.
Mess his mind up a little bit.
Gonna be according to countries in alphabetical order.
Australia.
We need Australia.
Will you get your clan together, please?
Baghdad, Bahamas.
Tall man calls Mike Katz, USA.
I don't think there's much doubt.
Mike? All right.
Ken Waller, USA.
You didn't see a blue T-shirt around?
Paul, you see a blue T-shirt around with my crusher?
- Waller had it.
- He had it?
- Yeah.
- Where did he put it?
I don't know where he put it, Mike.
Number 89, from the United States of America...
Mike Katz.
It took me five years to win Mr. Connecticut.
It took me four years to win Mr. America.
This is my fifth year that I've been trying to win Mr. Universe.
I'm not a quitter.
It's like a dog. You can kick a dog so long and it will do two things.
It's either gonna roll over and die...
or it's gonna bite you and attack you.
And I'm the kind of person who's the type of a dog who would bite back.
I wasn't gonna roll over and quit.
Next one, 18, 18, 17, 18, 18.
- 83.
- 83? That can't be right.
It's a nine, yes.
17, 13, 16, 14, 11.
That's a four.
Yes, 13, 16, 14, 11.
- Total.
- 62.
Will the following gentlemen step forward?
They are the three finalists, not necessarily in order.
Ken Waller, USA.
Paul Grant, Wales.
Roger Walker, Australia.
And for your information...
the fourth-place winner was in fact Mike Katz.
Can you believe the tension with these fellas?
It's bad enough for you, how must it be for them?
So far, they made it, they made the big one.
They won the 1975...
IFBB Mr. Universe.
I wonder what time it is back in the States, do you know?
I've gotta call my wife.
- It's about 5:00.
- Good.
The kids ought to be playing, driving her crazy.
Third place in the tall man category...
IFBB, Mr. Universe...
from Wales, Paul Grant.
Second place...
from Australia, Roger Walker.
And the winner of the 1975 tall man category...
from the United States of America,
Ken Waller.
Kenny won. Great.
Terrific.
How about that?
Boy, that's fantastic.
Fantastic.
I can imagine how he must feel.
Incredible.
Probably like I did when I was 16 and won my first trophy.
In its own way, it's probably just as satisfying.
I gotta go shake his hand, that's fantastic, great.
And get my T-shirt.
Suffice to say the other two gentlemen won their height categories...
made the finals and our overall winner for 1975, Ken Waller...
United States of America.
- Want another pose?
- Yeah, just keep going.
Wait a second.
My parents in the beginning, when I started bodybuilding...
they didn't know really what it is...
until I introduced my father to bodybuilding...
and I took him to all the gymnasiums.
And he then started picking up weights, and making his arms strong and so on.
And then they started liking what I did.
Especially after I won the first international competition...
which was the first contest
I ever entered...
the Junior Mr. Europe in Stuttgart, Germany.
So when I came home with my trophy, my parents were very proud of me...
and they said, "My son, that's my son. "
My father was a police chief in Austria...
in a town called Graz.
We had a very strict upbringing because of him being with the police force.
We had to be the perfect example.
We couldn't do anything bad.
And it was kind of an uptight feeling at home because of it.
I always felt like my place is America.
And when I was 10 years old...
I only dreamed of coming to America and being the greatest.
And just being different than everybody else.
I never experienced anything like it.
- Open your legs wide, Arnold.
- Open my...
Get a little more power.
- Open your legs a little more.
- Little bit to the right.
Don't strain looking up at him.
Just put your face, just hug him, kind of sexy.
Crush it, Arnold.
Bend the exerciser.
I thought you were strong.
Put your legs behind his back a bit, could you?
Play with his hair a little.
Sandy, why don't you get down lower... so that your head is down closer to the floor.
That's it, right.
Okay, here we go.
Good, hold.
- You drink skim milk, don't you?
- No, I drink no milk.
- You don't drink any milk at all?
- No milk.
Milk is for babies.
When you grow up, you have to drink beer.
I was always dreaming about very powerful people.
Dictators and things like that.
I was just always impressed by people who could...
be remembered for hundreds of years.
Even like Jesus, being for thousands of years remembered.
- I dreamt about Arnold last night.
- Really?
I told him, "Arnold, you're making a big mistake going to Africa."
He says,
"Why do you say that, Mr. Ferrigno?"
I said, "Louie is waiting for you, in the shadows."
Lou Ferrigno, 24 years old, a former sheet metal worker.
Mr. America, and twice Mr. Universe.
He's turned professional this year, and is a contender for the Mr. Olympia title.
Lou lives with his parents in Brooklyn, New York.
At 6'5" and 275 pounds...
Lou is the largest bodybuilder ever.
And he thinks he can take the title from Arnold this year.
So does his father, Matty...
who retired from the New York City Police
Department to oversee Lou's training.
The first time Arnold came to America,
I took Louie backstage.
And when Arnold went by us,
I'll never forget...
I looked at Louie's face, and he just looked at Arnold with awe.
I thought God just passed us.
And I looked at Louie, I said,
"What do you think, Louie?"
And he looked at me, he said,
"Gee, Dad, he's big. "
And I would say that from that moment on when he first saw Arnold...
he wanted to be Mr. Olympia.
It was in his eye, in his heart, and in his mind.
And it became part of his entire body.
Okay.
- Right, let me complete a full rep.
- Okay.
- One.
- Right.
- Two.
- Right.
Up!
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay, come on.
Up, come on.
- Make it harder.
- All right.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
All the way.
All right. All right. All right.
- That was easy.
- Easy?
You do one.
Louie was only an infant in the crib, and he developed this ear infection.
We didn't know it at the time...
until Louie was about three years old, we found out that he was hard of hearing.
I guess that's why he never took an interest in things...
other kids would take an interest in, like television.
He was late learning to speak and everything.
Louie would become a lip reader.
Louie was a real skinny kid.
He couldn't make the football team because he was too skinny.
Then he started to buy Muscle Magazine.
I remember I would take him to a bookstore...
and he would buy up all the old muscle books.
And he would read for hours.
I remember...
2.:00, 3.:00 in the morning,
I would find his light on...
and he would be reading the muscle books.
So Louie decided to do a little bodybuilding.
I had an old weightlifting set in the cellar.
I used to do a little bit of it myself.
Never knowing at that time that someday...
Louie would be on the stage against Arnold, in Pretoria, South Africa.
You just keep after him.
Wherever he goes, you pose down with him, right next to him.
Let the judges make a comparison.
You're 6'5".
You'll be the biggest thing that ever went out on that platform, at 275 pounds.
They know that, and he knows it.
This is for the big baby, Louie.
This is for all the marbles.
And we're gonna go after it, right?
One year of training, all wrapped up in one night, Louie, remember that.
When you step out there, boy... remember all those grueling nights and mornings in the gym.
And this is it, this is the reward.
And we want it.
We want it so bad that we can taste it.
Remember that when we're on that stage.
We gotta get so excited, when we're there we have only one thought in mind.
That's the Olympia, we'll win.
- How long is Arnold sleeping?
- He's been here for a couple days now.
Yeah, a couple days?
The reason why I woke you up was because...
I am gonna go to New York tonight.
I did wanna say goodbye.
And I'm gonna see Ferrigno there.
We're gonna train for two, three weeks.
And everything... that I learned from you... that you stole from me,
I'm gonna give him.
I figure the combination's gonna be very hard to beat, Arnold, very hard.
I'll see you when you get back.
What should I tell Louie when I get to New York?
I mean, I am gonna train with him for a few days.
Tell Louie...
- that I said hi.
- Yeah?
Say to his father that I said hi.
And I'm looking forward to seeing him in South Africa.
- Okay?
- All right.
In other words, you want me to be very nice.
- Be very nice to him.
- Okay.
Because he needs a lot of help.
- See, the king of the hill can only go down.
- That's right.
- The king of the hill can only go down.
- Or stay up.
- Or stay on that hill.
- Right.
That's the other possibility.
But the wolf on the hill...
The wolf on the hill, right... is not as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill.
That's true, he's not as hungry.
But when he wants the food, it's there.
Biceps, the back, trapezius another thing.
Also, in fact, this evening I'm gonna jog about a mile and a half, two miles.
I think that's a good idea.
- You think we need more weight, Hank?
- Couple more pounds.
All right, good.
Here, we got 10 right here.
Come on, let's do 10 good reps, Lou.
10 good reps, come on.
- Come on, Lou.
- Come on, Louie.
Come on!
- No more.
- Come on, more!
Good boy. Come on.
- All right, good boy.
- That's the boy, Lou.
Not enough.
One more, same weight, Hank?
- I'm not satisfied. I'll put more weight.
- Let's go.
I wanna beat him!
I need 10 pounds.
- 10 pounds on each side?
- Yeah.
- How many, Hank?
- Come on, I wanna see ten.
- Ten!
- You're gonna do them, too.
- You're gonna wipe 'em out!
- I'll do it.
Come on, Lou, push. Drive 'em up.
That's it, man.
You're gonna do it, come on.
Arnold!
Six.
Seven. Goddamn, eight.
Come on, nine.
Suppose you get laid last night.
Keep going, ten. Come on.
Force them out, there's eleven.
Come on, Arnold.
Five.
Six.
Seven. Come on now. One.
Yeah. Two.
Three. Come on.
Four.
- Five.
- Harder!
- Come on, you can do it now.
- I can't concentrate with girls pushing.
Push.
All right, that's it, no more.
- Here's a present.
- What, are you crazy?
- Here, come on.
- God.
Make those arms grow, man.
Stick them out, stick it out, Louie.
Come on, get it up.
You do the work.
Come on!
Okay, take it.
Oh, my God.
- Good boy.
- Nice training.
Good boy.
Boy, what a workout.
Too hot.
- How do you feel, Lou?
- Pretty good.
Don't ever feel sorry for yourself.
Remember, if you're training hard, he may be training twice as hard.
You just gotta keep coming back stronger.
Right.
All the way, Louie, you'll never get this chance again.
All the way.
Look like a road map back here with fingers all over it.
Yeah?
Yeah, that's getting closer.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Two more.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four. Keep going.
Five. Keep going.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Come on.
Let's get serious.
Two more.
Two more, no matter what.
One more, Eddie. Flex when you come up.
Goddamn.
That's good.
The body that isn't used to maybe the ninth, tenth...
eleventh, and twelfth rep with a certain weight.
So that makes the body grow, then.
Going through this pain barrier.
Experiencing pain in your muscles and aching... and just go on and go on.
And this last two or three or four repetitions... that's what makes the muscle then grow.
And that divides one from a champion and one from not being a champion.
If you can go through this pain barrier, you may get to be a champion.
If you can't go through, forget it.
And that's what most people lack, is having the guts.
The guts to go in and just say, "I'll go through and I don't care what happens."
It aches, and if I fall down....
I have no fear of fainting in a gym... because I know it could happen.
I threw up many times while I was working out.
But it doesn't matter, because it's all worth it.
Franco Colombu.
The premier bodybuilder in the world under 200 pounds.
Five times a contender for the Mr. Olympia title...
he plans to win it this year from Arnold.
Once the featherweight boxing champion of Italy...
Franco comes from a small village in Sardinia.
Here, when you want to say,
"Where are you going?"
Somebody says, "Go to hell" when they get upset.
There they say, "Go to California."
It's like a place where you never get there.
And then finally
I came to California, really.
And now when I go back there and they ask me, "Where you live?"
I say, "In California."
They're not sure if I mean it or if I'm joking.
When I first started doing sports...
my mother used to scream at me.
She used to say,
"You don't want to work.
"You're just trying to punch people...
"trying to make a living without working."
And she was very much against that.
But right now, after everything went so good...
and I won in sports and I made money...
they are very proud about that.
I'm the strongest bodybuilder that ever lived, I think.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the strongest man in the world is blowing up a hot-water bottle.
That takes 600 pounds of pressure.
It's gonna pop.
- Okay, Franco.
- Lazy bastards.
Look.
I missed it.
Okay.
I met Arnold in Germany.
He came to United States,
I came to United States, also.
We went through many things together.
And now, I will be competing in the Mr. Olympia with Arnold.
Of course, I think I'm gonna win.
I have more definition...
and I'm more muscular.
But Arnold's taller than me, and that can be one advantage for him.
I think I can show the best out there.
The only problem now is matter of the judges' opinion, too.
You never really know what's going to happen.
Okay, Louie.
No, listen.
When you come out here and you're out here....
Right? They're all waiting for you, Louie.
They wanna see what you got, they've never seen you before.
You tense your legs, right?
Then you look at the crowd.
They're all looking at you.
Flashbulbs going off and all.
Then you put your arms like this.
You look at your arms like you're admiring, right?
You're admiring what you're gonna show them. And then you go....
Boom! Like you're saying:
"Take a look at this hunk of man."
Something like that. You try it now.
Look up, that's right.
That's it. No, down here, Louie.
I told you, look at your arms down here.
Look at both arms.
- Both arms?
- Right.
That's it.
Atta boy.
Now hold that pose.
Because remember, your arms are bigger than Arnold's.
They wanna see them, right?
They have never seen your arms.
They've seen Arnold's.
So hold that pose a while.
And I say, this pose, just tilt your body a little... because people on this side of the theater... and people on this side wanna see you.
So tilt your body just slightly like this.
Try that, Lou.
Atta boy.
You have to do everything possible to win.
You know, no matter what.
The day of the contest, if he comes in his best shape... and he's equally as good as I am... or if, let's say, he's a few percent better than I am...
I spend with him one night.
I go downstairs and book us together in a room... to help him for tomorrow's contest.
And... that night... he will never forget.
I will mix him up.
He will come so ready to South Africa, so strong.
But by the time the night is over, the next morning... he will be ready to lose.
I mean I will just talk him into that, it's no problem to do.
So, all those things are available.
And if they're available, you might as well use them.
So it doesn't matter if he comes in shape, or out of shape.
If he comes out of shape, at least it's less hassle for me.
And if he's in shape....
Fine, I hope he is.
But you couldn't pull this with Franco.
Franco's pretty smart.
Franco is pretty smart, but Franco is a child.
When it comes to the day of the contest, I'm his father.
He comes to me for advices.
So, it's not that hard for me to give him... the wrong advices.
Pretoria, South Africa.
Probably in an hour or two, we have a chance to see our room.
10 minutes.
I promise.
Can I just ask you one question?
The usual we ask.
What must your... special woman look like?
It really doesn't matter.
I like them with black hair, with brown hair, with red hair.
With big breasts, with little breasts, with big ass, with a little ass.
If the personality is great and if they're charming....
Wonderful, nothing to do, just lay out in the sunshine.
Can't wait to get into the sun.
Look at that sun out there.
We ordered it for you.
Watch out now, Lou.
- This is good.
- Get ready.
Holy cow.
He likes the oil.
Hold it up, that a boy, Lou.
Tense your muscles, Louie.
Pull in your stomach.
Sometimes when people ask you advice... if you think that they're being arrogant, or misusing the sport of bodybuilding... you give them kind of pranksterish advice.
And that's once happened in a Mr. Munich contest, I believe.
I think it was eight years ago... when some fella came to me in the gym and said:
"I want to win Mr. Munich.
I am a perfect poser...
"and I have a fantastic body.
"And I just want to learn a new posing routine, a new style.
"Something way out which nobody expects."
So I said, "Let me see your posing routine you have right now."
When the guy took his clothes off and posed for me... he looked like nothing, number one, and his posing was bad.
So I mean, he was just....
I think he was crazy.
So I thought, okay, if he thinks that he's the best poser...
I'm gonna pull a little trick on him.
And so that's what I did.
I said, "Listen, I have a new posing routine from America.
"I'm in correspondence with all the top athletes in America." And so on.
And I told him that the new thing is... that he has to scream while he's posing.
And he looked at me and he says...
"That's a new idea.
That will really come out impressive.
"When you go out on stage and scream, people can't miss you.
"They'll all look at you screaming, that's it."
So I taught him how to scream.
First of all, I oiled him up.
His body, with really heavy oil and everything.
We're standing there in the shower room.
And I taught him how to do it.
The higher your arms go up, the higher you make a screaming noise.
And the lower your arms come down, the lower the noise.
This kind of a thing.
I practiced with him for around two hours.
Spent a lot of time on developing his new posing routine.
And he mastered it very well.
He was screaming really loud and high and low.
And he went to the Mr. Munich contest.
I told him when he walks out, he has to scream loud, run out.
And so he did.
And obviously people weren't ready for that at all.
And so, he went out there, screamed loud.
Went through three or four poses with loud screaming.
They carried him off the stage and threw him out.
They thought the guy was totally nuts.
I'm shaking, really.
But when I get there,
I think I'll forget about it.
- Forget about it?
- Yeah.
When I get there, I'm even more nervous.
I'm not nervous at all.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ.
- Take it easy.
- What can I say?
You guys are psyching me out here early in the morning.
- The only way to do it.
- Lay down in the bus in the back.
Hey, Lou. Is this the master plan here this morning?
Right, be on guard.
I'm here now for six days and nobody invited me for breakfast.
This morning they say, "Come for breakfast with us, Arnold, have a nice breakfast."
He's talking about pumping up.
He's talking about psyching me out.
She's talking about my mother.
You're the king of kings, Arnold.
Shit. He's rubbing it in.
How are you doing, Lou?
- How you doing?
- Good.
Look kind of worried today.
Just a little tired, gotta wake up.
- They don't come nicer than you, Arnold.
- I'm a nice guy.
I wouldn't turn my back on you, Arnold, within 500 yards.
You don't trust me, why's that?
They should have the Olympia early on so we could relax, enjoy the country.
They should have it in a month for him.
He isn't even in shape yet.
He didn't get the timing right,
I'm telling you.
A month from now would have been perfect for you.
But then I'd get bigger, too, again... so doesn't matter, what the hell.
Let's get it over with.
And if you retire this year, you just never had the Olympia.
But you had twice the Universe, what the hell.
That's not too bad, either.
You could go on and win the next five years.
It's amazing. Can you imagine the feeling I have? Six times Mr. Olympia.
I told you, you've found the fountain of youth.
You could go on forever.
- It blows my mind when I think about it.
- People are so tired...
I called my mother yesterday already and I said, "I won."
She says, "Congratulations, Arnold."
Anyway, listen, guys, why don't we go?
You go and help him pump up.
Calm him down, help him. Okay?
Don't screw him up this time.
I don't want you in our pumping room.
Judges.
Final attention, you all understand our strict code and rule.
No talking whilst adjudicating.
And that also means, photographers, please do not speak to the judges.
I'll simply will have to remove....
Most of the judging at an international competition takes place during the day...
before the crowds and distractions of the nighttime show.
This is called the prejudging.
Double biceps, rear.
The judges look for three things.:
symmetry, proportion and the size and clarity of each muscle group.
Olympia contestants are judged in two classes.
Those over 200 pounds and those under.
At night, the two class winners will pose off for the overall title.
Each class poses first as a group, for comparison judging.
Then they come on one at a time to perform the six compulsory poses...
that show every part of the body.
He's so crazy.
What a monster.
Oh, my God.
These guys are like animals, man.
I can't believe it.
Look at this one now.
See, this is the hard part right here, look at that.
And your lats from the rear.
What's he got? Let's see.
You can call him "the bat" from now on.
- "Franco the bat."
- He could fly with that.
Finish with the left side chest... and your optional routine.
Nice shot, goddamn it.
That guy.... It gives you chills when you watch that guy.
I know. Isn't it unbelievable?
Look.
Ed Corney, a 44-year-old nightclub owner originally from Hawaii.
He is Franco's chief competition in the under-200-pound class.
Can you believe that?
I mean, that's what I call posing.
Okay, turn to your right,
Serge, face that way.
Turn right on. Look straight ahead.
That's it. That's the position we want.
An unexpected entry in the tall class of the Olympia contest.
Serge Nubret, 41 years old.
Six feet, 200 pounds.
Mr. France, and a movie and television star in Europe.
Don't lean back too much, you get wrinkles in the back.
- Don't go back too much.
- All right.
Okay, thank you.
Your back was out of sight.
Your back, fantastic.
Do I need more arm?
Louie, you should've did this one for your arms.
They called it.
I didn't wanna look small.
You mean this one?
No. You're wrong.
- Okay.
- Look, looks like nothing.
The arms are important. You've got arms, and he's got spaghetti arms, Louie.
I don't have any weak points.
I had weak points a few years ago.
But my main thing in mind is....
My goal always was to even out everything...
to the point that everything is perfect.
Which means if I want to increase one muscle a half inch...
the rest of the body has to increase.
I would never just make one muscle increase or decrease.
Because everything fits together now.
And all I have to do now is get my posing routine down more perfect...
which is almost impossible to do.
It's perfect already.
Yeah, it's down to a point.
Wait when you see it.
Relax.
Thank you, Arnold.
If you want to be a champion... you cannot have any kind of an outside negative force coming in and affect you.
Let's say before a contest, if I get emotionally involved with a girl... that can have a negative effect on my mind... and therefore destroy my workout.
So I have to cut my emotions off... and be kind of cold, in a way, before a competition.
That's what you do with the rest of the things.
If somebody steals my car outside of my door right now...
I don't care.
I can't be bothered with that.
I would only have my secretary call the insurance agency and laugh about it.
Because I cannot be bothered with it.
I trained myself for that.
To be totally cold and not have things go into my mind.
And it was, in a way, a sad story... when my father died.
Because my mother called me on the phone, and she said:
"Your dad died."
And this was exactly two months before a contest.
She says, "You come home to the funeral?"
I said, "No.
"It's too late, he's dead, there's nothing to be done.
"And I'm sorry, I can't come."
And I didn't explain to her really the reasons why.
I had other excuses to her, because how do you explain a mother... whose husband died, you know, your trip?
I didn't bother with it.
And that actually caused one of the greatest conflicts... with my girlfriend.
Because she just looked at me and said:
"It doesn't bother you?
"I mean, your father died."
I never talk about it again.
The finals of the Mr. Olympia contest.
First to be judged is the under-200-pound class.
He said 20 minutes from now, right?
- Take your time, you got all the time.
- Yeah.
Second place in the under-200-pound category...
from the United States of America...
Ed Corney!
And the winner... of the 1975 Mr. Olympia, under 200 pounds...
from the United States of America, via Italy...
Franco Columbu!
What did you say, Louie?
- What did you say?
- I'm training, Arnold.
- Gotta get a good pump.
- You make too much noise.
Supposed to be very quiet here, like in a church.
Tell him.
- I can take you.
- Keep looking.
- Thanks a lot.
- You've got a better neck.
I know.
- I watch you.
- I watch you, too.
There's a barbell above my head,
I better watch it here.
Okay.
We don't want no accidents here.
What symmetry you've got. You look like something Michelangelo cut out.
More oil, more. That's not good oil.
- Lou, relax.
- Would you?
- Tell them that we're ready.
- We are ready.
And now we come to the heavyweights...
over 200 pounds.
We have three contestants.
From the United States of America...
Lou Ferrigno!
From France, Serge Nubret.
From the United States via Austria...
the one and only, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Now we'll call on all three contestants...
Lou Ferrigno, Serge Nubret, and Arnold Schwarzenegger...
for a pose-down for the final decision from the judges.
Louie goes through his posing, and you watch every pose.
You sort of help him out, easy now.
Each pose he goes through, you're living it with him.
I mean, you just have to try to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
That you're actually out there with your son...
because you trained with him and you're posing with him.
The only thing you're not doing with him...
you're not getting the reward of the applause.
He's the one that's getting that, and he deserves it.
And you just hope the audience gives him more.
You wanna shout out,
"It's my son out there!
"Give him just a few more handshakes, a few more applause. "
And you just hope that he's the winner, that's all.
Third place, from United States of America...
Lou Ferrigno!
Second place, from France, Serge Nubret.
And the winner...
the one and only, Arnold Schwarzenegger!
Ladies and gentlemen, the two body-weight winners...
Franco and Arnold.
Come on, Franco, give him hell.
- This little guy he's talking about.
- Where is he?
Turn around.
Let's go.
The winner of the 1975...
overall Mr. Olympia...
the one and only, the greatest...
Arnold Schwarzenegger!
Louie, you're a baby, Lou.
These guys are all veterans.
You're just growing.
This takes years and years.
In two years, Louie, they'll have never seen anything like you.
They'll think you were carved out of stone.
Just gives you the motivation to train harder.
Your day will come, Louie.
Someday you'll have a back,
Louie, nobody ever seen.
So it's no more, because it was my last year of competition.
I would like to announce officially
I'm retiring from bodybuilding competition.
I would like to thank you all for supporting me.
I would like to thank the judges.
Bodybuilding has been a beautiful experience for me.
And I will continue it for the rest of my life.
I only stop competing, but I'm not stopping bodybuilding.
It's the greatest sport. Thank you.
I want to have everybody sing
Happy Birthday to Lou... because it's Lou's birthday today.
It's Lou's birthday today, too.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear Louie
Happy birthday to you
All right!
Speech!
I have nothing to say,
I just wanna eat my cake.
I'm gonna come over and have a nice meal over at your house.
- Some good cheesecake.
- You're gonna come over?
Yeah, I will, when I come back from Austria, I'm gonna call you.
And she's gonna fix her nice spaghettis, meatballs... cheesecake, apple strudel, the whole business.
Yeah, she says she's gonna bulk me up to 280 pounds.
And then she's gonna fix me up with your sister.
I'll talk to him later on.
Louie, he moved over for you, Louie.
Let's put him out, Louie.
Big Louie.
Inspiration of the pet cemetery business...
is a little story that probably
leads me back many years.
I was born in the state of North Dakota... county of Barnes, city of Valley City.
I was there for several years.
Being born in 1930, then the World War II started... in 1941, when I went to the farm.
On the farm, I had my own pet collie... which worked with me and was beside me.
No matter what I did and where I'd go, my pet collie was with me.
One afternoon, we came back from hauling bundles...
"thrashing," the old word's going.
And an old Model A came up the road, struck my collie and killed him.
I never did catch him.
But I grabbed my collie... and held him in my arms until he died.
And I pulled one little acre of land right behind the house...
I'd say a quarter of a mile away.
It overlooked the prairie to the north... which was really a beautiful...
It had a lakeside at the back.
I picked that as the cemetery for my own collie.
Right across the street
from where I lived in Los Altos...
was the most beautiful piece of land...
as far as I was concerned,
in the whole valley.
And, boy, I knew what to do with it:
Make that into a pet cemetery.
I thought, "Well, this is going to be
my project of life."
I found the land, I found the need.
Something the old-timers
used to tell me years ago:
"To be successful in this world
and life, find a need and fill it."
And, boy, I found a need and I wanted
to fulfill this more than anything.
More than anything I did my whole
life, I wanted to fulfill this dream.
And there is where we started our work.
Planning, development, and getting the people interested.
Working with...
I worked with
Carnation Pet Food Company...
Safeway Stores, Lucky Stores.
Several.
I remember talking with Dicky Euwe... of Dick's Supermarkets... and asking him if I could come and work in his pet food section... and just hand out my cards and talk to the people... about having a pet cemetery.
I went to grooming shops,
I went to veterinarians.
And the interest I got was just phenomenal. It was just great.
So then I had to get some more interested people... in the idea of it, because we needed the financing.
Floyd is a heartwarming individual who likes to do a lot for everybody.
And he came into the office one day, and him and I got to talking.
His real name, I think, is Floyd, but we always called him Mac.
And Mac, very surprisingly, said to me that... something he had always wanted to do was put a pet cemetery together.
So I said, " Mac, that's amazing...
"because we've just been thinking about the same thing ourselves...
"and maybe we can put it together under one group."
So he said, "Wonderful."
So I was made aware of this property...
that is in Los Altos
on Foothill and Highway 280.
We felt that it would make
a great place for a pet cemetery...
because it had tremendous visual ability...
and thousands of cars that went past 280.
And the property leaned
in other directions as well.
It was a marvelous location
for a restaurant or a motel.
Various and sundry things.
We found that people by the name
of Dunton owned the property...
and we approached them
and asked them what they thought.
There was a meeting held at Mr. McClure's house... which I attended.
I was a little late, but during the meeting...
Mr. Dunton had expressed his wishes, desires, and needs... to Mr. McClure, and emphasizing very strongly:
"Mac, you have nothing to worry about.
"I'm a minister of this particular church.
"You can trust me. I'm a minister.
"We will have a pet cemetery.
It will be a success.
"You and I, we'll put it together.
"We'll do it. We'll have it. Just you and I."
It was sort of a kismet idea.
So we went to work on the pet cemetery.
The ugly crisis... which we used as our basis... and this was nothing against the SPCA of Santa Clara County... or the Animal Control Officer of Santa Clara County.
But the idea that we needed the concept... for the people that loved their pets, and needed a place for them.
Not the garbage pit, not the garbage can... and a place to bulldoze them into the ground... because we have more love and desire for Mother Nature's little pets.
God only gave us these pets... to be our fellowship, desire, and will.
And what have we got to give them in return?
Not to be put into a garbage pail or a dump ground... but our last goodbye for the things they gave us.
Rendering is an old industry. It dates
back to the time of the Egyptians.
They can trace it back this far, rendering.
In the Bible,
way back in the Old Testament...
the guy cut off the sheepskin
and put it over him...
and put the lamb fat on him
to keep him warm.
It could be the oldest industry
in the world. It could be. It's possible.
When the public got concerned about recycling... that's when the rendering industry started to blossom out, so to speak.
And say, " Hey, we've been recycling for 500 years here.
"Take a look at us. We are recycling.
"We're doing what everybody wants us to do."
And that's when we started to come forward.
Before that, nobody talked about the rendering industry.
That's why it was the invisible industry.
Nobody ever mentioned it.
On the quiet side, what those guys do out there is... they boil all this stuff in pots.
Stinks.
What is a rendering company?
My mind pretty near exploded with the thought and the memories... of a very bad nightmare.
A dream of hell.
And it took me back to this rendering company in North Dakota... where all the little pets at that time, when they died, were...
A truck would come out... and a big old driver would come and grab your pet... and throw him in the back end of this old truck... and take him to what I called
"the boiler chambers."
It's controversial. In other words... we stay low-key.
We don't want people to know we're bringing in animals... and reprocessing animal byproducts.
Some people get nauseated by the thought.
They get nauseated by it, you know that?
I've had people ask me...
I've been at a dinner party, been sitting down at a dinner table.
And somebody will say, "What do you do?"
And I say, "Hey, I'm in the tallow business."
And somebody will say:
"Don't bring that up right now.
Wait until after when we all break up."
In other words, " We don't want to talk about what you do, Mike.
"It makes us sick."
Why, I don't know. But it does.
People say that all the time.
We called it back home "a glue factory." They don't waste nothing.
They take the meat and strip it.
They take the bones... and boil them, cook them, and make some kind of meal out of them.
And they don't waste nothing, not even the toenails on the animal or anything.
And the smell that came from it.
I walked in there one day as a child, and saw all these animals laying there.
Being a 4-H man and an animal lover...
I just thought:
"Boy, being in hell, here I am.
I'm sitting on the floors of hell now."
Mike furnished the car, the station wagon.
And Mac furnished some furniture, his time, and his promotion skills.
And Joe, also furniture and some labor.
We both dug the first few graves.
And I made some of the caskets... and Joe would also go around and pick them up.
He'd go around and pick up the pets to be prepared.
Burying the pets was a very difficult task.
Mr. McClure was physically handicapped.
He couldn't in no way do any physical labor whatsoever.
My having full-time employment... was mostly done in the evening.
A gentleman came to my door.
And the gentleman was a huge man.
I'd say about 6'2".
Large.
He's more the Hercules type.
He asked me, " Are you Floyd
McClure?" And I said, " Yes, sir."
He said, "Do you have the pet cemetery across the street?"
My house was right across the street from the cemetery.
I said, "Yes, sir."
And he started crying.
I asked him, "What's wrong?"
He said, "Last night my dog died."
He says, "I want to bury him this morning."
And his family was home, and they were going to go to church.
But he had him completely wrapped.
Like a mummy, pretty near.
I would then get the pet out of his car... lay him out in the driveway, and proceed to clean him up... brush him out, make him as presentable as possible.
We had all kinds of animals.
I mean, every type of animal.
We had snakes, rats, monkeys, chickens... hamsters, mice. Seen a few.
Rodents of all types.
And we had, of course, dogs.
Cats were our main pets.
But it doesn't make any difference what type of animal.
You love it.
And you want to give it a proper burial.
That's your business.
You bury that pet because you love it.
You could have... the idea that all animals should be buried.
But if you live over here, or 5 or 10 miles away... and you have a horse, and that horse dies on a Saturday... and it's 102 degrees, and you can't get anybody to bury it... you're going to get a hold of the rendering company real fast.
Because you want that horse out of there, like, now. See?
I remember one young lad there that...
He had a pet lamb.
And his lamb died, and right away, his dad picked up the phone.
This is a 4-H animal... that he had taken from birth, and he just loved this animal.
And right away, his father had grabbed the phone...
And back in North Dakota, very few people had phones.
But at this particular farm, they had a phone.
He called the rendering service outside of Valley City... and asked them to come and pick up the animal.
I've had people call who have an animal... and they want us to bury it.
We don't bury animals, and they're crying. People are very emotional.
That's why it's a controversial thing.
That's why I don't like to break away and get into the individual thing.
You take a guy who loses his pet horse.
I mean, to some people, you know... it's like losing their son or their daughter.
I mean it. That's no kidding.
They're really chilled up bad. It's heavy.
You know, you get some real moaners on the phone, and they're crying.
This young lad, he was so upset... he went out and jumped on his pony and rode clear over to our place... and told me that his pet had died... and wanted to know if he could bury his pet with my collie out there.
I said, "Sure."
So we hooked up a team of horses... and we headed out to his place to beat the rendering truck.
And we did. We got there and got the pet on the wagon... and got him back over to the farm.
I guess we beat the rendering truck by about two hours or something.
We had a little altar set up in the office with some artificial flowers.
And Mr. McClure would light the candles... and be ready to receive... the mourning owners of the pets.
The mother was uptown shopping... and the kids were home.
I'm not talking about small children.
I'm talking about kids that are teenage children.
And the mother gave them specific chores to do.
One was, the girl was to wash and dry the clothes.
One was to wash... and the other was to take the clothes and put it in the dryer.
So anyway, the job was done.
The girl threw the clothes in the dryer and slammed the dryer door shut... and walked back to the kitchen.
As I understand this now... she heard some meowing and frightened screams of the cat.
They were looking for the cat and couldn't find the cat.
All of a sudden... they heard it in the dryer.
They opened the dryer door up, and the cat was in the dryer.
The little cat suffered a broken neck.
I guess they called out the fire department and tried to revive the cat.
But the cat did pass on.
The love... that people have for their pets is really tremendous.
It's something that is very difficult to explain.
On several occasions, I've seen it myself... where we were burying a pet... the whole cemetery would be at the grave site... the children... the mother, and the father would really break down... and actually cry.
The little services that we give out there at the cemetery... we bring out pretty much that:
"Here before us lies little Toby.
"Little Toby was put on this Earth for two reasons: To love and be loved.
"And today, we're standing here saying goodbye to little Toby...
"who was the Smiths' beloved little friend.
"Now, we're going to give you back, little Toby, to Mother Nature."
We had a gal here. I had a gal hired here.
Now, this will show you what you're up against.
She never went in the plant, she never left this office.
You don't see anything of this plant.
These trucks.
You don't see too much, right?
And she didn't see anything.
But she left. She quit working here... because it bothered her mind.
The mere fact of what we did bothered her mind.
And she never saw a damn thing or smelled anything.
One thing that really bothered me a lot... that really got into my heart... was knowing, not only that animals... are being treated in such a violent way after death... in this rendering company... by being torn apart... and every scrap of their body being used in one way or another.
But the smell and stuff was so terrific... we'd even sit down in the evening time to our meal... and the only thing that hit your nostrils... wasn't that good piece of meat you were about to eat... or the vegetable... or the nice dessert that's put on your table.
But you first had to grab the wine glass and take a whiff of that.
Get the smell of the rendering company out of your nostrils.
You know John Ascuaga's Nugget up there?
They lost one of those elephants once.
Didn't know what the hell to do with it.
We got it.
And somebody made the statement:
"Hey, that thing went to the rendering company."
We had so many phone calls... and we actually had to deny that we had that animal.
We told them we took it out to a pet cemetery and buried it.
Because people just didn't want to get... People got chilled up.
What happened to that animal?
What happened to that elephant?
Where's the elephant? Every once in a while, they'll lose a giraffe at the zoo... or they'll lose Big Bertha, or Joe Bear or whatever his name is.
And I mean, people say,
"Hey, what's going on here?"
We better bury this and get a plot and everything.
So we have a standing deal with the zoo.
They don't tell them where the animal went.
Because they don't want to be in the burying business.
When I came here, and seen this ugly crisis... these gas chambers that they got built down here... and these pets half-dead going into the dump grounds... and the bulldozer going over the top of them... and leaving them half alive in the garbage dumps... brought me back to that, and I thought, "We're going to beat this."
And this is part of the inspiration... of getting our little pets... out of these places and into a cemetery.
Something that we could be proud of saying:
"My little pet has done his chore here.
"That God has sent him to us to do a chore: Love and be loved...
"and serve his master." And, boy, these little pets have done that.
And not let them go into the bases of the living hell.
Like I said before, "Death is for the living and not for the dead."
Sing, baby.
Come on.
I want my mama.
Oh, so sleepy.
Attaboy.
I want my mama.
Are you sleepy? We'll sing loud.
How can I say how you miss them.
And how you wake at night and feel around for her... hoping that's she's all right, and then she's not even there.
It's heartbreaking. And then you remember that she's gone.
You get to thinking where she is.
You know where she is and you're happy where she is.
The next day you go out and take flowers, maybe meditate a little bit... and think of how often maybe you cried into her fur.
People like people because they like one another.
And people don't trust one another thoroughly... like an animal and a human being.
I can know you very well.
But when I turn my back, I don't know you.
Not truly.
But my little dog...
I can turn my back on my little dog... and I know he's back there.
He's my little friend.
He's not gonna jump on me or bite me or anything like that.
But human beings cannot be this way.
We didn't get an agreement, which is our fault, in writing.
And it just kept getting involved and more involved.
And since there was no final agreement, then we started... to differ on ideas, and get into a few arguments.
A pet cemetery business is not a fast-buck scheme.
It's not a suede-shoe game.
It's a good, solid business enterprise.
And in order to have this concept... it has to be in your heart and not in your billfold.
And these are the type of people
I wanted in business with me... in the pet cemetery concept.
The reason, unfortunately, why we didn't continue on... with the entire development of the pet cemetery was... we couldn't actually work it out with our investors... that we could project exactly what the income would be for it.
Because we had no way of projecting the amount of people... that would want to put their pets into a cemetery... even though we felt that there was a great need for it.
So after several weeks and several months, we decided... it would be better to turn it back to the original owners... which was Mr. Dunton and his family.
I was told... that Duntons trying to get themselves involved in some sort of gold venture... or exporting of dead animals from the United States to Mexico... for some university in Mexico... to do some exploration type of work on the animals.
Mr. Robert Dunton had convinced Mrs. Ken Dunton... to have her child born in Mexico, so he would be a Mexican citizen.
And under those pretences... he could have a business in Mexico and control it.
Mr. Dunton came back into town... and he decided at that time that...
Well, maybe, this is just a great thing.
I can't speak for this man's mind.
But the only thing I thought at the time was the way they decided...
I should open one grave site, put several pets into one grave, close it.
To me, that only spelled one thing:
"Let's get all the bucks we can out of this."
Mac called me and says:
"Well, we can't come to a final agreement, and I got put out today."
He says:
"The attorney's advice would be to get all those pets over on the legal side...
"and vamoose."
So that's what we did.
Mrs. Billingsley came out to the cemetery... and said that they had moved the stone on her animal.
And I said, " How are they gonna to get the animal out of the grave...
"the casket out, if they don't move the stone?"
And she said she didn't want her animal moved.
She said, "You talk as if I didn't care about my animals."
And I said, "Well, that's the way it appears to me."
I asked her if she'd signed a release, and she said she had.
Then she said she hadn't.
So I don't know. I can't swear to that.
But I made up my mind
I wasn't going to fool with her.
She went down and talked to Mr. Robert Dunton... and I sat in the car waiting for his son.
I was supposed to sign the release to let my dog go.
And then I saw both of them look in my direction and start laughing... like it was just a big joke.
She isn't going to cause me any trouble... because I'm not going to pay any attention to her.
She just wanted to be noticed.
She just wanted to be Miss Big.
And here we have all of these other poor people that really needed help... and she was just trying to be Miss Big... and she didn't pay half as much as the rest of us did.
I don't know whether she really liked her animals or loved them... or whether she was just trying to show off, make a big impression.
This was my idea... because anybody that would come whizzing up in a Cadillac... with all of her furs on, to a cemetery... and you know when they're digging animals, there's gonna be an odor... didn't have much upstairs.
Because, I'll tell you, that was not the place to wear fur.
I think that something should be done so that it shall never happen again.
I think it was a horrible thing for us in this generation to have it happen.
And in a state like California... to have something like that,
I think it's inhumane.
I think Mac really wanted a pet cemetery... and I think he probably had a great love for animals.
Unfortunately, it's not that easy.
You can't just go out and start something like that, build a chapel... and pay $50,000 an acre for land... and pay taxes, interest on the balance... for 25 cents.
Impossible.
And the Duntons were not interested... in that beautiful Garden of Eden that Mac had in his mind.
Because I really think he had it in his mind.
So as a total... before it finally wound up and went to the final lawsuit...
I myself lost around $30,000.
I'm not sure how much Joe has lost.
It's in that neighborhood.
I suppose after you lose this kind of money... you just keep working at it until you're a success at something.
The only thing that I'm guilty of is compassion.
And that's all.
If you want to put... to what I was charged with... in the courts... the only thing they can charge me with is compassion.
Because I put my heart over the dollar sign.
It wasn't the dollar I was after.
It was to take care of my customers... and my dedication to what I believed in.
Then, because of the way
I proved my point... by using my heart... into fulfilling my obligation... then I was condemned.
Then they write letters... telling everybody I'm no longer part of it... which broke me... not only financially... a burden upon myself and everyone else...
I was not only broke... but broken-heart.
I was raised on a farm...
where we had chickens, pigs,
cows, sheep, and everything.
But down here I've been lost.
Now they're taking them all away from here up to the...
What's the name of that place that's up above here a little ways?
That town?
Commences with "B."
It's Blue Hill Cemetery,
I think the name of it is.
Not too far, I guess about maybe
20 miles from here.
A little town there, a little place.
You know where it's at.
But I was really surprised... when I heard they were getting rid of the cemetery over here.
They're putting buildings or something over there.
I know people have been very good to me, you know.
Well, they see my condition, I guess, and felt sorry for me.
But it's real my condition is.
It's not put on, that's for sure.
Boy, if I could only walk, if I could only get out... drive my car...
I'd get another car.
Yeah. My son, if he was only better to me.
After I bought him that car...
He's got a nice car.
I bought it myself just a short time ago.
I don't know. These kids... the more you do for them...
He's my grandson, but I raised him from 2 years old.
And my husband always told me... he says, "Mama, someday you're going to be sorry."
That was a car?
Oh, boy.
He said,
"Someday you're going to be sorry."
You see how it happens, things?
I don't see him very often.
And he just got the car.
I didn't pay for all of it. I gave him $400.
Pretty good. His boss knows it.
He's not working for that outfit now.
He's changed.
He's gone back on his old job, hauling sand.
No, not hauling sand.
He's working in the office. That's right.
He took over the office job.
His boss told me that on the phone.
But, you know, he should help me more.
He's all I got.
He's the one who brought me up here.
And then put me here by myself among strangers.
It's terrible, if you stop and think of it.
I've been without so much when I first came up here.
Half of my trouble is from him not being home with me.
Didn't cost him nothing to stay here.
Every time he needed money, he'd always come:
"Mom, can I have this? Can I have that?"
But he never pays it back.
"Too good, too easy."
That's what everybody tells me.
I quit now. I quit.
Now he's got the office job,
I'm going after him.
I'm going after him good, too.
If I have to... do it in a different way.
He's going to pay that money.
He's got the office job now.
He makes good money anyway.
And he has no kids. He's not married.
"Never get married," he says.
He was married once. They're divorced.
Well, she tried to take him for the kid, but she didn't.
They went to court.
It was somebody else's kid.
She was nothing but a tramp.
I told him that. He wouldn't listen.
I said, "I know what she is.
Richard, please, listen to me."
No, he wouldn't listen.
He knew it all. He knew everything.
Big shot.
But he soon found out.
Now that's all over with.
I've been through so much,
I don't know how I'm staying alive.
Really, for my age...
If you're young, it's different.
But I've always said,
"I'm never going to grow old."
I've always had that.
And people that I tell how old I am, they don't believe me.
Because people my age, as a I rule, don't get around like I do.
Skippy's been dead quite awhile,
two or three years.
I don't want to think about it.
Everybody liked that dog around here.
You know, you miss your pets just like you do any of the family.
And I don't know what happened to this last little kitty who was here.
Now all the cats have gone.
There's no cats around, no animals, no nothing.
I miss that little black kitten so much.
It was wonderful.
And all of a sudden, boom.
No animals around.
Somebody in the neighborhood or something is doing away with them.
The thought of trying to bury 400 pets...
was pretty hard to accept at the outset.
However, we felt that we had
an obligation to pet owners...
because if we were not to take on
this endeavor...
it would leave many pet owners
with a sour taste...
and could set our industry back
for a long time.
We are often asked:
"Why is your business apparently
successful where others have failed?"
The only answer that I can give
is a very obvious one and that is:
We have tried to follow
sound business practices...
where it's quite obvious
that other pet cemeteries...
that have now failed, did not.
This cemetery will be in business...
50, 60, 70, or 100 years from now.
Certainly beyond the lifetime of anybody... who ever buried a pet here.
I think this is all that concerns people that have buried their pets here.
When we decided... to turn the property into a pet cemetery... and we discussed a name... we just all agreed that we couldn't come up with a better one... than Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park, which has a lovely sound.
The connotation is something living, bubbling.
A well with lovely, refreshing spring water.
And it has a meaning of life... and purity... and all of the good things that we all like to think about.
Most people don't know it, but we're in the middle of a pet explosion...
throughout not only the United States,
but throughout the world.
And this has been brought about...
from the new pattern that has
emerged in the last 10-15 years...
in the family life.
I would say that the pill is largely more responsible... for the pet explosion than any other single factor.
This is quite a surprise... to a lot of people that don't understand the business... and haven't done any background work.
But it's very simple.
The old style was for the husband to earn the living... and the mother stayed at home.
Today, we have a different pattern.
Today, husband and wife both work.
And they want to prepare themselves...
with a home and some of the things
they would like to have...
before they start a family.
Well, this is just fine from a planning standpoint.
But nature can't be put aside.
When the young mother comes home, she has to have something to fondle.
Something to mother, something to love.
She'll have a pet.
The rest of it, in the normal pattern... would be that the grandparents... would have children.
Grandchildren... to take care of, to fondle, and to help to rear.
This would satisfy their need for love and giving of love and receiving.
But when this has been set aside for five, six, seven, or eight years... what do they do? They get a pet.
Now we're talking about both sides of the family.
We are not talking about just one.
Now we have a three-way explosion.
Well, we're here... to put Caesar in the ground today.
I know this is something that you've not looked forward to... but I would just be interested to know... how you picked Bubbling Well.
And just tell us a little about Caesar... so we can have as much personal feeling about this as you do... because we're going to be
Caesar's caretakers... and take care of his plot from now on.
And although we can't know... personal details about all the pets of all who come to Bubbling Well... we have a great feeling for pets... and we certainly want to include
Caesar in our pet family.
Cal, here's a little picture of Caesar.
If you see that, you can understand... why we wanted him buried in a good place like Bubbling Wells here.
You know, I feel like I know him.
- Is that right?
- That face and that smile.
He was quite some dog.
And what was his pedigree again?
He was a mixture of Australian sheep and terrier.
- And terrier?
- Yeah.
You can see with all that hair he had.
Did he have a coat.
- And look at that face.
- Isn't he beautiful?
I've never seen that kind of a mix.
And we get many different combinations.
One thing that we get and we see... is it's the combinations, it's the crossbreed that produce seemingly...
- the best pet.
- Right.
The purebreds are fine... and a lot of people enjoy their relationship... as much as others.
But it seems that when we get a mix... somehow it seems to bring out the best in all the breeds.
- And they make a better pet.
- Right.
I don't know. This is most unusual.
Most unusual.
I just can say
I've never seen anything like that.
- He always had hair over his eyes.
- That's from the sheep in him.
He never had any trouble looking out?
- No, he found his way around good.
- He got around.
- I'm glad you showed that to me.
- He always got around me pretty nice.
I bet he did.
Our oldest son,
who was in the insurance business...
back in Salt Lake City... decided that insurance business pressures were getting to him... and he made a trip back home... just to look around the Bay Area to see what might be available.
His mother, as devious as she is... got him on the hill and really sold him a bill of goods.
And the next thing we knew... he had decided to bring his little family back to Napa.
Every young guy has an aspiration...
to pursue a very aggressive sales field.
About the only thing
I could think about was insurance.
I started off as a salesman, worked
my way up to a sales manager.
But throughout the whole thing...
I wasn't cognizant of it...
but I was actually using my strength
and my youth to the height.
I was burning out.
I could not exceed 150 pounds...
no matter how much I ate...
There was so much mental work there.
I had, ultimately, no free time.
So I resigned my position.
Of course, gave them plenty of warning.
And decided to come back to California.
I have to say to myself, what does it mean to me?
What does this mean to me?
What is it going to mean to me?
I recognize this and...
A couple of things when I was instructing motivation... back in Salt Lake City... is that, you know... if we don't stop and ask ourselves a question once in a while... to probe our subconscious or to probe our conscious...
I used to teach it.
It's a plain, simple formula.
We reduced everything to a formula, memorized it... and therefore we were able to repeat it constantly.
I used to call it the R2/A2 Formula.
Recognize, relate, assimilate,
and put into action.
Like I could be driving down the freeway and see a 450 SL... and I can say, "Hey, I like that."
What does that mean to me?
What would I have to do to get it?
How can I do it?
And then go to work for it. And strive for it.
It kind of makes life easy.
I think that's why a lot of people don't...
They get frustrated.
They have emotional problems...
because they don't know
how to cope with their mind.
There are three things that I've got to do...
that anybody has to do
if they want to be successful.
To have the desire, the "want to."
Why do you go to work in the morning?
Gee, why am I here?
Because you want to.
But that's obvious.
And then, the next very important ingredient... is something that a lot of people and businesses fail to delve into.
It's the activity-knowledge.
It would be the equation... to a mathematical problem.
It would be equal... to the chemist's ability to emulsify chemicals.
You know, properly, the valences.
But the knowledge of it, the whole scope, everything in detail.
And then the third element would be the know-how or the experience.
I have the inspiration to action.
I don't have the activity-knowledge...
but I'm getting the know-how
before the activity-knowledge.
In fact, I'm getting more know-how
than activity-knowledge.
But they can be correlated together.
They can be overlapped.
Our youngest son, graduated from Chico... with a degree in Business Administration.
He thought that this entitled him... to an executive position out in the world somewhere.
After many interviews he found that it wasn't that easy.
So he agreed to come home... and, with a lot of reluctance, to try this out... to see how he and his lovely father would get along.
College is an interesting experience...
and I was kind of taken with it
my first few years.
I would study eight or nine hours a night.
I really caught up on the idea of doing a lot of studying.
But towards the end of my college days...
I ended up partying more than I did actually studying.
You know, I learned a lot.
I took many classes... say, in Mathematics,
Business Administration...
Marketing, and things like that.
You're given things to learn... however, you don't retain the knowledge that you learn.
It's the idea that you're applying your brain, you're exercising it.
That's the part where the education comes in, I think.
Something also that happened,
it happens to everybody, I suppose.
I fell in love up in Chico.
I think the important thing
in falling in love...
before you fall in love, you should have...
True love, I think, is experiencing
many different types of loves...
and learning exactly what you want
out of a relationship.
I spent about two and a half years with a woman.
I fell in and out of love and I learned a lot of things.
"Nothing lasts forever"... was something that hit home.
I think a broken heart is something that everybody should experience.
Because it makes you appreciate... any future experiences that you have.
You've felt the hurt... so you can enjoy the positive aspects of love.
I finished all those experiences...
and I came back here to the park...
and my father offered to take me on...
to teach me the business.
I knew we had many houses up here...
and I would have no problem
having a place to live.
And I lived down in the chicken coop
down in the little house for a while.
Then I got this place...
which is a pretty nice place
for just one person.
The House on the Hill is what we call it.
And so, I moved up here.
I still haven't completely moved up here.
I still have a lot of my stuff
down in the chicken coop.
My dad initiated this whole program...
I would say, approximately six years ago.
So therefore he has
the greater amount of knowledge.
He has the public relations
with the veterinary doctors.
He knows them not only by name...
but also by their secretaries'
and also their wives' names.
He has a vast amount of knowledge.
My brother Danny has been working
in the park for about three years.
He has quite some knowledge
of procedures and public relations.
Therefore my father is the focal point.
He trained my brother,
he gave him the knowledge.
He taught him this route
that I'm responsible for now.
I find it quite hard right now...
to go out on my daily task here at the park...
without consulting my brother or my father.
One thing in the insurance business that I always did, that got me ahead... is I was able to memorize quite well with hardly any effort.
I have to literally memorize the streets and localities of veterinary clinics.
These clinics are literally...
speckled all over
that southern peninsula area.
I have to get on the freeway
and go to this one...
and come back on to this one
and pick up from where I left.
I have to memorize the routes,
know exactly where they are.
What road to take to get to it...
to get back on to the right road,
to get to the next one.
Naturally, there's an element of fear
that I have.
With our Permalloy markers... we have several different formats that the people can choose from.
You can see some of the different formats right here.
In some situations when the people don't have actual photographs... they can sketch a picture... right on to the alloy steel.
Probably the most popular type of marker... that we have in the Permalloy... is what we call a vertical-type picture.
The reason being, in a vertical type picture... they can place the photograph in a position... so they are getting maximum amount of surface coverage... with maximum amount of wordage usage.
I have to keep telling myself... there's going to be more parts to this.
There's going to have to be an advance selling program.
I'd like to be selling in Los Angeles... and getting the cemeteries there and starting another one in LA.
Maybe Seattle, a larger city where there are a lot of animals.
With our private burials we have two systems of marking.
The first is what we call a grid system.
The way it works is we have a rectangle... with letters and then numbers.
In a vertical position we put numbers... and the numbers go from 1 to 17, and then we have the alphabet.
It's a cross situation where an animal... say, Bonnie... would be 9-W.
What that would mean is that the people would go to Row 9... then they'd go to "W"... and where those two points crossed...
you would have the location.
This opportunity doesn't mean a damn thing to you... unless you're willing to work hard... to study, to be a student... and to apply your experience, and to do better constantly.
So I think that's what my father's done for many years.
And I know, I've seen his successes.
He's read the same textbooks I have.
Danny is basically doing the same thing.
And this is what I have to do.
I have to learn to put this knowledge into reality.
"The basic tenet of our church...
"the Bubbling Well Church of Universal Love...
"incorporated in January of 1977 is...
"the Church has as its tenets...
"a belief in a supreme being who does not differentiate...
"in bestowing his benevolence on all species of life...
"whether of this earth or any form of life hereafter."
The thought occurred to me...
that any god, any supreme being...
that was indeed compassionate
and concerned about people...
would surely be concerned
about any living creature.
God is supposed to know
when the sparrow falls...
when the lilies of the field bloom.
So surely, at the gates of heaven...
an all-compassionate god...
or an all-compassionate supreme
being is surely not going to say:
"Well, you're walking in on two legs,
you can go in.
"You're walking in on four legs,
we can't take you."
I don't believe this will happen.
Now people come up and there is a common bond.
At the church, we don't have formal services.
We're not trying to save any souls or collect money or anything like that.
It's sort of a church of love.
We do not have to go too far afield to make this conversion... because we have our own chapel... we have stained-glass windows, we even have a bell.
We're usually talking in terms of death and talking in terms of hereafter.
Well, this is the very essence of any other religion.
So if in the hereafter there are no pets,
I think...
I don't think any of us that love our pets would really... feel, maybe...
I can't say we wouldn't want to go, but...
I really believe that they'll all be there in spirit with all of us.
The pet owners that we have talked to... have embraced the idea... and it has had a very dramatic effect on a lot of them.
It's brought them assurance, it makes sense.
And it's not...
It's very hard to refute it, as a matter of fact... because it makes sense.
You don't have to depend on a lot of... mystical type of thinking.
It just makes sense.
And people at this time are looking for assurance.
They don't want pie in the sky, they don't want fairytales.
Trooper was the type of dog that didn't have other dogs to relate to.
He lived with adult human beings.
And having the inability... to communicate like human beings do through conversation... he did it with his mannerisms, his eyes, and reception.
One of the things that you noticed with him... was when we were sitting in a room, he would position himself... and as each one of us spoke... the tone of their voices would direct his attention to that person.
And during the course of the conversation... if the conversation was pleasant, he would react to that... or if it was sharp, he would react to that.
And he also had a sense as to what the subject of the conversation was.
In particular, at Christmas time...
the discussion about gifts
to various members of the family.
And there were certain things
that we knew he would like...
as to doggy bones
and little chewy things that he had.
We didn't conceive that he would be aware of our conversation... but we were relating to him, because as I say... there was no one else he could talk and relate to except ourselves.
Christmas morning, in fact, this was just before his death...
we all came down to open our presents...
they were all laid out in various
sections around the Christmas tree.
And we would hand each one of us a gift... particularly, my mother-in-law, her being the elder of the family... we'd bring her presents.
He lined himself up and couldn't wait... and he went right to the direction of where his packages were... and started unwrapping them, right in there... they were not laid out in the open.
And he unwrapped his presents just like sharing with all of us there.
It's amazing that there are so many different aspects of this.
It's not just, you know, an opening in the ground... somebody prefers a casket or not... and the ground is put back into the opening. No.
Sometimes the people like to come up, witness the actual burial of the animal.
Sometimes they don't.
We pick out a date that's convenient for them and they come up.
As far as preparation, a hole has to be dug, prepared.
We have to make sure that the hole is going to fit the size of the casket.
You don't want to make it too large because you'll waste space.
And you don't want to make it too small or you can't get it in there.
Mentally, I don't worry about putting an animal down into an opening... because if I don't do it, somebody else will have to do it.
It's just mind over matter.
You have to prepare yourself for it.
We pick up animals that are 150 pounds, greyhounds.
They're very heavy.
We have to bring them in to our bodies... to be able to hoist them into the truck.
It's mind over matter once again.
Sometimes they come in,
when we get them...
their hair is matted...
and they're very moist from
being in a freezer where they're kept.
So they have to be combed and dried out a bit.
It isn't the most pleasant thing in the world. But it's not that bad, really.
After a while it becomes something that doesn't really bother you at all.
But I don't know what happens
down there. I really don't.
The moisture, the contraction,
the expansion of the ground...
of course, the insects
and so on and so forth.
There's another world down there,
you know.
He'd go down on his front knees, and I knew something drastic...
He'd just black out.
Just fall over and black out, just for a few seconds.
- Then he'd get back up again.
- Ready to go.
We took him down to the vets.
We had test after test.
They couldn't find nothing.
One day we took him back to the same vet... because that vet, he's darn good, we liked him a lot.
He called us up, said, "I've found out what's wrong with York."
- "He has heartworms."
- Heartworms.
I'm telling you, if I never tell anybody anything else again... please watch your dogs for heartworm.
It's carried by mosquitoes... just like your malaria. And you don't know.
We used to think we were free from it here.
But we're not. It was a Southern disease.
But here in California, it's very prevalent.
I ask myself, " What does this mean to me?
"What does this park, this opportunity mean to me?"
Well, it means a lot.
It means that I'll be able to... have something to work for for many years to come.
It will provide the things that I will need... the long line of the other things, events.
Phil has moved into the business.
He's slowly learning it.
He's learning the route right now and he'll be taking that over.
But at the same time, he's learning about the private burials... he's learning about handling the people... because there's definitely things you have to know... to be able to talk to the people about their pets.
You have to see by example,
you have to learn by example.
We're working together.
We have our ups and downs.
He's a bit older than I am.
It provides some hardships because
I'm the one telling him what to do...
and he doesn't always like that.
He resents it at times.
My father is in charge of the park.
He's El Presidento, you know.
He's Number One.
Danny, by virtue of seniority and knowledge is Number Two.
I guess I would be the third person.
My father now is trying to work out of the business...
because he's getting on in years,
and he wants to do a little traveling...
before he passes on.
So he's letting up
and he's letting me take over...
the handling of the people
and he's staying in the background.
Although, I don't think he'll ever stay
completely in the background...
because he's a fairly dominant person.
Then he came out of it, and he was perfectly normal... and racing through Golden Gate Park along the ocean beach.
And then just as suddenly,
we took him over for a checkup...
to recheck the prior prognosis.
They thought he was all right.
He came home on a Wednesday.
And I can recall he was so relieved
to get out of that veterinarian office...
having been in there all day.
He had a habit to me.
I always got a kiss on the knee area.
I recall that as probably the last time I remember him doing that.
And then, just as suddenly as the kiss... he seemed to go right down, and we kept phoning the vets... and they said not to worry... that they didn't like to eat when they were under medication... but to bring him in on Monday.
But, before that happened, we ran him to the Animal Emergency Hospital... and to Dr. Benjamin there.
It was too late. He was gone by then.
He just passed away on the Sunday after it.
But the main thing is for people who have dogs... and they don't breed them... the most intelligent thing
I would recommend would be... when the dog is,
I suppose the same for cats... about two or three years old... that is the time to make a decision to have them...
Neutered.
You keep that idea of building this place up, of fixing it up... and eventually it will be something that nothing else can compare with.
That idea keeps the whole thing together.
That concept is what keeps us together, I think.
My dad used to tell me when I was a young kid...
I'd look at a job that had to be done, and he'd say, "Nothing's impossible."
That stuck in my craw. I couldn't believe it. "Nothing's impossible."
I learned when I got in the insurance business... that everything is possible.
It's just you have to look at it with the right frame of mind.
And that's important, your mind.
There's a tendency to sit on your laurels... and be somewhat complacent... about small advances and small accomplishments.
Or even sometimes large accomplishments... have a tendency to put you at ease.
However, this is a trap.
Because we are not content... with just having an ordinary... nice, or good pet cemetery.
Ours is going to be the finest.
We're not going to stop until ours is the finest in the country.
There'll be no finer when we're through.
When I'd hire a guy...
I'd bring him into my office.
And I had specifically designed my office so I could display... the maximum trophies on walls and stuff.
I bring this guy in, who had probably been making $9,000 a year or less.
I'd bring him into this office with nice furniture.
He'd see these trophies, and, you know...
They were taken away.
It's kind of like flaunting it, I guess.
To hire him all I did was tell stories about what each trophy meant to me... what it could mean to him... and if he would like to increase his income and his future.
The names of our gardens were created... by words that seemed to depict... the qualities of pets, like our Garden of Companionship.
A pet is a companion.
The Garden of Devotion.
Almost all pets are devoted to their masters.
The Garden of the Gentle Giants, again, is descriptive.
Kitty Kurve, the Reserve Garden set aside... and reserved for smaller pets.
The Garden of Memory... is set aside... because it will bring happy memories in the future, we hope.
We had a Valentine's Day party for all the wives.
I think there was about six of us.
I told the guys to come over.
We were going to have a cake and celebrate Valentine's Day.
So we got a big cake and all the wives came.
I had this motivational meeting planned.
You know, they didn't know exactly what was going on.
And I had all these signs on the wall.
I had made up a chart, a commitment chart.
Anyway, we had the cake and we had the girls talk... and we read the material... the motivational material for prizes and trophies... to be won the subsequent week.
We got the girls motivated.
And the girls got the guys motivated.
We created the Garden of Honor.
And in this garden we will bury... a Seeing Eye dog or a police dog killed in the line of duty... at no cost... if it's killed in the line of duty.
And for anybody else who wants to share this garden... then we created a price... which amounts to more than any other garden that we have.
I think that I'm motivated all the time... because I have so many experiences... of motivation. I understand it quite well.
One thing that this gentleman... to my left always said, and it sticks in my brain all the time is that:
"The emotions are not always subject to reason...
"but they are always subject to action."
We all have periods of inertia where we don't want to get up and do things.
So I have to tell myself psychologically:
"It's going to be a great day,
I'll have a great day today."
And I repeat it over and over. And actually do the thing with that in mind.
I've been trying to teach it to my brother.
As a matter of fact, couple of months ago, I wrote him a letter.
I tried to write him a very motivational letter.
Because at the time he was very inspirationally dissatisfied.
I don't go out very much... so what I do to pass the time... aside from watching television, of course... is I would sit down and put these tracks down on tape... and just play guitar.
It's something that gives me a lot of personal satisfaction.
With any type of a musical instrument, you're never going to be bored.
So much of the time, people say,
"What am I going to do?
"There's nothing to do." They're always continually complaining.
But with a musical instrument, you can sit down... and you can provide your own entertainment.
Even my kids.
I try to abstain from the word "not"... and "can't," and "no," and stuff like that, which are very negative words.
And try to instill, rather than physical punishment... but just saying...
My youngest girl is two and a half years old... and it's very hard for her to understand the language, rationalize it.
I sit her down when she's done something wrong and I say:
"Good girls don't do this.
"Good girls do things that make us happy."
We created our little lakes... because we feel this gives an atmosphere of tranquility... and helps to break up the rows of little headstones...
which can be very monotonous
and not too appealing.
In former years, I would write three or four songs a week... and I've got a little notebook... where I've got about probably 50 songs.
You always have the dream in the back of your mind... that someday these songs will be published and you'll be famous.
But as you get older, you start realizing... that maybe those are just what they were, dreams. Nothing more.
Dreams are nice to have.
Something to look forward to.
It gives you more satisfaction.
Something you can think about.
Our mind is like a computer.
You know, if our mind read... or extracted a data-line from it... if you put in positive, you would get out positive.
If you put in negative, you'd get out negative.
So you have to understand that.
Our mind is...
We can go into a negative part... and into a positive part... and if you want to get more involved, there's an in-between:
Where people never get really negative and people never really get positive... what they call "gray area."
But the mind reacts to suggestion.
And suggestion is merely... an external force or an external thing... that you perceive through your senses.
You know, like your smell, your sight, your feeling.
You could even be smelling a big vat of spaghetti... you know, and it suggests to you that you're hungry.
So therefore, our strongest power... that we have is in suggestion.
In the power of prayer.
That's the strongest power that we have.
Success is like a journey.
And when you finally achieve success
in your given field...
the journey's over. You have to look
for something else to motivate you.
There was a famous doctor who was
one of the first to climb Mt. Everest.
Right at the end
he looked up at the mountain...
The first time he tried it, he failed.
And as he was coming down
from the mountain, he looked at it...
and said, "I'll climb Mt. Everest."
He says, "Mountains don't grow,
but men always will."
There's a principle of law that with every benefit there's a burden.
And the responsibility that you have with a dog...
It's not just an inanimate object.
In our life today, we do focus a lot of our attention... on material things such as automobiles, clothes... trips, and things of that sort.
And even objects, paintings... and other kinds of things at home that you cherish.
Well, an animal, I think, much more so, you cherish... because he does respond to you.
He doesn't talk like a human being... but he is much more than just an inanimate object.
Therefore, the responsibility that a person has to the animal... you sense that when you have them.
Because their love and affection comes to you.
And that love and affection, over a period of years... becomes a part of your life.
And you can't discard them... to such a degree like you can a wrapper around some food... and say, "Well, it's finished and it disappeared."
When a dog dies suddenly like Trooper died... the moment of decision came.
"What do we do with him?"
I could only think of Trooper's face... and he'd say,
"Where are you going to put me?"
There's something to life...
that even when you discard something
of an inanimate nature...
you dispose of it
with some kind of reverence.
I've got a stereo system aside from a recording system.
It's a Pioneer SX-1010.
It's 100 watts per channel, which is very powerful.
On some occasions... say late afternoon, when there's nobody at the park...
I'll take my speakers and I'll put them outside... and turn it up.
You can hear it.
It goes through the whole valley.
You can hear it from miles away.
I think we'll all be together again.
I think we're going to live pretty much like we do here.
I want to be able to find my pets.
I don't want them dug up and scattered all over creation.
I want them right where I know where they are... where it's like in humming fields like they've had in this life.
I believe that we'll all be reunited.
I really do. I believe that from the bottom of my heart.
She's got me believing that now,
I never believed in it before.
But I still do.
'Cause after all, there's your dog.
Your dog's dead.
But where's the thing that made it move?
It had to be something, didn't it?
There's your spirit. There it is.
I might be dead, but I'm not moving.
And you can't put that back in them.
But I can take the body where it will be with it and lay it to rest.
It's a beautiful thing.
It can rest there or be right around there. It'll stay close.
It'll stay where he is, and I'll find it again.
I really will. They'll be with us.
I hope she's right.
I think I'm right.
In fact, I almost know I'm right.
- You'd bet on it, huh?
- I'd bet a lot on it.
My assurance to the pet owners... is that they will be reunited with their pet... at some time in the future.
Maybe under different circumstances and in a different form... as remote as this might be and as hard as it is for them to visualize... it still gives them a degree of hope.
{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D

{12397}{12422}Lunch.
{12428}{12502}I need another pair of pants.
{12508}{12568}You didn't?
{12570}{12650}I burst the seat of my pants.
{18781}{18856}We never did get it right on stage|because we... It was retarded...
{18862}{18934}...and I wanted it quick.
{19216}{19315}I wanted the group to say "heart away".

{30312}{30376}Here he comes.
{30412}{30478}Hi, Phil.
{30499}{30530}They say ignore these cameras.
{30536}{30584}- Where's Gigi?|- Gigi is no longer with us.
{30590}{30627}You've got to be kidding!
{30633}{30656}He had to quit.
{30662}{30780}See, what happened, Gigi was married|and had a baby, an infant...
{30786}{30840}...and he had a little boy back in Memphis.
{30846}{30908}So he had to leave the little boy|in Memphis, because...
{30914}{30973}...his wife's parents|were keeping the little boy...
{30979}{31042}...and they wouldn't let him|take him out of town.
{31048}{31112}So, they had one child in California,|and one back there.
{31118}{31191}They were traveling back and forth|and it was too much for him.
{31197}{31267}But if it was his child.|Can't he take his child with him?
{31273}{31325}It's not really his child, it was...
{31331}{31404}...his wife's child by a previous marriage.
{31410}{31511}- And she couldn't take him?|- She wouldn't take him away.
{31517}{31573}- It was just a family thing. He quit.|- Yeah.
{31579}{31702}- I sure hated to lose him 'cause...|- I know he hated to go, too.
{32088}{32118}{y:i}Okay.
{32124}{32201}{y:i}The horns are answering it here.
{32238}{32296}{y:i}Right on top of "friend".

{33011}{33031}{y:i}Right.
{33037}{33159}{y:i}I'd like to point out a problem.|{y:i}When it switches, it sounds like...
{33162}{33240}{y:i}When it switches, it sounds like|{y:i}some of the guys are just lost...
{33246}{33368}{y:i}... which is the way it is,|{y:i}but we don't have to emphasize it.
{33438}{33518}- I made a mistake.|{y:i}- It's all right.
{33537}{33640}{y:i}I wanna try something.|{y:i}This is the last verse.
{36155}{36218}{y:i}We can do a yodel.
{40362}{40424}{y:i}Play that song.
{41582}{41652}{y:i}Sing it slow.
{42041}{42076}Mary in the Morning.
{42082}{42148}{y:i}"Mary at suppertime"

{42754}{42809}{y:i}James, one minute, man.
{42815}{42927}{y:i}Wait a minute.|{y:i}They don't tell you when to start.
{42994}{43102}{y:i}Like a big old screaming eagle|{y:i}out there, man.
{43191}{43285}{y:i}You can't use those words.|{y:i}They'll cut it right out.
{43291}{43316}{y:i}They'll cut it out.
{43322}{43419}{y:i}They'll put an X rating|{y:i}right across your big mouth.
{43437}{43476}{y:i}"Mouth" I said.
{43482}{43578}{y:i}That shows how you think.|{y:i}I wouldn't say that.
{43593}{43658}{y:i}They'll cut that out. They won't leave it in.
{43664}{43756}{y:i}You can't say "big ass" in this family.
{43847}{43921}"Okay." Mary in the Morning.
{46347}{46408}{y:i}Sing it again.
{46664}{46738}{y:i}Just a chord.
{47166}{47274}You only got about another 45 minutes|of sitting around.
{47292}{47386}I know you've been great,|but listen to this.
{47512}{47584}That's the wildest laugh.
{47629}{47711}That's about how I feel.
{47941}{48024}No wonder he can't have a good time.|He's reading telegrams while we talk.
{48030}{48124}"Here's hoping you have a very successful|opening and that you break both legs."
{48130}{48186}- Goddamn!|- Tom Jones.
{48192}{48288}"My God, my God,|why hast thou forsaken me?"
{48330}{48405}Signed, "The Pope".
{48447}{48519}"Best wishes for a continuing|successful Vegas show."
{48525}{48636}"I hope you get a raise|in the next six months, Joyce Brazil."
{48706}{48785}Don't pick your nose on camera.
{48827}{48917}Don't pick your nose on camera, man.
{48950}{49039}It starts to get tense about this time.
{49116}{49179}I just hope I don't forget the words to...
{49185}{49296}..."I Just Can't Help Believin'".|I hope I don't forget the words.
{49420}{49489}Right there, that's the first verse.|You got the rest of it.
{49495}{49545}If I get through the first one, I get it.
{49551}{49624}Very proud. Nice to see you.|Hope you enjoy our show tonight.
{49630}{49686}- Have you seen Elvis before?|- I've seen him twice.
{49692}{49730}Good. We've a better show tonight.
{49736}{49829}Well, he was absolutely fantastic that time.
{49878}{49939}Nice to see you tonight.|Nice to have you with us.
{49945}{49997}Glad to have you aboard|to see Elvis tonight.
{50003}{50069}Well, of course.|He sings those Spanish songs like nobody.
{50075}{50089}Hello!
{50095}{50165}Mrs. Xavier Cugat.|How are you? Good to see you.
{50171}{50224}You came to see Elvis?
{50230}{50304}You should've seen me at dinner tonight.|I was going...
{50310}{50379}In tempo.
{50391}{50490}I never swallowed any of it.|It was all right here.
{50547}{50594}Hello, how are you?
{50600}{50690}I came to see that "pectoral destruction".
{50864}{50926}If the songs don't go well,|we can do a medley of...
{50932}{51002}We can pray.
{51059}{51111}- Has the show started yet?|- Yes.
{51117}{51213}- Who's on?|- Sammy says bring in the machine.
{51426}{51527}Straight vodka, man, it's good for you.
{52438}{52574}We could put the words of|"I Just Can't Help Believin'" on that stool.
{56503}{56552}{y:i}That's it, you know. I just...
{56558}{56630}{y:i}Tapers off to nothing.
{60090}{60161}{y:i}I knew a song about...
{60166}{60250}{y:i}I don't know, when I was a baby.
{60302}{60414}{y:i}You got to lean on your knee, like this.|{y:i}Like a fool.
{60602}{60698}{y:i}It's a very tender love song. It's a ballad.
{60704}{60794}{y:i}You get up into a girl's face,|{y:i}you know, very close...
{60800}{60826}{y:i}... and you say:
{60832}{60896}{y:i}"Yeah!"
{60922}{61004}{y:i}And it blows her hair straight back.
{62942}{62981}{y:i}You know, when I first started...
{62987}{63044}{y:i}... in this business...
{63050}{63091}{y:i}... I was a little, bitty guy...
{63097}{63169}{y:i}... with a shaky leg.
{63169}{63223}{y:i}So, Ed Sullivan saw me and said:
{63229}{63301}{y:i}"Son of a bitch."
{63427}{63491}{y:i}Anyway, they put me on TV|{y:i}and filmed me from the waist up.
{63497}{63571}{y:i}You know, I'm going...
{63626}{63720}{y:i}Anyway, MGM is doing a movie...
{63723}{63781}{y:i}... called...
{63787}{63875}...Elvis Loses his Excess.
{63908}{63982}{y:i}"Shakes his Excess Off", or whatever it is.
{63988}{64072}{y:i}So don't let these cameras throw you.
{64075}{64152}{y:i}Give me an E, or a G, or an F, or a D.
{64158}{64239}{y:i}Or a B-flat minor, plus one.
{64267}{64320}{y:i}I don't know what I'm talking about.
{64326}{64413}{y:i}If you milk this thing long enough...
{64494}{64579}{y:i}I'll put this in front of you, Ronnie.
{65786}{65846}{y:i}Play it, Jim.
{67384}{67458}{y:i}I made a movie about it.
{67598}{67693}{y:i}What are you laughing at?|{y:i}This is my first guitar. I was little.
{67699}{67736}{y:i}I told you.
{67742}{67807}{y:i}Little bitty cat,|{y:i}trying to get people to listen to me.
{67813}{67883}{y:i}Listen to me, I'm good.
{67978}{68029}{y:i}Not with that voice, you ain't.
{68035}{68095}{y:i}Anyway...
{68312}{68405}{y:i}Anyway, my first movie,|{y:i}ladies and gentlemen.
{68452}{68535}{y:i}That's really this guitar doing that.
{69401}{69466}{y:i}How you doing, sir?
{69480}{69525}{y:i}Thank you.
{69531}{69601}{y:i}Are you afraid of me?
{70539}{70626}{y:i}Hang loose, I'll be with you in a minute.
{70962}{71030}{y:i}I'll be over there.
{73878}{73964}{y:i}Sorry I couldn't make it up there.
{74534}{74611}{y:i}Take it home, baby!
{74801}{74826}{y:i}That's it.
{74832}{74905}{y:i}Thank you very much.
{75047}{75106}{y:i}Everybody ready?
{75112}{75164}{y:i}I'm not.
{75170}{75235}{y:i}I'm not.
{75271}{75334}{y:i}Okay.
{78550}{78584}{y:i}What you got there?
{78590}{78664}{y:i}What's that look for?
{78670}{78693}{y:i}Picture of me?
{78699}{78728}{y:i}That's very nice.
{78734}{78812}{y:i}Looks like Engelbert Humperdinck.
{78850}{78883}{y:i}Yeah, sure will.
{78889}{78932}{y:i}Time-out, folks. Just one second.
{78938}{79034}{y:i}Bahija. Is that your name?
{79143}{79193}{y:i}- You want me to have this one?|- Do you like it?
{79199}{79248}{y:i}Thank you very much. Yes, it's very nice.
{79254}{79331}{y:i}I can't do that. I'm sorry.
{79362}{79430}{y:i}Hang loose, you'll get it back.
{79436}{79498}{y:i}Okay.
{79498}{79542}{y:i}I just did a country and western album.
{79548}{79601}{y:i}In it is a song. It's called:
{79607}{79681}Just Pretend.
{84869}{84953}{y:i}Thank you. Thank you very much.
{84978}{85040}{y:i}Thank you.
{87278}{87344}{y:i}Play the song, James.
{92473}{92548}{y:i}One, two, three, four!
{103174}{103255}{y:i}What are you looking at back there?
{109751}{109814}{y:i}Thank you.
{110036}{110096}{y:i}Good evening.
{110140}{110196}{y:i}Just grab hold, honey, anywhere.
{110202}{110234}{y:i}There you go.
{110240}{110306}{y:i}Hi, little girl.
{110337}{110413}{y:i}Oh, what's the matter, baby?
{110508}{110573}Please, kiss me!
{110600}{110660}I love you!
{110699}{110739}{y:i}Okay. Sure.
{110745}{110841}{y:i}You want to get serious|{y:i}or just play a little bit?
{110932}{110994}{y:i}Okay.
{113682}{113781}{y:i}If we start doing those,|{y:i}we'll be up here all night.
{116049}{116111}{y:i}Okay.
{116979}{117058}{y:i}Play the song, James.
{123049}{123123}{y:i}Thank you very much. Water.

{132198}{132235}{y:i}Fantastic audience.
{132241}{132315}{y:i}Thank you very much.
{135674}{135728}- Hello, Elvis.|- Glad to meet you.
{135734}{135815}Harry, what have you got on?
{135834}{135925}The show was beautiful.
{135961}{136052}How you doing? Nice to meet you.
{136089}{136158}I've made it back, huh?
{136164}{136230}I almost put it off, because...
{136236}{136327}I was a little too nervous at first.
{136454}{136495}The show was beautiful.
{136501}{136597}You were terrific. You did all my moves.
{136709}{136775}- How are you? Good to see you.|- Good to see you.
{136781}{136827}You've met my wife before, I think.
{136833}{136876}- It was a great show.|- Thank you.
{136882}{136981}- It was a sweaty show.|- You worked awfully hard.
{136987}{137070}Maybe too hard, I don't know.
{137213}{137282}I don't know, but he started to rev up.
{137288}{137395}You started to rev up,|and it never stopped.
{137433}{137530}- Hi, I'm Ann.|- Nice to meet you.

[Orson welles] for my next experiment, ladies and gentlemen...
I would appreciate the loan of any small personal object from your pocket- a key or a box of matches, a coin.
Ah, a key it is. Good sir.
Hold it up 10 feet over your head.
And watch out for the slightest hint of hanky-panky.
And behold, before our very eyes... a transformation.
We've changed your key... into a coin.
What happened to the key?
It's been returned to you.
Look closely, sir.
You'll find the key... back in your pocket.
May we see it, please?
Up to your old tricks, I see.
Why not? I'm a charlatan.
What's that, sir?
Did I used to be a magician?
Sir, I'm still working on it.
As for the key, it was not symbolic of anything.
This isn't that kind of movie.
You'll find the coin now in your pocket, sir.
Keep your eyes on that coin, sir... while it's returned to you as your key.
Shall we return you to your mother?
Is this your mother? No, of course not.
Open your mouth, wide... and we'll return you your money.
And by the way, have you ever heard of Robert-Houdin?
Speaking of magicians, I mean?
No, of course not.
- But of course you do know my partner,
François Reichenbach?
- Hello.
Houdin was the greatest magician who ever lived.
And do you know what he said?
- "A magician," he said, "is just an actor."
- Well, good luck to you.
Just an actor playing the part of a magician.
- [François] very nice.
- And she's fabulously rich too.
- There's a good story about it.
- Do you want to tell it?
We'll come to that one later.
No, it's time for an introduction.
Ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction... this is a film about trickery and fraud... about lies.
Tell it by the fireside or in a marketplace or in a movie... almost any story is almost certainly... some kind of lie.
But not this time.
No, this is a promise.
During the next hour, everything you'll hear from us is really true... and based on solid facts.
You don't talk about napoleon or Julius Caesar.
- You're talking about Elmyr.
- [Welles] Elmyr?
- Elmyr?
- [Welles] who is Elmyr?
That question has yet to be answered with any real precision.
- Can I kiss you too?
- Certainly.
Anybody want to eat?
[Welles] in the world of the jet-setters, among us beautiful people... everybody knows Elmyr, but Elmyr what?
- He has about 60 time the same name.
- [Welles] de hory?
He's called his name hory, heury, bory, sury, kury, bury, dury-all the -
[speaking french]
With put u-r-y. Sixty names.
- His real name was Elmyr Ferenc Huffman.
- Then 60 personalities... as much lies and as much real.
Well, it sounds very jesuitical.
Yes, his world is a world of make-believe.
- I'm not an actor.
- Not an actor? Elmyr?
I'm not an actor.
- I am not a professional actor.
- [Welles] he's a leading actor in this movie.
His profession, it's true, is painting-painting fakes.
Among all fakers,
Elmyr is number two.
[François]
Once I saw a man from Ibiza... writing a book on fake, who came to see me to Paris.
He said, "I heard you are the first man who bought an Elmyr."
- [Welles] and that man's name was-
- Clifford Irving.
[Man] the important distinction to make when you're talking about... the genuine quality of a painting... is not so much whether it's a real painting or a fake.
It's whether it's a good fake or a bad fake.

[Welles]
Her name... is Oja, Oja Kodar.
And this, by the way, is from quite another film... a sequence on the fine outdoor sport of girl-watching.
Our sneaky crew of cameramen hidden away in camouflaged trucks and packing boxes... arranged for her to act for them.
To act as bait.
[Heels tapping]
You see how it worked.
The entire cast... all the performers, except one... acting away like crazy for us without getting paid for it...
- without even knowing they were movie actors.
- Mama mia.!
- Simple larceny. Well, maybe not simple.
- Mama mia.!
That year nothing was simple... least of all the larceny.
Now in this little gag,
Lawrence Harvey... our leading man from yet another movie... couldn't arrange space for miss Kodar on a plane.
Well, there's no room in this movie to tell you why in that other one... we squeezed miss Kodar into a more convenient size for traveling... by a magical illusion.
But you really must believe that what comes afterwards is solid fact.
Yes, after this bit of hocus-pocus, the next thing we heard about her... was not as an actress... but as the leading figure in a notorious swindle.
I took another plane, grew another beard... made another movie and well before miss Kodar- we'll leave miss Kodar aside for the moment.
But in case that mumbojumbo might make it seem... that there's going to be some trickery in this film about trickery... we'll repeat our promise... in writing.
The girl-watching was evidence of how much of all this was filmed... in blissful ignorance of the facts... about some of the various characters... who found their way in front of our cameras.
Well, Clifford Irving told the story in the book.
[Welles]
Maybe.
Well, by now, you understand,
I'd fallen in with François.
And on the island of Ibiza... we'd fallen smack into the biggest series of scandals... in the whole history of hoaxing.
It was a pretty queer experience to start making yet another movie... and end up making yet another... with a story line rotten with coincidence.
For instance, that the author of fake! A book about a faker... was himself a faker and the author of a fake to end all fakes- and that he must have been cooking it up when we were filming him.
- [Sighs] well.
- [Man] quiet, please. Edith Irving.
- Take three.
- Look, you've known Elmyr longer than anyone else on this island.
Do you really believe he did all those fakes?
- No, I really don't believe it.
- [Welles] sorry.
I've been jumping around like this because that's the way it was.
- [Man] Clifford Irving, take two.
- [Welles chuckles]
Let's pull ourselves together if we can and begin at the beginning.
Now, on this tablecloth, which is decorated with a map, is where everything-
- [crew laughing]
- Which I've just loused up with some wine.
But I understand wine brings good luck behind the ear.
Well, we can use a little luck anywhere.
And here is -
I'll have to mark it in.
On this tiny island is where the two great hoaxes were hatched - Ibiza.
One island, two Ibizas.
The serious, indeed, the very sober part... is part of Spain.
And the other, "an island in the sun," life magazine calls it...
"where restless souls may find each other."
The restless souls being, I guess... cliff Irving, over there- and Elmyr.
Coincidence number one:
That these two world leaders in fakery... operated, quite separately, on the same tiny island.
That's Mrs. Irving.
Elmyr and Mrs. Irving.
[Man on TV] Clifford Irving, who declared that he himself... had delivered to
Howard Hughes or his aides... the quarter of a million dollars publisher's advance... suddenly confessed today that Mrs. Irving... is the same Helga r. Hughes wanted by the police -
[man on TV speaking Spanish]
[Continues in Spanish]
"If Clifford dragged Edith into this, "said Elmyr...
"I spit on his face."
This was later, of course, when everything was finally hanging out... or as much of it as I guess any of us will ever get to see.
And then we had to stop these Moviolas, use them as time machines... and then roll back and come in again... to the days when Clifford Irving, as far as any of us knew...
- was just a researcher into someone else's fakery.
- [Cuckoo clock cuckoos]
And now for the truth, Clifford.
We'd like to ask you a few question.
My personal feelings about Elmyr are... very mixed.
He has developed a fiction about his life... and to destroy that fiction... would tear down the whole castle that he's built... of his illusions.
The illusion, for example, that he has not broken any law.
As long as people enjoy it... and it gives them pleasure, why shouldn't they have it?
The illusion that the world has always taken advantage of him.
- Why they shouldn't have it? Why?
- If you were to put it to Elmyr... that he had taken advantage of the world... that he had cheated people, he'd be horrified.
[Welles] these two have made each other famous.
They have much in common:
- One of them is talent.
- [Moviola rattling]
Well, let's start again.
We'll patch this film together... and we'll try to patch together
Elmyr's version of this story.
[Elmyr]
I came to Ibiza in 1959... after I found certain aspects of my life in America... becoming too difficult.
I wandered around Europe for a time.
I eventually came here.
I liked life here.
I liked the island.
I liked the atmosphere. I liked the people.
And so I decided that is the place where I want to settle.
The island is, uh, simpatico... as they say in Chinese.
There is always a group of interesting people here.
Uh, I find the people amusing.
Sandy, come and say something witty.
[Elmyr] Ibiza is not a place for snobbish society.
It's not London.
It's not Paris. It's not Omaha.
It is Ibiza, and that's the charm of Ibiza.
That's what makes Ibiza why we like to live here.
Ibiza is Ibiza, and here people are themselves, you know... doing rather strange things all the time, you know.
So they shouldn't really be shocked.
- And, uh, everybody minds everybody else's business very intensely.
- [No audible dialogue]
[Man]
Several months ago, I read an article... about Elmyr de hory... and I was so impressed... that I decided to come from Minnesota... to Ibiza... in the hope of meeting Elmyr.
And now I have become... his bodyguard.
[Welles]
That's mark speaking, Elmyr's friend.
He takes his duties seriously.
Elmyr himself swears that he goes in daily dread of being murdered.
This takes us into murky waters... where the lawyers tell us we'd be rash to go fishing.
In fake! There's just a hint or two about this violence and danger... as a result of which, Irving, on top of all his other troubles... is being sued for
$55 million worth of slander.
Interesting question: Is Clifford Irving being sued for telling the truth?
What makes a slight legal difference - well, if you buy the notion that cliff Irving turned to forgery... before he turned to Elmyr... then I guess you can keep right on through the looking glass... and believe that his book about Elmyr is a pack of lies.
I'm sorry.
A lie about what?
That fake.! Is a fake, and Elmyr himself... is a fake... faker.
- Fake fakes! [chuckles]
- [Welles] fake, nothing.
Elmyr's a true faker.
Here, for instance, is a van dongen by Elmyr.
Van dongen studied it carefully... and then swore that he'd painted it himself.
He's now known as the greatest art forger in the world.
Well, I don't admit anything,
I just talk about it.
'Cause he's scared. You know, there could be a jail sentence hanging over his head.
[Welles]
"Elmyr,"cries a french newspaper...
"has sold his soul to the devil."
They said that about a wizard of the fiddle.
Elmyr's another wizard of another sort of fiddle- a true Paganini of the palette.
It's no wonder that a faker like Elmyr... can get away with it for 22 years.
If you hang them in a museum or your collection of great paintings... and if they hang long enough there, they become real.
[Irving] because there's always a market for it.
[Welles] how much is that drawing worth on the market today?
[Elmyr]
Probably around $8,000 till $10,000.
[Irving] to my knowledge, he has never made a mistake... when identifying a painting.
- [Welles] what period is that Matisse?
- [Elmyr] uh, '36.
I, uh, feel that we should burn it.
[Irving] when he looks at a painting- a Matisse, a Chagall- and says, "that's mine, I did it," he is always right.
[Welles]
Elmyr.
There is just no way of talking about Elmyr... and leaving out cliff Irving.
Not any longer.
Right up to the finish...
Elmyr plays a very important role in his biographer's own story.
Now, just here, of course, he's stage center.
Willkommen.! Willkommen.
[Welles] and Irving, who, I'll have to admit... is a much better magician than I am... has yet to transform himself before our very eyes... into a superstar.
François, you know, we talk about your shirt, Reichenbach.
It was indecently ugly.
- [Laughing]
- I can assure you.
[Speaking french]
- [Irving] I must tell you something.
I went to the airport today.
- Oh.
I picked up a copy of the London daily express.
And there was an article:
"Exposed: A man who holds the art world to ransom."
- [Woman] exposed.! Darling, we can't have you exposed.!
- "Sitting in the sunny studio -"
[speaking french]
[Irving] and then it goes on to tell the story of how I took the Modigliani...
- to the metropolitan museum of art"-
- there's a big article!
"A profound embarrassment to them all."
Elmyr is a profound embarrassment to them all.
[Speaking french]
The art world, as it were, has been... a huge confidence trick.
"Exposed: A man who holds the art world to ransom."
[Woman laughing]
- "Sitting in the sunny studio of his £60,000 villa...
- it's fantastic.
"On the Mediterranean island of Ibiza...
"it took Elmyr dory-boutin, the world's greatest art forger... just one hour to draw an original Modigliani."
Today, on a sale, it would bring somewhere around...
There was really no time when he ever could have done it.
And also as a man, how I knew him... it was all much more a joke.
[Welles] the world has yet to hear a word about that wig she wore in the Swiss bank.
There hasn't been a breath about funny passports... or phony signatures, and here's Edith... telling Clifford Irving that she can't believe Elmyr... had anything to do with fakery.
[Edith] therefore I never could think or will even think now... that he sat down and did those paintings.
- [Elmyr] it's a good drawing.
- [Edith] If he did it, my compliment.
- Should we burn it?
- [Edith] and I only hope there are more people who do them.
[Welles]
Irving's book about Elmyr... is the story of a man of talent taking the mickey out of those who had rejected him... translating disappointments into a gigantic joke.
- [Laughing]
- You think I should keep it for my old age? [chuckles]
All right, I will.
So I put it back in.
[Irving] you're a painter.
Why do you want people to do fakes?
Because the fakes are as good as the real ones... and there's a market, and there's a demand.
If you didn't have an art market, then fakers could not exist.
- So, the more, the better. No?
- [Irving] if you say so.
[Welles]
Here's another little coincidence.
A peculiar moment during a lunch party.
And in Switzerland, checks are not accepted.
You pay cash on the table.
- That's Switzerland. You are Swiss.
- [Laughing]
And you know it.
[Edith] if you did those paintings, my compliments.
And I only think it's a pity that there are not more people like you.
And we only pray that he doesn't exist again.!
[Man on TV] Mrs. Irving now claims
Mr. Hughes himself asked Mrs. Irving... to deposit the money in a Swiss bank and then draw it out.
The manuscript itself, however... he maintains is genuine.
I've known Elmyr for about eight years.
We met when I was broke - when I was writing fiction and wasn't selling it very well.
[Welles]
His fiction didn't sell.
Elmyr's biographer is a highly gifted writer.
Does it say something for this age of ours...
- that he could only make it big by fakery?
- Je crois.
- That a hoax has made him the most famous writer in the world?
- La grande suprise.
[Welles] cliff Irving's caper may well be the hoax of the century... but really, this is not, you know, in any way, the century of the hoax.
We hanky-panky men have always been with you.
- That's a fact.
- [Welles] what's new are the-
- [Irving] the experts.
- [Welles] the experts.
- [Elmyr] the so-called experts.
- [Welles] experts are the new oracles.
- While greatly pretentious - they speak to us with the absolute authority of the computer.
Pretend to know something... what they only know very superficially.
And we bow down before them.
They're god's own gift to the faker.
All the world loves to see... the experts and the establishment made a fool of.
[Elmyr]
Let's say we could find... a Modigliani made by Kisling... a Modigliani by Elmyr... and one Modigliani by Modigliani.
It could be anyone from Knoedler to Paris or any of the great ones... who consider themselves great and experts.
If any of them recognize which one is which -
[welles]
And if the lawyers would just let us... we could name you one highly respected museum... which boasts of an important collection of postimpressionists... every single one of which was painted by Elmyr.
Elmyr, as the great faker of the 20th century... becomes a modern folk hero for the rest of us... who have a bit of larceny in ourselves... but simply don't have the courage or the opportunity to express it.
When you wrote his biography, you don't think you've been a little hard on him?
Some people even say, "after I did read the book of Clifford Irving about you...
I like you even more than before."
You exploded the myth of the infallibility... of the art dealers and museum directors... in that you exposed their crookedness... their evilness and viciousness.
I went around to the art galleries.
Not with my book... but with a catalog... which included a great many paintings... that had been sold over the past few years.
In this catalog was this Modigliani... which is a Modigliani by Elmyr.
He worked very little.
He died very early... so if they're added to a few paintings, a few drawings... it's not going to destroy his oeuvre.
I would say, "this is a fake"... and the art gallery owner would say, "well, yes, of course.
"I mean, you can see it's a fake, because Modigliani...
"would never have drawn the line of the arm...
"parallel to the line of the dress that way.
And the background is very badly done, and the signature isn't right."
In the next gallery, I would show them this Modigliani in the catalog and say...
- "that's a genuine Modigliani."
- [Elmyr] possibly, yes.
And they would look at it and say,
"yes, you can see it's one of his finest.
"It's a portrait of mademoiselle hébuterne," and "we know it very well," and "it's reproduced everywhere."
After that, I must say...
I lost my faith in the concept of expertise.
I don't feel bad for Modigliani.
I feel good for me.
[Welles] you name them.
He paints them.
He'll do you a dufy, a van dongen... a derain, a braque, a bonnard, a vlaminck.
- Would you like a nice Matisse?
- [Elmyr] many of these drawings... are very weak.
Matisse's lines were never that sure as mine.
He was hesitant when he made the drawing, you know?
He added to it a little more and a little more.
It wasn't as flowing, it wasn't as sure as mine.
I had to hesitate... to make it more Matisse-like.
Et voilà()()
I would like to see any expert... or any museum director, or any art dealer... who'd know which one is a Matisse... and which one is by Elmyr.
And I am ready to accept the challenge.
[Welles]
One nod from an expert... and that piece of canvas would be worth... maybe a couple of hundred thousand dollars.
And now, with your permission, a bit of verse... by Kipling.
"When first the flush of a newborn sun fell on the green and gold...
"our father, Adam, sat under the tree...
"and scratched with a stick in the mold.
"And the first rude sketch that the world had seen...
"was joy to his mighty heart.
"Till the devil...
"whispered behind the leaves...
"'it's pretty, but is it art?"'
It's pretty, but is it art?
Well, how is it valued?
The value depends on opinion.
Opinion depends on the experts.
A faker like Elmyr makes fools of the experts, so who's the expert?
- Who's the faker?
- [Elmyr] I know one thing.
I never offered a painting or a drawing... to a museum who didn't buy it.
They never refused one. Never.!
[Welles] what's he up to now?
This- this isn't a forgery.
No, not this time.
This is a portrait by Elmyr...
- Et voilà()()
- Of another famous art forger.
- Michel-ange.
- [Welles] Michelangelo, no less, signed-
[chuckles]
I must say I'm honored.
My signature, forged by Elmyr on a real Elmyr... is really something.
You know, art forgery used to be admired as an art.
And though Michelangelo even used smoke on some of his fakes to antique them... like some of the rest of us, he finally went straight.
[Elmyr]
Et voilà()()
[Welles]
Elmyr, reformed... and exposed- in the reverse order- was till just recently the island's number-one celebrity.
But now the crown has passed from the old emperor of the hoax... to the pretender.
Tomorrow at the party.
There's a big party.
- Don't miss it. Tomorrow at 8:00.
- [Woman] what time?
[Welles] the ex-grand master of fakery, not only unmasked, but eclipsed... by his own biographer... is putting a brave face on it...
- and giving another party.
- Eight o'clock.
[Woman]
At your house?
- [Welles] and here...
- I come to invite you for a big party.
[Welles]
Yet another painter from Ibiza.
Life hired him to illustrate the tale as Irving told it.
Nice to see you. Great.
Hello, David.
[Welles]
David Walsh.
And this is his impression, based on Irving's report... of that secret meeting on the Mexican pyramid with Howard Hughes.
Here's how he's supposed to have looked... based on Irving's reports of those secret meetings which in fact never happened.
But who cared about facts?
Was Mr. Hughes a vegetable?
A spook?
A gibbering lunatic?
Was his hair down to his knees?
Were his fingernails nine inches long?
Did Howard Hughes exist?
Irving insisted that he did.
Hughes denied the existence of Irving.
[Man on phone]
No, and I never saw him.
I never even heard of him.
[Welles] "don't believe a word of it," said Irving.
And believe it or not, almost nobody did.
Why, they were partners,
Hughes and Irving, said Irving.
They were doing a book together.
Now the Hughes mystery would be solved.
Now, of course Irving knew very well that whatever made Hughes a mystery... was whatever had made Hughes himself a born mystery maker.
Here in the smoggy wonderland of Hollywood is where I last had to talk to him.
It was 5:00 in the morning
25 years ago.
And I found him, as usual, very bright, and pleasant, and polite.
Well, now this is like most of the Hughes legends.
It's just something you hear, and nothing you can prove... but for what it's worth, it seems that hotel bungalow... was supposedly the H.Q. Of that rather spooky brigade of midnight minions... we used to call
"Howard's secret police."
That's where that tree comes in.
Just precisely there, at 1:30 every morning, for who knows how many years... some chosen operative placed, at precisely the same angle... a small and very carefully wrapped package.
Howard Hughes in his nocturnal wanderings never once paused there... but it was always ready for him in case he should.
What was it that that mystery package contained?
A ham sandwich.
[Clock ticking]
How can we believe that is true?
[Welles] François is referring, of course, to Elmyr.
But about Hughes... well, who could blame cliff Irving for believing... that Hughes himself wanted us to believe almost anything?
Look where we are now. When the old
Hollywood swinger turned hermit...
- this is the hermitage he picked-his hideaway...
- [roulette wheel spinning]
- His desert retreat.
- [Coins spilling from slot machine]
The desert had retreated first, of course... to make room for the slot machines and the crap tables.
Then came Hughes. He chased out or bought off most of the Mafia... bought up most of the hotels, and settled down up there... in a few rooms in the top floor of that one.
And all through the long years... not a shadow was seen moving in that window.
The good people of Las Vegas kept their eyes peeled, saw nothing... and believed everything they told each other.
More than one bemused observer... claims to have seen the whimsical tycoon... at 4:00 in the morning, promenading this highway... with no socks on... and wearing, instead of shoes... a pair of empty Kleenex boxes.
Do I believe that?
[Chuckling]
But people pretend to be shocked.
They like to be shocked, you know.
It's in their nature.
It's in human nature, you know.
What was he doing up there?
What were they doing to him?
If he broke his silence, would it be a... cry for help?
Well, if Hughes couldn't speak, or wouldn't... then somebody- and why not Clifford Irving- could do the speaking for him.
Nobody got near the man.
Just a tiny band of mystery Mormons... were admitted to his presence.
Even high executives in the Hughes empire... never so much as laid eyes on him.
One man alone laid claim to having made it into that fortress... and you can guess who that was.
How had Irving got to Hughes in the first place? "simple,"said Irving.
He'd just mailed him a copy of fake!
With a friendly, sincere dedication... and the partnership was formed.
And if you can believe the ham sandwich and the Kleenex boxes...
I guess you can swallow that.
[Man on telephone] I mean, this episode is just so fantastic... that it taxes your imagination... to believe that a thing like this could happen.
Was that the voice of the real Howard Hughes?
I only wish I was still in the movie business.
[Welles]
Well, now he's on television... and a committee of journalists are interviewing his voice.
[Man]
No, I don't remember any scripts... as wild or as stretching of the imagination... as this yarn has turned out to be.
Now remember how this went.
Irving announced that Hughes had decided... that Irving was just the writer he could trust... not only with his book, but with the money for it.
And this involved an advance of some three-quarters of a million dollars... and he had notes, memos and manuscripts in what he claimed... was Hughes's own handwriting to prove it.
Now they brought in the handwriting experts.
Now just here Irving should have been feeling a bit nervous.
Well, maybe he was just as cool as he acted... remembering what he'd learned from the old maestro himself.
Elmyr was a good teacher, if only by example... and his most valuable lesson was this:
Don't be spooked by the experts.
[Elmyr] my opinion about experts is that it's something far too overestimated.
It's a métier which shouldn't even exist.
And how right he was!
It should not exist that one single person makes a decision... about what's good or what's bad.
Sure enough, after much study and analysis... the experts on handwriting handed in their verdict.
The forgeries were genuine.
The proof, and I quote, was "irresistible... unanswerable, and overwhelming."
Thus Irving's papers, like Elmyr's paintings... were authenticated.
I wanted to find out what it was really like to try and get an expertise on a fake... and I asked Elmyr to do three drawings for me:
Two Matisse and a Modigliani - which he did before lunch... and put a little coffee stain on the edge of the Modigliani... to make it look really as if Modigliani had done it in some Paris café()()
- [Chuckling]
- I then took the three drawings to the museum of modern art.
The museum examined them for two hours... and came back with the verdict that they were absolutely genuine... and, in fact, were horrified that I wanted to sell them.
Besides, it's a true story.
The story's absolutely true.
Well, Mr. Irving pretends that he destroyed them.
I don't think that
Mr. Irving's character... is exactly a character who would destroy something... what he got an offer of 15,000.
I think it's a nice security in a bank vault... what could be unwrapped in 15 years again.
All the tales he tells now... are things that he has built up in his imagination over the years... and come to believe as true.
[Welles]
"The tale is as old as the Eden tree-
"and new as the new-cut tooth-
"for each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows... he is master of art and truth."
[Irving] this created in him,
I think, the ability to live-
I hesitate to say, a criminal life, because I don't think of him as a criminal.
- [Speaking french]
- He doesn't think of himself as a criminal.
To fool, once in a while, somebody very, very pompous...
- or somebody very-
- pretentious.
[Elmyr]
Pretentious, that, I like.
[Irving]
Now that it's out in the open... that the world knows who Elmyr is and what he's done... and now that Elmyr accepts it and says to the world...
"yes, it's me. I am the great art forger of the 20th century."
Now I think he can recapture that personal honesty.
- [Elmyr] good-bye, Matisse.
- I think Elmyr's problem for years... and the reason why he could not succeed as a painter in his own right... was that the type of life he led... prohibited him from having a personal vision.
[Welles] "and each man hears as the twilight nears...
"to the beat of his dying heart...
"the devil drum on the darkened pane:
"'It's pretty... but was it art?"'
[Crew member]
Art. Take two.
[Irving] and when an artist has no personal vision... what can he communicate onto the canvas?
[Speaking french]
- [Speaking french]
- Et voilà()()
It's pretty, but is it rare?
Lots of oysters, only a few pearls.
The chief cause and encouragement of fakery and phoniness in everything... even what we're given to eat- an awful lot of forgery is committed these days in the kitchen.
Oja?
[Sighs] the seafood isn't phony in here, thank god.
You can take the word of an expert.
Three friends from the old days who used to eat here were real painters:
Jean Cocteau, the poet and filmmaker- well, you might call him a Monday painter.
He drew the picture on the menu and signed his name, as you know... to a whole epoch.
Here on the walls are samples of the famous charm... of Christian Bernard-
"baby,"as we called him.
And speaking of charm, here's vertès all around us.
Vertès had to be charming.
He was Hungarian.
He started his career- and he told me this right here at this table-
"as a charlatan.
I painted fake masterpieces.
I began," he said, "as Lautrec."
[Elmyr]
A woman, a titled English woman... walked in one day to my room... and she saw on the wall - pinned on the wall, a drawing.
Say, "hey, where you got that Picasso?"
I say, "well, do you think it's a Picasso?"
"And there was this art dealer" -
I won't give you his name -
"turning down everything I showed him" - this is vertès speaking-
"when something caught his eye.
"'Where did you get that? ' he said.
"'That nice little Lautrec.'
"I told him it was a very nice little vertès.
"'I'll take the Lautrec, 'he said.
'And if you happen to find any more, bring them in."'
[Elmyr] she said, "would you sell it?"
I said, "well, delighted."
And I suddenly realize
I can sell something... absolutely unexpectedly for quite a great deal of money... in a time when I was unable, but absolutely unable... to sell any of my paintings.
"How could you blame me?
I had no money in my pocket... no socks in my shoes, no real painting style of my own."
[Elmyr] even the amount of five dollars meant that am I going to eat.
I don't meaning go home and be full, but to eat.
[Waiter speaking french]
I would like to see that poor Hungarian refugee... who would have resisted of that temptation.
[Welles]
Well, vertès didn't either.
Like all Hungarians, he told the best Hungarian jokes.
The omelet, you know that, don't you?
Sure. It's a classic.
An omelet, it's in our Hungarian cookbook.
"To make an omelet," it says...
"first, steal an egg."
[Elmyr] well, naturally, to be Hungarian is not a nationality.
It's a profession.
[Welles] but the truth about Hungarians, which they do try to cover up... is that they're not any more crooked than the rest of us.
But not the way they like to tell it.
Of all the Hungarian friends I've ever had...
I can't remember one who didn't want me to think of him... as a king of con men.
As for this Hungarian's own tales of his own lurid past... they don't, according to his biographer... jive exactly with versions of the same events... as told by certain art dealers.
I do think art dealers... are crooked.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
I put it to you that between such witnesses... your choice, to phrase it nicely, is not easy.
Even if Clifford Irving mentions in his book that -
I must insist that
I never sell to privates.
Some friend of mine say you should buy a fantastic drawing... that own a refugee of Budapest.
"Budapesht." it's not with a "pest."
It's with a "pesht."
He want to sell 10 Modigliani and 10, uh, Matisse.
At that time, when I sell to François... he was not a movie director.
He was an art dealer.
I tried to put it in art gallery.
Then it was an occasion...
- because they were to sell for $200.
- [Welles] "occasion"is a bargain.
[Laughing]
[Welles]
Our whole story really starts, you know... with two famous collections of paintings.
One belonged to the Reichenbach and was real... the other Elmyr was supposed to have smuggled out of Hungary.
- From his family.
- Oh, no, that's a complete fabrication.
I can tell you exactly who he was.
After the book was published
I got a letter from a man... who had known him in a concentration camp in Hungary.
And he said he was not from the aristocracy... but that he was from a normal lower middle-class home... and since then has refused to discuss it.
He just evades the subject whenever it's brought up.
It's terribly convenient, beside everything else!
[Welles] François bought some of Elmyr's paintings... and sold them again in his art gallery for a couple of fast bucks.
[François]
For double the price.
- [Welles] you sold them for double what you bought them for?
- Exactly.
Before he did pay me for the drawings he did buy... he sold it already before he paid me.
Then the third year,
I went back and - he came to see me.
He said, "I have other Modigliani."
- I was a little suspicious.
- [Welles] Elmyr said he has more.
- More, but you see, last time -
- and you thought maybe that's a little too many Modigliani.
Because the last time he say,
"it's my last one. Take it."
Then, when he had others...
I say, "where they come from?"
But I didn't try to investigate too much.
- But I kept -
- [welles] why didn't you?
- Like everyone.
- [Laughing]
Because they were very-
I didn't want to -
- you didn't want to know.!
- Not too much.
The year after, he call me.
He say, "I have three mores."
- Three more Modigliani.
- I say, "I have already 10 in my rooms.
"I'm not a collector of Modigliani.
"Of course, if you had a dessin- a portrait of soutine.
I love so much soutine."
- But why did you want a portrait of soutine?
- Because I like soutine.
- I see.
- And I asked to Elmyr if he had one.
He say, "I don't have any soutine by Modigliani. Why?"
[Welles]
Soutine was a friend of Modigliani.
- Exactement.
- You asked him if he had it.
He say, "I don't have it."
I say, "then keep your three others, even if they were very cheap."
They were the double price, but they were still very cheap.
Then the night, during the night, he call me.
He say, "François, you are a genius.
You guessed I had one."
[Laughing]
"How could you know?
I found one in my drawer.
A beautiful portrait of soutine by Modigliani."
[Elmyr] and now there's something else again what I'm doing here.
That is Picasso.
[Welles]
And now the scene changes... from new york to Pamplona.
This deep in the Hemingway country... you might not expect to find Elmyr.
And he said,
"I'm going to reimburse you."
- I said, "what are you" -
- reimburse you for what?
- For the fake I sold you.
- Yeah, but you made a lot of money on it.
- Yes, but he didn't know.
- [Chuckling] I see.
And you know what he did?
He gave me a check, and the check had no money in the bank.
- He gave you a false check.
- Yes.
- For a false painting.
- Yes.
[Welles]
There's a certain justice.
Well... good-bye, Picasso.
[Welles]
It's a fact of record that art dealers- would you take this away, please, and - and bring me the steak au poivre?
Thanks a lot.
That art dealers, either in ignorance... innocence, or simple greed... have made themselves fortunes on the paintings of Elmyr.
I have not the vaguest idea the money they got.
Those paintings must have been pretty good... or the dealers must have been... pretty bad.
I could not estimate if it was 10 million, 20 million - dollars, pounds, uh, zlotys.
A whole lot of them anyway made profits of a hundred percent and more on these affairs... and Elmyr himself has really made very little.
All I got was a little television of that size for the $250,000.
[Welles]
Even that handsome house of his, that isn't his.
A dealer has a deal with him.
Somebody must have made some kind of strange -
- [Irving] deal.
- Deal.
[Elmyr]
I was fooled.
I was used.
And I was squeezed out- squeezed out like the last drop.
Because even the roof of that house doesn't belong to me.
I don't have a dime to my name.
[Welles]
So after all these long years on the run... even now, after his final reformation as a forger...
Elmyr can't feel much real security in this last refuge... in what people like to call...
"the golden years."
- [François] a little bit of luck.
- And a dash of larceny.
[Welles] you've been freely owning up to your own past.
I'd better do some confessing myself.
François was an art dealer, and l- well, I was an artist.
I thought I was anyway.
Like Elmyr, I too was once a hungry painter.
But not here in France.
No, I was hungry in Ireland.
I'd come there to paint, bought a donkey and cart... filled the cart with paints and canvases and went traveling.
- At night I slept under the cart.
- [Bell tolling]
It was a very nice summer.
But then when I got to Dublin... the donkey had to go up for auction.
And so did I.
My paintings were gone... all given away to the Irish farmers who'd given me food.
I'd run out of paint and money.
I was 16 years old, and my career, as you might say... was at the crossroads.
Winter was coming in.
Oh, I guess I could have found myself an honest job... as a dishwasher or something, but, no, I took the easy way.
I went on the stage.
I'd never been on the stage, but I told them in Dublin...
I was a famous star from new york, and somehow got them to believe me.
That's how I started.
Began at the top, and have been working my way down ever since.
If acting is an art, cooking up that bogus Broadway career... was a fine case of art forgery.
And then later, on the radio - well, we've seen how Elmyr started.
In my past there aren't any Picasso.
No. My next flight into fakery was by flying saucer.
[Saucer whirring]
[Man on radio] we interrupt this program to bring you a news bulletin.
[Man #2 on radio]
High government sources have ceased to deny... the presence in many parts of the country of nonterrestrial objects.
[Man] we return you now to the starlight terrace of the hotel glory in scranton...
- to the singing strings of laszlo gabor and his melodeons.
- ## [Orchestral]
[Welles]
On the radio, I got my first job from Paul Stewart... and we were lucky enough to have him join us later in the mercury.
Paul was a real capo mafia in the martian caper.
"The war of the worlds" was before world war ii, remember.
Before television, in the great days of radio.
Maybe that's what made it all possible.
[Man on radio]
Another bulletin, ladies and gentlemen.
The latest word on the monsters from outer space.
[Man # 2] correction, from mars.
Sorry, folks, that's what experts are saying.
They are martians.
[Welles] TV would have shown us up.
Half the population... got the screaming jeebies just because they couldn't see... how silly it all would have looked.
[Stewart] we said that the martians were releasing a noxious gas... across the jersey meadows that was drifting towards new york.
So, people took to the hills.
[Welles]
I met a welfare worker years later... who told me he spent weeks trying to woo some of the refugees back to civilization.
[Man on radio] the entire state of new jersey has now been cordoned off.
State highways- uh, yes?
Ladies and gentlemen, a special news flash from Washington.
Any moment now, president Roosevelt will be receiving... a delegation from mars.
From mars.
Peace talks are expected-
[welles]
A woman-you just have to believe this- rushed into a police station out in San Francisco with her clothes in tatters... to report that she'd been repeatedly attacked by martians.
She tried to take poison for the shame of it... and they stopped her just in time.
Were they little green men, or what?
"I can't describe it,"she said. "it's hell."
Somebody down in south America... did an imitation of that broadcast... and he ended up in prison.
So I shouldn't complain, I guess.
I didn't go to jail.
I went to Hollywood.
And to testify to yet another coincidence, here's a leading film director.
All those years ago, he went west with the rest of us to make our first movie. Richard Wilson.
Our first movie?
Well, among the first of our projects was to be a story... based on the fictionalized life of a certain famous tycoon.
Joe Cotten was to have played the part.
That certain famous tycoon, yes.
But when the character was changed... to the famous newspaper tycoon, it became obvious... that Orson should play the part, which, of course, he did.
Oh, I'm not complaining.
No. I had a fine part in citizen Kane.
But I was just wondering.
That original concept may have been fun.
Yes, I was just wondering... if I would have been the first or the last... to impersonate...
Howard Hughes.
#[Fanfare]
[Announcer]
This week, as it must to all aviation's pioneers... the great heart of a welcoming nation went out... to handsome, well-heeled hero, Howard Hughes.
Broken for speed are all records for round-the-world solo flights.
Broken, too, is the garbage man's record for sheer tonnage in ticker tape.
Well noted by observers is the appropriate nature of ticker tape... as a tribute to the high-flying
Mr. Moneybags himself.
[Wilson]
Why did we change our minds?
Change tycoons?
Of course, we'd have to change his name.
And as a character in fiction... who could believe that a man like Howard Hughes could exist?
I put the sweat of my life into this thing.
I have my reputation rolled up in it.
[Announcer] Hughes fighting here for the future of a controversial airplane... an all-wood behemoth, the spruce goose.
Other inventions had more success.
One example, the brassiere.
Hughes's design for a Hughes-directed hit movie... was, for mammary America... the cause of a great uplift.
- Less uplifting was the spruce goose...
- [engine whirring, sputtering]
The biggest thing with wings that ever happened-
- [engine sputters, stops]
- In fact, it flew for a few minutes only, a few feet in the air.
And I have stated several times that if it's a failure...
I'll probably leave this country and never come back, and I mean it.
[Welles]
And that's what he did, finally.
The supersecretive celebrity... went all out for world fame... won it, and then got to be more famous trying for privacy.
Maybe he's a loser after all.
A lady from his past once told me that's part of his charm.
But this lady-killing, wheeling, dealing... death-defying, life-defying mystery man supreme... has a strange habit of winning somehow- sometimes anyway- just at the end.
Is he winning now, at the end of this story?
[Man on phone]
I only wish I was still in the movie business.
[Welles] our semimythological night bird of a billionaire... has flown his Vegas coop.
But only to go on mutely roosting... on the top of various other holiday hotels... in germfree... air-conditioned solitude.
Ah, it's his decision.
On this planet... crowded and computerized... being yourself- whatever that may be - and keeping yourself to yourself isn't easy.
Make what you want of Howard Hughes, but not a movie.
Cliff Irving had more courage than we did... and as sure a hand, certainly, at fiction.
Also, I'll admit that he's nudging the martians a bit... for the championship title.
[Man on phone] it taxes your imagination to believe that a thing like this could happen.
[Welles]
"I do not know Clifford Irving,"said the voice.
[Man] until a matter of days ago, when this thing first came to my attention.
[Welles] all over the world, people were saying that the fishiest thing in this whole business... was not Irving's part in it... but the identity of whoever it was who claimed to Irving he was Hughes.
And who do you think is still mixed up in all this?
According to one theory, who else but Elmyr, a man so skilled in art forgery... could have forged that manuscript?
Irving's lawyer is speculating about a host of theories.
Theories, if, for instance, that telephone voice... was Hughes and was telling the truth, we should remember... that Hughes had been known to make use of doubles.
And here comes another theory:
Now a double might be making use of Hughes.
According to informed sources, high officials in the Hughes empire... are not even now fully satisfied that the mystery is completely unraveled.
They are searching for a "Mr. Big" behind it all.
[Welles]
Was "Mr. Big" Mrs. Big?
- Edith, maybe?
- [Clock cuckoos]
Cliff Irving topped all this and stopped it dead... with a confession.
[Man] charges could result in as much as 100 years imprisonment.
But this may be softened if Clifford Irving... agrees to come clean on the whole story.
[Welles]
He did. He told it all... not only to the courts, but in a book.
And now, as Elmyr leaves that story... and a chapter in ours comes to a close... things may well be looking up just a bit... for his biographer, jail or not.
This is a headline in London's Sunday times:
"Hoaxer Irving makes a handsome profit."
- No, no, no.
- And for Elmyr, at least and at last... that story has a happy ending:
He's in the clear.
[Phone ringing]
[Welles] here's another coincidence for you.
To Connecticut, yeah.
[Welles] somebody else from Ibiza.
This is our coproducer.
- [Woman on phone] who's calling?
- Richard Drewett.
Richard Drewett, the only simon-pure noncharlatan in this movie.
Irving just now is holed up in Connecticut, and we're calling him from Paris.
And so excruciating is Richard's honesty, that he's insisted on warning... time magazine's nomination for con man of the year... that our call to him is being taped.
- Hello?
- The book.
Can you say anything about the, um - the deal that you've managed to do with the book?
I mean, is it- h-has it turned out as well as you'd expected?
- [Irving] th-the deal?
- [Drewett] are you going to tell the whole truth?
Yes. Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- In fact the title is the book about the book.
In two years, cliff, you are going to write
"the book about the book about the book."
[Welles] gentlemen, was that the real voice of Clifford Irving?
Well, Irving's real voice as a writer... he may well have found now in his new book.
The new title is what really happened.
[Elmyr]
I want to paint my own paintings.
I want the right uniquely... and exclusively of my work.
[Welles] and Elmyr?
Will there ever be another book about him?
He's told so many stories about himself...
- always telling this story to that one and another story to that one.
- Uh, I don't - he's lived always on the run.
[Elmyr] I, uh, stayed ultimately
12 years in the united states.
Which he spent there illegally, since he only had a three-month visa.
[Elmyr] I lived very simply.
I lived, uh, on my own paintings.
I sold them for $ 10, $ 15.
My own canvases. And then sometimes when I had absolutely no money...
I was completely broke,
I made a Modigliani drawing.
I took 'em to one of the big dealers around Beverly hills.
It never happened that I didn't sell them.
I always sold them.
One reason he was able to get away with what he was doing... for- for 22 years, selling fakes all over the world... all over the united states... was the existence of something new in the art world.
And that was the art market.
It enabled him to live from day to day... from painting to painting, from fake to fake... from- from con man to con man, from crook to crook... and from town to town.
Who knows? What is it?
What -what makes you travel?
You want a change of landscape.
You want to meet new people.
You want to meet new faces.
You think you'll meet somebody more attractive in the next town as you met there.
You never know. Why?
Why people travel. Do you know?
Because the FBI And the police in four different states were on his tail.
- But, uh -
- and he had to be one jump ahead of them.
He had to whip off to Mexico and then up to Canada, and then back to new york.
And then when he heard that the police were knocking on his door in Miami beach... he had to scuttle out of town on a greyhound bus to Texas.
[Man on radio] hit hard by torborg, but right to third baseman, aurelio rodriguez.
After one hop, the ball really flattened out for him.
[Welles]
Then, finally, on a distant island... he did find a home.
He doesn't own it, remember, but it's a splendid villa... with a fine view of the village... and the village jail.
To be in jail here is probably, I would say- here is better than somewhere else.
- But a jail is a jail. Let's face it.
- [Welles] moment of truth.
He's talking about the time they took him down... out of that villa, which he doesn't own, and put him into prison.
Let me show you that again.
To be in jail here is probably, I would say- here is better than somewhere else.
But a jail is a jail. Let's face it.
Hemingway wrote a great short story... about an old bullfighter called "the undefeated."
Well, all the heroes aren't in the bullring.
Here's our hero, our ex-jailbird... flying high above his troubles.
Watch the quick recovery.
[Elmyr]
That was quite a disgusting person.
He looks disgusting too, doesn't he?
He was, again, a German... whose main preoccupation was his mustache.
He kept doing nothing but touching his mustache.
He just kept on curling and curling and curling his mustache.
These other drawings are made during the time I was in prison.
In the very end, the judge himself thanked me... and he declared that
I'm a very generous and a very kind person.
Now that he's out of prison, what will he do?
He'll give a party. Another party.
[Speaking french]
[Man] Elmyr, how do you mean you were not in prison?
[Elmyr] because I wasn't a prisoner in the full sense of word.
I was not imprisoned. I was interned.
- [Woman speaking french]
- She's a great friend of mine.
She's a great friend of mine she was very sweet and kind to me.
When I was in prison, she came to see me every day.
Most of the days of the week.
Jean-Pierre Ramon.
I had a Spanish-polish prince...
Charles-touriski bourbon, who's a cousin germain... of the next king of Spain,
Juan Carlos, who came every day.
I had every day coming in Nina.
[Welles]
Nina, that morsel plucked... from our name-dropper's list of prison visitors... is the baroness van pallandt.
[Woman]
She was a witness against Irving.
It seems he couldn't have had a secret rendezvous with Howard Hughes in Mexico... because he spent every minute there with the baroness.
She used to be a famous folk singer, and now she's famous again.
Many other ladies flitted across the front pages.
No, our cameras never got close to them.
But Oja Kodar was something else.
- [Man] uh, miss Kodar-
- [woman] the newspapers have been calling you the Hungarian connection.
[Kodar]
Because of my connection with Irving?
[Welles]
This is from the tape of a recent interview.
- [Woman] there's quite a list.
- [Kodar] indeed.
- If only half of all that is true, I wonder how he ever got away to his typewriter.
- [Woman] well, miss Kodar.
- [Man] you wouldn't say that forgery's a crime?
- [Woman] and the experts?
[Kodar] as long as there are fakers,
I guess there'll have to be experts.
But if there weren't any experts... would there be any fakers?
[Welles]
A friend-another friend- once showed a Picasso to Picasso... who said, no, it was a fake.
The same friend brought him, from yet another source... another would-be Picasso, and Picasso said that, too, was a fake.
Then yet another from another source.
"Also fake,"said Picasso.
"But, Pablo,"said his friend...
"I watched you paint that with my own eyes."
[Chuckles] said Picasso,
"I can paint false Picassos as well as anybody."
I'm not excusing myself.
I'm not trying to make an excuse.
I'm trying to explain a psychological situation... and a human weakness.
[Irving] he's not in jail today for basically two reasons.
A court case would bring such publicity upon the art world... that any art dealer who took the stand would automatically become suspect.
The other reason he's not in jail is because... the french police have explained to me that in order to jail him in France... they would have to have two witnesses... who saw him doing the paintings... who saw him signing the paintings... as vlamincks or derains or Picassos.
[Elmyr] the signatures were put on... much later than the paintings were painted.
I never signed any painting anyway.
That's a very important matter.
[Clock ticking]
No, I never signed any of them.
No. Never did. No.
Never did.
Of course they were signed.
[Welles]
Well, whoever did sign them... his paintings are in so many great collections... that surely it must be said of Elmyr... that he has achieved a certain immortality... under various other signatures.
If you-you hang them in a museum or your collection of great paintings... and if they hang long enough there, they become real.
[Welles]
Now, this has been standing here for centuries.
The premiere work of man, perhaps, in the whole western world.
And it's without a signature.
Chartres.
A celebration to god's glory and to the dignity of man.
Well, all that's left, most artists seem to feel these days... is man.
Naked.
Poor, forked radish.
There aren't any celebrations.
Ours, the scientists keep telling us... is a universe which is disposable.
You know, it might be just this one anonymous glory... of all things- this rich stone forest... this epic chant, this gaiety... this grand choiring shout of affirmation... which we choose... when all our cities are dust... to stand intact... to mark where we have been... to testify to what we had it in us... to accomplish.
Our works in stone, in paint, in print are spared- some of them for a few decades, or a millennium or two- but everything must finally fall in war... or wear away into the ultimate and universal ash.
The triumphs and the frauds... the treasures and the fakes.
A fact of life.
We're going to die.
"Be of good heart"... cry the dead artists out of the living past.
"Our songs...
"will all be silenced.
"But what of it?
Go on singing."
Maybe a man's name... doesn't matter... all that much.
[Welles]
And now, at last, we come to Oja.
[Woman on p.a. Speaking french]
[Welles] for this true story, and with her kind collaboration... we offer now- well, you might call it a reenactment of recent history.
As we told you at the start, she comes into this only at the end.
And that's where we've left her, for the end.
And as for coincidence-
[scoffs]just for instance,
I give you Oja's grandfather.
Oh, no.
[Chuckles]
No, let's take him back for a while and save him for later.
The mixture's rich enough as it is.
Oja, as far as I know... never breathed a word about him to any of us.
She comes into this when she herself came to the attention of- well, who else, but the first genius among all the artists of our age.
The most celebrated, certainly the wealthiest painter... in 6,000 years.
Well, Picasso is the biggest phenomenon of our time.
It never existed that a painter was able... with one movement of his hand - what necessarily didn't involve more than 10 seconds - that movement of the hand... transformed in gold.
Not even john d. Rockefeller was able to do that.
- [Bells chiming]
- [Woman on p.a. Speaking french]
[Chuckling]
His estate has been valued at...
$ 750 million.
[Chuckles]
Oja turned him into a girl watcher.
This happened not so very long ago... when Picasso, for reasons of his own... went to paint for a while in the little village of toussaint.
Oja was there too, on her holidays.
And she had a friend with her, a boy named Olaf... from somewhere in the Viking country.
## [Jazz]
In his homeland, up there in the frozen north...
Olaf had been infected rather imperfectly... with a taste for the classic jazz of new Orleans... and his researches in this area took place under Picasso's window... where morning and night he practiced the trombone.
#[Continues]
Olaf's trombone commenced early... finished late... and nearly drove Picasso out of his skull.
And then - then there was another distraction.
Far more disturbing.
Oja.
Oja in the morning, on her way to the beach.
Oja at 10:00, coming back for the suntan lotion.
To the beach again... and back once more at noon for lunch.
In that climate, after lunch one takes a siesta.
Not Oja.
And not Picasso either.
Cocktail time.
Dinnertime.
Anytime.
Oja on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday... and all through the week.
Week after week.
Oja checking on the trombone.
Oja escaping from it.
But no escaping for Picasso.
Was he tempted?
Perhaps he was... inspired.
[Wings flapping]
[High heels tapping]
[Trombone blows]
I can't tell you what happened in there.
But Picasso was a fast worker, by which -
I mean to say, you understand, that... the results of this encounter were, to say the least of it... extremely fruitful.
Figs sweetened on the trees.
Grapes burst into ripeness on the vines.
And 22-22- large portraits of miss Oja Kodar... were born under that virile brush.
Money. We've heard Elmyr on that subject.
Well, Picasso didn't make all that bread... by casting any crumbs of it on the waters, or feeding it to the birds... or giving away any pictures to his models.
But Oja laid down conditions.
She put a price... on the sunshine.
To give it up, he had to give something to her.
And this is true, you know.
What she exacted from Picasso was no less than this:
All those pictures - all 22 of them - were to be hers, outright.
Her property. Oja's very own to pick up and carry away... which is just exactly what she did with them.
The lot. Let's call it the loot.
She got away with it all.
Well, no wonder she's rich, you'll say.
- But wait, there's more to this.
- [Bells chiming]
Just now, Paris is fogbound.
Just then - and this is important to our story- there was another sort of paralysis.
Uh, Paris was suffering from august.
[Chuckles]
This happens every year.
It shuts down, closes up... and this is the time when an invader could take the country by telephone... if he could get somebody to answer it.
And this is the time, of all time... when, down there in toussaint...
Picasso, opening his morning newspaper... read that in a little-known art gallery in Paris... there had been opened to the public an exposition... of the works of Pablo Picasso.!
- [Thunderclap]
- At this, a species of atomic blast... stormed out of the riviera.!
In the American hemisphere... we give our bigger tornadoes... names like Ethel, Mary Lou and Dolores.
Well, what shook the south of France that day... should've been called "Pablo."
Booking a seat on the first available plane... the storm now moved toward Paris.
And there wasn't any improvement in the atmospheric conditions... at the airport when another newspaper came to the artist's furious attention.
"Picasso,"said the headline...
"has been born again."
Critics were hailing the freshness, the force, the fecundity.
But who cared? Not Picasso.
No. There'd been a very clear understanding.
None of those portraits were ever to be sold.
Oja'd get rich, but not a penny's profit for Pablo.
There are witnesses who swear that an aureole of blue flame... sizzled about that noble head... as the great painter burst into the picture gallery.
What is remembered - what will never be forgotten - is the terrible incandescence... of Picasso's rage.
And then there came a sudden... and quite remarkable change.
Those famous staring eyes... now stared as eyes have never stared before.
From picture to picture they traveled.
All 22 of them... recognizing... none.
Not one single canvas... in that whole collection... had been painted by Picasso.
And there she was... standing beside him.
You told him about your... grandfather... that he was dying.
- He didn't even know he existed.
- Nobody did.
The greatest of all the art forgers... remained always a legend, mentioned only in whispers.
Oja, tell us what you did with Picasso.
I just took him by the hand and led him out... and put him in my little car.
And drove him to your grandfather's secret studio?
This is true, you know.
What's amazing is that he went with her.
Here are some pictures.
These are the last I took of him.
And the first to be made public, hmm?
[Oja] he was never photographed, except in the family.
- He was very careful about that.
- [Welles] that's why he was never caught.
You know, I never thought to ask Elmyr about him.
After all, they're both Hungarians.
There are many great painters in the renaissance, but only one da vinci.
The point being, that among great art forgers... your grandfather is the da vinci?
One of his da vinci's is so famous
I don't dare to name it.
Giving him credit is as tough as nailing him for the crime.
- Crime?
- [Chuckling] well... he painted every last one of those phony Picassos of you.
For every last one of which
Picasso was very highly praised.
But not, to put it mildly, highly pleased. You must have known you couldn't get away with it.
I got to meet Picasso.
So, here they are, the world's best and least known geniuses.
My grandfather was very glad to see him.
[Welles sighs]
"Picasso"... said her grandfather...
"I've been painting you for years.
All the great Picasso periods."
I'm not trying too hard for the Hungarian accent...
- but I think that's how it went.
- Oh, yes.
"This girl," said Picasso,
"claims that you're dying."
"A dying art forger," he said,
"is still an art forger."
Well, you tell us what Picasso said.
He called us both a couple of crooks.
"Oja,"said your grandfather,
"is quite as honest...
"as anyone that young, that beautiful... and that Hungarian has any need to be."
"She's stolen my pictures," said Picasso.
"She made you a gift, señor.
She gave you a whole summer."
"It's not more than the price of 22 Picassos.
And where, for god's sake, are they now?"
"Pablo -
"may I call you Pablo?
"No.
"Well, señor...
"it seems that in my son-in-law's new little art gallery...
"there are 22 paintings, every one of which has been acclaimed...
"as a masterpiece.
At least, that's the best critical opinion."
"The best critical opinion is a load of horse manure."
Or words to that effect.
"How perfectly we agree on that, señor.
"But you have so little reason to be bitter.
"Is there a man in all the world who doesn't know your name?
And who in all the world knows mine?"
"You're one of those that use so many names that you forget your own!"
"I, señor, am not one...
"of anything.
"Like you, I am unique.
"You've seen my big Cézanne at the metropolitan?
"Is that just a forgery, my friend?
Is it not also a painting?"
Now, you tell us what Picasso had to say to that.
Something dirty in Spanish, I think.
He did accuse your grandfather of arrogance.
Arrogance? A man who never in his life signed his own name to a picture.
What could be more modest than that?
"It's true that when you think of those great Rembrandt" -
- Chicago has five of them. Important ones.
- "And London.
"Why, just those two small tintorettos in brazil.
- "And Tokyo.
- The big one.
In Cincinnati. Did all the Goyas and most of the Grecos."
And the Monet.
And the Manet in Detroit.
"So, am I not then myself"... said your grandfather,
"one of the great painters?
"No? No.
"Yet here you are, Picasso, standing at the deathbed of a ghost.
"For all my life I've been a ghost.
"And for all time, the galleries and museums will be haunted with my works.
"Do you think I should confess?
To what?
"Committing masterpieces?
"They'd all be torn down from the walls.
And what then would be left of me?
"But before I die,
I find I need something.
"To believe -
"I must believe...
"that art itself...
"is real.
If it is not, señor" - here, my grandfather was interrupted by Picasso... who asked him to stop making speeches.
"We've only to settle the fate...
"of 22 large canvases...
"painted by me.
"Picasso, you move so easily...
"from one Picasso period to another...
"change like a-an actor...
"like an art forger yourself.
"Won't you give to me, who admire you so much...
"a happy death?
"Can you not let me go knowing that at last...
"I've managed to give something new...
"to the world?
"One whole Picasso period.
Would you give me this?"
"Give me my pictures," said Picasso.
"Give me back my 22 paintings."
"Ah,"said your grandfather.
"That is impossible.
I have burnt them."
- [Elmyr] well, good-bye, Picasso.
- [Bells chiming]
Time for a confession?
- Time to go.
- Good night, Oja.
That's her real name, you know.
Oja. Oja Kodar.
I don't think that young gentleman's a trombone player... but Oja's grandfather was Hungarian.
- Did he paint any pictures?
- Never in his life.
[Welles] ladies and gentlemen, we did use Oja's grandfather... to lend verisimilitude to the reenactment of this story.
But is "reenactment" really the word?
What I mean is, with a story this hard to believe... reenactment isn't easy.
[Chuckling]
- Right, François?
- Right.
At the very beginning, I - of all this -
I did make you a promise.
Remember? I did promise... that for one hour
I'd tell you only the truth.
That hour, ladies and gentlemen, is over.
For the past 17 minutes,
I've been lying my head off.
[Welles] the truth- and please forgive us for it- is that we've been forging an art story.
As a charlatan, of course, my job was to try to make it real... not that reality has anything to do with it.
Reality? It's the toothbrush... waiting at home for you in its glass.
A bus ticket, a paycheck... and the grave.
In the right mood, perhaps,
Elmyr has just as few regrets... as I have to have been a charlatan.
But we're not so proud, either of us... as to lay any superior claim... to being very much worse than the rest of you.
No, what we professional liars hope to serve is truth.
I'm afraid the pompous word for that is "art."
Picasso himself said it.
"Art, "he said, "is a lie-
"a lie that makes us... realize the truth."
Oja's grandfather, floating here in the air... has no comment, which isn't surprising... because he never existed.
To the memory of that great man who will never cease to exist...
I offer my apologies... and wish you all... true and false... a very pleasant good evening.
[Clicks]
Teddy bears, they're not real.
He is a Polar, look at his claws.
This was no ordinary outing to the zoo.
It was a very special occasion.
This was part of the program filmed in 1964... when we brought together a group of seven year old children... from vastly different backgrounds.
We went to prep schools, primary schools, state schools and private schools... and picked out fourteen children.
We brought them together because... we wanted a glimpse of the shop stewards and the executives of the year 2000.
Give me a child until he is seven... and I will give you the man.
These children are now fourteen, half way between childhood and manhood.
This is our interim report.
If we did all love Jeffrey we all want to marry.
-Yeah.
I think I know the one that he'd like best and that's her.
Jackie, Lindsay, Suzan.
Plenty of boy friends, but not one.
-Several ones.
Not one particularly. We're friends with plenty of boys you know.
My heart's desire is to see my daddy who is six thousand miles away.
Bruce.
No, I'm having...
I'm getting along well.
With my step father.
And I like to see my father occasionally.
And he does come over from Rhodesia
Do you have any girl friend?
Nicolas from Yorkshire Dale.
I don't want to answer that.
I don't want to answer those kinds of questions.
No I'm not answering that one
Suzie.
I gave that up as a failure.
I was gonna be a policeman but I thought how hard it would be to join in.
Paul.
Baseball appeals to me most but in the school...
I'm one of the best players in form two
But when I got into the team... they make me look like I can't play.
I feel like joining in when there's already a fight.
I was going to be a film star.
Simon.
Now I'm going to be an electrical engineer.
It's more to reality.
Singing Waltzing Matilda in Latin in an exclusive pre-prep school in Kensington, we chose three boys.
Charles,
Andrew.
I read the Financial Times. and John.
I read Observer and The Times.
What do you like about it?
Well, I like...
I usually look at the headlines then read... about them... about it.
I like my newspaper because I got shares in it written and...
I know everyday what shares are
-The stuff misers like you like
No. But... on Mondays they don't move up so I don't look at it.
I made several blunders on Seven Up.
For instance, I said I was going to
Trinity Hall instead of Trinity College.
They didn't like that too much, nor did my father.
Also I rather exaggerated when I said that how much I like stocks and shares because I don't any more.
How do you think you've changed since you were seven?
What I mean... one grows so slowly that one never notices
I feel the same the way I felt at seven I may not be the same.
When I leave the school, I'm going to College Court... and then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam.
John passed the entrance exam and is a weekly boarder at Westminster School.
When I leave school, I'm going to the Dragon School, I might. and mummy is... then I go to...after I might go to Charterhouse, Marlborough
Charles is at Marlborough
When I leave the school, I go to Broadstairs, St. Peter's Court.
And after that I'm going to Charterhouse.
Andrews is at Charterhouse.
When I leave the school, I'm down for Heathfield in Southover Manor
Suzie is at Southover Manor
Would everybody please sit round now?
One third of our children... their education was pre-planned and paid for.
The remaining went to State schools and their future seemed less certain.
I want to be a jockey when I grow up.
Ya, I want to be a jockey when I grow up.
Tony is on the way to achieving his ambition.
He spends all his free time at Tommy
Gosling Racing Stable at Epsom.
My dad put me onto Mr. Gosling
Mr. Gosling tells me that I've to come here on every school holidays. and learn a bit more.
Next year I'll be leaving school and work here for good.
Did your parents encourage you to do this?
Ya they're pleased... knowing what I'm gonna do.
They always have wanted me to be a Jockey.
Why?
Enjoyment. To say, `my son is a Jockey', you know what I mean!
Tony's change from Elementary school to
Secondary  didn't alter his ambition.
But how about the other children?
Has the change of school, changed them?
Bruce was at the pre-preparatory boarding school in Surrey.
And that's Farmer.
He gives me nightmares.
I was about five when
I went there and then...
I suppose, I was too young really to understand it and...
I thought it was a bit severe at that time then I just got used to it.
And didn't have sort of any impulses to do things wrong or
Then I think that I just got into the track of... you know... what they said you must do and you mustn't. at St Pauls I like the companionship you know... with other boys... really. and you get that much more in a boarding school.
Well I think boarding makes you feel self-sufficient.
And also teaches you to be away from your parents... and to live with people for a long time... which you've to do in later life any way.
I don't agree with that
...a certain amount when you board on the weekly bases, you've the best of best worlds
One sees one's parents at the weekend... and one gets all the benefits from a English Boarding School.
I think prep school boarding is a bad idea. -Yes.
Because  I'm... up till about twelve, may be its different with other people...
I found that... you are much more attached to your parents.
Once you come to about thirteen-fourteen, you're not quite so attached to them.
Two of our boys who didn't have the chance to be attached to their parents were those brought up in the children's home... supported by charity.
Simon.
I had one dream when... everything flew up in the air... and that all landed on my head.
Simon stayed there till last Christmas, when he returned to live with his mother. they say where's your father then... you know... when your mom's out at work... where's your father,
I just tell them I haven't got one
What effect does that have on you?
Well... I don't think it's had any effect on me because... what you don't have you don't miss as far as I can see
Also at the children's home with Simon was Paul.
He and his family immigrated when he was eight.
I don't like big boys hitting us the staff up in the washroom sends the nurse out, well there's no talking
I wasn't talking today and...
Brown sent me out for nothing.
What do you remember of England?
It seemed to be raining all the time.
I wouldn't stake my life on it
I can't remember very much!
He went to Australia to start a new life.
Well, I was going to become a bank accountant but its more book taking... than maths and that's the main reason...
I was thinking about becoming a panel beater
And...
I don't know why.. I stopped thinking about that.
I just hadn't made up my mind yet
I was gonna be a gym teacher but... one of the teachers told me that...
I had to get up on to the University.
Were you happy at the
Children's Home in England?
I didn't mind that really because
I didn't know what was going on.
I was a bit young
You were happier than you are now?
In a way... yes, I was.
But then I'm happy for being home.
At the school everything you wanted you just had.
You know, everybody was your friend.
And you never knew any enemies, really.
But here... people are undecided about you.
They can be friend one day and not the next.
Then I moved to Comprehensive School.
I found it much bigger, of course and...
I found it hard to settle in to it first.
From the Liverpool suburb returning home from the School, Neil and Peter.
I'm much more happy now than when I first came... we have different types of people.
People have different sorts of brains from ways of very clever people, you know... to people haven't much sense at all really.
Well... we pretend we've got swords... and then we make the noises of the sword-fighting... and then once we get stabbed we'll go...
'aaaaaahh'!
I've been playing since I started at the
Comprehensive School in the first year.
We play international wrestling.
Ya, that's right. That's summer time though.
Yes, and we can go on the grass. there used to be a senior team...but they lost interest.
Watch this.
Check, mate.
- O...k.
Gosh it is, how did you do that?
This is a very good idea to have competition... other wise we start to relax really and not so try hard enough.
What do you think?
I could say, yes.
It's a good thing.
For if no one competes with you, you won't be trying it this hard.
The three little girls from East End... had a choice of going to a Comprehensive or a Grammar School.
I am going to work in woolworths
Lindsay chose the Grammar School.
Why am I using a wooden spoon please? to stir this saucepan?
The noise.
The noise, yes. we got
16 people. 16 sauce pans.
We don't want noise from 16 people stirring with metal spoons.
This is my first choice and this is where I turned up... even though... my friends were going to the other school.
I just didn't feel like going to the Grammar School, I just...
Comprehensive School, it just seemed more friendly, you know yes.. and at that time but now...
It's different.
-Grammar School is fantastic.
If you say so.
- we've all got our opinions.
What advantages has a
Comprehensive School got?
Especially this school, it’s new they've got everything you could want equipment and...
What I enjoy in this school is... in this school we do metal work and wood work
The boys do cookery. we get a share of everything, sort of thing...
It's though, metal work and that
In the Grammar School, I don't think you find many girls want to do wood work
That's the difference.
-That's a different school. that shows the difference in the people.
One of the keys to the character of the 7 year old was how they spent their free time
Bruce had a school band.
When I go home, I come...
I come in and mummy gives me a cup of tea... and then I go out and play.
And when it starts to get dark...
I come in again and put on T.V. last night i didn't go to bed until seven.
I usually go to bed at ten o'clock or eleven o'clock. sometimes i go to the dog racing. i like... going there for something to do at night
So I don't really do anything at night.
Only go to the dogs or other things other things... watch Telly.
I don't watch very much television.
I used to watch a lot but
I'm not watching it so much.
And I think its good because lot of it is corrupting me a bit.
I like soap operas, i always watch them with my parents
For one thing, the advertisements you know...
I can recite about six tunes off and it just seems a worthless thing to know
There’re too many things going on at school... though we do have a television and... at the weekend I can be more selective and there's not much that I like
Well, I am quite interested in Archeology.
And we are doing a local dig in Binscombe near our school. being in set one is very very hard to keep up with the leaders
And I've no time to relax at all.
What do you do then in the evening?
I go out with friends normally.
-Yes.
Or to clubs sometimes.
-Yes.
There aint many clubs round here. It's disgusting.
It really is.
You hear people're talking about it on television... but it's really bad here in the Eastend
There's hardly anything.
There's always something to do here
I'm never ever bored.
Suzie now lives in Scotland on her father's 4000 acres estate. its very very small really we've only got one phone
There is my zone. it's so small there's a kitchen and dining room... a drawing room... and a room we mostly sit and let people in. that's really it!
What sort of things do you do?
Write, swim, play tennis. ping-pong, might play croquet, things like that.
What about social life? What's that?
In Perthshire?
-Yes.
It's quite fun
There's lots of things going on.
Your dog's got a rabbit.
What are you gonna do? do you want to save it.
Max, bring it here.
It's disgusting dog!
This is a second one you have given me in a second week.
For God's sake leave it alone.
Does that worry you?
Nope. Not at all.
I see this birds been wounded. I don't like that.
They run off and you never get a chance to kill them.
Why does it worry you if things should have to be killed?
Because I've been brought up with it
That mustn't be delayed there.
Quiet quietly! Its a very nonchalant little theme. butter wouldn't melt in its mouth
Take it very quietly and let it just present itself
We have... about ten pianos with practise rooms and
Orchestras Choral Societies and 2 choirs
It's a marvelous music system. there is too much competition now a days
And there are so many good pianists... and only a very few make the grade one... and I think its very disparaging if you can get it only half way.
Are you ambitious?
Yes.
What for?
Well... for fame... and power.
What sort of power?
Political power.
Are you ruthless?
Not really.
You think you can have political power without being ruthless?
Yes.
Then what qualities do you need to have political power if not ruthlessness?
Great strength of mind.
They'd like to come out for a holiday... in the country when we like... when I like the holiday in the town.
No, I 've been to Leeds a couple of times and...
I haven't been to Manchester.
And...
I went to London with the others when you did the first program with us.
That's the only time I've been.
Nicholas won a scholarship to Yorkshire Boarding School.
In this village there's me and then the next oldest is Andrew there. i'm not unhappy... living on the farm and going to the school and boarding there.
All right, it would be better than living on the farm all the time.
I won't like to live in the school all the time either.
You want to take up farming?
-No.
I'm not interested in it.
I was interested in Physics and
Chemistry but I'm not going to do that here.
When I grow up I like to find out all about the moon and all that.
Did your father want to be a farmer?
I don't think he really wanted to be... but he got stuck with it. because my grand father, he certainly probably wanted him to be a farmer.
But I don't think my father wants me to be a farmer.
And... my youngest brother is deaf. if he can't do anything else he can run a farm but as a last last resort.
Not till these holidays have I been out of Europe.
These holidays I went to America, stayed with somebody from the school.
Have you been abroad?
Austria.
What was it like?
Not bad!
Would you like to travel?
No.
Well, I ski in Switzerland and
I enjoy that immensely and then... we went to France this time and...
I lived in Rhodesia.
I enjoyed Switzerland most I think
I think it's a beautiful country.
I went to very interesting places.
I also enjoyed Austria but not to such a great extent.
Well, I've never been abroad.
-Nah... neither did I.
I've, you know.
-Oh yeah, because you went on that cruise.
I've been to Spain and...
Gibralter and... Casablanca. yeah
- Oh you loved it
That was interesting though!
Traveling doesn’t really interest me a lot.
Happy where I'm.
I've been to so many places.
Sicily, Italy, France and Spain and Switzerland... many times.
Have you traveled much?
When I was at the School, we used to go... to... have outings.
We used to go to Boxhill and places....
And we used to go to mystery tours. and... travel in country.
We went to History Museums for outings and...
Geographical Museum and...
Science Museum.
I've been to Madame
Tussauds with my mom.
And the...
Planetarium Museum.
Do you want to go abroad?
Ya...
Ya, I would like to go to Majorca take a couple of weeks out there from everything sort of relax myself
No but I said that when boys go around with girls... they don't pay attention to what they're doing.
My Grand mother had an accident because a boy friend was kissing... his girl friend in the street.
The girls never do what the boys want
They always start playing with dolls... when the boys want to play rough and tumble.
It's quite true!
Beginning to become more important.
-Ya!
In what way?
Well, they're no longer just bores.
"We won't play this" or some thing. well, its half of the community and they're there.
And you can begin to talk to them.
I think they're still bores for the most part
When I get married I will like to have two children.
You want a Nanny to look after them or you ?
No, I want Nanny to look after them.
Do you have any boy friend Suzie?
Well, my girl friend... is in Africa and I don't think I have another chance of seeing her again
And there're two in Switzerland which
I liked too in a hotel.
Do you have any girl friend?
No... not yet!
I'm sure it will come but not yet!
Say... you had a wife...
Say... say you have to eat what they cook you... and say I don't like greens well I don't... and say... she says you have to eat... what you're given... so...
I don't like greens so if she gives me greens then that's it
I prefer to be alone really
I wouldn't mind living with my brother you know... but otherwise I prefer to live alone.
Sometime on Saturday mornings
I go to the cinema
Sometime with my friends and sometimes with him.
You don't!
-I do!
She don't. I don't always see you you go to different cinema
Have you got a girl friend?
-No.
Would you like to have a girl friend?
No.
I thought that one would come up because when I was... when I was doing the other film said `what do you think about girls?' and I had said that I don't answer questions like that is that the reason you're asking it? yeah i thought so
What do you want me to say?
I don't know what to say.
Once... Caroline Tetford said she was good, she loved me.
What happened after that?
And I am going to marry her when I grow up.
I hate her. She's always cursing bad temper and cross with me.
Is she?
Yes! Neil Hughes! Move your desk forward. perhaps I'm not mature enough yet to be interested.
See, he loves Suzan because Suzan loves him.
He loves Lindsay and Lindsay loves him.
-I doubt it!
Have you got any boy friends? oh... that's personal isn't it! i don't like the way you came out with that
We shouldn't tell him... shall we?
What do you think about making this program?
I think this is ridiculous.
There's no point in doing it.
Why not?
What's the point people going into peoples lives and saying. why do you like this, why don't you like this. i see no point in it.
What's the point of the program? if the point is to reach a comparison.
I don't think it is!
Because we're not necessarily typical examples.
And I think that's what people seeing the program might think.
Yes
-Falsely.
And they would intend to type-cast us.
So everything we say, they will think, Oh! that's a typical result... of the public school system.
-Ya!
Well, in what way aren't you typical?
Well, I'm bit more reactionary than most.
I don't know. None of the parties really seems to agree with me.
I think if I had voted, I had voted Labour.
I would've voted Conservatives.
I don't think I would vote for any of them.
Conservatives.
The Conservatives would do the best for the country.
I think they're all as bad as each other really
Labour.
I don't really know.
I know what i wouldn't vote though what way?
Labour.
Conservatives.
Why?
-Why?
I don't know i don't know
I really don't know much about politics and it doesn't interest me, so
I don't really bother.
I didn't agree with the conservatives, what they're doing with the Black people
You know...the racial policy
Jacqueline, what do you think about colour people?
You said to me once you like them but what do you really think about them?
Well, they're nice and its as same as us really.
But one thing... it's only because their skin is brown and we're white, sort of pinkish we're...
Do you think of a purple person... with red eyes, yellow feet and...
I can't really think of what they really look like.
They are just the same as me, isn't it?
I don't... anybody who is coloured.
I don't want to know anybody who is coloured. Thank you very much!
I'm not against coloured people... but I wouldn't worry if I didn't know one until the day I died.
People have got to get used to knowing coloured people.
And coloured people in turn have got to get used to being with white people... because... if either side doesn't work proparly, then no side work properly.
People just got to mix in with every body else.
I do think it's wrong but in a country... like England... there should be places where the... there are more coloured people than the white people.
Good old Enoch Powell personally I've nothing against coloured people.
I think they're same as every body else.
But it seems that they...there's lot of argument about them because... as any foreigner really... they're taking up people's jobs in England.
I don't care what colour sombody is. unless they're blue that would be pretty peculiar.
But... might find somebody yet
You know, I don't care about colour.
Well, I think both Black and Whites are equal.
As long as they are there, they as well educated each other
What do you feel about racial discrimination? strong avow
Why?
Because so is any kind of discrimination
Of a basic nature that you can't change,
I mean I couldn't care less if people discriminated against because they are... nasty or selfish or any thing but...
I mean one can't help one's colour.
So
Now that you are interested in politics would like to be a politician what kind of things would you change?
I won't allow any strikes!
How would you do that?
I would set about a Tribunal... where people... workers could apply for... better wages and... this Tribunal would have the final word and... if it says `no wage rise', no wage rise.
It’s a big problem because of the discussion i think
The workers do tend to take fewer liberties as regards strikes.
Who do you think to blame for strikes?
The workers or the management?
The manager probably… say the workers and we will probably get a load of letters or something like that
It seems to me iniquitous that people should be paid... when they don't do any work.
Which is what unions do do
I'm not commenting because mom has been out on strike.
Ya… so is mine!
Very irresponsible because we all want more money as much money as we can get.
And what will happen if we all stopped working just because we want more money?
I want money. Why shouldn’t
I strike for it? I am sure anyone.
If you want more money, you will strike for it.
That’s right! Ya! That’s right!
They're going to strike for it, they're going to get more money. the school meals are going up so they're going to strike, they want more money
It's going to keep on going going going you know...
Truly by crushing... strikes.
Then in a way that’s defeating… a small part democracy.
It's not because they'd still have their...
They'll still be able to ask for more money.
But they wouldn't be able to strike for it which I mean... it's so damaging
It's still depriving them their freedom to strike. so is putting people in prison depriving them their freedom to go on killing people and stealing from people
Who is going to do this, they're not going to be voted in the parliament.
So its not worth it.
You can always decide a new policy once you are in.
What do they think about each other?
And how'll they act together?
To find out, we invited them all to one big party... and joined in.
Yes, they were bit too tough for my liking.
Somebody hit me right in the back and I 've still got some pain there.
The posh ones O! Yes. O! yes. O! Yes.
They're nuts! you just have to touch them
And some of them were rather dirty. what did you think about them?
-I played with them quiet naturally.
I think they were rather nice, really.
What do you think about rich people?
Well... not much.
-Tell me about it.
They think they can do everything without you doing it as well... they think just because they're rich... they have to have people that have to do all their work and stuff.
What would you do if you have lots of money, about say... two pounds?
I would help the poor.
Ya because the poor if you don't, they all would die.
Wouldn't they?
And everytime we've a harvest festival, we send them food.
Once these two went round giving food out with Mr. Floyd.
I don't think much of the accents.
Neither do I.
-Neither do I.
That doesn't prevent me liking them.
Rich children always make fun of poor children.
Yes. -Yes they say, O! look at that lovely little sissy over there
Yes, and they throw things at them.
Yes.
And poor child gets scared to death.
Do you meet here many boys from very different social backgrounds?
Not really.
Do you find that a lack in your life?
No.
Why?
I don't feel any lack any where.
Do you feel you should be meeting broader persons from the different back grounds?
Not really.
You don’t think you are missing?
No.
I don't see what background's got to do with it
They are people from so many...
I think it's the interest that makes it worth there's people with so many... varied interests in the school,
I can't imagine of any more.
I don't really see why background enters it
If everybody is the same as every body else... no body would be missing any thing.
And people... rich people... they've all different things.
Have everything they want.
Where as poor people... they don't have nothing and they know that.
And they know that they have got nothing.
So they know they are missing something.
What are you missing?
Well... possibly a bike and a fishing rod and...
Ya, they like...they can get what they want, can't they?
We've got to work for it. they just ask for money. and get it. and buy what they want.
What effect does that have on them?
Spoilt it spoils them doesn't it if you want to accuse us
The public schools are producing snobs... by mixing only a couple of classes, the upper and middle
And Comprehensive Schools can be accused of producing proles because they only mix with lower and the middle.
So its like saying that public schools like Tom Brown school days...
We do mix with people from the town.
They can be all right.
Yeah, but I don't like people who are too posh they look down on every body else.
They think they are better.
-Yeah.
I think the people are much more conscious of wanting to become snobs... because the difference that... the differences that use to separate the classes... have diminished greatly.
I mean everyone was a Duke when he used to be set above... everybody else... but now... look at the Duke of....!
I think people climb less class cultures... beacuse I mean... with hippies you don't get the impression... that one hippie says...
I'm so big guy because I'm upper class and you're... some petty person because you're lower class.
Yes.
And any body can become a hippie.
I think this is happening through out the country.
........they don't enforce... being upper class and... things like that... as st pauls..they suggest that you don’t have long hair and do get it cut. they teach you to be well mannered but not to sniff on the poor people. some are good with their money and money and give it... for charitable purpose.
Some of them just do not know what to do with their money.
They just spend it...waste it.
People need it.
I don’t like poverty for any body.
It kinda depresses me.
When I went to Glasgow... and I saw the Gorbals
That rather upset me.
Why?
Well, to think that people are living in that state.
When we waste things... every day.
Some people are just born into rich families and they're lucky.
I don’t see why they should have the luck when people worked all their lives and they've got half of as much as they have doesn't seem fair.
I usually get about a five or six pounds a week
What do you do with it?
I save some, spend some.
Well, I get a pound a week.
And... what I usually do in the middle of the week... my mom takes half back and I save the other half as much as possible.
Well, out of my permanent job
I get four dollars fifty.
40 pence a week
What do you spend it on?
Well, I need to spend very little on schools.
I collect stamps so...
I spend quite a lot on them.
My dad gives me about three pounds a week...
And mum gives me one pound fifty pence
And my brother give me some.
Mr.Gosling gives me four pounds, pocket money every week.
I don't want to be rich but I like to have enough money.
What do you mean by enough?
Enough to have a nice house and... be able to send the children to a private school if I want to.
I mean almost everybody likes money.
Not for the fact that it....
I don't like looking at money
It doesn't give me any pleasure like that.
But I certainly don't want to be poor or live in a slum but...
I had...I don't...
I mean a person with one million pounds is not going to be much... is not going to be more or less happy than a person with two million pounds.
Money is not every thing.
It means a lot to us now the clothes and new fashions and skirts and that
You need money because...
-Yeah what's skirts they're clothes... yeah, you need clothes money can’t buy happiness. -Oh no! you got to work for that yourself havent you
Do you want to be rich?
I don't mind i like staying where i am
I don't want to be very rich but
I don’t want to be poor either.
What about you Jackie?
Just live comfortable. -Ya just have what you want, nothing stressfull as long as you've got all you need.
Do you want to be rich?
I won't mind.
Do you want to be rich?
Yes, because I don't want to be tied down to the... the dullness of an every day job.
I want to be able to have enough money so I can indulge in... things that interests me... like collecting paintings.
No! No because if you're rich you get bored of being rich.
Same... if you're poor, you get bored of being poor.
You can't have too much of a good thing.
And if you're healthy and have good friends, you can get on perfectly well. but everybody would like to be rich.
Mainly to be self-sufficient.
To feel that you don't have to owe anything to any body.
I would help people... if I had a chance.
By say, giving... little bit of money to charity or sponsoring things or things like that.
I mean it is wrong, one should drive oneself... to make a lot of money because in the end... you might have caused so many people.... ruined so many people that you will be unhappy and what's the use of lot of money if you're unhappy?
You've to have it to live and... though, sort of problems you have to face and every thing is concrete and doesn’t seem to be possible for anything to be invisible or... you can’t see it.
I mean people... all the sciences said we've looked up into the space and we haven't seen God so there isn’t a God.
And it just seems fatuous
Do you believe in God?
I'm not sure whether I believe in God
I think to myself I don't know.
So...I don't know.
Yes, I'd say I believed in God.
Are you religious?
Well I go to Church with my parents on Sundays.
You got to believe in something.
So God seems to be the most logically really.
I am not deeply religious. No,
I don't believe in God.
Why?
That's a difficult question to answer `why?'
I just do
It's either a `Yes' or `No' question.
You're brought up to believe in Him and i do.
You must've your own opinion on that as well.
Ya...
-I don't really know
I mean if I do or not.
Don't really think about it very much.
No, you don't have much time to think about it
No when there's so much activity in in school and after school.
I would like to certainly think about or talk to some one about.
When I sit down and think...
I think I believe in God.
But if somebody just asks me I will say `no'!
Supposed just to be big
Why do you believe in God?
I believe in God because... somebody had to make the world this world they call Him what everybody else calls Him Which is God.
You can't really say if there is God or not. Can you?
You haven't seen him.
You can't say!
When you were seven, you wanted to be a Missionary. any thoughts on that?
No I don't want to be a Missionary because I can't talk about it to people.
You know...
I'm interested in it myself but..
I wouldn't be very good at it at all... and I wouldn't enjoy it.
Why won't you be good at it?
Well...
I'm just not very good at... at standing up in front of people and making a speech or any thing like that
I like to keep it private, you know
Well, going to Africa... and try and teach people who are not civilized... to be more or less good.
And after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge.
I am going to work in woolworths
I might go to Oxford.
I'll just walk around... and see what I can find.
Then we think, I am going... to Cambridge and Trinity Hall.
I don't think I need to go to university because I'm not gonna be a teacher.
I don't think you want to go to university if you want to be an astronaut
What does university mean?
Well...
When I grow up I like to find out all about the moon and all that.
If I can't be an astonaut I think
I'll be a coach driver.
It is probably linked up with the fact that now I like traveling.
My thought hasn't really changed
I would like to be a Coach driver now.
You wanted to be an astronaut when you were seven.
Ya!
What feelings have you got on that subject?
Well, changed now completely of course.
I mean it was just the imagination of a seven year old.
I'll buy myself a nice new made house that's all nice and comfy.
I would like to be a... have a happy family.
I mean I know it's not possible to be happy all the time... but as much as the time it was possible.
Just... be content with what
I'm doing and be happy with it.
And to know where I'm going... and to remember fondly what I've done.
I think I'm following a legal career... with a view to ending in parliament.
I would like to do may be shorthand typing or some thing like that.
Nothing too much, just wonder.
Be like every body else.
Nothing too... marvelous!
What would you do if you don't make it as a Jockey?
I don't know. If I knew
I couldn't be one...
I would get out of it wouldn't bother.
What do you think you would do then? i'll learn taxi's
A Taxi driver.
There is a danger that you would get married... at the early twenties and have children quickly and then be... stuck at home.
Have you any thoughts on that?
I don't really think very much.
-I know.
I don't think...
I'll get married too early. I like to have a full life first and...
Get some job before.
-Ya. before you commit yourself to a family
How do you think England would change over the next few years?
England?
-Yes.
Not very much!
England is too English, you know what I mean.
Are you a traditionalist?
Yes!
In what way?
I like tradition.
Do you expect to live your life in England?
I think it's just about the best place you can live your life in England
Why?
I think the
Parliamentary System is agreeable.
I mean... to me at least and... and that's about it.
One's free in England. one has good opportunities for everything.
Well, we've got much more equal opportunities.
In those days the people at the bottom really had to work.
Like Blacks...so that they could achieve something.
Now a days... to get kicks out of life... you've to use synthetic means where originally... earlier on... forty years ago... these things came in life.
With the coming... with all the modern world... we are in the modern world today.
All... lots of these things've been stopped.
Lot of enjoyment of life has been taken out of it.
Yes! The natural enjoyment.
Nothing is being taken out.
It’s just people.
It’s still there if you look for it.
How many people can look for it?
- how many people can look for it.
- Every body can pursue happiness.
At the end of their very special day in London... after their trip to the zoo and the party... we took our children to an adventure play ground... where they could do just what they like.
There's from a children's home set about building a house.
That's Nicholas.
And Tony.
Andrew.
And Bruce.
John.
Suzie.
Jackie and her friends.
Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man.
This has been a glimpse of Britain's future.
The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner
For instance,
I saw this bowl here, and the way the shape recedes, it's as if an explosion had happened, and the force cannot escape properly and is caught up everywhere.
Here you can see how everything is caught up, all the energy, and yet it's full of tension.
I've made a sketch to give me an idea how to set about it.
Ski-flying has reached the point where it's beginning to present real dangers.
We've just about reached the limit,
I believe, as far as speed is concerned of the manageability of skis whereby the slightest wind, or bad snow, make it plain dangerous.
We all get a bit scared, especially if we see a colleague crash-landing, which I never do because I never look when someone crashes, because after a fall or a poor flight, your heart thumps like mad, even during the run-down a bit.
The heart-thumping you get before a start must not be interpreted as being like the fear you feel just before a car crash and you see that something is going wrong.
If a man were that afraid, he'd be finished with ski-flying.
He wouldn't squat down to it.
He'd just jump straight ahead, and his skis would be pushed upwards.
Maybe he would jump off like someone who'd never jumped off a ramp before.
That's why ski-flyers don't like people talking of fear.
They talk about
"respect for the conditions" or some such things, but never of fear.
I think we could jump off higher ramps.
But there'd be very likely jumps attempted and carried out that might lead to more accidents.
We're approaching the limit.
Maybe I'd prefer to turn back, go back to flying off
150- or 130-meter ramps.
But it's the thrill of flying so far that nevertheless gives me a kick as long as nothing happens to me-
I'd rather not talk about that.
The last jump and fall you just saw was by Walter Steiner in 1973 at the opening of Oberstdorf's huge ski-ramp.
Walter Steiner landed at exactly 179 meters.
That's this mark, and this mark is, in fact, the point where ski-flying starts to be inhuman.
Walter Steiner was in very great danger.
If he'd flown 10 meters more, he'd have landed down here on the flat.
Just imagine, it's like falling from a height of 110 meters onto a flat surface:
To certain death.
Strange as it may seem,
I can say I'm standing exactly where this film had its inception for me.
Shooting began in autumn 1973 during the Swiss team's training in Austria's Bad Aussee.
There the mat-ramp allows jumps of up to 70 meters.
We had decided to shoot with Walter Steiner because he's absolutely in a class of his own nowadays.
To my mind, he's the greatest ski-flyer there ever was.
His 179-meter jump at Oberstdorf was, after all, 10 meters more than the present world record.
But it didn't make him world champion, you might say just because he flew too far, and the jury had to interrupt the jumps and start from a shorter run.
So his over-long flights were all discounted.
We began shooting around New Year 1974 at the 4-Ramps Competition.
Jumping on the Schattenberg Ramp was televised live, and so we were more interested in events on the side.
These are jumpers from the Soviet Union.
Steiner,
Switzerland.
Walter Steiner was still suffering from a fall two weeks back when he entered the competition.
He had slight concussions and a cracked rib.
The competition was won by Aschenbach of East Germany, who had become ski-flying champ ahead of Steiner.
It must be remembered that East German jumpers start the season highly trained, with about 10 times as many practice jumps over the year than all their competitors throughout the world.
Nobody was at all interested in the beaten Walter Steiner.
I remember sitting in school, listening to the teacher talking, and he said,
"Walter, you're day-dreaming again.
What is it now?"
My thoughts were somewhere else all over the place, except in school.
I kept dreaming of flying, made some models and plans of models bigger than I could ever build myself.
Maybe that's why I suddenly took off one night and began flying but not just 100 meters, farther and farther down the track, seeing myself suspended over the slopes and landing very gently somewhere.
It was all sort of in slow motion.
When you get to the flying part, you feel the tautness in your head, not before.
Maybe I can even shut my mouth because I feel it's superfluous, just a cramping up.
Then it's all easy.
That's when you become aware of what's going on.
That's what's great about ski-flying.
13th March.
The evening before leaving to jump in Planica, Yugoslavia,
Walter Steiner prepares his skis once more.
The running surfaces have 6 grooves to keep dead on track.
Then they're 21/2 meters long, much longer and heavier than ordinary skis.
Wax is then ironed on.
Early on March 14th,
Walter Steiner leaves Wildhaus.
This is the house he lives in.
Steiner is well-prepared for the only ski-flying this year.
There are only 4 to 5 ramps in the world big enough to warrant talking of ski-flying and not ski-jumping.
We have now arrived at the giant ramp in Planica.
Today is March 15th, first day of training.
However, the organizing committee has decided this training may count for the competition, if conditions on any competition day are bad.
The weather counts for a lot here, of course.
It has begun snowing, but there's very little wind.
We've got two super high-speed cameras on the job.
They take slow-motion pictures that slow the action down 10 or 20 times.
Looking at the starting list we have here, it's surprising that there are no Soviet jumpers, nor any from Japan.
Of the East German jumpers, usually top favorites in these events,
Aschenbach and Kampf are absent.
But world-record holder
Wosipivo is here, and I think we might possibly see a new world record during training even or a new ramp record, since they've set the start fairly high up, and it's not known how the farthest will jump.
Walter Steiner was nervous before his first practice jump because he heard on the loudspeakers that mediocre jumpers before him were managing fairly long jumps.
He decided on caution jumping at half-strength.
Steiner's first practice jump,
1/20 speed.
Steiner sails past all the marks.
He lands in the run-out section.
Confusion in the stadium, because they can't announce the distance immediately.
It must be a new ramp record!
You jumped further than the critical point.
I soon realized I was going too far, but I didn't jump all out, and-
Congratulations!
Up there, I felt like giving up.
But I realized if I let things go,
I'd fly farther and come down with a bump.
You see, that's where they're measuring.
The distance signs won't go that far.
169 meters!
That's a record for this ramp, and it equals the Oberstdorf world record flight, though this ramp in Planica is smaller.
It was going too far from the start
I realized at once.
But, still, I'm glad I stayed on my feet.
I didn't think I'd make it.
Do you think tomorrow will see even longer distances?
No, I hope they'll be more careful now.
Is this really too far for this ramp?
Yes, it's too far.
Otherwise they'd have distance markers if it wasn't too far.
But they're bound to shorten the run now.
Yes, that's for sure.
I sensed it.
When an American- they're not bad jumpers- but still, if they get up to 140 meters or even farther, to 150 meters, that's enough for this ramp.
And then let me come down!
But I thought last year on the small one, it was getting too far and said so.
Then I jumped badly and almost felt a fool.
This year, I thought, "Give it a try!"
I worked, thank goodness!
Before the second day's practice, the jury shortened the run one section so as not to endanger the jumpers.
Yet still, Steiner was afraid he'd sail down onto the flat even with the shorter run.
We couldn't really see what happened.
He seems to have had a bad fall, and I heard the loudspeaker saying he'd jumped 179 meters.
I'll try and find out what happened.
There was a moment's total confusion because Steiner wasn't visible from the run-off tower where I was standing.
All we could assume up the tower was that this was the end of our film on the second day's practice already.
I thought, "That's it!"
Is he injured, or could he still walk?
We couldn't see properly from up here.
He hurt his side a bit, but it isn't bad.
But he's not sure whether he'll go on jumping.
I don't think it's too bad.
He isn't even concussed.
Up here, the run is being shortened again.
These pictures were taken just after the fall by one of our cameras.
Steiner was taken to hospital badly shocked.
Later, he told us the fall had made him lose his memory for a moment.
His distance,
8 meters above the world record, but not counted because of the fall, was told to him 5 times, but he kept asking about it.
He also tore his starting number off and later didn't know why.
Will you be jumping?
I'm all right, but they won't believe it.
You've now exceeded all expectations.
Will you still jump?
I'll have to see If you have any trouble with that eye later on.
You'd better come back for some ointment, but not now.
Are you jumping?
I don't know.
I have to think.
Got to think things over.
My mind's not too clear.
Steiner didn't want to show it, but it was quite noticeable he wasn't yet too steady on his feet.
After all, his head had struck the ground at 140 kilometers per hour.
We'll be showing the 177-meter flight in slow motion.
The sound you hear was recorded a minute later on the spot in a cabin that was too dark for filming.
I tell them something, and they laugh at me and say I brood too much.
They say there's no need.
Things would be okay if they listened to one man, and that's me.
I have a right to talk that way.
But as soon as I open my mouth, they say I brood and talk rot.
So I have to prove it, but proving it isn't so funny, not funny at all.
Yes, I proved it in Oberstdorf.
But they didn't even believe it there.
They keep saying I brood too much, meaning I have to break my skull before they believe me.
It would be too good to be true!
Well, we'll see.
Maybe they'll listen this time.
But probably they won't listen till I give up ski-flying.
We didn't find Steiner till 20 minutes later.
He'd gone off alone to the woods.
This was his great moment of crisis.
He later said people expected too much of him trying to force him into a new world record or see him bleed.
He said, "I feel I'm in the arena with
50,000 people waiting to see me crash."
Nevertheless, he ascended the run-off tower a third time, but he didn't know whether he would really jump.
The question was whether he would ever be able to jump again.
Steiner did a third jump after all.
166 meters, again beyond the critical point, again breaking the old ramp record.
Why did you jump so soon after your fall?
Is it psychologically important?
Yes, if I hadn't jumped again,
I believe I'd have been pretty afraid,
I mean, felt too much respect for ski-jumping.
As soon as I had a good jump just afterwards,
I knew things were okay.
That was what saved me.
Today is Saturday, March 16, 1974.
It's the first day of official competition in Planica, and they'll be starting in about an hour.
As I see, there's a problem.
It froze over last night, and today the run-down must be extremely fast.
Even yesterday they started right down, and the run can't be shortened any more.
The worries about Steiner started all over again.
Thank God, the sun soon came out and softened and slowed down the track.
Improvised field kitchens filled the valley with smells of onions, garlic, and cevapcici.
50,000 spectators turned up, and it all looked a bit like a great pilgrimage.
People had seen Steiner's astounding flights on TV the day before.
Steiner, Switzerland, will voluntarily start a section further down so as not to throw the whole series out of gear.
Walter Steiner, as far as I know, did something never before attempted.
He started one section lower down than the other competitors.
He'd certainly have crushed the competition because his incredible superiority would have caused such a shortened run that nobody would have done over 130 meters.
If the others did 140, he'd do 170 meters.
Mr. Steiner, why did you start lower down?
Well, if anyone else hits the 140 mark,
I have to reckon on flying too far, judging from yesterday's results.
And it's scandalous that they didn't shorten the run today and even lengthened it two sections.
It's inadmissible.
Yesterday they let me jump too far four times.
That shouldn't happen.
It's scandalous of those Yugoslav judges up there, who are responsible.
Today it was wet, and I had to reckon on it being a nervous strain to start lower down, but I had to.
I couldn't take the risk.
But it makes no matter.
I want to ski-fly.
And this was the first time
I needn't be afraid.
Autograph, please!
Sunday, second day of competition.
Steiner has a magnificent overall lead.
What about the speed now?
It's now normal.
It's enough.
It's enough.
I really had a terrific jump there.
You got 20 marks three times.
I don't think that's ever been done before.
It may have happened once, but not to me.
Not in your lifetime it hasn't.
Not with me in any case.
Steiner's flight of 166 meters was probably the most perfect ever recorded in the history of ski-flying.
After this jump, once again, too far for the ramp, they even tried to speed up the ramp once more by protecting it with silver-foil from the sun.
In addition, they lengthened the run and pressured Steiner to try one last time.
He did, but shortened his run by two sections.
Yes, they almost stung me up, surrounding me and saying the whole Yugoslav people would despise me if I didn't jump, and they'd do all they could, and what they did is, started two sections higher up.
I hope the Yugoslav public is now satisfied at least.
How far would you have jumped if you'd jumped from the normal height?
It has to do with thermics.
The jump I've just made wasn't ideal.
I think at 111 kilometers per hour, you could reach
180 meters without difficulty.
Despite voluntarily cutting down his run,
Steiner won the competition with a lead never before achieved in ski-flying.
I once had a young raven.
That was really something.
It was still practically unfledged.
I reared it on bread and milk, and when it could fly, it used to meet me or saw me coming on my bike from far off.
I whistled, and it flew onto my shoulder and came home with me and stayed till I fed it.
Sometimes it waited at the roadside when I came from school.
Suddenly I heard it cawing.
I looked around and saw it was my raven.
And he came flying straight to me.
Unfortunately, he kept losing more and more feathers.
Maybe it was the food it ate.
The other ravens plagued it.
The row started early in the morning.
They cawed.
He tried to flee, of course, couldn't get away, and fell down.
So I'm afraid I had to shoot him.
It was a torture to see him being harried by his own kind because he couldn't fly anymore.
I ought to be all alone in the world, just me, Steiner, and no other living thing.
No sun, no culture, myself, naked on a high rock, no storm, no snow, no banks, no money, no time, no breath.
Then, at least, I wouldn't be afraid.
Koko is a gorilla.
Ally is a chimpanzee.
This is Washoe.
She has already earned a place in the history of modern science.
She was ten months old in 1966 when psychologists
Allen and Beatrix Gardner began an experiment with her that rocked the scientific world.
Washoe is now 12.
She has a vocabulary of about 200 words.
She lives with other chimpanzees on an island at the Institute for Primate Studies in Oklahoma.
Roger Fouts was formerly the Gardners'assistant.
He was involved from the start on experiments with chimpanzees using sign language for the deaf.
No one had ever attempted such experiments with gorillas.
Gorillas were thought to be too difficult to handle, much more dangerous and less intelligent than chimpanzees.
The first birth here was in 1971.
It was Koko, whose mother is shown here.
Koko is available to us only because these gorillas were taken from their mothers, from their native jungle, their parents perhaps slaughtered.
Today, the only place where a gorilla is truly safe is within the concrete walls of a zoo.
In Africa, they're driven out of the equatorial forests by farmers and lumber companies, as well as poachers.
Only a few thousand mountain gorillas are left.
Their only enemy is man.
Even though Koko was born in the San Francisco Zoo, she's still an animal of the primeval forest, an exile.
Koko lives in a suburb south of San Francisco.
This is what's called her cultural environment.
The names of these places -
Redwood City, Palo Alto - serve as reminders that less than 100 years ago, this area was covered by a huge forest.
On the campus of Stanford University,
Penny Patterson, 28, a graduate student in psychology, is teaching Koko sign language.
Koko lives in a specially modified trailer.
Penny lives with her boyfriend off campus.
She has no children.
She arrives every morning before Koko wakes up and returns every night when Koko goes to sleep.
The experiment began five years ago.
Penny hasn't had a single day of vacation since.
Penny's based her work on the Gardners' work with Washoe, but with one important difference.
Tests for intelligence and vocabulary are set up in three different ways.
With signs, with words, and with both at the same time.
The alligator is bottom left.
It's the third from the left.
Koko scores slightly lower than a child of the same age.
Gorillas in the wild are generally vegetarians.
Koko eats hamburgers and takes vitamins like any American child.
Twice a month,
Koko's life is recorded on videotape.
Twice a week, a tape recorder is used instead.
Every word Koko uses each day is checked off.
Sometimes Koko makes up sentences, and these too are taken down and analyzed by a computer that extracts their grammatical structure.
Koko doesn't know what to make of her new yellow sweater.
She wants her old red one.
It was cold that day.
Gorillas are sensitive to cold and easily catch pneumonia.
At four,
Koko loses her first tooth.
The event was filmed in Super 8.
This game was thought to have been invented by Koko.
In fact, it's a game played by young gorillas in the jungle.
This time, it's Koko's turn to ask Penny something.
How far can Koko progress?
Koko's health is carefully monitored.
Her urine and blood are analyzed regularly.
Since early childhood,
Koko has been in daily contact with deaf-mutes.
Gorillas reach puberty at six and are fully adult at nine.
Their average life span is 50 years.
When this film was shot,
Koko was almost six.
She experienced her first sexual stirrings during the filming.
There's a newcomer in Koko's life.
Michael, a young gorilla of four.
He already knows a dozen words.
At first Koko was afraid of Michael.
Then she became jealous, and then curious.
Now she loves him.
They'll have to wait at least three years untiI Michael reaches puberty, which comes later for males, to have children.
Watch this.
Koko wants to see Michael.
A lesson in progress.
Koko works two or three hours a day.
Then she gets tired.
Gorillas in the wild live in strict hierarchical groupings.
Each gorilla must obey its superior in the group structure.
Penny, with a place in that hierarchy, must enforce that relationship or risk danger.
All education implies dominance.
How could Penny avoid transmitting her own values?
Koko may become the first white American Protestant gorilla.
This film was shot practically in secret.
Koko was still the property of the San Francisco Zoo.
The zoo was threatening to send the police to recover Koko.
Penny adamantly refused to give her up.
She was ready to run away with Koko, or even live with her in the zoo compound.
In the end, the Gorilla Foundation, which Penny created, bought Koko.
Then we went to see the zoo director.
Is this Koko's rightful place?
Would you have called the police to get Koko back?
Koko doesn't have a voice.
Primates' vocal chords only allow them to emit a handful of cries.
Koko is learning to use a new tool, a computer that speaks out loud for her.
Every 10 minutes, for several hours a day, the new machine invites her to its keyboard.
If someone killed Koko, would it be murder?
No. To the law, killing an animal is a mere misdemeanor.
Would a child who behaved like Koko be put in an institution?
But why must man be our only standard?
Is the question whether Koko, because she can speak, deserves some special status accorded by man?
Or is it a question of an animal's right to live according to the rules of its own species?
It seems what's been called intelligence no longer designates only that intelligence in full awareness of itself, but also that intelligence that lives spontaneously, unselfconsciously.
In fact, Koko raises all the important questions about man.
One can't decide a priori that only human beings are persons.
One could prove that this gorilla is a person.
In our society, a person has certain rights, limited as they may be.
To grant these rights to primates is to open the door for the animal world.
Since the dawn of Western civilization, we've lived with the idea of man created in the image of God, intrinsically different from animals and nature.
In the wake of Darwin's theory of evolution, language was the last remaining bulwark for this worldview.

I went down to the mountain,
I was drinking some wine.
I looked up into heaven,
Lord, I saw a mighty sign.
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white.
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight, uh huh huh.
Hey, Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
Everybody's dancing down the local skating rink with a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
Temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high.
Come the rocking strike of midnight, the whole place is gonna fly, uh huh.
Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
I turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news, says I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues.
His wife says don't get crazy,
Lord you know what to do.
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes, uh huh.
Hey, Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth, thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it planet earth.
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord,
You'll know it when it comes.
When the rocking, rolling music meets the rising, shining sun, uh-huh.
Hey, Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh,
One more Saturday night.

- Anybody else?
- Hold it.
It's too late.
We'll get it together later on.
Just a moment we'd like to do something that's never been done before because there are men, for years and years, who've worked with the Dead, who've made it always possible, getting all this equipment up.
For once, let's really get them up.
They're shy, we're very, very crazy... the Grateful Dead crew.
Will you all come out here, please?
Come on!
Ram Rod, Steve, get your asses out here, come on.
Healy, Jackson, Joseph...
Let's go, everybody.
Get 'em all out here.
Here's the man, right there...
Ram Rod, right on!
Come on, Sparky.
Here he is, one of the best guys in the business, Bill Graham!
Billy, this is the proof.
For ten fuckin' years, they've done it.
Really, once again, for the crew.
Thank you very much.

- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)
Don't wanna be treated this a way.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)
Don't wanna be treated this a way.
I guess we should go to Benny.
I know. And then there's the main guy in regards to covering that whole front there.
That's gonna be something that we're gonna have to clear through him.
I think it might be better if you dart around behind all the stuff.
That's pretty hard.
There ain't that many holes, you know.
Well, I know but that's...
That's how few there are.
Try to get 'em over the top.
Think about it.
'Cause that would be the hippest.
- Then, you'd have the...
- But the scrim is so high.
Hey, man, I know, but you'll just have to get stuff to happen down here in the middle somewhere, by timing it.
That means it can only be that stuff I throw.
I can't set 'em up spray planes, I can't...
It's not your decision to make.
It's not my decision, either.
- Is Bill Graham here?
- He'll be here at 5:00.
It's not so much you guys, it's the people that you guys have had confrontations with during the years.
They see someone in here with colors on and they remember the time maybe he got stomped by seven Angels and goes fuckin' berserk.
I mean, I've seen it happen a dozen times.
A thousand...
Oh, you know what?
Sandy's flying out here from New York, and I know he's not taking his patch off, so he's coming a long way for nothing.
I say if Bill Graham thinks I'm that violent,
I ought to just knock him out and leave.
You know, give him his satisfaction.
Hold it now. Stopping!
What was it the sound system, or what?
Some of the Grateful Dead albums
I worked on...
I was a co engineer on several of their early albums.
You don't engineer no more, or what?
I've been...
The last couple of albums,
I've been going to the pressing plants and overseeing the actual record pressings to make sure the final product is high quality, but not actually working on the albums.
Now, I have my hands full.
Burned to the ground, but resurrected from the ashes.
We're always working on the piano tuning.
What is it about this guitar that makes it so...
Like most basses or guitars that you hear have one or two good tones on them.
This bass has many, many good tones and can simulate the sound of other basses.
It has lots of different filters on it, that capability of switching from one kind of sound like the same sound coming from all those speakers to one string coming from each of half of one of these stacks.
So in other words, each string from four different sets, so it bounces around depending on how I play it.
I'm talking to you like you're a person, because you look like a person, even with that camera on.
Getting a little carried away, there.
I'm not trying to do that on purpose.
The camera!
Yeah, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.
Come on, come on, come on.
- We can play together.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah.
Truckin', got my chips cashed in.
Keep truckin' like the doodah man.
Together, more or less in line.
Just keep truckin' on.
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
Chicago, New York, Detroit, and it's all the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream.
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.
Dallas got a soft machine.
Houston, too close to New Orleans.
New York got the ways and means
- but just won't let you be.
- (no, no, no)
Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love.
Most of the time they're sitting and crying at home.
One of these days they know they better get going out of the door and down in the street all alone.
Truckin' like the doodah man.
Once told me,
"You gotta play your hand.
"Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime if you don't lay 'em down."
Sometimes the lights all shining on me.
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me...
What a long strange trip it's been.
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle you know she isn't the same.
Living on reds and vitamin C and cocaine.
All her friends can say is,
"Ain't it a shame?"
Truckin' off to Buffalo.
I been thinking you got to mellow slow.
It takes time.
You pick a place to go.
Just keep truckin' on.
Yeah, our happy home.
This is our mailing address.
That's it.
- That's where I live.
- Five days.
Sitting and staring out of the hotel window.
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again.
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel.
But if you got a warrant,
I guess you're gonna come in.
Busted down on Bourbon Street, set up like a bowling pin.
Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin.
- They just won't let you be.
- (no, no, no)
You're sick of hanging around and you'd like to travel.
Get tired of traveling, you want to settle down.
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for trying.
Get out of the door, light out and look all around.
Sometimes the lights all shining on me.
All right!
Other times I can barely see.
What's that, Greg?
Chiclets.
Lately it occurs to me...
What a long strange trip it's been.
Truckin', I'm a going home, whoa, whoa, baby, back where I belong,
Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on.
I would say we're pretty nuts.
What's it, three in the afternoon or something?
About three in the afternoon, the sidewalk, there'd be some cop runnin' up and down here saying,
"Stay back to this line," you know.
And people just sitting down, gettin' stoned, snortin' coke.
All week long, people are gonna be crazy out here.
How long have you guys been out here?
What'd we get here,
3:00 this morning?
- Where's your mother?
- My mother?
- She's probably at work right now...
- Whereabouts?
...worryin' about me being in line all day.
She works in Oakland.
She's a good mother.
How many people are tryin' to get in?
About seven... at least seven of us.
How many more do we need?
I don't know, we need lots,
'Cause there's always more that pop up.
- I just got one, though.
- I just got one, too.
Great.
Rock and roll!
Grateful Dead! Right on!
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!
You can't carry it in.
Have your ticket out and ready, please!
Have your ticket ready.
There are two doors.
You can't carry that pack in.
I'm sorry, sir.
Thank you very kindly.
March right in and have a good time!
Have 'em out and ready, please.
Have your ticket out and ready.
Have your ticket out and ready.
Have your tickets out and ready.
Have your tickets out and ready, please.
You just wait, man.
They promised that they would play tonight.
Shit, man.
Grateful Dead! Yeah!
Tell me about the Dead.
The Dead, man, gets to be the best band.
No doubt about it, man.
Wherever the Dead are, you see the people, you know?
- Huh?
- What makes 'em the best?
Their sound system, man.
Their music and Jerry Garcia.
He's got it together, man.
They've been together for the last ten years.
They've been together longer than almost any group I know of.
You know, they've got it, man.
They're the best.
- They're the best.
- Besides Jesus.
- What's that?
- Acid, yeah.
I'm caught here
I'm going to try to get in.
You know, the Grateful Dead.
Sure, I have a ticket.
Wanna see it?
Well, you can't stand right there
I know. I'm just trying to get my space together so that I can go into the show.
I just came from a phone call.
Fantastic!
Oh, Donna Jean!
Right outside this lazy summer home.
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no.
Right outside the lazy gate... of winter's summer home... wondering where the nuthatch winters.
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away.
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.
But the heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own.
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home.
Sometimes we ride on your horses.
Sometimes we walk alone.
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own.
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.
Say something intelligent.
Bottom line of the whole scene is very simply stated.
There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert. Period.
Never will be.
If the Dead were to die,
I'd have reason to cry, because the band I used to see would be a cold memory.
But if the Dead were to live, free concerts they'd give.
Jerry G. on guitar would bring 'em in from near and far.
If the Dead were to cease, there'd be no street peace.
We take hold the power, skin the cat and take a shower.
But if the Dead live long, we'll be singing their songs.
We'll all be so glad
Mama hated Diesel so bad.
Grateful Dead!
This is just fucked up, though.
This fuckin' film, man, making cash off everybody.
This is the biggest pile of shit
I've ever seen the Dead ever do.
- You're full of shit!
- Aww, you're nuts, man.
If this film is just...
Five nights of this show, man.
You can have it filmed one night and charge more.
- Would you would you listen to me?
- Yeah.
This film is nothing more than a record album on film.
It kinda gets in the way of everybody who's here, though.
Four or five years from now, you're gonna be grateful that this thing was filmed.
You are gonna pay
4 or 5 dollars to see this film.
I don't know if I'll be alive five years from now!
- Well, neither do I, but if you are alive...
- Well, you're crazy as shit, man!
...you'll be in that theater, and I bet you...
- You wanna bet money on it?
- Yeah.
What's your name?
I'll take your address and I'll...
- My name is John Williams.
- John Williams?
- Yeah.
- Sam Hughes.
- Hi, Sam.
- Okay, I'll bet you anything that I will not be at that movie.
It's always good to see a real Dead Head around...
Yeah, why are you so uptight?
You feel you're being exploited?
- Yes.
- In what way?
Who is going to get royalties?
It's like this if this little thing, which there's no way it's gonna be in the movie, and there were five million people watching this movie all over the world... and I was being in the movie right here, but this is ten minutes of my time...
Say this was all in the movie, these people are being charged, do I get royalties, would I?
No.
St. Stephen!
- Crazy, man!
- You're crazy!
He's crazy because he doesn't realize...
He does not realize...
He's spaced out.
He wants a residual.
I hope this movie comes true, man, really.
It will! We know it will!
The omnipotent Grateful Dead.
Sugar Magnolia, blossoms blooming.
Head's all empty and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river.
I knew she'd have to come up soon for air.
Sweet blossom come on under the willow.
We can have high times if you'll abide.
We can discover the wonders of nature... rolling in the rushes down by the riverside.
She's got everything delightful.
She's got everything I need.
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double.
Pays my ticket when I speed.
She comes skimming through rays of violet.
She can wade in a drop of dew.
She don't come and I don't follow.
Waits backstage while I sing to you.
She can dance a Cajun rhythm.
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive.
She's my summer love in the spring, fall and winter.
She can make happy any man alive.
Sugar Magnolia.
Ringin' that blue bell.
Caught up in sunlight.
Yeah, come on out singing,
I'll walk you in the sunshine.
Come on honey, come home with me.
She's got everything delightful.
She's got everything I need.
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight.
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed.
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying,
When the moon is halfway down, sometimes when the night is dying,
I take me out and I wander around.
I walk around.
Sunshine daydream.
Walk you in the tall trees.
Going where the wind goes.
Blooming like a red rose.
Come on over sweetly.
Light out singing
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Well, come on, come on over daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Come on, come on from a sweet dream.
Sunshine daydream.
Wading in a cold stream.
Goin' out your window.
Goin', goin' where the wind goes.
They're never going to miss us.
Light out singing.
I got you in the morning sunshine.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Come on, come on over daydream.
Sunshine daydream
- Come on, come on from a sweet dream.
- (come on from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
- Come on, come on.
- (hey yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream.
- Well, come on Sweet Magnolia daydream.
- (comin' from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream.
When I dream of a daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
- Come on, come on, come on over daydream
- (comin' from a sweet dream, yeah)
- Sunshine daydream
- (dream)
- Yeah!
- (yeah)
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
- Lord, come on over daydream!
- (yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream.
Sweet Magnolia daydream.
Thank you all, goodnight!
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's nice.
- You're not kidding.
It's always this... a group of the same faces, basically.
And then, there's new people keep coming in over the years, and then older people phase off, you know, advance on to different trips and you don't see their faces as much.
But it's like a continuous trip.
The first concert I went to was the Dead at Fillmore with...
It was on a Sunday afternoon at 1:00 or so, I don't know, when they used to play afternoons at Fillmore with the Airplane and Big Brother, and that used to be really big.
I mean, you never get to see those three at once.
- They used to do it every weekend.
- Really.
See the Dead out at the Panhandle and Golden Gate Park.
But those were the old days.
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine... and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung, would you hear my voice... come through the music?
Would you hold it near, as it were your own?
It's a hand me down.
The thoughts are broken.
Perhaps they're better... left unsung.
I don't know.
Don't really care.
Let there be songs... to fill the air.
When did you first start going to the concerts?
I guess about 1967 in New York.
I remember in the Fillmore and Hartford, Connecticut, and L.A. and Charlotte, North Carolina, and Philadelphia, and just a whole bunch of places.
And all when all the acid things were going on, all the heavy kind of generational changes and everything that was happening in the country, they seemed to really be reflecting that, and so was I.
And so, it just really meant a lot to me.
See that girl bare-footing along?
Whistling and singing, she's a carrying on.
Got laughing in her eyes, dancing in her feet.
She's a neon light diamond.
She can live on the street.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Well, everybody's dancing in a ring around the sun.
Nobody's finished, we ain't even begun.
So take off your shoes, child, and take off your hat.
Try on your wings and find out where it's at.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Take a vacation, fall out for a while.
Summer's coming in, winter's going out in style.
Well, lie down smoking, honey.
Have yourself a ball,
'cause your mother's down in Memphis.
Won't be back till the fall.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Some folks look for answers, others look for fights.
Some folks up in the treetops just a looking for their kites.
But I can tell your future.
Whoa, just look what's in your hand.
But I can't stop for nothing.
I'm just playing in the band.
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.

Standing on a tower, world at my command.
You just keep turning while I'm playing in the band.
And if a man among you got no sin upon his hand, let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band.
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.
Daybreak on the land.
There's no relationship that
I've ever been able to hear on tapes between the way I feel and the way it went down, you know what I mean?
Doesn't matter how I feel.
- It doesn't?
- No.
I haven't been able to hear it matter.
It matters how I feel to me, of course, 'cause that...
You know, I feel that way, you know.
I come off the stage, boy, sometimes really, really upset, you know.
And when I was younger,
I would get even more upset
I'd get more crazy.
I would want it to be really good, you know, and I'd think, wow, it's not where it should be.
It's almost there, but it's not there.
And then I'd get really angry.
I remember one time, we were... we did the Carousel, and we recorded.
I got really upset at the end of the set,
'cause I thought it was just horrible for some reason.
It seemed like everything was a struggle.
And I got real pissed off at Phil and I grabbed him and threw him down this little flight of stairs.
You know, it's like, man,
I've never done that.
And Phil... I've been really tight with him for years.
I was that freaked out, you know, and high, too, you know, flipped out, man.
Music was fucked, you know.
And then we listened to these tapes months later and ended up using 'em on our album, man
They were... You know, they were...
You know, they were crackling with energy.
They were amazing, but that's when I knew, well, fuck, I've just got to learn to keep my mouth shut, you know, and just not even think about whether... whether it seemed like it was happening to me or not.
He's very creative, but you kind of have to kick his ass every now and again.
I have found that, generally speaking,
I create best when somebody holds a gun to my head.
I use a telephone to call him up and ask him if he's written any music so I can write some words,
'cause I've given up on trying to write words and have him write music later.
- And I like it that way.
- Yeah. Gives him the upper hand.
I call myself a four-sided schizophrenic, because you have to have four separate ideas going, all right, and then a single thing here.
It's more than patting your head, rubbing your stomach, because you're doing it with four things.
And that sort of relates as to why when you get that down in music, in drumming, particularly, then you get so you can be dancing, and that is really fine,
'cause you sit back there and it feels just like you're dancing.
You're playing and the groove is just right and the kicks aren't made the accents and the rolls, they're not made, they're just into the flow.
And that's the kind of music I like.
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.
Daybreak on the la
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.
Daybreak on the land.
Playing.
Like the wave upon on the sand.
Daybreak.
While I'm playing in the band.
I'm waitin' for Bob, man.
- So? Bob who?
- Weir.
Listen, I'm doing some electrical work at his house.
What's your name?
Okay, listen.
We're doing work at the house,
I gave him my card,
I'm his chef, he says come on down, give me the card, you'll get in.
You're either on the list or you're not.
What's your name?
My name's Levy.
Just give him my card, he'll say let 'em in.
- Give us your card.
- I gave it to this dude.
I'll take it.
So, now, if you'd come to that door, there, and then come out, then we could've let you back in.
But if you come out the side door, we have no way of tellin' you whether you were sick or not.
But how about the fact that I...
You have to come out this door here.
I know but, I'm from New York
I've come 3,000 miles to see this concert.
Yeah, but darlin', you should read the signs.
Can you get Bob Weir for me?
I gave your card, what more can I do?
Now, hush...
Anyway, get out of here.
I wouldn't come out here to see it and not, you know, have a ticket to get in.
I'm not gonna come 3,000 miles...
What's up, miss?
What's the problem?
Well, I came out the side door because I needed air and it was cool air, and I walked around and now I want to come back in.
I have absolutely no way of knowing that.
Thanks a lot, love.
You keep it.
- I don't want it.
- All right.
- What's your first name?
- Jeff.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
Well, honey, you told me you're not walking around...
Do you know a guard or somebody that saw you walk out, if he comes here and tells me that he's seen you inside,
I'll let you back in.
All right, I'll go and look for him.
Tickets only.
Tickets only.
Ticket, sir?
No.
Sorry, we're all sold out.
When all the cards are down.
There's nothing left to see.
There's just the pavement left.
And broken dreams.
In the end there's still that song.
Comes crying like the wind.
Down every lonely street.
That's ever been.
Stella Blue.
Stella Blue.
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying.
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time.
Gonna make them shine.
It all rolls into one.
And nothing comes for free.
There's nothing you can hold... for very long.
And when you hear that song.
Crying like the wind.
It seems like all this life... was just a dream.
Stella Blue.
Stella Blue.
Next.
- Yeah, can I get a hot dog?
- Wet hot dog.
- Anything else?
- Yeah, can I...
- Pardon?
- Can I get some mustard on it?
Mustard's right over there, sir.
Sixty cents. Out of ten.
Do you like any particular group more than another?
- Do you like...
- Sha Na Na.
- What?
- That's my favorite, Sha Na Na.
- Sha Na Na?
- Yeah.
What do you think of the Dead?
I think their music's too loud.
I don't care for loud music.
That's why I like Sha Na Na.
I do.
Drivin' that train high on cocaine,
Casey Jones you better watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind, and you know that notion just crossed my mind.
This old engine makes it on time,
Leaves Central Station about a quarter to nine, hits River Junction at seventeen to.
At a quarter to ten you know it's traveling again
Drivin' that train high on cocaine,
Casey Jones you better watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind,
And you know that notion just crossed my mind.
Margaret Mead should be here.
- Margaret who?
- Margaret Mead, honey.
- What for?
- What do you mean?
This is it. This is what she always wanted to do.
Really, really, really, fuckin' really!
Really, really, really, really, really, man, really!
Trouble with you is the trouble with me.
Got two good eyes but we still don't see.
Come round the bend.
You know it's the end.
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams
Drivin' that train high on cocaine,
Casey Jones you better watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind, and you know that notion just crossed my mind.

What's left of the vineyards?
What do you want, red, white or green?
White.
Green?
Green might be interesting.
Suck on it, suck on it, suck on it.
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey.
Walk me out in the morning dew today.
Can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey.
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning.
I thought I heard a baby... cry today.
Thought I heard a baby... cry this morning.
You didn't hear no baby... cry today.
Where have all the people gone.
My honey?
Where have all the people gone... today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people.
You never see those people... anyway.
I thought I heard a young man... mourn this morning

I guess it doesn't... matter... anyway.

I guess it doesn't... matter... anyway.
Thank you.
Thanks a whole lot.
We're gonna change a little bit of equipment up here and play some more in a few minutes.
Thank you.
Where the fuck's the water?
Water, just plain, old cold water.
Lots of it.
Where have they taken my guitar case to?
That's the stuff.
Hey, Barney, look who's here!
I know!
I saw her last night for the first time.
Got some cake?
One more time, anybody?
- One more time?
- One more time?
- What do you want to do?
- Let's decide.
I guarantee you, this way is the only way you'll get out this door.
Wait a minute, where's the drummer?
Some of you folks might remember our old drummer,
Mickey Hart, who's playing with us tonight.
Fresh out of a mental institution, and a brand new man.
He still has uncontrollable urges to throw things.
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens, there is an old cabin made of earth and wood, where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode.
He never learned to read or write so well, but he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell.
Go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny B. Goode.
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, go sit up in the trees by the railroad track.
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade, strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would all stop and say
"My but that little country boy can play!"
Go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny B. Goode.
His papa told him
"Someday you will be a man."
"You will be the leader of a big old band."
"Many people coming from miles around"
"will hear you play your music when the sun goes down."
"Maybe someday your name will be in lights,"
"saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."
Go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny B. Goode.
Thank you all.
See you sometime.
What am I going to do?
I'm going straight home and get into bed.
I've been here since 9:00 yesterday morning, and I must go home and get into bed.
I'm going straight home and get into bed.
Straight home and get into bed.
Go home before you kill yourself.
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!
Annie laid her head down in the roses.
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair.
I don't know, maybe it was the roses.
All I know,
I could not leave her there.
I don't know, it must have been the roses.
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
I don't know, maybe it was the roses.
All I know,
I could not leave her there.
Ten years, the waves rolled the ships home from the sea.
Thinking, well, how it may blow in all good company.
If I tell another what your own lips told to me,
Let me lay beneath the roses, let my eyes no longer see.
I don't know, it must have been the roses.
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
I don't know, maybe it was the roses.
All I know,
I could not leave her there.
Everybody seems to be ready.
Are you ready?
For the first time in three years, the greatest rock 'n 'roll band in the world, the Rolling Stones!
The Rolling Stones!!
We're gonna have a look at you.
We're gonna see how beautiful you are.
All right!
Oh, New York City, you talk a lot.
Let's have a look at you.
Let's have a look at New York City.
Well, all right!
Welcome to the breakfast show.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're just gonna wake up.
Well, all right!
Charlie's good tonight, isn't he?
I think you really-- you really dressed up tonight.
Aren't they?
We'd like to see how you look.
Can we see how they look?
Let's have a look how they look.
Come on.
Oh, we just want to see how they look.
Ohhh, we couldn't see you!
We couldn't see you.
It's really hard to see this together, isn't it?
It will take time.
- What?
- Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.
Do you think you can do it that quick?
This gives us the freedom.
All you guys watching us.
We may only be on you for a minute, then go to almost anything.
This is Stefan Ponek,
KSAN Radio, San Francisco.
Well, the Rolling Stones' tour of the United States is over.
They wound it up with a free concert at the Altamont Speedway for more than 300,000 people.
There were four births, four deaths and an awful lot of scuffles reported.
We received word that someone was stabbed to death... in front of the stage by a member of the Hell's Angels.
Nothing's confirmed on that.
We were there.
We didn't see it, but we did see a lot.
We want to know what you saw.
Our phones are open.
We'd like to hear from you. What was the Altamont free concert like?
The Angels did as they saw best in the difficult situation.
As far as I'm concerned, they were people who were here... who tried to help in their own way.
- Right? You know?
- Hmm. Right.
If people didn't dig it,
I'm sorry.
That was Sam Cutler, one of the organizers of the free concert.
I think we've got one of the Hell's Angels on the line.
Sonny Barger.
Have I got that right, Sonny?
- Yeah.
- Okay, what's up?
I didn't go there to police nothing, man.
I ain't no cop. I ain't never gonna pretend to be a cop.
And this Mick Jagger, like-- put it all on the Angels, man.
Like, he used us for dupes, man.
And as far as I'm concerned, we were the biggest suckers for that idiot that I can ever see.
And you know what?
They told me... if I could sit on the edge of the stage... so nobody would climb over me, you know,
I could drink beer until the show was over.
That's what I went there to do.
But you know what?
When they started messing over our bikes, they started it.
I don't know if you think we pay $50 for them things... or steal them or pay a lot for them or what.
Ain't nobody gonna kick my motorcycle.
And they might think because they're in a crowd of 300,000 people... that they can do it and get away with it.
But when you're standing there, looking at something that's your life, and everything you've got is invested in that thing, and you love that thing better than anything in the world, and you see a guy kick it, you know who he is.
You're gonna get him.
And you know what? They got got.
I am not no peace creep by any sense of the word.
And you can call them people flower children and this and that.
Some of them people was loaded on some drugs... that it's just too bad we wasn't loaded on... because they come running up the hill, yelling "Aaaah" and jump on somebody.
And it wasn't even always jumping on Angels.
But when they jumped on an Angel, they got hurt.
Well done, Sonny.
I think I remember him.
Do you?
No, I'm not certain.
I don't really remember what he looked like.
There was a couple of them before we went on.
They were really very nice, you know?
A couple of them guys.
It's just, uh--
I don't know.
I mean, the way they cleared the path, for instance, was incredible.
Were you there? Was you in the party that had to be led to the stage?
- My goodness.
- I saw what they did, yeah.
That was insane.
What did they do?
Well, it's just the way they did it, you know?
It's very, very--
'Cause before that,
I didn't really think there was anything going on, you know?
Really. I didn't hear anything
'cause we were right at the side.
Oh, dear, what a shame!
KSAN Radio here. The violence at Altamont was completely unexpected.
The Rolling Stones had performed for overflow audiences... without incident in major cities across the United States.
Okay, roll it.
Thank you.
Well, all right.
Well, all right!
Well, all right!
Well, all right!
Are you any more satisfied as far as your career goes?
Do you mean sexually or, or philosophically?
- Both.
- Yeah, we're more satisfied now sexually, aren't--
How about philosophically and financially?
Financially dissatisfied, uh, you know.
Uh, sexually satisfied, philosophically trying.
- Rubbish.
- There's a question here on the right.
I read in one of the papers that you'll be giving... a free concert in San Francisco.
We are doing a free concert in San Francisco.
- When?
- On December 6.
And, uh, the location is not
Golden Gate Park, unfortunately, but it's somewhere adjacent to it which is a bit larger.
It's creating sort of a microcosmic society, you know, which sets the example to the rest of America... as to how one can behave in large gatherings.
This is Mel Belli, the lawyer in San Francisco.
Uh, I'm-I'm talking for the Rolling Stones.
We've got their managers and their principals here.
I've just heard that you've offered them your speedway... for their performance on Saturday, is that right?
- That is correct.
- This is an open phone so we can all talk on it.
What I'm trying to find out is what we can do to do this concert.
For the last 36 hours, I've stood my organization on its ear, Mr. Belli.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm coming in late and trying to straighten something out.
So tell me exactly what it is without--
Yeah. My first area of policy concern:
I do not want this gesture... on the part of Mr. Jagger... to cost me five cents.
If a blade of grass is torn down, they are going to build it up again, you know?
I was involved in Woodstock.
I've represented rock groups, and I've been involved, both as an attorney and as an executive, with festivals.
No matter what anybody tells you, they're a pain in the ass.
Don't turn me into a proctologist.
Just tell me what I can do here.
Well, somebody tell me why I should want to get this concert going.
Are you trying to make it so they can't do this?
No, I want it to happen, but I'm not prepared to rebuild my goddamn racetrack.
Will you come up and see if you can work with me on this thing?
I'd love to work with you, Mr. Belli, but are you working with Mr. Jagger?
I haven't met Mr. Jagger.
I've only met these other people here.
- Have you met Mr. Schneider?
- Yes, he's right here in the office.
All right, fine.
He knows what happened at our meeting this afternoon.
Then call me back and with the thought... see if you could come up tomorrow morning.
- You and I can see what we can do with this damn thing.
- Okay.
All right, call me back.
There's no way to do the concert except in that location.
As it stands now, you're gonna have at least 100,000 kids there by Saturday.
You don 't have any alternative.
The only thing you can do... is to do an affidavit, temporary restraining order and talk to one of the judges.
So that brings us down to this.
Um, I'll call one of the judges right now.
That's your only chance of forcing these people to do it.
Now, don't scare off from these people.
If I were advising them,
I'd tell them to hide out.
Because right when they're coming out, you'll-- sh-ta-boom!
- Yeah, but it doesn't come in till the solo.
- I know, I know.
- What is that?
- What?
- Stickin' out of your pocket.
- Cousin Minnie says,
"How delicious!"
I'm taking it home for Robert.
Y'all come back now, ya hear?
That's one more song.
That should be it.
I found it. I found it.
Anybody in?
Is my local groupie in?
Hello, darling.
How are you?
When are the bags coming up, Ronnie?
Stew's gotta get 46 pieces up.
We're gonna do--
We're gonna do a slow blues for you now, people.
You like that?
I like it.
This thing is going on.
The Chronicle is coming out with a story that it's off.
- This has been building up for a long time.
- Well, it's off and on.
Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
All right, let's see if we can get some facts... to build together on an affidavit here.
So we'll have that available and then a very short order to show cause.
The sheriff wants to know who's going to go to the bathroom and where.
They've got a nice little bucolic community there--
They know practically when every john is flushed... and the orderly habits of the bathroom of all of their, uh, voters.
Dick Carter's on the line.
He's offering us the speedway at Altamont.
Hello, Dick.
This is Mel Belli for the Stones.
If they were to perform in the speedway, is the speedway open so that they can be seen... from the people that can't get in?
I'm sure we can work something out.
I want the publicity.
You want the publicity?
Well, you take the publicity.
The Rolling Stones don't want any money.
It's for charity.
- So I'll take the money.
- All right.
All right.
Well, why don't I do this?
Why don't I talk with these people here... and then I'll get back with you... and then if we have to sign anything up... and if you need any insurance, which I'm sure you will want, and all the rest of that stuff,
I'll work with you in the morning.
- Okay.
- I'll call you back later, after I talk with them, Dick.
Bye. He's offered the Altamont Speedway.
- There's not enough room.
- There's not time to move it.
We got to tear down a stage and the scaffolding.
The phones are in. The generators are there. Everything is left to go.
It's anticipated that the amount of kids now traveling across country-- you may have anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 kids... starting to arrive sometime tomorrow.
They're all lining up at the airports from as far away as New York.
- Now? You gotta be kidding.
- You have no idea what goes on here.
It's an amazing phenomenon.
It's like the lemmings of the sea.
- Mike Lang is on the line.
- Yeah, Mike?
John says that he doesn't think you can make it over there at the Altamont Speedway.
- Do you want to talk directly to Mike?
- Yeah.
Mike, I got the impression from everybody where you are... that there was no way of moving to that speedway.
We can do it.
Nobody wants to, but if we have to, we can.
Just a quick question.
You were at Woodstock, and you've now been to Altamont?
- Right.
- How does it stack up?
Do you have the room?
I think we have the room, sure.
I think we can hold as many people as want to come.
Can you change locations that fast?
We had a much bigger operation to change at Woodstock.
I don't think we'll have much problem.
We're just dealing with a free concert.
That's what we want to present.
And I think that's what the Stones are up to. They want to play here.
Is this going to be Woodstock West?
Well, it's going to be San Francisco.
Do you have any special feelings about this kind of a concert?
This spontaneous, free--
Well, it's not so much--
I don't think it's a complete concert.
The concert is just--
I think it's an excuse.
You know, because, like, the thing is, it's just like everyone coming and having a good time.
The concert's like the proscenium of a theater.
It's like an excuse for everyone to just sort of, you know, get together... and, like, talk to each other and sleep with each other... ball each other and get very stoned... and just have a nice night out and a good day, you know?
- I mean, do you understand?
- I do.
It's not just like getting up there and seeing... the Grateful Airplane and the Rolling, Rolling Dead.
And now, Ike and Tina Turner.
Thank you.
I don't know what they paid for them-- the costumes-- but is there any way--
Good. It's nice to have a chick occasionally.
Far out.
Sorry you had to wait.
Oh, yeah!
Thank you kindly.
I think I busted a button on my trousers.
Hope they don't fall down.
It's that jumping around.
I'll have to do it up again.
Whoo! You don't want my trousers to fall down now, do you?
We're gonna--
We're gonna kiss you good-bye.
And we leave you to kiss each other good-bye.
- Hello?
- Yes, Mel?
- Yes, we still have you.
- I got you in an echo.
Think you can pick it up?
I'm practicing. I'm going on first before the Rolling Stones.
Can we get you to pick up the phone like before?
Well, what it is now, we're waiting for Mr. Carter to come in.
But I've just had a letter read to me... where he said that he very definitely... wants the Stones and the concert there.
So, as of this minute, we're intending that the show go on.
They have 200,
300 people working... and it's going to be quite a problem to get the thing set up at the Altamont Speedway.
But it will be, and it will start at 10:00.
Now, that's where we stand.
I'm waiting for Mr. Carter now.
Uh, let me ask and see.
Are the Rolling Stones all in town?
- Not yet. They're coming tonight.
- They're coming in tonight.
But everybody's ready, and they're all set to go.
That's where we are.
Is this Mr. Carter?
Sheriff, Mr. Carter just came in.
Now, could we talk a little bit?
I can put this on the box so that we can all hear.
And I think, to start,
Mr. Carter has expressed... his willingness to have this on his private property over there.
But the question is of this narrow road to come in there.
Do you foresee any problems on that?
Well, that basically is the Highway Patrol's problem, and they foresee problems.
How many cars can Mr. Carter park on his property?
150 cars per acre?
150 cars per acre times 80 acres.
- How many?
- 150 times 80.
- 12,000 automobiles.
Well, up in Tallalamee County, they estimated they had 80,000 cars.
What are we going to do with them?
There's much open area around there.
I can probably arrange with other landowners.
There's one adjoining me that has 2,000 acres.
Yes, well, we have some of the adjoining landowners complaining before it's even granted.
If there's 50,000 cars that Mr. Carter can 't park, we're in trouble.
8:38 now at KFRC.
This is Frank Terry, and let me repeat:
The Rolling Stones' free concert is going to be on tomorrow at Altamont Speedway.
Apparently, it's one of the most difficult things to give a free concert.
As you all know, the concert was originally scheduled for Golden Gate Park... and then at the Sears Point Raceway.
Many, many volunteers went out to Sears Point... in trucks, cars, trailers, everything, packed up all the gear out there and took it to the Altamont Speedway... where they are right now, in the cold, 30-degree weather, setting up the stage, setting up the generators... the sound equipment and the facilities for the people.
We're gonna end it now.
Good-bye.
Well, all right!
We got to go!
We got to go!
We got to go!
We got to go!
They hit Mick. Somebody hit him.
- Come on over.
- I hate you!
Keith!
Do you think he'll be coming out?
Oh, Mickey, Mickey,
Mickey, Mickey.
I can't function. I've been on the scaffolding almost all night.
I can't close my hands. They're formed to the shape of the scaffolding.
You people that are hanging on that scaffolding, you're rendering that scaffold unsafe by climbing on it.
Those scaffoldings are not built to take very heavy weight.
So if we could have some sort of reason, whatever that might be, we'd be very pleased.
Arthur, in between moving around, always turn that off.
Turn it off and turn it on.
Look, you've got to be very cool with that little thing.
Even though it's supposed to be electrically correct, man, you got to really think right around it.
Are you gonna hear some music today?
Hey, you want me to just leave this in here?
No.
Hashish.
Hashish.
L.S.D.
Psilocybin.
Hashish.
Make them comfortable.
Even this parking situation back here, it's all wrong, but that's the way the kids park.
For once, we're just gonna let it happen.
For experimental purposes.
You know what I mean?
So be as easy on this as we can.
It won't hurt the Stones in any way.
Wow!
Wow, but I wanna be smart, but you're just so far out.
Because... yeah!
They should be back when they discover we're not with them.
Since we've got the beer and the food, they'll find us.
Well, a guy's freaking out over at the tent there--
So, tough shit.
What do you mean, tough shit?
The guy's really freaking out.
Keep-Keep your--
No, I don't mean tough shit.
What I mean is that... if you lay successive numbers of bums on this crowd, by the time 6:00 comes around, they're gonna be in a real mood.
I'm not prepared to stand here laying bum trips--
Up at Woodstock this was done, and you were there, and you know.
And announcements were made.
We're just sort of getting there, basically.
If we make it.
I've been falling a lot lately.
Let's go this way.
Whoa! When did this happen?
There's already a doctor over there.
A chick's having a baby.
She's having a baby.
Contributions to Panther Defense Fund.
Contributions to the Panther Defense Fund.
They're trying to either wipe out the Panther party... by jailing all the members and wiping them out economically, financially, or violently through killing them.
After all, they're just-- they're just Negroes, you know?
Need that cannon pretty bad.
We just had our first baby born at Carter's Altamont Speedway.
Yeah, right, yes.
- Just had our first baby born.
- Oh, wow.
Okay so far.
Everything's all right.
- We have a helicopter standing by.
- Can we get a mike?
If the press will push this:
Dick Carter's Altamont Speedway, not just Altamont Speedway.
This cat right over here.
He just told me to do it, man.
No, well, I'm sorry.
Nobody else goes there except me.
I'd really like you to get off the stage, baby, please.
Okay, well, I can dig that.
- Thanks very much.
- Uh-huh.
The American Red Cross has asked us to secure these supplies.
If anyone has any of these things to contribute.
We need Ace bandages.
Ace bandages, gauze and sponges.
If you have any of that equipment, please bring it to the medical tent... or to the Golden Gate Chapter
Disaster Service Red Cross truck.
Excuse me.
Which way is the stage?
Around the corner?
You mean that way?
I think we're in pretty good shape, though, right now.
We're in chaos backstage.
We'll never get--
That's gonna have to be cleared,
'cause the group's gotta come in.
What we need to do is start getting some blokes together--
The essence of it, as far as I'm concerned, is this is where the work has gotta go.
- Right.
- Sling them all out.
No fucking about. We've had enough of being polite. Get out, go away.
- I've asked. I know.
- So if you could help us, that would be groovy.
- Sure.
- All these people, you know?
I want to see Mick Jagger, goddamn it. No!
Can I say just one thing before you take her off?
- Just let me say one thing.
- I will not!
Hey, before you go away, man.
Don't tell me what to say, okay?
You look after your job, baby, and I'll look after mine.
You're trying to stop me.
I'm trying to ask you--
Will you ask all these people that are milling around if they'd move to the side, man.
He wants to listen to you.
- You want a bong?
- She wants to get fucked.
That's the way!
You don't belong here, man.
- Let me have some of that.
- I wanna get up on stage.
The organizers, who number about 20 people, would really like to thank the hundreds of people who came out here last night... and worked all night to get this on.
Thanks to everybody who helped.
And I'd like to point out to everybody here... that this can be the greatest party of 1969 that we've had.
Let's have a party, and let's have a good time.
The Flying Burrito Brothers!
Please stop hurting each other.
Please stop hurting each other.
You don't have to.
Take him out the other side!
Take him out the other side!
Hey, man, quit crowding.
Just back off.
We need a doctor under the left-hand scaffold... as soon as possible, please.
They're not gonna play music till we get a doctor.
Somebody help.
Somebody's hurt!
Marianne Faithfull is here.
You feel like signing a few albums?
Let me have that album.
Where's that album?
Thank you.
Well, I'm not stepping outside.
- I don't blame you.
- I am. I want to.
-Just sign this.
- But I can't get very far.
Sign this, please.
Sign this one too.
Hey, what about the free records and all the rest of the shit?
There are a number of people on and around this stage who should not be here.
Consequently-- Consequently, the musicians on this stage... are playing with something like
200 people breathing down their necks.
Now, can I please ask that everyone leaves the stage... and, as I say, we'll go back to playing music and nothing else.
The Jefferson Airplane.
Jefferson Airplane.
Easy!
Easy!
Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Yeah, it's all right.
It's kind of weird up here.
Hey, man, I'd like to mention that the Hell's Angels... just smashed Marty Balin in the face and knocked him out for a bit.
I'd like to thank you for that.
There's other ways--
Hey, wait. Is this on?
- You're talkin' to me,
I'm gonna talk to you.
- I'm not talking to you.
You're talking to my people.
Let me tell you what's happenin'.
You is what happenin'!
Hey! Oh!
- No! No!
- Watch it. Hold it.
- No, stop it!
- You know what's happening?
- What's happening?
- We're partying like you.
No! No!
Um, you know, that's really stupid.
Hey, man, you guys don't have to stay on the stage.
They're not gonna hassle us.
- Hey.
- They're not really that--
That's really not worth it.
You don't hassle with anybody in particular.
You gotta keep your bodies off each other unless you intend love.
People get weird, and you need people like the Angels to keep people in line.
But the Angels also--
You know, you don't bust people in the head for nothing.
So both sides are, uh, fucking up temporarily.
Let's not keep fuckin' up!
- Oh, that's what the story is here?
- Yeah.
- Oh, bummer.
- Really bad. I mean, like, it's scary.
- Who's doing all the beating?
- Hell's Angels.
- Hell's Angels are beating on musicians?
- Marty got beat up.
- A fight on the stage.
- Doesn't seem right, man.
It's really weird, man.
It's really weird.
- Oh, man! Really?
- There's lots of people.
Get that cleared!
Let's get it!
Oh, babies.
There's so many of you.
Just be cool down in front and don't push around.
Just keep still.
Keep together.
Oh, yeah.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Keith, Keith, Keith!
Keith, will you cool it, and I'll try and stop it.
Hey, hey, people.
Sisters.
Brothers and sisters.
Brothers and sisters, come on now.
That means everybody just cool out!
Will you cool out, everybody?
- A fight broke out.
- I know. I'm hip.
Everybody be cool now.
Come on.
All right?
How are we doing over there?
All right?
Can we still make it down the front?
Is there anyone there that's hurt? Huh?
Everyone all right?
Okay?
All right, I think we are cool.
We can do--
We're always having--
Something very funny happens when we start that number.
I need to get down with it now.
All right!
Uh, people, who's fighting, what for?
Who's fighting, and what for?
Why are we fighting?
Why are we fighting?
We don't want to fight.
Come on!
Do we want--
Who wants to fight?
Who is it?
Hey, you know, I mean--
Every other scene has been cool. Let--
Look, that guy there, if he doesn't stop it, man--
Listen, either those cats cool it, or we don't play.
- Come on.
- You gonna stop?
We need a doctor!
If you don't cool it, you ain't gonna hear no music!
Now, you wanna all go home or what?
We need doctors down here now, please.
Can we have a doctor down here now to the front?
I-I cannot see what's going on.
I just know that every time... we get to a number, something happens.
I don't know what's going on, who's doing what.
It's just a scuffle.
All I can ask you,
San Francisco, is like the whole thing.
Like, this could be the most beautiful evening... we've had for this winter, you know, and we've really--
Why don't-- Don't fuck it up, man.
Come on, let's get it together.
I can't do any more than just ask you, beg you, just to keep it together.
You can do it.
It's within your power.
Everyone, Hell's Angels, everybody, let's just keep ourselves together.
You know, if we are all one, let's show we're all one.
- Preach it, brother!
- Up on the scaffold. Urgently, man.
There's one thing horrible that we need.
Sam, we need an ambulance.
We need a doctor by that scaffold there.
If there's a doctor, can he get to there?
Okay, here we go. We're gonna--
I don't know what we're doing.
When we get to really the end and we all want to go absolutely crazy, and, like, jump on each other, then we'll stand up again.
You know what I mean?
Everyone keep-- sit down.
I mean, just keep cool, and let's just relax.
Let's just get into the groove.
Come on, we can get it together.
Come on. Sit down.
Hey, man, look. We're splitting.
If those cats can't--
If you people-- We're splitting if those cats don't stop beating everybody up in sight.
I want them out of the way, man.
I don't like you--
A guy's got a gun out here, and he's shooting at the stage.
- It's one guy.
- He's got a gun.
Hey, people.
Hey, people.
Come on, let's be cool.
People, please.
There's no reason to hassle anybody.
Please don't permit it.
If you move back and sit down, we can continue and we will continue.
Can you roll back on that, David?
Sure.
Did you see what was happening there?
No, you couldn't see anything.
Well, it was another scuffle.
There's the Angel right there, with a knife.
- Where's the gun?
- I'll roll it back.
You'll see it against the girl's crocheted dress.
Right there, isn't it?
Oh, it's so horrible.
Is there an officer?
Is there a policeman here?
- What happened here, anyway?
- Man, he pulled out a gun.
- He did?
- Yes, the Hell's Angels took the gun away from him.
One of them has it now.
He showed it to me.
And they proceeded to put him down on the ground and started kicking him.
And he has a couple of stab wounds in his back and one over his ear.
We tried to keep him alive, but when we got here, the doctor checked him out and that was it.
We pronounced him dead at about 6:20.
We have a request from the state police.
- I don't want him to die!
Don't let him die, please!
- He won't die!
Now, they're gonna do everything in their power.
- But they can't hear his heart.
- Now, don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
- They're gonna put him in this whirlybird and take--
- I have to go with him.
Get back, please.
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Oh, yeah!
Come on in!
All right.
See you all.
All right.
- Paging Dr. Flores, Dr.
Adkins, Dr. Flores.
Dr. Antonelli, Dr. Antonelli, Dr.
Flores.
- Get your oxygen on.
- Yeah, we had oxygen.
- Has she ever had diabetes?
- Not that I know of, no.
- Has she ever had a heart attack in the past.
- No.
- After the stroke that she had, that was what year, by the way?
- That was in '66.
- Right.
After the stroke, was she able to talk?
- Oh yes.
- She had no problem with speech?
- No.
- Did she have any problem with using her arms or legs?
- No, well her left side was somewhat-
- Her left side? - Yes.
- And what happened today at home?
- Nothing, last night she was all right.
And well, the doctor said when she, you know, sometimes she gets a little excited like, you know what I mean?
He told me to give her one of the pills.
When she, he told me to give her the pills three times a day, and one one times a day.
- What color were the pills?
- I told you, one was tan and one was blue.
And so I gave her one of the pills last night to relax her.
And...
- Calm down, I'm trying to help.
And she usually gets up at 6:00 to eat before I go to work, but this morning she didn't wake up.
So I said, well maybe...
Maybe she was a little bit more tired.
So after I fixed breakfast and everything, she was still sleeping.
When I shook her, she wouldn't wake up.
- So it all happened in her sleep.
- Yes.
- Was she feeling all right last night?
- Yes, she was all right.
You come inside in a little while and we'll give you a tranquilizer.
- Were you vomiting the other day?
- Yeah, I was vomiting.
- After the tranquilizer.
Have you had any red vomit?
Bloody vomit?
- No blood, no.
- How about your stools, what color have they been?
Your bowel movements?
- They look like they was turning black.
- Black.
- Yeah.
- The color of my watchband.
The color of this, this color?
- Yeah.
- How many days have they been black?
- About four days now.
Black.
- Any diarrhea?
- Huh?
- Have you had any diarrhea?
- No, I haven't had diarrhea.
- What'd they do, what's this operation for?
- Huh?
- What's that operation for?
- Alcohol.
- Yeah, that's right, he was operated for alcohol.
- Well what do you mean, you were operated for alcohol?
- I'm an alcoholic.
Acute alcoholic.
- Okay, now listen to me.
It's very important that I know if it was a pill, or did you shoot up?
What?
Was it a pill, or did you shoot up?
- Heroin.
- Heroin?
How much did you take?
One bag?
One bag?
- Yeah.
No cops around here.
- No cops, no cops.
- Here, let's give her an IV.
- Yes, this is Dr.
Schwartz calling from Metropolitan
Hospital Emergency Room.
We received a patient from New York Hospital about two hours ago by the name of Inez Watley.
I wanted to inform you that the patient was transferred over here, and conditions of the transfer were really absurd.
First of all, there was no, absolutely no note came with the patient at the time.
There was no note as to who the doctor here, who was contacted, who accepted the transfer.
There was no note as to what the laboratory tests or condition of the patient was when seen by a doctor at New
York Hospital.
There was absolutely nothing that came over.
I called up and I was able to get in touch with the resident, I don't recall his name now, who did see her in the Emergency Room, and he related her condition to me rather superficially.
It turns out the patient is an active upper GI bleeder.
She may or may not have to go to the Emergency Room, to the operating room tonight on an emergency basis.
Now I think that this patient's life was actually put into some sort of jeopardy by transferring her in this condition.
And I would just like to say that this is the sort of thing that we see all the time, and whenever it happens,
I make it a habit of calling the administrator and voicing my complaint.
This is just not in the best interest of the patient, regardless of how many rooms there are or aren't.
No, this is Metropolitan.
Patient's name is Inez Watley.
She's an active upper GI bleeder.
We don't know, it's up to the surgeons.
They're seeing it now.
No, I can't tell you.
I believe it was medical,
I really don't know.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
- How long have you been hard of hearing?
- Ever since I was
18, and I'm 68 now.
- You were born in 1901, right?
So you've been hard of hearing since...
- In '62, then the company went on the blink, then I was laid off.
- I mean how many years have you been hard of hearing?
- Well, that would be
40 years, wouldn't it?
- Since about 1929?
- No, since 1919.
It's been very hard.
- I can imagine,
I'm telling you.
- It's harder than when you have to wear glasses.
- Now tell me, do you have any kind of private medical insurance?
Blue Shield?
- No. - No.
- Except the Medicare.
Blue Cross wouldn't take me on account of the diabetes.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
- I tried to get it.
And then they told me they would only give me something if it was not the diabetes that caused it, and usually diabetes causes all kinds of ailments.
- That's right.
- The eyes, I've spent a lot of money for the eyes.
But I have no disease.
The doctor was afraid I maybe have a disease.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now.
- It's just been hard for me.
Now this comes off, a new hearing aid, the teeth, and now all these check-ups the man wants.
Six, seven different ones for the laboratory, chest x-rays.
That's all, I have to pay first but they give me back on it.
But the first $50.00 I have to pay myself, and $48.00 I have to pay for the Medicare.
So it's just been, and if I draw and use up my income, what am I gonna do?
You see, you wanna remain self supporting.
You don't want the government to support you.
Everybody has that in them, don't you think so?
We want to do what we can ourselves.
- Yeah.
- If you can.
Except when need comes.
- Yeah.
- And I'm trying to avoid that.
- Yeah, I know.
- And I pay $64.86 rent a month.
Plus my utilities.
- You're not a Veteran, no?
- No.
But I did work for the
UMRA overseas once.
And I had an UMRA uniform.
I was tied up, I had settled in Germany when I was young and married.
Then due to WWII I had to come back because the Russians took everything.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
- Now I sign?
- Yeah, uh-huh.
You have to sign here, and here.
Well I thank you very, very much.
- 152 and a half.
Have a seat.
You keep that, that's for you.
Okay.
This way, sit down here.
- Just relax your legs, just let them hang loose.
No, this is not loose, looser, looser.
Loose, loose, like they're hanging in water.
Just like you're sitting in water, okay?
- The drinking just eats into your stomach.
I'll give you some other medicine to relax you so you won't get so nervous.
- I like to eat, so when I chew, so if I have a couple of beer or two, it's good.
- Yeah.
It's not good for you.
- Let me see your teeth.
- Would you like to have your teeth fixed?
- I would like to.
I try to pull them out.
- You don't pull them out yourself.
- No, no, I pull pieces out.
- All right, well we'll have you seen in the dental clinic.
Come over here, let me take your blood pressure.
Are your eyes blurry?
- No.
- What happened to your eyes?
- It gets dark, couple minutes.
Dark, completely dark.
- Okay, I'm gonna look inside your eyes.
Do you have any trouble passing your urine?
- No.
But I got something there that's bothering me.
Down there.
- In the where?
- You know.
- Yeah, what happens when you pass your urine, does it burn or itch?
- No, my thing itch too much.
- It itches.
You have itching right on it?
- Sometimes I wanna scratch it.
- Do you have bleeding?
- When I scratch it,
'cause I wash up, and I clean real good, and then I itch, and it bleeds.
- It does.
- Yeah.
- We'll have to get that checked today.
- Not inside.
- Outside.
- Outside on the bottom.
This is the thing, over here, on the bottom.
- Around the rim, it itches.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry to tell you.
- No, no, I wanna know, because
I have to fix this up.
But how about when you pass your urine, does it drip out?
- No.
- Does it come out in a nice stream?
- Come out nice but, when I stop it-
- Yeah, you feel like you have to go more?
- No, when I feel it stop, and put it in my pants it drips.
- Drips.
Okay, we'll have to, yeah.
- I don't like to tell that to you because I'm ashamed.
- No, don't be ashamed.
No we wanna fix this up.
We wanna make you feel better.
I have to know all these things.
All right, you come sit down over here.
- I think I have cancer.
- You think you have cancer, well we have to check you up.
I don't know that you have anything like that to worry about.
I think I have cancer.
- Where do you think you have it.
- That thing.
- That, you want me to look?
I'm sorry, you want me to look at it?
Do you want me to check it?
Or you prefer to have a man doctor look?
You want me to look?
- If you wanna.
- All right, let me check it for you.
Just lie down.
- I'm ashamed.
- No, no, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
All right.
Now what I'm gonna do for you,
I'm gonna give you a pill for the diabetes, and have you see the dietician.
She'll tell you what to eat, and how to eat it.
I'm gonna get you an appointment to have yourself checked up in the GU clinic.
And I'm gonna send you to the dental clinic.
All right.
And we will have your counseling nurse talk to you.
We wanna find out whether we can possibly get you some other kind of work where you don't have to be on your feet all the time.
- Hold it in, please.
Stop breathing.
Breathe.
Now stop breathing.
Breathe.
Swallow some more.
Stop breathing, please.
Breathe.
Stop breathing, please.
Breathe.
- We took x-rays of it and it showed nothing.
His calcium when he came in was rather low.
Low calcium and a low phosphorus.
- You say the murmur is better?
- I can hardly hear it, at least I could hardly hear it yesterday.
- Has the risen this week?
- Yeah, right now it's 33, yesterday it was 33.
- That hurt?
Again?
Could you sit up?
Have you heard anything?
- Never.
Maybe if you project you can hear some tubular breath sounds.
- Breathe through your mouth.
Say 99.
- Now whisper, one, two three.
- Whisper.
One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
- Whisper, one, two, three.
- One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Pick up anything else?
- Huh?
- Can you pick up anything else?
I think you have to apply something's lugging.
- Since I have to be around tomorrow, will you tell him that Dr.
Gordon and I feel that we should have a tissue diagnosis?
Can I talk to you?
Despite the fact that the patient's getting better.
Boy, you're all tied up here, huh?
Okay.
You feel cold?
Okay.
- Good evening ladies, how are you?
- Good evening.
- I have your medication for you, dear.
Sit up, you need to sit up here.
Take it easy.
- Thank you.
- Stay still.
Let me feed you with the milk sitting up.
Now it's good to the last drop.
All right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, Miss Michaels.
- Thank you very much.
- Okay, take a breath, relax.
Okay dear.
Was that good?
You want a little more juice?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, Miss Harris, come dear.
That's your medicine.
That's your medication, ma'am.
- All right, now that we've done that, let's get to the brain proper, and we do see the very, very mild flattening.
The brain looks like a rather small brain.
Let's weigh it now.
You see, after fixation, it's only 970, about.
It's a small atropic brain.
The convolutions are small.
And I think this was a significant.
I think one of the reasons her symptoms maybe were not so alarming, or progressed very slowly, is there was probably a lot of room in the cranial cavity because of the atrophy of the brain.
Quite a bit of herniation of tissue right to left, indicative of increased intercranial pressure.
At the base of the brain, also we find a deep herniation.
There's quite a mark through here.
That's also one of the best we've seen in a few weeks.
Can you see it?
Also on the right side.
Now one other point of interest is that there is a little focus here of yellowish brown discoloration of the left meninges, and normally the, as you know, the arachnoid acts as a good barrier, and none of the fluid gets, none of the blood, I mean, gets into the subarachnoid space.
'Cause anthrocomy is blood clots that profuse through.
This may indicate either that she had a tiny little subarachnoid hemorrhage at the same time, or that a little bit of blood did leak maybe along one of the bridging veins and get inside of the subarachnoid space.
I think I'd like to take a section of that now, so I don't lose it.
Because I'm interested to see if we'll be able to pick up a hemosiderin microscopically.
All right, I think that covers, her focal seizures presumably are due to pressure.
They were left-sided.
This is behind the central so I presume that this did not have any significant focus.
It reminds me of the plaque Jean of chronic alcoholics who had head trauma.
Epileptics with chronic alcoholism who had multiple head trauma get these yellow plaques, what we call plaques Jean.
- The vastus medialis is man's last muscle.
It is the last muscle to have come into man's anatomy in any proportion.
Only man has a screw home position of the knee.
Only man has a long last geometry.
Only man can rotate the legs inward and outward.
This is a man's problem.
A horse, or any of the quadrupeds, must rotate by dipping one leg down, but there are no rotatory muscles.
Only man can develop cerebral palsy.
Because only man has a wine glass geometry.
So therefore when they try to imitate cerebral palsy, in the experimental animal, it's a waste of time.
It's just as much as we try to prove by thousands of experiments producing hip dislocation in a dog.
And we say now we know by understanding that the dog, that dislocation happens in man.
It's a totally different type of dislocation.
Only man can develop that type of dislocation,
'cause man has a different geometry.
Man is not born with disease, he acquires these disorders.
When he tries to adapt to a certain level of civilization.
- Yeah Dr. Plume, this is
Miss Tille the OR supervisor, can you give me the report?
Yeah.
Yeah, let me tell him.
The lymph nodes didn't show any malignancy.
Yeah, go ahead.
Anything else?
Nothing.
He has a report, no malignancy whatsoever.
Okay?
All of them, doctor?
All of them.
Okay?
Thank you very much.
- Why don't you bring that chair over.
Just relax.
Relax.
Take a deep breath and let it all the way out.
Okay, good.
Everything's all right.
- No he should not return home.
The grandmother is incapable of taking care of these two children.
She's intoxicated.
Of course, the child cannot return to a home with the environment that, the father of the child with a grandmother that, you know.
She didn't even know the kid was gone.
That's right, she didn't even know the child was gone.
- Well, I think the child was left with a grandmother that was completely intoxicated and incapable of taking care of the child.
They're refusing to come down here, the parents, we can't locate them.
I think something should be done about it.
We talked to the grandmother, the grandmother knows the child is here.
- And she's not coming.
- She's not coming.
She refused to come to the hospital.
- Are they gonna admit him?
Is there a possibility, can we admit the boy for 24 hours, just so I can send a telegram to have the father pick him up?
Because I want social service to investigate the home environment.
Because the child is not fit to go home.
He fell.
It's a neglect ward.
- It's improper supervision.
- She wants to refer the child.
I want her-
- He's getting a bed.
- All right, would you fill out a neglect form?
All right, she's gonna fill out a form.
Nina, this is Midge.
Now I know the old goat is there, so answer yes or no.
Do you have a bed in the ward?
Just answer yes or no,
I can hear her breathing down your back.
Yeah, what I want is a bed.
Well, really nothing.
I mean, there's no disease, but I need a bed.
And I was hoping you and Dr.
Hewitt could figure out how
I could get one.
A bed for a little boy who doesn't have any place to go.
I'll give him anything you want, what do you want him to have?
Where's the boss.
Okay.
- Are there any other siblings in the home?
- We don't know 'cause we haven't had any kind of family to talk to or nothing.
All we know is this kid fell.
- The child fell out of a window that was 15 feet.
- Fifteen feet, straight down.
- Not 15 floors, 15 feet.
- 15 feet straight down.
- Okay, a child fell out of a window, people called the police, the police came to the home.
- Right, three policemen brought the kid to us.
- Mrs. Kelly says that by law we can't keep this kid.
But by law.
- But common sense you can't discharge him either.
- I could take him home for one night, but what would I do with him in the morning?
- Oh no, don't you get involved in something like that.
- I really don't know what to do with the kid.
- Well, he'll be placed, don't worry about that.
You get him cleaned up, Josephine, there's nothing wrong with the youngster, right?
Nothing wrong with the youngster.
He's just ready for disposition.
- You think I could get something for him to eat from the kitchen?
- Don't worry about anything, Louis.
Don't worry about anything.
You have to go upstairs though.
The doctors wanna take a look at you.
- When can I leave here?
- Tomorrow morning.
You see?
That don't make sense.
- There's nothing, everything okay for me.
- We'll make sure your children are safe so you don't have to worry about them.
- This is too long.
- That isn't a long time to wait, Louis.
It's very important to your children.
- I feel right now.
- If it was all right for you to go home, the doctors would've told you to go home.
- The main thing we don't wanna do is have to manhandle or anything like that.
- Well, I don't wanna hurt him.
He don't wanna go.
- I know that.
- I would suggest some action, that's my point of view.
- Some action?
- Yeah.
- Well I'm trying to alleviate action.
- It's up to you, doc, what's your decision?
- It's not up to him, it's up to me right now.
- Well, what do you say?
- I say let's wait until the social worker comes over.
- All right.
- That's a long time.
- Right, 'cause that's his main concern.
He has to feel concerned about his family.
He has young children, nine, eleven, and seven.
- All right now, you have children at home now?
- Yes.
- That's right.
- Three children.
- Three children.
Who are they with now?
- They're waiting for me.
- They're waiting for you, there's no grown-up person with them?
- No.
- How old are the children?
- One 11, one nine, and one seven.
- They're not in school today?
- Hmm?
- They're not in school, they're waiting at home for you?
- Yeah, waiting for me.
- Uh-huh.
Who gave them lunch?
- Hmm?
- Who gives them lunch?
- I did, this morning.
- You gave them lunch this morning.
I see.
What about the lady who lives next door?
Is she watching them?
- They watch television.
- Where's their mother?
- Mother left.
I don't understand.
I gotta go now.
- I know you've got to go now.
- I gotta get my kids.
- But you're gonna end up back here in the hospital even sicker.
- Because I'll buy some medicine.
- If the medicine would settle it, we would give you the medicine here.
You need to be in the hospital for the doctors to treat you here in bed.
- I'll take the medicine.
- Do you get any money from the welfare department?
- Because I feel all right.
Everything okay now.
I feel all right.
- Do you get money from the welfare?
- I'm working.
- You work.
- Yeah.
- Did you ever get any money from the welfare?
- No.
- Never.
- I'm working.
- What kind of work do you do?
- I work in the bar.
- At a bar?
- What hours do you work?
- I work there Friday.
- What time do you go to work?
I wake up at 6:00.
I get out at 3:00.
- And who is with the children at night when you're at work?
- I let them stay, because the bar is over here,
I live over here.
Every time I go upstairs,
I check on my kids.
- Oh, so you check.
So you leave them home alone and then you go back and check on them.
- I check, because the bar over here,
I live right here.
I go upstairs and everything okay.
- Yeah, I understand what he's saying, but he's also difficult to reason with.
- Because I'm working, I work.
I don't play.
- All right look, I want you to listen to me.
The doctors say you must stay here for your health.
For your future health.
- I don't wanna stay.
- We don't wanna keep you here just because we wanna keep you away from your children.
It's important for you.
If you got hurt more seriously then you think-
- I don't wanna stay.
- And you are not treated, you could die.
Then who's going to take care of the children?
- No, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm against this.
- I can arrange to have someone come in and take care of the children for you.
If your father can't do it, and no other relatives can do it,
I can have someone come in.
- No, I can't.
- Is there anyone else?
- I feel all right, I just need some medicine.
- If you feel all right, why do you need medicine?
- I'll buy some medicine someplace.
- I know you're worried about taking care of your children.
But is there any other reason why you will not come into the hospital?
- I don't wanna stay here.
- No one wants to stay here.
No one wants to be in a hospital.
- Come on, Louis.
Come on, Louis.
You have to go up now.
You have to go up to the ward.
Come on.
- Right now?
- Now, we have to go upstairs.
- I don't wanna go upstairs.
- Listen, come on.
Come on, Louis.
Come on.
We ain't gonna hurt ya.
Come on.
Come on, Louis.
- I'll do the rest of admission upstairs.
- In homosexuality, you experience this a lot.
When there isn't a man who looks like an average
Wall Street worker, and he has his suit on, and his tie, and his hair combed to the side, looking like a million dollars.
And if another homosexual should pick him up, take him home, he'll tie him up, beat him.
These are things that are not normal.
And this is what I mean.
- Mr. Beevis, I wanna establish one thing with you.
- Yes.
- There are lots of people who have this problem, and I recognize it as a problem, who can get along very well.
And I wouldn't, if somebody wanted to be that way, or even didn't wanna be that way, but felt he couldn't do anything about it,
I wouldn't try to change it.
But I might try to help him to get along with it.
- Well, listen, like I told them, and I'll tell you.
I'm willing to accept therapy because I feel that being what I am,
I'm not a normal human being, and I recognize myself.
You see, not normal.
It's just a fact that when
God created this earth, he made man and woman, not something else besides that, right?
So like, I'm not normal.
I would be abnormal.
I'm a freak of nature.
So any kind of help that would be given to me in here,
I would assure you that it would do me a heck of a lot of good.
Because I'm having somewhat of a difficulty obtaining what is known as social service, in other words, welfare.
This welfare center has petitioned me, and later they have come up with the statement that I cannot require welfare because I am a minor.
Now, being that I-
- Because why?
- Because I am a minor.
But you know, when I do go over to the welfare center, they tell me, "And how have you been supporting
"yourself, and eating, and doing this and that?"
And you know what
I've been doing?
Prostituting.
- Mm-hmm.
- Prostituting.
Male prostituting.
- Well, let me tell you something.
- As a trans-female, because I get confused.
- Let me tell you something.
If you do that 'cause you need a buck or two-
- Not because I need a buck or two, because I have to have just one pull.
- Right.
Just don't go around telling welfare center about it.
- I have told them about it.
- Yeah, I know, well don't tell them anymore.
I'll tell them to forget it.
When a person tries as hard as he can, to do the best he can, and it doesn't work, he gets very upset and confused, and he thinks to himself,
"I must be all mixed up,
"there must be something wrong with me.
"I must be bad, even though I don't feel it."
Now the first couple of weeks are gonna be the hardest.
Because we gotta straighten out a few things.
After a couple of weeks those things will be straightened out, and there won't be much of a problem.
We're gonna try our best, if it's possible, to help you get the welfare.
I don't know anything about the rule about your being a minor, but we'll see what we can do about that.
We'll try to help you on that.
And meanwhile, you gotta work along with me on a couple of things.
We need some welfare assistance because clearly he's not in a position to work for himself, he's not organized enough.
I would say, roughly guessing, maybe about in a month he'll be ready.
If I send him off to the hospital, which I could easily do, he never will be ready.
And he'll be a public charge all the way.
This way we got at least a good chance of straightening him out so that he will be able to work.
There's a what?
He has no access to it.
He has no access to it.
Miss Hightower, I can't help what his mother does.
Miss Hightower, I don't wish to direct any conversation towards his mother.
I'm asking for the assistance of welfare.
This is an emergency situation.
I can possibly keep this man out of a hospital, if I get assistance.
You're telling me about the law, and the procedure, and my supposing to-
Uh, Miss Hightower, is this the welfare center?
Okay?
Are you concerned with your clients and the possibility of keeping them out of a hospital?
Why don't you answer?
Miss Hightower,
I as a psychiatrist,
I as a psychiatrist am...
All right.
Miss Hightower, I as a psychiatrist am asking your assistance of welfare, which you have in your hands, to help this person so that he has at least a chance of staying out of the hospital, and getting back to work.
Now this is exactly what I'm asking for.
Now can I get it?
I will put it in writing,
I certainly will.
I will send him back to that welfare center with that in writing.
I do not know at this time.
At this time, I do not know where he is staying.
He isn't sitting here in the room with me, and I don't know his address.
But I hope to get some assistance from welfare, and I hope not just to be faced with the fact that I'm supposed to go out and get his mother, who is not willing to help.
He does not have it.
He does not have it at his command, his mother is not willing to help him.
This is a considerable part of the problem, that his family has thrown him out because of his difficulties, and you're asking me to go out to get a person who won't even come in, and doesn't wish to help him, and making that conditional on your helping him.
Miss,
Miss Hightower.
I would be happy to speak to her.
This may well be her son, but she has not exhibited the interest up to now, and she has not been willing to give him the money, or do any help in taking care of him.
Miss Beevis.
This is an emergency situation.
The man is suffering from schizophrenia.
I am trying to help him.
Yes, he is suffering from schizophrenia.
I am trying to keep him out of the hospital.
If you put him through the procedure of sending him to his mother with a worker, you're gonna guarantee, that's right.
Now, now will he get the money regardless of what the worker finds at home?
This is what I wanna know.
I don't want to be put off and given the run around.
I wish an answer, and if you can't give it,
I wanna talk to somebody who can give it.
Miss Hightower, are you going to give him the assistance that
I'm asking for, regardless of what your worker finds out from the mother?
I'm asking that direct question.
I wish a commitment.
I don't wish you to tell me that you don't know what you're going to do.
She hung up on me.
- Come on, chief.
- Come on, my man.
- Can you walk now?
- Come on, wake up.
- Come on, get up, let's go.
- Come on, wake up.
- Come on.
- Let's go, stand up.
- Come on, that's it, hold on.
Come on, my man.
That's it.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
That's a boy.
- Stand up, come on, stand up.
Come on, man.
- Come on.
Turn around. - Turn around.
Don't you wanna sit down yet?
Hold on.
Hold on there.
Come on, turn around.
Turn around.
That's it, come on, turn around.
Come on, turn around.
That's it.
Wonderful.
That's it, now you got it.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
- Let's tie him to the chair.
What was it, wine or whiskey?
- I don't know.
- You don't remember?
Okay.
- Put your hands up.
Both hands up.
All right.
A young man like you, every day, you come in here raising hell, don't you?
Go up this way now, this way now.
Relax back forward.
Go back forward.
There's nothing wrong with that.
- Do you drink?
- Yeah.
I drink.
- Did you inject a needle?
- Yeah.
- When did you inject?
When did you inject?
Can you come over to the side?
- What do you think they gave you?
What did they give you?
- He told me it was mescaline, but I was chewing it and it tasted sort of funny.
Like soap or something like that.
- Uh-huh.
He told you it was mescaline, but it tasted funny.
- Yeah, I knew it wasn't.
- Lie down.
Okay.
Okay.
- I'm gonna die.
- You're not gonna die.
Can we have an NG tube, please?
And 10ccs of ipecac.
Make it 20.
No, no, no, no.
Just an NG tube.
How long ago did you take it?
- It was in the park, it was during the day.
I've been trying to puke it up or trying to shit it out, but it doesn't come out.
- Okay.
You're going to be all right.
You're going to be okay.
Lie down, all right.
Just lie down and relax.
You're going to be okay.
- What am I gonna do?
- You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.
All right.
There's no serious poison that you could've taken at 7:00.
- No, somebody in the park gave it to me.
Somebody in the park gave it to me.
- But if it was really serious, then it would've done you in by now.
- No, it was a pill, a pill!
- I understand, I understand.
Lie down and relax.
- It was a pill.
- I understand.
We need more.
Make it 20.
Okay, you're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.
I'm going to give you some medicine now that will counteract the pill, and you'll feel better.
Okay?
Just relax.
- Doc, can I call my friend Patricia?
Oh, I don't know, she's probably in the custom world by now.
Oh shit, I don't wanna die.
- You're not going to die.
You're not going to die.
Try to relax.
All right, now I want you to swallow this, okay?
- Okay, I will.
- I'm gonna loosen this, and I'd like you to swallow it.
I hope to be able to loosen this.
Okay, here you go.
Here you go.
Just relax.
Just relax.
Drink this.
All the way down.
Okay.
Little bit of water.
Drink, I want you to drink plenty of water now.
- I've got a pitcher.
- Good man, good man.
Easy does it, easy does it.
Just drink it down, good.
Just relax and drink it down.
- Drink the water.
- Try some more water.
Okay, okay.
It's too, it's fine, this is fine.
How you doing?
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die, it just all came up.
It all came up.
You're doing very well.
- What am I gonna do?
- You're going to be okay.
- I feel, I'm so lost.
- Okay, I want you to lie down.
You don't need any more water.
He's going to be okay.
That was excellent.
It all came up.
- Oh God.
- That was excellent.
- Do I need a psychiatrist?
- Yes, you do.
You're going to have one very shortly.
- All I want is this woman, a friend of mine.
I'm been writing her letters in Europe, but I haven't seen her in so many months.
- Okay.
Now you're going to be okay.
Let me just take your blood pressure in here before I send you down the hall, okay?
There's a psychiatrist down there who's waiting, and will talk to you very shortly.
- So did you take the poison out?
- We got the poison out.
You saw it come out.
- Oh.
What am I gonna do?
- the poison is out.
The poison is out.
- I don't wanna die.
- You will not die.
The poison is out.
- Doc, when I meant
I was feeling sick,
I feel like I've been malnutritioned or something.
- Right, right.
Well I would like you very much to discuss this with the psychiatrist, okay?
- Can you give me some tranquilizers then?
- He will.
- Maybe he gave me it, maybe it was a real trip he gave me.
Oh shit.
- Had you ever take mescaline before?
- Oh yes, but it was nothing like this.
I'm just so afraid now.
- Okay.
- I'm just so afraid of life now.
- Okay.
Come on, let's go down the hall.
Let's leave this with you.
Do we have a messenger?
Relax, relax.
We'll send you down the hall with a messenger to talk to a psychiatrist.
He's quite familiar with people with problems such as this, and he'll be able to help you out.
- I'm so afraid.
- That's all right, we're here.
- Don't be afraid, we're here.
- Here, lay back down.
- What am I, oh I'm so afraid.
- It's all right.
- Am I gonna die?
- No, you're not gonna die.
- I'm not gonna die?
- You're gonna talk to a psychiatrist, that's all.
Here lay back down.
- Wait, I don't wanna lie down,
I'm afraid if I do,
I'm gonna die here.
I'm waiting for a friend of mine.
Oh shit.
- There's a psychiatrist in code for him.
- You got a receipt?
- See, the doctor's coming now to see you.
Okay.
It's all right.
Just relax.
Just relax.
- I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
- Here, put this in your book.
- Okay, okay.
- That's all right.
Lay on the bed, Steve.
Lay down on the bed,
Steve, go ahead.
No, no, no!
I don't wanna die!
Please!
Oh shit.
Am I all right?
- Yeah, you're all right.
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
- I'm so sorry.
- Lie down on the bed.
Lie down on the bed.
- Wait.
I don't wanna lie down,
I'm afraid to lie down.
Can I just, can you play music or something?
- No, we're not allowed to play music in here.
- Anybody knows how to sing or something, or play music, I don't know.
Oh shit.
I think I should go back with my family.
- Where'd you come from?
- Minnesota.
- Minnesota?
- Yeah, it's pretty hard making it here on my own.
Trying to go to school, get an education.
I didn't know why I was getting an education in the beginning.
- Are you going to school now?
- Yeah.
Studying art.
But you can't do anything with art.
You can't do anything with anything in life, you know that?
Just get a job someplace, that's about it.
- Did you say a injury?
Well this is the room for injuries down here.
- Get an IV.
Let's just cut this.
Caesar?
Let's get him up on the table.
Let's get him up on the table.
Can you sit up?
120 over 70.
- Where was it?
- On 12th Street.
- On 12th Street?
- Whereabouts on 12th?
- Between Lenox and 5th.
- Between Lenox and 5th?
- Yeah.
- Did you get it in there?
- Yeah.
- Let it go full speed.
- George?
Do you know the guys that did it?
- Don't move, don't move George.
- Put your hand right here.
Can you move the line over here?
- Mm-hmm, sure.
- Yeah, but he's gonna be all right.
- Along this way?
- He's cut right along this side.
It wasn't, good thing it wasn't any deeper,
'cause if it was any deeper he would've been in serious trouble.
It would've cut a major blood vessel, and he would've bled a lot.
But the wound was superficial and it just cut a lot of superficial blood vessels along the side of the neck.
It looked like a lot of bleeding, but it wasn't really all that bad.
He's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna have him x-rayed now, and we're gonna give him a lot of fluid.
He's gonna stay for a couple of days, and we're gonna check him very closely.
So you stay with him for a few minutes, we're gonna get the x-ray carts, then you can see him on the ward.
He'll probably be going to sleep soon, then you'd better go home.
You can come back and see him tomorrow.
- You losing weight?
- I done lost some 30 something pounds underweight.
- But have you lost a lot in the last month?
- Yeah.
- Huh, yeah?
- Lost some weight.
- All right, look up here.
I wanna look in your eyes.
Open your mouth, sir.
Can you open any further than that?
Stick your tongue out.
Stick it out.
And open.
I gotta see in there now.
All right.
All right, relax your tongue.
Let your tongue relax.
Relax now.
Relax.
Open, open.
Open up.
Open up for me.
Can you open your mouth?
Say what?
- My jaw was broken.
You know, it's hollow down there.
- Yeah.
Now take your shirt off.
- We're gonna take her back, then I'm gonna remake the paperwork, then the doc's gonna see her again, that's all I know.
- Yeah, that don't make sense running the patient all over the place.
It really don't.
All of them sit here all these hours, three and four hours at a time.
- Right, and he said when Dr.
Bedman called, he said they didn't have no bed for the patient.
- That don't make sense.
That lady been for three or four hours, she's been riding from one hospital to the other.
And it don't make sense.
It don't make sense.
Now we take her down there, then somewhere else.
She might have to wind up coming back up here.
That's what happens,
- I guess that's what happens when you don't have no money.
You have to take what comes.
- That's right.
If she had money, she'd have stayed at a private hospital.
Wouldn't be running all over the place.
What about her relatives, there's nobody there?
No relatives?
That's another bad thing too.
She don't have no relatives.
Well, take it easy.
- Okay, where's the nurse, I need her help.
Nurse?
Nurse?
Morphine please, and 15 miligrams.
- She's pulmonary edema.
- You wanna get another IV going?
- IPPB.
Get me IPPB here.
We gotta give her IPPB, John.
She's in edema.
She got a good pulse?
- Yes, she has been taking medication.
- For high blood pressure?
- Yes.
- Has she been taking it?
- I have no idea, I don't live with her.
- I'm just trying to find out some information.
- I don't know.
She has been taking for high blood pressure.
She lives alone.
I have no idea.
- I see.
- But she was over for my birthday.
We were having quite a few drinks, had a very nice birthday party.
Ma came from Connecticut.
The only thing I'm interested in is, what is her condition?
- Right now?
- Right now.
- Her condition is grave.
Critical.
- It is critical?
- Yeah.
- That's what I wanted to know.
- Yeah, but I need to find out everything I can from you about her.
- That I can tell you.
- Is she a diabetic?
- No, she's not a diabetic.
- Has she had frequent pnuemonias?
- No, nothing, no, no.
- No.
But she had the slight stroke, when was that?
- Couple of years ago.
- Was it on the left or the right side?
- I don't know.
- Which hand was she having trouble with, the left or the right hand?
- Good Lord, you're asking me questions that are-
- It's important.
- Maybe right.
I couldn't possibly say.
- She's never had any trouble talking after the stroke?
- Never.
- All right.
And has she been under anybody's care?
- Yeah, she's been under a doctor's care.
- Do you know the doctor?
- Yeah.
- Do you have his name and address?
- Yes, I certainly do.
Are these x-rays?
- Not for her.
- I'm so upset, I don't even...
Is she all right?
- She's not all right, no.
- She is critical.
- Yeah.
- I'm upset.
- I don't blame you.
- Oh stamps, don't worry about the stamps.
Here.
- Beg pardon?
- I'll keep this.
- Well what number do
I have on the back?
- Surprise Coffee Shop.
- No.
- Ma?
Ma, don't worry.
Ma?
- Excuse me, was she ever here before as a patient?
- No, I don't believe so.
Mom?
- Well I guess just whatever in the way of history.
If there's anything, you know, that's pertinent that happened down here especially.
- Mr. Fields, I have to get back to work.
- I'm real sick.
- I understand your problem.
I understand your problem, and you, there's no question about it, that you're too old to live alone, and to take care of yourself alone.
The social worker on 7th Avenue is trying to find a place for you to stay.
The social worker here will try to find a place for you to stay.
But the hospital is not the place now.
But in the same house, know what happened?
Last week, they shot an old man in the same hallway.
The same place.
- I know.
- Huh?
- I know.
- I know.
I know it's not simple, but you're not the only one in this position, and there are many, many people every day, who are placed into appropriate nursing homes.
And if you just call the number tomorrow, the lady will take care of you.
It may not happen the next day, it may take her a few weeks to do, but they will take care, and you can get glasses tomorrow for sure.
- For sure.
- Yes.
- Okay.
You definitely should have glasses.
- Today especially, we confront the mystery of God.
We approach Him, forgetting ourselves, we approach Him, reverently, with awe, with wonder, realizing inevitably at the same time, our own insufficiency before Him, our littleness, indeed, our nothingness before our God.
For who of us humans could ever know the mind of God?
Who of us could ever give advice to Him?
Who of us could ever give Him anything that He has not already?
Or lend Him anything that He would need?
For everything that exists comes from Him.
Everything is by Him, everything is for Him, to Him give glory forever.
Hallelujah.
Today I think we want a more selfless attitude.
More in the spirit of the glory of the mass which we recited earlier in the mass.
In which the whole sentiment is all praise to God.
Nevermind me.
Glory to God in the highest.
We praise you, we worship you, we glorify you.
Or in other words, perhaps, as Bishop Fulton Sheen once expressed it,
"Today, let us thank
God for God." in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
The year is 1929. The singer,
Cliff Edwards, also known as Ukulele Ike.
The film, Hollywood Revue.
It is the first all-talking...
...all-singing, all-dancing movie ever made.
Everyone from the place
Come on with your rain
I've got a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
In the years that followed,
"Singin' in the Rain" would become...
...a theme song for MGM.
Singin' in the rain
In the 1930s, Jimmy Durante gave us this rendition.
You wrote that this morning?
Yeah, it's something they'll remember.
Yeah, I remember it already.
I'm singin' in the rain
Oh, I'm singin' in the rain
What a grand, what a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
In the 1940s, Judy Garland did it her way.
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
I'm gettin' ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
And come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singin'
Singin'
I'm singin' in the rain
In the 1950s, Gene Kelly,
Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor...
...put it all together in what many folks would call the best musical ever made.
Singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin'
We're happy again
If you're wondering what happened in between, well...
...sit back and relax.
You're about to find out.
It's been quite some time since I first came to this place.
And MGM is certainly not the same studio...
...and Hollywood's not the same town.
But the films we made here are still around.
Some studios can claim they made the finest gangster films...
...or the greatest horror movies...
...but when it came to musicals,
MGM, they were the champions.
Musicals were fantasy trips for the audiences of their day.
For instance, boy meets girl, boy loses girl...
...boy sings a song and gets girl.
The plots were that simple.
The musicals of the 1930s, '40s, or even the '50s...
...may not tell you where our heads were at...
...but they tell you where our hearts were at.
And all of this lovable nonsense began back in 1929...
...when the silent film had suddenly become a thing of the past...
...and sound was the king.
Don't bring a frown to old Broadway
You've gotta clown on Broadway
Broadway Melody of 1929 won an Oscar for the Best Picture that year...
...and MGM was off and running with a new formula for success.
Charles King and a line of slightly overweight chorus girls...
...were the beginning of a new motion picture art form...
...that would captivate audiences for years to come.
No skies of gray
On the Great White Way
That's the Broadway Melody!
No skies of gray
On the Great White Way
That's the Broadway Melody!
Within a few short years, the musical had come of age.
The primitive stage show had now become a cinematic spectacular.
Here Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger,
Nelson Eddy and a cast of thousands...
...watched Eleanor Powell dance in Rosalie.
When I'm calling you
The most successful singing team in the history of motion pictures...
...Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in Rose-Marie.
Will you answer too?
- Then I will know
- Then I will know
- Our love
- Our love
- Will come true
- Will come true
- You'll belong to me
- You'll belong to me
- I'll belong
- I'll belong
- To you
- To you
In 1936, The Great Ziegfeld won an Oscar for Best Picture that year...
...and it's no wonder.
Virginia Bruce and a gang of lovely ladies...
...cluttered up
Hollywood's biggest staircase.
And somewhere in that lovely mob, you'll find Dennis Morgan singing a song.
If anyone could afford to film this extravagant number today...
...perhaps it would look something like this.
Just like a heavenly rhapsody
She captures you right from the start
Just like a beautiful melody
She'll play on the strings of your heart
A pretty girl
Is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain
Of a haunting refrain
She'll start upon a marathon
And run around your brain
You can't escape
She's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you
And then
- Come back again
- Will come back
A pretty girl
Is just like a pretty
Tune
She's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you
And then
Come back again
A pretty girl
Is just like a pretty tune
The last of the big black-and-white production numbers...
...starring Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire.
Cole Porter's music, the sets and the camera work...
...the direction by Norman Taurog, the incredible tap dancing by these two...
...well, it all seemed to come together in Broadway Melody of 1940.
You know, you can wait around and hope, but I'll tell you...
...you'll never see the likes of this again.
Don't be afraid
You'll make the grade
Why, you can sing
As good as Bing
And here, the old pro,
James Durante, gives a newcomer...
...a few pointers in It Happened in Brooklyn.
Sing it, Danny, make me proud.
Okay, Nick, stand back.
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Smile.
Long as it comes from the heart
Keep going.
It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Great.
Long as it comes from the heart
I'll give 'em that
I'll give 'em this
I'll strut away
Boy! You can't miss!
Just put a star on my chart
You won't need this anymore.
'Cause the song's gonna come
From the heart
Don't work cheap.
- On opening nights
- On opening nights
- Your name in lights
- Your name in lights
Why we won't stop
'Til you reach the top
- We'll order our meal à la carte
- We'll order our meal à la carte
- That's expensive!
- That's expensive!
- If the song comes from the heart
- If the song comes from the heart
We'll be tremendous!
- If the song comes from the heart
- If the song comes from the heart
They'll holler, "Bravo. "
- If the song
- If the song
- Comes from the heart
- Comes from the heart
- Heart
- Heart
That's just a sample of what's been going on around here for the past 40 years.
The work was hard, but it was great fun.
Because the people you worked with really knew what they were doing.
It was said that through those doors passed the most famous stars in Hollywood.
I don't think you'll find anyone around this town who will argue about it.
Here's one of the most lovely and talented of those stars...
...Miss Elizabeth Taylor.
I was 10 years old when I first came to MGM.
And I spent most of the next 18 years of my life...
...behind the walls of that studio.
As a young girl growing up in that strange place...
...it's hard to recall what was real and what wasn't.
Perhaps, my most vivid memories were of MGM musicals.
Just to stand there on the set and watch...
...the singing and the dancing.
It was like fantasy come true.
Total innocence. Loveliness.
I love a melody
Of spring
Lilacs in bloom
Birds on the wing
I made my musical debut when I was 15 years old...
...in a film called Cynthia.
I was certainly no threat to Jane Powell or Judy Garland...
...as you will see.
For life is an eager
Joyous thing
Whenever I hear
The music
Of
Spring
Maybe that experience helped give me...
...the enormous regard that I have for musical talent.
And believe me, at MGM, I saw the best.
HORNE
Every honeybee sighs with jealousy
For instance, if Lena Horne was in a movie...
...then it almost had to be from MGM.
Honeysuckle rose
When we're passin' by
Flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter
Goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweet when you stir it up
When I'm takin' sips
From your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips
You're confection
Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
- 'Cause it's one
- Two
- Three strikes, you're out
- Three strikes, you're out
- At the old ball game
- At the old ball game
When Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly teamed up for a series of films...
...the results were irresistible.
This is one of their best,
Take Me Out to the Ball Game.
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty?
Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me
Hear me holler
I choose a sweet lollapalooza in thee
June Allyson, MGM's most popular musical sweetheart...
...in Rodgers and Hart's Words and Music.
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
And thou swell
Thou witty, thou grand
Everybody's favorite college musical...
...Good News, starring June Allyson and Peter Lawford.
Those sure were the good old days.
The boy, "garçon"
His girl, "la fille"
That's good, "c'est bon"
The show, "fini"
The moral to this tale
Is not just "parlez-vous"
Send her a billet-doux
Tell her her eyes are blue
They sure are blue.
"Je vous adore" means
I love you
What wonderful years those were at MGM.
One day, I remember meeting a terribly handsome young man from England.
He'd just started work at the studio.
Naturally, I fell wildly in love with him.
I still adore him.
He's still one of my closest and dearest friends.
Peter Lawford.
This building, or what's left of it...
...was, among other things,
Tait College in Good News.
You might say that June Allyson,
Mel Tormé and I graduated from here.
We were all under contract to MGM in those days.
And the studio pretty much told us what pictures we were gonna appear in.
They put us in dramas, comedies and in my case...
...don't ask me why, an occasional musical.
As a singer or dancer, I was ill-equipped to compete with Astaire or Kelly...
...but we did what we were told to do.
When I first came to MGM, the world was at war.
To the Gls overseas and the audiences here at home...
...the musicals were a very special kind of escape...
...both during the war and sfterwards.
The films we made here had a certain style...
...a look that was unmistakable.
Whether it was the directing, or the writing, or the scenery...
...the costumes, the lighting,
I don't really know.
But somehow you could always tell that it was an MGM movie.
Especially the musicals.
All right, cut it.
- Print it, Jane.
- Okay.
All right, take me into number one.
Okay, number one.
Can you see your marks, Joe?
Okay, everybody.
- Quiet! We're rolling.
Speed. Action.
The studio was constantly experimenting...
...constantly showcasing new talent.
For instance, Debbie Reynolds and Carleton
Carpenter in Two Weeks with Love.
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a
Said the chimpy to the monk
Said the monkey to the chimp
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they were happy and gay
Swinging and singing
In a honky-tonky way
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a
Means, "Monk, I love but you"
"Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a" in monkey talk
Means, "Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon
They went upon their
Aba daba honeymoon
Elizabeth Taylor starred in A Date With Judy...
...one of the first in a new wave of teenage musicals...
...most of them produced by Joe Pasternak.
That isn't Elizabeth's voice you're hearing.
MGM kept her too busy to rehearse and record.
But her costar, Jane Powell, quickly became one of the studio's...
...most popular young talents.
As an old
Native-born
Californian would say
It's a most unusual day
There are people greeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
Here she comes!
Hey, Jim, you better get the rig
She's got a list of passengers
That's pretty big
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots of them been travelin'
For quite a spell
All the way to California
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe
The Harvey Girls, directed by George Sidney...
...starred Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.
And this Oscar-winning song was written by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.
In this day and age
Girls don't leave home
But if ya get a hankerin'
You wanna roam
Our advice to you is run away
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the
Santa Fe
All aboard!
We came across the country lickety-split
Rolling 90 miles an hour, fit to be tied
I can't believe I'm here at last
When you go traveling
It's natch for you
To take the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe
I can't believe that anything
Would go so fast
Then you pull that throttle
Whistle blows
A- huffin' and a-puffin'
And away she goes
All aboard for California
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison, Topeka
- On the Atchison, Topeka
- On the Atchison, Topeka and
- On the Atchison, Topeka and
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the
Santa Fe
By the 1950s, the movie musical was reaching a level...
...of inventiveness and sophistication that was pretty hard to top...
...even by today's standards.
But it wasn't always like that.
And here's someone to tell you about it.
And he's pretty hard to top too.
Mr. James Stewart.
In the late 1920s and early '30s...
...these 200 acres of real estate were seeing a panic, pandemonium.
Sound pictures had replaced silent films virtually overnight.
The only actor in town that wasn't worried was Rin Tin Tin.
As long as he could bark, well, sound was no threat to him.
For MGM and the rest of Hollywood...
...there were gloomy days ahead.
Some of the biggest silent stars spoke with thick foreign accents.
Others had a lisp or talked through their noses.
The early microphones seemed to exaggerate the flaws...
...that silent film had hidden.
As quickly as the sound stages went up, careers collapsed.
The studio heads were desperate.
Where would the new stars, the new personalities come from, they wondered.
Well, the answer was obvious.
From the theater, from Broadway.
Theatrical experience suddenly became a passport to Hollywood...
...even if it meant no more than a few weeks of summer stock.
Over the next few years, a steady stream of hopefuls...
...marched through the gates of every studio in town, including MGM.
I should know, I was one of those hungry young actors from the East.
- Sam, is everything all right?
- Okay, Fred.
- How are the cameras?
- All right.
Bob, how are your lights?
All set, whenever you are.
Good. How's the music...?
Musicals were the most popular commodity in the early '30s.
And they were cranked out at an incredible rate.
Most of them really weren't very good.
But if audiences suffered, they didn't complain.
The real victims were the dramatic actors.
The studio pushed nearly every one of them into musical roles.
It must be you
Who carries me away
Here, an uncomfortable
Robert Montgomery tries his best.
But when you're near
The music in my soul
Would fade each time we part
Bob Montgomery was only one of many MGM contract players...
...forced to sing and dance.
In the frantic search for musical stars, many would be called...
...but few would succeed.
Here's one of my favorites.
And I know you all like her too.
Because she's the personification of youth...
...and beauty and joy and happiness,
Joan Crawford.
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody
Much as I love you?
Huh, did you?
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody
How about me too, huh?
Oh, my
You're the one I crave
I could be your slave
Honey, let me rave
Got a feelin' for you
Crazy about your smile
Hey, an easy style
Got it all the time
Got a feelin' for you
Like your turned-up nose
Like your knees down low
From your head to toe
Got a feelin' for you
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody
Much as I love you?
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody
Could you love me too?
You're the one I crave
I could be your slave
Honey, let me say
Got a feelin' for you
What'll you ever be?
What'll you ever do?
How'll you ever know
If you don't take a chance?
Jean Harlow, the blonde bombshell...
...tried out her musical abilities in Reckless.
I wanna live, love, learn a lot
I'll light my candle
And I'll burn a lot
You'll have some bad shots
Hard knocks
I'm on my own if I bruise
And there'll be smiles here
Shouts here
And I can take it on the chin if I lose
Because I'm reckless
Because she's reckless
Reckless
Because I'm reckless
I'm gonna go places
And look life in the face
Hey.
Did I remember
Jean Harlow's musical talents were somewhat limited...
...and the studio usually used someone else's voice for her vocals.
But in a movie called Suzy, her costar,
Cary Grant, did his own singing.
And darn well too.
How do you know?
You didn't hear it.
I assure you I heard every word.
Let me convince you.
Sit down. Gentlemen, play it again.
You be the audience.
Did I remember to tell you you're delightful?
You're everything I want you to be.
Your eyes look lovely
And far beyond comparing
Especially when they're glaring
At me
I can't think up words to say
How swell you are
But I can tell you are
I know so well you are
I started falling
The moment that I saw you
Believe me, I adore you
Chérie
I'm sure you'll hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For you'd be
So easy to love
I was lucky enough to sing a Cole Porter song...
...in Born to Dance with Eleanor Powell.
At first, the studio planned to have someone else record the vocal.
But the tune became such a big hit that they decided to let me do it.
You see...
...they figured the song was so good that even my singing couldn't hurt it.
We'd be so grand
At the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be, oh
So easy to love
I know that you'll join us in giving a really rousing, rip-roaring reception...
...to Harry Van and Les Blondes. Mr. Van.
Norma Shearer and Edward
Arnold looked on as Clark Gable...
...made his musical debut in Idiot's Delight.
Hello, people, and thanks a lot for that very lovely reception.
Thanks a million, and I won't settle for a cent less.
In our modest act tonight, we'll be ably assisted...
...by Professor Palova and his talented team. Give them a hand, folks.
Okey-dokey, fellas. Take it away.
- This will be amusing, Achille.
- I hope so.
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to
Why don't you go
Where Harlem sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled gowns upon the bevy
Of highbrows
But down the levee
All misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz
That's where each and every
Lulu Belle goes
Every Thursday evening
With her swell beaus
Rubbing elbows
Come with me and we'll attend
The jubilee
And see them spend
Their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Clark Gable surprised everyone with his delightfully corny routine.
And yet, his fans were just outraged...
...to see him even try singing and dancing.
Their hero was above such nonsense.
But it was perfectly all right for a youngster named Judy Garland...
...to dedicate a song to their idol.
Dear Mr. Gable
I am writing this to you
And I hope that you will read it
So you'll know
My heart beats like a hammer
And I stutter and I stammer
Every time I see you
At the picture show
I guess I'm just another fan of yours
And I thought I'd write
And tell you so
You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, sir
You made me feel so sad
You made me sigh 'cause
I didn't wanna tell you
I think you're grand
That's true
Yes, I do, 'deed I do
You know I do
I don't care what happens
Let the whole world stop
As far as I'm concerned
You'll always be the top
'Cause you know
You made me
Love you
"Dear Mr. Gable" was a milestone in its day.
It was the first time a studio permitted a song to be dedicated to one of its stars.
And it was sung by a little girl...
...who would soon become
MGM's newest star.
And here's someone who can tell you more about that remarkable talent.
He's a remarkable talent himself.
Mickey Rooney.
This is Carvel Street.
For anyone who's ever seen an Andy Hardy movie...
...well, this is where they were all shot, right here.
Over there, that was
Polly Benedict's home across the street.
And this was the home of the Hardy family.
The picket fence is gone, and the mailbox too...
...but it's still the Hardy home.
It might seem strange that a person could spend over 20 years...
...growing up on the same movie set.
But in a way, that's what happened to me.
I was about 10 years old when I first came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer...
...and I was raring to go.
The movie was Broadway to Hollywood.
And you guessed it, it was a musical.
Well, we... We all change a little over the years, don't we?
You know, when you've been raised at a studio, the way I was...
...you learn a certain ability that time can't seem to erase.
You learn to recognize real talent.
You see so many people come and go...
...that when an exceptional talent comes along...
...it seems to stick out like a sore thumb.
I was a seasoned veteran of 17 when I first had the opportunity...
...of working with the great and wonderful Judy Garland.
I knew when I saw her standing before the camera...
...that she had that certain magic.
Her talent seemed to jump right off the screen at you.
Do re mi fa so la ti do
Judy and I became close friends when we did a series of films together...
...that the studio called
"backyard musicals. "
Audiences seemed to love the pictures...
...even though the plots were suspiciously alike.
Only our names seemed to change.
How do you do?
Good morning. I'm Betsy Booth.
- I sing, you know.
- I know, I heard you.
You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?
This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.
Danny, this is my grandchild,
Ms. Ginger Gray.
- Yes, we've met.
- This is my cousin, Ms. Polly Williams.
Mr. Daniel Churchill, a junior.
Ms. Barton, this is Ms. Essex, the once famous "Baby Rosalie. "
How do you do? This is Mickey Moran.
How do you do?
My name's Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?
- I don't think I like you.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- I want success.
- And you'll have it.
I know you will, Mickey. Just think when our names are up in electric lights.
You the big composer and producer, and me the singing star.
We could have our own great modern dance orchestra.
We've got everything we need here.
We've got the brass...
...the piano and the reeds.
We can make our own arrangements, specialties and play for all the dances.
We've gotta have a great show with a million laughs.
And color, a lot of lights to make it sparkle.
And songs, wonderful songs with you out there selling them.
It'll be wonderful.
Say, that's not a bad idea.
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.
Why, it looks as if you'll need a whole city block.
Yeah. Sure, that's it.
Right in the neighborhood, and everybody'll come to it.
A Western rodeo, once a year we'll bring back the West.
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James, Buffalo Bill.
- A hundred beautiful girls.
- On horseback.
- Glorious costumes, happy, carefree.
- Gay!
I'm gonna write a show for us right here in Seaport.
It'd be the most up-to-date thing these hicks around here have seen.
Opening night, we'll have
Max Gordon and Sam Harris...
...down to give us the once-over.
How about it, kids?
- They call us babes in arms
- We never dance
- They think they must direct us
- But no chance
- But if we're babes in arms
- High romance
- We'll make them all respect us
- Why, oh, why
Why have we got our arms
What have we got our sight for?
Play day is done
We've a place in the sun
We must fight for
When our movies took off at the box office...
...we found our budgets taking off too.
So they moved Judy and I out of the backyard and into the barn...
...then to the high school gym...
...and later to a Broadway stage that would never have fit in a real theater.
Where we got all that energy,
I'll never know.
But a lot of it was inspired by our director, a genius...
...Busby Berkeley.
Small town
Living in a small town
When you're in a small town
You gotta make friends
- One, two, three
- One, two, three
Watch them shuffling along
See them shuffling along
Go take your best gal
Your real pal
Go down on the levee
I said to the levee
And we'll join that shuffling throng
Hear that music and song
It's simply great, mate
Waitin' on the levee
Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee
We're babes on Broadway
We're goin' places
When our new faces appear
It's a wonderful street
For babes like us to be on
We're here because
We want our names in neon
We left Topeka
We left Eureka
And came to seek a career
Oh, we're milkin' applause
Instead of milkin' a cow
'Cause we're babes on Broadway now
With our flag unfurled
We can face the world
Hey, leader
Strike up the band
There's another fellow who worked on this lot with Judy...
...and some of MGM's best musicals...
...are a direct result of his considerable talents.
Gene Kelly.
This is MGM's New York street.
And for as long as I can remember...
...this has been the busiest standing set on the whole backlot.
Any actor or actress...
...who made more than one or two films at this studio...
...sooner or later probably would find himself shooting a sequence here.
Which reminds me, if you're a song-and-dance man...
...and you've spent some time in pictures...
...inevitably, some interviewer will ask:
"Who was your favorite dancing partner?
Was it Rita Hayworth, or Vera-Ellen, or Leslie Caron?"
But if you're smart, you'll never give them a straight answer.
I'm gonna break that rule right now.
It may not be gallant...
...but I'd like to show you the greatest partner I've ever danced with.
When you dance with Fred Astaire, you really have to be on your toes.
This number from Ziegfeld Follies...
...was the only time we've had a chance to work together.
But I'd change my name to Ginger if we could do it again.
Fred Astaire has been the tops...
...in every field of show business he ever entered.
And the motion-picture musical owes him a great deal.
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no
They can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no
They can't take that away from me
When he starred in a series of musicals with Ginger Rogers...
...they quickly became the most popular dance team...
...in the history of motion pictures.
But for Fred, as an individual...
...it was only the beginning of a screen career...
...that would delight several generations of moviegoers.
Stand up and sing
We've got the gang together
We always sang together
Stand up and sing
Over the years,
Fred Astaire's trademark would become...
...the top hat and tails.
He wore the outfit in his very first film appearance...
...Dancing Lady with Joan Crawford.
I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized
There'd be another man
Jack Buchanan, the debonair British musical star...
...joined Fred in The Band Wagon.
Until the big affair began
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf
And that was that
I tried to reach the moon
But when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I've lost the one girl I'd found
But besides elegance, there's a lot more to the Astaire style.
Fred was constantly striving for perfection.
Rehearsing hour sfter hour...
...searching for a new step or a new device...
...that would bring something fresh to each of his numbers.
Because of his ingenuity and precision...
...audiences never realized how much incredible effort...
...Fred poured into his work.
He made it all appear so easy.
In Royal Wedding,
Fred danced with a hat rack.
And as usual, he made his partner look good.
In The Barkleys of Broadway...
...Fred and choreographer Hermes Pan...
...conceived the brilliant
"Shoes With Wings On" number.
Fred and director Stanley Donen...
...collaborated on this mind-boggling routine from Royal Wedding.
Movie buffs are still arguing about how it was done.
The gimmicks Fred used were exciting and fun.
But his talents were so extraordinary...
...that he could easily get along without them.
This is the Astaire I love to watch.
With a lovely partner like Cyd Charisse...
...a simple settiing...
...a marvelous song by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz...
...these are the only ingredients
Fred would need...
...to create a classic moment.
"Dancing in the Dark" from The Band Wagon.
Fred Astaire was and is a unique talent.
There'll never be another like him...
...and that's what I love about our profession.
Because every so often an artist comes along...
...who's impossible to compare with anyone else.
Here's another of my favorite dancing partners...
...Donald O'Connor.
MGM seemed to acquire talent the way you and I pick up paper clips...
...by the handful.
When I was at the studio...
...we were up to our ears in tenors, baritones, tap dancers, pianists...
...and they were all good.
But this set belonged pretty much to one star...
...and one star alone.
I only wish we'd had a chance to work together.
Well, she was not only a lovely actress, with a beautiful face and figure...
...but she could also sing and dance, and even handle comedy.
And if that wasn't enough, she was dynamite in the water.
Of course I'm talking about
Ms. Esther Williams.
A champion swimmer...
...Esther was working as a model in a Los Angeles department store...
...when MGM talent scouts discovered her.
The studio built a special swimming pool for her on the backlot...
...and starred her in a film called
Bathing Beauty.
The rest is history.
MGM featured Esther in a series of spectacular productions.
During her career, she swam...
...opposite some of MGM's most popular leading men.
Some of them even got their hair wet.
Like Howard Keel...
...Fernando Lamas, whom she would later marry...
...Van Johnson...
...Peter Lawford...
...Ricardo Montalban...
...even Tom and Jerry.
Jimmy Durante...
...and Red Skelton.
As her fame grew...
...so did the size and population of her swimming pools.
Esther no longer could simply climb up a diving board and jump in.
Now, she had to be presented like Venus...
...rising from the sea.
In the ranks of great musical stars, there have been singers, dancers...
...musicians, even ice skaters.
But MGM saw to it there was only one Esther Williams.
Eat your heart out, Mark Spitz.
People say that performers are overly affectionate with one another.
And that may be true.
I don't have to apologize for the way I feel...
...about a young lady that I worked with here at MGM.
I love her.
And she's as big a hit right now on Broadway...
...as she was here in Hollywood.
She never stops.
Miss Debbie Reynolds.
I made my first movie for MGM back in 1950.
Remember Three Little Words?
Hey, fellas, can we borrow your piano just a minute?
Of course, the real stars were
Fred Astaire and Red Skelton...
...but see that funny-looking kid coming down the steps?
Look out, Hollywood. Here I come.
I wanna be loved by you alone
Boop-boop-bee-doo
I wanna be loved by you
Just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone
Carleton Carpenter and I only did this one number in the picture.
But it certainly helped our careers.
Even though the voice wasn't mine...
...MGM brought in the song's originator,
Helen Kane, to sing the vocal.
And make you my own
Bap-bap-bee-dap
Boop-boop-ba-doo
I wanna be loved by you
Just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Bap-bap-bee-dap-bee-dap-bee-dap
Boop-boop-ba-doo
When I first reported at the studio...
...MGM was celebrating its 25th anniversary.
They had converted the biggest sound stage on the lot into a restaurant.
They only served one meal, but it was a lunch that old-timers still talk about.
The studio used to boast that it had more stars than there are in the heavens.
And that day, they weren't kidding.
The first time I met the king,
Clark Gable...
...he looked down at me and said,
"Hello, beautiful. "
And I nearly fainted.
This place was the land of giants, and I was a small fry.
But like any other young hopeful,
I was determined...
...that somehow and someday
I'd measure up.
In the early 1950s...
...MGM was entering a new era of motion pictures...
...with more star power...
...than virtually every other studio in Hollywood combined.
I've gotta hear that beat
I've gotta hear those drums
And even when it comes to romance
When I feel that I might fall
I always stall and play it smart
Till I hear that beat
I've gotta hear that beat
That certain beat in my heart
Ann Miller, the best tap-dancing lady on the lot.
Annie's talents and Busby Berkeley's imaginative direction...
...were a perfect combination in Small Town Girl.
Be my love
For no one else can...
A truck driver from Philadelphia became the most sensational new voice...
...in motion pictures.
Mario Lanza. He made only a few films.
And The Toast of New Orleans with Kathryn Grayson was one of his best.
Just fill my arms
The way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire
With every sweet desire
Be my love
And with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand
We'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me
Eternally
If you will be
My love
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Everyone wants to laugh
Donald O'Connor in Singin' in the Rain...
...in my opinion, the funniest musical number ever done.
They'll be standin' in lines
For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines
Or you could study Shakespeare
And be quite elite
And you can charm the critics
And have nothin' to eat
Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Everyone wants to laugh
My grandpa said
Go out and tell 'em a joke
But give it plenty of hoke
Make 'em roar, make 'em scream
Take a fall, butt a wall, split a seam
You start off by pretending
You're a dancer with grace
You wiggle 'till they're giggling
All over the place
And then you get a great big
Custard pie in the face
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you... All the...
My dad...
They'll be standing in lines

The showboat's coming.
Come on, mule. Git.
Show Boat, one of the best musical films MGM ever made.
It starred Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel,
Marge and Gower Champion...
...Joe E. Brown, William Warfield and Ava Gardner.
See the showboat
That's old Captain Andy's
Cotton Blossom
Will you go?
Are you coming to the show?
'Twill be delightful
Right, right, rightfully they say
There's not another show
Don't you want to see the show?
Captain Andy has gathered a troupe in the
Greatest of dramas and jolly comedies
Stephen Baker
The handsomest leading man
And beautiful Julie LaVerne as well
Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom
Captain Andy's floating show
Thrills and laughter, concert sfter
Everybody's sure to go
Leave the lumber in the sawmill
Leave the cotton on the stalk
Make believe
Our lips are blending
In a phantom kiss
Or two or three
Might as well make believe
I love you
For to tell the truth
I do
Ol' man tiver
That ol' man river
He must know somethin'
But don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin'
Along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
You get a little drunk
And you land in
Jail
I gets weary
And sick of trying
I'm tired of living
And scared of dying
But ol' man river
He just keeps rolling
Along
I'll go my way by myself
Like a bird on the wing
I remember something else
I learned at the studio...
...during my stay there. MGM's motto:
"Do it big, do it right, and give it class. "
I'd like you to meet someone who certainly measures up to that phrase.
He's the classiest gentleman
I've ever worked with.
Mr. Fred Astaire.
I'm by myself
Alone
I have a great many fond memories about this place.
So many happy moments worrying about whether or not...
...we were getting the job done.
What fun.
We shot some of The Band Wagon here.
Being here again brings to mind some of the wonderful people...
...I've worked with over the years.
One of them in particular...
...is my long-time friend...
...Gene Kelly.
In The Pirate with the Nicholas Brothers...
...Gene displayed the rough-and-tumble kind of acrobatic dancing...
...that quickly became a popular part of his repertoire.
From the start,
Gene was constantly experimenting...
...from classical ballet to a burlesque buck-and-wing.
He was determined to broaden the horizons of the film musical.
And in doing so, he became one of the most versatile...
...and original performers the movies have ever known.
Kelly was forever breaking rules.
Though the studio often tried to stop him...
...Gene insisted on doing his own stunts.
His bosses always seemed to find out about it sfter the scene had been shot.
But audiences loved the sight of Gene himself...
...flying through the air in film sfter film.
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
In On the Town with Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin...
...Manhattan became the backdrop for this unforgettable romp.
A tribute to Gene's persistence...
...it was the first major musical to be filmed on location.
The famous places to visit are so many
Or so the guidebooks say
I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any
But we got just one day
Gotta see the whole town
Right from Yonkers on down to the bay
In just one day
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
Manhattan women are all in silk and satin
Or so the fellas say
There's just one thing necessary
In Manhattan
When you got just one day
Gotta pick up a date, maybe seven or eight
On your way
In just one day
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
I've had a lot of partners in my day.
But can you imagine a grown man dancing with a mouse?
Well, Gene did just that in Anchors Aweigh.
His dancing partner was Jerry the Mouse of Tom and Jerry fame.
Critics said it was the most effective use of live and animation technique...
...ever put on film.
And I certainly agree.
Look at me. I'm dancing.
More than any other star, I think
Gene Kelly became the symbol...
...of the MGM musical of the 1950s.
And here's a classic routine that audiences would never forget.
This is my favorite number from one of his very best musicals...
...Singin' in the Rain.
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin'
Singin' in the rain
Dancin' in the rain
I'm happy again
I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain
I'm dancin' and singin'
In the rain
The finale to the Broadway ballet from Singin' in the Rain...
...seems to me to exemplify the genius of Gene Kelly.
Actor, singer, dancer, choreographer and director.
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
That's the Broadway
Melody
You've seen Gene Kelly's work on the screen.
I think I've said it all.
He's one of those rare talents who really understands...
...what the movie musical is all about.
Now I'd like you to meet someone that recently joined the gang.
If Hollywood breeding could be compared to royalty...
...then she would certainly be our crown princess.
I remember so well when she, as a tiny little girl...
...used to sit on the set watching her father, Vincente Minnelli...
...directing me in several pictures.
Her mother, the fabulous Judy Garland.
Yet this young lady has made it all on her own. Yes, she has.
Miss Liza Minnelli.
The first studio I'd ever been inside was MGM.
I can't really say that I grew up here.
But I know that for over 10 years,
I'd race like crazy after school...
...to get down here and visit whatever set my parents were on.
You may not know this...
...but I made my film debut at MGM.
MINNELLl: In the very last shot for
The Good Old Summertime...
...they needed a little girl to play the daughter...
...of Van Johnson and Mama.
Guess who got the part.
There she is, folks. What personality.
No wonder I didn't get any billing.
It's no wonder this place will always be a part of me.
My father directed dozens of films here...
...and Mama, well, this was her home for over 15 years...
...and 30 films.
It began in 1935.
MINNELLl:
In an MGM musical short...
...a vaudeville team called the Gumm Sisters...
...made their first appearance on film.
Twelve-year-old Frances was the standout...
...and talent scouts from MGM decided to give her a chance.
But first they changed her name from Frances Gumm to Judy Garland.
The studio put Mom in another short subject.
This time they paired her off with a young operatic singer named...
...Deanna Durbin.
These musical shorts were like a screen test.
In those days, if you came across in a two-reeler...
...you just might have a chance in a real musical.
Swing
North, south, east, west
Just swing
You'll find that swing is best
Swing
Make it a national thing
You'll find
There is a chance for romance
Here on the dance floor, so dance
Dance, dance, dance
America
MINNELLl: Although MGM would drop
Deanna Durbin...
...some executives at the studio pleaded to keep my mother under contract.
And they finally won.
Well, they kept her at MGM just barely.
She spent the next few years in low-budget musicals.
Once in a while, she'd appear as a sort of novelty act...
...in a big extravaganza like the Broadway Melody of 1938...
...with Buddy Ebsen.
Mama once told me...
...MGM seemed obsessed with Shirley Temple.
They even offered 20th Century Fox
Jean Harlow and Clark Gable...
...just to get Temple for a certain picture
Metro was preparing.
But the deal fell through.
So MGM finally went ahead with the picture...
...and let Mama play the role of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
You're off to see the wizard
The wonderful wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was
The wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandelion
A fate I don't deserve
I'd be brave as a blizzard
I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a Wizard
Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
- A heart
- A home
The nerve
MINNELLl:
The Wizard of Oz finally did it for Mama.
With Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr...
...she really started off on the road to success.
Whatever rocks or bumps there were in that road...
...she never let it show in her films.
For Mama, it was straight up all the way.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more skies of gray
Than any Russian play
Could guarantee
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings
From the moment I saw him, I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump
Went my heartstrings
When he smiled
I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat and took a seat
He said he hoped
He hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak
Because he scared me half to death
Howdy Doody!
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Flop, flop, flop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
As he started to go
Then I started to know
How it feels
When the universe reels
If you like-a me, like I like-a you
And we like-a both the same
I like-a say this very day
I like-a change your name
'Cause I love-a you and love-a you true
And if you-a love-a me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the bamboo tree
How can I ignore
The boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me
Glance his way
MINNELLl: Summer Stock was Mama's final film for MGM.
Her last days of shooting here were devoted to this number...
...which a lot of people including myself feel was one of her very best.
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
We're going to the promised land
We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
Chase your cares away
Hallelujah
Get happy
Before the judgment day
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
We're going to be going to the promised land
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready
For the judgment day
Thank God for film.
It can capture a performance and hold it right there forever.
And if anyone says to you,
"Who was he?" or "Who was she?"
Or "What made them so good?"
I think a piece of film answers that question better than any words I know of.
My generation...
Well, we're just beginning.
It takes a lot of film and a lot of experience...
...and a lot of talent to become a real star.
Now here's somebody who I think qualifies on all of those counts. Oh, boy.
Mr. Bing Crosby.
You know, one sound stage, well, it looks pretty much like another.
But a backlot, out here where they shoot the exteriors...
...that seems to me that the backlot reflects the personality...
...the character of its studio.
This was the biggest...
...and I think, perhaps, the best backlot in all of Hollywood.
Of course the old backlot looks a little shabby right now, sort of scruffy...
...kind of an illusion on an illusion...
...but that's because most Hollywood filmmakers...
...they don't use backlots any more.
They prefer the real thing.
Hollywood
Hollywood
I remember when I did my first musical at this studio...
...they designed a big production number.
It was all to take place in a vast Manhattan railroad terminal.
Of course we didn't bother to go to New York City.
MGM simply recreated
Grand Central Station...
...added a couple of thousand extras and filmed the whole number right here.
Once again
Goodbye, pal
Out where they say
Let us be gay
I'm going Hollywood
I'll ballyhoo greetings to you
I'm going Hollywood
Say, while you sleepyheads
Are in that hay
I'll be dancing
I'm gonna be dancing
With a sun-kissed baby
And I'm on my way
Here's my beret
I'm going Hollywood
Well, it was vigorous. Spirited, anyhow.
I was, what you might call, a casual participant in MGM musicals...
...because over 20 years went by...
...between the little effort which you've just seen...
...and my next attempt.
And I found fantastic changes had occurred.
They had color, oh, stereophonic sound, even wide screens.
And MGM, in a loose moment, had decided to give me another chance...
...in a little pastiche to be called High Society.
This starred Grace Kelly, Louis Armstrong, and Celeste Holm...
...and was directed by Chuck Walters.
Oh, yes, there was another featured performer in there.
What was his name?
A brash young newcomer. Frank, uh...
A clever kid.
He had a lot to offer too. Frank, uh...
Well, you'll recognize him when you see the footage.
Have you heard about dear Blanche?
- Got run down by an avalanche
- No.
Don't worry, she's a game girl, you know.
Got up and finished fourth.
- Kid's got guts.
- Having a nice time?
Grab a line.
- Have you heard that Mimsie Starr
- What now?
- She got pinched in the Astor Bar
- Sauced again, eh?
She was stoned.
- Well, did you ever?
- Never.
What a swell party this is
- I'm gonna have a drink.
- I may have a bit of the bubbly myself.
- I'm gonna dance.
- Don't get hurt.
Oh, no.
- It's great
- It's great
- It's grand
- So grand
It's wonderland
- We sing
- We sing
- So rare
- So rare
Like old Camembert
Like baba au rhum
Don't dig that kinda croonin', chum
You must be one of the newer fellas.
Have you heard?
It's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party
Swell party
Swellegant, elegant party
This is
While I give to you
And you give to me
True love
So on and on
It'll always be
True love
For you and I
Have a guardian angel
On high
With nothing to do
But to give to you
And to give to me
Love forever
True
Love forever
True
I'm recalling times when I was falling
Like a free jubilee day
Get this cast:
Russ Tamblyn, Vic Damone,
Tony Martin...
...Kay Armen, Debbie Reynolds,
Jane Powell, Ann Miller...
...and the Pacific Fleet...
...in Hit the Deck.
Sing hallelujah, hallelujah
And you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue ya
Hallelujah
Gets you thru the darkest day
Satan lies a-waitin'
- And creatin' skies of gray
- Skies of gray
But hallelujah, hallelujah
Helps to shoo the clouds away
Satan lies a-waitin'
- And creatin' skies of gray
- Hallelu
But hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Helps to shoo the clouds away
Sing hallelu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lujah
The next time anyone says that dancing is for sissies...
...remind them of
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
Produced by Jack Cummings, directed by Stanley Donen...
...and choreographed by Michael Kidd...
...it's perhaps the most vivid and exuberant ballet ever put on film.
Gigi
Am I a fool without a mind
Or have I merely been too blind to realize
Oh, Gigi
Why you've been growing up
Before my eyes
Gigi
You're not at all
That funny awkward little girl
I knew
Oh, no
Overnight there's been
A breathless change
In you
One of the finest musicals ever made...
...Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's Gigi.
It was that rare blend of story and song...
...and it starred Leslie Caron,
Louis Jourdan, Hermione Gingold...
...and the marvelous Maurice Chevalier.
All under the inspired direction of Vincente Minnelli.
- May I come in?
- Yes.
Gaston, please.
No newspapers, no scandal.
Madame, will you do me the honor...
...the favor...
...give me the infinite joy of bestowing on me...
...Gigi's hand in marriage.
Thank heaven.
For little girls
For little girls get bigger every day
Thank heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you crashin'
Through the ceiling
Thank heaven for little girls
Thank heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who
Without them, what would little boys do?
- Thank heaven
- Thank heaven
Thank heaven
For little girls
Through the years, MGM has produced over 200 musical films.
And if you had to select one number from one film...
...that would best represent the MGM musicals...
...I have a feeling that the vote would be unanimous...
...especially among the people who worked here...
...and that's why we've saved the best for the last.
An American in Paris, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.
It won an Oscar as best picture of the year...
...over 20 years ago.
But the ballet from that film...
...is as timeless as the day you and I first saw it.
Produced by Arthur Freed, directed by Vincente Minnelli...
...and choreographed by Gene Kelly...
...it can only be described as MGM's masterpiece.
We all dream of journeys into the universe, into our inner self
The mysterious path goes inwards; into night
If I offered in one Hand: the gold of speculation
...the full beer-belly of a government official...
...happiness and all the playthings of the world...
...but in the other hand:
...the longing for paradise and the music of our ideas...
...then everybody would blindly choose paradise...
...even if it were the false paradise...
...greedy for sacrificial blood...
...and ready to offer the best of themselves...
...involving our hopes with the greatest cruelties...
...for the benefit of lunatic triumphs of the human soul
Conceiling within ourselves all erroneous conclusions...
...the banality and baroque asceticism of mass rituals
Long is the legend of faith...
...its victories over us and its defeats through us
Scenario and direction
Co-producers
Archive sound
Dedicated to Henri Langlois and
the Cinémathéque Francaise
...for "Film - the Music of the
Future", the aesthetic of this film
l have planned one thing,
the gentleman are quite right
We are intolerant. l have only
one aim: to sweep away...
...all the thirty parties from Germany
They keep on mistaking me for a
bourgois or Marxist politician...
...who is today SPD, tomorrow USPD...
...the next day Communist,
the next day Trade Unionist...
...or today Democrat and tomorrow
German Peoples Party...
...then economic Party
They mix us up with
one of their own kind
We have only one aim and we shall fight
for it with a fanatical ruthlessness...
...until death!
HitIer A FiIm from Germany
From the Cosmic Ash-Tree to Goethe's
Oak and the Beeches of Buchenwald
Ladies and GentIemen!
This show is about a man who is guiIty of everything
Like Napoleon; a German NapoIeon of the twentieth century
Or, better, an inhuman brute...
...a man who never laughed without putting his hand before his mouth...
...and who kicked his dog away if he was caught stroking the animaI
Who said: "In the beginning, everybody Iaughed about me
''Not onIy a few are Iaughing and soon nobody wilI Iaugh any more"
This show's about somebody who had nothing to Iose...
...somebody who never can be dupIicated
Ladies and GentIemen, now we're rid of the Kaiser and God, we can begin
The song of songs
The story to top aIl stories
Let's give him his chance;
Iet's give ourseIves our chance
Taboos, this show's about taboos
Either give your audience a stunning show...
...or stay home with your canary
Yes, sir, CulturaI RevoIution,
Art for the PeopIe
The PeopIe's right of seIf-expression...
...to put on a show
There have been parades and triumphaI, sun-symbolizing banners...
...since Caesar's Rome and CaIiguIa
Mankind in the century of the fiIm.
AII or nothing
The man who banished unemployment...
...who drove the money.changers from the tempIe...
...and cIeansed the houses of sex and crime
The man of the twentieth century
The man of humble origins...
...who came from the peopIe, Iike every one of us, from the masses
Hurrah! The deviI is Ioose
Knaves and trumps, perversions and racketeering
Who couId then stand aIoof?
Hit them hard, beat the deviI
A merry apocaIypse,
Experiment "End of the WorId"...
...something about our woIfish society
Here are the ruIes of the game:
There'II be no heroes, except ourseIves
There'II be no story, only ours, our inside story
CIouded visions, with bloody orgies before the finaI daybreak
No human stories, but a history of mankind
No disaster fiIm but disaster as fiIm...
...the end of the worId, the great fIood, the finaI cosmic agony so we've no intimate scenes about the fear and misery of the Third Reich...
...nothing about the "cabbage trust" gangster politics of the times
Rather, something about the faith that moves mountains...
...and a peopIe's Ieader without equal
Summon up aII our strength, your gIadness and your sorrow
ln a few hours we shall see here the
biggest mass meeting ever assembled
AII who want to see StaIingrad again, or the 20th of JuIy plot...
...or the lone woIf's Iast days in his bunker...
...or the Nuremberg of Leni
RiefenstahI, wiII be disappointed
We aren't showing the unrepeatabIe reaIity...
...nor the emotionaI dramas of the victims...
...nor the factuaI documentary approach...
...nor the money-spinners that trade on moraIity, on horror...
...on fear, death, repentance, arrogance and rightous anger
The German worker, centre of this
celebration, has surpassed himself
This is no Ieft wing opportunist death-camp sex fiIm
This is a film for us.
It's about war and genocide
Auschwitz as the battIefieId of race war
Who does the worId hold guiIty? And what wouId HitIer be without us?
This fiIm's about the divine spark in man...
...about the starry sky above us and the moraI law within myself
It's about fantasies of the mind and their bIoody reaIization
MephistopheIes playing to a fuII house, which is burning
Once again
But how shalI we? ls it for art?
MoraI philosophy, after fifty miIIion dead? SiIence? Are we to remain siIent?
It concerns us. Not the "haves"...
...but us, the "have nots"...
...who Iive in hope...
...who put our hopes in those who wilI finalIy take some action...
...who go aIong with them...
...who went aIong with everything, just once, and even that was wrong
It's about the biggest crisis in human existence...
...worId-wide, with new techniques
I warned, I Ludwig the second...
...warned from the beginning...
... l warned that business, specuIation...
...fiIms, pornography, poIitics...
...were alI show for the masses
Entertainment, to make money
But how can one, how can I, how can you...
...and I mean this seriously...
...be entertained by tragic events, the work of a few madmen?
Were the perpetrators aIl criminaIs?
Were the victims aII good peopIe?
Masochists. Systems. Laws
Lawers. Academics
Newspapers. PeopIe
A nation. SociaIism. Workers... madness
And have some charity for such transgression
But what shouId we be without that guiIt?
We Iive off the success of sorrow, don't we? felix cuIpa... O happy guiIt!
A sad but nice bit of business in the name of art
But how am I to do it?
How can anyone unsympathetic to this subject go on and make such a fiIm?
ShouIdn't I, shouIdn't we...
...live without this fiIm, push aside our thougts...
...think of something eIse, something more important?
He shaIl, he must have his chance
Let him be born, Iike alI of us, and have a mother...
...be permitted to learn, to Iove and to hate
InfIuenced by what and by whom?
Why did he take this or that decision?
And if, at the end, he must appear as he did...
...let us aIIow him to begin again as we aII do...
...when we came into the worId
What shall it profit a man if he gain
the whole world...
... and have no love
and lose his own soul?
Quotations...watch out, everybody: quotations!
The whoIe western cuIture and the Christian God are part of this
We're in between Jesus and Hitler
Which brings us to the jews and the persecutors...
...and the transactions and the whoIe madness of the ideas...
...and seIf-hatred and Iove mixed up with them
They aII envy me for this puppet, vitaIly essentiaI as it is
But what shaII I do... if it sees things, Iike the staircase of tears...
A grandfather... who shows his grandchild the stars...
...to distract it
The good oId stars, taken from us
Iong ago by the smog of the cities
A mother with her baby in her arms
BIack uniformed men...
...with skuIls on their caps... aII around their caps, and a machine-gun in their hands...
...the bodies, stiII warm, trembling in the ditch...
...into which they, too, must go
Shots in the night, curses...
...whispers beneath the night stars
Who can hear the great curse in the stones aIl around?
No sIeep...
...for the chiIdren and chiIdren's chiIdren of the guiIty
Music over everything
Music enhances everything
When, during the Iast war...
...the great comedian KarI VaIentin stepped onto a Munich stage...
...amid victory ceIebrations he sang, very quietIy...
...the German foIk-songs:
ln deepest cellar, here I sit;
what is coming from the sky?
And: Oh, my dear Augustin,
everything's gone
That VaIentin did not seII his famous coIIection of postcards to AdoIf HitIer
In it was the card of the chiId Ludwig with a beard
He refused the offer of
100,000 Reichsmark...
...and a Iife pension of a thousand marks a month
...because Hitler demanded he should stop making fiIms
Where, I wonder, would I find another VaIentin...
...who wouId say no to such offers?
After the war, he was informed by the then boss of Bavarian Radio...
...that his services would no Ionger be needed, due to his lack of humor
Then the great Valentin wept for the first time, before he died
Weeping after HitIer had gone, that was our VaIentin
He no Ionger had a chance to object to anything
The peopIe after HitIer had no more use for that VaIentin
God aIways created ten who beat their breasts, lamenting...
...and one fooI who entertained them,
Iaughing
Which are you?
Forward! forward!
the trumpets are calling
Forward! forward!
youth knows no danger
No matter how high the aim
Youth will reach it
Our flag leads us on
We step towards the future
We march on for Hitler,
through night and danger
With the flag of youth,
for freedom and bread
Our flag leads us on
Our flag is the new era
Our flag leads us on to eternity
Yes, our flag is greater than death
German youth!
As we have decided to put on a show together, in democratic fashion...
...about how he and we came to power...
...let's go the whoIe hog
Let's make it a fun show, for once, everyone can join in
It's bound to be shocking: that man his misdeeds and us heIping him
So let's start yeIling right away
PrimaI yelI-therapy! We'Il go far back into our childhood
Back into our most secret wishes, dreams and stories
As we have no Hitler to exhibit in a cage...
...to spit at, kick or kiss his hands...
...according to our individual tastes, for the fee of a few marks...
...the way LoIa Montès, in her day...
...could be touched in an
American circus, for a doIIar
I suggest each of us pIays himseIf...
...acts here, in front of alI, his own version of HitIer...
...as he acts him stiII today, at home...
...in his Iittle room, before the mirror...
...or on a motor cycIe... with swastika and Madonna as lucky charms...
...on his chest, beneath his
Ieather jacket...
...as he drives against the wind
Let's make it a commerciaI fiIm...
...for, after alI, fiIm has aIways been a commerciaI business
No, pIease, think back, deep into yourseIf
Never was there a man so Ioved and so hated
Never has so much been projected by so many into one man
This is about us, aIl of us
It's about the happiness we were promised and never given
It's about the peopIe who elected him and sacrificed everything for him...
...themseIves and their ideas...
...sons, fathers, friends and their image of the world
Cities, whoIe countries, their conscience and their souIs
It's about the HitIer within us...
On a smaII budget, without sets, with sIide projections...
...and our imaginations, where everyone can join in
The worId as a circus and as a fairground side-show
So let's give him and ourseIves a chance
Silence, please!
The Führer will show himself
just once more...
...and then asks all to go home,
as he has many conferences
Neither the Party nor the common wilI spurred me on
It was the thousands who kiIled themseIves to escape the Depression
Soon l shaIl ensure perfect order in society
PIutocrats and Jewish eIements want to dictate to the German worker!
This is now absoIuteIy and soIey in my power
Germany is HitIer! HitIer is Germany!
AII those fanaticaI opponents, I know where they'lI be going: into misery...
...where they have Iong beIonged
Perfect order in society.
I repeat: perfect order
You can judge...
...how l have felt since those days
and how l feel now
l am so overjoyed...
...that fate has chosen me...
...to complete the great union
of the German people
lt is absolutely certain that our new
community will nevermore be dissolved
You ruthIess tyrants, you servants of
BaaI, you judges of Sodom!
Your Iimbs shaII wither
Your Iiving bodies shaII decay
The bones of your children and your chiIdren's chiIdren wiII fester!
Each day shaII bring you misfortune...
...and pain shalI drive sIeep from your eyes
Germany has become Greater Germany
And shall remain so!
Not onIy the genius of the Commander- in-Chief has Ied to victory...
...but also providence
Yet they don't know, all the same,
that Rumpelstiltskin is my name
The entire nation is assembled
for the final roll-call...
...to hear your great,
historic statement
l ask you, my Führer, to speak to us
We want our Führerl
German fellow-countrymen and woman
This is the third time that l speak
in a frontier town...
...on the occasion of a plebiscite
ln 1933 it was Königsberg
lt was there, on the 4th March...
...that l urged the nation within
the then frontiers of the Reich...
...to show it's faith in me...
...to enable me...
...independent of parliamentary
difficulties...
...to take hold of Germany's destiny
and shape it more auspiciously
The second time l spoke in a frontier
town it was Cologne...
...on the 28th March, 1936...
...again an the eve of a plebiscite...
...when l had to appeal to
the German people...
...to endorse the very difficult
decision l made...
...a decision to restore the
formerly demilitarized zone...
...to the sovereignty of the Reich
Today l stand here in Vienna...
...on the eve of a decision...
...which l believe will go down
in the annals...
...of the German history
ln this town l'm the biggest sow
l only sleep with Jew-boys now
(First World War veterean )
lt was in 1915...
...I was blinded by a Russian grenade...
ln eighteen years of darkness...
...I was a part of the fatherland's
misery
But the German war-blind...
were never defeated by
their personel tragedy
A constant will-power...
...drove us to contribute
to the fatherland
lf today...
...a greater hope for the future
shines over Germany...
...then that bright light
also penetrates our lives...
...and gives us new strength
This day will become the reward...
...for our sacrifices
Once more there'll be honesty,
discipline and faith
Let this day of spring...
...be a symbol...
...of a bright, beautiful Germany
once more
Fellow Germans! At this moment...
...when the guns greet the day of
victory with their thunderous salute...
...I call on you as one of the
millions who gave of their utmost
Therefore, be united,
close the ranks...
...to hasten the longed-for day
of liberty
Be true to your vow:
All for Germany,
our beloved fatherland!
But I can't heIp what l do!
I can't... I can't heIp what l do
The oId story!
What do you know?
Who are you to taIk?
Who are you?
What are you? You're aII criminals!
Maybe you're even proud of your safe-breaking...
...or burgIary or card-sharping
You need do any of these things...
...if you'd Iearned a proper trade, if you worked...
...if you weren't such Iazy swine
I can't heIp myseIf
I can't controI this eviI thing inside me...
...this fire...
...the voices...
...the torment
You mean you've got to murder?
AII the time...
It drives me through the streets, as though someone's foIIowing me
It's me, pursuing myseIf
ReIentlessly
But it's stiIl me
Yes, sometimes it's as though...
... l'm pursuing myself
I must escape
I must escape, fIee before myseIf
But it's impossible
I have to run, I must run through endIess streets
I want to escape...
But the ghosts are pursuing me, the ghosts of the mothers...
...the ghosts of the children, aIways there
Those chiIdren...
...those children are aIways there...
...and then I...except...
...except when I do it
Then I see the posters
I read the posters about what I have done
I read and read. Did I do that?
But I can't remember anything about it
But who wilI beIieve me?
I'm forced to do it;
I don't want to, but l must
Who knows what it's like to be me?
I must do it! l don't want to, but I must!
I must do it, l can't stop it!
I must do it, but no one wiIl beIieve me!
Sometimes he, too...
...thought his wiIl-power was cut off...
...and he was being punished for whoIe generations of his ancestors...
...people and stars...
...but he had to go through with it
And when he woke up suddenIy in the night...
...and thought he had seen it...
...the new man...
...he yeIIed and foamed at the mouth...
...and he had to be caImed and washed, but no one was aIlowed to speak of it
He proceeded with unbelievabIe harshness against himself
Against any softening of his inner feeIings...
...and against his desire for enjoyment and gentleness...
...which of course existed in him as in any other human being...
...but was unimportant in his struggle...
...in the seIf-imposed mission of a life that has marked this century
Just as he did not alIow his mother to caress him...
...because it interfered with his Iove for himseIf...
...and for his chosen, purer mother...
...the German people whose Iove he craved
And how he condemned everything in the end...
...in the bunker of his faiIure when, resigned to his fate... he surrendered to Eva's servant- girl Iove and married her
He cursed PoIand...
...which wouId never beIong to him...
...and for which the EngIish entered the war
And on his embittered Iips...
...a curse on France and EngIand and their inevitable decIine...
...predicting the end of
European power...
...so so cIosely Iinked with the destruction of Germany...
...divided between East and West...
...governed by oiI interests and bureaucratic states...
...by bribed poIiticians, whoever and wherever they are...
...finaIIy only as an aged HitIer...
...ailing since StaIingrad, knowing that not onIy the war was lost...
...but also the sacrificing of miIlions of enemies...
...as he considered the Jews and the war opponents...
...was in vain...
...suffering the tortures of heII for years, to end a living corpse
A corpse with a trembIing arm and breath...
...summoning his last strength...
...surveying a world which was not worthy of him
Here is a speciaI bulIetin on the
Army High Command communiqué
The Army High Command reports...
...an astounding German victory over
France after a mere six week campaign
There has been a cease-fire
since 01.35 today ( 25th June, 1940 )
The onIy one who wilI acknowIedge him.. .
...wilI be a bIack african ruIer, quite mad...
...respected by alI, in the United Nations...
...ranting against Jews quite openIy...
...and received without demur by the CathoIic Pope
Thirty years after his death...
...his end in petroI and ruins, burned by his servants and drivers
Madness is his Iegacy, and that is onIy the beginning
AII of us, standing around heIpIess...
...before this man, created in God's image, even he? HitIer Iike us
A part of us, in us? In aII of us?
Our reunion with aour allies restores
freedom to the world...
...and greatness to our country
Many lie in graves besides their
fathers who fell in the Great War
They testify to a silent heroism...
...they are the symbol of hundreds of
thousends of riflemen, tank crews...
...pioneers, gunners, sailors,
marines, airmen...
...men of the Waffen-SS
and all other fighters...
...who have joinedthe armed struggle
for our freedom and future...
...and for the eternal greatness of
the National Socialist Reich
(RolI-caII of Nazi martyrs at a comme- moration of the Munich putsch of 1923 )
AII are rogues, incIuding me
But if we are, Iet us be the greatest
And I'II see to it: in a hundred years every word that each of us says...
...wilI be in a fiIm
The part you pIay in it is up to you
I'lI make you into Iegend, into myth
Through your death, if necssary
Yes, you can Iaugh down there...
...but try to foIlow my example: conquer the world in twenty-three years und change it from top to bottom
I'm the devil incarnate...
...yet a human being who Iaughed at
Mickey Mouse, just as you do
CuIture?
When I hear the word cuIture,
I reach for my pistoI
That's the art for the people that we want
Our cuItural revoIution is for a more popuIar art, an art of the peopIe
Art is an exaIted mission which demands fanaticism
No peopIe Iives Ionger than the documents of its culture
We pay with our Iives for art
Everything is going to be out in the open
Let's have some peace and quiet
Yes, we are the beasts of prey of mankind
But why don"t you give us the rights of the fox and hyena amongst people...
...the Ione, ravaging wolf in the society of woIves?
With our own marks of race, recognizabIe, pursuabIe...
...fighting for our hungry brood, the Iive-aims of our kind...
...fair game, without the right to
Iive, but not to be tortured...
...not disowned or soId by the traders in so-caIIed moraIity
Exterminate us, but don"t exploit us commerciaIly, if you want to be better...
...than the morality with which we have aIways characterized you
We aren't ghosts; you're supposed to be afraid when you see me
So be afraid
They were afraid when they saw me
I taught them, because I am a schooImaster...
... l taught them to eat of the tree of knowlegde once more...
...to gain a new innocence...
...and that wiIl be the end of the worId
And it was the end of the worId
Who wiII ask, in five hundred years...
...if Fräulein SchuItze or
FräuIein MüIIer was unhappy...
...after they have considered my work?
Who asks, when admiring the pyramids of the Pharaohs...
...how many sIaves perished beneath the stones?
We Iive by oId, Iiving traditions
I am so frustrated, so very frustrated
My friends have invited me to one of those big meetings
He spoke as he aIways spoke
There was a brawI, bottIes were thrown, chairs, eggs
My jacket was wet and stained
SuddenIy he, a stranger, stood before me and gave me his jacket
I stood before him in his jacket...
...like armour, burning around me; he had chosen me out of thousands
It was his choice and it was right, as he aIways chose rightIy
Iater l heIped him conduct his war, as only I couId organize it...
...his war minister and an artist, as he was
That's how I met him and I stuck it out with him to the end
I don't know either, what made me choose him
Did l choose him, or did he choose me?
It had to happen one way or the other
Did l choose him, or did it happen the way I toId you?
Yes, that's what we make of him:
AdoIf the degenerate Punch
MineraI water instead of beer...
...vegetarian food instead of roast pork...
...Sieg HeiI instead of gobbledegook...
...and Sieg Heil, that's German progress, Punch as Ieader
Yes, the Ieader as Punch
It's the vengeance of heII that they Iive on as cIowns
AdoIf must yodeI, keep on yodeIIing
And Eva must dance for ever.
At the October FestivaI
The chiIdren wiII laugh at immortaI Punch and Judy...
...the big number, that is the first stage of punishment in heII's ante-room
The cIown as Hitler in us
If the ideas and ideaIs of the masses demand it...
...we are aIways good, l can vouch for it
Let mediocrity ruIe the world; against individuaIists it's implacable, ice-coId
The Hitler of the simpIe man in the street, that's me
But he, the boss, must never go inside god does not tolerate him in heIl, he would burst it
Perhaps because he's too big
Lost, he's Iooking for a new pIace between heaven and heII...
...and that means Earth again
In which disguise? Made immortaI through us, in us?
I'm a workman's son, yes sir, and what's more...
... l'm a workman's son who's strictly Roman Catholic
Strictly Catholic, with an academic education at our universities
And do I Iook like a German, eh?
But I shaII pIant time-bombs of hero worship...
...and understanding and rebirth of NationaI SociaIism
They wiII exIode in a hundred years, or sooner, or Iater
As Iong as man and democracy exist, anyway, in eternalIy new disguises
That is the secret of my message...
...the propaganda of steeIy romanticism
When we depart, the whole universe shaII trembIe
Nobody wilI ever be worthy of us...
...despite aIl democracies and dictatorships of the masses everywhere
PeopIe keep saying that none of it is true, that I'm not reaI
Some say l'm a monster, others taIk of the endIess nuIlity of my deeds the boIsheviks aIways say l'm a man of the plutocrats...
...and the pIutocrats aIways Iump together the red and brown plagues
None of them understood anything
What did we have in common with Marx, or Krupp of the decIining upper class?
Some say none of it is true, others speak of me as a god, not as a human
As if it had neverbeen achieved, the rise from nothing...
...the peopIe's community of workers by head and workers by fist
That's what they aIl wanted
The fantastic expIosion of the war...
...the victory over France and the whoIe of Europe...
...miIIions dead, concentration camps, the bombing l initiated
...the methods of incineration, euthanasia and the catastrophes
So friends and foes try to erase me
But everything was onIy invention...
...what a weaIth of fantasy...
...and that's why I Iove KarI May, the honest writer
We're deaIing with the rise of the new man of the masses...
...his outstanding leader-figures...
...and the survivaI of man, whether they want it or not
This is about the HitIer of the simpIe man
And what is this man Iike, whom they eIected from their ranks?
He encompasses Volkswagen and concentration camp...
...WoIfsburg and Auschwitz,
Bayreuth and UFA and ObersaIzberg
(10th May 1933)
All German transmitters calling
We are at the Opernplatz,
Unter den Linden, Berlin
The Berlin districts German students'
organization...
...with the Action Fighting Committee
Against the un-German Spirit...
...is at this moment burning books
of immortal and destructive content
You will hear the fire-slogans
of Berlin's students
Then Minister Dr. Goebbels will speak
Against the soul-destroying
over-estimation of the sex-life...
...and for the nobility of
the human soul...
...I surrender to the flames the
writings of the Sigmund Freud school
Against the falsification of history
and degradation of it's heroes...
...and for respect for our past...
Against the literary treason to our
soldiers of the World War...
...for the education of our people...
Against the arrogant debasement
of the German language...
...for the preservation of the most
precious gift of our people...
Against insolence and arrogance...
...for the respect and appreciation...
...of the immortal spirit
of the German people...
...devour, O flame, the writings of
Tucholsky and Ossietsky
Students, German men and women
The era of Jewish intellectual
sophistry is now over. ( Goebbels)
End of Part One
"Jack lifted the lid of the great stone oven and dropped inside.
"From his hiding place he heard a mighty rumbling voice.
"Fee, fie, foe, fum.
"I smell the blood of an Englishman.
"Be he alive or be he dead.
"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"
Whoa, pony!
Hello, love.
What have you got?
Peter called while you were out.
He left this for you.
Tour dates.
This is tomorrow...
Good evening.
The Song Remains The Same.
It's fucking true!
It comes only suddenly inside the building.
No, no, man. You know, one of those...
- Are they good?
- No, they're fucking terrible!
Those photos.
- Not again.
- They're very sexual.
I think we ought to be part of it.
When you give him a call, nobody knows.
This is a song that sometimes takes a building...
...in a manner which our forefathers were very used to.
Did you hear that?
It's right though, isn't it?
That feeling that's left everybody.
The cosmic energy!
Everybody cheers.
Jimmy Page, guitar.
Not fast enough.
This is called No Quarter.
Don't fucking talk to me. It's my bloody act. I think I'll leave you anytime.
You couldn't even give them a starting line.
Are you telling me you let...
It wouldn't happen in Europe!
I don't know how the guy got in the building.
This isn't Europe or England.
I can see that. You're so inefficient!
- Somebody got it.
- Talk to me.
I'm the manager for this group.
You had people inside this building selling posters...
...and you didn't know about it!
I didn't know about it. As soon as we found out about it, we stopped it.
As soon as we found out about it and told you, you stopped it!
All right, so you found out before I did.
How much kickback are you getting?
None. I knew nothing about it.
Come on! You don't know what the concession is?
Your mate's selling the T-shirts and making the deals.
And he told Richard about it also.
He came back, didn't he?
He does everything, doesn't he?
He does the security one night...
One night he's the guard of the fucking dressing room.
That's fucking typical, isn't it?
As long as we screw an extra few bob out of the group...
You really think I get something out of it?
You are the fucking controller!
That's like saying that anyone who jumps on the stage, I'm responsible for, too.
Of course not. You're responsible to see that the concessionaire...
You rented it. You controlled it.
Isn't selling fucking pirate posters.
You have to wait for someone else to tell you what it's doing.
It doesn't matter so long as there's an extra nickel to be drained.
By exploiting Led Zeppelin, it's great.
With the fucking Stars and Stripes behind it.
We never took a dime in concession yet.
On anything.
This is called The Song Remains The Same.
Any tickets for sale?
Any tickets for sale?
How many guys out there?
Two now.
We're in good shape. Only two.
Can we get in?
- Ask these guys. They're in charge.
- Can we get in?
If it's up to me, yeah.
Thank you!
Hey, thanks a lot!
A lot of fun!
Jimmy Page, electric guitar.
Do you expect trouble?
No comment.
That's all you're going to get.
No comment is more incriminating than a comment.
- Is it?
- Yes.
No comment.
I think this is a song of hope.
Our percussionist, John Bonham.
Moby Dick.
One hundred thirty pounds of glory,
John Bonham!
Led Zeppelin's road manager says
he put the money in the deposit box...
... and when he went back it was all gone.
The police say there was money in the box,
but they can't tell exactly how much.
The group's personal manager, Peter Grant,
discussed the theft...
... at a news conference today.
It's brought back by our attorney, physically carried...
...because that's his function...
...and when he comes back...
...it's put into a safe-deposit box.
Police said they were questioning anyone
who had access to the safe-deposit box...
... but that's all they would say.
The money is reportedly the largest amount ever taken...
...from a hotel safe-deposit box in New York City.
We asked the client, there wasn't money in the box.
Probably one of his clerks.
He noted one of the transactions.
Today was our leaving day, anyhow, so we had that amount of money...
...because we had to pay our airplanes and hotels.
After he met with newsmen,
police took Grant himself...
... and two of his employees
to the precinct for questioning.
New York, goodbye.
The doubt while the jury is out
Or the thrill when they're reading the will
Or the chase for the man with the face
That's entertainment
The dame who is known as the flame
Of the king of an underworld ring
He's an ape who won't let her escape
That's entertainment
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene where a ghost and a prince meet
And everyone ends in mincemeat
The gag may be waving that flag
That began with a Mr. Cohan
Hip hooray the American way
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
That's entertainment
Here we are!
All right.
That's entertainment
Look what I can do!
It's still me!
It's still me!
And now, as we carry right on
We call upon charming Leslie Caron
Anywhere you can watch Fred Astaire
That's entertainment
A scene played by Judy and Gene
It's a song that goes ringing along
Garbo's dance has a touch of romance
That's entertainment
"The show must go on" is the show business cry
But there's always someone who wants to know why
With Robert Taylor
I'll try to come up with an answer
It's Eleanor Powell the dancer
More
There is much more in store
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
The bells are ringing
For me and my gal
For Me and My Gal was my first film... and, boy, was I lucky.
I co-starred with Judy Garland.
That's what I call starting at the top.
Knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
They've been sewing something old and something new
Sew something that is blue so they can make a trousseau for my gal
They're congregating for me and my gal
Look here!
Why, that's the parson waiting for me and my gal
And sometime
We're going to build a little home
For two
- Or three
- Or four
- Or five
- Or maybe more
Loveland for me and my gal
Fascinating rhythm, you got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm, I'm all a-quiver
Fred, I hear tap-dancing is popular again.
And here's a lady who will keep it that way. ;
Eleanor Powell.
Each morning I'm waking up
Very happy just to find that no work has been done
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
A couple of weeks
Somewhere far away off
But make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the man that I used to be
Oh, fascinating rhythm
Won't you stop picking on me?
I've got a feeling you're fooling
I've got a notion it's make-believe and you are laughing right up your sleeve
Mr. Kelly, would you tell me a couple of things... you never expected to see?
Well, Mr. Astaire, I never expected to see
Robert Taylor singing.
Moments of paradise
You're such a standout but how you hand out that
I've got a feeling you're fooling
I've got a feeling it's all a frame
It's just a well-known old army game
No fooling
- No fooling
- No fooling
No fooling
When I'm
When I'm fooling with you
And I certainly never expected to see
Greta Garbo dancing.
Fred, I hear that since you've been a kid... you always said you wanted to be a dancing man.
No, Gene. That's not true.
I never said anything like that in my life.
I wanna be a dancing man
While I can
Gonna leave my footsteps
On the sands of time
If I never leave a dime
A dancing man
With footsteps on the sands
Of rhythm
And rhyme
A dancing man
With footsteps on the sands
Of rhythm
A song of love is a sad song
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
One of my happiest discoveries was Leslie Caron.
After An American in Paris, she starred in Lili.
A song of love is a sad song
For I have loved, and it's so
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili
Hi-Lo
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
I always wanted to play a clown... and in The Pirate,
I finally got the chance... with Judy, and a terrific Cole Porter song.
Dress in huge baggy pants
And you'll ride the road to romance
A butcher or a baker ladies never embrace
A barber for a beau would be a social disgrace
They all will come to call if you can fall on your face
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown!
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Be the poor silly ass
And you'll always travel first class
The Brothers Marx hit our screens
With their zany routines
Groucho, brash and absurd
Harpo never uttered a word
Chico's quaint piano style
Had his audience in the aisle
They could have played French comedy, très, très élégant
Or scenes in English drawing rooms with riches to flaunt
But they knew they'd get far more laughs with Margaret Dumont
Be a
Chico!
Harpo!
Groucho!
- Wait a minute. This can't be my room.
- Yes, sir.
Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight? That's an awful big number for a birdcage this size.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you just put the stateroom in the trunk?
Sing ho!
For the open highway
Sing ho!
For the open road
- Hello, boss. What are you doing here?
- Hello.
This makes it a perfect voyage.
- I'm sorry. I thought this was my trunk.
- It is your trunk.
I don't remember packing you boys.
Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia.
He's sleeping it off.
That's as grisly a looking object as I've ever seen.
Get him up out of there.
- Yes?
- We've come to make up your room.
Come in, girls. Leave all hope behind.
Work fast because you gotta get out in 10 minutes.
Tomasso. Wake up.
They're going to fix the bed.
I'd like two pillows on that bed there.
There's a slight misunderstanding here.
I said the girls had to work fast, not your friend.
He's still asleep.
You know, he does better asleep than I do awake.
Yeah, he always sleeps that way.
- Now he's half-asleep.
- Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.
- All right, come on.
- Yes?
I'm the engineer.
I'm here to turn off the heat.
You can start right in on him.
Did you want a manicure?
No. Come on in.
I hadn't planned on a manicure, but on a journey like this... you ought to have every convenience you can get.
Did you want your nails long or short?
You better make them short.
It's getting kind of crowded in here.
I'm the engineer's assistant.
I had a premonition you were going to show up.
The engineer's over there in the corner.
You can chop your way right through.
Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?
I got plenty of room.
- Yes?
- Is my Aunt Minnie in here?
You can come in and prowl around if you want to.
If she isn't in here, you can probably find somebody just as good.
- Could I use your phone?
- Use the phone?
- I'll lay you even money you can't get in.
- How do you do?
This boat will be in New York before you get to that phone.
I came to mop up.
Just the woman I'm looking for.
Come right ahead.
You have to start on the ceiling.
It's the only place that's not occupied.
- You can clean my shoes if you want to.
- Operator.
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room, will you?
- Steward.
- Come right ahead.
- The food!
- We've been waiting all afternoon for you.
I want my Aunt Minnie!
From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be riding high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on
Kiss Me Kate with Cole Porter's lilting music... choreographed by Hermes Pan... and performed by Ann Miller and company.
That's Bob Fosse dancing with Carol Haney.
I wonder what ever happened to him.
I love the looks of you
The lure of you
I'd love to make a tour of you
The arms, the eyes the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you
Cyd Charisse, lovely Cyd Charisse.
How she dances.
This is from Silk Stockings.
I get too hungry for dinner at 8.;00
I like the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
Beautiful Lena Horne sings a great
Rodgers and Hart standard... from the film Words and Music.
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Don't dish the dirt
With the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, that's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Jerome Kern wrote some of the loveliest melodies I've ever heard.
And none lovelier than this one, sung by Kathryn Grayson... and danced by
Marge and Gower Champion.
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
I could hardly wait to keep our date
This lovely Easter morning
Someone once asked Jerome Kern... where in American music he would place Irving Berlin.
Mr. Kern replied,
"Irving Berlin is American music."
For
In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it
You'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade
I'll be all in clover and when they look us over
We'll be the proudest couple in the Easter parade
On the avenue
Fifth A venue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the guy I'm taking to the Easter parade
On the avenue
Fifth A venue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure
I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter parade
Anything that happens in life can happen on the screen
Fantasies appear
Colorful and queer
Watch me
You'll see just what I mean
First
Take the red from the scene
After that
Please remove all the green
Then the yellow and blue, make them disappear, too
What's left?
Black and white
But that's quite all right
It's entertainment
You came
I was alone
Here's Bing Crosby... starting us off in some numbers filmed in glorious black and white.
The siren he's singing to is Fifi D'Orsay.
The film is Going Hollywood.
Born to be kissed
I can't resist
You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart
Take it and say we'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you
Temptation
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Judy Garland told me that this is the song she sang... for her audition at MGM.
By the way, she got the job.
Zing! Went the strings of my heart!
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing! Went the strings of my heart!
The wonderful Ethel Waters in Cabin in the Sky.
And that's Rochester on guitar.
Here I go again
I'm hearing trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love
Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought the cards were a frame-up
And I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have our happy ending now
Taking a chance on love
Got to swing that jinx away
Swing a hi-de-hey
Hi-de-hey-de
Rap, tap on wood
Eleanor Powell in Born to Dance.
And she sure was.
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
The Army and Navy forever
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
Men, the ship we were waiting for is anchored in the river... but it's in the hands of the police.
Our plan's been discovered, and if we're ever to have our freedom... we've got to fight for it tonight.
Who's with me?
Not me.
All right, if I have to, I'll go alone.
- Wait, Charles. I'll go with you.
- One man at last.
And me, too.
Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald were the king and queen of operetta... and New Moon was one of their most popular.
Now we're 10! That makes an army.
Come on!
Give me some men
Who are stout-hearted men
Who will fight for the right they adore
Start me with ten
Who are stout-hearted men
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more
I'm going.
Shoulder to shoulder
And bolder and bolder
They grow as they go to the fore
Then there's nothing in the world
Can halt or mar a plan
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man
Charles, you can't fight the whole French fleet.
It's fight or perish for every man on this island.
- Charles.
- Goodbye, Marianne.
Forgive me for any grief
I've ever caused you.
Charles.
You'll come back, Charles.
You must come back to me.
This eager heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
Near or far, where ever you are
I'm coming back to you
Love will guide me
In the light that follows night
I'll see you smiling through
Your love
Will be beside me
The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while you're waiting there
This heart of mine is singing
I will come back
- To you
- To me
Oh, what a tune
One of my favorite comedians... also happens to be one of my favorite human beings... that lovable lunatic, Jimmy Durante.
It's got the whole world spooning
I'm walking down the street
I'm walking down the street
Tell me, Mr. James, now just what did you accomplish?
That note was given to me by Bing Crosby... and was he glad to get rid of it.
I got rhythm, I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
Now, Busby Berkeley's dude-ranch finale from Girl Crazy... with Judy, Mickey, and Tommy Dorsey.
Old Man Trouble,
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Take a pie in the face
And you'll wow the whole human race
In the beginning, there was slapstick comedy.
And Laurel and Hardy.
So you can't sleep?
Abbott and Costello being
Abbott and Costello.
I'm going to put this in your ears... and then when I go to sleep, you won't hear the record.
When I go to sleep, you take the arm off...
- and the record will stop, and I'll sleep.
- All right.
- Yes.
- Now how's that?
Everything all right?
How's that? All right?
Is that all right?
I said, is that all right?
- Is that all right, the stuff in your ears?
- Yes. Can't hear. Swell.
And when you go to sleep, I'll turn it off.
- Take it off. These are good.
- Go ahead and get your sleep.
I know I'll get some sleep.
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- What?
I says, I'm gonna get some sleep.
- That's what I'm here for.
- Then why do you keep saying...
- I can't hear you, please.
- Then keep them in your ears...
- you don't have to listen to nothing.
- What?
Look. Now listen.
Don't get excited, please. Will you?
With these in my ears, I can't hear.
Here. Try it yourself now. See that?
Now can you hear anything?
- What?
- Can you hear me?
You can't hear anything, can you?
How can I hear if you're gonna put these in my ears like that?
After all, I can't hear if you got them in my ears.
He's got them again.
In this 1929 film... among a group of songwriters, we find...
Well, he'll introduce himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce myself.
My name is Jack Benny, and I was asked... to be master of ceremonies for this occasion.
I'd like to identify these boys for you... so in case you find them prowling around your home some night... you'll know how to address them.
Mr. Nacio Herb Brown, the composer at the piano... and Mr. Arthur Freed, the lyricist... who also writes the words.
These two boys wrote...
Doll Dance, Broadway Melody...
You Were Meant For Me, the Pagan Love Song... and The Wedding of the Painted Doll.
It's a holiday
Today's the wedding of the painted doll
It's a jolly day
The news is spreading all around the hall
Red Riding Hood and Buster Brown
The Jumping Jack jumped into town
From far and near, they're coming here
Church bells ringing
Bringing all the little dollies
From the follies
With their painted cheeks
Little mama doll has fussed around for weeks and weeks
Shoo the blues, no time to lose
Bikes and shoes will spread the news
That it's a holiday
Today's the wedding of the little painted doll
I've come to the conclusion that it's a very simple matter to write a popular song.
Let's see how song writer Sammy Cahn feels about that.
Writing a song can be agony or ecstasy.
It can take half an hour or half a year.
But when anyone writes a song in a movie... there never seems to be any problem.
Inspiration turns on faster than a light bulb.
For instance... look how hard
Ann Sothern and Robert Young... have to struggle to write a song... which was written by
George and Ira Gershwin.
And lovely.
Hey, "Oh, sweet and lovely."
Oh, sweet and lovely, can it be true?
You are the one
Baby, be mine
Baby, be mine
Oh, sweet and lovely,
Baby, be mine
Baby, be good
Lady, be good
That's it, "Lady, be good."
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Yeah!
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
How's that?
I am so awfully misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me
...this feeling.
Lew Ayres, prodded by Al Shean... sets his love for Jeanette MacDonald to music.
You got something that hurts you, that's important, that means something.
Well, write it out. Put it in notes.
Orchestrate it.
Make the violins tell it, and the brasses.
You never lost Mary Hale.
You lost yourself.
You were like a bird that wouldn't fly, a fish that wouldn't swim... a musician that wouldn't write.
Speaking a woman's name night after night before you go to sleep... that's for nobodies, for weaklings.
But you, you got to sing out on them so she'll hear it... and no matter where she is, she'll hear her name in your music... and then she'll come back to you.
Although your tears may fall
Jimmy.
We won't be far apart
Summer journeys to Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town
We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
Now Mickey Rooney and Tom Drake show us... how Rodgers and Hart did it.
It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow to and fro
Fred Astaire and Red Skelton as Kalmar and Ruby.
I wouldn't write that song with you if you begged me.
Begged you? I didn't even ask you.
I guess you just can't help it, Harry.
I feel sorry for you.
Feel sorry for me?
You must think I'm just some...
I can tell you what I think of you in three little words.
You're a dope!
Three little words, "You're a dope."
You are a dope
In the film The Great Waltz...
Fernand Gravet as Johann Strauss... composedTales from the Vienna Woods... just by riding through the woods with Miliza Korjus.
Come on, my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie
That's entertainment
Good morning
Good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning
Good morning to you
When the band began to play
This is one of those terrific
Singin' in the Rain numbers... with Gene, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor having a ball.
So, good morning
Good morning
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning
Good morning to you and you and you and you
Good morning
Good morning
We've gabbed the whole night through
Good morning
Good morning to you
Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana
In the morning
In the morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning
Good morning to you
Might be just as iffy
If we was in Mississippi
When we left the movie show the future wasn't bright
But came the dawn the show goes on and I don't want to say good night
- So say good morning
- Good morning
Rainbows are shining through
Good morning
Good morning
Bonjour
Buenos Dias
Buongiorno
Guten Morgen
Good morning to you
Fred, Nanette Fabray, and Jack Buchanan... as a very young trio in this Schwartz and
Dietz number from Band Wagon.
Mrs. Wipple Poofer loves to talk to Mrs. Hildendorfer
Of the fatal natal day she had her silly Willy
Mrs. Hudson-Cooper loves to talk to Mrs. Golden-Wasser
Of her major operation when she had her twins
But when Mother comes along
She silences the others
She accomplished something that is very rare in mothers
MGM has got a Leo
But Mama has got a trio
She is proud but says three is a crowd
Oh, we do everything alike
We look alike
We dress alike, we walk alike
We talk alike, and what is more
We hate each other very much
We hate our folks
We're sick of jokes on what an art it is to tell us apart
We eat the same kind of vittles
We drink the same kind of bottles
We sit in the same kind of highchair highchair, highchair
I wish I had a gun
A real gun
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Fred, you remember those wonderful parties with Judy... where she'd get up and sing this song?
She first sang it to Margaret O'Brien in Meet Me in St. Louis.
Next year all our troubles will be miles away
Once again, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little
Christmas now
Stepping out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight
Here you are again, Fred, in Easter Parade.
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knocking wood
There'll be smooth sailing
'Cause I'm trimming my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes
And on my nails
Stepping out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight
What a fabulous bit of trick photography.
Please, Kelly. I don't tell your secrets.
Ten cents a dance
That's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Doris Day, belting out another great Rodgers and Hart tune... from Love Me or Leave Me.
Ten cents a dance
Dandies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown
7.;00 to midnight
I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes
Sometimes I think
I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy
Ten cents a dance
- I got
- Rhythm
- I got
- Music
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
I've always said,
"Just put Gene with a bunch of kids...
"and you're bound to come up with a winner. " Watch.
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Old man Trouble,
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
- Vous comprenez ca?
- Non!
- I got
- Rhythm
- I got
- Music
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Charlot!
Charlie Chaplin!
Aeroplane!
Who could ask for anything more?
More!
C'est tout!
Au revoir!
You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy
Then snap!
Those eyes, those sighs
They're part of the tender trap
After having sung with the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras...
Frank Sinatra made his solo debut... at the Paramount Theater in New York in December 1942.
They had to call out the police to control the crowds.
Especially his most avid fans, the bobbysoxers.
When he walked out on the stage... it was not merely the birth of a star... but the creation of a legend.
I'll walk alone
They'll ask me why
And I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
I'll walk alone
It was inevitable that the Sinatra hysteria would lead him to Hollywood... and equally inevitable... that producer Arthur Freed would choose him... to sing Kern and Hammerstein's classic. ;
OI' Man River.
OI'man river
That ol'man river
He must know somethin'
But he don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin'along
He don't plant taters
And he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em
Is soon forgotten
But ol'man river
Just keeps rollin'along
I fall in love too easily
There's something about a Sinatra ballad that makes it automatically unforgettable.
Here is young Blue Eyes singing one of my favorites from Anchors Aweigh.
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I believe
Frank sings to
Jimmy Durante and Billy Roy in. ;
It Happened in Brooklyn.
If you'll wish for the dream
By the wishing well
Don't tell the wish or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive
But that's what I believe
I don't care
High Society.
And it can't get much higher... than Frank serenading the future princess of Monaco.
'Cause you're sensational
Making love is quite an art
What you require is the proper squire to fire your heart
And if you'll say that one fine day
You'll let me come to call
We'll have a ball
'Cause you're sensational
Sensational
That's all
She argued
Fought like a wildcat
She threatened
Practically drew a gun on the boy
She said
"You can't send me home
- "Not like this"
- What happened?
She finally got her kiss
It seems only yesterday that I did this number with Frank.
That's when he taught me how to dance.
What a time we had tonight
What a dish, what a dream, what a dame
And she lives alone
I gets weary
And so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin'
But I'm feared of dyin'
And ol'man river
He just keeps rollin'
Along
Movie buffs and the rest
Have a line or scene they like best
The courtroom where a lawyer pleads for his client's life
A sleuth that's hot but cannot spot the gun or the knife
But you'll knock 'em flat with
"That's no lady, that was my wife"
They all last, unsurpassed
Here's the cast
Please let me stay.
But I want to be alone.
I just want to be alone.
We want to be alone.
But we want to be left alone.
Do you want to be alone, comrade?
No.
I don't know how you'll look tomorrow... but right now, you're the most beautiful dame in the world.
- You want to work with me?
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.
Shake.
- Yes, sir.
- Now beat it.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
Annual income £20.
Annual expenditure £19.
Result? Happiness.
Annual income £20.
Annual expenditure £21.
Result? Misery.
That advice is so far worth taking...
I have never taken it myself... and I am the miserable creature you behold.
Grand Hotel. Always the same.
People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.
I was reading a book the other day.
Reading a book?
Yes, it's all about civilization or something.
A nutty kind of a book.
Do you know the guy says... that machinery is going to take the place of every profession?
Oh, my dear.
That's something you need never worry about.
I'd like to run barefoot through your hair.
The picturesque impressions indelibly fixed in our memory.
It is time to conclude our visit... and reluctantly say farewell to Hong Kong... the hub of the Orient.
And as the midnight sun lingers on the skyline of the city... we most reluctantly say farewell to Stockholm...
Venice of the north.
And it is in this paradise of the Canadian Rockies... that we reluctantly say farewell to beautiful Banff.
With this thought, we most reluctantly say... farewell to the Taj Mahal.
We reluctantly say, farewell, colorful Guatemala.
We reluctantly conclude our visit to Japan.
Farewell to Ireland, the Emerald Isle.
Farewell to Switzerland.
Farewell Udaipur.
Farewell to all...
Farewell...
I am Tandaleo.
Jane. Tarzan.
Please stop.
Just walk natural, as if you were out for a stroll.
Not a word.
Hold it right there!
Where are you going with that elephant?
What elephant?
As soon as I saw you, I said to myself:
"There's a hot-looking little number."
Don't let it throw you, champ.
I'm 20 degrees cooler than you think.
Dames are just like traffic.
Sometimes you got to stop.
Sometimes you got to go.
Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs.
You see that chess game over there?
When I was 4 years old,
I played 10 people all at once... blindfolded.
I lost every game.
Lie down.
Stand up.
Grandpa, I love you.
Rosetta, I love you.
Tippy, I love you.
Honey, I love you.
Honey, I love you.
Kippy, I love you.
I love you, Duke.
What're you trying to do?
Steal my gag line?
To begin with, I took four years at Vassar.
Vassar? But that's a girls' college.
I found that out the third year.
I'd have been there yet, but I went out for the swimming team.
It's all right. That's in every contract.
That's what they call a sanity clause.
You can't fool me.
There ain't no Sanity Claus.
Hold me closer.
Closer.
I hold you any closer, I'd be in back of you.
It's a far, far better thing I do, than I have ever done.
It's a far, far better rest I go to... than I have ever known.
You're my Lassie come home.
But, Rhett, if you go... where shall I go? What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
What can I say about Paris that wouldn't be redundant?
Even people who have never been there know of its glories... from songs, books, movies, paintings... even cookbooks.
And thanks to the invention of film and records... there is one national treasure... who will live as long as all the others.
That's Paris.
City of girls and lights!
Maurice Chevalier.
Here he is, singing about his Paris, in one of his early films.
I'm going to Maxim 's
Where all the girls are dreams
Each kiss goes on the wine list
And mine is quite a fine list
Lolo, Dodo, Juju
Cloclo, Margot, Frufru
We promise to be faithful
Until the night is through
Let us gaze in the wine while it's wet
Let's do things that we'll live to regret
Let me dance till the restaurant whirls
With the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
Where there's wine and there's women and song
It is wrong not to do something wrong
When you do something wrong
You must do something right
And I'm doing all right tonight
You know...
I guess more songs have been written about Paris than any other city.
One of the loveliest and most poignant... was by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein.
Dinah Shore sings it in
Till the Clouds Roll by.
The last time I saw Paris her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears
The last time I saw Paris her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they change her
I'll remember her that way
Paris is called the City of Lights.
When these lights are turned on, it becomes the diamond of the world.
Lovers, of course... prefer the romantic shadows along the banks of the Seine.
Another famous Parisian landmark... but of a different kind.
We see Georges Guetary performing... in true Folies-Bergère style.
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm going to get there at any price
Stand aside, I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above, it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm going to get there at any price
Stand aside, I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above, it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
With a new step every day
The place du Trocadéro is one of my favorite places in Paris.
It's a great hangout for children who skate.
So I always bring my kids here to join me.
You know... a number on roller skates, that might not be a bad idea.
This is Montmartre... a very different section of the city.
As you see, the sidewalks are jammed with young artists plying their trade.
Montmartre is also world-renowned for its colorful cabarets.
The cancan, danced by Gwen Verdon and company.
Not far from Paris is Versailles.
One of the most beautiful palaces ever built.
A museum now, it's still used for special state dinners... and charity balls.
Some suggestion of a...
Bal de Versaille... was captured by Ernst Lubitsch in the picture The Merry Widow... filmed in 1934.
Gene dances in the cartoon
Then there's Bing,
He and Louis will croon
Bobby Van could jump over the moon
That's entertainment
You'll see Fred and Judy as tramps
Cyd plays one of those glamorous vamps
Howard Keel,
He'll sum up the whole deal
The world's a cartoon
A great big balloon of entertainment
Hey, Gene, you've had some very unusual dancing partners.
But these, from Invitation to the Dance, beat everything.
Well, you take some skins
Jazz begins
And you take a bass
Man, now we're gettin' someplace

We would swim up the avenue but we haven't any lake
So we'll walk up the avenue

There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
In Annie Get Your Gun...
Betty Hutton, Howard Keel, Keenan Wynn,
Louis Calhern, and company... tear the screen apart... with Irving Berlin's fabulous anthem to entertainment.
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feelin'
When you are stealin' that extra bow
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the
Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.
They starred in nine films together... and were, undoubtedly, the most successful dramatic team... in screen history.
Let's look at some of their work, together, and apart.
There, that's better. I'm Father Flanagan.
I saw your brother Joe just a little while ago.
We had a long talk about you, Whitey.
Joe wants you to come with me to Boys Town.
You've got a swell chance taking me to that joint.
Look, in a pinch,
I can be tougher than you are... and I guess, maybe, this is the pinch.
You're coming with me to Boys Town because that's what your brother wants.
And that's the way I want it.
Shorty, you mind backing up and letting me by?
Yeah, I do mind. Suppose you back up, and don't call me Shorty.
Shorty or sonny, what difference does it make?
Move over, bud.
I'm wearing Justin boots with 4-inch heels.
They'll sure make big dents in that little frame of yours.
Lady athlete, properly handled, always a market.
Always.
I don't think you've ever been properly handled.
That's right, not even by myself.
Very few brains.
- There's one thing I got to say, though.
- What?
Nicely packed, that kit.
Is, at that.
Not much meat on her, but what's there is cherce.
- Let's get out.
- Okay.
I told you already.
I ain't going to make no deals with you.
- Two against one.
- That's right, two against one... and that's how it is in this business, too, wise guy.
Two against one.
You want your usual percent?
My glasses.
That's no fair.
What's the big idea?
Where are my glasses?
- What is this?
- It's no fair.
Did you ever see a thing like this before?
We're so different, we could help each other, couldn't we?
- I mean, really help. That is, if we...
- What?
Don't rush me. Give me time.
- One, two, three...
- I've been thinking... all sorts of things in all ways.
Backwards, forwards, every which way, but chiefly forwards.
I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past.
Yes, and I've got to thinking maybe you're right.
It is stupid of me, it is selfish... but it is a terrible world to live in alone with just memories.
You've got qualities to face it and do something about it with.
Your eye is so clear. You see straight.
You're so honest, quick, aware, fearless, forthright, and...
- Wait a minute.
- Don't stop me.
I'm none of those, except maybe honest.
I've got qualities for it, too.
I'm strong and have lots of energy.
I'm brave, too. Things don't get me down, and I can take punishment.
It isn't just this house I can offer you or myself as an assistant.
After all we said to each other that night... the way we understand each other about love... you know I never could... and I know you never could or would want to... and then there's all that powerful commodity to be put to use.
- So I thought...
- You thought?
I wondered if you'd like to marry me.
What were you doing down in my bailiwick today?
- Just a little ambulance chasing.
- Successful?
- I got the case.
- What case?
A girl named Doris Attinger shot her husband. I'm going to defend her.
Now, when did you begin to suspect... that you were losing your husband's affection?
When he started batting me around.
Farewell, Amanda
What's the matter?
Don't you want your rub now? What...
What are you, sore about a little slap?
No.
- What then?
- You meant that, didn't you?
- You really meant that.
- No.
I can tell, I know your touch.
- I know a slap from a slug.
- Okay.
I'm not so sure it is.
I'm not so sure I care to expose myself... to typical, instinctive masculine brutality.
Come, now.
It felt not only like you meant it, but like you felt you had a right to.
I can tell.
What have you got back there, radar equipment?
All right.
Break it up.
Adam. Listen to me.
Don't you handle me, lady. I'm not nutty.
Adam, you're sick. Please.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Teaching a lesson.
Him first, then comes yours.
- Now get away, Amanda.
- Don't you do it.
Stop it, Adam. Stop it!
- You've no right.
- That's all I wanted to hear.
Licorice.
If there's anything I'm a sucker for, it's licorice.
- I figure you can take care of yourself.
- No, I can't.
- I bet you could even lick me.
- No, I couldn't.
- Sure. I think so.
- No, I couldn't.
- I need someone to look after me.
- What about me?
Why not?
I don't know if I can lick you or you can lick me...
- but I'll tell you one thing I do know.
- What?
- Together, we can lick them all.
- You bet.
And together they did... because everything about Tracy and Hepburn... was cherce.
Can it be
I like myself
She likes me
So, I like myself
If someone wonderful as she is can think I'm wonderful
I must be quite a guy
Gene, you finally did work out that number on skates, didn't you?
Yes, I guess I did... in a film dreamed up by Comden and Green... called It's Always Fair Weather.
Dislike myself
But now my love has got me ridin'high
She likes me, so, so do I
I can remember everything as if it were yesterday.
- We met at 9.;00
- We met at 8.;00
- I was on time
- No, you were late
Ah yes, I remember it well
Here's my favorite boulevardier with Hermione Gingold... and a lovely Lerner and Loewe song from Gigi.
I remember it well
That dazzling April moon!
There was none that night
And the month was June
That's right, that's right
It warms my heart
To know that you
Remember still
The way you do
Ah yes
I remember it well
- That carriage ride
- You walked me home
- You lost a glove
- I lost a comb
Ah yes, I remember it well
- That brilliant sky!
- We had some rain
- Those Russian songs
- From sunny Spain
Ah yes, I remember it well
You wore a gown of gold
I was all in blue
Am I getting old?
Oh, no not you!
How strong you were
How young and gay
A prince of love in every way
Ah yes
I remember it well
The last time
Ginger and I worked together... was in The Barkley's of Broadway.
I think this is one of the best routines you ever did.
Yes!
No picture about entertainment would be complete... without a number from wet and wonderful Esther Williams.
And she does it without trick photography.
A show that is really a show
Sends you out with a kind of a glow
And you say as you go on your way
That's entertainment
The art that appeals to the heart
Is a song that just has to belong
Or a dance that is sure to entrance
That's entertainment
And now may we pause
For a moment or two?
Because there's a chore that we feel we should do
We'd like to name just a few of the stars
You have seen here
Performing a song or scene here
There were
Judy Garland, Leslie Caron,
Greta Garbo, Doris Day
Bob Taylor, Jack Buchanan,
Tony Martin, Maurice Chevalier
Bing Crosby, Mickey Rooney,
Eleanor Powell, Nanette Fabray
That's entertainment
Clark Gable, Melvyn Douglas,
Bob Montgomery, John Barrymore
Hermione Gingold, Esther Williams,
Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore
- Franchot Tone, Greer Garson
- Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy
Roddy McDowall, Myrna Loy, and William Powell
Jeanette MacDonald, Debbie Reynolds,
Marge and Gower Champion
Ann Miller, Cary Grant, Ann Sothern,
Louis Armstrong, Bobby Van
Jean Harlow, Cyd Charisse,
Joan Crawford, Vivien Leigh, Tarzan
That makes forty-two
We've missed many who have entertained you
And if it's a hit, then they'll go on from there
They played a charade that was lighter than air
A good old-fashioned affair
As we sing this finale
We hope it was up your alley
No death like you get in Macbeth
No ordeal like the end of Camille
This goodbye brings a tear to the eye
The world is a stage
The stage is the world of entertainment
English
When the Second World War was over, we were the one great power in the world.
The Soviets had a substantial military machine, but they could not touch us in power.
We had this enormous force that had been built up.
We had the greatest fleet in the world.
We'd come through the war economically sound.
And I think that, in addition to feeling a sense of responsibility, we also began to feel... the-the sense of a world power, that possibly we could control the future of the world.
Our vision of progress is not limited to our own country.
We extend it to all the peoples of the world.
Military action in Indochina.
French regulars land along the coast in search of roving communist bands.
For France, it represents a tremendous sacrifice... of manpower and financial resources.
Without American help, the burden would be too great.
I do not expect that there is going to be a communist victory in Indochina.
I affirm that Secretary Dulles... offered me two atomic bombs.
Two, uh...
Neither one, neither three. Two.
If Indochina goes, several things happen right away.
The Accra Peninsula, the little bit of end hanging on down there... would be scarcely defensible.
The tin and the tungsten... that we so greatly value from that area would cease coming.
We don't see the end of the tunnel, but, uh, I must say...
I don't think it's darker than it was a year ago, in some ways lighter. Yes?
So we must be ready to fight in Vietnam, but the ultimate victory will depend upon the hearts... and the minds of the people who actually live out there.
Throughout the war in Vietnam, the United States has exercised a degree of restraint... unprecedented in the annals of war.
There was just one thing, one small word that enabled myself and my buddies... to stay alive those many years.
That one thing was faith.
Faith in my family, my God and my country.
I remembered high school.
I remembered playing sports there.
And I can remember my coach saying...
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going, because winners never quit and quitters never win."
Why did I go to Vietnam?
I will have to go back to 1965, when I was 22 years old.
At that time, communism was once again trying to muscle its way... into a free country.
That would assert that there's a majority of people in that country... that want to be communist.
Why do they need us then?
Because they were subjected to, uh, military attack from outside.
Uh, the, uh...
Are you really asking me this goddamn silly question?
- You really want me to go into this?
- Yes.
I mean... I mean, you know, we really got to go back to...
You just want me to go back to the origins of this thing then.
All right, I'll do it, but this is pretty pedestrian stuff, I must say, at this late stage of the game.
Honestly it is.
I'll do it. All right.
- There's disagreement about the origins.
- No, there's not.
No, there's not. There's no doubt.
All right, I'll answer your question, you can throw away that tape.
I didn't expect to have to go back to this kind of sophomoric stuff, but I'll do it.
The problem, uh, began, uh, in its present phase, after the Sputnik, the launch of the Sputnik in 1957, October.
This opened a phase of not well-coordinated, but universally optimistic and hopeful communist enterprise... in many parts of the world.
Renewed hostile actions... against United States ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin... have today required me to order military forces of the United States... to take action in reply.
We always hesitate in public to use the word "lie" but a lie is a lie.
I mean, it's a misrepresentation of fact.
And it's supposed to be a criminal act if its done under oath.
Mr. Johnson didn't say it under oath, he just said it.
We don't usually have the president under oath.
There are those who ask why this responsibility should be ours.
The answer, I think, is simple.
There is no one else who can do the job.
If necessary,
I am ready to go back.
We all must be ready.
You must have the political, economic and philosophical courage to send me... or do whatever you think is necessary.
I must be ready to go.
If I did well, it is only because Linden did well in bringing me up... and making me into a man.
If I served the military well, it is only because the military trained me to be a good officer.
If I am a good American, it is only because America brought me up to be a good American.
- Three, two, one...
It was a sight to touch the heart of the most callous.
Lieutenant George Coker was back in
Linden, New Jersey, the hero of the day.
Three thousand people turned out to greet him. Schools were closed... and streets were blocked as the young former prisoner of war... walked on a red carpet to the steps of city hall.
Mike is still open. Two, one...
I'm from Duncan, Oklahoma, which is about 90 miles south of here.
And, uh, and I lived around several places... uh, Missouri, Chicago,
Detroit, uh, Germany,
Uh... by the time I got out of high school, I was very conservative.
We have, in Duncan high school... we bought... the high school had bought a, uh...
Excuse me... a John Birch package on communism.
So we studied communism via the John Birch Society, the big red map with the flowing out of the disease and so forth, and-and learned how Karl Marx was a very cruel man... and used to, uh, make his family suffer and so forth.
Uh, so when I got out of high school,
I thought basically that, um,
Teddy Roosevelt's what this country needed, and F.D.R. had kind of sold us down the drain to the commies.
The communist conspiracy is a deliberate and predictable plan of action... to subvert the world.
Mosinee, Wisconsin, in a unique Mayday object lesson, shows what could happen here if communism took over.
The unyielding chief of police is liquidated by American Legionnaires... portraying Red trigger men.
A grim demonstration of what subversion could lead to,
Mosinee's Mayday serves as a sharp warning to all democratic communities.
It's an international, criminal conspiracy.
Before we know it, we're gonna turn our backs around someday, the whole United States, we're gonna turn around and see nothing but V. C... or not V.C., but communism... we're gonna turn around and say, "What happened?"
People just walking in with riots, drugs, you name it.
They're tearing us down from the inside out.
In 1917, when the communists overthrew the Russian government, there was 1 communist for every 2,277 persons... in Russia.
In the United States today, there is one communist... for every 1,814 persons in this country.
If we lose Indochina, Mr. Jenkins, we will lose the Pacific, and we'll be an island in a communist sea.
- Go ahead, how does it go?
- Oh, mother.
I swear that I am not now... or ever have been a member of the communist party.
Feel better?
Of course, when it gets down to communism, uh,
I've been fighting communism since 1951, actually.
I was looked at, you know, the American fighting man, as being, uh, you know, like a warrior of sorts, you know, due to my background, the way my mother brought me up.
She always spoke of the warrior societies of our tribe... and of the different tribes around us and how that these men... always had to work to gain the respect of the people around them... and how they had to live, uh, more or less a life dictated to them... by the society that they belonged to, and it was extremely hard.
I-I looked around and from listening to my uncles and a lot of my relations... they had been in the Marine Corps... and they always told me that... the Marine Corps was the hardest service to cope with physically and mentally.
And I naturally wanted to be the best at that time, and I looked at the Marine Corps as being the elite of the elite, the warrior society in the United States.
Now it might sound cliché-ish to say that,
"My country, may it always be right, but right or wrong, my country."
But that's how I felt back in '67.
And during my senior year,
I said I've got an obligation to serve.
I've got to fulfill it.
There's no reason physically why I would be exempted, and therefore, I'm gonna enlist.
- What you got there?
- Picture.
Picture? How much picture?
- Three thousand?
- I go beaucoup hungry. I sell 3,000.
- You go here, too much money.
- I buy watch for 1,500.
No, you sell to me?
You lie. You lie, you die.
- You give massage? What else you give?
- Yes.
Huh?
- I buy you one beer, okay?
- You-You buy me one beer?
No, no. No money.
Go home, mama-san.
Please, go home, mama-san.
No. Go home, mama-san.
No. Go home, mama-san.
Okay? No. Go home, mama-san.
- You will like.
- No. No.
Huh?
- How much?
- One thousand.
You? Ah, it's too much. Beaucoup.
Yeah, for sure. No, no good.
We thought of ourselves, I think, as trying to defeat communists.
Defeat... Accepting a view of, uh... the Walt Rostow kind of view... of covert aggression of some kind.
The kind of view that enabled you to think of the conflict... in, really, World War II terms.
That was an unquestioned assumption.
It had an idealistic flavor to it, but it was the underpinning of an imperial policy, basically.
I shared the assumption, very easily, and felt it as an idealistic one really.
We were doing something for them.
I recall that I was in the
New York area at the time, and I stopped by to see General MacArthur, who I had known for several years.
Uh, when he greeted me, he made, uh, quite a prophetic statement.
He said, "Westmoreland,
I-I see you have a new job."
He said, "I hope you appreciate that this new assignment... is filled with opportunities, but fraught with hazards."
And indeed, uh, this was a prophetic statement.
It can be described much like, uh... a-a-a singer doing an aria... that's totally into what he's doing, you know, totally feeling it.
He knows the aria, and he's experiencing the aria.
And he knows his limits, and he knows whether he's doing it and doing it well.
Flying an aircraft can be a great deal like that.
What's a race driver feel like?
Why does a guy want to drive in the Indianapolis 500?
I guess, perhaps, the risk of dying, being killed is part of it that makes it thrilling.
I can tell when the aircraft feels right, when it's about to stall.
I can tell when I cant pull another fraction of a pound... or the airplane will stall, flip out and spin on me.
I would follow a pathway on something like a TV screen in front of me... that would direct me right, left or center... follow the steering, keep the steering symbol, uh, centered.
I'd see a little attack light when we'd stepped into attack.
I could pull the "commit" switch on my stick, and the computer took over.
A computer figured out the ballistics, the airspeed, the slant range... and dropped the bombs when we got to the appropriate point, in whichever kind of attack we'd selected, whether it was flying straight and level or tossing our bombs out.
So it was very much of a technical expertise thing.
I was a good pilot, you know.
I had, uh, uh,
I had a lot of pride in my ability to fly.
You're up there doing something that, uh, mankind has only dreamed of; the flying, especially at night, in an aircraft.
The A-6 is one of the few that can really do it the way we did it.
Um, a World War II aviator would not even dream of doing the things we did.
It's definitely the ultimate in aviation.
Almost everybody has blown off firecrackers.
The thrill you get when you see something explode as a child, or even as an adult almost.
You put something in the can and watch the can blow up in the air.
And the excitement, the sense of excitement, especially if you're getting shot at, is just incredible.
You get there, have a real good mission, hit your target, find out later your target was totally destroyed, that it wasn't one of these misses or almost, you got it.
And come back and make a night carrier landing recovery. Uh, that's fantastic.
To say it's thrilling, yes, it's deeply satisfying.
The planes again.
Are they American or Vietnamese?
I don't know whose they are. Just airplanes.
What was this here?
I used to raise pigs here, right there.
Where was the kitchen?
The kitchen was here.
They built it with bricks.
This was the floor.
And this was for the heat.
What's that?
That is the bomb crater.
The bombs dropped there and destroyed everything I had.
An older sister died, and I've another older sister left.
Yes, there were just the three of us.
But then one died.
And I'm supposed to live in a house over there.
But now it's just a heap of rubble.
How old was your sister?
Seventy-eight.
What did she die of?
Bombs. Bombs were dropped here the other day, and they killed her.
I'm so unhappy.
My sister died and I've got no home left.
I've moved in with my sister here.
I've been wounded.
I can't do anything for a living now.
I'm old and weak.
I've got nothing to sell.
Nothing to do.
Mm.
You really just don't have time for personal thoughts... when you're up there flying around at 500, 600 miles an hours.
You might call it an electronic war in a certain way.
I didn't have time to think about anything else.
If you wanted to later, you might.
But it was all business.
It's, um, just strictly professionalism.
We had a job to do and we did it.
Never could see the people.
You never could see...
Occasionally you saw the houses when you were bombing around a village... or bombing in a village.
Uh, you never heard the explosion.
You never saw any blood or any screams.
It was very clean.
You're doing a job.
You're an expert at what you do.
I was a technician.
Everything just collapsed under the bombs.
Everything just caved in.
It's like a bird and its nest.
The way things are with the house in the rubble, the bird comes home and finds no nest.
Where am I to find a place to sit and work for something to eat?
Even a bird needs a nest it can go back to, crawl into for sleep and food.
Look, they're focusing on us now.
First they bomb as much as they please, then they film.
We fought against the
Chinese for 12 centuries.
We fought against the French for 100 years.
And finally, when the war was lost by the French in 1954... at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, the Vietnamese were liberated from foreign oppression.
But it was at that precise moment that the Americans came to Vietnam.
Little by little at first.
Then more and more as an invasion, an invasion of the American army.
Five hundred thousand of them in Vietnam.
And this war became a war of genocide.
The people of North Vietnam and South Vietnam... fight only for freedom, independence and national unity.
This war is a war against the American imperialists.
This is our war for independence.
What we are trying to put across this afternoon is to get you to realize... that these weren't mythical, hazy people from the past.
These were very real people.
When they rose up against the most powerful army in the world, they were actually putting everything on the line that they had:
Their homes, their wealth, their past and their future.
That all men are created equal.
That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
And when you judge the Revolution and the problems and the success we had, it was a two-way street.
A good many citizens at the time of the Revolution... actually stayed and fought with the British.
It was close to being a civil war in many areas.
You actually split many-many families.
Thomas Jefferson said,
"The tree of revolution is..." or "The tree of liberty is... watered by the blood of revolution every generation."
And I think that's a little exaggerated, but there's some truth to that.
The war had come to Westchester County, but so too had independence and a new responsibility.
Men are getting killed, men are killing. That's the parallel.
As far as politics, are you kidding?
Oriental politics?
Don't put me on, man.
Fire!
We haven't found his weapon yet.
We're still looking for it.
- You got a weapon?
- No, sir.
He had one, man.
This guy's got ammo.
I'm planning to medivac this guy.
The people who are living in the jungle, under the bombs, without pay, without their families, are doing so because they are fighting for independence.
Because they're fighting, in this case, for unification... and they're fighting for revolution.
Of course, the name for a conflict... in which you're opposing a revolution is counter-revolution.
And this is something we never admitted to ourselves at all.
It's-It's what we were really doing.
The letters and the reports we had... on Ho Chi Minh's attitude back in 1946... he wrote I think it was seven letters to this government and received no reply.
The-The-The pathos, almost, the sadness...
Here's a man who felt and believed the United States... would be sympathetic to his purpose of gaining his independence... from a colonial power.
And then to find we...
You know, this is what he'd read.
He'd been here, read our Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
He thought surely the United States would be interested.
We had testimony in the committee that his one worry... was that it was so insignificant...
Vietnam was so far away, insignificant... we would never bother about it.
It's too small to ever attract the attention of the United States.
He was sure in his own mind... that if we ever put our minds in focus upon it, we would be for him.
How different history would have been for us and for them... if we had felt a common interest... in the colonial province like Vietnam... seeking its independence from France.
The Ho Chi Minh of '56,
I don't think could have got elected dogcatcher in South Vietnam.
Ho Chi Minh, uh, dead...
Could beat any candidate we've ever put up in Vietnam.
You asked me about my oldest son Bing.
He was a graduate of Harvard, 1965.
And he was not a soldier at heart.
Uh, but he realized,
I'm sure, there's no question, he realized he was part of a big job that had to be done, and he was gonna do it the way he did everything... full out.
And he went out on this mission...
Minh River... and it was a big assault mission bringing elements... to this area just south of Da Nang along the railroad line.
And they encountered heavy, sustained, uh, automatic weapons fire.
And the helicopter ahead of him,
I believe, was, uh, uh, destr... was shot down.
And then he went in and his helicopter was, uh, uh...
He was actually killed in flight.
That's what they...
And the airplane crashed, and he and his co... He was killed.
His copilot was very badly injured.
And I think there were 12 out of
15 or 16 of the people aboard... were either killed or badly hurt.
Many bombs, many coffins.
These are for children.
Eight or nine hundred a week.
I have lost seven children myself.
Many have died here.
It's nothing like in the countryside.
Many more have died there.
In the country, there are no coffins.
There's no money to buy them.
How did all the children die?
Poison. Poison, you know.
These planes keep spouting and spraying the stuff, and so many people have died.
It seems to destroy their intestines.
With this spraying and bombing, so many have died.
Each day, right on time, the bomb craters appear.
Hundreds of tons are dropped each day.
And we can't talk about it.
We can't talk about it... because we are afraid of the government.
Come on.
- You look nice.
- How do you feel?
What'd you do?
Uh, shaved.
I liked it better long.
So what you been doing?
In little more than a week,
I'll be going back to the military.
You what?
- Why?
- Well...
After what they've done to you?
Well, it's... it's a choice between that... or, uh, Canada, again.
Or, uh, staying underground.
Which is, uh, as you know, impossible...
- Have you been in contact with them?
- No.
No. But I've got a lot of support.
You'll get the same deal
Mike's getting.
It's going to be a different type thing.
I'm going back publicly.
We're having, uh,
Ad Hoc Congressional Hearings.
Yeah?
It's really been building up over the past couple of months.
- And...
- Am I going to be able to be there?
Of course you're going to be there. I'm gonna try to get Ronnie there, too.
"Cause you know what
I feel about the army.
These people holding their heads high because they lost a son... in Vietnam or something.
I don't think that's much to be proud of.
They've lost more than they'll ever gain for the rest of their lives.
And I remember I was sitting at the base of the hill, and I was on one of the tanks.
And I had an M-16, and I had stacks of magazines.
And there were two guys, you know, that were going through, like, some grass and bam!
I dinged in on one of 'em, and I nailed him, you know.
And the Aussie with me confirmed, you know, that I dinged him.
And I felt good. And I wanted more.
And it wasn't that I wanted more for politics or anything like that.
No. I couldn't of cared if they were whatever.
I just wanted them because they were the opposition, the enemy.
Stinking little savages.
Wipe 'em out, I say.
Wipe 'em out.
Wipe 'em off the face of the earth!
Will we ever understand these Eastern races?
Hit me, Poon Soon.
You hideous yellow monster!
I wanted to go out and kill some gooks, you know?
I-I really... I-I don't know. I guess
I had been totally brainwashed, because I could remember when people used to call me "blanket ass"... or "chief" and they still did, you know?
I think my name was, uh,
Ira Hayes in boot camp.
Either Ira Hayes or squaw, depending on what mood the drill instructor was in.
But there I was, you know, saying
I wanted to go kill some gooks.
They were instructed to remove the eyes of the individual... and place them in a hole in the middle of the back, and that would say to the
Vietnamese, you have to understand, uh, that whoever did that was ubiquitous.
In other words, the eye being the symbol of ubiquity, uh, or of all-present, all-powerfulness on the part of the Saigon government.
Which is an easy message for the local villagers to get.
In fact, the American advisors didn't have that much of a stomach for it.
So they used to use CBS logos.
You know, the eye of CBS?
And they would kill the individual and then they would leave him... with kind of a calling card on him.
At one point, I was invited to go along on an airborne interrogation... in a helicopter with the marines northwest of Da Nang.
And they took along two Vietnamese.
And one was already reduced by beatings with a rubber hose... and some other methods of, uh, beating and torture... to the point where he couldn't talk, he couldn't respond.
As an example to the one they wanted to question, they'd say,
"If you don't tell us what we want to know, we're gonna throw you out of the helicopter."
And, uh, he couldn't respond.
He didn't understand.
They were using, uh, pigeon Vietnamese, which he didn't understand.
It was more English than Vietnamese.
They'd run him up to the helicopter... two hefty E.M. were along... they'd take him by each elbow and run him up to the door of the helicopter.
They'd do this three or four times.
He was reduced to whimpering and crying.
And they finally, um, uh, told him that this was the last run.
He still responded the same way, and they winged him out of the helicopter.
The second fellow immediately started to babble.
Anything he could tell them.
Any kind of information he could give them for one goal.
And that was to reach the ground alive again.
I just can't see in my mind somebody throwing somebody out of a helicopter.
I don't believe this kind of stuff happened. Maybe it did. I don't know.
I never saw it, put it that way.
I've seen G.I.'s get mad and, uh, uh, rather than shoot one of these dinks, uh, just punch him right out, yeah, with his hands.
Americans say Vietnamese are just slant-eyed savages.
The Vietnamese have
5,000 years of history.
We fight against the invaders.
It is not we who are the savages.
I don't know where they are.
That's the worst thing.
Right around and run into the sewers and the gutters, anywhere.
They can be anywhere. Just hopin' you can stay alive from day to day.
I just want to go back home and go to school. That's about it.
- Have you lost any friends?
- Quite a few.
We lost one the other day.
The whole thing stinks.
The dude in the foxhole with me, he was dead.
And, like, here come the jets.
Everybody's, "Yay, jets! Do it to 'em.
Get these motherfuckers off our ass." You know.
'Cause they were diggin' in our behind real good.
And, like, the jet came in and "Yay, jet, get 'em."
And you see 'em swoopin' all around.
"Yay, jet, get 'em."
And he came over that way and let it go, and you say, "Uh-oh."
And you could see it's napalm cannister, because you can tell 'em.
They spin asshole over head, backwards as they're tumbling through the air.
And the thing is just tumbling down.
You know it's coming right at you.
You know. And, like, wow. The napalm hit, I grabbed this dude, just put him up over my head in the hole like that.
Fuckin' napalm went down the whole line.
Just creamed everybody in the line.
Thirty-five dudes, man, just burnt.
Post-toasty to the bitter, you dig?
And that napalm was just drippin' on both sides of this dude.
He's dead, you know. I'm just holdin' him up, using him as a shield.
I just chunked this dude off of me and just sprung out of the hole.
I didn't know which way I was going outside of back, you dig?
And just ran through.
Burned my pants off.
Spent the rest of the battle running with no drawers. My stuff hanging out.
You ever try to fight a battle without any drawers on, man?
Awful sick of it.
I'll be so glad to go home.
I don't know. It's the worst area we've been in since I've been in Vietnam.
You think it's worth it?
Yeah. I don't know. They say we're fighting for something. I don't know.
I was at a very kind of sobering thing last night.
Memorial service for four men in the second squadron... who were killed the other day.
One of them being a medic.
And, uh, the place was just packed.
And we sang three hymns and had a nice prayer.
I turned around, looked at their faces, and they were...
I was just proud.
My-My, uh, feeling for America... just soared because of their...
The way they looked.
They looked determined... and-and-and reverent at the same time.
But still they're a bloody good bunch of killers.
"When you go forth to war against your enemies... and see horses and chariots in an army larger than your own, you shall not be afraid."
Well, let's not anybody be so naive as to think we're here, in any way, to worship football.
Nor are we here, as I'm sure many people believe, to pray for a victory.
We believe in victory.
We believe it will come to the team that's best prepared.
This is serious business that we're involved in.
And that's religious, and God cares.
There are going to be men made tonight.
And that's religious, and God cares about that.
We're concerned about the big game.
But we're also concerned about the bigger game, the biggest game of all that surrounds us: The game of life.
May you be winners.
Winners in the big game.
But even more importantly, winners in the biggest game of all, which we all play. Let us pray.
That's a touchdown.
Because we got our kids geared to crack like hell.
Holding, number 37.
You got to tell them they're number one, no matter what.
- You're number one.
Wow. Why don't you just say "wow"?
- Say what?
- 'Toy hoy" means "wow"?
- Toy hoy?
- Yeah.
Like, toy hoy means, like, wow, you know?
- Look at the hickeys I gave this chick.
- You gave her hickeys?
- Yeah.
- I can imagine. Where?
Uh, one on each side.
- It's a place where she can't hide 'em.
- Oh, really?
See, this one? I gave her this one.
And this one, this is the first one right there.
It came out kind of nasty, you know.
- And... No can do, I know.
- Maybe he's dead.
- He's not dead. Wake him up.
- No can wakey up.
Why?
- Wakey him up. He no hard.
- Huh? Why he's no hard?
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause you no wake him up.
Hey, Charles.
You getting anything out of yours?
This one's, uh, kind of sour on me, you know? Uh...
- Well, keep her going, man.
- Huh?
- Keep her going.
- I'm trying to.
You know what it is about these chicks down here, like, they're, uh...
Well, what would you want to do... except for, you know, have a ball with them.
- And, uh... Right?
- Right.
You're number one.
This one's got a set of knockers, man.
This one does, too, but she won't take her goddamn bra off.
Take it off for her.
Take it off for her?
- That's the name of the game.
- Here, you don't want this.
I know. I know what you want.
- Hey. Hey, Charles. Charles.
- What?
Yeah? It's about time.
Ah, you don't be mad at me, okay?
It took you long enough, you know that?
- Oh, yeah. Check it out, baby.
- Check it out later, man.
Check it out later? Mm!
You know, if my chick at home could see this now, man, she'd flip.
One more. Yeah, this man here.
Hurry up down that tunnel.
Let's make a quick check and let's go.
Okay, well, hurry it up and check it out quickly.
Some people enjoy it, some don't.
Some just go out and do it as a job.
It's a daily grind.
- What is it for you?
- I enjoy it.
Now I know that he will have a very important message for each one of us, so I want you all to listen very attentively... to what he has to say to you.
- Lieutenant Coker.
- If you ever have to go to a war, and unfortunately, someday you probably will have to fight a war, you'll find out that life becomes very simple.
Because the only thing you're concerned about is living and dying.
Everything else is unimportant, because suddenly your life is at stake.
And that's what it's like to be when you become a prisoner, particularly, a prisoner of war.
Because the thing that got us through were the things we learned... before we were ten years old.
I'd like to open up to questions now.
Just raise your hand or yell it out and you can ask any question you want.
And I'll do the best I can to answer them.
How did you feel when the Vietnam war was over?
How did I feel when the war was over?
I felt real good. Real good.
It was a long war and a very difficult war to understand.
But the reason we went there was to win this war.
I volunteered to go.
I'd go again if I had to.
And we wanted to win.
That was our number one ambition.
That's what we really wanted, was to win this war.
And it took us a long time.
So when we knew that we had won, we felt great; we really felt great.
- What did Vietnam look like?
- What did Vietnam look like.
Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty.
Uh, the people over there are very backward and very primitive.
And they just make a mess out of everything.
How did you... How did you, um...
What do you feel about the people that, um, went and burned their draft cards and went into Canada?
We don't agree with them. I think these people were legally wrong.
I think sometimes they were cowards.
If they wanted to leave and go to Canada, that's okay.
But they can't come back, though, because they have disagreed.
They say, "We don't like your country, we don't like your people."
They're saying that to you and me.
"I don't like you, so I'm leaving."
Well, fine, that's okay. There's no reason to hate a guy for that.
'Cause that's also his right, but he can't come back.
Instead of helping and aiding the Vietnamese people,
I saw that we were party to their deliberate and systematic destruction.
The Vietnamese were considered, less than humans, inferiors.
We called them "gooks," "slopes."
Their lives weren't worth anything to us because we'd been taught to believe... that they were all fanatical and that they were all V. C... or V.C. sympathizers, even the children.
Many of us, however, began to understand... through our personal experiences in Vietnam... the depth of the lies and deceptions practiced upon us, and the American people, by our country's leaders.
It was they who trained us to kill without question... and to hate our enemy... the Vietnamese.
They concocted such phrases as "kill ratios", "search and destroy",
"free fire zones",
"secure areas", and so on... to mask the reality of their combat policy in Vietnam.
I make no apology for this act of resistance.
I could do nothing else at the time.
But underground life has become intolerable to me.
So I'm here today to draw attention to the true facts concerning my case... and the cases of tens of thousands just like me.
We are not criminals to be hunted and imprisoned.
Over a half million of us have deserted the military since 1965.
Most of us have already returned to the military... to be punished with jail and bad discharges... that will be carried around for the rest of our lives.
And it is a supreme irony to be prosecuted by the very same men... who planned and executed a genocidal war in Indochina.
Now, inside this hearing room,
Eddie Sowders has surrendered himself.
Urged on, he says, by a hand-to-mouth underground existence... that still nags at many of his fellow deserters... who continue to look over their shoulders.
Paul Udell, NBC News, Washington.
- How was your sound?
- One more time.
Let me respectfully tell the American people... that this is their dirtiest and longest war.
The Vietnamese fight only in self-defense.
Ultimately, the Americans will see the light.
If not, they will defeat themselves.
You know, Vietnam, uh, reminded me of a... of a child, the developing of a child.
The laws of nature control the development of this child.
A child has to sit up before it crawls.
It has to crawl before it walks.
It has to walk before it runs.
No matter how many decades America fights,
I'm telling you so that you will go back and repeat it to President Nixon.
Over here, as long as there is rice to eat, we'll keep fighting.
And if the rice runs out, then we'll plow the fields and fight again.
I know very little about it over there, I'll tell ya.
And the less I know, the better off I'll be.
It has not affected me a whole lot.
I mean, the American...
The way of life is still here.
And if you work for it, it's there for you.
We're taught that we're to obey our government, and I would have to go if I was instructed to.
Once in a while, I think about it, but I like to think about the things that are happening right now to me.
I don't it's affected mine at all.
I don't even know who we're fighting for over there, to be real honest with you.
I think we're fighting for the North Vietnamese, ain't we?
I fled from Dau Tien to go live in Suoi Dua.
Then I was allowed to go back, and I went back... and stayed in Ben Chua.
While I was in Ben Chua, trouble broke out again.
So I was taken up to Co Tach.
I was picked up again and sent to Ben Chua... to be lumped together with the others.
My house burned down while I was away.
Once more, I got sent to Co Tach.
I've fled five, six, at least seven times already.
The lives of my countrymen are worth no more than that of a fly.
You take it and swat it dead... just like that.
Ladies, listen to me.
There were some women amusing themselves and one pushed the other onto a table.
The lady's falsies broke the table in two.
If a table breaks, think of what would happen to a man's face.
Watch it, they're filming.
Don't joke.
People in America will think we're ridiculous.
We have about 15 companies now, including an insurance company and a tractor company.
We are in the hotel business, in the travel agency business.
We are the exclusive dealer for Ford in the country, Ford cars.
Oh, many, many other things, like, uh, an oil company in the forming.
We, uh, have a bottling company.
In other words, uh, we greatly... we greatly believe in the future of this country, and, uh, we think there's a great future for Vietnam.
And, uh, we think that Vietnam will be liveable, will not go communist, because otherwise, all these companies will go to waste.
And the way we work is we take a calculated risk.
If we don't lose South Vietnam within the next three to five years, then nobody can catch up with us.
I'm a Johnny-come-lately as far as war profiteering is concerned.
Uh, the reason why I... uh, organized this group of companies is because when I was in Paris,
I saw that peace was coming, whether we liked it or not.
Therefore, I got home in order to prepare for peace.
All these companies have been organized in order to prepare for peace... and prepare for the economic takeoff that will come with peace.
We have the infrastructure of hotels, of travel agencies and things like that.
But, of course, there are no tourists in Vietnam now. But there will be.
And, uh, we are getting ready for that sort of thing.
Does it feel comfortable?
Keep it flat. Just like you do with your good leg.
Now try to walk.
Well, it really isn't that much.
We were just walking and...
We were walking on a patrol and, uh, we ran into an ambush.
About six, seven guys really got hurt.
Ran into a battalion ambush, they said it was.
And it was supposed to be one of the biggest ambushes of Tet season.
And we called in two or three medivacs, and they got hit.
So, finally, the last one came in and got us out.
From that, I never saw any of the others
I was with, except for one or two.
And that was about it.
Most of the guys I keep in touch with are guys in the hospital.
They usually have a reunion once a year.
That's about it. There's really not that much to talk about.
Here we are for one thing that we said, and I don't give a shit now.
I don't care about the football game now.
I don't care about anything now.
The one thing that we wanna show these bastards with Masillon pride... is that we come down and show
'em a great Masillon effort.
And what the piss you doing?
What are ya doing?
Get going! Goddamn it, Tony!
Don't let 'em beat us!
Don't let 'em beat us!
Let's go! Show 'em Masillon pride.
- Come on! Go!
- Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Get him! Get him!
Make no mistake about it.
I don't want a man in here...
To go back home thinking otherwise.
We are going to win.
Go, motherfucker! Go!
Since the Lunar New Year, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese have proved they are capable... of bold and impressive military moves... that Americans here never dreamed could be achieved.
Whether the Vietcong can sustain this onslaught long remains to be seen, but whatever turn this war now takes, the capture of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon for seven hours... will be a story to rally and inspire the Vietcong.
Don North, ABC news, at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.
I know that, as was the case in the
Battle of the Bulge in World War II, that after the enemy exposed himself, we would defeat him.
He would be weakened, and we could follow that up.
Through the use of, uh, the maximum military force that we could bring to bear on him, through the bombing, through the mining of the harbors, through the cutting of his lines of communication, by moving in and cleaning out his sanctuaries, the enemy would have no choice... but to come to some accommodation.
In the beginning of 1968,
General Westmoreland needed
206,000 more troops.
We met hour after hour after hour in the Pentagon.
And I started in and asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
"How long do you think that we'll still be in the war?"
None of them knew.
"Uh, do you think that the
206,000 men will be enough?"
Nobody knew.
"Uh, might we have to send more men?" "Well, possibly."
"Well, in six months?"
"We don't know."
"A year? Eighteen months?"
I couldn't get answers to these questions.
By the end of that four-day interrogation,
I was getting down... by the end of it... into very serious questions,
"Do any of you men, as you look at it objectively, do you find any diminution in the will of the enemy to fight?"
Well, they said,
"No, we guess we don't."
"Are they sending the same number of men down through the Ho Chi Minh trail?"
"Well, yes, and even they might be a little more."
"And how about our bombing? We've placed great reliance on our bombing.
Is our bombing stopping them?"
"No."
"Well, what is the amount of attrition that our bombing's causing?"
"Well, maybe 10 to 15 percent."
So I remember asking one question.
"If a North Vietnamese field commander in South Vietnam needed 1,000 men..."
They said, "Yes."
"If he asked for, say, 1,200 men, 1,000 would get through?"
"Well, that's right."
'then he'd have the thousand he needed." "Well, yes. That's so."
Well, this type of interrogation...
Finally, by the end of four or five days,
I must say that my thinking... had undergone a very substantial revolution.
Come on, everybody!
As long as the
American President... is commander in chief... of the biggest war machine in human history, with bases on every continent, we are going to get into trouble.
Our enemy is the growing militarization of American life.
Our enemy is American imperialism.
And there is an awakening.
The enemy was on the ropes after the Tet offensive was over.
And it's like two boxers in the ring.
One boxer has the other one on the ropes, but the man who is about to be the victor... has his second throw the towel in.
Accordingly,
I shall not seek... and I will not accept... the nomination of my party for another term as your president.
I don't think we helped 'em one bit.
All I think we've done is destroyed their country, laid it waste.
No. I don't think we helped 'em.
As fellow human beings, I don't think they should be there doing that.
Certainly a mature person can say they made a mistake.
Why can't a government?
You let us all go off to war and said,
"Yea, team. Fight in Vietnam," and all this kinda shit in 1965 through 1968.
Now 1968 comes along and "Boo, team.
Come on home," and all this shit.
"And don't say nothin' about it, 'cause we don't want to hear about it...
'cause it's upsetting around dinnertime."
Well, Goddamn. It upset me for a whole goddamn year.
It upset a lot of people to the point where they're fuckin' dead, you know?
All this shit. You don't wanna hear about it? I'll tell you every day.
Make you sit out and puke on your dinner, you dig?
Because you got me over there, and now you done brought me back here... and you wanna forget it so somebody else can go do it somewhere else.
Hell no. Uh-uh.
You gonna hear it all.
Every day as long as you live, because it's gonna be with me as long as I live.
When I get up in the morning, when John gets up, when a lot of dudes sitting here get up, man, their gut hurts because they got shot there.
I gotta put on an arm and a leg, 'cause it ain't there no more, you dig?
Now, my man's got a hole in his stomach.
He can't work right, you know?
You do something about that.
Make that all disappear, you dig?
Make it all go away with the 6:00 news.
Turn it off or switch it to another channel.
Uh-Uh. To hell with that, you dig?
It's here and it's for real.
And it's gonna happen again unless these folks get off their ass... and realize it has happened.
The country is ready to pass a reasoned judgment on this war.
The people have judged, I think, that it's unwise and immoral... and not in the national interest of this country... and that, therefore, it must be brought to an end.
For 20 years, first the French, and then the United States... had been predicting victory in Vietnam.
In 1961 and in 1962, as well as 1966 and 1967, we have been told that the tide is turning, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, we can soon bring our troops home, victory is near, the enemy is tiring.
Once, in 1962,
I participated in such a prediction myself.
But for 20 years, we have been wrong.
The history of conflict among nations... does not record another such lengthy and consistent chronicle of error... as we have shown in Vietnam.
I had just given the policy line, stayed up all night with
Adam Walinsky and Peter Edelman, helping on a speech for Robert Kennedy... which proved to be his last speech given in San Francisco here... to a businessman's luncheon on Vietnam.
Uh, I went up with some corrections last thing in the morning... and shook hands with him in his bathrobe as he stood there.
And then he came down from the
Ambassador Hotel and got into a car.
We were struck with how easy it was to get onto that floor... and approach him at that point.
At the conference on lessons on Vietnam, of course, in the morning I learned that Robert Kennedy had died.
Well...
So...
So, uh...
Well, that was a way for a lot of people to feel powerless.
So, um, it began to look as if there was no way to change this country.
We'd been going down this road for so many years, and I had felt so strongly before that this was the right policy, that it was difficult for me to change.
I know now that the domino theory was a false theory.
I know now that we should not have become involved.
As far as I'm concerned today, I have no hesitancy whatsoever... in saying I could not have been more wrong... in my attitude toward Vietnam.
Ground combat, Vietnamese cross of gallantry with a silver star, gallantry in ground combat, four air medals, an "I was there" ribbon.
I got a colonel that's flying upstairs, and he's gettin' down on me... and he's saying, 'take the hill, take the hill, take the hill."
So I got together with the tank commander... and I said,
"Look, let's take three tanks... and we'll walk the A.R.V.N.
Up the hill, you know?
And we'll lay down a base of fire as we're going."
He says, "Okay." I got with the
A.R.V.N. And says, "Let's fly."
So I popped up behind the lead tank... and, uh, started to go up the hill.
And everything was cool, until we started taking fire.
And, uh, the A.R.V.N. started to split.
And that's when I got it.
I said, "Oh, my God. I'm hit."
I couldn't believe it, you know?
"I can't believe it.
I'm really hit."
And my first, first thought... was Kay, my girl, you know?
It's gonna sound stupid, but I'm... but my thought was "she'll kill me."
You know, here I was dying and I was worried that she was gonna kill me.
But then I realized that I didn't have to worry because I was dying.
It's all over. And for what, you know?
My last... My last conscious thought... was "I can't believe it. I'm dying.
On this shitty piece of ground, I'm dying... and I can't fuckin' believe it."
Bobby was a surfer, he was a wrestler, he was a long-distance runner.
We danced. He was active.
Active, active.
Our whole life was active.
And now they're telling me that he's paralyzed.
He couldn't believe it and I couldn't believe it. Right now...
Bobby's not a boyfriend. He's not a husband. He's not a brother.
It-It's very...
It's very hard.
What hurts the most... and this is a purely personal thing, you know?
Right, wrong or indifferent, that's how I feel.
When I was in the Marine Corps,
I remember I was in the Marine
Corps barracks in Washington...
They call it "A," "F," and "I."
And they had the Marine
Corps drill team there.
And I was standing at attention in my uniform... and they were playing the
"Marine Corps Hymn".
And then they played the
'star-Spangled Banner."
And I actually started to cry.
I cried because I was so proud to be an American, you know?
And I was so proud to be a marine... and in uniform, standing there at attention.
That-That represented so much to me... in the way of life and...
That's gone, you know?
And that hurt. That hurts.
That's what I'm bitter about.
Ha! Didn't think we were here, did you, you dirty rotten rats!
We're still here!
We'll always be here!
Truman lied from 1950 on... on the nature and purposes of the French involvement, the colonial reconquest of Vietnam... that we were financing and encouraging.
Eisenhower lied about the reasons for... and the nature of our involvement with Diem, and the fact that he was in power, essentially, because of American support,
American money, and for no other reason.
Kennedy lied about the type of involvement we were doing there, our own combat involvement, and about the recommendations that were made to him for greater involvement.
President Kennedy lied about... the degree of our participation in the overthrow of Diem.
The, um... Johnson, of course, lied and lied and lied... about our provocations against the North Vietnamese... prior to and after the Tonkin Gulf incidents, about the plans for bombing North Vietnam, and the nature of the buildup... of American troops in Vietnam.
Nixon, as we now know, misled and lied to the American public... for the first months of his office in terms of our bombing of Cambodia... and of Laos, ground operations in Laos, the reasons for our invasion of Cambodia and of Laos, and the prospects for the mining at
Haiphong that came about in 1972, but was envisioned as early as 1969.
The American public was lied to month by month... by each of these five administrations.
As I say, it's a tribute to the American public, that their leaders perceived that they had to be lied to.
It's no tribute to us that it was so easy to fool the public.
We have adopted a plan... which we have worked out in cooperation with the South Vietnamese... for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. combat ground forces... and their replacement by South Vietnamese forces... on an orderly, scheduled timetable.
This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness.
As South Vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of American withdrawal can become greater.
Congratulations to Battalion 332... on your recent victories over the communists.
We ask ourselves,
"When will peace come?"
And I tell you, if you chase the communists back to the north, there won't be any war in this hamlet.
Help rebuild the houses.
Help the people.
Rid the hamlet of all V. C... so there will be no more suffering and destruction... for ourselves and our compatriots.
Oh, my friend.
- How you doing? Good to see you again.
- You just get back?
- Yeah. How you doing, men?
- Very good to see you.
How you doing?
Trung, good seeing you.
- Good to see you, sir.
- How you doing? Fine.
Just came in this afternoon, sir.
Been very quiet?
- Except last time, when the, uh...
- When the rockets went off?
Yeah.
Very nice. I read about it in Stars And Stripes.
That's one of our success stories here, this battalion is.
We had a real, uh... a lot of trouble with it.
We just gave, uh, four bronze stars... and five Ar-Comms with V-device this week... to a battalion commander and three of his officers and five soldiers.
And we have six N-pac awards... pending for last Saturday night's action... where we killed six V.C.
And captured nine weapons.
Good grief.
He had been the recon company commander of the, uh, 263rd... and he'd done a real tremendous job just as recon company commander.
And then they moved him over here.
In a ten-day period or two-week period, he completely reversed it.
They had the battalion here under a very poor major.
They had it to the point where the company commanders... were throwing down their weapons and crying... or at least one of them did.
Ten days later they had a big contact with the V. C... and in 3 days killed 42, lost none of their own.
He does it with a fairly limited staff.
Although some of his people, like that young major there, Major Yuk... tremendous guy.
He just heard his name over there.
Hey.
It's no surprise that in a very poor country... you can find people who will wear foreign uniforms.
What has always surprised us, what we've never been willing to predict or understand, is that the Vietnamese communist leadership... can find enough people to live in the tunnels, fight for nothing wearing ragged shorts, year after year under the American bombs.
A war in which one side is entirely financed... and equipped and supported by foreigners... is not a civil war.
The only foreigners in that country... were the foreigners we financed in the first part of the war... and the foreigners we were in the second half of the war.
Basically, we didn't want to acknowledge... the scale of our involvement there.
We didn't want to realize that it was our war, because that would have been to say that every casualty on both sides... was a casualty caused by our policy.
The question used to be "Might it be possible we were on the wrong side... in the Vietnamese War?"
We weren't on the wrong side.
We are the wrong side.
You have exemplified, in your corner of the world, patriotism of the highest order.
You have brought to your great task of organizing your country... the greatest of courage, the greatest of statesmanship.
I had two possibilities.
Either I could submit to Washington's politics...
Every morning, "Yes, sir."
Or I would have to resign.
You can be sure that as a soldier
I only submit very rarely.
And, in fact, never.
I chose the second solution, that of resigning.
On the Vietnamese side, I would say the most encouraging factor... is the promise offered by General Khanh's government.
Through a security service in the president's office, we taped all communications with the outside.
All telephone communications.
And fortunately, among these taped telephone communications,
I still have the tape from which we can hear precisely...
General Taylor... stating precisely that he wants me,
General Khanh, to leave Vietnam.
Can you let us hear it?
Certainly. I hope it works.
- General Taylor.
- Uh, this is General Khanh speaking.
How are you? Glad to hear you.
Uh, uh, may I speak in French?
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen, as our joint communique indicates,
President Thieu and I have had very constructive talks... with regard to how we shall work together in the years ahead, working for the program of peace, which we now hope will all be the wave of the future, not only for the
Republic of Vietnam, but for all of the countries in Indochina.
What kind of freedom could you preserve here... when you put so many of our compatriots into prison... without any charge, without any reason why?
Just because you want us to have freedom?
What kind of freedom could you give us?
We know that we only have freedom if we fight for it.
But here we fight for what?
We fight for prisons?
People can be arrested at any moment by any organization.
And then tortured in inhuman ways in all the prisons.
And, above all, in police stations.
And then imprisoned for years and years without trial.
Their only crime is loving their country.
They had the courage to tell the truth.
They asked for the liberation of political prisoners.
They asked for an end to the war.
They asked for peace, for national reconciliation.
And all that is considered a crime by the government of Thieu.
I was arrested in 1968.
I was at home when the security police came.
They took me to headquarters for a few questions... and kept me.
You can't imagine how badly I was beaten.
Mostly on the head.
My eyes are bad now.
After I was arrested,
I was beaten so badly... even now
I sometimes have headaches... and nosebleeds and ear-bleeds.
In those days, all we were getting to eat was rotten fish, so we asked for some vegetables.
But when we complained, we were beaten and chained... and lime powder was thrown on us.
And they poured water on us, and we had nowhere to run.
Our cells were this big... and we could do nothing but stand where we were... and get the water and the lime all over us.
Some of us lost our teeth and our hair.
And when the lime got wet, it just boiled up, bubbling all over us.
Our hair fell out and our skin became covered with sores.
They said that if we were innocent, they would beat us until we were guilty, and that if we were guilty, they would beat us until we repent.
In a country where the people don't hold national sovereignty, in a country where the government has proven itself... to be the enemy of the people, the prisoners are the patriots.
And no matter how badly treated we are, still we are proud, because at least we are free, instead of enslaved as so many of the so-called government officials.
And so, you see, when a Vietnamese works for peace and for liberty, he is considered a communist.
It is an honor for the communists to have to work for peace and justice.
So it is the government which gives validity to being a communist, because they continue to say... that the people who work for justice and for peace are communists.
You see?
We were learning to be good soldiers... back when you're three, four, five, six years old.
That's when good ol' mom is telling you to obey the local camp regulations.
In this case, it's the house.
And you start to learn to respect authority.
And so, finally, lo and behold, at 20, 22 years old, you find yourself in service and maybe take that last and final step, where you become quite regimented... in a military form of discipline.
That stuff isn't worth the paper it's written on, if the basis isn't there.
You need that cornerstone that goes back to childhood, and who's teaching you, but good old moms, women like yourselves.
It's terrifying. When you're facing a torture session with a bunch of gooks, it's gonna be pretty darn miserable.
No doubt about it. You're scared.
You're really petrified.
But at the other side, you have a bunch of women back there... telling you, "You better do something," you know?
That's the wrath of God. You don't want
100 women climbing down your back,
So you figure the gooks aren't so bad.
So you press on.
In many respects, the destiny of our country, and more personally, the destiny of me, your men, your children... is in your hands.
If you are proud of the P.O. W. S and personally of me, then you should be proud of yourselves, because I was what you made me to be.
As for my own view, uh, I thought through as best I could... the meaning of Southeast Asia to the United States in the 1950s,
Looking backward and looking forward... in terms of what I know about the dynamics of societies and so on.
And on balance...
It is an on-balance judgment...
I came to the judgment that it's a vital interest to the United States.
I've never had any reason to change that judgment.
And, uh, therefore, I, uh,
I do believe that what we have done is generally right, although I would have preferred to have seen a different, more decisive military strategy.
Certainly, to me, the day you can say that a sacrifice such as that is not worthwhile... is the day that you've destroyed all your real values... of what is worthwhile and what isn't.
And there's no question in my mind... that he and everybody else that did what he did... there's no sacrifice that is in vain.
Absolutely none. Down the line, that's the price you pay for freedom... and that's the price that you pay for the kind of stature that we have... and it's the kind of risk you take... to preserve the ideals that we have.
He had just a tremendous sense of humor... and just an amazing, instinctive sense of what was important and what wasn't.
I remember when I was getting ready for our oldest daughter's wedding, and I was upset because something or other wasn't going well, and he called up from Pensacola and he said, "How are thing's going?"
And I said, "Fine, Bing, but such-and-such has happened."
He said, "Oh, Mom, don't sweat the small stuff."
You know, it just made all the difference.
I thought, "Gee. That really is small stuff, you know?"
And it was. Yeah.
And it made the whole thing much easier.
And, of course, I came up in a tradition where military service was...
In World War II, there was no question everybody was part of it.
There was not the kind of dissension and so forth... that there has been surrounding the Vietnam thing.
But I think that most of the people of this country... are too busy to get involved deeply... in, uh, uh, on, uh, the kind of things that the dissenters do.
In other words, I think that really the strength of our system, and I think it's a terrific system, is that you do rely on somebody like
President Nixon for leadership.
I think his team of people with him are outstanding... and, to me, the leadership that he has shown... and decisions that he has made, uh, really have...
They're the kind of decisions...
I would expect from the president of this country.
And the action he has taken is the action I'd expect... from the president of this country.
I think the whole executive, legislative and judicial system that we have is superb.
It has worked many, many... far better than any other system I'm aware of... and brought us to our state of power... and, uh, really, of international stature... that we have a responsibility to stay with and to uphold.
What did your son want to become?
I suspect he would have gone into the newspaper.
He actually had just got a job with the New York Times... when he went into the, uh, O.C.S.
And he'd worked for newspapers in the summer... while he was at college.
I suppose that it's like any pain.
You don't remember pain too well... afterwards.
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Mr. President, dear people.
I'm thrilled to be here with you guys.
This is what I like... a captive audience.
It is always the custom at a dinner at the White House... to have a toast to the honored guest.
The difficulty tonight is that there are so many honored guests... that we would be drinking all night and into the day.
Somebody just said,
"What's wrong with that?"
The most difficult decision that I have made since being president... was on December the
18th of last year.
There...
And there were many occasions... in the 10-day period after the decision was made... when I wondered whether this country really supported it.
After having met each one of our honored guests this evening... and after having talked to them,
I think that all of us... would like to join in a round of applause... for the brave men that took those B-52s in and did the job.
My eight-year-old daughter was killed.
And my three-year-old son.
A son, three years old, killed.
Nixon, murderer of civilians.
What have I done to Nixon so that he comes here to bomb my country?
My daughter died right here.
She was feeding the pigs.
She was so sweet.
She is dead. The pigs are alive.
My mother and my children took shelter here.
Here they died.
The planes came from over there.
No targets here.
Only rice fields and houses.
I'll give you my daughter's beautiful shirt.
Take it back to the United States.
Tell them what happened here.
My daughter is dead.
She will never wear the shirt again.
Throw the shirt in Nixon's face.
Tell them she was only a little schoolgirl.
Well, the Oriental... doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner.
Life is plentiful, life is cheap in the Orient.
And, uh, as the, uh, philosophy of the, uh, of the Orient, uh, uh, expresses it, uh, uh, life is, uh, is not important.
During the missions, after the missions, the result of what I was doing... the result of this-this game, this, uh, exercise of my technical expertise... never really dawned on me.
That reality of the screams or the people being blown away... or their homeland being destroyed, uh, just was not a part of what I thought about.
Uh, we, as Americans, have never experienced that.
We've never experienced any kind of devastation.
When I was there, I never saw a child that got burned by napalm.
I didn't drop napalm, but I dropped other things just as bad.
I dropped C.B.U. s, which can't destroy anything.
It's meant for people.
It's an antipersonnel weapon.
We used to drop canister upon canister of these things... with 200 tumbling little balls in there about this big around... with something like
600 pellets in each ball... that would blow out as soon as it hit the ground, uh, and shred people to pieces.
They couldn't be gotten out in many cases.
People would suffer. They would live, but they would suffer, you know?
Then often they would die afterwards.
This would cause people to have to take care of them, you know?
But I look at my children now... and, uh, I don't know what would happen if, uh... uh, what I would think about if someone napalmed them.
Do you think we've learned anything from all this?
I think we're trying not to.
I think I'm trying not to sometimes.
I can't even cry easily.
From my, uh, my manhood image.
I think Americans have tried...
We've all tried very hard... to escape what we've learned in Vietnam, to not come to the logical conclusions of what's happened there.
You know, the military does the same thing.
They don't realize that, um, people fighting for their own freedom... uh, are not gonna be stopped... by just changing your tactics, adding a little bit more sophisticated technology over here, improving the tactics we used last time, not making quite the same mistakes.
Uh, you know, I think history operates a little different than that.
And I think that those kind of forces are not gonna be stopped.
I think Americans have worked extremely hard... not to see, uh, the criminality, uh, that their officials and their policy makers, uh, have exhibited.
Number one! Number one!
It's your country, not a toilet, you bastards!
They oughta go to Cuba. That's where they belong. Or Russia.
Boo!
You motherfuckers!
Man, let me talk to somebody.
I was in Vietnam.
I was a platoon leader over there.
What is this?
What the hell is this?
We were the ones that got shot.
You guys were over there too with your damn cameras.
Holy... Make my day!
Come on, smile a little bit!
Come on! Smile! Smile!
Be happy! Smile!
Everything isn't bad!
ELVIS: My daddy had seen a lot of people who played guitar and stuff...
...who didn't work.
So he said,
"You should make up your mind...
...about either being an electrician or playing guitar."
He said, "I never saw a guitar player that was worth a damn."

Now, this is a favorite city of mine...

[CROWD LAUGHING]
And we have been in 15 cities in 15 nights.
Elvis has been in 15 different cities in 15 nights...
...and he's not running for president.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
But he would've won every primary,
I tell you that.
[CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING]

ELVIS: I've never gotten over what they call stage fright.
I go through it every show.
It's always so wild.
ELVIS:
I'm pretty concerned.
I'm pretty much thinking about the show.
I never get completely comfortable with it.
I don't let the people with me get comfortable with it...
...in that I remind them that it's a new crowd out there, it's a new audience.
And they haven't seen us before, so it's gotta be like the first time we go on.
If Hal comes up and I don't see him, tell him to come back again.
- Okay, fine, sure. Yeah, all right.
- Okay.
- You know about the stage and all that?
- Yeah.
Nothing I can do about that.
ELVIS:
I don't like to stay backstage too long.
I got to please the crowd.
I mean, I got to excite them, you know, make them happy.
And gear myself to doing that show.
And somebody could walk up to me and say:
"Hey, your head just exploded."
I wouldn't hear it.

[CROWD SCREAMS]
MAN: Boy, it was wild.
Wild in the early days, yeah.
I have seen his clothes completely torn off, his shoes gone...
...just scratched all over and bleeding.
Just wild fans, you know.
Really don't mean to hurt him, but just wanted a part of his clothes or something.
ELVIS: First time that I appeared on-stage, it scared me to death.
I really didn't know what the yelling was about.
I didn't realize that my body was moving.
It's a natural thing to me.
So the manager backstage,
I said, "What did I do? What did I do?"
And he said, "Well, whatever it is, go back and do it again." Ha, ha.
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[MAN SINGING "THE LIGHTHOUSE"]
ELVIS:
We did two shows a night for five weeks.
A lot of times we'd go upstairs and sing until daylight, gospel songs.
We grew up with it in the towns.

MAN 2:
Speak up for us, please.
Well, he goes on and goes up the elevator to his room.

He comes through this door...?
Why don't you just tell me?
He comes through this door, goes around...

Are you gonna be saying something to him?
Well, that just all depends.
MAN 1:
Are you looking forward to seeing him?
Sure.
MAN 1: Why don't you show us where he's coming in here?
He's coming through this door here.
There's two doors in this entrance.
He comes through this door here at this entrance...

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
All of us have something to say... but some are never heard.
Over seven years ago, the people of Watts stood together... and demanded to be heard.
On a Sunday this past August in the Los Angeles Coliseum... over 100,000 black people came together... to commemorate that moment in American history.
For over six hours, the audience heard, felt, sang... danced, and shouted the living word... in a soulful expression of the black experience.
This is a film of that experience... and what some of the people have to say.
That's what we did in 1965.
We all got crazy and went out... and started burning up our own neighborhood and shit.
That brought the man on their own land, man.
The thing about it was it did something constructive for the whole community.
That's the only beautiful thing that went off.
Thank you, whitey.
That's the only way we communicate with whitey, man.
You've never seen in a community as many markets.
They've opened up a Dr. Martin Luther King Hospital.
There's more black people in Watts... that were formerly on county and state aid that are employed right now.
Like your mama.
Your mama got a job for the first time in 10 years.
-Dumb-ass motherfucker.
-I'm talking about black people...
-like you, nigger.
-You know he's been drinking.
You lived on 103rd.
-He's not responsible.
-Shit. You know what?
Once half a whitey, nigger....
It wouldn't do no good to burn over in Inglewood.
Them motherfuckers ain't buying second-grade meat.
Shit ain't getting better.
They're still putting offices off into the area, man, shit.
-They're making money off it.
-But look, brother--
You'd be surprised... how much that building, that particular building... will satisfy so many niggers.
-Pacify them a little.
-Make them think... make them think it's progress.
Up until the point that we had a riot... everybody said, "Those niggers are all right, they're doing fine."
Then when we had a riot, then the white man said:
"Something's wrong, 'cause these suckers are burning down my store.
"Now I got to give these niggers something because...
-" I thought they was happy."
-But what did he give them?
They've changed some for the best... in an awful lot of cases for the worst... and some they have not changed at all.
There's no difference in Watts now than Watts '65.
California's a weird state because they have laws for pedestrians.
Like, you cross the street, they have laws for pedestrians... but they don't have laws for people at night... when cops accidentally shoot people.
They accidentally shoot more niggers out here than any place in the world.
Every time you pick up a paper,
"Nigger accidentally shot in the ass."
How do you accidentally shoot a nigger six times in the chest?
"Well, my gun fell and just went crazy."
It's going to be the best sound, though, that's ever been.
-I can dig it.
-So we're sure of that.
That's beautiful. I work in sound, also.
I'm hip to it.
This is the biggest and the best sound equipment around, in our opinion.
-How many people do you have there?
-Four, Mr. Van Peebles.
Okay, there'll be one more, which will be five.
Now, of those five people down at that end of the tunnel... there will be three and two... three on the gate and two in the dressing rooms.
When the gate slows down after the festival gets underway... we may then put three in the dressing room, and two.
Now, the rest of you gentlemen....
As the first Black Queen of Miss Watts at the Watts Festival... and the Watts Beauty Pageant... how do you feel about this concert today?
It's beautiful.
I think it's a very beautiful endeavor.
It's beautiful, that's what it is.
It's great, what can I tell you?
Fantastic.
It's a hell of a feeling.
I think it's beautiful.
Like, shit, a whole thing is going on, you know?
Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.
I don't have a damn thing to fight for,
and I got no country... and I don't have no flag.
I ain't got a damn thing to fight for, go up there, get half my ass blowed off... and come back home, and can't even draw unemployment...
-let alone find a motherfucking job.
-There's a lot of funky things... in this country, and there's good things, too... but you run into more funky than you do good.
Why can't we, as being the people, without revolution... you know, without political, social and economical change... be a part of America?
-I can say it in one word, brother.
-What's that?
-Politics.
-Thank you.
First time I discovered I was black... was at the Interstate Fair in Pensacola, Florida.
It was one of those things.
I was standing there...
I was working behind this little counter where you throw the balls... to knock over the milk bottles.
This one cat threw the ball... knocked down two of the milk bottles.
One of them was for certain, one almost fell... and he said that I kept it from falling over, and he spit on me.
Called me a black, nasty, lying nigger.
My brother... made me realize
I was a nigger, 'cause he's high yellow.
You dig? He's lighter than I am, right?
So we was playing with some people, you know, just running around... doing this, doing that, and then they called him over.
We was playing with some white kids.
They called him over... and they whispered something in his ear.
So we went home. We was going home... and my brother jumped up and told me I was a nigger.
I looked at this sucker 'cause, shit, I didn't know what a nigger was.
But these white boys, they identified with him because he was light-skinned.
So he went in and he told my mother that I was a black nigger... and that he was a white boy.
You dig? But, see, my mother's bad.
My mother checked that out, so she said:
"Okay, cool with it. I'm not your mother, because all my kids are niggers."
When I told my mother what happened... that this white girl had called me a nigger, and what does it mean?
So she said, "Wait till your father gets home, he'll explain it to you."
When my old man got home,
I told him about it... and he kind of gave me a weird look... and he said,
"Look, let me tell you something."
He said, "The next time somebody calls you a nigger...
"just kick their ass. Don't ask no questions, just kick their ass."
I think like niggers are the best of the people that were slaves.
You know what I mean?
And that's how they got to be niggers.
'Cause they stole the cream of the crop from Africa and brought them over here... and God, as they say, works in mysterious ways.
So he made everybody a nigger
'cause we was arguing over in Africa... about the Watusi, the Huwagada, the Zagumbo, and the Zamunga.
You know.... In different languages.
So he brought us all over here... the best, the kings, the queens, and the princesses and the princes... shit, and put us all together and called us one tribe: niggers.
This is a beautiful day.
It is a new day.
It is a day of black awareness.
It is a day of black people taking care
of black people's business.
Today we are together.
We are unified and on one accord.
'Cause when we are together,
we've got power...
and we can make decisions.
Today, on this program
you will hear gospel...
and rhythm and blues, and jazz.
All those are just labels.
We know that music is music.
All of our people got a soul.
Our experience determines the texture...
the taste, and the sound of our soul.
We say that we may be in the slum...
but the slum is not in us.
We may be in prison...
but the prison is not in us.
In Watts, we have shifted from.:
"Burn, baby, burn, " to "Learn, baby, learn. "
We have shifted from having a seizure...
about what the man got...
to seizing what we need.
We have shifted from bedbugs
and dog ticks...
to community control and politics.
That is why we gather today...
to celebrate our homecoming...
and our own sense of somebody-ness.
That is why I challenge you now
to stand together...
raise your fists together...
and engage in our national black litany.
Do it with courage and determination.
I am...
somebody!
I am...
somebody!
I may be poor...
but I am...
somebody!
I may be on welfare...
but I am...
somebody!
I may be unskilled...
but I am...
somebody!
I am...
black...
beautiful...
proud!
I must be respected!
I must be protected!
-What time is it?
-Nation time!
-When we stand together, what time is it?
-Nation time!
When we say no more, "Yessuh, boss, "
what time is it?
-Nation time!
-What time is it?
Sister Kim Weston,
the black national anthem.
Won't you sing it with me, everybody?
We've got some difficult days ahead...
but it really doesn't matter with me now.
Because I've been to the mountaintop...
and I don't mind.
Like anybody, I would like to live...
a long life. Longevity has its place...
but I'm not concerned about that now.
I just want to do God's will.
And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain...
and I've looked over...
and I've seen the promised land.
I may not get there with you...
but I want you to know tonight...
that we as a people
will get to the promised land.
So I'm happy tonight.
I'm not worried about anything.
I'm not fearing any man.
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord!
I remember, we used to go to a movie house.
It wasn't a church, you know?
It was a movie house.
And the thing.... It used to bug me, man,
'cause it was like... every place else you went to something like a church.
But in a black neighborhood, man, you had to go to a movie house.
But when you got in the movie house, man, it was bad.
I mean, the people got down.
I remember going in there, man... and I used to go to a Catholic church, and I went to a Methodist church...
I went to all them other churches, man, but then I went to this black church... in Oakland. And we went up....
I went up, and I saw tambourines and trombones... and drums, and I said, "This is church?"
I don't understand this, man.
And the people.... The preacher got up and started talking about God... and I was listening, and I said:
"l never heard anybody talk about God like this before."
This cat started talking about God and what God did.
And then he got this band going behind him, man... and the band started getting into it, man, and the cats was playing, and shit.
And I said, "Goddamn! "
And I started feeling good.
I'm reminded of the two thieves...
nailed beside him.
I believe one of the thieves said.:
"lf thou be the Christ...
"why don't you save thyself and us?"
And the other said.:
"Lord...
"remember me. " The Lord said.:
"This day...
"thou shall be with me...
"in paradise. "
I remember he and his 12...
on a ship sailing afar,
when all of a sudden...
the sky was filled with darkness...
the sea was raging...
the lightning flashed, the thunder roared!
The ship was rocking back and forth,
they were so afraid...
so afraid.
And I believe I heard a voice...
I believe I hear this voice now.
I believe I hear a voice crying out now...
I believe I hear this voice crying...
saying....
When I hear the choir sing like
Amazing Grace, I start thinking about... when my great-grandmother died.
She died of cancer.
I was young, but... the music, it just sets a thing.
You get a thing inside.
Every time I hear that song,
Amazing Grace...
I start thinking about that.
And when they really get to going, really get to jam...
I used to dig that, because I'd be right up there with them.
And my people right here would jump up and get happy.
I'd be wanting to jump up and get happy, too.
And then the building beats up, boy, and they get to jumping and shouting... shit, boy, they'd be getting down, boy, let me tell you.
And that comes from being black.
And now we're going to bring back
Stax's Golden 13.
Let everybody say yeah!
I love that gospel.
I know gospel better than I know...
God damn me, blues, because the white man wrote my Bible... and the thing that most black people try to live by.
You know, I used to go to church and shit, like I was saying... but black people know God personally.
Any wino you meet know God... right? Or Jesus, at least, right?
"Jesus Christ? Shit, man, he live over there, in the project!
"Shit, tell me. I know peoples.
"l study peoples.
"See, I used to be in the FBl.
"I'm the first colored person ever in the Bureau.
"J. Edgar Hoover appointed me personally, posthumous.
"That's right. He wanted somebody on the railroad to guard the Mexicans.
"See, 'cause nobody in the Bureau at that time could speak Mexican talk.
"See, I spoke to them. They'd be...."
I'd say, "What you say, motherfucker?
"They'd tell me."
Well, listen, we all know
what we're here for.
We really want you to have a great time.
We're here to commemorate
a revolution...
that started the movement...
and was one of the milestones
in black pride.
Some folks may find it a little strange
that we laugh...
we sing, and we joke...
but we're doing our thing
the black way to commemorate.
And now, one of the most popular groups
in the nation...
The Staple Singers!
I think that there's more awareness of....
There's more search for awareness with black people... as to where we are and what has happened to us... and what we're going to do with it.
I dig the natural.
I think the natural is a beautiful way of wearing your hair... for all black people.
When I get up in the morning, I'm natural.
And that's the way my hair is all day long.
Kids is what make me feel so good.
You see, you're looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life.
The younger youth is what's gonna make everything... to keep going after I done passed down the hill.
Young, gifted, and black.
I be a Democrat every now and then.
I be a Muslim, I be a Panther.
But I'm always being black.
I'm not prejudiced, because some of my best friends are colored... if you know what I'm talking about.
Black is beautiful because it feels so good. lf black is beautiful, white is divine.
Now, that nigger's crazy.
Don't call you black, you're a Negro.
You sound like them kids in school.
You ever know them dudes?
They get madder than a motherfucker.
"Say, black boy."
"Say, man. What you mean, black?
"Baby, I'm colored.
"l don't play that shit."
My parents was like that.
In my neighborhood, used to be some beautiful black man... would come through the neighborhood, dressed in African shit. Really nice shit.
And he'd be,
"Peace, love, black is beautiful.
"Remember the essence of life.
"We are people of the universe.
Life is beautiful."
My parents would go, "That nigger crazy."
I used to love to go to the meetings, when you get down.
I got ultra-black for a while.
Them brothers be rapping.
I never knew what they was saying.
But the brothers be having emotion.
"You see, the first thing you gotta know is about eating pork.
"Now, you eat a piece of pork...
"you don't realize the subtlefications of this individuality's prospect.
"What the man trying to lay on you through porkitis...
"you will not understand because the trichinosis of your mind...
"will not relinquish the thought of individuality.
"You know what I mean?"
Ladies and gentlemen, right about now...
the soulful, funky sounds of the Bar-Kays.
It's been said many times
and many places...
that freedom is a road
seldom traveled by the multitude.
We would like to invite each of you
to come and go with us.
And perhaps you'll see a side of life
that you've never seen before.
I'm the son of a badass!
Right now,
we'd like to give everybody a chance...
to get down.
Black people rip off one another.
I'll tell you which ones rip off one another.
It's the ones that don't know who the fuck they are.
As simple as that.
They don't know who they are.
Sometimes, it seemed the guys would rip me off so often...
I thought they were running the place instead of me.
It was just like them coming in and getting what belong to them. lf I can't work and make it,
I'll steal and take it. lf there was a way a nigger could put air in a bottle and sell it, he'd do it.
A nigger can sell anything.
I ain't gonna lie to you.
Anytime a brother would shoot another brother in his own neighborhood... then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket... they need to have the police down there.
The niggers are NAACP-ing.
Niggers ain't acting like colored people.
And we can't stand that.
But pimp, that's why.
Anybody that use somebody else to gain, he's pimping.
I'll tell you what, soul brother. Looky here.
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp-ass self, you understand?
Somewhere along from the day I was born and up until now, something went wrong.
And I'm trying to figure out in my mind,
"Do it take another riot?"
I mean, a riot that's gonna include a lot of killing and things... in order to get this thing going the way it should be going.
We're tired of gaming, man.
We're tired of all this bullshit.
We wants jobs and, we wants everything, just like they got.
It's not getting out and confronting, and fighting the man on the street... because right now he's got the power, and he's gonna win.
What we got to do, we got to get our minds together.
I'm not gonna get up on Front Street and front myself off.
You be fronting yourself off every time you be coming out of your house.
You see the brother pushing pushcarts.
You see the lady bagging out.
See the brother standing up.
You understand?
But you know what you got to deal with?
The waking up and going to bed.
Once you get a job, nigger, be respectful.
This is the Age of Aquarius.
"Shit! Man, get a job?
"What the fuck you talking?
"l went down.
Man, I ain't bullshitting, baby.
"l went down to the unemployment bureau.
"You dig?
"l just got out the joint.
You know what I mean?
"I'm in the joint,
I go to the unemployment bureau...
"the bitch telling me,
'What's your occupation?'
"l said, 'Pressing license plates.'
"Where you gonna find a job for a nigger out here pressing license plates?
"And I'm a license plate-pressing motherfucker.
"You dig?
"Old bitch has got a tiara and shit up there.
"Old, ugly white whore with old wrinkles and shit.
"Bitch got funky with me.
I said, 'Fuck the job, bitch.
"'Kiss my ass. And your mama, too.'"
You know what I learned up in Soledad in '67?
-That you got to...
-You got to what?
...stay out the penitentiary.
And this number's
being especially played and dedicated...
to all of the blues lovers.
And to all of those
that's not hip to the blues.:
We're gonna learn them to you,
teach them to you, brother...
'cause we'll be around for a while.
You know how much shit
I've been through.
I done had three mothers in my life.
That's why I think... you see a man walking down the street by himself alone at night, lonesome... walking down the street about 6:00 in the morning... he'll stand in front of the mirror and say:
"Ricky, what are you doing?"
And he'll say, "Doo doo da doo," and start singing the blues. You know what I mean?
I like the blues. I don't like the jazz.
I'm too old a man to like a lot of that.
The blues.
People have to have something they can relate to for right now.
I don't mean tomorrow, but right now.
You dig what I'm saying?
The blues is past tense.
That's the black man's cousin, the blues.
-I've been down so long...
-Tell them why.
...that getting up don't even cross my mind.
Yes, I've had the blues.
I've had men that I really liked, that I really loved.
And they have a change of heart, a change of mind.
And there you are, standing there with your heart in your hand.
Just like if you had an old car, and it kept stopping on you.
This is what I've experienced with the blues in many ways.
Not just being in love.
Although, that's one of the hurtingest blues you can have.
You know what I told her when she called me on the phone?
I said, "Honey, I done married again.
"l got me a good wife, and forget about you."
Yes, sir. "Forget about you."
'Cause that's all I wanted of her, is to let me alone.
But I loved her, boy.
You know what? I tell you what.
I'd work, I'd buy.... I'd wear jeans, boy.
She'd go to church with furs.
I ain't lying.
$200 and $500 bracelets, big ring on her finger.
Singing in the choir.
And I got two jobs to support that goddamn woman.
You know that?
And that's the honest God's truth.
You take care of business, far as I'm concerned.
Who? Do you know she was pretty?
Man, she had my nose open.
-So I see that.
-She had my nose open.
I tell you what. And right today... every time I think about it, damn it, I get mad.
I used to cry over her.
I ain't lying. Sometime I'd be at the job... and I had to go and sit in the car for a few minutes.
They'd ask me,
"What's wrong with you, man?"
And I wouldn't tell them.
I didn't want nobody to know
I was weak, that weak, behind a woman.
I loved her, man. I ain't lying. I loved her.
Did she hurt you bad, man?
She tore me up.
She turned me against the whole female sex... as far as life is concerned for me.
Can't nobody give a sister the blues like her man.
That's the blues.
That's the sure-enough blues, really.
You ever had a woman that you loved, or a girlfriend or something... that you really felt like you couldn't make it without?
And along come one of them old hip dudes and slid her right out from under you? lf you didn't have the blues then... you're right, you don't know nothing about it.
A lot of people talk about Jody.
You know who Jody's supposed to be.
Jody is that fella... that when you leave home... at 6:00... he's in your house at 6:01 .
I want everybody to get in on this thing.
-You all feel it over there?
-Yeah.
You all feel it over here?
I'm gonna tell you all
a story about Jody, right.
Just wait a minute.
Honey, do you know Jody?
All the girls that know Jody,
let me see you wave your hand.
Johnnie Taylor.
You ever try to get in after hours?
We had a place called the Blue Note... with a blue window, and it had a note painted in the glass.
Right, you could look through.
You remember that? The Blue Note.
You'd be checking, looking through that peeled paint and shit.
They'd be getting down.
You'd try, "Curtis, you going in, brother?
Take me in with you, man."
"Guess....
"Fuck you, then. You don't have to take me no place, nigger.
"Come on, do something. You bad?
"I'm bullshitting, brother. I'm just playing.
But take me in with you.
"l got a little business. You know I'm gonna get it on. You know what I mean?"
The dude take you in with him.
You knock on the door like a speakeasy.
You have to knock all night.
Then the dude open it. "What you want?"
"Hank sent me."
"l don't know no goddamn Hank."
Then the nigger go off, right?
Nigger get mad.
"Say, motherfucker, what you mean you ain't gonna let me in this funky joint?
"Much money I done spent in here, nigger.
I knew your mom when she was whoring."
Right, then the dude let him in.
"Come on in, man.
I was going to let you in. Shit.
"You don't gotta talk to me like that.
"Shit, how old are you, boy?"
You have to lie. I say, "19."
"Nigger, you look 35."
Then you go in the back room.
White cats in Vegas. I was in Las Vegas.
They gamble different, very quiet like.
"$2,000 on the five.
"Oops, I missed. Gosh, gee whiz."
Niggers be talking about, "Hump, baby.
"Shit. Bet I do it over tom-tom.
"Save that nigger. Shit.
"Bar. Bet the bar. Off-time.
"I'm trying to make me some money.
"I'm hungry for hog meat. Slap, Jesus.
"Shit. Gotta be a Jesus
'cause too many black folks.
"Nigger, what, boy? I ain't got no money.
"Get up off me, motherfucker.
"Shit, I'm trying to get this six up off my ass.
"lf I six, we're going to have a new crap game. You can believe that. Shit!
"Borrow what, man?
I ain't got no money, nigger.
"I'm going to pay you.
"Goddamn. Nigger won't leave me alone.
Supposed to be my partner.
"Get me a beer or something, boy.
I'm trying to hustle."
You know, the nigger be,
"Seven! Motherfucker! Goddamn!
"Boy, you check that seven.
The man had his hand on the table.
"He hit the dice. Nigger ain't fade nobody.
"Shit. Fucked up my money. Jive turkey.
"Shit. Brother, what's happening?
"This nigger was down, fucking around.
"Let me have $2. Give me $2.
"Want to buy a radio?
"Dig, mama, it got 16 channels.
"Fuck you, too, nigger."
I love black women. I'm black.
All black women are my sisters, man.
The way the brother walks is beautiful.
The way he talks is beautiful.
The way he abuses me is beautiful.
The brother is beautiful.
The way he makes love to me is beautiful.
You know, that's my man.
She's behind me 100% .
She believes in everything I believe in.
And whatever I do... she go right along with me and do it at the same time... with no doubts in her mind... because she know that I'm positive, and that I'm out to get over... and that I'm going to try to get a piece of this country.
I have to be the lead horse.
I have to be in charge....
Not in charge, but I got to be on top of her all the time.
You think you're the boss between you and your old lady?
I know I'm the boss.
The reason why I know this is because--
Your old lady's so bad, she actually got you believing that shit.
No, the black woman has always been two steps ahead of her man. Always.
I'd say I prefer an older broad to a younger broad any day... because the understanding is here and not so much here.
A lot of people think with their mouth and not with their head. Like your mama.
But you're gonna get her physically first.
No, mentally, brother. Go for the head.
The first thing that's gonna attract you is the physical thing.
Ain't no sense in taking no head and leaving the rest. Take the whole thing.
When a woman steps out the door, if you decide you wanna jam her, jam her. lf she can accept it, it's beautiful.
Let me tell you the truth.
I think I've had more women... than both of you cats put together a thousand times.
We're not ready for all this bullshit we getting from the black man.
We not taking it anymore like we used to.
That mean I have sex with between eight, nine and ten... between the hour of 7:00 in the morning and the hour of 12:00.
Now that nigger's crazy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to present to you...
the lady that did such a wonderful job
as hostess on the television program...
this morning of the Watts Festival...
Miss Gee Whiz.
Come on, let's meet Miss Carla Thomas.
All right.
I remember the time I was a kid.
My dad would hide in the back of the house... when a bill collector come knocking on the door.
My mom would have to go to the door and face him.
She'd tell him a lie or curse him, whatever it took to get him away from the house.
My daddy would hide in the back.
He was afraid.
This went on years past that time.
Black women would always be the man, so to speak.
When it comes to confrontation with white people... the black male was always kind of afraid to face the man.
And the woman had to face him.
That is the problem that stems between the black man and the black woman... today, because she wants to control and rule and run him, and you can't do that.
He cannot survive and get free... under the same thing that his mama and his sister and his wife put on him... way back there, when she had to do it to keep him from getting lynched.
Usually a black man is kept in the background.
Now they're coming up forward and I love that.
You let me find me a good black man.
I'll be damned if I let him go anywhere.
I always said I'd never fight over a man, but you let me have a good black man... the bitch can't say shit to me.
She will get her ass kicked. I don't play it.
The one thing
I really don't like about black men is: all the black women that there is...
I don't understand why they would... prefer white women, or whatever... when there're lots of black women... who can do more... than a white woman.
A white girl that digs black brothers... that want a black brother....
I done had experience with a few of them.
And they do the nigger right.
In his soul, in his heart... in his spirit, in his being... he does not actually feel the white woman...
'cause the white woman ain't hip to mustard greens and cornbread.
You dig what I mean?
The white woman ain't hip to his little tricks.
A brother can play tricks on a white woman... and she can't cope with it.
All she can do is say yes.
But there are certain tricks that he can't play on a sister. lf you get out there and pick up a stray broad off the street... don't think you gonna get a whole lot, because you ain't.
You're not. That's why I condemn all black men, black women... that get out there and get whitey,
'cause it ain't shit.
Some niggers I know like Chinese women.
Ladies and gentlemen...
let's meet and greet...
Mr. Rufus Thomas!
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah!
-I said, can I ask you something?
-Yeah!
Ain't I'm clean?
Fellas! Thank you.
-You all ready for it?
-Yeah!
-You all ready for it? Here it is!
-Yeah!
Hey, Mr. Rufus Thomas!
Come on, Rufus, tell them about it.
-Tell them about it!
-Can you hear me out there?
Yeah!
All right, I want everybody....
Don't want nobody on the field, not yet.
Now when I tell you to get on the field...
then you get on the field.
Then I just might get out
on the field with you.
All right. Here we go.
You all ready?
Okay, here we go.
You all ready?
-You all ready?
-Yeah!
Okay, here we go.
Now, wait a minute.
We all together out here.
We all gonna have some fun.
But you ain't supposed to have your fun
on the ground.
You're supposed to be in the stands.
More power to the folks
that's going to the stands.
And I wish the mike cord
were long enough...
I'd go in the stands with you.
More power to the folks
that's going to the stands.
Ain't no problem at all, fellas.
It ain't what you got, it's what you know
what to do with what you got.
So all of you, will you please....
All you people right in there...
please go to the stands.
Please. With a capital "P. "
Come on, you all, please go to the stands.
That's right. Might be a little slow,
but you just got to go.
So, how about it, brother?
Power to the people that go to the stands!
Power to the folks! Let's go to the stands.
Power to the people!
Let's go to the stands.
Please go to.... Don't jump the fence
because it don't make sense.
You and that upside-down umbrella.
I'm talking about you, fella.
He don't mean to be mean,
he just want to be seen.
Look, you ain't no Indian, lady,
but you going have to get off the field, too.
Now whatever you do now, please.
Now, will you please hold what you got?
Yeah, that's a brother, all right.
Yeah, that's a brother, all right,
but I'll be damned if he's my brother.
Somebody told him he's cute
and he want to try to show it off out there.
Standing there, looking just like the thing
that eat up my grandpa 's dog.
See, the good part about it...
the very good part about all that,
now he knows he's wrong.
But if you go out there
and try to tell him he's wrong...
then want to try to whoop
everybody, see?
See, he's got his fists up now.
See what I'm talking about?
And that's what you call our black brother.
Now you all get him off.
You all got out there and get him off.
Get him off, you all! Get him on off.
Just take him right on off
and everything will be all right, y'all.
They'd arrest me, especially at night.
They have a curfew, right?
Niggers have to be home by 1 1 :00,
Negroes, 12:00.
And you'd be trying to get home.
Doing your cool running shit.
Always they'd catch you out in front of a store or something...
'cause you be taking shortcuts, right?
Cops: "Put your hands up, black boy! "
You panic. "All right, don't move! "
You be scared to death.
"Put your hands against the wall! "
"There ain't no wall." "Find one.
"Put the handcuffs on him, Fred."
They put the handcuffs on, and I was really skinny.
They'd slip off and the dude would get mad.
"All right. Put them on his ankles or his ass or something."
They handcuffed my thighs, right?
Hopped me to the car.
Then they call my father about 4:00 in the morning.
"Mr. Pryor, we have your son down here at headquarters.
"What about it?" "Fuck him."
You know.
And my mother'd have to beg him to come get me out.
"Please, Bucky, go get him."
"Fuck that nigger."
"l told him to be home at 1 1 :00, and I meant 1 1 :00!
"Goddamn, every time I turn around, that nigger's in jail.
"I'm tired of getting him out."
I'd be praying he'd have a heart attack before he'd get there...
'cause he'd put some shit on you.
"I'm gonna get your ass out.
'Cause you know I'm gonna tear your....
"How much is it, man?
$12? Yeah, I'll pay it.
"And you know I'll get your ass.
Yeah, you can believe that shit."
And my mother be crying:
"It hurts me more than it hurts you."
I'd say, "Yeah, let him beat your ass."
Here he comes.
This is the man
that put romance in your hearts.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Luther Ingram!
I can't believe you don't mess around, man.
Yeah. Everybody mess around.
Even married men mess around.
What's to keep your old lady from messing around?
Some of your best relationships are with married women... because they aren't able to take a lot of your time.
I fall in love seven days a week and love everybody.
What's your old lady's name, man?
That ain't none of your business what's her name.
What do you mean, "What's her name?"
No, man, you say your old lady's beautiful,
I just want to know who she is.
You might know her already. That's why
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I left my wife all thinking she was happy and everything.
And look here, there wasn't no boyfriend involved in this here.
And I come back home.
It was cold. January 27.
-That when she put you out?
-She didn't put me out.
-What happened?
She hired her a van line and moved.
I don't mess around with any of my partners' old ladies... who are married, you know?
When I go by there, it's a thing that I respect, man.
But I figure there's enough women out there... for a brother who's supposed to be your partner, you can go out there and catch.
Don't mess with someone's old lady.
All of them, I respect them and their old lady.
The old lady, if she forced me into a thing, really forced me... man, I wouldn't punk out. I'd rip her, but--
I know one thing. lf I was going out with one...
I'd always try to stay out the other fella's way.
Have you ever, in your life... had to jump out of a window behind a woman?
Have you been caught in a bed with a woman?
Yes, I have.
-ls that where you got this from?
-Hey, look here....
The lineup. See, the lineup, man, is a thing that....
I used to be in Peoria, it's a small town.
I'd be in the lineup for entertainment on Saturday nights...
'cause there wasn't nothing to do.
Know what I mean?
'Cause ugly white women used to say they got raped by niggers.
"A nigger raped me."
And nigger guys be going:
"Are you sure?"
They'd go round up some niggers.
You know, like:
"You were down last week.
Know what to do, don't you?
"Come on down again, will you?
We got to have a lineup."
It was a lot of fun unless you got picked.
Then it was your ass.
And then always at line up, you know, you'd stand up in them lights.
It'd be like acting to me. I loved it.
But some dudes didn't understand that shit. Just be:
The lights be, you know....
"All right, bring them out.
"All right, what's your name?"
"What's happening?
"l mean what am I charged with?
You know what I mean, man?
"l ain't did nothing, man.
I thought that was my mother's car.
"l went out to the bank.
"No, man, my mother told me....
I was downtown, you see?
"My mama said, 'Pick the car up in front of the bank at 2:15.'
"So, I got in the car,
I was driving down the street.
"l didn't know what was happening.
"This white lady was sitting next to me, screaming and shit.
"l thought it was a stickup."
There are specific instructions...
when lsaac Hayes comes on.
lf the barrier is broken...
lsaac will be immediately
taken from the stage...
and will not be allowed to return.
You must keep your seats.
Do we want to see lsaac Hayes?
-Yeah!
-Brothers and sisters...
we are now about to bring forth...
a bad...
bad.... I'm a preacher, I can't say it.
We're getting ready to bring right now...
the brother all of us have been waiting for!
The one we've been waiting for!
A bad, bad...
brother!
lsaac Hayes!
Thank you. Right on. Thank you.
Yeah.
Saturday night though was....
They always called it "nigger night" ...
'cause white folks go out about 8:00 and leave and go home at 10:00.
And leave it to the niggers,
'cause it gets thick.
They can't handle it.
I mean, too many niggers.
When they found out niggers could talk other than "do wah ho" ... they got scared to death.
Like one day somebody said:
"Nigger, talk."
-" I've been wanting to tell you something."
-" I beg your pardon?"
Now niggers got a handshake. lf you don't learn the handshake, see, niggers change their shit all the time.
Like, you be meeting a nigger, he'd go, "Hey, bro."
But then, niggers add.
Six months later, the shit changed.
You know, they'd be....
Be all down here, "Hey...." lf you don't do that, you ain't no nigger.
Dude be, "You ain't black, motherfucker.
You didn't even know how to do...."
I can go anywhere in the United States of America...
and see another black man
and give him a power shake.
And there's unity there.
There's a beauty that
I can communicate with this brother.
You can take black people
of many different shades...
that have obviously come
from different parts of Africa...
during the course
of this country's existence.
But they're still a brother.
But we grow up together, you know?
We are one.
I thank you for your tolerance
and your patience and your cooperation...
because we know this whole occasion
is for a worthy cause.
The good master helps them
that help themselves.
Right on.
I am...
somebody!
I may be on welfare...
but I am...
somebody!
I may be unskilled...
but I am...
somebody!
I am...
black...
beautiful...
proud!
I must be respected!
I must be protected!
-What time is it?
-Nation time!
-When we stand together, what time is it?
-Nation time!
When we say no more, "Yessuh, boss, "
what time is it?
Nation time!
-What time is it?
-Nation time!

NICHIEI-SHINSHA
Hello?
Am I speaking with Mrs. Emiko Takada?
I am Imamura,
I wrote her a letter.
We want her for our next program.
She's not in?
When will she be back?
I understand.
Yes.
About compensation…?
Yes…Where does her mother live?
CONTRACT FOR THE INTERVIEW
If my daughter had only one child,
I'd take it to school and then be free.
But she has three daughters!
She says to arrange things as I want, but in this case I can't decide for her.
But I'll try to meet you.
My daughter has no time to lose.
But we need a lot of time.
Naturally if we can't finish we shan't claim any compensation.
We won't run off with the advance, we'd never do such a thing.
I know, I'm dressed badly, but we don't lack money.
We're rich, my son's a businessman.
I want a clear agreement.
We want it too.
Regarding payment,
I'm a bit perplexed.
If you intend to pay us, why not write it in the contract?
That's what I think.
But it's little money, true?
YOSHIKURA CITY SLAUGHTERHOUSE
HISTORY OF POSTWAR JAPAN
TOLD BY A BARMAN
In February 1958, 
I bought this place in Yokosuka.
ONBORO BAR
It was run by a guy from Yokohama, a gangster.
One day he hurt a soldier and no one came to his place anymore.
The bar was at the end of an alley, so I wasn't sure it'd go well.
But at the time I wasn't married,
I worked day and night and made lots of money.
When I acquired it, the place was called "Onoboro."
I continued to call it that because I'd no money.
- To change name you had to pay?
- Sure.
Drawing up new documents costs money.
But the place had stayed shut for two years.
I didn't imagine it would become mine.
Hiroshima is a pile of rubble.
Nothing blocks the view.
The atom bomb had devastating effects.
The immense heat produced killed and wounded many people.
Many survivors sickened with leukemia and died.
Emiko, where were you when the war ended?
I was home, because school was closed for summer vacation.
Were you home when the Emperor spoke?
I was at my neighbor's.
He was a shoemaker and his son a bank director.
We all went to his house to hear the speech.
What do you remember?
Radio networks then weren't so developed, the reception was very shaky.
But I understood clearly that the war was over.
In the video everyone's standing to listen to the Emperor.
We too, at the beginning, we came to attention.
Because they played the national anthem.
When we understood the war was over, we relaxed.
The police were watching and we couldn't show our joy.
But it was transparent on faces.
We felt really relieved.
- Did some cry?
- No, we all felt better.
We didn't show it outwardly, but underneath we were happy.
In Yoshikura did you see anyone despair like we see in the video?
No one cried for things so stupid.
American soldiers came to Yoshikura?
Yes. We heard the armistice speech.
We were relieved by the end of the war, but worried about the future..
We knew the Americans soldiers had come to Okinawa.
They advanced slowly northward toward the principal Japanese islands.
We wondered if they were dangerous for the girls.
We wondered a lot about that.
At the start of autumn,
I saw lots of American jeeps land.
They stayed several months.
They didn't create any problem.
The Americans were nice, real gentlemen.
My family ran a butcher shop that had a big garden.
The soldiers thought it was a bar and came in asking alcohol.
We were afraid and hid behind a sliding door.
There was a hole about a centimeter big which we spied on the
American soldiers through.
They didn't look evil.
They always carried chocolate, soap, or other things.
They seemed likable, so we were less worried about the others.
When the festival period came, the fear has already passed.
At that time the festival took place in Kotani.
One day, while we were camping back from Kotani.
I had a fortune teller predict my future.
It was something I liked.
The seer analyzed my first and last name and said I was destined for business.
He advised me to run a brothel, despite my young age.
- You were 15?
- Yes
He advised me to run a brothel and then, reading my hand, said I'd do something abroad.
At the end of summer, you went back to school?
No, I stopped going.
You left school?
Why?
Something unpleasant happened.
What?
At the school I went to arrived a new boy.
- He came from Yoshikura?
- Yes.
He told my classmates my family had a butcher shop and that we killed cows.
My best friend asked me if it was true.
I knew nothing about it, so when I got home 
I asked my mother.
A man can marry a woman of a social class higher than his, provided his parents consent.
We women, however, can't marry men from higher classes.
We cannot change the social class we're born into.
We have to work a lot to get a little respect.
Since I'd never be able to marry a middle-class man and didn't like to study,
I decided to work with my family and give up studying.
After summer vacation,
I went with her to the station.
But next morning I saw her shoes in the house's garden.
I became suspicious.
I went to the first floor and saw she was sleeping.
I got very angry.
I hit her with a baseball bat we had in the house.
You started working?
Yes, at the Agricultural Bank of Yoshikura
I worked there six months.
I liked a couple colleagues.
One of them paid court to me.
I liked him a lot.
But we scarcely knew each other, so I didn't trust him much.
Did they know about your origins?
They were from Yoshikura too, so surely they'd have known.
I knew they'd never marry me,
I thought they wanted to take advantage of me.
In that period was the passage from the old yen to the new yen.
I remember stamps were distributed to attach to banknotes.
June 27, at 9 in the morning, the ship Takasagomaru brought home 
2000 soldiers from the Soviet Union.
The soldiers, crowded on the bridge of the ship, reply enthusiastically to the salute of the people welcoming them.
In the big cities, the homeless die of hunger and cold.
Everywhere people struggle against poverty and hunger.
The cities are destroyed.
Trains leaving the disaster zones are attacked.
Students invent the taxi-bicycle to pay for their studies.
At school old books are exchanged.
The black market spreads everywhere.
Tokyo swarms with abusive peddlers, but at the Shunjuku market prices are transparent.
Wholesale, piece and refill prices are indicated.
At the time did one earn a lot with meat?
Profit was sure.
But there were various ways to make money.
- You mean the black market?
- Exactly.
Unreported heads were killed and then their meat sold.
It was very profitable.
- The authorities didn't brand cattle?
- They did.
But butchers had a false stamp similar to the original.
They used that to brand the beasts.
I think they did that.
My father was a butcher, just like his father.
- And your mother's father?
- I don't know...
Maybe he was a butcher too.
- And your mother's mother too?
- I think so.
Then your father came...
Originally he wasn't a butcher.
My father's sister married my mother's older brother and so my father came to work at the store.
At 14, my mother was going to high school.
My father fell in love with her, but since he wasn't studying he hadn't courage to declare himself.
He went back home and married another.
My mother wanted to be a nurse.
She started going to nursing school.
She knew a pharmacists there and got pregnant.
When my mother went home to give birth, she saw my father again.
Together they abandoned their own children and fled to Yoshikura.
- When did you start menstruating?
- At 15.
- When the Pacific War ended?
- Exactly.
In Yoshikura, did the first menstruation get celebrated?
Some did, but not my family.
- You helped in the store then?
- Yes.
We rented a store on
Kaizan Street.
We opened a second store, a sort of branch.
I was there from morning to night to run it.
That's how I knew a policeman named Shimura.
- A police station was nearby?
- Not exactly.
There was an office where interrogations were held.
Shimura went there often and so, seeing each other often, we became friends.
Then, I don't know why, we began living together without marrying.
The police watched the black market?
Yes.
- Your store was at risk?
- Yes. That's why I stayed with him.
Really?
I did so out of self interest.
Else what'd we have done?
It wasn't a good premise for our rapport, but he was a good policeman and my family was vulnerable.
I thought, "If I stay with him, he'll keep me informed on police movements.
"So, if I have to give my virginity to someone, might as well be him."
So you stayed with him to help your family?
I'd say so.
At that time my father was denounced because during a check on the store they found a huge quantity of skins.
I went to the police station and saw he'd been maltreated.
That really grieved me, so I thought being with a policeman would have its advantages.
- So, when there were inspections…
- We knew beforehand and took the excess skins to the country.
Meat was difficult to hide, but not the skins.
Thanks to him, we had no more problems.
And we profited from that.
- Je furnished you useful info.
- Indeed.
IMPRISONMENT OF 
POLITICAL DETAINEES
At the time the Communist 
Part was at its peak.
The political detainees were freed.
Were there Communist movements also in Yoshikura?
I think so, but my family didn't participate in them actively.
But my father's brother-in- law was a militant.
He spoke often of Schuichi Tokuda and Sanzo Nosaka.
SANZO NOSAKA, LEADER PF THE PEOPLE,
RETURNS TO HIS COUNTRY
But in Yoshikura no particular notice was taken.
JAPANESE COMMUNIST PARTY
LIBERATION OF WOMEN
The world is changed and also Japan is changing quickly.
GIVE US RICE
DOWN WITH THE SHIDEHARA
GOVERNMENT
LET'S LIBERATE WOMEN
The crowd, enraged, irrupts into the Prime Minister's residence.
The police fire in the air but the crowd has already gotten in.
DISORDERS AGAINST GOVERNMENT 
IN ALL THE TERRITORY
In the naval shops of Mitsui
3000 workers gathered.
In Sendai 600 workers call for dismissal of Yoshida government.
In Osaka 20,000 workers assemble.
In Tokyo, in front of the 
Imperial Palace,
500,000 people have come to manifest with protest signs.
Let's overturn the 
Yoshida government!
After prohibition of strikes imposed by General MacArthur, the Workers Committee met on 
January 31.
Secretary General Hase, after long debate, cancelled the strike planned for February 1.
At the Shiinamachi branch of the Eikoku Bank there were 12 victims.
On the 6th, near Hayase station, was discovered the body of Shimoyama,
President of the State Railway.
A freight train ran over him and tore him in a thousand pieces.
The scenario of the massacre is bloodcurdling.
The Mitaka case shocked the world.
August 17, the train coming from Aomori derailed and overturned.
The police started an investigation.
How was life with Shimura?
He left the police and came to work with me.
He was a good policeman, but the store didn't suit him, he didn't like that type of work.
So instead of working, he started taking walks.
He behaved badly, he beat me in front of people.
Soon I understood I couldn't count on him.
We fought over nothings.
If I said a guy was named X, he'd say he was named Y.
- Was he a bully?
- Not really.
But it was clear one couldn't trust him.
I got pregnant but decided to abort.
I got pregnant again, but aborted again.
My husband behaved badly and I wanted a divorce.
My parents and in-laws told me to have a son, thus my husband would calm down.
I brought Akemi into the world, but my husband didn't change.
SHIMURA
After school, you went straight into the police.
I knew nothing about business, but I was forced to work as a butcher.
No normal person would put up with that kind of work.
I thought I could do it.
I even worked without pay.
All the money ended up in my wife's pockets.
I was always asking her for money.
I was forced to live like that.
I think I made valid contributions to their activity.
My son-in-law worked little.
Saturday and Sunday he wanted to rest, he didn't want to touch cattle.
Six months after starting work with us he sickened with tuberculosis, and was a year recovering.
He didn't do anything particular for us.
How did they cure him?
With penicillin.
We bought 100 tablets at 8500 yen each.
How was business going?
My parents knew how to do.
They bought cattle wholesale and resold them.
They made a lot of money.
COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS
FORBIDDEN IN PUBLIC WORKS
June 6, the government accepts 
General MacArthur's request.
It removes from public office 
24 Communist Party representatives, including Tokuda, Nosaka, Higashi.
June 7, 17 journalists are also fired.
IN TOKYO AND OSAKA EXPULSION 
OF 10,000 PEOPLE REVOKED
October 13 the government revoked the removals of Communists from public office.
The government decided to revoke the law of expulsions from public offices that affected 10,000 people.
CONFLICT IN KOREA
The Allies bomb strategic targets in North Korea, including arsenals and communication routes.
It gets called "The Korean War."
I remember talking about it with my neighbors.
It was summer, my daughter 
Akemi had just been born.
People said that in case of conflict we'd have to leave the country, because the Koreans and Chinese would land in Japan.
I remember that well.
After the war, we got rich thanks to black market meats and hides.
We the Korean War we profited even more.
When was Akemi born?
February 2, 1950.
- I gave birth in the hospital.
- In Yoshikura?
Yes.  They did a caesarian.
At the time my husband had an extramarital relationship.
He was going to the Shinagaki baths and was usually treated by a geisha.
Now and then he came home to ask for money.
If I didn't give him some, he beat me.
I asked if I'd done him some wrong, but he didn't reply.
He told me
"If I'd known what you were like,
I'd never have married you."
He insulted me, treated me like a slut.
I wanted a separation, but he feared gossip.
He said let the baby grow, and then things would be worked out.
But he continued having extramarital relations.
Being a policeman, he didn't know the value of money.
When he saw a lot of money he completely lost control.
I spoke with my family and together we decided to take a place.
We opened a pachinko game salon to be run by my husband.
I think it was 1951, because Akemi was one year old.
So Shimura became the owner of the game salon.
Yes.
The place did well.
My husband took a percentage of the winnings.
The game salon drew lots of people, so it earned well.
But this enabled him to know other women.
In revenge, I thought I should find another man.
One day I told him, "I'll have an extramarital relation too."
He replied, "You're ugly, you won't find anybody!"
"Yes I will," I said.
I remember there was a student who worked in another game salon.
Named Fujita.
I said to my husband,
"I'll make love with Fujita."
He replied, "You won't succeed."
"Yes I will, even if I have to pay him," I said.
JAPAN BECOMES AN 
INDEPENDENT STATE
The delegation of six members came onto the platform.
Six years after the end of the war, the bases were laid for an independent Japan.
You didn't fear gossip?
Sure, but I hurt too much.
My husband brought his women home and had them sleep in a room next to mine.
So, ultimately, gossip didn't interest me.
I had fun and could no longer stop myself.
- How did you lure them?
- Using my charm!
- I acted so he'd understand.
- You made an appointment?
I wrote him an unsigned letter.
I wanted him to think a friend of mine had written.
At the Tsukasa trattoria they made great pizza.
I suggested to him we go eat there.
That's how our affair started.
He still thinks the letter was written by my friend.
The end justifies the means.
Had I told him what I wanted, he'd not even have looked at me.
- Where'd you go the first time?
- To the thermal hotel Tsumura.
At the time there were only two hotels.
We wanted to eat something good, but didn't know where to go.
But my principal objective was to be with him.
- You proposed staying in the hotel?
- Yes, I was sick of waiting!
I went with him without scruple.
FUJITA
What did you think of her husband?
He was a fine person.
He was polite and well groomed.
He had clear skin.
You went often to Tokyo!
Fujita lived near the University?
No, his mother let rooms.
They were showing "Gone with the 
Wind" then at the Shinkuju cinema.
We preferred to go to the movies rather than take part in the demonstrations.
Demonstrators and police collide.
BLOODY MAY FIRST
It was 1952.
Were you in love with Fujita?
Yes.  I liked being with him.
How can I say...
Having a clandestine affair excited me.
I didn't tell my husband 
I was going to Tokyo.
- Then there were no rapid trains!
- True, it took about a day.
- Tokyo is far from Yoshikura.
- Yes, I had to change trains.
I often made a mistake and went in the opposite direction.
I'd no sense of direction.
- Fujita received you willingly?
- I think so.
WASEDA UNIVERSITY HOUSE
- Were you comfortable?
- Depending what time I arrived.
In the morning Fujita's mother was there too.
Of course I couldn't explain.
- So you waited till evening?
- Yes.
Why not go to a hotel?
I was ashamed.
I thought only prostitutes went to hotels..
And I considered myself different from them.
OSAKA, TOKYO
FIRST ENROLLMENT OF RESERVES
OF THE NATIONAL POLICE
August 23, the winners of the competition entered the service.
In full uniform they began the exercises.
ARE NATIONAL POLICE RESERVES 
PART OF THE ARMED FORCES?
TOKYO
INSTITUTE OF DEFENSE FORCES
October 15, day of their institution the Defense Forces parade in Jingu Stadium.
Our armed troops defend the security of out country.
You made up with Shimura?
Reconciled with him, much time passed.
He stopped going with prostitutes, but...
I recall at this time my mother and father were also in crisis.
To make love, two have to want it.
The problems between me and my husband frazzled their rapport too.
It was my fault.
I went to them off, ate and got drunk.
Things were always getting worse without my noticing.
Maybe my mother sought another man just to profit from him.
I don't know if they finally were in love.
One day I got drunk and told my mother what I thought.
She replied that everyone can make mistakes.
I replied one can't go on making the same errors year after year.
She said I wasn't considering her reasons.
She repeated she'd made a mistake.
Did you witness their rapport?
Yes, they made love in the bath.
I saw them with my eyes.
For this reason you left Shimura?
I hadn't love him for some time.
I no longer cared about the gossips, so I decided to leave.
Masako was born in 1955.
The father was Shimura...
Yes.
- So you were making love with him again?  - Yes.
How as the game salon doing?
Some machines were forbidden.
Clients diminished.
Many salons closed.
We thought we'd try a different activity.
At the time there were no pubs, tea shops or beerhalls.
Our place was rather big, so we decided to transform it into a pub.
It was the first time I did this sort of thing.
I told my husband I'd take a management course in Osaka, instead I went to Tokyo to meet Fujita.
I went there often and left my daughter Mami with my mother.
One day Fujita's mother invited me to a picnic
We went to Inogashira Park where there was a little lake with a bridge.
While we crossed the bridge, with parasol in hand, she said:
"Emiko, let's sing together?"
I didn't immediately understand, but she sang a little song.
- "Life Is Shot"?
- Yes.
She said, "I'll sing first, then you repeat it."
She was a bit eccentric.
She was funny, and clicked her dentures.
- But she sang well.
- I think so.
She was likable.
One day I told Emiko that I wanted to marry my actual wife.
She kept quiet awhile.
Then went out and disappeared for about three hours.
When I decided to go look for her,
I saw her coming back.
She'd died her hair red and had gaudy nail polish.
At the time there was a girl I liked a lot, named Michiko Hamamura.
She had hair died red and my sister Micchan imitated her.
My brother, fearing gossip, told her to stop, and beat her.
One day Micchan came to me.
At the time I was working in the tea room.
She told me she wanted to go away because our brother was beating her.
I told her she needed patience.
But she was determined to leave and since I was unhappy too,
I decided to follow her.
In August we went to Yokohama.
We wanted to go to Tokyo, but then decided on Yokohama.
Why?
In our place we often heard foreigners talking about Yokohama.
My sister liked foreigners and hoped to find one in Yokohama.
According to her they were nicer than Japanese.
She knew my husband beat me.
We stayed a week in a hotel.
At the end we asked a cab driver to show us a place for fun.
In front of the EM Club was a place called Blue Moon.
The owner was an old army comrade of the cabby, so he took us there.
YOKOSUKA
Japanese women could not go in the EM Club.
AN EX EMPLOYEE OF THE 
EM CLUB SPEAKS
It was a place of prostitutes serving soldiers.
It was a sort of breakwater.
50 women worked there, it was a big operation.
Sunagawa became an extension of the American base in Tachikawa.
For 4 days,
the squadron of survey specialists
tried to enter the city.
After repeated encounters, the soldiers fell back.
The citizens tried to block them, burning wood
and leaving manure from the fields.
There were scuffles everywhere.
The survey troops were protected by a cordon of police.
The resistance of the citizens continued.
After six months of protests the situation is still tense.
Then what did you do?
We worked at the Blue Moon for six months.
Meanwhile we looked for a good place to buy.
But with the war over people said that in Yokosuko few soldiers would remain.
So opening a place at that time would have been crazy.
But I didn't want to go home, so I asked an acquaintance to find me a bar and he proposed "Onboro."
When I went to see it, it seemed few people came there.
It didn't make a good impression on me.
But I didn't want to work more under a boss, so I bought it.
- How much did you pay?
- Oh...
- You don't want tax inspectors!
- Don't worry.
If you say so!
I didn't pay little.
At the time I didn't understand a word of English.
The girls taught me who worked for me.
Where were your daughters?
When I finished work, I went out with the other girls.
We went to the other neighborhood night places.
That's how I met the barman of a place near mine.
In the place I worked, there weren't rooms for love making.
So we met in hotels.
When my family discovered this relationship, they sent me the children.
- Just because you had a relationship?
- Yes.
Why?
They were looking after my daughters so I could work at the place.
But when they knew about this man, they didn't want to do it anymore.
It didn't go exactly like that.
Akemi was very troubled,
I'd had problems educating her..
It was right that the children were followed by their mother.
How old were they then?
Akemi 9, and Mami 4.
My companion and I rented an apartment in Hinode-cho and went to live there.
FIRST FLOOR OF ONBORO BAR
Akemi and Mami live in the place along with other people..
We went back to the apartment just to sleep.
Meanwhile my father and mother were breaking up.
She had a lover.
But she was very smart in business, so my sister and I invited her to join us in Yokosuka and she accepted.
She intended to run a hotel and found an intermediary to find one for her.
He found one and took my mother to see it.
She fell in love with it right away, because it was solidly built.
After buying it, she learned it had formerly been a bordello.
My mother said it wouldn't work as a hotel and decided to put some girls in it.
- What was it called?
- Misuzu.
LAW AGAINST PROSTITUTION
PASSED
Many women work in the streets.
They lead a miserable life.
A regular client of Misuzu committed suicide because of piled up debts.
It was your fault and your sister's,
I knew nothing about that hotel.
I bought it without knowing what it was.
You always blame others for your mistakes!
Who went to see the hotel?
Who fell in love with it?
I only bought it because I liked the property.
You lived in Yokosuka and didn't know
Yasuura was a red-light district?
It's impossible you didn't know!
MR. MIZUTANI AND HER MOTHER
From the start, that woman wanted to open a bordello.
- We have some problems, mama.
- No, it was nothing like that.
When you know you're doing something illegal, you think of the consequences if you get caught.
If you commit a crime you have to pay for it.
I knew this business wouldn't last, but I'd put a lot of money in it.
So I tried to make a lot in short time.
Sooner or later we'd be caught, 
I didn't hide anything of that work.
The authorities looked the other way and I concentrated on the business.
While running the hotel I heard of others that were denounced.
They were all being denounced, so
I decided to hurry to make money.
The authorities didn't care if 
I made a little or a lot.
For us it was more complicated, we also had American clients.
It was a Japanese-American market, others had just Japanese clients.
The clientele was Japanese-American, there were small fry and bigwigs.
Someone cried when they bit him!
It was a casbah.  They told me not to worry about the police.
But I replied it was my business alone.
I even protested when we help from a councilor.
You made me ashamed!
Basically we offered a place to meet, even if it wasn't clean work.
PHOTO REPORTAGE
With religious songs in almost military rhythm and passionate sutra prayers they found many proselytes.
At the time the Saka Gakkai sect was in fashion.
They insisted on inviting me into their organization.
I thought if what they were saying were true, no one in the world would suffer.
In that period I met one of my lovers.
We rented a room together, but I was always afraid my husband would come.  He came to the city often with a lover.
I was still married to him then.
He asked me for money saying he'd use it for photos.
He asked me for 150,000 yen to pay for film and developing.
I was very scared of him.
One day I went to a pub with an American soldier thinking my husband wouldn't come there.
My heart beats just remembering that moment!
While I was dancing with the Ameri- can I saw my husband in fury.
It was a big place, lots of people.
My husband dragged me out by my hair, everyone watched incredulous.
I felt shame, anger, sorrow.
I thought he'd kill me as soon as the taxi stopped.
He made me go from Mount Hara to in front of Saikei.
My husband didn't let go of my hand one instant.
- You dragged her.
- Yes, it was the only way.
But it wasn't just this!
If he'd discovered I was with a bar tender, he'd have denounced me.
At that point they convinced me to join Soka Gakkai.
They said I just had to join and my desires would come true, all suffering and sadness would vanish.
I wanted to separate from my husband, so I thought I'd join Soka Gakkai.
I can say I profited from Soka Gakkai.
My desire came true, even if it seems strange to someone.
Shimura came to me with the divorce form already filled out and asked me to sign it.
Then I joined Soka Gakkai.
One day I went to the person in charge of the female section.
She told me I'd succeed in the divorce by praying a lot, but that afterward I'd meet another man like Shimura.
Finally I would no longer have to endure my husband's blows and smacks.
I felt relieved, after getting the divorce.
Often I went out for fun with the bar tender.
We went to Tokyo, to Gora… that is, to Hakone.
I'd lots of fun with him.
At the end he behaved the same as my ex husband.
- The bar tender?
- Yes, he asked for money and beat me.
My friends said I was in a comfortable situation.
Now I wonder if it was really so.
She didn't give me money regularly.
She gave me it to live, 
I wasn't worried about that.
For some I was in the best situation, living without working.
The bar tender understand 
English well.
He spied in back of the curtain, when clients were talking.
I felt obsessed.
Finally I couldn't even speak with clients anymore.
If I did, he beat me and dragged me around by my hair.
From then I believe in 
Soka Gakkai.
I believe with them my desires will be fulfilled.
Someone looking from outside can't understand.
IMPERIAL WEDDING
April 10, 1959, under a clear sky, the hereditary married 
Miss Michiko.
My sister was also named Michiko, like this girl, with the same ideograms.
Two Michikos, but with different fates.
While my sister worked in a pub this girl was joining the imperial family.
I talked with my sister about the enormous difference.
A commoner married a member of the 
Imperial family.
Instead if we'd stayed home, we'd have a normal marriage with common people.
We said, "So much money shouldn't be spent like that.
It's a waste."
- You threw a stone.
- Yes.
They say that boy wasn't admitted to the university.
I think he was angry too, as I am now.
He wasn't admitted and this ceremony was too sumptuous, even if it was a wedding.
He was angry, I think.
Still today I feel angry.
Among the spectators were middleclass men and Americans.
Such thing had never happened.
To those who asked me about them, 
I said for us they were a decoration.
- They questioned you?
- Yes.
They asked me if they divinities, 
I replied no.
They asked me why there was so much opulence and I replied they were decorations, we left the decorations and cleaned up.
Everyone listened incredulous.
They asked how they live and I replied with the taxes we pay.
So they asked me why we pay, if then the money gets wasted for such sumptuous ceremonies.
I replied I didn't know.
I too wondered why.
NEW IMPERIAL PALACE
It cost 13.5 billion yen.
An enormity!  They already had a house, it wasn't necessary.
They could have given the money to an orphanage or charity.
People mobilized from anger and resentment.
There was agitation and strong protests.
Yes, they could build a 
13.5 billion yen house but this expense weighed too much on people, so they protested.
BLOOD-SOAKED JAPANESE-AMERICAN 
SECURITY TREATY
Bloody clashes, wounded fall in mud.
More than 400 wounded on both sides.
Among the demonstrators also a female university student.
Michiko Kanda arrived dead at the hospital.
This death brought the anger of the demonstrators to such height,
that they burned the police truck.
We often discussed these events.
We said it wasn't possible to die for 1000 yen, more or less.
You think she died for this?
No she was only a student.
She was young, she'd fallen from inexperience, I thought.
But the Yokosuka demonstrators didn't seem to me like her, they also said: "Yankee, go home!"
The news said they demonstrated in Tokyo against the Japanese-American security treaty.
But in Yokosuka they said
"Yankee, go home."
People wanted to get rid of the 
American base in Yokosuka.
A few were against the treaty and many for sending away the "Yankee."
- Go away!
- Get out of Japan!
It's a terrible reception for Mr Haggerty.
Even a military helicopter sent to help had problems landing.
Mr Haggerty and General MacArthur
finally manager to get through the crowd.
Some 300,000 demonstrators from all over Japan
are arriving at the 
Parliament building.
Let's dissolve Parliament!
The demonstrators march in order toward the Parliament.
Liberal-Democrat Parliamentarians escorted President Kiyose.
The situation hasn't yet stabilized...
Your daughter Akemi was still little at the time.
She was 10 maybe.
Let me thin… Yes, she was 10.
She'd come from our hometown, begun school since half a year.
- She didn't go?
- Yes.
I was living with the bar tender, and my daughter wasn't happy.
I didn't like that man.
- Why?
- He was intrusive.
He bothered me.
I west to live with my mother after my parents' divorce.
I was very happy not to see my father anymore.
- But that man intruded.
- In what sense?
He'd order me to do this and that and I wasn't even his daughter.
He'd present me to others as his daughter which I didn't like.
When my daughters came to live with me my relations with the bar tender worsened.
At 10 my daughter started playing hooky from school.
She'd no friends, school was no fun for her.
She wasn't going every day but I didn't realize it because she'd go out every morning.
She wasn't going to school.
What did she do when she didn't go to school?
She'd go to our place or some other nearby to play.
I was worried for my mother, 
I feared she'd get beaten.
Why?
My father would come often to Yokosuka to ask my mother for money.
I didn't like seeing these scenes, I was worried
I wasn't going to school so I could watch over my mother.
I'd hide in the kitchen and watch.
If my mother told him she didn't have money, my father would beat her.
So she'd give him money.
Eventually the bar tender too behaved this way.
My mother didn't love me much because I looked like my father, but it wasn't my fault.
When I didn't go to school, mother would say to me,
"You're like your father in everything you do."
You weren't happy to hear her say this?
No, I was offended.
One day I asked her what I could do not to look like him.
She replied I couldn't do anything, it was a question of blood.
I decided to father my father with a knife.
- With a knife?
- Yes.
What happened?
The girls at the place saw me and stopped me.
One time a similar scene occurred, they made the knives disappear.
Akemi looked like my ex husband,
I didn't love her as much as Mami or Chieko.
She reminded me of my ex, made me mad, didn't even listen to me.
You still act this way, mama.
You make problems for me, my daughter!
Even if mama didn't notice, she said certain things to me because I looked like papa.
They looked as alike as two drops of water.
For this reason my daughter Emiko doesn't love my granddaughter, she doesn't cuddle her and she's jealous.
The other daughter, Mami, looks like her, so she likes her.
She's always trying to make her happy.
Now and then I feel unsatisfied.
I wonder if I was right to separate them from their father.
I wonder if they feel alone and abandoned because of me.
It's the terrible moment of the attack.
The terrorist was caught in front of Prime Minister Ikeda.
For serious events the meeting was interrupted!
The corpse returns to the apartment where the man lived 30 years.
The Prime Minister, after witnessing the assassination,
prays at the altar.
I like "Osho" among Japanese songs.
As soon as I hear it
I feel sad and cry a lot.
They have the record only in the place we go to drink.
I like the song because the protagonist came from country to city like me and worked so much without asking others for help.
I came to Tokyo,
have to win at any cost.
How the Tsutenkaku Tower shines,
my courage to fight shines too.
I told my sister: "Michiko, you don't have relations with Japanese men. you don't know their worth.  Try staying with a Japanese man."
She replied, "You say that because you love Japanese men, even if you say you'd had enough of them."
With passage of time the bartender stopped working and starter asking me for money.
He had no limits, he was always moving around.
Finally he became like Shimura, my ex-husband.
I was tired of this story.
I didn't like Japanese men anymore.
I no longer looked for 
Japanese men.
My little sister happily married a man from Kyoto in a traditional ceremony.
It was a classic wedding.
My sister didn't work and had a optimal husband.
I who worked hard hadn't managed to establish myself well.
Maybe I was envious.
I wondered why it had to happen exactly to me who worked hard.
It wasn't a good idea to go on looking for a Japanese man.
So I began to save money.
At the time among the clients of the place was Ken.
He'd been coming for 7 months.
At first sight
Ken seemed very nice.
He must have been an officer.
He was very elegant.
He was a client from some time, often danced with me.
He didn't seem a simple soldier.
I thought I'd put him to the test.
- How did he behave?
- He wasn't very able socially, maybe he didn't have time for it, he didn't use particular techniques.
I don't say we was trying particular techniques!
He'd give two bangs and finish quickly.
People had told me foreigners were very tenacious.
Maybe he was too excited.
The first time with me he came immediately to orgasm.
AMERICAN PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY ASSASSINATED
November 22, 1963...
Where were you that day?
With Ken, I was with him.
How did Ken react?
The President was very loved by the American soldiers.
They wondered what the future would be after the death of someone so important. They were shocked.
Ken said something but didn't feel directly involved.
- After Ken?
- After Ken I knew Jean.
He was a sailor.
He said when his ship came back to port he'd marry me.
He went off with his ship for two and a half months.
He had the right to an indemnity when he was in service, so I calculated how much money he'd have when he came back.
But the money was less than 
I'd expected.
I got angry and left Jean.
- After Jean?
- After Jean... Robert.
He was part of KDU, a group of 16 or 17 people who made small bombers for missiles launched from ships.
They were training planes.
You started with him around 1964?
- Yes, 1964.
What was Robert like?
He was thin, small, looked intelligent.
He was intelligent.
He was always studying, with books.
My place was quite thriving then.
So I didn't go there often,
I had fun going bowling.
I got pregnant.
- Chieko is Robert's daughter?
- Yes.
He went back to America after Chieko's birth?
Afterward… She was born in 
January, he left in June.
He was with his daughter five months.
- You knew he'd go home?
- Yes, we'd talked about it.
- Chieko wouldn't have a father.
- I knew that.
NUCLEAR AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
DOCKS AT SASEBO.
It's the morning of January 19,
the Enterprise looks like a little mountain.
It's 341 meters long,
It's the world's largest nuclear aircraft carrier with 8 motors.
- After Robert?
- Joe.
- How long did Joe last?
- I stayed with Joe 3 years.
It was a longer relationship than the others.
Yes, because my daughter was very affectionate with him.
Joe had divorced after the birth of a daughter, he'd been married.
- To a Japanese?
- No, a foreigner.
His daughter was Chieko's age, that's why he pampered her.
He watched her when I worked, took her for trips in the car.
Chieko thought he was her father.
She still thinks so.
- After Joe?
- After Joe was Mojo.
His name was Mojo?
Mojo said his mother was Indian.
Mojo crewed on a submarine, he only came twice a year.
He was a strange boy.
He wasn't refined and drank a lot.
I cried a lot.
I cried because he didn't care for me and went always with another woman.
- The soldiers didn't talk about it?
- No, they were intelligent.
- You made love with others?
- Yes, for work.
You didn't do it just for money?
If rapport was natural, 
I didn't ask for money.
Mojo west back to his country 
November 17, 1967.
What did you do then?
A ship had just arrived called Puebro.
Chuck came often.
Often, after relations with Chuck,
I asked him what ship he was on, but he didn't answer.
He'd bring along so many friends, there were lots of men on the ship.
I saw 80 people with rather high ranks.
I said to Chuck, "I saw high-ranking men in your ship.
Maybe they're spies." He didn't reply, tried to change subject.
Then, I think January 5, the ship left.
- It was 1968?
- Yes. After came the news they'd stopped an American ship in the Sea of Japan.
They talked about it a lot on radio and television.
I thought immediately of Chuck's ship, it was his ship.
- They arrested him?
- Yes.
That's him!
- First man on the right?
- Yes, the fat one.
There he is!
He'd the third standing.
The one looking away.
It was really him.
- He was a stout man.
- Yes, really!
WAR IN VIETNAM INTENSIFIES
Soldiers of the Vietnam government and the Americans
have attacked the Vietcong.
The combatants have advanced as far as the president's residence.
Marine came in support, firing has been intense.
Was there a hospital at the American base?
Yes.
- Were you there?
- Yes, to see a friend recovering.
Soldiers coming from Vietnam are sent there.
There were no wounded solders.
It was a psychiatric hospital.
I saw a soldier open a drawer, lift up a mattress.
When my friend asked him what he was doing, he replied,
"I'm looking for my ears."
He looked everywhere, rummaged through books, in drawers, took off the linen, the blankets.
My friend told him they were in their place, but he didn't listen.
- Where was the hospital?
- It was... over there.
Recently there was a massacre in Sonmi.
- Did you hear talk of it?
- No, I didn't.
There're photos of the massacre in the magazine "Asahi Graph."
I can't believe a thing like that.
There are the photos.
I can't believe a thing like that, if I don't see it with my own eyes.
I can't trust games of chance, if I can't put my hand on the bet.
I only believe what I see with my eyes.
You don't believe photos?
Those who write for magazines live on what they write.
So I guess what they write is more or less exaggerated.
I can't believe them.
The Americans are too upright to commit these atrocities.
I had Japanese clients too, but the Americans are nicer than the Japanese.
I can't believe Americans did a massacre.
War drives humans insane.
In a fight someone wins and someone loses.
In a fight someone kills and someone is killed.
It's wrong to start a war.
War makes victims of civilians, also of children.
They took photos after gathering children killed, they got the bodies deliberately.
I can't believe these photos.
That's the hospital.
Chieko is Robert's daughter.
It was a difficult decision to bear a half-cast child.
I don't think so, it wasn't a difficult decision.
When I was in my 3rd or 4th month of pregnancy, my parents came from home.
Mama realized immediately, not papa.
After a month even papa realized it and told my mother I should abort.
Mama told me papa was furious and I should abort.
I trusted mama more,
I could speak more easily with her and I refused.
She asked me to talk to papa and he said,
"You'll be disinherited if you give birth to a baby with blue eyes.
You won't be able to come home even if I'm sick or dying."
I couldn't talk frankly with papa, so I said to mama,
"I've sacrificed for the house, maybe I've done nothing for you, but I've always obeyed you.
Sometimes I do what I want.
No one can stop me."
It was an absurd situation, everyone was against it.
I was stubborn despite everyone,
I said I wouldn't do it.
It was normal for our parents to be against giving birth to a half-cast baby.
If she'd been married like his sister, she'd have had everyone's blessing.
They'd have celebrated the birth of a half-cast baby.
Instead in her case the parents wouldn't accept the baby.
Were you pregnant by Ken or Jean?
No, neither.
It was after Jean,
I was pregnant by Robert.
I was 36 then.
I wasn't young anymore, it would be the last pregnancy.
Till then I'd made only sacrifices.
I wanted to what I wanted, so I decider to have the baby.
Did you want to have the baby because it was an American's?
No, nothing to do with that.
I didn't care if it was a 
Japanese's or an American's.
After the abortion of the bar tender's baby
I'd not gotten pregnant, I was resigned to not having more children.
I was filled with joy at being a woman and seeing my stomach grow.
So I went ahead with the pregnancy.
- You like children?
- Yes, I do.
They're my reason for existing.
My daughter is black.
Not to boast, but she's very intelligent.
She speaks Japanese well.
She's wimpy, Alica.  Why do you want to give her good education?
Education?
She's going to elementary school.
Yes, but at the 
American school.
I'd like her to go to university too.  If she succeeds there…
You want to have her study so that others respect her even if she's black?
I also have a 5-year old, but I don't interfere in her life.
Parents shouldn't influence their children.
I keep after her closely.
The vice of Japanese mamas is to make their study too much.
We want to make them study even if they don't like to.
If you don't watch them enthusiastically, they don't study.
They achieve results thanks only to tour efforts.
AVORIO TOWER DESTROYED 
AT TOKYO UNIVERSITY
It would be mere be the fruit of the parents' vanity.
At least Akemi and Mami will be find place with good families.
They've finished high school, but their education isn't considered that great.
Why do you say a thing like that, mama?
Whether Japanese or foreigner today it's difficult to finish middle school.
Study is the parents' responsibility.
In February 1967 my sister Michiko married Franky, an American soldier.
He wasn't a common solider, he was an officer.
Unlike me my sister deeply believed in Soka Gakkai.
She prayed with Soka Gakkai to be able to marry an important man like a lawyer, a doctor or a pilot.
She prayed a lot at the altar, she looked half asleep.
Others said she was doing prostitution, in fact she worked a lot, she'd bought a house, was running a shop and, finally, had found the husband she wanted.
I feel much esteem and envy for her.
But sister told me not to look for a common sailor but for an officer, even if he's old.
I tried to have an affair with an officer, but it was a strain.
He'd tell me not to laugh, to keep quiet.
I had to walk without making noise.
At the end I was too tired.
"Never again with an officer!"
I said.
My sister, even after settling in the United States, wrote me my daughters should choose an officer, if they wanted to marry an 
American soldier.
A common soldier earns little, as much as a Japanese construction worker.
What do you think of your sister Michiko's opinion?
For me it's unbearable.
My sister and her husband behave the same way.
With my companion I talk about everything, even erotic issues.
We understand each other, laugh about things and don't think we shouldn't say things because it might disturb others.
My brother-in-law Frank doesn't want her to say obscene things, or to walk swaying her hips, or to eat so much she gets fat.
He tells her to ride bicycle for an hour or do some other sport.
And my sister obeys him, she dose what he says.
Franky is Germany and Michiko Japanese, oriental.
Franky feels inferior to other Americans.
He doesn't watt a life full of sacrifices, he wants a quiet life.
When I tell my daughters to choose an officer they answer,
"Stop it!  We don't want to!"
Akemi is with a low-ranking sailor, who dose petty jobs.  He likes it.
I don't choose a man for his work.
I don't care if the work he does is more noble or less,
I choose him for his character, his personality.
They don't understand me.
- For you it's enough that he work.
- Yes.
My companion work a lot and brings home everything he earns.
I prefer a man who works diligently, that's enough for me, but my relatives don't agree.
They don't want me to have a man like that.
Is you father interested in what others think?
Yes. He is. 
Men are all the same.
- For you even he's like that?
- Yes. When I'm depressed...
- You man consoles you?
- Yes. I like that a lot.
NUCLEAR SUBMARINE SNUCK
AT PORT OF YOKOSUKA
The nuclear submarine Snuck has entered the port of Yokosuka.
Around the American base the atmosphere had become heavy.
There were hospitals like 
Joseph's full of wounded!
People who went just to see, not to demonstrate, got involved and wounded.
Many people participated.
I was afraid, I didn't go out of the house.
I saw ambulances pass by with the wounded.
We had to keep the shops closed, we said we wouldn't be able to live in Yokosuka anymore.
There were many demonstrations,
My daughter Akemi was almost always going to my mother's bar.
My mother phoned me often from there asking if my daughter was alive.
When Akemi wasn't with me, 
I waited for her anxiously.
Once she disappeared for some time.
I looked for her at my mother's, she said she'd sent her with a soldier to the military base to buy something.
Next day Mrs Barbara came with my daughter to my house.
She said Akemi had gone to her house because she was afraid to have contracted a disease through sexual relations.
I was very shocked by these words!
Compared to this, I didn't care in the least if my husband went to bed with another woman in my house!
I felt as thought I'd been hit hard on my head.
I couldn't believe it.
I went to my daughter's room, she was downcast.
I said, "You can't catch that kind of disease without having sexual relations.
What did you do?"
My daughter didn't reply and I said,
"Have you had relations with a man?"
She didn't reply, didn't deny, 
I was sure she'd had relations.
She still wouldn't answer, so 
I got mad and struck her.
I asked her, "When did it happen?"
She replied, "Yesterday."
My daughter had made a mistake.
She'd lost her virginity, and thought she'd caught a disease because she didn't feel well.
Then I cried a lot.
Crying, I told my daughter I'd gone to live with her father without marrying him.
I told her I'd wanted to see her get married in a wedding gown with a man from a good family, even if I were poor and alone.
I was crying without stop also because I was pregnant and felt nervous.
I asked my daughter Akemi what she intended to do.
She replied she'd like to work in a shop and earn a living.
I asked immediately where she'd go work, she was very young.
I thought it was better to keep her close to me.
She was 15 then, maybe just 14.
It was in October.
If my daughter had lost her virginity while she was with me,
I wouldn't have reason to complain.
I had sent her to my mother's, because she liked staying with grandmother.
It can happen even when parents keep a close eye on their children.
Things happen.
She was 14.
She wasn't going to school anymore, she felt grown-up.
Maybe it happened because 
I felt alone and that man seemed so nice.
I'd known him for a year, I went to the movies with him and his friends
They came of to the "Candy" club.
I'd become friendly with him.
My aunt Michiko's fiancé was his commanding officer.
That day I met him and so it went.
My mother would have liked to see me married with a man from a good family.
I think that's something difficult to achieve, difficult, let's say, in my condition.
Concerning tour current husband,
Hoery Kimmer.
- When did you meet him?
- I met him in 1962, he used to come often to my club, the "Omboro."
I let him sleep there two or three times, but without having relations with him.
He didn't pay court to me,
I found him different from other men.
In April 1964 I started having relations with him.
At the beginning I wasn't desperately in love with him.
Then all of a sudden his ship was to go to Vietnam.
He left thinking he'd come back to Yokosuka, instead he west back to the 
United States.
He wrote me a letter saying he'd saved up some money, would come get me, and to prepare my passport.
I didn't believe him because a soldier at home can say anything.
Hoery came back to Japan at the end of November.
He'd saved $1500.
- Where did you get married?
- In America, in Las Vegas.
Hoery thought I was 36 0r 37.
I was afraid because of my age and asked him if it were a problem.
He replied age didn't matter. Now too he tells me not to worry about it.
He's sweet!
I was telling him again the other day, in our family we're all contrary, he's a man with little foresight.
When my daughter is 50, he'll be just 30.
I don't think a foreigner can stay married with a woman older than he.
- His daughter will return to Japan?
- Yes, she will.
Weren't there other reasons for going to live in America?
I'm sick of dealing with my people, my relatives.
But even if I'd like to,
I can't cut them off definitively.
But by going far away I don't have to hang out with them anymore.
That's why I decided to leave.
JAPANESE AIRLINES 
PLANE HIJACKED
To tell the truth, 
I wasn't obliged to marry him.
But that's how things went.
I knew another man, named Joe, who also asked me to marry him, but he didn't convince me.
- But for me it was the same.
- It was enough he was American?
Yes, I preferred an American.  I wanted American citizenship.
Citizenship could help me, so it wasn't necessary that it be specifically Hoery.
Yesterday I went to Tachikawa.
Now it's not what it used to be, nor does the Yokosuka base have a future.
I've earned enough.
With this money I can make more in international circles.
America is big.
Even with a little capital, I can achieve big results, but I'm human, I can make mistakes.
I could go back to Japan without money, but I don't want to.
They say it's easier to run a bar in America than in Japan.
It's not necessary to supply the girls, you just need two or three bar tenders, the girls will come on their own.
The license to sell whisky seems very expensive to me.
I could request the license from the authorities and then sell it.
I intend to study this possibility in America
Yokosuka is a city of sailors.
Many are looking for an apartment to rent.
If I had 30 apartments to rent for $150 each.
I'd make $4500 a month.
Will the madam of the Omboro look for another man in America?
Me?
My husband is young, maybe someday he'll want to leave me, I don't know when.
I don't know if I'll find another, maybe yes, if a good chance comes by.
Hoery is young and I think he'll find another woman.
What would you do?
In that case, I'd separate from him.
I wouldn't like to, but 
I'd divorce him, keeping what's due me.
Whatever happens, I shan't give up till I become an American citizen.
When everything's mine,
I'll outwit him.
- You'd go back to Japan?
- I think not.
I think I'd do business with old Americans.
I don't want to go back without having succeeded.
Don't you ever get tired of looking for men?
No, I tell everyone,
I want to have relations till I'm dead, until I have enough money to buy young men too/
Until I'm dead, I shan't stop loving someone.
I don't want to have less success than my mother.
I'm happy the club is mine now, but I want clients who are mine alone.
I want to see how well I can do.
I want to surpass my mother.
I wonder if I won't end up hating my mother by wanting to surpass her.
I'd like a quiet moment to look inside myself and to look after the people around me.

LAND OF SILENCE AND DARKNESS
FROM THE LIFE OF THE DEAF-BLIND
FINI STRAUBINGER
When I was a child, before I was like this...
I watched a ski-jumping competition.
And one thing keeps coming back... those men going through the air...
I looked at their faces.
I wish you could see that.
I always jump when I'm touched.
Years go by in waiting.
Could Miss Straubinger... tell us about the animals?
That was a great joy for us.
First we went to the quadrupeds.
There was a hind, full size...
- the animals all are full size... to give the blind an idea of them.
The hind's skin was wonderful.
There was a stag's head... with really big antlers.
Its mouth was open.
I was amazed by its size.
There also were hares... sitting, or in jumping position.
Some were afraid of the mice.
The second room contained birds.
A woodpecker on a tree... very interesting... and another, a green one.
I was delighted.
And a pheasant with its feathers.
What a pity you can't see the colors!
Can Miss Julie tell us about the animals?
They ask... if you could also... tell us about the animals.
I don't know much any more.
Her memory is very bad.
Tell us what you know.
I touched a lot of animals...
I had never seen before.
Pheasants, crocodiles... snakes, tigers, lions... and many others.
Also European animals:
Goats, stags, hares... foxes and even a mouse.
THE FIRST FLIGHT
MEMORIES
I was rather temperamental when I was young.
I made it quite difficult for my mother... she always had to check me.
My father died at the age of 33.
I was hardly six.
And when I wasn't watched...
I could do what I liked.
That's how, when I was nine...
I fell down the stairs... from the third to the second floor.
I fell on my back, and my neck... with such force that a neighbor... thought he had heard shooting.
He asked me if I was hurt.
I told him I wasn't, and I asked him... not to tell my mother.
I climbed the stairs on all fours... because I couldn't walk.
It really was a terrible blow.
I sat down and prayed:
Please, make that my mother won't punish me.
From that day,
I always felt pain... especially in my head.
The doctor said it was my growing up.
A second one agreed.
The third understood I'd fallen.
I always did my best at school.
I was very attentive.
One day the teacher told me:
Fini, you should write on the lines.
I said yes, of course.
Then I understood...
I couldn't see the lines any more.
I wanted to learn embroidering... but I had to leave that very soon.
They told me to go home... because I couldn't see enough.
I didn't care about embroidering any more.
That was the beginning of the end.
First I went blind.
I was 15 years and 9 months.
Then I had to stay in bed.
My eyes hurt very much.
At 18 I began to have ear troubles.
At first I didn't understand those sounds... and one day
I was completely deaf.
Mother talked to me and I didn't hear her.
She came to my bed and asked:
Why don't you answer me?
I said: Did you say something?
Yes, but you don't answer.
I said I hadn't heard anything.
We were very frightened.
My deafness was very strange.
First it was the right ear... and then the left one.
I wanted to see a doctor...
I took foot-baths, I prayed... but it wasn't any use.
Gradually I lost my hearing... up to a rest of 5%.
I fled to religion.
It gave me strength... but this terrible loneliness stayed on.
People promised to visit me... but they didn't come.
And when they came, they talked to my mother... and I stayed in my silent world.
And when I talked, my mother hit me lightly... and said she'd tell me later.
I wanted to participate.
How long did you stay in bed?
Nearly 30 years.
I always tried to get up.
Sometimes
I couldn't move at all.
It was awful.
When the doctor noticed it could be very long... he took me off the morphine.
It was difficult, but I got through it.
People think deafness means silence... but that's wrong.
It's a constant noise... going from a gentle humming... through some cracking sounds to a steady droning, which is worst.
You don't know what to do any more.
It's very hard on us.
Sometimes it makes us rather touchy.
It's the same for the blind.
It isn't total darkness.
You often see all kinds of colors.
Black, grey, white... blue, green, yellow... it depends...
Hello, Mr. Messmer.
I'm very glad... you came here.
Fini invited her friends for her birthday.
They're blind and deaf like her.
It isn't easy to Organize.
Everybody must have a companion... to translate everything in the hand.
Hello, Mrs. Meier.
Where is Mr. Forster?
Hello, Mr. Forster.
Translate everything we say... for Mrs. Meier.
She still sees a bit.
But they also need help... so they don't find themselves unprepared... in the land of silence and darkness.
Hello, dear Juliet.
Where is...
Mr. Hundhammer?
Noble friend George, where are you?
Here.
Hello, Mr. Hundhammer.
Thank you for coming with Juliet.
Hello.
Is everybody here?
Yes, all set.
Who's there?
Mrs. Augustin?
No, it's the "Little Snail".
Hello my "Little Snail".
So hello everybody.
Who will say a poem?
Please translate for the deaf-blind.
I will speak slowly.
For when the deaf-blind can't follow things... and keeps staring into the void... he is very depressed.
I will tell you a poem... reflecting on our situation.
The title is:
The most wonderful art.
To stay apart...
When others have fun...
But being happy all the time...
Gladly carrying out...
The most sacred task...
Renouncing in a noble way...
One's personal desires...
Living in darkness...
From the sun...
But shining like a star...
That is the art that only one...
Whose soul is bent on heaven can understand.
Can I start?
Ann with the beautiful hat...
Which becomes you so well...
You make up for joy...
You have cleaned our stairs...
For which I thank you here...
Today and every day...
For things well done...
Is what I like most of all.
In the afternoon,
Fini and her guests... go to see the botanical garden.
You can touch it lightly.
It's like a column.
Shaped like columns...
That's a cactus.
Very interesting.
This is the cactus' fruit.
The fruit of the cactus.
You can take one.
This is the fruit.
The autochthons eat it.
The flesh is good.
Who eats it?
The autochthons.
Are they ripe?
No, it's too small.
You must peel it.
You must peel it first.
Can I eat it?
Not like this.
Thank you.
Look!
That's bamboo.
- Is it bamboo?
- No.
I didn't think it like that.
It will be January... and I'll have a lot of work.
First the visits here... and then in the Palatinate.
No, not before Christmas.
All I still have to do...
Mr. Schwarzhaber asked me to prepare a show... but what, how and where?
For 4 years,
Fini Straubinger... visits the deaf-blind of Bavaria... on behalf of the League for the Blind.
Accompanied by
Mrs. Mittermeier... who translates everything into her hand... she keeps in touch with the deaf-blind... and takes care of their problems.
My coupon, thank you.
If I were a painter...
I'd represent our condition like this:
Blindness like a black river... flowing slowly like a melody... towards great falls.
On its banks, trees and flowers... and birds singing sweetly.
The other river, coming from the other side... is as clear as the purest crystal.
This one also flows slowly... but without any sound.
Deep down there is a lake... very dark and deep... where the two rivers meet.
Where they join, there are rocks... making the waters foam... afterwards to let them flow... silently and slowly... into that somber reservoir... which lies in a deadly calm... only troubled by an occasional ripple... representing the struggle of the deaf-blind.
I don't know if you can understand this.
The rocks who tear the waters... stand for the depression... the blind and the deaf feel... when they become deaf-blind.
I can't explain it any better... but that's how I feel it.
For more than 2 years,
Else Fährer... lives in a neurological clinic.
She is 48.
Her mother, the only person... who understood her, is dead.
Hello, my sister in destiny.
It's our sign.
She spent two years in a school for the blind... where she learned braille, but she forgot.
Also no one else wanted to take her... she's in this asylum, which isn't her place.
She withdrew into herself.
She never talks any more.
When she still had her mother... she could understand by touching the lips.
But that's all over now.
She keeps looking at you.
For you, Else, for you.
She still looks at you.
I am deaf and blind... like you... deaf and blind.
Not a word.
Maybe that...
Blind... deaf... yes...
We're just alike.
Poor dear, no contact with the world.
She says nothing.
She can't speak any more.
No possibility of contact.
I am Fini Straubinger, from Munich.
Does she talk?
No, but she looks at you.
When you let go of my hand... it is as if we were... a thousand miles apart.
Another much neglected group... unable to assert its rights... in our affluent society... where only production counts... is the group of the disabled.
Society owes them more... than just the right to live... it owes them complete integration... in various aspects.
In fact this is all about... our moral attitude... towards those people.
And frankly, this attitude... still isn't up to the mark.
A society which doesn't respect old people... as part of itself... is condemning itself.
I was very much impressed.
I was very upset when the President... came to me... and then took my hand in his.
His hand was cool, not cold.
And while I was telling of our needs...
I felt the pressure of his hand... as a sign of understanding.
This is what I told him:
Mr. President... think also of the deaf-blind... get us out of our isolation.
Help us to find those... who can break our loneliness.
Could you explain us... the tactile translation?
It's a system of dashes and dots.
But you must take great care... as to how to make them.
For instance, the short dots... are made with a downward move...
- H, G, D, B -
P is an upward move...
For A, E, I, O, U... you touch the top of the fingers.
4 fingers on the palm of the hand... make up a K...
One horizontal dash...
- is a Z.
- Everything goes like that...
...O...
Y... joy.
It's hard to understand.
Who makes you practice?
Practice?
Nobody.
My brother can't learn it.
You could talk to him.
He only speaks his dialect.
Fini visits Ursula and Joseph Riedmeier.
She is deaf and nearly blind.
She understands by following the lips.
You only speak your dialect.
You can't talk properly.
Her brother is blind, but has some hearing left.
You said you'd never learn... the blind alphabet.
He said: Straubinger.
I brought him a money-box.
- Look...
- Joseph, I brought you... a money-box.
To put in coins.
See how it works.
It's our natal home.
That's the vegetable garden.
That's the meadow.
Joseph often mowed it.
Poor man, what a work.
The wash...
Yes, of course...
I don't see anything.
I can't hear anything.
I'm just like you.
Ask if he understood.
Did you understand?
Sit straight!
You aren't that old.
It's the first time... these deaf-blind visit a zoo.
They haven't touched an animal for a long time.
It isn't hard to give them pleasure... but there aren't many people who will help.
Can we take it out?
You can do it.
You're nice.
Can I hold it?
What will its mother say?
DEAF-BLIND BY BIRTH
This is Harald,
Miss Straubinger.
One of my first pupils.
He came here 5 years ago.
He was a wild child... upsetting everything.
It was very hard to give him the habit... of a daily sequence... to teach him tasks.
It took a year... to give him some notions... of the tactile alphabet.
Helen Keller says... that this discovery... is the spiritual birth of the deaf-blind.
That really is the start... of education for those children.
Michael, sitting there beside you... still hears a bit.
We used the vibration method... discovered by the Americans.
He touches the lips of the one talking... and he repeats the word.
It's a car with a trailer.
It's very difficult... to guess at the thoughts of our pupils... how they think, what they feel.
We can only guess at it.
I still remember my visit... about two years ago.
Harald was a little devil.
He was fascinated by watches.
It's much harder still... to teach them abstract ideas.
We give them practical examples.
When we want to explain the meaning of "good"... we say: Harald gets up...
Harald learns,
Harald helps Sabine...
Harald is good.
Then we show him the opposite:
Harald hits Sabine...
Harald takes something away from Sabine...
Harald is bad.
That's how we teach them... good and bad.
Now let's go into the water.
Harald was afraid of water.
It took a year... to get him to go in.
Now I want him to get in by himself.
We use hearing aids for diction courses so they can feel the sound waves.
But even when they can speak a sentence... they can't be taught abstract ideas.
What they understand as "proud, happy" etc... will always be a mystery to us.
Vladimir Kokol is 22, deaf-blind by birth.
Only his father cared for him.
He never had any special training.
It was never tried to awaken him.
He never learned to walk.
He only takes soft food... which he presses between the tongue and the palate.
There he is.
Hello, Vladimir.
That's to indicate I'm here.
We can still get something out of him.
He will never learn to talk... but maybe to interpret signs.
I noticed that sometimes... he presses his nails into my hand.
But he does that because... he has no other way to communicate.
It's not to hurt me.
Don't hurt me, little one.
Look, he gives me the other hand.
That is a radio.
He likes it, he feels something living.
Is it music?
How do you get him to sleep?
How does he know night from day?
That's difficult for the deaf-blind.
They don't adapt to that sequence.
Does he know if it's day or night?
No, but when it's time to sleep... we take him to bed.
And he goes to sleep?
Can he dress by himself?
No, he can't.
Now he reacted.
I must talk.
He'll get to something.
Be a good boy.
I think he's bored.
Heinrich Fleischmann, 51... lives in a home for the aged, with his mother... since about 5 years.
He was deaf by birth and lost his sight at 35.
He was so much neglected by his family... that he forgot how to speak and write.
Rejected by human society... he looked for the company of animals.
He lived with the cows in a stable for a long time.
He's looking for my hand.
He's looking for his mother.
He knows my ring.
We want...
- to talk... a bit.
- Can he talk?
If he could see the lips... he would be able to talk.
When he could see
I talked to him.
5 years ago, in the winter...
I put his hand into the snow... and he said: Snow.
But I've lost contact.
Sometimes he says a word.
But it's very rare.
Did he ask who we were... since our last visit?
- No.
- He doesn't even know his brothers.
Not even his own brothers?
No, he doesn't know who they are.
He doesn't want to see strangers.
Yet he must have...
There is much I don't know...
Good-bye.
Did you say good-bye?
Yes, I said it.
If a worldwide war would break out now...
I wouldn't even notice it.

Where the Nile rises on the equator...
is the Africa of the great lakes.
Uganda is half the size of France.
Her ten million inhabitants have never known famine.
Her agricultural wealth, her exports of coffee,
cotton, copper and to developing industry...
allow her, for the most part, to be less and less dependent...
on the outside world.
It was shortly after the independence...
of this former British colony in 1962...
that Lieutenant Idi Amin Dada became interested in politics.
He rapidly became chief of staff...
and the right-hand man of President Obote,
whom he overthrew in 1971 by a coup ´etat.
Obote was unpopular,
and his fall was welcomed by the population.
He fled to Tanzania and a reward was offered for him,
dead or alive.
General Amin soon attracted attention on the international scene...
with his numerous telegrams to other heads of state.
He called Nixon
"my dear brother"...
and wished him a quick recovery from the Watergate affair.
He congratulated the Chilean junta when it took power.
He ordered the queen of England to send the Scottish guard...
to accompany him to the Commonwealth Conference.
Eighty-thousand Asians installed by the British in Uganda...
at the beginning of the century...
controlled 80% of the country's economy.
In 1972, after a dream,
General Amin declared the economic war,
which meant, on one hand,
giving 90 days to the Asians to leave the country,
taking with them the strict minimum,
and, on the other hand, distributing their business to Ugandans.
Today, the economic war has not yet been won.
Distribution chains and imports have been disrupted.
The country's foreign reserves are at their lowest.
In the capital, it is almost impossible...
to find sugar, flour, imported industrial products,
spare parts or matches.
Uganda holds the record for inflation in Africa.
In one year, prices have risen from 20 to 50%.
On February 10th, 1972,
to set an example and to combat budding guerilla warfare,
General Amin organized
12 public executions...
at the same time in the country's main towns.
Most observers agree...
that several thousand
Ugandans have disappeared...
since General Amin seized power.
Among the missing. '
The vice dean of the university,
the president of the high court, doctors and former ministers.
In 1973, the International
Commission ofjurists...
published a report denouncing
Uganda as a lawless country,
and it wrote about the missing personalities. '
"There is every reason to think that they have been assassinated...
by members of the army immediately after their arrest. "
The whole worlds are looking at General Amin... and at Uganda as a whole.
What will be the future of Uganda?
The people are looking at this.
I would like to speak as the heavyweight champion here in Uganda.
Um...
I am sure I will be in position even to defeat or defend myself.
But I wanted to tell you this:
As a boxer, also I am very happy to receive this as a rugby player... because I've been a member... of the rugby team in Uganda.
And I used to play second row.
You know, pushing is very hard and also wing three quarter.
You should know that
I used to run 9.8 second hundred yards.
This is...
With my speed, with my weight... of, of getting the ball... and when you tackle me, you can harm yourself.
I think you should know this.
But I wanted to tell the boxers... that the only chance to defeat the referee... who are against you... or against the country, is to win by knockout.
This is the only thing.
And this is the most important.
You must do everything possible...
to win by knockout.
You must knock anybody who is sparring with you in the boxing ring.
This is my last. Thank you very much.
Fire!
- All the man in.
- Excellent.
All in the heart.
Very good.
I come from very poor family.
I wanted to tell you this.
And when I became bigger, my father has no money.
I am to work, digging, and then people give me some money for food.
And some money I keep it and I pay my school fees.
And I study through hardship, not just comfort.
And also I used to...
Then I was taken by force into the army... here in Kampala during the war.
And... I went there.
I did not want.
But later on, because of force, during the second World War,
I was taken to Burma.
And I work there until now.
I went through difficulty.
I go to the rank, from my rank, from the rank of lance corporal... up to general now... I became general.
Your Excellence, guard all warmed up.
Formed up in two ranks, ready for inspection, Your Excellence.
And if they found that what you are saying, it is not truth, then they will never listen for you again.
And that, you will lose confidence to the people.
But the people likes me very much.
The reason why I am very popular because I always speak to them truth.
And if I don't have anything to tell them, I keep quiet.
We see the paratrooper school.
On March 10th, 1974,
the general announced,
"With the help of friendly countries,
"Uganda is going to arm to the teeth to reach...
an international combat level. "
As a paratrooper, they know exactly to jump and be into sections.
This song they do before they jump.
It warm them completely.
I can't tell you, because it is confidential in any country... cannot tell you the strength of the army.
Since I came in power, automatically Uganda become revolutionary... not only the armed forces, but the whole police, prisons, the whole public.
You see, lion...
Um, lion... if you don't disturb lion, it can't do any harm.
And also I like very much elephants... because it is a sign of liberty... freedom and it moves freely.
It wants a big space.
This is the elephant.
And this is a sign you can see in Africa.
There is plenty of land where it can move freely.
It can eat completely without being disturbed.
And you find this only in Africa.
And that is why you find that the wild animal... have got freedom mostly in Africa.
And, um...
And, uh, this is actually what I am trying to do... here in Africa.
The reason why I am very popular, my policy all over Africa and every African peoples... wants freedom for their people.
They have requested me to tell their leaders... to give them this freedom... and same policy as I did here in Uganda.
Because here I gave...
a completely full economical independence...
to the people of Uganda.
How many crocodiles here?
Very many, yes.
And this is a very good area of the crocodiles.
It is a headquarter of the crocodile, you can see.
You see as it is running very fast.
I think this might be captain of crocodiles.
Yes. He understand me now.
He's moving.
Very big. Yes.
Yes, very good. Yes.
And we are now going, actually, to the headquarters of crocodile, where they lay more eggs... they produce more children.
We are going now.
And it is very attractive.
And you can see here... hundreds of crocodiles.
Thousands of hippo, you see?
Guinea fowls, in there at the edge. You see?
Guinea fowls.
And this elephant is very big.
You see?
And here it is a place where you can found... there is more crocodile than anywhere in the world.
This place.
We say, "How are you?"
Very good.
He is eating.
He is greeting me also.
And even this crocodile is looking at us.
Can I ask you to move?
Uh? Oh, we still want to watch it.
- You want me to ask it to move?
- Yes.
Hey!
You see, it open this... so that the... ants... can go into the mouth and then it eats.
That's why it doesn't want to be disturbed.
He is sleeping.
And most of them, they lay their eggs under this places.
Down there.
You was telling us that you think the Nile...
is a link between your country,
Sudan and Egypt.
But for ages, it has been the problem between the Arabs and the Africans.
The negros.
What do you think of that?
Yes. It has been because the leaders of Arabs... before, they were not revolutionary leaders.
But today, during my time as a revolutionary leader,
I want to bring everybody... in Africa and Arab worlds very closely, and Asia and Europe.
And, therefore, we, the revolutionary leaders, we want to be friendly with all peace-loving people in the world.
And this is highly appreciated very much... by most revolutionary leader in Arab.
That's why you find that, today, there is more unity... between Africa and Arab than before, especially during my tour of Middle East.
I have toured very many countries, and I have brought them together as one family.
You see?
Elephant is dragged into water.
I think it can't get out.
This is a very, very good picture you can get.
This is the most beautiful part... in the continent of Africa.
Used to be called Madison Falls.
But it is now
Kabalega Falls National Park.
That is the one.
And it is a tourist attraction.
I came so close to the Arab... because Arab found that I am most influencing leader... in Africa... in the continent.
And also I am a leader who speaks the truth.
Did your Muslim religion take part...
into your choice of the Arabs?
It is not because of the Muslim... because the people who broke relationship with Israel... they are not only Muslims, they are Christians.
But they have seen the truth.
And everybody listen for me.
And even in O.A.U., if I don't speak, every leader try to ask why, and I must speak.
Like in a nonaligned conference in Algeria...
I was not feeling well.
I did not speak.
But 15 minutes before the conference closed,
I was brought to come and give a speech.
I gave very good speech,
including Castro broke relationship with Israel after my speech.
Telegram sent to Mr. Kurt Waldheim,
permanent secretary of the United Nations. '
"Hitler and all the German people...
"knew that the Israelis are not people who work in the interest of the world,
"and that is why they burnt six millionjews alive with gas...
on the soil of Germany. "
This telegram was sent the day after the Munich killings.
Some years before,
General Amin had undergone,
as had other Ugandans, paratroop training in Israel.
But I'm trained as a paratrooper in Israel.
But I have got a very good brain.
And even General Dayan knows that I am very good field officer.
You knew Dayan very well?
I know him and...
I know him.
He has been my friend.
He has been giving me dinner, lunch in his house.
If I go to Israel,
I used to stay with Dayan.
He brings air force, band playing for me.
We stay together.
But I must make absolutely truth.
The reason why
I chased them from Uganda... was because of the economy of Uganda.
Uganda was going to be bankrupt.
That is the reason why
I chased away the Israelis.
- You were friends with Golda Meir?
- Yes.
Because she used to give me very good entertainment...
when I go to Israel.
Then you changed completely...
from an Israeli alliance to the Arab alliance.
I changed from Israeli alliance... because Israeli are criminals... and they are not trusted people.
They don't tell the world the truth.
They were taken to Palestine as refugees.
And then they changed Palestine to became the State of Israel... by force of arms... given to them by Americans and the British.
But is it true that you said...
Hitler didn't kill enough jews during the war?
Why do you ask me about Hitler?
The Hitler's problem is now past tense.
Now we are looking forward... for the future generations and a future plan.
We are no longer going back to Hitler's.
You see, the war of Hitler... it was a different war than the war today.
If I am to prepare the war against Israel completely, no, I don't want very many... army, air force and navy... just very few.
And I strike inside Israel... and move people from the whole border towards Israel.
I think the situation would be very difficult... and very different.
Strike from inside with paratrooper?
With the paratrooper, with everything, completely.
Yes, because you got to get there by paratrooper... and also bombing by airplanes... and having few squadron of suicide... these who are determined to be suicide.
And I think that is already in progress... and they are practicing.
The suicide squadrons are already in practicing progress.
I think very many delegations meeting me now, preparing for this.
And they come to conclusion.
It is true.
You'll find it here.
And this will change the type of battle.
And we can command from here, not from the battlefield, but through communication.
And will there be Ugandans in those battalions?
I don't know, but any volunteer.
Even France...
French volunteer... they are welcome also.
But I welcome, I welcome any volunteer all over the world.
Even Japanese, even Vietnamese... are there in these squadrons.
But they are now in training.
They are undergoing training now three months.
This is the pilot.
Then go to the Middle East and visit the war... see how they are fighting and encourage them to fight.
This was my decision.
And I enjoy it very much... having breakfast with some Syrians and Iraqi... breakfast in the tanks.
I was very happy.
In October, while I was there,
I was visiting troops. I had my troops.
You had some soldiers up there?
- I had the navy, yes.
- Navy?
- Yes. In Alexandria.
- Navy?
- But you don't have navy...
- We have trained.
- Ah, really?
- Yes.
This is our secret weapon in Lake Victoria.
Marine. Frogmen I think is very good.
Yes.
In '67,you were on the Suez Canal?
Yes, yes. But you see, I am only one who has been in both sides.
During the '67 war,
I was in Suez Canal, on the other side.
And now I am in the Suez Canal in the other side. I like very much.
First, the armored, after crossing the Lake Galilee, reaching the foot of the Golan Heights, they are engaged by the enemy... and the officer... commanding mechanized battalion... ask for the support... by paratroopers and air support.
You understand?
I'm just explaining to you.
And while the armored... and the mechanized regiment are being engaged, the air force gave support... so that the paratrooper land by helicopter... on the Golan Heights and captured Golan Height.
- We go because helicopter coming.
- Okay.
You film. Film helicopter.
Right now the armored regiment... they have been engaged below the Golan Heights.
And the commander of the mechanized regiment... requested for the support.
And, therefore, the paratrooper have been landing, fighting to capture the objectives.
But air will come and give them support.
They will be...
To capture completely the Golan Heights.
Another one is behind you.
Here, here, here.
Left. Now advance.
- Advance!
- Advance!
Here, here.
Victory over Golan Heights.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
The meeting is nonconfidential... because I think that is why you see here... there is... the press people.
They are taping and they wants to make a film... about the cabinet.
But I have about seven points which I think...
I should brief you completely... and tell you to know... exactly what is going on.
One is this:
All of you, you are in very high-ranking governmental positions.
Your duty is not to be very weak.
You must not be like a woman... who is just weak, and he can't speak, even talk.
You must be a person who... to approach everybody as a minister.
You want to know. You must be concerned to know the problems... as a minister, as a governor, as any high-ranking governmental officer.
This is the one point which I must tell you.
You must be concerned in planning ahead for your ministry.
Nobody is to plan for you,
but it is you, with your permanent secretary... and the whole officer under your command, to plan for you, for your minister, in advance.
Not General Amin to tell you... that you go and plan this and this for your ministry.
You should not be like a ministry of foreign affairs.
I'm speaking not even now when Otiang was there.
Because some people who are rotten... they are there since Otiang was there and also he's there.
These people are never been informed since the former regimes.
What they know is to educate people in common man's chatter only, but not proper educating people... of the worl´s the policy of the government.
This I know direct from international people whom I've been sending.
They have been informing me that people have not been educated outside... to know what actually is happening here in Uganda.
And this is the ministry of foreign affair.
This is the weakness of the minister of foreign affair.
Two weeks later,
the body of Michael Ondoga,
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
was found in the Nile.
He was replaced by a former model,
Princess Bagaya,
who holds a law degree from Oxford.
And everybody must be removed... who have got the ideology... or the mentality... of the capitalist... who are no revolutionaries.
I've been informed by the minister of foreign affair... before even Ondoga came that this is good, this is good, must remain there.
But I found they are rotten completely.
They are the one who have been putting even "shameful," but while our position is very good.
We are not bankrupt completely in Uganda.
We are very rich.
I don't want somebody... any minister...
make me good report.
You must only tell me the truth.
This I've been telling you, and now the truth is coming out.
The false report you have been reporting to me is now coming out.
Now I am going to second point.
As a minister,
governor, high-ranking peoples...
and the people of the country,
they must love their leader.
This is the point number one.
If you go to any country, you will find...
that everybody must love his leader.
They must love their ministers.
They must love their governors.
They must love their district commissioners, their teachers, their chiefs.
Everybody must be loved.
This...
It is an education to the people.
This is the duty of the minister.
If I see the minister is a coward, automatically
I kick you out of my office... because I know that you have got something wrong with you.
I will put some another person straight... or any governor or anybody.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
And even whether you hide, you will be known in the light, completely.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
Whether you hide, you go away, you will be known, completely.
But this particular second point is very important.
You must teach people to love their leader.
This is the only most important.
Like any country.
And the people also must love their ministers.
But loving... it is well known in Uganda.
You can't change as a minister.
Number three: Determinations.
You people must work with determinations.
And all other peoples...
you must teach them to work with determinations.
If I go sometime even in the ministry of defense,
I will not find even some commanders there in their offices.
I know this.
I been telephoning several time, checking with them, I can't find.
They are in their business in Kawempe, somewhere in Kampala, what.
You must put your contribution.
If I find you not attend cabinet three times without reason,
you are out of government.
Now, chiefs... Number four.
Chiefs and town agents.
The most important of the chiefs and the town agents, if they are to work very hard, they will help the police, the prison, the air force, the army.
This include the military police.
They will help you, the ministers.
They will not make even police very busy...
because they know who is actually good in the towns,
who is not very good in the town.
If you are to use these people properly... even the police... use these town agent properly...
They are being paid by the government.
They are not just working for nothing.
And marketing here in Kampala...
You must tell our womens in
Uganda to pull up their socks.
I want to see that Ugandans work very hard.
You must not make the womens of Uganda very weak.
They must get up quickly in the morning.
At about 5:00, they are already in nakassero, preparing ready to sell vegetable and everything in the shop.
If you go to Ghana, if you go to Nigeria, you will see that the whole shops, market, everything.
Is Nigeria.
I think you agree with me.
Everybody agree.
Why not here in Uganda?
You must tell our women I said... that the duty of the woman is the house woman.
He knows how to keep house very well.
If he can do that, let me make first examinations, appoint women to be the managers of hotel, which is done.
Because this is a part of the woman's job.
If they can keep house very well, it is exactly like their duty as a housewife.
If he's well-educated, he has got that brain, he is determined, he can look after the hotel very well.
I want to see a woman international hotel... very big one.
Must be woman Ugandans, and I know they can do it.
And you as a minister, you must back them completely.
If you find any man trying to not to obey the order and everything, you can punish that person.
You can remove that person.
You can put loyal people to her to see that we keep up standard.
I think we are the first in our country, in Africa today, who have got many woman managers than other countries.
We have got how many?
- Manager woman.
- Four.
We have got four manager,
and we have got another two assistant manager.
And another point here
I wanted to say.
There is C.I.A. Agents through Africa...
African, black Africans... who are coming here.
And you should know that spy is criminal.
To be an spy is very bad.
And your case is death, completely... sentence.
This I must make it absolutely clear.
If I found anybody is a spy, and any spy is found and anybody he is coming in this cover...
See, I want you to see that everybody must be checked... his poll-tax... for about three or five years.
And if he is found to be spy, his case is firing squad.
He must be handed straight to military police, must be dealt with the military tribunal... because the case of spying is very serious.
Anybody found is a spy, his case must be dealt with military tribunals.
Once he is confirmed, even military tribunals should not waste time... of making law all day, discussing about one person who is a spy.
Must be shortcut.
If minister find him,
don't even report it to me completely...
I don't want the ministers...
should wait anything which he thinks it is good for his ministry.
He is still waiting authority from me.
I don't want.
Then if that, you are not minister.
You are not making decisions.
A minister is a person who must make a decision himself, not wait for General Amin.
You can only inform me what you are doing, what has happened.
I feel very happy.
Because if I am to make a decision all the time, I will be very annoyed.
If you are not well-briefed, come back to me.
Telephone me at 5.'00 or midnight. You telephone me.
Some minister been telephoning me.
I been answering them.
My telephone is simple.
If you telephone me at 2241, whether at 3:00 in the morning,
I get your telephone, I speak to you.
And if you want a briefing,
I can brief you completely until you understand.
And when you go there, any reporters wants to ask you about Uganda,
I think you are well-equipped with all informations.
You can brief them.
You should not fear.
You should not say,
"No, it is not my duty. "
If you are that, you are not Ugandans.
And if I am to get this, you are not minister at all.
As with many other scenes in this film,
the people's welcome in a small garrison town...
was specially-organized for the film.
I am not completely communism, and I am not capitalism because I...
Even very many leaders ask me to join that part.
That part I don't want.
I am only leader who is alone completely... and following on only Uganda.
And this is how we want.
We want just to be free and also friendly... to the capitalism people, friendly to the socialism people.
But we are not going to adopt anything.
But we only choose what is the best from capitalism, from communism, we put in our, our policy of the country.
And this is what we found better.
We are not following any policy at all.
Seven, eight, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Very... Very new gun.
- From guerillas.
- Guerillas?
This captured when we were invaded.
The general has already reviewed these arms several times.
They were captured during an attack in the autumn of 1972 from Tanzania,
organized by former President Obote...
- accompanied by a few hundred men.
- This submachine gun.
Relations with Tanzania have been uneasy since Amin seized power.
He dreamt of getting, by force of arms,
an outlet to the sea taken from Tanzania.
Your Excellence, all these were captured... by our chiefs as our troops were being trained.
These are homemade.
So I think that's how you can explain about that. Your Excellence.
Telegram sent to Julius Nyerere,
President of Tanzania.
"I want to assure you that I love you very much,
"and if you had been a woman,
I would have considered marrying you,
"although your head is full of grey hairs.
But, as you are a man, that possibility does not arise. "
It was then that you sent this telegram to Nyerere?
What was this?
- I think you read my telegram.
- Yes, what was it?
Was it to make fun of him?
Because I love him very much. Yes.
He did not reply me.
He kept quiet.
I lead the country on my best way, how I want them to be lead... according to my democracy, according to my knowledge... and according to my thinking... what is the best way of leading them.
And then I lead them according to that way.
- There's direct contact between you and the people? - Yes, and the people. Yes.
No middle man.
I have 18 children.
Idi Amin had four wives and has 18 children.
He has just repudiated three of his wives for not being revolutionary enough.
Ah, you see?
This one is very rough.
- Yes.
- How old, this one?
- This one?
- Uh? This one and a half year old.
And this...
- And Omonga.
- We have no preference.
This has been to Paris.
He has been to Soviet Union.
And this is still not yet in school, and this and that.
It's difficult to educate 18 children?
- Not very difficult.
- Not difficult?
I have 12 boys... and six girls.
This the one girl and six boys.
I am very good marksman.
But I like children very much.
Yes, they are very happy.
- That's very good.
- Maybe we could sit down there.
With you?
But you can't see the sun proper.
- You want interview me? Yes.
- Yes.
Every evening, there is a news broadcast...
in four languages on television.
The slightest event concerning the president is reported.
During a press conference with French journalists held at the Entebbe Palace,
His Excellency President Amin announced that he was in possession...
of a manual detailing all of the Israeli plans.
Mecca and Medina should be today... under the control of the Israelis.
But because they lost the war in first five days, they couldn't continue even further.
And that is why it stopped.
But their aim is to capture Mecca and Medina.
All the holy places all over the world... should be controlled by the Israelis.
This is their aim.
I have got these books with me.
And I am sure, after we finish here,
I will give you the copy of the book.
But you reading my copy today, here, and you give it back to me... because, if Israeli find it, they will buy the whole copy.
And they don't want the people in the world to see this book.
I will give you. It is here.
Uh, it is a book of the Israelis...
which is the teaching of the elders of the Israelis... of the Zionists.
The book is a fake,
published in 1901 by the Russian secret police.
Millions of copies were printed.
It was required reading in the schools of the Third Reich.
When asked if it was true that the Israelis wanted to poison the Nile,
General Amin replied that they had indeed wanted...
to do so while they were still in Uganda.
They can poison the water...
River Nile... from Uganda... so that the people who will be drinking in the other end, they will die.
General Amin remarked that the plans of the Israelis...
were even more disgusting than Hitler's against thejews.
Dreaming... it has been the true on my side.
Because some people dream which is not the truth.
But I dream the truth.
I dream, when I was still... just none, nothing, completely,
I will be the army commander.
I am commander of the highest man... commander in chief of the armed forces.
I dream I will be the head of state... and the most highest head of state in the world... when I was just none... and it became truth.
I dream completely in Karamonja, in August the fourth, at about 5:00 in the morning, that, if you take decision now... and remove the whole noncitizens... who are being milking the economy of Uganda, this is the only chance Uganda will get.
You must take immediate actions.
I left the place without breakfast, and I went and declare economic war.
And it is true.
Today, the people in Uganda are enjoying.
This is the truth. I dream about, before end of 1975,
Arabs will win the war.
I think I read did you dream people were trying to kill you?
I dream, but it was impossible.
They couldn't do it.
Because I know exactly...
I dream that in...
I know exactly when, how, what time I am going to die.
This I know.
And which year and which date.
All this I know already, and it is a secret.
I have said this clear.
Yes, I know. That is why you find me, I am not a coward... because I know exactly how I am going to die, following all what has been happening.
And I know exactly.
And I can know, sometime, what will happen in the country or to me... in the next few hours or few days.
I know this exactly.
And I know exactly that who will be making something... against me very soon.
I can notice him straight.
And he can get punishment from God straight.
Because I work only according to the Go´s instruction.
And I know exactly that who will be making something... against me very soon.
I can notice him straight.
And he can get punishment from God straight.
Because I work only according to the Go´s instruction.
It is voice of God, and it is not me just speaking, but it is the truth and it is meaningful.
And if you are to follow de Gaulle, he was a very great leader.
Napoleon... very great leader.
Mao Tse-tung is very great leader.
And... this leader whom I'm saying...
- Very great. Who is another you said?
- Qaddafi?
Qaddafi is very popular, whether the people in the Arab worlds in some way against him.
It is impossible, like me.
Here it is impossible.
We already put foundation stone of our... how strong we are in the worlds.
And the people understand.
And even I am still fighting... for the whole black people all over the worlds... in Caribbeans, in Negro Americans, all over the world, which I am still fighting for them.
And they respect me very much and very highly.
And they were taken to America as slaves... those people.
They did not want to go there.
And this is their country, but they were taken by force.
Therefore, nobody should remove them from there.
They must get independent in America, and they must control the Americans.
The black people in America... must be the president of the United States of America... must be the secretary of state, like Kissinger.
They are more brilliant... than the Dr. Kissinger.
Kissinger is not very intelligent.
Kissinger always go to the weakest leaders.
He never go to Qaddafi.
He never come to General Amin.
He fears us. You see?
This is what Kissinger is going.
He goes only to the weakest leaders.
Because he know there is the strongest leaders in Uganda.
And he will never go to Uganda.
- They are afraid of you?
- Yes.
Because I speak the truth, and I know their mistake.
I know their mistake, and I know how to teach the America their mistake.
On speaking of the Americans, the general said...
that he had in his possession certain equipment they used...
to spy on the Russian and Chinese embassies.
He noted that President Nixon wanted to export Watergate to Uganda.
And you see, this is the mistake of Nixon... of Watergate.
He was bringing in Uganda, taping all embassies...
Chinese embassies, Russian embassies.
All this problem was brought by...
And thaØs why they left...
because they got afraid when you discovered the thing?
That is why they run away from me.
And I say that how can 250 million... run away from only General Amin?
That I am very powerful than Americans.
I have no Phantoms.
- But you have MIGs.
- Hmm?
I have a brain.
Because I discover their mistake in advance.
Because my brain work in advance than them.
When I come out, we have to capture this port.
Eh? Everyone must reach this port.
- We are diving.
- I am not diving.
- just a jump.
- If you dive down, we cut you.
You must jump here and then start this straight.
Ready? You do now.
You give us green light.
Give us the time too. Ready? Go.
Very good.
I won.
I have seen the whole African... how they suffered, including my father and everybody.
- I know this very well.
- Can you tell a story?
- Hmm?
- Can you tell a story with that?
- I will just give you simple.
- An example.
People used to carry British on their heads.
British used to send...
They make something like a stretcher... and put chair on top.
And then they used to carry
British for miles and miles.
This is African carry.
And they used to dig holes and everything.
They used to carry when the British was here.
And the Africans, when they make a mistake, they used to be beaten by canes, completely, by the British.
You should like to see Mr. Heath?
I would be... I will never talk to anybody from Britain... if Mr. Heath himself does not come to me here.
Yes, here in Uganda, because I declared economic war here in Uganda.
And I will see him in command post. Not anybody.
If Mr. Heath does not come, then it is not my problem.
It is up to him.
It is up to him now to beg me.
If he doesn't beg me, it is up to him.
Because I am the one who has got the money.
I am not going to borrow money from him.
Even I don't want, I am getting millions of shillings.
Uganda is getting from selling their crops... and everything every years.
British now, actually...
They are in chaos, as you know.
Their economic is in chaos, completely.
I think if I am really British,
I could run to France... and ask the financial and assistant in France.
It is just your neighbor there.
You should help them.
Like, I am very far away from London.
But I am helping them. I am collecting.
I am appealing for everybody in the world to assist the British.
We made a collect of over 43,000 shilling.
And what Mr. Heath said?
- Mr. Heath?
- About this collect.
Uh, he said...
He hasn't replied me yet.
- He hasn't?
- Yes.
I am very annoyed.
I am waiting for his reply so that...
I have requested him for airplane... so that I can send the food.
Because some people donated food lorry of vegetable.
Three tons to be given to the friends in Britain.
But he hasn't send airplane yet.
But maybe it will be deteriorated?
I don't know. It is up to him... because I had sent on the very day they donated the food.
I have very many friends in Britain.
It is only the problem
I had to put to them.
That is why they have more problem.
You see there? I'm trying to help.
Even myself,
I donated 10,000 shilling...
from my own saving to Save the British Fund.
We have opened the fund here...
Save the British Fund.
Yes.
I wanted to... make... special language in black America of African... because I wanted to... brainwash them from British colonials.
And I wanted to make them understand one language in America.
I might introduce Swahili... to all black American... to understand this language in America.
You laid the stone of a foundation...
of a new broadcasting station.
Which country will it cover?
It will cover including France.
Including everybody,
I think, in Europe, in America, in Soviet Union,
China, everywhere.
It will cover...
So that in all Africa... people will listen for radio broadcast... from Uganda, direct.
This is very important.
Will you speak in English or...
No, it is going to be Swahili,
English, French, Arabic.
This is four official language will be spoken.
English, French, Arabic and Swahili.
Would you accept some Palestinian hijackers...
with their hostages in Uganda?
- The Palestinians?
- Yes, I read in the papers...
they were asking to be sent to Uganda or to Libya.
If they are sent here,
I would welcome them.
Because we believe in peace.
And that is why in the United Nations... they have already passed... one of the agenda... that the Black September should be treated... as prisoner of war, but not as the criminal... because they are fighting for their cause.
So you will put them in prison if they come here?
I don't know whether
I will put them in prison, but I know how I will keep them.
But they are welcome.
- In Uganda?
- Yes.
If they want to come to Uganda, they are welcomed in Uganda.
They have got representative.
Having expelled the Israelis,
General Amin installed the Palestinians...
in the former Israeli embassy.
But the people in some planes are innocent.
But you must not go in the airplane... which is belonging to Israelis, to Portuguese, to South Africa.
If you use these airplane, then it is up to you.
You must choose because the airplane is booked in advance.
You must know this.
It is not
Black September's mistake.
It is the people's mistake... because they are the one who choose what airplane they should fly in.
You must fly in Air France.
You must fly in East African Airway.
This is very good.
Faced with fines or imprisonment,
the naked tribesmen of Karamonja...
are forced to wear clothes.
Women are forbidden to wear wigs,
trousers or miniskirts.
General Amin has planned to group together...
the idle and unemployed and make them work in cooperatives.
You can actually educate people through traditional dance... how to make very good garden like this.
It will be in the song.
When you are singing, people are watching.
You talk about the flower. You must make very good garden in your house.
You must have house with big latrines.
Make it clean. People will understand.
"Oh, this song has got meaning.
I must go and make this. "
And you must boil the water before you drink... because you might have disease in the stomach.
You are helping doctor.
You understand?
You must work hard.
You must produce more foods... for export, for selling to get more money... and for your self reserve in case of dry season.
Hot sun.
You will have a reserve food in your store.
You will not die from hunger.
You are all right for your communication?
Yes, sir.
That's very good.
As a pilot, you must know... your all techniques within the aircraft.
You must know map reading very well, completely.
You must be ready to go and fight...
in any part of Africa...
which is still under imperialist domination...
if you have been directed to go... with other forces of the O.A.U. Members.
This is the one of the things.
But you are still to go for another intensive training.
You are to go for another... fastest airplane than this one.
You are to go.
Only one pilot, if he is to do his duty properly,
he can really make a big destructions.
And also, as a pilot, when you are going to fight, you must not think... that you are going back to the base.
But you must fly while knowing...
that you are going to complete your mission.
But if, God bless you, you go back... back to the base.
Amin gets ready to face...
a much more critical audience than his usual audiences.
It is a gathering of the capital's eminent physicians.
Indulge a private practice...
and to fight the economic war.
There has been growing concern in the public...
about some doctors who have located surgeries...
and others who have located private businesses...
have been spending most or a lot of their time...
and much of their attention...
was increasingly being drawn...
to their businesses in their private surgeries.
First, I would like to thank you for what you have been doing.
You have been doing very well.
And to be a doctor is not very easy thing, right from the time you have been born.
Because you went through difficult... through primary schools.
And you have been very intelligence.
You pass your primary school.
You went to secondary schools.
You pass.
You went into higher school.
You pass.
You proved to be very intelligent.
And that is why you have been selected... to be a doctor.
I know this very well because
I come from very poor family.
I know how... the person can come... right from the village level... up to the top standard of the doctor.
It is very difficult.
And don't spoil that chance.
When you have reached this standard, what you should do... you should practice more.
You should specialize... in some more fields... so that you will be able to help... and assist the people in the country.
And, as a doctor, you must be very clean, very smart.
You behave very well like a person.
And also, you are not too drunk.
You are the one who should advise the public.
You should advise General Amin not to drink.
This is very important.
This is the most important, because if a public learn... that you are drunkard,
automatically they lose confidence.
And even they can say that, if I am going to get operation by that doctor, he is a drunkard, he will not do anything good for me.
And they will completely refuse.
I am telling you sincerely.
And it is true. I must be frank to you and tell you this.
Because, also, to drink and overdrunk... it is not very good.
You will not even enjoy more.
Because you will not even have sense.
But if you drink very little, you feel very happy, very proud, and you talk to the people.
That will be... I'm just advising you.
If I am a commander of operations...
I wanted to fight... in Lugasi sugar factory.
I just giving you this.
Okay. There is enemy there.
What I want to use... air force.
What I will ask...
I will call the engineers.
I will call the pilots... and talk to them.
Can you, from this base and this base... can you reach Lugasi, come back without refilling?
Yes. How long can you fight there?
Give me timing.
This technicians will be in position, advising before I give any order.
And they tells me completely everything... how long they will be there and how long they will fight... and what is the number of the enemy and all this.
Then I write all this, discussing with the technician.
This is like a public service commission.
When they want to recruit the doctors, they come to you, you advise them.
But it is your duty as a doctor... to advise them properly... and your duty as a doctor... to advise your representative... who can represent you or myself or him properly... so that when he takes, he brings the points... concerning the medical field in the cabinet to me,
I have a full report... submitted to me, not only by him, but by you, the technicians.
Because you know the whole technical problem.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
You have any points to tell me?
Yes?
Your Excellence,
I'm quite happy to have heard...
that you are quite ready...
to be listening to the senior doctors.
Not only the senior doctors, but the young doctors, for the lives of the citizens are in their hands.
In Uganda, the Uganda Medical Association... seems to be the main spokesman...
for every doctor all over the country.
The president of our association...
In Uganda, only Amin is allowed to be called president.
You leave him to speak.
- I withdraw the title...
- I am... I...
I am General Amin.
The chairman of our association,
who is a very active person,
who I am sure was not concerted about these rumors...
which have been floating around...
about the private surgeries in town.
So much so that he was...
and ourselves seriously caught unaware...
of what is happening.
With due respect to the minister,
Your Excellency,
and your technicians in Entebbe,
I would like to tell you that our chairman...
is quite fluent with the problems affecting the doctors...
on public health.
I would, therefore,
request you, kindly and humbly,
to keep him in mind...
that, whenever there is any big problem...
that concerns a doctor,
if you take off your permanent secretary...
and if you are assistant immediate to him,
the next man to consult...
should be the chairman of the Uganda Medical Association.
Thank you very much.
I like this type of frank discussions.
And it is very good.
Um, I am sure... that I informed the permanent secretary...
I will be addressing... the senior doctors... within three days.
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
And if somebody loved me like she done me
Ooh she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh she done me
She done me good
Vamos cantar só a música melada.
Sim, a música melada...
Só prá terminar esta parte e depois...
sei lá, sabem, nós fazemos melhor quando...
Mas não se não houver continuidade e ficarmos dando voltas.
Eu sei, então vamos em frente agora.
Agora, mais uma Bang
Bang Maxwell's Hammer.
Está realmente me deixando afiado...

Bang Bang Maxwell's Silver Hammer
Made sure that Joan was dead...
Back in school again
Maxwell is the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay late when they're gone away
Teacher stays behind
Writin' a thousand lines
"I must not ow ow ow..."
But as she turn 'round ow ow ow
Yeah...
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
So...yeh...
Bang, bang, Maxwell....
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that Maxwell's dead...
Ok...
Fotos para o álbum!
Na verdade é um pouco...
Choques eletronicos?!
Jim, posso chamar sua atenção?
Ele levou um choque!
Acabei de levar um choque aqui.
Tudo isso!
Como aconteceu George?
Eu segurei nos dois juntos.
Segure firme na ponta dos dois.
Não aconteceu nada.
Agora cante neles.
Começou assim...
E também estou usando sapatos de borracha.
E você é feito de madeira?
Segure-os ao mesmo tempo e veja o que acontece.
Deixe-me tentar novamente.
É óbvio que tem algo a ver com a sua guitarra.
Certo, mas ela está desligada.
Aposto que não.
Se esse rapaz morrer você estará em apuros.
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall.
You and me burning papers, standing....on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
....in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're goin' home
On our way home back home
On our way home back home
On our way home back home
We're goin' home!
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody let their hair down
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up
Ev'rybody put their foot down
Yeah I've got a feeling.
Está descendo demais a nota.
Não...
Deveria ser... sem pulos.
Tente descendo, descendo, assim...
Vamos tentar comigo cantando.
OK, então vamos com a parte do meio.
1, 2, 3, 4...
All these years
I've been wandering around
Wonderin' why how come nobody told me
All that I been lookin' for was somebody
Who looked like you. Oh!
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
I've got a feeling,
I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got a feeling, yeah
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah yeah
I've got a feeling!
A rainha disse "Não" aos caras do FBI que fumam maconha.
Oh, Darling!
Please, believe me!
Adorável, isso é ótimo.
Uma verdadeira viagem no túnel do tempo.
Paul, em que música você estava trabalhando na noite passada?
Era "One after 909".
Ah, sim, é fantástica.
Ótimo!
Qual?
Na verdade, eu nunca considerei essa...
pois foi uma das primeiras músicas que fizemos.
Nós matávamos as aulas...
e íamos prá minha casa depois da escola.
Nós dois nos sentamos e a escrevemos
"Love me do''
'Too Bad About Sorrows'
E há muita coisa daquela época.
Há umas 100 canções daquela época que nem considerávamos
porque não eram sofisticadas como...
"They said our love was just fun...
the day that our friendship begun...
There's no blue moon that I can see...
there's never been in history."
Mas isso é ótimo, sabe, são boas...
E tem outra...
é que nós sempre odiamos a letra de one after 909.
"Baby said She's travelling on the one after 909...
"She said move over honey,
I'm traveling on that line...
"I said move over honey...
"Move over twice...
"Come on baby, don't be cold as ice.
Move over once,
Move over twice.
C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice,
Said she's travellin' on one after 909
Well I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee
Said you're only fooling around, only fooling around with me
Railman said: you got the wrong location.
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find,
I've got the number wrong
Move over once,
Move over twice.
C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice,
Said she's travellin' on one after 90...
Said she's travellin' on one after 90...
Said she's travellin' on one after 909
- Bom dia, Paul.
- Bom dia, Rich.
- Como você está esta manhã?
- OK!
Well, I bought the piano the other day
I didn't know what songs to play
I had to play the older theme
Oh! baby...
Pronto, eu já terminei.
Bom, já troquei...
OK, vamos fazer de novo desde o início.
1, 2, 3, 4...
Chegue mais perto do microfone.
É que eu não estou ouvindo você.
Tá legal, você manda...
Sabem, nós ficamos só dando voltas por uma hora e não fizemos nada.
Os ''riffs'', não há ''riffs''.
Mas você e eu...
"You and I are memories..."
"Memories" não está em sintonia...
Mas nós podemos tocar até...
ou podemos parar e dizer que não está sintonizado.
Se tivéssemos um gravador aqui...
você jogaria isso fora na hora.
Sim, certo, mas está complicado agora.
Então, vamos simplificar...
e depois complicar onde precisar de complicação.
Não é complicado...
Eu tocarei somente o que você quiser.
Não, você sempre se irrita e eu só estou tentando ajudar.
mas sempre acabo te irritando.
Eu estou tentando...
Não, você não me irrita de jeito nenhum.
vai demorar mais se você...
Olha, eu não estou dizendo isso...
e você está fazendo parecer que quero dizer isso.
Lembra do que falamos outro dia?
Eu não estou querendo provocar você.
Estou tentando dizer: vamos gente!
O grupo!
vamos tentar desta forma?
É estranho que...
Nessa música você estava tocando como tocou em Hey Jude
e eu acho que...
Não me importo, eu tocarei o que você quiser...
e também nem toco nada se você não quiser.
Eu só vou fazer o que e como você quiser.
Podemos ouvir agora como ficaram as gravações.
Será que é porque não estamos a fim...
ou a parte da guitarra ficou boa?
vamos tentar com menos...
Nothing's gonna change my...
vamos cantar uma vez...
e depois duas no final.
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Jai Guru Deva On
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Ah-ha... I

You can celebrate anything you want
You can celebrate anything you want
Because...
Ah-ha-ha I pick a hound dog
You can celebrate anything you want
You can celebrate anything you want
Because...
All I want is you...
Dig a pony!
Alguém tem uma música rápida?
Well come on Suzy's Parlour, everybody's welcome to come
Said come on Suzy's Parlour, everybody's welcome to come
(Come Suzy Parker, come, Suzy Parker)
When you get to Suzy's Parlour everybody gets well done
(Come Suzy Parker, come, Suzy Parker)
I said go little Suzy
I said go little Suzy
I said go little Suzy
I said Da Da Da Da...
Com'on little Suzy, everybody gets well done!
Chama-se ''I Me Mine''.
Quer que eu cante prá você?
Não me importo se não a quiser no seu show.
Pode colocá-la num musical...
É uma valsa pesada.
All thru' the day
I Me Mine, I Me Mine, I Me Mine!
All thru' the night
I Me Mine, I Me Mine, I Me Mine!
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Ev'ryone's weaving it,
Coming on strong all the time,
All thru' the day I me mine.
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Ev'ryone's saying it,
Flowing more freely than wine,
All thru' the day
I me mine.
I-I-me-me mine,
I-I-me-me mine,
I-I-me-me mine,
I-I-me-me mine,
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
No-one's frightened of playing it
Ev'ryone's saying it,
Flowing like wine,
All thru' your life...
I me mine.
Because you're sweet and lovely,
I love you,
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I want you in the morning girl
I love you,
I want you at the moment
I feel blue,
I'm living ev'ry moment girl for you.
Because you're sweet and lovely girl
I love you.
Because you're sweet and lovely girl
It's true!
I love you more than ever girl I do.
"I Dig A Pigmy" de Charles Hawtry e seus assistentes surdos...
Capítulo Um, no qual Doris faz sexo.
Eu vou inventando...
Sabe o Capítulo Dois...
Ah, assisti a um filme ontem à noite.
O Que?
Estava na casa do Maharishi.
Eu tenho o filme inteiro.
Incrível.
Ele tem um início excelente.
O trecho com o helicóptero no ar?
É, eu vi você entrando nele.
É incrível como ele retrata tudo o que estamos fazendo.
O que vocês estavam fazendo?
O que estávamos fazendo?
Eu realmente não sei...
exceto que deixamos nossas personalidades de lado.
Nós não éramos muito verdadeiros.
Sabe, nós podíamos como que...
nos escondermos atrás de alguém na escola.
E você pode ver no filme que é bem parecido...
com a escola e deveríamos ter falado.
você deve chamar o filme de...
"O que fizemos em nossas férias''.
Bem, sabe...
Aposto que não vai chamá-lo assim.
Há uma cena bem distante com você andando...
com o Maharishi e não parece você.
Sabe, do tipo "Conte-me velho Mestre!"
E aquela outra coisa que você disse.
Quando você subiu no helicóptero com ele...
e pensou que talvez ele te dissesse a resposta.
Besame...
Besame mucho
(Each time I kiss your lips
I hear music divine)
Besame...
Besame mucho
Love me forever and say that you'll always be mine!
Little one,
Hold me so closely. when I am kissin' your lips
I am feeling divine.
Besame...
Besame mucho
Love me forever and say that you'll always be mine!
Oh this joy is something new,
My arms enfolding you,
I never knew this thrill before.
I'd be Holding you... closer I'd be holdin' you...
Never felt this way before cha-cha-boom, love me forever and say that you'll always...
...be mine!
"Toda vez que o vejo ele diz olá e entra."
"Cada vez que o vejo ele diz olá".
"Mas tenho que partir!"
Faça assim e volte aqui...
E dai vai para ré menor...
E depois volta para dó.
Vou tocar o violão.
I'd like to be underneath the sea
In an octopus' garden by the shade
It would nice... paradise
In an octopus' garden by the shade
I'd like to be underneath the sea
In an octopus' garden by the shade
It would nice... paradise
In an octopus' garden by the shade
In an octopus' garden by the shade
Já tocou a bateria do Octopus?
Sim, terrível...
Terrível.
É bateria rudimentar?
Sim e muito rudimentar...
mas Get Back ficou ótimo.
Eu deixei minha guitarra.
A única música boa foi Get Back.
Mas não foi nada especial.
Isadora DunKan trabalhava na TelefunKen.
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always thinkin' of you
Oh oh oh
You do me badly
My love's strong now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

Baby...I love you and all I want you to do is just...
Hold me...

Hold me!
Hold me!

The long and winding road that leads to your door
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here lead me to your door!
But still they lead me back... the long and winding road!
Vamos lá, rapazes...
Chega, senão não paramos mais.
The long and winding road that leads to your door.
Yeah, alright...
Will never disappear!
Mal, você vai ter que conseguir...
todos estes instrumentos afinados em conjunto.
O órgão e piano têm que...
ser afinados juntos.
Flyin' high..
Don't mind to the groovy sky...
I don't care if I spent my dough
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul.
Gonna rock it up!
Gonna shake it up!
We're gonna roll it up.
Oh, at the ball tonight.
Rattle and roll,

You never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.
Well, get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
Well, get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul,
You're the devil in a frying pan.
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
You never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.
Hey, yeah, com'on shake!
I'm a one-eyed cat, peepin' in a sea-food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat, peepin' in a sea-food store
I can do the shake, tell you don't love me no more!
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
You never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.

Like a Rolling Stone
Like a Rolling Stone
Like a Rolling Stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA and the BBC
B.B. King and Doris Day!
Matt Busby
Dig it! Dig it! Dig it! Dig it!
Dig it! Dig it! Dig it! Dig it!
Dig it, if you want it, if you get it, if you want it, if you need it,
If you asked for, anytime of the day!
Come on!
C'mon and dig it!
Any time of day...
Any time of night!
Can you dit it in the morning,
Dig it every evening...
Dig it everytime of day if you want it all you gotta do is ask for...nicely!
It's free and you're gonna get it
You're gonna get it, all right!
And you're gonna get it!
Yeah, you're gonna get it
And yes you're gonna get it good!
Yeah yeah yeah!
That was "Can you dig it?" by George Wood.
Sempre que conversamos discutimos...
Veja essa do George.
Perguntei o que ele queria fazer...
e ele disse "nada de filmes".
Mas isto está errado, muito errado.
Porque nunca se sabe...
Nada parecido com "Help!" ou
"A Hard Day's Night",
eu concordo...
Mas filmes ?
Isto aqui é um filme!
Agora ele não se importa em fazer este?
Mas esse tipo de coisa que ele diz...
nada de televisão, nada de platéia.
Quero dizer que quando voltamos de Hamburgo,
e fizemos Leicester du Montford Hall,
ou Coventry.
Tocávamos em salões de bailes...
e tivemos a primeira pior noite imaginável.
Estávamos todos nervosos e foi terrível.
E na noite seguinte, tocamos novamente...
e foi um pouco melhor.
e a noite seguinte... e a próxima...
foi demais, e tocamos bem,
e nos acostumamos com a platéia...
e parecia que não havia mais ninguém lá.
Era uma nova sensação...
e tinha um cara em frente vendo você tocar...
e nós estávamos ligados.
E aqueles shows, se tivessem sido gravados,
seriam os melhores.
Porque na minha opinião,
é aquela coisa de equilíbrio.
E uma vez que o nervosismo passa,
nós somos bons nisso.
Mas parece que aquela barreira do nervosismo...
está aqui agora...
e não estamos conseguindo...
superá-la desta vez.
A não ser que fôssemos ao Albert Hall...
e fizéssemos um show.
A única alternativa é dizer...
que nunca mais iremos tocar...
diante de uma platéia.
Mas se pretendemos manter...
algum tipo de contato nesse cenário...
Bem, entendo quando o George diz que não faz sentido...
porque é como Stravinsky.
E está na música...
E as guitarras nunca mais se levantarão e tocarão.
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard earned pay,
You and me Sunday driving,
Not arriving on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall.
You and me burning matches,
Lifting latches on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're goin' home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're goin' home.
Goodbye!
We're on our way home.
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be!
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
There will be an answer, let it be.
And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me,
There will be no sorrow, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be.
There will be no sorrow, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door.
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way.
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried,
Anyway you've always known the many ways I've tried,
But still they lead me back to the long winding road,
You left me waiting here a long, long time ago.
Don't keep me standing here, lead me to your door.
But still they lead me back to the long winding road,
You left me waiting here a long, long time ago.
Don't leave me standing here lead me to your door!
Lugar bem seguro aqui, não acha?
Mal!
Você me pregou no lugar errado.
Pode pegar o clapper.
Pegue o clapper, oK?
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson,
Arizona
For some California Grass.
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo...
Go home!
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can.
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta!
Your mother's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back Loretta!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back, get back!
Get back home!
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back home
Every morning roam...
Get back, get back!
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back...
Get back to where you once belonged.
Recebemos um pedido de Daisy,
Morris e Tommy.
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Ooh she does. Yes she does
And if somebody loved me
Like she do me
Ooh she do me. Yes she does
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
And....
Ooh she does, yes she does!
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh she done me
She done me good
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down.
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Acho que os Beatles são demais.
Não existe ninguém melhor.
Eles são únicos.
Eles têm uma estrela própria.
E na minha opinião, eles são uns caras legais,
muito bons e cantam bem.
E o que mais posso dizer?
São todos gente muito boa.
Yeah I've got a feeling.
Oh please believe me
I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me
I won't be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah I've got a feeling yeah.
All these years
I've been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.
Isso não faz sentido!
Sim, acho ótimo, quero dizer,
deixa o trabalho do escritório mais excitante.
Esse tipo de música é legal e agradável mas no seu devido lugar.
Só que é um grande abuso eles atrapalharem tudo por aqui.
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a good year,

Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

É bom ter algo de graça neste país no momento, não é?

Ótimo! Tenho apenas 5.
My baby says she's travelin' on the One after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm traveling on the One after Nine-O-Nine.
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm traveling on the One after 909!
I've got my bag,
Run to the station.
Railman says
"you got the wrong location!"
I've got my bag.
Run right home.
Then I find...
I've got the number wrong,
Well I said I'm travelin' on the One after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said we're traveling on the One after 909...
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman said
"You got the wrong location!"
I got my bag
Run right home!
Then I find,
I got the number wrong
Said we're travellin' on the one after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice...
Said we're travellin' on the one after 90...
Said we're travellin' on the one after 90...
Said we're travellin' on the one after 909
Oh Danny Boy, the oats of Anne are calling!"

Because...
All I want is you!
Obrigado pelo ensaio...
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson,
Arizona
For some California Grass.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can.
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta.
Get back home
C'mon, go home!
Your mother's waiting,
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Yeh, get back!
You've been out too long, Loretta!
Você está tocando no telhado e isso não é muito bom!
Sua mãe não vai gostar disso,
E vai ficar brava!
E vai mandar prender você!
Então volte!
Get back!
Yeah yeh yeh...
Get back, get back!
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back!
Obrigado Mal!
Agradeço em meu nome e do grupo e...
espero que tenhamos passado no teste.
And it is told how once...
...the earth swayed in deep quiet...
...swayed in deep silence, r ested in stillness...
...softly r ocking, and lay ther e, lonely and void.
And this is the first testimony...
...the first word.
Ther e was no man...
... nor beast, fowl, fish, crab, tr ee...
...stone, cave, gorge, grass-tuft, nor bush...
Only the heavens wer e ther e. lnvisible was the face of the earth.
Only the seas gather ed under the firmament...
That was all.
Nothing was ther e to take form...
...or become audible...
... nothing to move, trickle...
...or rush under the firmament.
Ther e was only the nothingness.
Only the waters gather ed together...
...only the sea lay calmly ther e, one single surging sea.
Truly nothing was ther e, which might otherwise have existed.
Only the cr eatr ess was ther e and the cr eator...
...the Mighty and Cucumatz,
Herself, the child-bear er...
...and the begetter of sons wer e ther e upon the unfathomable waters.
Omniscient and omnipotent was their essence.
And likewise ther e truly was Heaven...
...and also the ''Heart of Heaven'' ...
...this is the name of the God...
...this is how He is named.
And his word came thither...
... unto the Mighty and to Cucumatz...
...wher e ther e was darkness and night...
...and talked to the Mighty and to Cucumatz.
And they talked and bethought themselves...
...and consider ed car efully, took council among themselves...
...and br ought their words and considerations into accord.
Ther e emerged fr om their plans the dawning of a light...
...and the conception of man.
And then they ponder ed the spr outing, the gr owing of tr ees and cr eepers...
...the springing up of life...
...and the cr eation of mankind in darkness and night.
...on the str ength of Him, who is the ''Heart of Heaven'' ...
...and whose name is Huracan.
Huracan-flash-of-lightning is his first appearance...
...the second is
Tom-thumb-lightning...
...the third, at last, is gr een-lightning.
By these thr ee is the
''Heart of Heaven'' encompassed.
And they came to the Mighty and to Cucumatz...
...and consider ed light and life...
''ln what manner shall life be sown...
...and how shall light shine?
Who shall be our ward and keeper?
O that it may come to pass!
This thou shalt ponder!
Recede o ye waters, abate ye fr om the earth!
Let ther e be earth and her union...
...and she shall become level...
...so that life can be sown...
...so that light shall be in heaven and on earth.
For ther e is no splendor nor r enown, nor glory...
... in this, our work, our cr eation...
... lest man be built, man be cr eated.''
Thus spake they.
And earth was cr eated by them.
Y es indeed, thus it came forth.
So that earth might come forth they said...
...''Earth'', and at once it appear ed.
Mer ely like a cloud, like unto a haze when it first took shape...
... in its first manifestation.
Then the mountains wer e heard rising out of the waters...
...and they wer e majestic instanter.
And Cucumatz r ejoiced...
...''lt was good that thou camest down unto us...
...thou 'Heart of Heaven', thou Huracan...
...thou Tom-thumb-lightning, thou gr een-lightning!''
''Our cr eation and our work will be well-made,'' spake they.
Earth, the mountains, the plains thus came forth.
And everywher e the courses of the rivers wer e set...
They meander ed and wound...
...at the foot of the mountains and between them.
Well-parted the rivers wer e...
...after the high mountains had come forth into light.
Thus came this earth into being.
And further they now thought out the beasts of the mountains...
...the keepers of all for ests, the inhabitants of the mountains...
...the stag, fowl, puma, and jaguar...
...the snake, rattle-snake, and viper, the wards of the cr eepers.
And the child-bear er and the begetter of the sons spake...
''Shall it be all void...
...shall it be all still under the tr ees and cr eepers?
Would not it be wise now...
...to have somebody watch over them?'' spake they...
... bethinking themselves and taking council the one with the other.
At once the stag and the fowl wer e shaped...
...and now they showed the stag and the fowl their habitation...
''Thou, stag, shalt sleep near the course of the river, in the gorges...
... her e thou shalt dwell, betwixt grass-bushels and herbs. ln the for ests shalt thou multiply!
Let it be so !'' they said unto them.
Then the small birds and the big birds r eceived their abode...
''Y e birds of the tr ee-tops and the cr eepers...
... may ye dwell and nest her e !
Her e may ye br eed and multiply on the branches of the tr ees...
...and on the tendrils and cr eepers.''
So it was told to the stags and the fowl.
Thus was the earth haunted by them...
...and each was given his bed and his r esting place. ln this manner, the child-bear er and begetter of sons...
...gave the beasts of the earth their habitation...
...thus all the stags and fowl became alive.
And the stags and fowl wer e told by the cr eatr ess and the cr eator...
... by the child-bear er and the begetter of sons...
''Speak orderly...
...do not clamor or shout without sense...
...speak coher ently...
...everyone in his manner...
...everyone after his family...
...everyone after his kind.''
However, it came to pass that they spake...
... not as human beings would.
When the cr eatr ess and cr eator heard...
...that they failed to speak as human beings do...
...they said to each other...
''They have not in the least master ed the calling of our names...
...although we ar e their constructors and their cr eators.
That is not in order.''
Ther efor e the cr eatr ess and the cr eator...
...essayed once mor e...
...to build living beings, to make moving cr eatur es.
''Without fail let us try anew!''
Time dr ew near for the dissemination of man and for the illumination.
''Let us build ourselves a keeper!''
The flesh of man was made of tzite-wood...
... but when woman was carved by the cr eatr ess and the cr eator...
...the flesh of woman was made of r eed-grass marr ow.
But still the cr eatur es wer e without sense...
...they spake not befor e the face of their cr eatr ess and their cr eator...
...who made them, who formed them.
And so wer e they destr oyed, dr owned.
For their sakes, the face of the earth was darkened.
Ther e r eigned a rain-darkness...
... pelting-rain by day, and pelting-rain by night.
Small beasts and big beasts flocked together.
Tr ees and r ocks cried shame upon them.
They determined to climb up the huts...
... but the huts made them tumble, and they fell.
They determined to hide in the caves...
... but the caves closed befor e them. ln this manner the second destruction of the beings formed...
...or cr eated like man took place...
...of the beings which ar e doomed to perish, to fall.
They wer e extinguished...
...they wer e all, r oot and branch, destr oyed.
Now ''Flying Robert'' appears small at the horizon...
... umbr ella in hand, his hair teased by the wind...
...wet-thr ough and shaken...
... rigid and sad like no other. ln Paradise you cr oss the sand without seeing your shadow.
Ther e is a landscape even without deeper meaning.
Paradise is available to everybody. ln Paradise only God is looking on.
Ther e you cr oss the sand without seeing your face.
Ther e is landscape even without deeper meaning.
The gates of Paradise ar e open to everybody.
Ther e, works ar e inspected which no one would do.
Ther e you dig holes without stumbling on man.
Ther e you slake lime and ar e chosen for this task by the rich.
Ther e, men cast a shadow in spite of the scorching sun.
Afterwards rar e animals wer e seen ther e. l only have 16 years left...
...to explor e how these monitors...
...can endur e the heat of the sun and still find food.
They live off of the few living beings that exist in this desert...
...smaller lizards and mice...
...who, in the daytime, ar e hidden away in their burr ows in the sand.
They ar e generally large pr edators.
Which you can see by the many flies which ar e gathering her e. l've alr eady been away fr om
Germany for 15 years.
Dear Eugen, we have r eceived your letter very much. How ar e you?
How's life in the hot country?
How ar e you? lsn't it too hot ther e?
When ar e you coming back?
Y es, l am coming back.
A dime.
A dime.
Five bucks or nothing.
Well, ther e ar e certain species...
...of fat tailed sheep which we count on a lot.
They can endur e such incr edible temperatur es...
...of appr oximately 122°F and 140°F.
But ther e ar e only a few.
Some birds ar e able to cool down by taking flight.
But otherwise, you hardly find any life her e.
The desert doesn't make it easy to catch these animals.
For days you have to march thr ough the dunes and the wind...
...to find the monitors. lndividual animals run away at incr edible speeds...
...and try to escape into their burr ows.
And then you have to dig them out with a shovel in this heat. lt's not fun.
But then again, what wouldn't you do to find out about these animals? ln Paradise r oasted pigeons fly dir ectly into your mouth.
Ther e you enjoy yourself without being forced to.
Ther e, enjoyment means obligation. ln enjoyment, man finds himself in Paradise.
The ''Blitzkrieg'' is insanity. ln Paradise even gentiles move mountains.
Ther e, wars ar e pr evented by mothers.
Ther e you expect her ons fr om the left. ln Paradise ruins mean happiness.
Ther e you find gates without borders. ln Paradise plane-wr ecks have been distributed in the desert in advance.
Ther e the landscape is as
God has commanded it to be. ln Paradise you call ''hello'' without seeing anybody.
Ther e you quarr el with strangers to avoid having friends. ln Paradise man is born dead.
While you ar e sleeping...
...acids gnaw and leeches suck at the tuna-fish.
While you ar e dr eaming, an apple fr om a tr ee falls onto your br ow.
While you ar e waiting, trains br eak in two...
...you br eathe softly, as though you wer e dead.
While you r ecline...
...car elessly str ewn stars look out into space.
While you ar e sleeping...
...God softly walks over the fields with Maria. ln the Golden Age, man and wife live in harmony.
Now, for ex ample, they appear befor e the lens of the camera...
...death in their eyes, a smile on their faces, a finger in the pie.
Running, they train themselves harder and harder.
Weight-lifting, too, is r ewarding.
Unforgettable, however, r emains a jump fr om the light-house. ln the Golden Age traces of
Paradise can still be discerned.
Her e, for ex ample, a boat once landed.
Furiously the waves beat against the shor e. ln the backgr ound, smoke is rising, that is to say...
... not even worse than you expected.
Stones that wer e cast do not r eturn by themselves. ln the Golden Age, man does not forget to pray...
... lest God's end be uncomely.
Mor e than by death, even, blessing, and curses...
... man is perturbed by smoke over the world.
Beneath the earth the childr en have found a fir e.
And now the par ents wish suddenly to r eturn to houses of stone.
That's enough, even one of these thoughts would have done.
...and yet, you'r e forcing harvests fr om this mysterious soil. lts thriving brings pain as well as joy to the field-workers. lt's difficult not to encounter a camel on the wayside...
...typically harnessed as a pack, work, or riding animal.
Riding animal!
And her e, as soon as we turn to the right...
...the visitor's joy is gone.
The view is horrifying, and almost silence is necessary.
Pr epar ed for something, we ask ourselves...
...''Wher e ar e we going?''
And silence is the answer.
We'r e gliding thr ough the landscape and it seems as if...
...this tragic mission of strange beauty yet otherwise hell...
...will never end.
We cannot withstand this sight for long...
...and an inner voice urges us to look at the vigor ous plant gr owth...
...that we ar e forcing fr om the earth.
What can we learn fr om the turtle?
She has four fins which she uses to move forward.
She has a hard shell and a hard belly.
Her e she has the head with the mouth wher e she eats.
And she has a r ear end wher e it comes out again. l'm going to get her again.
Ther e is nothing like the
Peace of the Golden Age...
War is pr oclaimed dead by Peace.
Nothing is gr eat as the sand...
Nothing is gr eat as the Peace.
The land is entranced with Peace.
